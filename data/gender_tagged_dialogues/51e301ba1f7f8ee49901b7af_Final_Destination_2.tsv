F	KIMBERLY	Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.
M	MR. BU RROUGHS	You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?

M	MR. BURROUGHS	Fix -A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
M	SHAINA (O.S.)	Condoms, handcuffs, lube?
F	SHAINA	Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	Oh, that makes me feel a lot better.
F	KIMBERLY	I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	I know, honey. I just --
M	MR. BURROUGHS	Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
F	KIMBERLY	I know, Dad. Hello, the guys are waiting!
M	MR. BURROUGHS	Buckle up!
M	SHAINA (O.S.)	Watch it!
F	KIMBERLY	Sorry! My fault!

M	DANO	Christ, is this tribute to Princess Di Day or what? Jesus, all the crazies are out today.
F	KIMBERLY	I told you no drugs in the car! My dad will freak!
M	DANO	Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
M	FRANKIE	Yeah, you should have specified.
M	MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)	Kimberly? It's Dad.
F	KIMBERLY	Hey, Dad. What's up? Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
F	KIMBERLY	You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
M	MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)	I mean it. Take care of it.
F	KIMBERLY	I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
F	SHAINA	Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he?
M	DANO	Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now!
M	DANO	Look first, idiot!
F	SHAINA	Ignore 'em.
F	KIMBERLY	Dano, put that out NOW. won't be able to pitch the campaign. Let's get Silverstein to come in and...
F	KAT	What the hell? No, not you.
M	DANO	What's the cop doing? Did he see that?
F	KAT	Forget it, I'll call him myself. I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed?
M	DISPATCHER (O.S.)	No biggie. Drake called in sick.
M	THOMAS	Copy that. Go on, sleep it off Drake.
M	FRANKIE	Relax, dude.
F	KIMBERLY	This trip better be wor th it. What's the guy- girl ratio again?
F	SHAINA	Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
F	KIMBERLY	I can live with thaaaa --
M	FRANKIE	What's your problem, ya fuckin' crack baby?!
F	ISABELLA	...couldn't Keep your dick in check for another month? I knew this would happen when I got pregnant.
F	ISABELLA	What'd the doctor say? I have to come in to test for STDs? Goddamn Gas it around these idiots. We do have 1200 miles to go, you know.
F	NORA	Tim, will you cut that out? I can't even hear myself think.
F	NORA	I know, we'll be there soon.
M	FRANKIE	Ever hear of the Ozone layer, asshole?
M	THOMAS	Son of a bitch.
M	FRANKIE	A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block. Knight Rider?
M	FRANKIE	Who?
M	DANO	You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch.
F	KIMBERLY	What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
F	SHAINA	How does a nice mature fuck sound?
F	KIMBERLY	Hey, thanks for talking me into this trip. Ever since my mom... I dunno, I just feel like I'm starting to live again, you know? swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a Flight 180. You know, that plane crash with those kids from Mount Abraham.
M	FRANKIE	Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
M	DANO	Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly.
F	KIMBERLY	Oh my god, oh my god...
F	SHAINA	What is it? What are you?
F	KIMBERLY	There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die. All of us! I saw it! That's it. My turn to drive. Flight 180. Y'know, that plane crash with those kids from Mt. Abraham?
M	FRANKIE	Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
M	DANO	Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimmy.
F	KIMBERLY	Oh my God, oh my God...
F	SHAINA	What is it? What are you?
F	KIMBERLY	There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it! That's it. My turn to drive. out.
F	KIMBERLY	Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
F	SHAINA	For Christ sakes girl, take a breath. Taking you into an all request weekend with a classic from AC/DC.
M	DANO	What the hell are you doing?
M	DANO	Five-O's coming! Let's fucking roll, man!
M	FRANKIE	Jesus Christ! Here he comes! Move!
F	KIMBERLY	No! We'll all die if we do!
M	DANO	I told you she'd ruin everything!
F	SHAINA	Shut up, Dano, just stay cool. He's just stoned.
M	THOMAS	What's going on here?
F	KIMBERLY	There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.
M	THOMAS	Miss, please step out of the vehicle.
F	ISABELLA	Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a delivery.
F	ISABELLA	Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on?
F	NORA	What on Earth are they doing?
M	TIM	Who am I, David Blane?
M	TIM	Okay, quit it already.
F	KIMBERLY	The radio played the same songs, the old lady's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition.
F	KIMBERLY	THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
M	THOMAS	Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
F	KIMBERLY	You're not listening to me! You have to do something!
M	EVAN	Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us have lives, y'know.
F	KIMBERLY	Why won't anyone listen to me?
M	THOMAS	I'm not going to tell you to calm down again --
F	ISABELLA	You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month?!
F	KAT	Great, now I'm really gonna be late.
M	THOMAS	L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major T.A. At --
F	SHAINA	Kimberly, what's going on?
M	EVAN	I don't know what you want from me. Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there'd be an accident and there was. Big deal. Even a broken watch is right twice a day...
F	KAT	Not to sound insensitive, but how much longer is this going to take?
M	EUGENE	If I don't get back to my classroom soon, the kids'll tear the room apart.
F	NORA	Those poor people. To think it would've been us if not for...
M	THOMAS	Tell me again how it started.
F	KIMBERLY	Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
M	THOMAS	Do you remember what triggered it all?
F	KIMBERLY	The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
M	THOMAS	You knew? You just mean a hunch, right? A bad vibe, maybe?
F	KIMBERLY	More than that. All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together. She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on. His car was leaking oil all over the road.
M	RORY	Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
F	KIMBERLY	Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...
M	THOMAS	Like what?
F	KIMBERLY	I know this sounds crazy...but you all heard about Flight 180, right? The kid who got off the plane?
M	THOMAS	You mean Alex Browning.
F	KIMBERLY	...My Premonition was just like his.
F	NORA	What are you talking about?
M	EUGENE	
M	Oh, you must have read about that	kid who had a dream about a plane crash so he got his buddies off the plane? Then the thing blew up just like in the dream?
F	NORA	Maybe...
M	EUGENE	But this is where it starts to get freaky. So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one. 'Cause when your number's up, it's up, right? Some people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead.
M	THOMAS	Well, not quite all of them. Clear Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook.
F	KIMBERLY	You do believe me, don't you?
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Officer Burke? Could I see you in here?
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you? irresponsible and unprofessional.
M	THOMAS	Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. Never mind.
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
M	KIMBER LY	But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up.
M	TIM	Which means Death could be coming for us.
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Way to console the witnesses Burke.
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn unlucky. happening all over again?
F	NORA	You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
M	TIM	Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
M	EUGENE	Look lady, we're just yankin' your chain.
M	RORY	Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something.
F	NORA	What's wrong with you people?
M	MR. BURROUGHS	Kimberly...
M	MR. BURROUGHS	Can I take her home?
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Sure, you can all go.
F	KAT	First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
M	RORY	Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
F	KIMBERLY	I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	What feeling?
F	KIMBERLY	That it's not over yet.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	Don 't worry. Everything will be fine, you'll see.
M	EVAN	Motherfucker. Dude! You suck! You buy one fucking ticket in your whole life and win twenty grand? We're going whoring in Prague, you know this! Hold on, the boss is coming.
M	EVAN	Damn it!
M	EVAN	Jesus Christ!
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department.
M	THOMAS	You've made your point.
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me.
M	THOMAS	What?
M	DETECTIVE SUBY	Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
F	KAT	No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day. Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go. Route 18 was backed up for almost nine hours today when a record breaking pile up... ...killed An estimated 18 people. Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage. ...hoping To recover any survivors from this tragic collision. So far, the police are refusing to release the names of the victims until their families are notified. The camera of a highway patrol car managed to catch this shocking footage --
M	MR. BURROUGHS	My Lord...
F	KIMBERLY	Don't. I have to see this.
M	RORY	Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there? That's my fuckin' car right there! Oh God, that's dope.
M	ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)	In other news, a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner.
F	NORA	Come on, Tim, lights out already.
M	TIM	Mom?
F	NORA	Yeah?
M	TIM	You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
F	NORA	Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all.
F	NORA	Get some sleep.
F	NORA	Officer Burke, please?
F	KIMBERLY	It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten anymore.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe.
F	KIMBERLY	I love you too, Dad. Goodnight.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	You know, after your mother died...
M	MR. BURROUGHS	There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the
F	KIMBERLY	I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away.
M	MR. BURROUGHS	I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
M	PHYSICIAN	...at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces...
M	PHYSICIAN	...paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications. You have a cell phone on you?
M	PHYSICIAN	Then I think we're all done.
F	KIMBERLY	Wait. Is she...dangerous or something?
M	PHYSICIAN	No honey, but she expects you are.
F	KIMBERLY	Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way?
M	PHYSICIAN	Depends on her, I guess. She's voluntary.
F	KIMBERLY	Clear Rivers?
F	CLEAR	Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
F	KIMBERLY	I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
F	CLEAR	Yeah, how?
F	KIMBERLY	I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
F	CLEAR	Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me. But I doubt you'll survive that long.
F	KIMBERLY	It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
F	CLEAR	Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
F	KIMBERLY	What list?
F	CLEAR	Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
F	CLEAR	The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
F	KIMBERLY	Exact order? Then I'm next! I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
F	CLEAR	But you said someone else died last night. That means Death skipped past you. Someone must have intervened. Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.
F	KIMBERLY	Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
F	CLEAR	Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does.
F	KIMBERLY	That still doesn't make sense. You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
F	CLEAR	It's moving backwards? Are you sure?
F	KIMBERLY	Yes. In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died first, then Evan and then...my friends.
F	CLEAR	Backwards...that's new.
F	CLEAR	That's good. Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes. For the signs.
F	KIMBERLY	Signs?
F	CLEAR	If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your- face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and death.
F	KIMBERLY	The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
F	CLEAR	That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
F	KIMBERLY	It's obvious you know what you're talking about. You beat it. You have to help us.
F	CLEAR	I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. That's the worst killer of them all.
F	KIMBERLY	How can you say that? What kind of monster are you?
F	CLEAR	My family is dead. My friends are dead. And Alex...
F	CLEAR	And yes, that's the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head.
F	KIMBERLY	Know what? I think you're a coward. I think you hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to care about another already dead.
M	THOMAS	I tried calling last night but your father --
F	KIMBERLY	Evan Shaeffer's dead.
M	THOMAS	I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
F	KIMBERLY	Then you believe all this?? That Death is working off a list?
M	THOMAS	I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
F	KIMBERLY	Clean up? I don't...
M	KI MBERLY	Did you see that??
F	KIMBERLY	Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by Pigeons!
M	THOMAS	I'm not following you --
F	KIMBERLY	They're next on the list. We have to find them.
M	TIM	You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
F	NORA	Nice try, kiddo.
M	TIM	Mom!
M	TIM	You okay?
F	NORA	Sure hon. I'm fine. Let's shake it, we're late.
M	TIM	Not so much.
F	KIMBERLY	Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
M	THOMAS	Hold on.
M	DR. LEES (O.S.)	I'm a little disappointed, Tim. Does your mom know you've been smoking?
M	DR. LEES (O.S.)	Yeah, that'll have to be filled.
M	DR. LEES	Jesus. Every day at the same damn time. Now this'll only sting for a moment.
M	DR. LEES	Open big. Wiiiiider...
M	DR. LEES	How the hell do they expect me to... Would you rather have the laughing gas?
M	DR. LEES	Jean? I need you in here. Jean??!
M	DR. LEES	Open big. Wiiiiiider.
M	DR. LEES	Goddamn it already.
M	TIM	What are they doing here? And why are they yelling "pigeons"?
M	THOMAS	Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son.
F	KIMBERLY	We have to tell her she's in danger!
M	THOMAS	I did. And right now, I don't think she cares.
F	KIMBERLY	It's happening again. It's fucking there and they'd be okay, that Clear Rivers was full of shit and Evan's death was just a freak accident...
F	KIMBERLY	But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared.
M	THOMAS	I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me.
M	THOMAS	I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either.
F	KIMBERLY	Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.
F	KIMBERLY	The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.
F	CLEAR	I hope you're ready for this.
F	KIMBERLY	This is cheery.
M	THOMAS	Who is this guy, anyway?
F	CLEAR	A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
M	THOMAS	Should we knock?
F	CLEAR	He probably already knows we're coming.
M	MORTICIAN	Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an eye out for you.
F	KIMBERLY	Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.
M	MORTICIAN	Come to... Pick my brain?
M	MORTICIAN	Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation. Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final --
F	CLEAR	Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend.
M	MORTICIAN	Fire away.
F	CLEAR	How do you cheat Death once and for all?
M	MORTICIAN	Dead. But still fresh.
F	CLEAR	Look, we drove a long way to get here. So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us.
M	MORTICIAN	For what purpose? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door. You can't cheat Death; there
F	CLEAR	Bullshit. You told me Death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable. But Alex and I cheated Death not once, but dozens of times. If the design is flawed, it can be beaten.
M	MORTICIAN	Such fire in you now. People are always most alive just before they die. Don't you think?
F	CLEAR	It can be beaten. And you know it.
M	MORTICIAN	Some say that there is a balance to everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life...
M	MORTICIAN	Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death. The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s.
M	MORTICIAN	The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence.
M	THOMAS	What the hell does that mean?
M	MORTICIAN	To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s.
M	MORTICIAN	But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them.
F	CLEAR	One last question. Why is Death working backwards this time?
M	MORTICIAN	Sorry, time's up.
M	THOMAS	New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
F	KIMBERLY	Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
F	CLEAR	He was. If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what "new life" means. I know, it worries me that I
F	CLEAR	What the fuck are you thinking?
M	SKATE RAT	I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee yatch.
M	THOMAS	What is it? What did you see?
F	KIMBERLY	I...I...
F	CLEAR	You're strong. Do you hear me? You're a fucking warrior. Nothing scares you. In fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth. Now what did you see?
F	KIMBERLY	I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible.
F	CLEAR	You were there?
F	KIMBERLY	I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
F	CLEAR	Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
M	THOMAS	Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
F	CLEAR	Holy shit. He said "only new life can defeat death." If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
F	KIMBERLY	It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch. We all start over with a clean slate.
M	THOMAS	It sounds all well and good, but
F	CLEAR	Please, what else could it mean?
F	KIMBERLY	So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
F	CLEAR	So let's do it.
M	THOMAS	Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.
F	KIMBERLY	How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
M	THOMAS	Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
F	KIMBERLY	Oh God...
M	THOMAS	I, uh...sorry.
F	KIMBERLY	I know, I know. We need my eyes.
F	CLEAR	It's all right. I'll take watch.
F	KIMBERLY	I'm okay. Just caught me by surprise. Put it back on.
F	CLEAR	Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
M	THOMAS	Taken care of.
F	KIMBERLY	There it is.
M	THOMAS	Got it.
F	CLEAR	I don't get it. Why is everything happening so fast? After Flight 180. A month went by before anyone died. And now five people are dead in less than a day.
M	THOMAS	Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
F	CLEAR	We need to hurry.
M	THOMAS	Let's lay this on her gently now. The stress alone could upset the pregnancy.
M	JORGE	What?
M	THOMAS	I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
M	JORGE	Shut up!!!
M	THOMAS	Are you Jorge Cruz?
M	JORGE	Maybe. What's this about?
M	THOMAS	May we come in?
M	JORGE	No. What's this about?
M	THOMAS	It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here?
M	JORGE	No. I'm alone.
M	THOMAS	Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see --
M	JORGE	Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer.
M	JORGE	Stop!!! You can't go in there!!!
M	YOUNG WOMAN	We never meant to hurt you Isa...You're not Isabella!
M	JORGE	I'm going to sue your ass!
F	KIMBERLY	Whose blood is that on the floor?
M	JORGE	Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her!
F	KIMBERLY	Where's Isabella? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater?
M	JORGE	We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.
M	THOMAS	What was the fight about?
M	JORGE	Take a guess.
M	THOMAS	Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
M	JORGE	She did.
F	CLEAR	We're wasting time with this piece of shit. Let's just get to the meeting.
M	JORGE	Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine.
F	CLEAR	We can only pray it doesn't come out retarded.
M	MAN	Jesus Christ. I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers.
M	RORY	Damn, is that dogshit?
F	NORA	Does anybody have a Valium?
F	KAT	You'll want to take --
F	KAT	-- half of that.
M	THOMAS	Any word yet on the Dodge van? Damn.
F	NORA	So that would mean... I'm next.
M	EUGENE	Nobody's next. This is crazy. First death's stalking us and now premonitions?
F	KAT	This can't be happening. My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
M	RORY	Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
F	CLEAR	You're not next, Nora. Nobody has to be next. That's the point. Last time, we didn't plan. We weren't organized. Now we can help each other.
F	CLEAR	Think what would have happened if Kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons...
F	KIMBERLY	The point is, as long as you know what to beware of, you have a fighting chance. It can be beaten. If I call you and say subway, get to a high rise fast. A place where no subway could possibly go, get it?
M	RORY	Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the first place? That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.
F	CLEAR	Anyone read today's paper? The article on Evan Shaeffer?
F	CLEAR	The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
M	RORY	That lucky bastard.
F	CLEAR	What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?
F	KIMBERLY	The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so...
M	THOMAS	Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so I got... Drake's never sick.
F	KAT	I was my first day of jury duty.
M	EUGENE	Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
F	CLEAR	Random, sure.
M	EUGENE	What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts.
M	RORY	Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
F	KAT	Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
M	RORY	Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
M	RORY	Stadium is Route 18.
F	KIMBERLY	I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
M	THOMAS	Whoa, nine months?
F	KIMBERLY	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
F	ISABELLA	Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here.
F	KIMBERLY	I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. I love you too.
F	CLEAR	Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent.
M	RORY	It's like Forrest Gump.
F	CLEAR	Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The institution's made me soft.
M	EUGENE	If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us.
F	KIMBERLY	We need her. She's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot!
F	CLEAR	We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts. And we've got to safeproof this deathtrap.
F	KAT	Screw this. I'm going outside for a smoke.
M	THOMAS	You think you should? It's not safe out there.
F	KAT	So? Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right?
F	KIMBERLY	Where are you going, Nora? You okay?
F	NORA	Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim. There's nothing left for me.
F	KIMBERLY	Don't say that. Once you lose hope, it's already too late.
F	NORA	If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then I can accept that.
F	KIMBERLY	You can't give up. Don't accept Death's plan. Trust me, you can fight this. If we can just survive long enough until that baby is born, we can --
F	NORA	If you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to prepare.
M	EUGENE	Yeah, why am I listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house?
F	KIMBERLY	Seeing you die once was enough for me.
M	EUGENE	Whatever. I control my life, not fate.
F	CLEAR	I'll be sure to put that on your tombstone.
M	RORY	Be careful. And even if you don't believe, give this to Nora.
M	RORY	...man with hooks. I see a man with hooks. Someone?!?!
M	THOMAS	I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's going to be killed by a man with hooks?
M	EUGENE	Going down, right?
M	EUGENE	Um, by the way, your shoe's untied.
M	EUGENE	Probably for you, anyway.
F	NORA	Officer Burke? I can't hear...
M	EUGENE	What is it? What's wrong?
F	NORA	Let me go let me go!
M	EUGENE	Oh, watch it, you've caught your uh...
M	MAN	Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with...
F	KAT	You alright, Nora?
F	NORA	My God, someone please let me out of this --
M	EUGENE	...no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?!
M	THOMAS	What the hell are you...?
M	EUGENE	Ain't going out like that. On my terms!
M	THOMAS	Just take it easy!
F	KIMBERLY	You don't keep it loaded?
M	RORY	Maybe they were all duds.
M	THOMAS	Six in a row? Never. Impossible. That's like ...winning the lottery. It wasn't his turn to die.
F	KAT	Can we find the pregnant woman, please?
M	EUGENE	Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about before. I...
F	CLEAR	Your entire world view just went out the window. I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this. I promise.
M	RORY	Can I ask you a question?
F	KIMBERLY	Sure.
M	RORY	When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
F	KIMBERLY	I...I don't know.
M	RORY	And you're gonna die after me, right?
F	KIMBERLY	I guess so.
M	RORY	Would you take these? And if I die... Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
M	THOMAS	A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella Cruz is being detained up in Greenwood. Let's finish this thing.
M	RORY	Is this safe, guys? I mean, someone in this car is about to get whacked. Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him? Or her. Hopefully her.
M	THOMAS	Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's safe.
F	KIMBERLY	How do you know?
M	THOMAS	You said she was going to drive into a lake. How can she when she's in protective custody?
F	ISABELLA	What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
M	STEVE	Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning.
F	ISABELLA	Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
M	IS ABELLA	Oh my God.
M	STEVE	Are you kidding me?! Oh, man.
M	STEVE	C'mon. Let's go.
M	STEVE	Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
F	ISABELLA	Take my van!
M	RORY	Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
F	KAT	Yeah?
M	RORY	But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
M	THOMAS	You want weird? Last year, my partner and I were heading out for the graveyard shift. A call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone. Frank died that night in a shootout. I'd be dead too if that call had come in just ten seconds later.
F	KAT	I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
M	RORY	Yeah, so what happened?
F	KAT	I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
F	CLEAR	Was that in Mt. Abraham?
F	KAT	Yeah. How did you know?
F	CLEAR	That bus you were on? It killed Terry Mathers. She was supposed to die on Flight 180.
F	KAT	I'm not sure I--
M	THOMAS	Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.
M	RORY	Who?
F	KIMBERLY	Another kid from Flight 180.
F	ISABELLA	Promise me...I won't have the
F	ISABELLA	Get around it!!!
M	RORY	Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed last year, killed everyone inside?
M	RORY	I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
F	CLEAR	Carter.
M	RORY	Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show... anyone from Flight- ?
M	EUGENE	Are you okay?
F	KIMBERLY	A little over a year ago, my mother and I went to the mall. I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide. I kept thinking, "How can you strangle yourself in a bathtub?" That's retarded.
F	KIMBERLY	It felt wrong. And yet... There were gunshots outside and I ran... Some kids tried to jack her car. She fought them off - she was a fighter - and they killed her.
F	KIMBERLY	After the funeral I had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me. I figured that's how everyone must feel. But I guess I was right.
F	CLEAR	It's all starting to come together. When Alex got us off Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives. It
M	affected everyone and everything	we've come into contact with ever since.
M	EUGENE	I'm not sure I understand.
F	CLEAR	Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
M	EUGENE	So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be ali ve in the first place.
F	CLEAR	That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all ­
M	STEVE	Hang on!
M	STEVE	We're okay, we're okay.
F	ISABELLA	Please. It's not going to wait.
M	STEVE	I've got to stop and help those people.
F	ISABELLA	Do you want to deliver this baby?
F	KAT	Not my time. Amazing...
M	THOMAS	Is everybody alright?
F	KAT	He can't breathe! He can't breathe!
F	CLEAR	Oh my god, Eugene!?
M	MR. GIBBONS (O.S.)	Call 9- 1-1!
M	THOMAS	Stop it, don't move him! his lung's collapsed!
F	CLEAR	Someone call for help!
F	KAT	I can't move my fucking leg! Please get me out of here before it explodes!
M	RORY	Watch it, dude!
F	KIMBERLY	Help us, we need help over here!
M	BRIAN	I don't smell any gas. And none's dripping, either.
F	KAT	Stop that! I still need this foot, thank you.
F	CLEAR	Be careful with that, check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch for potholes and puddles.
F	CLEAR	Look, I made him a promise --
M	PARAMEDIC	Sorry. There's no room.
M	THOMAS	Get that over here! Move move move!
M	RESCUE WORKER	Excuse me, hot soup coming through.
F	CLEAR	One more thing. Watch out for power lines.
F	CLEAR	We have to contact Isabella now!
M	THOMAS (O.S.)	Rory!!!
M	THOMAS	Where's the cell phone Clear gave you?
M	RORY	I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place.
M	THOMAS	Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella.
F	KIMBERLY	You doing alright in there?
F	KAT	My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji?
F	KAT	Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal?
M	COP	She's at Phelps Memorial. They're prepping her to give birth right now.
M	THOMAS	Where's that?
M	COP	A few miles up the road. Near the docks.
F	KAT	Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing?
M	RESCUE WORKER	Sure, I'll just set it to the "quiet" mode.
M	THOMAS	We gotta go now. Isabella's in labor.
F	KIMBERLY	What about that?
F	CLEAR	How you doing in there, hero?
F	KAT	I guess it could be worse.
M	THOMAS	So let's go...Where the hell is Rory?!
F	KIMBERLY	Wait!
F	CLEAR	Get back!
F	MR. GIBBONS	I didn't mean to do it - I didn't know.
F	KIMBERLY	It wasn't his turn. And it's not my turn.
F	KIMBERLY	Give me the keys to your truck. Now!
F	MR. GIBBONS	Anything you want. Anything. I wish I knew. I didn't...
M	THOMAS	Hurry up. There's no time. She's about to give birth. to kill us!
F	KIMBERLY	No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
F	CLEAR	Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
F	KIMBERLY	What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
F	CLEAR	Six duds in a row.
F	KIMBERLY	And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
M	THOMAS	That branch fell and saved my life. You're right, Death's maintaining the order.
F	KIMBERLY	Let's pray that Isabella's still alive.
M	STAFF	...contractions coming quicker now. Take her pressure and CTG. One centimeter dilation. Prep the epidural stat.
M	ANESTHESIOLOGIST	She's going to have to stop moving if I'm going to --
M	ANESTHESIOLOGIST	Goddamn it, keep her still!
M	NURSE	Sorry, doctor.
M	ANESTHESIOLOGIST	Perfectly still now...
M	ANESTHESIOLOGIST	Done. Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it?
F	KIMBERLY	This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
F	CLEAR	I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we
M	THOMAS	Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
F	CLEAR	If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
M	THOMAS	Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
F	KIMBERLY	Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
M	THOMAS	I wasn't worried about us. Kimberly! Slow down!
F	CLEAR	Slow down! We're...
F	CLEAR	What did you see? What am I looking for?
F	KIMBERLY	No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake. It wasn't just a sign, I was there.
F	CLEAR	Another premonition?
F	KIMBERLY	Yes. I was in a hospital. There was screaming... A nurse was choking me. I couldn't tell wh at she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face. Kalarjian.
M	THOMAS	Kalarjian?
F	KIMBERLY	I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death! trachea?
M	NURSE	Quite complaining. I got burnt babies in the Children's Ward braver than you.
M	NURSE	Don't bother. You won't be talking for at least a month. Think you can handle that, Jabberjaw?
M	NURSE	Don't worry. Everyone learns to love me once they get used to my sense of humor, okay?
F	KIMBERLY	Shouldn't we pull over?
M	THOMAS	No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
F	KIMBERLY	Oh come on.
F	KIMBERLY	What do you want me to do?
F	CLEAR	Speed up.
F	KIMBERLY	Yeah, fuck 'em. No offense.
F	CLEAR	Be alive, Isabella, please be alive.
M	ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)	...ironically impaled through the head as a result of an emergency airbag deploying.
M	ORDERLY	Need a pen? Sure. If you like, I'll bring crosswords for you, too. ...police Have speculated that one of the deaths may have been
M	narcotics related and urge children	to stay away from d rugs.
M	ANCHOR MAN	Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather...
M	ORDERLY	Jeez, it's freezing in here.
M	ADMINISTRATOR	What are you doing? The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward --
M	ORDERLY	Right, right, right. Gregory's big day.
M	ADMINISTRATOR	And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy can't feel her legs.
M	ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)	Mor e tears were shed this morning in the wake of yesterday's tragedy that rocked the Tri -State area...
F	CLEAR	Isabella Cruz. What room's she in?
M	RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry, I can't give out that info unless you're a relative.
F	CLEAR	I'm her sister.
M	RECEPTIONIST	I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz.
F	CLEAR	Delivery rooms are downstairs. I'll find Eugene and catch up with you.
M	THOMAS	Hurry, I think she's this way.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Security?
M	OBSTETRICIAN	Listen to me, Isabella, I need you to stop pushing.
F	ISABELLA	What's wrong? IS the baby all right?
M	OBSTETRICIAN	It's a breach. If I can't reverse
M	STEVE	Maybe I should step outside.
M	PA ANNOUNCEMENT	Code Blue in Delivery Room 6. Code Blue!
F	CLEAR	
M	SECURITY GUARD	Just where do you think you're going?
M	OBSTETRICIAN	Almost there. I see the head...
M	NURSE	What are you doing in here? Get the hell out! Right now!
M	OBSTETRICIAN	Isabella, look down and see your son.
F	CLEAR	A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
M	THOMAS	Don't sweat it. It's over.
F	CLEAR	She had the baby?
F	KIMBERLY	New life defeats death. We've done it. Death has to rewrite the list. We're safe. laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her.
M	THOMAS (O.S.)	Kimberly! Are you okay?!
M	THOMAS	Are you okay? You just face planted!
F	KIMBERLY	I know how it feels to be dead.
F	CLEAR	What did you see?
F	KIMBERLY	I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
M	THOMAS	But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?
F	KIMBERLY	I don't...what if I made a mistake?
M	THOMAS	Impossible. She was on the onramp.
F	KIMBERLY	I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up.
M	THOMAS	Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
F	CLEAR	Can you remember anything about it?
F	KIMBERLY	...the Same hands from the van.
F	CLEAR	It's you Kimberly. The premonitions are about you.
F	KIMBERLY	No! It can't be.
F	CLEAR	I have to save Eugene!
F	CLEAR	Eugene? Are you in there?
M	CLEAR (O.S.)	Can you hear me? I'm coming in .
M	ORDERLY (O.S.)	Make way, make way lovebirds.
F	KIMBERLY	Oh no...
M	ORDERLY	Thanks hon, the Henzels are going crazy for this thing.
F	KIMBERLY	Nurse Kalarjian...
M	DR. KALARJIAN	Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me, please.
F	KIMBERLY	Oh my God. That's it. The lake. The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.
M	THOMAS	What?
F	KIMBERLY	You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
M	THOMAS	That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing.
F	KIMBERLY	I have to do this.
M	EMT	What the fuck?!
M	DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.)	Ready and...CLEAR!
M	NURSE	She's back!
M	DR. KALARJIAN	Five CC's of narcodon. I want her stabilized and prepped for ICU.
M	THOMAS	Kimberly?!
F	KIMBERLY	Welcome back. We did it. For real.
M	THOMAS	I know. I can feel it too.
F	KIMBERLY	My God, this is delicious. I can't believe I used to be a vegan.
M	MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.)	So what's the deal, Thomas? Three months and you still haven't asked my daughter out on a date.
M	THOMAS	What's wrong with a platonic relationship?
F	MR. GIBBONS	Platonic my ass. That's for ugly women.
F	KIMBERLY	For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
M	THOMAS	Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
F	MR. GIBBONS	Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone. Besides, if you can beat Death,
M	what's he got to worry about me	for?
F	MR. GIBBONS	You know, you still never explained to us how you did it.
M	THOMAS	Well, technically when we died, we gave Death what it wanted. And by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures.
F	MRS. GIBBONS	You know, I'm having the greatest day?
F	KIMBERLY	Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons. Big props to you and Brian.
F	MRS. GIBBONS	Our...pleasure. So, ready for the back-to -school season? NYU, right?
F	KIMBERLY	Three short glorious weeks away.
F	MRS. GIBBONS	Sounds wonderful. I wish I were going myself.
F	MR. GIBBONS	You may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, Bob. Our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face. Among other places.
M	BRIAN (O.S.)	Dad used to call her the pincushion. From Hellraiser.
M	BRIAN	Dad, you had the spatula last, right?
F	MR. GIBBONS	Sure, here.
F	KIMBERLY	Brian looks like he's having fun.
F	MR. GIBBONS	Sure does. Owes it to that friend of yours, in a way.
F	KIMBERLY	How's that?
F	MR. GIBBONS	Well, Brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day...but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last second.
F	MRS. GIBBONS	You never told me that, Peter. Boy, that was lucky.
