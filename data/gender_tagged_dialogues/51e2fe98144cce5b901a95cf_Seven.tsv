M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MAN (O.S.)	Is something wrong?
M	MAN	Is there something the matter?
M	SOMERSET	No. No... it's just that everything here seems... so strange.
M	MAN	Strange? There's nothing strange about this place. The house'll need a little fixing up, that's for sure...
M	SOMERSET	No. I like the house, and this place.
M	MAN	I was about to say. Cause this place is about as normal as places get.
M	SOMERSET	That's what I mean. Strange.
M	CAB DRIVER	What's the big fuss?
M	SOMERSET	Why do you care?
M	CAB DRIVER	Well, excuse me all to hell.
M	CAB DRIVER	Crazy fucks.
M	CAB DRIVER	Where you headed?
M	SOMERSET	Far away from here.
M	TAYLOR	Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours. It was nothing new. But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
M	SOMERSET	Did the wife confess?
M	TAYLOR	When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.
M	SOMERSET	Why always like this? Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
M	TAYLOR	Crime of passion.
M	SOMERSET	Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
M	TAYLOR	This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.
M	SOMERSET	Did their son see it happen?
M	TAYLOR	I don't know.
M	TAYLOR	What kind of fucking question is that anyway?
M	TAYLOR	You know, we're all real glad we're getting rid of you, Somerset. You know that? I mean, it's always these questions with you... "Did the kid see it?" Well, who gives a fuck? Huh? He's dead. His wife killed him.
M	TAYLOR	Anything else has nothing to do with us.
F	MILLS	Uh, Lieutenant Somerset?
F	MILLS	I'm a little thrown. I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
M	SOMERSET	Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile. After that, we'll...
F	MILLS	Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
F	MILLS	I need to start getting the feel of it all, right? Meet the people.
M	SOMERSET	I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
F	MILLS	I... I don't follow.
M	SOMERSET	All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
F	MILLS	I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess. Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
M	SOMERSET	You just met me.
F	MILLS	Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
M	SOMERSET	It's very simple. You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it. I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
F	MILLS	Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. I don't know. Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls. But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
M	SOMERSET	Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
F	MILLS	I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell. I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
M	SOMERSET	Not here.
F	MILLS	I realize that.
M	SOMERSET	Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
F	TRACY	What is it?
F	MILLS	It's okay.
F	TRACY	Honey... where are we?
M	DAVIS	Everything's like I found it. I didn't touch anything.
M	SOMERSET	What time did you confirm the death?
M	DAVIS	Like I said, I didn't touch him, but he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about forty-five minutes now.
F	MILLS	Hold on... you mean you didn't check for vital signs?
M	DAVIS	Did I stutter? Believe me, he ain't breathing, unless he's started breathing spaghetti sauce.
F	MILLS	The point is, whenever you find...
M	DAVIS	Begging your pardon, but the guy's sitting in pile of his own shit and piss. If he ain't dead, he would've stood up by now.
M	SOMERSET	Thank you, officer. We'll need to talk to you again, after we've looked around.
M	DAVIS	Yes, sir.
M	SOMERSET	I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
F	MILLS	And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
M	SOMERSET	Drop it.
F	MILLS	For now.
M	ERIC	Enjoy.
F	MILLS	Christ... somebody phone Guinness. I think we've got a World's Record here.
F	MILLS	Who said this was murder?
M	SOMERSET	No one yet.
F	MILLS	Then, why are we wasting our time? This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham. If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
F	MILLS	Or not.
F	MILLS	Still... he could have tied himself up, to make it look like murder. I saw a guy once... committed suicide, but wanted to make sure his family could collect the life insurance, right?
F	MILLS	When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide? Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
M	SOMERSET	Please be quiet for a while, would you?
F	MILLS	Oh, yes, sir. Forgive me.
F	MILLS	There's a bucket here.
M	SOMERSET	What?
F	MILLS	There's a bucket. Under the table.
M	SOMERSET	What is it?
F	MILLS	It's vomit.
F	MILLS	It's a bucket of vomit.
M	SOMERSET	Is there any blood in it?
F	MILLS	I don't know. Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
M	O'NEILL	Wonderful.
F	MILLS	You think it was poison?
M	SOMERSET	Guessing at this point is useless.
M	O'NEILL	You girls have got forensics waiting outside. I don't know if we'll all fit though.
F	MILLS	There's room. Light's the problem.
M	SOMERSET	Still... two is company here. And, three is certainly a crowd. Detective Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors.
F	MILLS	I'd rather stay on this.
M	SOMERSET	Send one of the forensics in on your way out.
M	O'NEILL	He is dead.
M	SOMERSET	Thank you, Doctor.
F	MILLS	You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?
M	SOMERSET	No.
F	MILLS	Anyway... I did my time on door-to- doors, and walking a beat. I did all that shit for a long time.
M	SOMERSET	Good.
F	MILLS	The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
M	SOMERSET	I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene. I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
F	MILLS	Yeah, well, all I want is... Just, just don't be jerking me off. That's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
M	SOMERSET	We'll be spending every waking hour together till I leave. I'll show you who your friends are, and your enemies. I'll help you cut through the red tape and I will help you "integrate," as the captain puts it. However... No matter how much you beg or plead... jerking off is something you'll have to do for yourself.
M	SOMERSET	Is that clear?
F	MILLS	Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
M	SOMERSET	I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship. We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
F	MILLS	Whatever you say, Detective. Beautiful.
M	SANTIAGO	He's been dead for a long time, and I can tell you it was not a poison.
F	MILLS	Ah, man... how does somebody let himself go like that? Look at the blubber.
M	SANTIAGO	It took four orderlies and me all together just to put this body on the table.
F	MILLS	How did the fat fuck ever fit out the door of his apartment?
M	SOMERSET	Yes, it's obvious he was a shut-in. Not an enviable life, but, maybe he still deserves a modicum of respect in spite of that.
M	SANTIAGO	Are you looking here? First... see how big this stomach is. And, see the strange thing. Stretches. And, here it is distended. Look at the size of that, because of all the foods.
F	MILLS	I can see what you're pointing at, but...
M	SANTIAGO	Lines of distention across the stomach, and parts have ripped open.
M	SOMERSET	Doctor, are you saying... this man ate till he burst?
M	SANTIAGO	Well, he didn't really burst. Not all the way. But, he was bleeding inside himself, and there is a hematoma on the outside, on the belly. Very large.
F	MILLS	He died by eating?
M	SANTIAGO	Yes. And, there's something else here you have to look at and see.
M	SOMERSET	These bruises on the victim's head...
M	SANTIAGO	I don't know what they are yet. They...
M	SOMERSET	They could have been caused by a gun. The barrel of a gun... pressed against the back of his head.
M	SANTIAGO	If it was jammed against him hard enough, sure. It's possible. Here...
M	SANTIAGO	Most of the stomach's food contents are in the lab now... but, these... I found these in his stomach too.
F	MILLS	Plastic?
M	SANTIAGO	Why these are in a fat man's stomach, I don't know.
M	SOMERSET	Same color and texture.
F	MILLS	Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near the food?
M	MALE FORENSIC	What do you mean?
F	MILLS	This doesn't make any sense.
M	SOMERSET	You always have to find one singular thing to focus on. There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
F	MILLS	It could be nothing.
M	SOMERSET	But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing? It must have been intentional.
M	SOMERSET	Come here.
F	MILLS	Holy shit.
M	SOMERSET	The bruises were caused by the muzzle of a forty-five. So, there was a gun against his head and he was given a choice. Eat, or get your brains blown out.
M	SOMERSET	He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. The killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving. He took his time. The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours. The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out. That's when killer kicked him in the stomach. Popped him.
F	MILLS	This was one sadistic motherfucker.
M	CAPTAIN	That seems obvious.
M	SOMERSET	"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
M	CAPTAIN	Announcing what?
M	SOMERSET	There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
M	CAPTAIN	So what? This victim...
M	SOMERSET	...envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
M	CAPTAIN	Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. But, this was a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It's like the fashionable thing to do.
M	SOMERSET	One is gluttony.
F	MILLS	This is his stuff. I've been out in the cold all day.
M	SOMERSET	This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
M	CAPTAIN	Always working up there, huh, Somerset? Big brain's always cooking.
M	SOMERSET	I'm declining this case. I want us reassigned.
F	MILLS	Whoa, whoa... what?!
M	CAPTAIN	What's this: "I'm declining this case?" It don't work that way.
M	SOMERSET	This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
M	CAPTAIN	I know what you're thinking, okay? You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now. You're retiring. In six days you're all the way gone.
M	CAPTAIN	You've left unfinished business before.
M	SOMERSET	Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible. Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
F	MILLS	This isn't my first assignment, dickhead. What the hell?
M	CAPTAIN	I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that. And nobody's going to swap with you.
F	MILLS	Give it to me.
M	CAPTAIN	How's that?
F	MILLS	There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants out, "goodbye." Give it to me.
M	SOMERSET	It's too soon for him.
F	MILLS	Can we talk about this in private?
M	CAPTAIN	That's not necessary. You're in.
F	MILLS	Thank you.
M	CAPTAIN	Go start picking up the pieces. We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
M	CAPTAIN	You win, Somerset. You're out.
M	SOMERSET	Come in.
M	CAPTAIN	Excuse us. We have some business to take care of.
M	WORKMAN	Sorry.
M	CAPTAIN	Have you heard?
M	SOMERSET	No, I haven't heard.
M	CAPTAIN	There was a second.
M	SOMERSET	Already.
M	CAPTAIN	Greed. It was written in blood.
M	SOMERSET	It's none of my business anymore.
M	CAPTAIN	I thought you might want to be filled in.
M	SOMERSET	I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
M	CAPTAIN	Yeah.
M	SOMERSET	Good.
M	CAPTAIN	Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
M	SOMERSET	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.
M	CAPTAIN	Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling...? You're not going to be a cop anymore.
M	SOMERSET	What are you talking about?
M	CAPTAIN	You know.
M	SOMERSET	Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog? He was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken. And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened four blocks from here.
M	CAPTAIN	I heard.
M	SOMERSET	I have no understanding of this place anymore.
M	CAPTAIN	It's always been like this.
M	SOMERSET	Really?
M	SOMERSET	Maybe you're right.
M	CAPTAIN	You do this work. You were made for it, and I don't think you can deny that. I certainly can't believe you're trading it in for a tool belt and a fishing rod. Maybe I'm wrong.
M	SOMERSET	Try putting a little elbow grease into it.
M	VAGRANT	Spare me a cigarette? Spare a cigarette?
M	SOMERSET	Sorry, last one.
M	GEORGE	Sit where you'd like.
M	SOMERSET	Thanks, George.
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Hey there, Smilely.
M	SOMERSET	Evening, gentlemen.
M	FIRST GUARD	Come on, George. Cards are getting cold.
M	GEORGE	Duty calls.
M	SOMERSET	All these books, gentlemen... a world of knowledge at your disposal, and you play poker all night.
M	JANITOR	We got culture.
M	SECOND GUARD	Yeah, we got culture coming out our asses.
M	GEORGE	How's this for culture?
M	GEORGE	Where'd you get to, Smilely?
M	SOMERSET	Thank you.

M	SOMERSET	I just might. THE CANTERBURY TALES -- THE PARSON'S TALE DICTIONARY OF CATHOLICISM
F	MILLS	...good. Do it. I'm going back up.
M	FORENSIC ONE	...going to screw it up. I swear... I've seen...
F	MILLS	How's it coming?
M	FORENSIC ONE	Nothing yet.
M	ANCHOR (V.O.)	...going cut in live downtown right now, where Defense Attorney Eli Gould was found murdered in his office late last night. District Attorney Martin Talbot is taking questions from reporters...
M	A REPORTER (V.O.)	...a small conflict of interest here? I mean, your prosecutors have lost more than a few very high profile cases to Mister Gould and his defense team... Now, that's ridiculous to the point of almost being offensive. There's no conflict of interest whatsoever, and any claim that there would be, or could be, is irresponsible. Now, hold on... I want to address that. I've just come from a meeting with law enforcement officials, and they've assured me they put their best people on this thing.
M	TALBOT (V.O.)	You just wait and see how quickly we get a handle on it. This will be the very definition of swift justice.
F	MILLS	Shut the fuck up.
F	MILLS	Fucking, Dante, goddamn, poetry- writing, faggot motherfucker...
F	MILLS	Good work, Officer. Good work.
F	MILLS	Thank God.
M	SOMERSET	Let me get out of your way.
M	SOMERSET	It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office.
F	MILLS	Detective Mills here. Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back... What? Why?
F	MILLS	Why? Okay... okay, hold on.
F	MILLS	It's my wife.
M	SOMERSET	What?
M	SOMERSET	Hello? Yes, well... it's nice to speak to you. Well, I appreciate the thought... but... Then, I guess I'd be delighted. Thank you very much. Yes... goodbye.
F	MILLS	Well?
M	SOMERSET	I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.
F	MILLS	How's that?
M	SOMERSET	Tonight.
F	MILLS	I don't even know if I'm having dinner there tonight.
F	TRACY	Hello, men. You made it.
F	MILLS	Hi, honey.
F	MILLS	I'd like you to meet Somerset.
M	SOMERSET	Hello.
F	TRACY	It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
M	SOMERSET	Oh... um, William.
F	TRACY	It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David. David... William.
F	MILLS	Great... I'm, uh, just going to put these things away.
M	SOMERSET	It smells good.
F	TRACY	What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you. Please, sit down.
F	TRACY	You can put that over on the couch. You'll have to excuse all the mess. We're still unpacking.
M	SOMERSET	I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
F	TRACY	High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry. God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
M	SOMERSET	Really?
M	SOMERSET	Well, it's rare these days... that kind of commitment.
M	SOMERSET	Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.
F	TRACY	No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
M	SOMERSET	Same here.
F	TRACY	Anyway... what girl wouldn't want the captain of the football team as their lifetime mate? Here... you dropped something...
F	TRACY	What is that?
M	SOMERSET	My future.
F	TRACY	You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting. I'm sorry. It's really none of my business. It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that. If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag. That's how he is.
M	SOMERSET	I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
F	TRACY	Why aren't you married, William?
F	MILLS	Tracy... what the hell?
M	SOMERSET	I was close once. It just didn't happen.
F	TRACY	It surprises me. It really does.
M	SOMERSET	Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
F	MILLS	Very true.
F	TRACY	How long have you lived here?
M	SOMERSET	Too long. What do you think so far?
F	MILLS	It takes time to settle in.
M	SOMERSET	Well, you can get numb to it pretty quickly. There are things in any city...
F	MILLS	Subway train.
F	TRACY	It'll go away in a minute.
F	MILLS	This real estate guy... this miserable fuck, he brought us to see this place a few times. And, first I'm thinking he's good, really efficient. But then, I started wondering, why does he keep hurrying us along? Why will he only show us this place for like five minutes at a time?
F	TRACY	We found out the first night.
M	SOMERSET	The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home. Sorry...
F	MILLS	Oh, fuck.
F	TRACY	I don't think I've ever met anyone who doesn't have a television before. That's... weird.
F	MILLS	It's un-American is what it is.
M	SOMERSET	All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
F	MILLS	What about sports?
M	SOMERSET	What about them?
F	MILLS	You go to movies at least?
M	SOMERSET	I read. Remember reading?
F	MILLS	I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
F	MILLS	You've never seen "The Odd Couple?" This is sick. "The Honeymooners?!"
M	SOMERSET	I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
F	MILLS	Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up. Gould must have been working late.
M	SOMERSET	I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, actually.
F	MILLS	Well, his body was found Monday night, okay? But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday. Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday. He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
F	MILLS	Gould was tied down, nude. The killer left his arms free and handed him a big, sharp butcher's knife. See... the scale here.
M	SOMERSET	A pound of flesh.
M	SOMERSET	"One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done... and he would go free."
F	MILLS	The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
M	SOMERSET	All day Saturday, and all day Sunday. The murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut? There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
F	MILLS	He cut along the side of his stomach. The love handle.
M	SOMERSET	He must have left another puzzle piece.
F	MILLS	Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
M	SOMERSET	This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.
F	MILLS	Gould's wife. She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what. We've questioned her at least five times.
M	SOMERSET	And, if it's a threat.
F	MILLS	We put her in a safe house.
M	SOMERSET	Look at these with fresh eyes. Don't see what the killer wants you to. Don't let him guide you...
M	SOMERSET	Even if the corpse is right there... it's almost like looking through it. Editing out the initial shock. Look at the room.
M	SOMERSET	He's preaching.
F	MILLS	Punishing.
M	SOMERSET	The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
F	MILLS	Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
M	SOMERSET	Did you read them?
F	MILLS	Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
M	SOMERSET	Seven Terraces of Purgation.
F	MILLS	Right. But there, pride comes first, not gluttony. The sins are in a different order.
M	SOMERSET	For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin. And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
F	MILLS	Forced what?
M	SOMERSET	Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
F	MILLS	Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
M	SOMERSET	No fingerprints?
F	MILLS	Nothing.
M	SOMERSET	Totally unrelated victims.
M	SOMERSET	No witnesses of any kind?
F	MILLS	None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.
M	SOMERSET	In any major city, minding your own business is a perfected science. There's a public crime prevention course offered at the precinct house once a month. The first thing they teach is that you should never cry "help." Always scream "fire," because people don't want to get caught up in anything. But a fire... that's an evening's entertainment. They come running.
M	SOMERSET	This is the one thing.
F	MILLS	I know.
M	SOMERSET	What if it's not that she's seen something? What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
F	MILLS	Okay. But, what?
F	MILLS	I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really am.
M	MRS GOULD	I... I don't understand.
F	MILLS	I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place. Anything at all.
M	MRS GOULD	I don't know why... why now?
F	MILLS	Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
F	MILLS	Anything... anything missing or different.
M	MRS GOULD	I don't see anything.
F	MILLS	Are you absolutely certain?
M	MRS GOULD	I can't do this now... please.
F	MILLS	Maybe we better wait.
M	SOMERSET	It should be now. There may be something we're not seeing.
M	MRS GOULD	Wait. Here...
F	MILLS	What is it?
M	MRS GOULD	This painting...
F	MILLS	What?
M	MRS GOULD	Why is this painting hanging upside- down?
M	SOMERSET	You're sure your men didn't move this?
F	MILLS	Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
F	MILLS	Nothing.
M	SOMERSET	It's got to be.
M	SOMERSET	He changed the wire to rehang it.
F	MILLS	What the fuck is that?
M	SOMERSET	A switchblade.
F	MILLS	Nothing. Damn it!
F	MILLS	The killer didn't paint the fucking thing. Give it up.
M	SOMERSET	There must be something.
F	MILLS	We're screwed. He's fucking with us.
F	MILLS	Motherfucker!
F	MILLS	What?
M	SOMERSET	Bear with me.
F	MILLS	Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding?!
M	SOMERSET	Just wait!
M	SOMERSET	Call the print lab.
M	MALE FORENSIC	Oh, man... Talk to me.
F	MILLS	Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
M	SOMERSET	No. Well, I can tell you, boys...
M	MALE FORENSIC	...just by looking at the shape of the underloop on these, they are not the victim's fingerprints.
F	MILLS	He just may be nuts enough.
M	SOMERSET	It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop.
F	MILLS	Who the hell knows? There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do. You know... little voices tell them bad things.
M	TECHNICIAN	I've seen this baby take as long as three days to make a match, so you guys can go cross your fingers somewhere else.
M	SOMERSET	You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you? About catching this guy. You really want to believe that, don't you?
F	MILLS	And you don't?
M	SOMERSET	I wish I still thought like you.
F	MILLS	Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
M	SOMERSET	All we do is pick up the pieces. We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples. We write everything down and note what time things happened...
F	MILLS	Oh, that's all.
M	SOMERSET	We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom. It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
F	MILLS	Bullshit.
M	SOMERSET	I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
F	MILLS	I've seen the same. I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
M	SOMERSET	In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
F	MILLS	Don't tell me you didn't get that rush tonight... that adrenalin, like we were getting somewhere.
F	MILLS	And, don't try to tell me it was because you found something that would play well in a courtroom.
M	CAPTAIN	Wake up, Glimmer Twins. We have a winner.
M	CAPTAIN	He goes by the name Victor, as many of you know, and his prints were found on scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.
M	CAPTAIN	Now, this guy's a real beauty. He has a long, long history of serious mental illness. According the head- shrinkers, it seems his parents gave him a very strict, Southern Baptist upbringing, but somewhere along the line he dropped his marbles.
M	CAPTAIN	Hey, you two can shut-up now!
M	CAPTAIN	Thank you, fuckheads. Now, Victor spent a couple of months in prison for the attempted rape of an eight year old boy, but his lawyer made sure he didn't stay long. Before that, he dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault. We've been doing our best to keep an eye on him, but he's been out of circulation for a while.
M	FEMALE COP	If he disappeared, what do you want from us?
M	CAPTAIN	His last place of residence is still in his name. A search warrant is being pushed through the courts as we speak.
M	CALIFORNIA	So, have the housing cops walk up and ring the doorbell.
M	CAPTAIN	Listen, California. When you go in, if Victor isn't home, one of his buddies might be house-sitting, so you go in guns first. Besides using, Victor deals, and we know what kind of crowd he runs with.
M	CAPTAIN	This is what the D.A. has a hard-on for right now, Ladies and Germs, so we do not question why.
F	MILLS	Does this make it with you?
M	SOMERSET	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
F	MILLS	You tell me. I'm new in town.
M	SOMERSET	He doesn't have the desire somehow. Our killer seems to have more purpose. More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
F	MILLS	The fingerprints.
M	SOMERSET	Yes. They were there... so, it must be.
F	MILLS	We'll tag along.
M	SOMERSET	Why would we?
F	MILLS	Satisfy our curiosity?
F	MILLS	You ever take one?
M	SOMERSET	Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood. I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it. Never fired it though. Not once. You?
F	MILLS	Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. Fired it once.
M	SOMERSET	And?
F	MILLS	It was my first one of these. We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in. I was still considered a rookie.
F	MILLS	We busted the door, looking for this junkie, right? The geek just opened fire. Another cop was hit in the arm and he went flying... like in slow motion. I remember riding in the ambulance. His arm was like Jello. A piece of meat. He bled to death right there.
M	SOMERSET	How did the fire fight end?
F	MILLS	I got him. I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts. I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild. I got him with one shot... right between the eyes. Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
M	SOMERSET	How was it?
F	MILLS	I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.
M	SOMERSET	I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
F	MILLS	Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
M	CALIFORNIA	This is it. Give it up.
M	BLACK COP	Cops go before Dicks.
M	CALIFORNIA	Police! Open the door!!
M	CALIFORNIA	Good morning, sweetheart!
M	CALIFORNIA	Get up, now, motherfucker! NOW!
M	SOMERSET	Jesus...
M	CALIFORNIA	I said get up, Sleepyhead!
M	CALIFORNIA	Fuck me!
F	MILLS	Holy shit.
M	SOMERSET	Victor?
M	BLACK COP	What the hell...?
M	CALIFORNIA	Check this out, Dick...
F	MILLS	It is Victor.
M	SOMERSET	Call an ambulance.
M	BLOND COP	What the fuck is this?
M	CALIFORNIA	Somebody call a hearse, more like.
M	BLOND COP	What is going on?
F	MILLS	Hey, California, get your people out.
M	CALIFORNIA	You heard him. Hit the hall, and don't touch anything.
M	CALIFORNIA	It looks like he's some kind of friggin' sculpture or something.
F	MILLS	Somerset, you... you better look here.
F	MILLS	All pictures of Victor tied to the bed. The last one is dated three days ago.
M	SOMERSET	The first one... it's dated one year ago. To the day.
M	CALIFORNIA	Mother...
F	MILLS	What...?
M	CALIFORNIA	You got what you deserved, Victor.
F	MILLS	A urine sample, hair sample... stool sample. Finger nails... He laughing at us.
M	CALIFORNIA	He's alive!
M	CALIFORNIA	He's still alive!!
M	SOMERSET	The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
F	MILLS	I want him bad. I don't just want to catch him anymore. I want to hurt him.
M	SOMERSET	Listen to me. He's all about playing games.
F	MILLS	No kidding! No fucking kidding!
M	SOMERSET	We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here. No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
F	MILLS	I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
M	SOMERSET	He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
M	SOMERSET	Are you listening to me?
F	MILLS	I hear you.
M	REPORTER	Say cheese.
F	MILLS	What the fuck are you doing here?
M	REPORTER	I have a right, Officer. I...
F	MILLS	That doesn't mean anything! This is a closed crime scene!
M	REPORTER	You can't do this! You can't...
F	MILLS	Get the fuck out of here!
M	REPORTER (O.S.)	The public has a right to know!
F	MILLS	How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
M	SOMERSET	They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
F	MILLS	Sorry about that... I just...
M	SOMERSET	Oh, it's alright.
M	SOMERSET	It's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.
M	DOCTOR	A year of immobility seems about right, judging by the deterioration of the muscles and the spine. Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his systems; from crack to heroin... even an antibiotic which must have been administered to keep the bed sores from infecting.
F	MILLS	He hasn't said anything, or tried to express himself in any way?
M	DOCTOR	Even if his brain were not mush, which it is... he chewed off his own tongue long ago.
M	SOMERSET	There's no way he'll survive?
M	DOCTOR	Detective, he'd die right how of shock if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.
M	DOCTOR	It's funny to think... he's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered... give or take... and he still has hell to look forward to.
M	1 gluttony (x) 5 wrath	2 greed (x) 6 pride 3 sloth (x) 7 lust 4 envy
M	SOMERSET	Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month. He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him. He's the best tenant I've ever had.
F	MILLS	A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
M	SOMERSET	Who pays the rent on time.
F	MILLS	I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
M	SOMERSET	This is the job. It's not an Easter egg hunt.
F	MILLS	There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow. I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
M	SOMERSET	It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
F	MILLS	Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.
M	SOMERSET	It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
F	MILLS	Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh? Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
M	SOMERSET	No.
F	MILLS	Sooner or later his luck's going to run out.
M	SOMERSET	No. He's not depending on luck. You've seen that. We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day. To the day! Because he wanted us to.
F	MILLS	We don't know for sure...
M	SOMERSET	Yes we do. Here...
M	SOMERSET	This quote... his first words to us. I looked it up. It's from Milton's Paradise Lost. "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
F	MILLS	And so what?
M	SOMERSET	Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
F	MILLS	Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
M	SOMERSET	Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic. The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. To connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
F	MILLS	What does all that matter anyway? is it? All we have to do is catching him.
F	MILLS	What?
F	MILLS	What is it?
M	SOMERSET	How much money do you have?
F	MILLS	I don't know... like fifty.
M	SOMERSET	I propose a field trip.
F	MILLS	Somerset... what the fuck?
M	SOMERSET	At the top of the list, we'll put Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... anything relating to the seven deadly sins. Now, what the killer might research. What would he need to study to do the things he's done? What are his other interests? For example...
M	MAN	Take one, you stupid fucks! Here... take one! It's a fucking coupon! Take it!
M	SOMERSET	They had about fifty health violations during the last inspection.
F	MILLS	Could you at least sit across from me? I don't want people to thing we're dating.
M	SOMERSET	Give me your money.
F	MILLS	I'm handing you this, and for some strange reason, I have the idea I should know what the fuck we're doing.
M	GREASY MAN	Hey, Somerset. How are you? I didn't know this was going to be a menage-a- trois.
M	SOMERSET	It's not a problem.
M	GREASY MAN	Only for you do I do this. Big risk here... so I figure we'll be even- up. All fair and square.
M	GREASY MAN	About an hour.
F	MILLS	Well, that was money well spent.
M	SOMERSET	Let's go.
M	SOMERSET	By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
F	MILLS	It be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
M	SOMERSET	It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth. The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
F	MILLS	Him?
M	SOMERSET	For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accuate records.
F	MILLS	What? Assessing fines?
M	SOMERSET	They monitor reading habits. Not every book, but certain ones are flagged. Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
F	MILLS	You got to be kidding.
M	SOMERSET	Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
F	MILLS	How is this legal?
M	SOMERSET	Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
M	SOMERSET	They can't use the information directly, but it's a useful guide. It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card without i.d. and a current phone bill.
F	MILLS	So they ran our list.
M	SOMERSET	If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you. It might give us a name.
F	MILLS	Yeah. Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
M	SOMERSET	Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office. We've got pizza.
F	MILLS	How do you know all about this?
M	SOMERSET	I don't. Neither do you.
F	MILLS	This is a waste of time.
M	SOMERSET	We're focusing.
F	MILLS	I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
M	SOMERSET	The Divine Comedy. A History of Catholicism. A book called Murderers and Madmen.
F	MILLS	Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?
M	SOMERSET	It's not what you think it is.
F	MILLS	The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
M	SOMERSET	That is.
F	MILLS	The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
M	SOMERSET	Saint Thomas Aquinas. He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
F	MILLS	You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
M	SOMERSET	That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.
F	MILLS	This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.
M	SOMERSET	We'll take a look at him. Talk to him.
F	MILLS	Sure. Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer? Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
F	MILLS	What are you going to say?
M	SOMERSET	You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
F	MILLS	Who told you about my silver tongue? You been talking to my wife?
F	MILLS	This is really lame.
M	SOMERSET	Mills...!
F	MILLS	Jesus Christ...
M	MILLS (O.S.)	What kind of gun was it?
M	MILLS (O.S.)	Damn it, Somerset... what kind of gun?! How many bullets?
M	SOMERSET (O.S.)	I don't know. Might've been a revolver.
F	MILLS	Fuck!
M	MILLS (O.S.)	What's he look like?
M	SOMERSET	Brown hat. Tan raincoat... like a... like a trench coat.
F	MILLS	Five... that's five...
F	MILLS	Second floor! Second floor!
F	MILLS	Get down! Move...!
F	MILLS	That's six...
M	SOMERSET	Mills...
M	SOMERSET	Are you alright?
F	MILLS	I'm fine.
M	SOMERSET	What happened?
M	SOMERSET	Mills... ?
M	SOMERSET	Wait... just wait.
F	MILLS	It was him.
M	SOMERSET	You can't go in there.
F	MILLS	The hell I can't! We get in there and we can stop him.
M	SOMERSET	We need a warrant.
F	MILLS	We have probable cause now.
M	SOMERSET	Think about it...
F	MILLS	What the fuck is wrong with you?
M	SOMERSET	Think about how we got here!
M	SOMERSET	We can't tell anyone about this. We can't tell them about the Bureau, so we have no reason for being here.
F	MILLS	By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
M	SOMERSET	Think it through. If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute. He'll walk. We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
F	MILLS	Okay... okay... get off.
M	SOMERSET	You stupid son of a...
F	MILLS	No point in arguing anymore...
F	MILLS	Unless you can fix that.
F	MILLS	How much money do we have left?
M	THIN VAGRANT	So, I... I noticed this guy going out... going out a lot when those murders were happening. So... so I...
F	MILLS	So, you called Detective Somerset, right?
M	THIN VAGRANT	Yeah, I... I called the detective. Because, because this guy seemed... creepy. And... and...
F	MILLS	And...
M	THIN VAGRANT	And, one of the murders was over there... over... nearby here. I... I called the cops...
F	MILLS	I told you the rest. You got it?
M	POLICEMAN	Yeah, whatever.
M	SOMERSET	Have him sign it.
F	MILLS	Great. Is that it?
F	MILLS	Go drink yourself happy.
M	SOMERSET	Wait outside.
M	SOMERSET	Victor.
M	SOMERSET	Jesus.
M	MILLS (O.S.)	Somerset!
M	MILLS (O.S.)	Somerset... come here!
M	MILLS (O.S.)	We had him, damn it.
M	SOMERSET	What are you talking about?
F	MILLS	We had him.
F	MILLS	The pass was a fake.
F	MILLS	We had him and we let him go.
M	SKETCH ARTIST	You're sure this is him?
F	MILLS	Just put it in circulation.
M	SKETCH ARTIST	You got it. Tomorrow morning, this city's good citizens will be on the lookout for Elmer Fudd.
F	SARA	We can't find anything to hang on to. No paystubs, no appointment books or calendars. Not even an address book. And, you're not going to believe this...
F	MILLS	Keep looking.
F	SARA	It's just... we haven't found any fingerprints yet. Not a single one.
F	MILLS	You know, you're right, I don't believe you. Keep looking.
M	SOMERSET	We could use about fifty more men here.
F	MILLS	I'm trying, alright? Just tell me what we've got.
M	SOMERSET	Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
F	MILLS	Then, he must write about these murders.
M	SOMERSET	"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world. Not knowing that we are nothing. We are not what was intended."
M	SOMERSET	"On the subway today, a man came to me to start a conversation. He made small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and other things. I tried to be pleasant and accommodating, but my head began to hurt from his banality. I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him. He was not pleased, and I couldn't help laughing."
M	SOMERSET	No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order. It's just his mind poured out on paper. I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
F	MILLS	Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
F	MILLS	Here...
F	MILLS	Hello.
M	JOHN DOE (V.O.)	I admire you. I don't know how you found me, but imagine my surprise. I respect you detectives more every day.
F	MILLS	Okay, John, let's...
M	JOHN DOE (V.O.)	No, no, no! You listen. I'll be back on schedule tomorrow, even with this setback. I just had to call and express my admiration. I'm sorry I had to hurt you today, but I didn't have a choice. You will accept my apology, won't you? I feel like saying more... but I don't want to ruin the surprise.
F	MILLS	You were right.
F	MILLS	He's preaching.
M	SOMERSET	These murders are his masterwork. His sermon to all of us. To all us sinners.
M	CAPTAIN	It's been a long day, kids. Go home. Just make sure you sleep with the phone between your legs.
M	SOMERSET	Hello.
M	TRACY (V.O.)	Hello, William? It's Tracy.
M	SOMERSET	Tracy, is everything alright?
M	TRACY (V.O.)	Yes, yes, everything's fine.
M	SOMERSET	Where's David?
M	TRACY (V.O.)	He's in the shower, in the other room. I'm sorry to call like this.
M	SOMERSET	It's alright, I guess. I, um... I need to talk to you. I need to talk to someone. Can you meet me somewhere... maybe tomorrow morning?
M	SOMERSET	I really don't understand.
M	TRACY (V.O.)	I feel stupid, but you're the only person I know here. There's no one else...
M	SOMERSET	I just... Can't you get away, for a little while?
M	SOMERSET	I don't know, with this case.
F	TRACY	If you can, please call me. Please. I have to go now... goodnight.
F	TRACY	I mean, you known this city. You've been here for so long.
M	SOMERSET	It's a hard place.
F	TRACY	I don't sleep very well.
M	SOMERSET	I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
F	TRACY	I'm sorry, I only...
F	TRACY	Perfect example.
M	SOMERSET	You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
F	TRACY	I don't know why I asked you to come.
M	SOMERSET	Talk to him about it. He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
F	TRACY	I can't be a burden, especially now. I know I'll get used to things. I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks. Upstate, it was a completely different environment. I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
M	SOMERSET	He mentioned it.
F	TRACY	I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
M	SOMERSET	You should look into private schools.
F	TRACY	I don't know...
M	SOMERSET	What's really bothering you?
F	TRACY	David and I are... going to have a baby.
M	SOMERSET	Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
F	TRACY	I hate this city.
M	SOMERSET	If you're thinking... I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage. And, she was going to have our child. This is a long time ago. She and I had decided we were going to make the choice together... whether to keep the baby.
M	SOMERSET	Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me. I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this? How can a child grow up here? So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong. I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
F	TRACY	I want to have children. It's just...
M	SOMERSET	I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision. I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
M	SOMERSET	If you... don't keep the baby, if that's what you decide, then, never tell him you were pregnant. I mean that. Never. The relationship will whither and die.
M	SOMERSET	But, if you do decide to have the baby, then, at that very moment, when you're absolutely sure, tell David. Tell him at that exact second, and then spoil that kid every chance you get.
M	SOMERSET	That's all the advice I can give you, Tracy. I don't even know you.
F	TRACY	William...
F	TRACY	Thank you.
F	TRACY	Keep in touch after you're gone, William. Please.
M	WILD BILL	Yeah, he picked it up last night.
F	MILLS	This was definitely him?
M	WILD BILL	Yeah, John Doe. Easy name to remember.
M	SOMERSET	What was this job you did for him?
M	WILD BILL	I got a picture of it here. It's a real sweet piece...
M	WILD BILL	I figured he must be one of those performance artists. That's what I figured. Like one of those guys who pisses in a cup on stage and drinks it. Performance art.
F	MILLS	Oh... give me a break.
M	WILD BILL	I think I undercharged him.
M	SOMERSET	You built this for him? You build this?
M	WILD BILL	I've built weirder shit than that. So what?
M	POLICEMAN	Detectives... we have a situation.
M	WILD BILL	Hey, my picture...!
M	WILD BILL	Fucking pigs.
M	BALD MAN	Just wait! Just wait!
M	COP	Get out of the fucking booth!
M	BALD MAN	Just wait! I'll come out, just wait!
M	THIRD COP	I don't want to go in there again.
M	CRAZED MAN	He... he... he made me do it!
M	SECOND ATTENDANT	I have to look at you. I have to look at you!
M	FIRST ATTENDANT	You're not going to want to see this more than once.
M	CRAZED MAN	He had a gun! He made me do it!
M	SECOND ATTENDANT	He's in shock, man. He's gone.
M	CRAZED MAN	Take this thing off me... take it off! Please, take this thing off me!
M	CRAZED MAN	Get it off... oh, God!
M	SWEATING COP	You're the detectives, right? Right? Well, you'd better see this!
M	SWEATING COP	Hey... you better see what's strapped onto this guy!
F	MILLS	We've already seen it!
M	CRAZED MAN	And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married. And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
M	SOMERSET	Where was the girl?
M	CRAZED MAN	What? What?
M	SOMERSET	Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
M	CRAZED MAN	She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.
M	SOMERSET	Who tied her down? You or him?
M	CRAZED MAN	He had a gun. He had a gun... and he made it happen. He made me do it! He made me put that... that thing on. Oh, Christ! He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her. He had the gun in my mouth.
M	CRAZED MAN	The gun was in my throat!
F	MILLS	You didn't hear any screams? Nothing? You didn't notice when this man walked in with a package under his arm?!
M	BALD MAN	No, I didn't.
F	MILLS	You didn't notice anything wrong? Nothing seemed strange to you?
M	BALD MAN	Everybody who goes in there has a package under his arm. Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff. And, screams? There're screams coming out of there everyday. It goes with the territory, little boy!
F	MILLS	You like what you do for a living? You like the things you see?
M	BALD MAN	No. No, I don't. But, that's life.
M	1 gluttony (x) 5 wrath	2 greed (x) 6 pride 4 envy
M	SOMERSET	The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories. Murders in the Rue Morgue. Le Fanu's Green Tea. My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
F	MILLS	Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
M	SOMERSET	One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald. It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction. And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
M	SOMERSET	You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this. It's not possible anymore.
F	MILLS	If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
M	SOMERSET	No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
F	MILLS	How can you say that? Especially after today?
M	SOMERSET	Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind. There's no winning and losing here.
F	MILLS	You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
M	SOMERSET	You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children. You put the killer in jail. Who won?
F	MILLS	You do your job...
M	SOMERSET	Where's the victory?
F	MILLS	You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
M	SOMERSET	Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction. If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil. It's just a man.
F	MILLS	Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
F	MILLS	You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead? You think you're toughening me up? Well, you're not! You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
M	SOMERSET	People don't want a champion. They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
F	MILLS	What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt you out?
M	SOMERSET	It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean. I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
F	MILLS	Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right? No one's worthy of you.
M	SOMERSET	Wrong! I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe. It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love. You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad. Keep ignoring.
F	MILLS	You're talking about people who are mentally ill. You're...
M	SOMERSET	No I'm not! I'm talking about common, everyday life here. If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
F	MILLS	Listen to yourself. You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people." But, you're already here. You've been here a long time. So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
M	SOMERSET	That part of me is dead.
F	MILLS	You want me to agree with you: "Yeah, you're right, Somerset. This is a fucked place. Let's go live in a fucking log cabin." Well, I don't agree with you. You're giving up, and it makes me sick, because you're the best I've ever seen.
F	MILLS	Thanks for the beer.
F	TRACY	Honey?
F	MILLS	I love you.
M	JOHN DOE (V.O.)	I've gone and done it again.
M	GIL	He really did a number on her, didn't he?
M	SOMERSET	Sleeping pills.
M	SOMERSET	You see what he did?
F	MILLS	He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
M	SOMERSET	Call for help, and you'll live. But, you'll be disfigured. Or, put yourself out of your misery.
M	O'NEILL	He cut off her nose to spite her face, and he did it very recently.
M	SOMERSET	I've decided to stay on this, till it's over. Till it's either done or we can both see it's never going to finish.
F	MILLS	Oh, you want to stay now?
M	SOMERSET	One of two things will happen. We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
F	MILLS	You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
M	SOMERSET	I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me the favor.
F	MILLS	You knew I'd say yes.
M	SOMERSET	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
M	SOMERSET	As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
F	MILLS	Big surprise.
F	MILLS	Mills and Somerset are on the premises.
M	SERGEANT	Wonder-fucking-ful.
M	PLAIN CLOTHES COP	Your wife called this morning. Do us a favor and get yourself an answering machine, how bout it?
M	JOHN DOE (O.S.)	Detective.
M	JOHN DOE (O.S.)	Detective!
M	JOHN DOE	I know you.
M	UNIFORMED COP	It's him!
F	MILLS	Get down. Get down on the floor.
M	ANOTHER COP	You heard him, fuckface. Get down!
M	SOMERSET	Be careful!
F	MILLS	Down! Face on the floor!
M	ONE COP	Spread your legs and get your hands out in front of you!
F	MILLS	Don't move. Don't move an inch.
M	SOMERSET	I don't believe it.
M	JOHN DOE	Hello.
M	COP	What the fuck is this...?
M	JOHN DOE	I want to speak to my lawyer.
M	CAPTAIN	He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment. He's been doing it for quite a while. Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
F	MILLS	What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.
M	CAPTAIN	So far it's all dead ends. No credit history. No employment history. His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash. We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.
M	SOMERSET	Because he is John Doe, by choice.
F	MILLS	When do we get to question him?
M	CAPTAIN	You don't. It goes to court now.
F	MILLS	He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.
M	CAPTAIN	Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.
M	SOMERSET	He's not finished.
F	MILLS	He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
M	CAPTAIN	You're wound too tight, Mills. Let it go.
F	MILLS	You know he's fucking us.
M	SOMERSET	You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop.
F	MILLS	Well... what the fuck, man?
M	SOMERSET	He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right? Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next? I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
F	MILLS	No.
M	SOMERSET	I can tell you this. I recognize his lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.
M	SOMERSET	He's the one who got Victor out. We'll wait for John Doe's plea.
M	1 gluttony (x) 5 wrath	4 envy
M	SWARR	My client says there are two more bodies... two more victims, hidden away. He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies, but only Detectives Mills and Somerset. Only at six o'clock today.
M	TALBOT	Oh, Christ.
F	MILLS	Why us?
M	SWARR	He says he admires you.
M	SOMERSET	This is all part of his game plan.
M	SWARR	My client claims that if the detectives do not accept this offer, these two bodies will never be found.
M	CAPTAIN	Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let them rot.
M	TALBOT	We don't make deals, Mr. Swarr.
F	MILLS	How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
M	CAPTAIN	Ease back, Mills.
M	SWARR	I'm required by law to serve my clients to the best of my ability, and to serve their best interests.
M	CAPTAIN	Well, we're going to have to pass.
M	SWARR	My client... he also wishes to inform you, if you do not accept, he will plead insanity, across the board.
M	TALBOT	Let him try! I'd like to see him try!
M	SWARR	Come now, Martin. We all know, with the extreme nature of these crimes, I could get him off with such a plea.
M	TALBOT	I'm not letting this conviction slide, I can tell you that right here and right now!
M	SWARR	He says, if you accept, under his specific conditions, he will sign a full confession and plead guilty... right here, right now.
M	CAPTAIN	What do you think?
F	MILLS	I'm in. It has to be both of you.
M	SOMERSET	If he were to claim insanity, this conversation is admissible. The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea...
M	SWARR	And, my client reminds you, two more are dead. The press would have a field day if they found out the police didn't seem too concerned about finding them... giving them a proper burial.
M	SOMERSET	If there really are two more dead.
M	CAPTAIN	The lab report came up from downtown, They did a quickie on Doe's clothing and fingernails. They found blood from Doe, from him cutting his own fingers... there was blood from the woman whose face he cut off, and blood from a third party. As yet unidentified.
M	TALBOT	You would be escorting an unarmed man.
F	MILLS	Let's finish it.
M	SOMERSET	Well... get the fucking lawyer out of the room and we can talk about how this whole thing's going to go down.
M	SOMERSET	If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
F	MILLS	I will.
F	MILLS	If I were to accidentally cut off one of my nipple, would that be covered by workman's compensation?
M	SOMERSET	I suppose so. If you were man enough to actually file the claim, I'd buy you a new one out of my own pocket.
F	MILLS	Listen, Somerset... I uh...
M	SOMERSET	What is it?
F	MILLS	Well, I have to tell you... I think I've fallen in love with you.
M	SOMERSET	Slut.
F	MILLS	Kiss me on the lips.
M	SOMERSET	Give me a break.
M	SOMERSET	Stay as cold as ice.
M	CALIFORNIA	Is this wind going to hurt us?
M	PILOT	Just makes the ride more fun.
M	SOMERSET	Who are you, John? Who are you really?
M	JOHN DOE	What do you mean?
M	SOMERSET	I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
M	JOHN DOE	It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
F	MILLS	Where we headed?
M	JOHN DOE	You'll see.
F	MILLS	We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny? That wouldn't be... shocking enough. Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
M	JOHN DOE	Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
F	MILLS	What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
M	JOHN DOE	Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though. What I'm doing.
F	MILLS	I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
M	JOHN DOE	You know that's not true.
F	MILLS	In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
M	JOHN DOE	You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet. Not yet. But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
F	MILLS	Spit it out.
M	JOHN DOE	It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
M	JOHN DOE	I can't wait for you to see. I can't wait... It's really going to be something.
F	MILLS	Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn't want to miss it.
M	JOHN DOE	Oh, don't worry. You won't...
M	JOHN DOE (V.O.)	...you won't miss a thing.
M	CALIFORNIA	Head over the bridge and keep them in sight. Just keep your distance.
M	SOMERSET	What's so exciting?
M	JOHN DOE	It's not too far away now.
M	JOHN DOE	I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows. Isn't that true? How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
F	MILLS	Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny. I like you. I like you a lot.
M	JOHN DOE	You wouldn't because you know there are consequences. It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner. I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
F	MILLS	You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off. That's all.
M	JOHN DOE	Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed. An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you. Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. After him I picked the lawyer. And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one. This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
F	MILLS	Murderers?
M	JOHN DOE	A woman...
F	MILLS	Murderers like you?
M	JOHN DOE	A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually. And, don't forget the disease spreading whore. Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. That's the point. You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally. And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night. Not anymore. I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
F	MILLS	Delusions of grandeur.
M	JOHN DOE	You should be thanking me.
F	MILLS	And, why is that?
M	JOHN DOE	You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me. And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
F	MILLS	We would have gotten you eventually.
M	JOHN DOE	Really? Just biding your time, then? Toying with me. Is that it? Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
M	JOHN DOE	Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
F	MILLS	I seem to remember knocking on your door.
M	JOHN DOE	And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
F	MILLS	Sit back.
M	JOHN DOE	I spared you, and you're going to have to remember that every time you look in the mirror at that nose on your face for the rest of your life. Or, I should say, for the rest of what life I've allowed you to have.
F	MILLS	I said, sit back, freak. Sit back and shut your fucking mouth!
M	JOHN DOE	Don't ask me to pity the people I killed. I don't mourn them anymore than I mourn the thousands who died in Sodom and Gomorrah.
F	MILLS	You fuck. You really think what you did was God's good work?
M	JOHN DOE	The Lord works in mysterious ways.
M	CALIFORNIA	There ain't no ambush out here. There ain't no fucking nothing out here.
M	PILOT (V.O.)	We got about two minutes before they come up behind us.
M	CALIFORNIA	Go high. Way up. In sixty seconds, cut to the west.
M	JOHN DOE	I didn't do that.
F	MILLS	What are you looking for?
M	JOHN DOE	What time is it?
M	SOMERSET	Why?
M	JOHN DOE	I want to know.
F	MILLS	Just keep leading the way.
M	JOHN DOE	It's close.
M	SOMERSET	Mills!
M	SOMERSET	Stay with him.
F	MILLS	Wait!
M	SOMERSET	There's no time to discuss it!
M	JOHN DOE	There he goes.
M	SOMERSET	There's a van... coming down the industrial road. Coming from the east.
M	SOMERSET (V.O.)	The van is coming from the east. I don't know what it is. Come around. Come around.
M	SOMERSET	Just get ready for anything and wait for my signal. Wait for me.
M	JOHN DOE	It's good we have some time to talk.
F	MILLS	Get down. Get down on your knees!
M	SOMERSET	Stop the van! Stop!
M	SOMERSET	Get out! Get out with your hands on your head! Do it now!
M	DELIVERYMAN	Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
M	SOMERSET	Turn around. Hands on your head!
M	DELIVERYMAN	What the hell's going on?
M	SOMERSET	Who are you? What are you doing out here?
M	DELIVERYMAN	I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
M	DELIVERYMAN (V.O.)	It's just a package for this guy... David. Detective David Mills.
M	CALIFORNIA	Motherfucker.
M	PILOT	Let's do it.
M	CALIFORNIA	No! Wait for Somerset!
M	JOHN DOE	When I said I admired you... I meant what I said. I do admire you.
F	MILLS	Shut up.
M	DELIVERYMAN	This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here. He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
M	SOMERSET	Put it down. Put it on the ground.
M	DELIVERYMAN	Okay...
M	SOMERSET	Go. Get out of here!
M	SOMERSET	There's a package here. It's from John Doe.
M	SOMERSET	I don't know... I don't know...
M	SOMERSET (.O.)	I'm going to have to open it.
M	JOHN DOE	I wish I could have been a normal man like you. I wish I could have a simple life.
F	MILLS	What the fuck is going on here?!
M	PILOT	Let's go!
M	CALIFORNIA	We are going to wait!
M	SOMERSET (V.O.)	Oh, Christ... oh Christ...
M	SOMERSET	No...
F	MILLS	Get up. Stand up! Let's go!
M	JOHN DOE	You've made a good life for yourself...
F	MILLS	Shut up!
M	SOMERSET	Oh, fuck, no...
M	SOMERSET	Listen... listen to me. Whatever you do... don't come in here. Stay away. No matter what you hear, do not move in! John Doe has the upper hand.
M	JOHN DOE	Here he comes.
F	MILLS	What the fuck is going on?
M	JOHN DOE	I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
M	SOMERSET	Mills... put down your gun! Throw it away!
F	MILLS	What?
M	SOMERSET	Throw your gun down now!
F	MILLS	What are you talking about? What happened?
M	JOHN DOE	Are you listening to me, Detective Mills? I'm trying to tell you how much I admire you... and your pretty wife Tracy.
M	SOMERSET	Throw your weapon, detective! Now!
F	MILLS	What did you say?
M	JOHN DOE	It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
M	SOMERSET	David... please...
M	JOHN DOE	I visited your home this morning, after you left.
M	JOHN DOE	I tried to play husband... tried to taste the life of a simple man, but it didn't work out. So, I took a souvenir.
M	SOMERSET	Give me the gun.
M	JOHN DOE	Her pretty head.
F	MILLS	Somerset...
M	JOHN DOE	Because I envy your normal life. Envy is my sin.
M	SOMERSET	No!
F	MILLS	Tell me it's not true.
M	SOMERSET	I can't let you do this...
F	MILLS	Put your gun down!!
M	SOMERSET	Don't do this... please...
F	MILLS	Put the gun down, Somerset!
M	SOMERSET	David, listen to me...
M	SOMERSET	He wants this! He wants you to do it!
M	JOHN DOE	Kill me.
F	MILLS	Stop it! You stay away!
M	SOMERSET	I can't let you do this!
M	JOHN DOE	She begged for her life, and for the life of your baby inside her.
M	JOHN DOE	You didn't know.
M	SOMERSET	NO!
M	CAPTAIN (O.S.)	Hey there, Somerset.
M	SOMERSET	Hello.
M	CAPTAIN	How you feeling?
M	SOMERSET	I can breathe without pain now, so I guess I feel great.
M	CAPTAIN	The guys at the precinct heard you're getting out today. Anyway, we all chipped in...
M	SOMERSET	Thank you. Tell them, thank you.
M	CAPTAIN	We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
M	SOMERSET	Yeah, that's true.
M	CAPTAIN	They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
M	SOMERSET	It would be too hard.
M	CAPTAIN	I have to get going, but... there is one more thing.
M	CAPTAIN	I don't know if you're going to want it. It was down front. It's from Mills.
M	CAPTAIN	He's being arraigned tomorrow.
M	SOMERSET	I read about it in the paper.
M	CAPTAIN	I guess... decide for yourself. I don't know what it says. I'm going to go.
M	SOMERSET	I'll see you.
M	NURSE	There you go, Mister Somerset.
M	NURSE	Yes?
M	SOMERSET	Nothing.
M	SOMERSET	Oh... man...
M	THE END
