M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, are we all here? Good. As you know, my plot to high- jack nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage has failed. Again. This organization will not tolerate failure.
M	DR. EVIL	Mustafa...
M	DR. EVIL	Frau Farbissina...
M	DR. EVIL	I spared your lives because I need you to help me rid the world of the only man who can stop me now. We must go to London. I've set a trap for Austin Powers!
M	AUSTIN	Alright, luv! Love it! Turn... pout for me baby. Smashing!
M	AUSTIN	Crazy baby. Give me some shoulder. Yes! Yes! Yes! No. No. Show me love. Yes! And... done. Here you go, luv. I'm spent.
M	AUSTIN	Get these off to Fab Magazine right away.
M	SUPERMODEL 1	Austin, you've really outdone yourself this time.
M	AUSTIN	Thanks, baby.
M	SUPERMODEL 2	We could have another photo session back at my flat.
M	AUSTIN	Oh, behave!
M	SUPERMODEL 3	Austin, I love you!
M	AUSTIN	So many women, so little time.
M	MOD GIRL 1	It's Austin Powers!
M	AUSTIN	Judo chop! Judo chop!
M	AUSTIN	You might want to protest a bit louder next time, luv.
M	AUSTIN	Hello, Mrs. Kensington.
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	Hello, Austin
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
M	AUSTIN	We know all that, Exposition.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
M	AUSTIN	Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
M	AUSTIN	Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Good luck, Austin.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
M	AUSTIN	Yes?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you. Let's go, baby!
M	MICK JAGGER	Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
M	AUSTIN	Hey, Mick!
M	MICK JAGGER	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
M	AUSTIN	Well, you can't always get what you want.
M	MICK JAGGER	"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
M	AUSTIN	Good on ya, man.
M	MICK JAGGER	Groovy!
M	ANDY WARHOL	Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
M	AUSTIN	Hey, how are you?
M	ANDY WARHOL	Hungry.
M	AUSTIN	Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
M	ANDY WARHOL	I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
M	AUSTIN	If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
M	ANDY WARHOL	"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
M	AUSTIN	Smashing!
M	QUEEN	Austin Powers, Britain owes you a debt of gratitude.
M	QUEEN	I understand you were wounded. Where were you hit?
M	AUSTIN	In the but-tocks.
M	QUEEN	That must be a sight. I'd kind of like to see that.
M	QUEEN	Nice buttocks.
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	We've got to find Dr. Evil!
M	AUSTIN	Wait, I've got an idea.
M	EVERYONE	Ohhh!
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	Austin, why in God's name did you strike that woman?
M	AUSTIN	That ain't no woman! It's a man, man. It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins.
M	AUSTIN	Where's Doctor Evil?
M	AUSTIN	I've got you again, Dr. Evil!
M	DR. EVIL	Not this time. Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! See you in the future, Mr. Powers!
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	My God! He's freezing himself.
M	DR. EVIL (V.O.)	I'll be back, Mr. Powers, when free love is dead, and greed and avarice once again rule the world.
M	RADAR OPERATOR	Commander Gilmour?
M	RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Is it one of ours?
M	RADAR OPERATOR	No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite. It does have an odd shape, sir.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	What are you saying, son?
M	RADAR OPERATOR	It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Oh my God, he's back.
M	RADAR OPERATOR	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Shut up.
M	RADAR OPERATOR	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	What's its current position?
M	RADAR SCREEN	It was over Nevada, but... oh my God! It's gone!
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Listen son, I want you to forget what you saw here tonight.
M	RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, I have to log it...
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Philips.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Call the President
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Prepare the jet...
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Get my overnight bag.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Philips, do me a favor and feed my fish.
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Not too much!
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	I'm going to London, England.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had himself frozen in 1967. Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to have himself frozen, in the event Dr. Evil should ever return. We believe Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world. And that, gentlemen, is why we're here.
M	COMMAND GILMOUR	Outstanding re-cap, Exposition.
M	BORSCHEVSKY	Who is this Austin Powers? Is he a British operative?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	No, he worked freelance, an internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate gentlemen spy by night.
M	FEMALE ANNOUNCER	Attention, Stage One, laser cutting beginning.
M	FEMALE ANNOUNCER	Laser cutting complete. Stage Two, warm liquid goo phase beginning.
M	FEMALE ANNOUNCER	Warm liquid goo phases complete. Stage Three, reanimation beginning.
M	FEMALE ANNOUNCER	Reanimation complete. Stage Four, cleansing beginning.
M	FEMALE ANNOUNCER	Cleansing complete. Stage Five, evacuation beginning. Evacuation com...
M	FEMALE ANNOUNCER	Evacuation... Complete! The cryogenic state of Austin Powers is now completed.
M	AUSTIN	Where am I?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
M	AUSTIN	WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
M	AUSTIN	Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
M	AUSTIN	Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
M	AUSTIN	Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	We won, Austin.
M	AUSTIN	Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
M	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Mr. Powers, the President's very concerned. We've got a madman on the loose in Nevada.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	It's Dr. Evil.
M	AUSTIN	When do I begin?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
M	AUSTIN	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Vanessa's one of our top agents.
M	AUSTIN	My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
F	VANESSA	Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
M	AUSTIN	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
F	VANESSA	My mother's told me all about you.
M	AUSTIN	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
F	VANESSA	My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
M	AUSTIN	Yes?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
M	AUSTIN	Thanks.
F	VANESSA	Let's gather your personal effects, shall we?
M	CLERK	Danger Powers, personal effects.
M	AUSTIN	Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
M	CLERK	It says here, name Danger Powers.
M	AUSTIN	Danger's my middle name.
M	CLERK	OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
M	AUSTIN	That's not mine.
M	CLERK	One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
M	AUSTIN	I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
M	CLERK	One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
M	AUSTIN	I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
M	CLERK	One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
M	AUSTIN	OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
F	VANESSA	Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
M	AUSTIN	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
M	AUSTIN	Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
F	VANESSA	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
M	AUSTIN	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
F	VANESSA	I beg your pardon?
M	AUSTIN	I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
F	VANESSA	Excuse me?
M	AUSTIN	My wedding tackle.
F	VANESSA	I'm sorry?
M	AUSTIN	My meat and two veg.
F	VANESSA	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
M	AUSTIN	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
F	VANESSA	A Chigro?
M	AUSTIN	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.
F	VANESSA	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
M	AUSTIN	That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much.
M	AUSTIN	Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	My name is Mrs. Wilkenson. There are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we're not wearing these.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Also, I have some questions about the itinerary. It says here, '4:30 - Dinner, 5:30 - Everyone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'?
M	AUSTIN	Seems pretty straightforward, don't you think...listen darling, I think you're a fabulous bird. Can I get your telephone number?
M	FLGHT ATTENDANT	Sure, it's easy to remember. It's 777-FILM. We have to prepare the craft for take-off now.
M	AUSTIN	Smashing! When we land I'll give you a tinkle on the telling bone.
M	AUSTIN	Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
F	VANESSA	Sure.
M	AUSTIN	Do I make you horny?
F	VANESSA	What?
M	AUSTIN	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
F	VANESSA	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
M	AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
F	VANESSA	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
M	AUSTIN	What's you point, Vanessa?
M	COMPUTER VOICE	You've got mail!
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look. Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
M	AUSTIN	Yes?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
M	PILOT	Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our final descent into Las Vegas International Airport. Flight attendants will be coming by to collect your drinks, and I'll ask you at this time to please return to the main cabin and put your bean- bags in the upright position.
M	DR. EVIL	Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a long time, but I'm back. It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw. Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen. I was therefore by definition only partially frozen.
M	MUSTAFA	But my design was perfect! Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
M	DR. EVIL	Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
M	MUSTAFA	But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is-- --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
M	DR. EVIL	And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
M	MUSTAFA	We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
M	DR. EVIL	Silence!
M	MUSTAFA	Ahhhhhhhhh!
M	DR. EVIL	Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, let's get down to business.
M	DR. EVIL	We've got a lot of work to do.
M	MUSTAFA (O.S.)	Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
M	DR. EVIL	Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
M	MUSTAFA (O.S.)	Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
M	DR. EVIL	You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
M	MUSTAFA (O.S.)	If somebody can open the retrieval hatch down here, I could get out. See, I designed this device myself and...oh, hi! Good, I'm glad you found me. Listen, I'm very badly burned, so if you could just--
M	MUSTAFA (O.S.)	Ow! You shot me!
M	DR. EVIL	Right. Okay. Moving on. You shot me right in the arm! Why did--
M	DR. EVIL	Let me go around the table and introduce everyone. Frau Farbissina...
M	DR. EVIL	...founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army. Random Task...
M	DR. EVIL	...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire. Show them what you do.
M	DR. EVIL	Thank you, Random Task. Patty O'Brien...
M	DR. EVIL	...ex-Irish assassin. His trademark?
M	DR. EVIL	A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills. Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence.
M	PATTY O'BRIEN	Yes, they're always after me lucky charms!
M	PATTY O'BRIEN	What? What? Why does everyone always laugh when I say that? They are after me lucky charms.
M	PATTY O'BRIEN	What?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	It's a television commercial with this little cartoon Leprechaun who is a benevolent imp who is very concerned that these children will steal his lucky charms which are foodstuffs fashioned into various shapes-- hearts, moons, clovers, what have you... It's a long story.
M	DR. EVIL	Finally, I come to my number two man. His name: Number Two.
M	DR. EVIL	For thirty years, Number Two has run Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.
M	NUMBER TWO	Over the last thirty years, Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds. About fifteen years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals to the communication industry. We own cable companies in thirty-eight states.
M	NUMBER TWO	In addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland.
M	NUMBER TWO	Shipping in Texas.
M	NUMBER TWO	Oil refineries in Seattle.
M	NUMBER TWO	And a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.
M	NUMBER TWO	We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
M	NUMBER TWO	Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
M	DR. EVIL	People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser." Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
M	NUMBER TWO	Umm, that also has already happened.
M	DR. EVIL	Right. Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom... ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
M	NUMBER TWO	Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
M	DR. EVIL	All right then... ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
M	NUMBER TWO	Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
M	DR. EVIL	Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars. OK, make it happen. Anything else?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
M	DR. EVIL	Yes.
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
M	DR. EVIL	My son?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Yes. Scott!
M	SCOTT EVIL	Hi.
M	DR. EVIL	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil. I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
M	SCOTT EVIL	I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
M	AUSTIN	You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
F	VANESSA	Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
M	AUSTIN	Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
F	VANESSA	No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
M	AUSTIN	Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
M	AUSITN	Which side of the bed do you want?
F	VANESSA	You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation.
M	AUSTIN	So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later? How do you like to do it? Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails? A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father.
M	AUSTIN	I'm just joking, Vanessa. Trying to get a rise out of you.
F	VANESSA	Let's unpack.
M	AUSTIN	Gor blimey, nerd alert.
M	AUSTIN	Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine.
F	VANESSA	I'm sure.
M	AUSTIN	I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
M	MOVIE PHONE VOICE	Hello! And welcome to 777-FILM!
M	AUSTIN	I got her answering machine.
M	AUSTIN	I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
F	VANESSA	Here, use mine.
M	AUSTIN	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
M	AUSTIN	Do you mind if I join you?
M	NUMBER TWO	Not at all.
M	DEALER	Seventeen.
M	NUMBER TWO	Hit me.
M	DEALER	You have seventeen, sir. The book says not to, sir.
M	NUMBER TWO	I like to live dangerously.
M	DEALER	Four. Twenty-one.
M	DEALER	Eighteen. Sixteen.
M	NUMBER TWO	I'll stay.
M	DEALER	Sir?
M	DEALER	Sir?
F	VANESSA	What's wrong?
M	AUSTIN	I can't see a bloody thing.
F	VANESSA	Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
M	DEALER	Sir, the table is waiting.
M	AUSTIN	Uh, hit me.
M	DEALER	On an eighteen, sir?
M	AUSTIN	Yes, I also like to live dangerously.
M	NUMBER TWO	You're very brave.
M	AUSTIN	Cards are not my bag, man. Allow myself to introduce... myself. My name is Ritchie Cunningham.
M	AUSTIN	This is my wife, Enid.
M	NUMBER TWO	My name is Number Two.
F	VANESSA	Number Two? That's an unusual name.
M	NUMBER TWO	My parents were hippies. This is my Italian confidential secretary.
M	ITALIAN WOMAN	My name is Alotta Alotta Fagina.
M	AUSTIN	I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounds like you're saying your name is a lot of... never mind. Listen, cats, I'm going to crash. It's been a gas.
M	NUMBER TWO	Bye-bye, Mr... Cunningham?
M	AUSTIN	Peace, baby.
F	VANESSA	Why did you leave so soon?
M	AUSTIN	That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
M	TEXAN	Good luck, buddy. You don't buy food, you rent it.
M	AUSTIN	Too right, youth.
M	AUSTIN	Uh, uh!
M	TEXAN	Hey pardner, just relax, don't force it! Use some creative visualization.
M	PATTY O'BRIEN	Ughhhhh...
M	AUSTIN	Who does Number Two work for?
M	TEXAN	That's right! Show that turd who's boss!
M	AUSTIN	Who does Number Two work for?
M	PATTY O'BRIEN	Go to hell.
M	TEXAN	Jesus Christ, what did you eat?
F	VANESSA	Hello Mum?
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight? Great.
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	How's Austin?
M	VANESSA (V.O.)	He's asleep.
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	You didn't...
F	VANESSA	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
M	MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)	I'm proud of you.
F	VANESSA	Why?
M	MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)	Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
F	VANESSA	Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
M	MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)	You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
F	VANESSA	What about his teeth?
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
F	VANESSA	I just don't see it.
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
F	VANESSA	Did you ever...
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	Of course not. I was married to your father.
F	VANESSA	Did you ever want to?
F	MRS. KENSINGTON	Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
F	VANESSA	You didn't answer my question, Mum.
M	MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)	I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
M	AUSTIN (V.O.)	Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
F	VANESSA	Do you want to talk to him? No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
F	VANESSA	I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
M	MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)	I love you, Vanessa.
M	AUSTIN	Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
F	VANESSA	Why?
M	AUSTIN	We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
F	VANESSA	A limousine has just pulled up.
M	AUSTIN	Let me see.
M	AUSTIN	Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
F	VANESSA	How do you know?
M	AUSTIN	I never forget a pussy... cat.
F	VANESSA	Let's go get him!
M	AUSTIN	He's too well-protected right now.
F	VANESSA	We can't just sit here, Austin.
M	AUSTIN	Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
F	VANESSA	I don't get it.
M	AUSTIN	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
F	VANESSA	Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
M	AUSTIN	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
M	AUSTIN	My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly beautiful. Stay right where you are.
F	VANESSA	I hate having my picture taken.
M	AUSTIN	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
M	AUSTIN	Go, Vanessa, go!
M	AUSTIN	Alright, luv! Love it! Turn... pout for me Vanessa. Smashing! Crazy. Give me some shoulder. Yes! Yes! Yes!
M	AUSTIN	Show me love. Yes! Smashing!
M	AUSTIN	Great! Great! Smashing! Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! Going in very close now.
M	AUSTIN	Give me eyes. Give me cornea. Give me aqueous humour. Coming in closer. Give me retina, Vanessa. Even closer. Give me optic nerve. Love it! And... done.
M	AUSTIN	I'm spent. What say you we go out on the town?
M	AUSTIN	Fancy a nibble?
F	VANESSA	I couldn't have another bite.
M	VANESSA (O.S.)	Watch out, you're on my hair!
M	AUSTIN (O.S.)	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
M	VANESSA (O.S.)	Go! Just go!
M	AUSTIN (O.S.)	Left hand, blue.
M	AUSTIN	Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby. I know what. I'll take the stairs.
M	AUSTIN	Maybe I'll take the escalator.
M	AUSTIN	Why take the escalator when I could take a canoe?
F	VANESSA	I haven't had fun like that since college.
M	AUSTIN	I'm sorry.
F	VANESSA	Why?
M	AUSTIN	I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
F	VANESSA	Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
M	AUSTIN	No, this is me in a nutshell.
M	AUSTIN	Help! I'm in a nutshell! What kind of nut has such a big nutshell? How did I get into this bloody great big nutshell?
M	AUSTIN	You're smashed, Vanessa.
F	VANESSA	I am not.
M	AUSTIN	Oh, yes you are.
F	VANESSA	I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
M	AUSTIN	I can't. You're drunk.
F	VANESSA	It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
M	AUSTIN	She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
M	AUSTIN	Right away, Exposition.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Where is Vanessa, by the way?
M	AUSTIN	She's working on another lead right now.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you, Basil.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
M	AUSTIN	Yes?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
M	AUSTIN	Oh, yes. Thank you.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	There's one more thing, Austin.
M	AUSTIN	Yes?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you.
M	AUSTIN	Paging Dr. Freud.
M	AUSTIN	Give it to me baby. Super.
M	AUSTIN	Pout for me, luv. Smashing. Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No!
M	AUSTIN	And I'm spent.
M	AUSTIN	You seem surprised to see me.
M	ALOTTA	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
M	AUSTIN	What, and watch all my earnings go... Down the toilet?
M	ALOTTA	What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
M	AUSTIN	Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
M	ALOTTA	You may.
M	AUSTIN	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
M	ALOTTA	Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
M	AUSTIN	I didn't, baby, you just told me.
M	ALOTTA	It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
M	AUSTIN	Behave!
M	ALOTTA	Come in.
M	AUSTIN	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
M	ALOTTA	Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
M	ALOTTA	May I wash you?
M	AUSTIN	Groovy.
M	ALOTTA	In Japan, men come first and women come second.
M	AUSTIN	Or sometimes not at all.
M	ALOTTA	Care for some saki?
M	AUSTIN	Sak-i it to me!
M	ALOTTA	How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
M	AUSTIN	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
M	AUSTIN	'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food. It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
M	ALOTTA	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
M	AUSTIN	'Milk, milk, lemonade. Round the corner fudge is made. Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
M	ALOTTA	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
M	AUSTIN	To my health.
M	ALOTTA	Kiss me.
M	ALOTTA	Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
M	AUSTIN	Is it about my teeth?
M	ALOTTA	Yes.
M	AUSTIN	Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
M	ALOTTA	I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
M	AUSTIN	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
M	ALOTTA	Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
M	DR. EVIL	Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
M	DR. EVIL	Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	These are the latest word in android replicant technology. Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
M	DR. EVIL	Quite impressive.
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
M	DR. EVIL	I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
M	NUMBER TWO	That would be the video feed from Kreplachistan.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, Phase One is complete. The warhead is ours. Let Phase Two begin! Patch us through to the United Nations security secret meeting room.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.
M	DR. EVIL	In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing. Well, it's in safe hands. If you want it back, you'll have to pay me... ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
M	DR. EVIL	Sorry. ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!
M	UNITED NATIONS SECRETATY	Gentlemen, silence! Now, Mr. Evil--
M	DR. EVIL	Doctor Evil! I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'mister'.
M	UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY	Excuse me. Dr. Evil, it is the policy of the United Nations not to negotiate with terrorists.
M	DR. EVIL	Fine, have it your way. Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with one hundred billion dollars. If you fail to do so, we'll set off the warhead and destroy the world.
M	UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY	You can't destroy the world with a single warhead.
M	DR. EVIL	Really? So long.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha.
M	EVIL ASSOCIATES	Ha-ha-ha-ha.
M	DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES	HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! Ohhhh, ahhhhhh... Ohhh, hmmmm. hmn.
M	DR. EVIL	Okay... Well... I think I'm going to watch some TV.
M	EVIL ASSOCIATES	Okay. Sure.
M	AUSTIN	Hello, Exposition.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
M	AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other?
M	AUSTIN	Excuse me?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other thing you're scared of?
M	AUSTIN	Carnies.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	What?
M	AUSTIN	Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
M	AUSTIN	Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
F	VANESSA	When did you find that out, Austin?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin did some reconnaissance work at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last night.
F	VANESSA	Oh. Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon. Any ideas?
F	VANESSA	Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour. I suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level reconnaissance.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Top drawer, Kensington. Oh, Austin, I want you to meet somebody.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. Exposition. She's in from Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	My God, Austin, what have you done?
M	AUSTIN	That's not your mother, that's a man!
M	MRS. EXPOSITION	Owww...my hair!
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Get away from my mother!
F	VANESSA	Austin, have you gone mad?
M	MRS. EXPOSITION	Who is that man? Why did he hit me?
M	BASIL EXPOSIION	Don't worry, mother. Lie down. Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do.
M	AUSTIN	I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
M	AUSTIN	You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
F	VANESSA	Really, Austin!
M	AUSTIN	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	All right, Austin, I think you should go.
M	AUSTIN	I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin?
M	AUSTIN	Yes, Basil?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
M	AUSTIN	Thanks.
F	VANESSA	Austin, may I have a word with you?
M	AUSTIN	Of course, luv.
F	VANESSA	Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
M	AUSTIN	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
F	VANESSA	I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
M	AUSTIN	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
F	VANESSA	No, did you use a condom?
M	AUSTIN	Only sailors use condoms, man.
F	VANESSA	Not in the Nineties.
M	AUSTIN	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.
F	VANESSA	Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
M	AUSTIN	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
F	VANESSA	You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
M	AUSTIN	Hello, luv.
F	VANESSA	Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
M	AUSTIN	Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
F	VANESSA	Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
M	AUSTIN	Out and about, doing odds and sods.
F	VANESSA	I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
M	SON 1	I love you, Dad.
M	DAD 1	I love you, Son.
M	THERAPIST	That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
M	DR. EVIL	Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
M	GROUP	Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.
M	SCOTT EVIL	Hello, everybody.
M	THERAPIST	So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Well, it's kind of weird.
M	THERAPIST	We don't judge here.
M	SCOTT EVIL	OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
M	THERAPIST	And how do you feel about that?
M	SCOTT EVIL	I don't wanna take over the family business.
M	DR. EVIL	But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Not me.
M	THERAPIST	What do you want to do, Scott?
M	SCOTT EVIL	I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
M	DR. EVIL	An evil vet?
M	SCOTT EVIL	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
M	DR. EVIL	An evil petting zoo?
M	SCOTT EVIL	You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
M	THERAPIST	We don't label people here, Scott.
M	SCOTT EVIL	No, he's really evil.
M	THERAPIST	Scott.
M	DR. EVIL	No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
M	THERAPIST	Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
M	SCOTT EVIL	I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
M	THERAPIST	OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
M	DR. EVIL	Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
M	THERAPIST	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
M	DR. EVIL	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
M	THERAPIST	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
M	GROUP	Yes, of course. Go ahead, etc.
M	DR. EVIL	Very well, where should I begin? My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum. At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical school. From there...
M	AUSTIN	Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
F	VANESSA	Do you think she's prettier than I?
M	AUSTIN	Who?
F	VANESSA	You know who.
M	AUSTIN	No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
F	VANESSA	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
M	AUSTTIN	Well put. Listen love, we can't keep having this fight. I'm an International Man of Mystery. Sometimes in the course of my work to save the world I have to shag some crumpet. It's all part of the job.
M	TOUR GUIDE	Welcome to Virtucon, the company of the future. Virtucon is a leading manufacturer of many items you'll find right in your own home. We make steel, volatile chemicals, petroleum-based products, and we also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
M	TOUR GUIDE	Coming up on the left, we have the Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide range of Virtucon licensed products. On the right, you'll notice a door that leads to a restricted area. Only authorized personnel are allowed beyond that point.
M	AUSTIN	I'll take him, you take her.
F	VANESSA	Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
M	AUSTIN	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. Just watch me. Watch me, now.
M	GUARD	Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
M	AUSTIN	Sure.
M	AUSTIN	Everything seems to be in order.
M	GUARD	Hey, wait a minute--
M	GUARD	Everything seems to be in order.
F	VANESSA	That's amazing. Let's go!
M	AUSTIN	Hold on one second.
M	AUSTIN	Here, have a piece of gum.
M	GUARD	Here, have a piece of gum.
M	AUSTIN	Don't mind if I do.
M	GUARD	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
M	AUSTIN	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
M	GUARD	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
M	AUSTIN	I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
F	VANESSA	Austin, we have to go! I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
M	SCIENTIST	This is the strongest, sharpest drill bit ever produced by man. It weighs fifteen metric tones and can bore through a mile-thick bedrock of solid granite in seven seconds.
M	ANNOUNCER	Attention, there are intruders in the complex.
M	SCIENTIST	Get them!
M	AUSTIN	Judo chop! Judo chop!
M	AUSTIN	Our only way out of here is to drive out!
M	P.A. (O.S.)	There they are!
M	AUSTIN	Hang on! I'm going to floor it!
M	GUARD	Noooooooooooooo!
M	AUSTIN	Where did you learn to shoot?
F	VANESSA	Where did you learn to drive?
M	GUARD	Noooooooooooooo!
F	VANESSA	Austin, watch out!
M	AUSTIN	Where? Where?
M	GUARD	Noooooooooooooo!
F	VANESSA	Thank God, Austin, we made it.
M	AUSTIN	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
M	MIDDLE AGED LADY	Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin. Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin. Yes, that's right, he's a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. What? Killed? How? Run over by a steamroller? Oh my God. Thank you for calling.
M	FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD	Hi Mom! When's Steve coming home? He said he was going to teach me to play ball.
M	MRS. HARWIN	Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news. As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
M	BILLY	Was? What is it, Mom?
M	MRS. HARWIN	Your brother was run over by a steamroller.
M	BILLY	A steamroller? No, not Steve! Since Dad died, Steve's been like a father to me.
M	MRS. HARWIN	I'm sorry son. People never think how things affect the family of the henchman. I love you, Billy. I wonder if we'll be able to receive Steve's henchman's comp.
M	DR. EVIL	Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.
M	DR. EVIL	Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. Powers. Mrs. Kensington's daughter, how lovely. I believe your name is Vanessa? I'd shake your hands, except for obvious reasons.
F	VANESSA	I don't understand.
M	DR. EVIL	My hand, dammit! Look at it!
M	AUSTIN	What's wrong with your hand?
M	DR. EVIL	Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
M	AUSTIN	I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
M	DR. EVIL	Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.
M	AUSTIN	Does that make you horny?
F	VANESSA	Not now, Austin.
M	DR. EVIL	The world's most powerful subterranean drill.
M	DR. EVIL	So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet's hot liquid core. Upon detonation, every volcano on the planet will erupt.
M	AMERICAN UN REPRESENTATIVE	Why should we pay him the money? He's only got one warhead and he's going to detonate it deep underground.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	My God, man, don't you understand? It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes. Imagine no United Kingdom. Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge. Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England...
M	BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE	Any word from Powers?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm afraid we've lost contact with him.
M	BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE	I see.
M	UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY	Dr. Evil, it seems we have no choice but to pay your ransom.
M	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, your deadline is in three hours. You have your instructions. Good-bye.
M	DR. EVIL	Come join us for dinner, won't you Mr. Powers?
M	DR. EVIL	I think you'll enjoy the food. I have the best chef in the world. His name is Ezekial. He's made of seventy-five percent plastic.
M	DR. EVIL	Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
M	DR. EVIL	Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
M	DR. EVIL	And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Yeah. What?
M	DR. EVIL	Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
M	SCOTT EVIL	Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
M	DR. EVIL	In due time.
M	SCOTT EVIL	But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
M	DR. EVIL	I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
M	SCOTT EVIL	Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
M	DR. EVIL	One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
M	DR. EVIL	Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner. They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.
M	AUSTIN	Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
M	DR. EVIL	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
M	DR. EVIL	Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Dr. Evil?
M	DR. EVIL	Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
M	DR. EVIL	Right. Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
M	DR. EVIL	What is it now?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
M	DR. EVIL	I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Sea bass.
M	DR. EVIL	Right.
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	They're mutated sea bass.
M	DR. EVIL	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
M	FRAU FARBISSINA	Please allow me to demonstrate.
M	DR. EVIL	Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
M	SCOTT EVIL	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
M	DR. EVIL	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
M	SCOTT EVIL	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
M	DR. EVIL	No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
F	VANESSA	What's your plan?
M	AUSTIN	First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
F	VANESSA	Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
M	AUSTIN	All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
F	VANESSA	No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
M	AUSTIN	Smashing idea! Give it to me.
M	AUSTIN	Judo chop!
M	GUARD	My eyes! My eyes!
M	AUSTIN	Hold on, Vanessa!
F	VANESSA	Austin, watch out!
M	AUSTIN	Not a good time to lose one's head.
F	VANESSA	Indeed.
M	AUSTIN	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
F	VANESSA	Yes.
M	AUSTIN	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
F	VANESSA	Shut up.
M	AUSTIN	Fair enough.
M	GUY 1	I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow.
M	GUY 2	Where is Smittie anyways? It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party.
M	GUY 3	Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil. Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy? I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor. There's a lot of love in this room.
M	WAITRESS	Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party.
M	GUY 1	Hello? Yes, I have a friend named John Smith. That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army. What? He's dead? Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass? Oh my God! OK, thank you.
M	GUY 2	Hey Bill, what's wrong? Was that John? Is he coming late?
M	GUY 1	Guys, John's not coming.
M	GUY 2	Why?
M	GUY 1	He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass.
M	GUYS	Oh no, oh my God, etc. All right, to Smittie!
M	GUYS	To Smittie!
F	VANESSA	What do we do now?
M	AUSTIN	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
F	VANESSA	I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
M	AUSTIN	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
F	VANESSA	I'll hurry back.
M	AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
F	VANESSA	Austin, what's your point?
M	AUSTIN	Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
F	VANESSA	Oh, behave!
M	DR. EVIL	Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
M	SCOTT EVIL	I don't want to.
M	DR. EVIL	Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Blow me.
M	DR. EVIL	What did you say?
M	SCOTT EVIL	Show me.
M	AUSTIN	Hello, hello.
M	FEMBOT	Hello, Mr. Powers, care to have a little fun?
M	AUSTIN	No, actually, I have to save the world.
M	AUSTIN	Is it cold in here?
M	DR. EVIL	Arm the probe!
M	AUSTIN	I've got to get Dr. Evil! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!
M	DR. EVIL	Probe in place.
M	DR. EVIL	Five minutes to go. Let the penetration countdown begin.
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN	Five minutes and COUN-ting.
M	FEMBOT	You can't resist us, Mr. Powers. Eventually you'll give in.
M	AUSTIN	Au contraire, I think you can't resist me.
M	AUSITN	Oh, I fell over.
M	AUSTIN	It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys.
F	VANESSA	Likewise.
M	AUSTIN	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
F	VANESSA	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
M	AUSTIN	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
M	DR. EVIL	Activate the blast shutters!
M	DR. EVIL	Launch the subterranean probe!
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN	We have penetration. Subterranean detonation-- two minutes and COUN- ting.
M	AUSTIN	Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
F	VANESSA	Are you crazy?
M	AUSTIN	Don't worry!
M	AUSTIN	Blast! Out of ammo.
F	VANESSA	Austin, I'm coming with you.
M	AUSTIN	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
F	VANESSA	I'll secure the perimeter.
M	DR. EVIL (O.S.)	Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!
M	DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)	Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
M	AUSTIN	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
M	DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)	Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
M	AUSTIN	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
M	DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)	That does not compute.
M	AUSTIN	Why not? It's a question. Love is... love is... love is...
M	DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)	Remjack! Remjack! Daisy, Daisy... Remjackremjackremjack!
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN	Subterranean detonation-- one minute and COUN-ting.
M	AUSTIN	Where's the abort button?
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN	Forty-five seconds and COUN-ting. It's right over there.
M	AUSTIN	Ow! That really hurt. I'm going to have a lump there, you idiot! Who throws a shoe? You fight like a woman.
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN	Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.
M	AUSTIN	Care for a drink?
M	AUSTIN	Shocking.
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN	Three... two... one...
M	AUSTIN	Nooooooo!
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN	Abort.
M	AUSTIN	I've got you, Dr. Evil!
M	DR. EVIL	Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
M	AUSTIN	No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same. It's freedom, man.
M	DR. EVIL	Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
M	AUSTIN	That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
M	DR. EVIL	Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
M	ALOTTA	Not so fast.
M	DR. EVIL	Well, it seems the tables have turned, Mr. Powers.
M	SCOTT EVIL	Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?
M	AUSTIN	It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
M	DR. EVIL	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
M	AUSTIN	Man, you are one chilly square!
M	SCOTT EVIL	Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
M	DR. EVIL	I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
M	SCOTT EVIL	I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
M	DR. EVIL	Scott, don't say that...
F	VANESSA	This is for sleeping with my man, you whore!
M	ALOTTA	I didn't sleep with him.
F	VANESSA	I don't believe you.
M	ALOTTA	It's the teeth.
F	VANESSA	OK, I believe you. But you still must be chopped.
F	VANESSA	Judo chop!
M	EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.)	Five minutes to self-destruct and COUN-ting.
M	AUSTIN	Let's split!
F	VANESSA	I have something to tell you.
M	AUSTIN	Lay it on me.
F	VANESSA	I love you, Austin.
M	AUSTIN	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
F	VANESSA	Kiss me.
M	AUSTIN	Behave!
M	AUSTIN	Just when things were getting interesting.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
M	AUSTIN	I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Because of your exemplary service to Her Majesty, you are now officially an active Field Agent with all the privileges and responsibilities thereof.
F	VANESSA	Thank you, Exposition. I'm honored.
M	AUSTIN	Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, I have something for you as well.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
M	AUSTIN	Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
F	VANESSA	Oh, Austin.
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, now, about your next mission--
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
M	AUSTIN	Yes Basil?
M	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful!
M	DR. EVIL (V.O.)	I'll get you yet, Austin Powers! Now you can get all the Austin Powers movies in one Laser Disk box set!
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Relive all your favorite Austin Powers movies, including...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Middle Name: Danger.
M	AUSTIN	So, Dr. Evil, do you expect the world to pay the ransom?
M	DR. EVIL	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	No Austin Powers collection would be complete without some of the later hits, like... Four Eyes Only.
M	ROGER MOORE	Oh, behave!
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	We've also included some of the more obscure hits, like...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	From India With Affection.
M	INDIAN AUSITN	Well, my good fellow, are you expecting me to pay the ransom to you, you despot?
M	INDIAN DR. EVIL	No kind sir, I expect you to go up in the evolutionary chain. But first, I expect you to sing.
M	INDIAN AUSTIN	'IF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF LOVE, LET'S BAKE A CAKE.' All the Austin Powers adventures in one Laser Disk boxed set!
M	AUSTIN	Behave!
