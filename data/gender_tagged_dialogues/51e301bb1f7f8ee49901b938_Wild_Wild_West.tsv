M	MORTON	Madman... Hideous spider... Run... Run! Warn the President... cowering.
M	MORTON	Noooooooo!!!!!
M	McGRATH	And they says you scientists are supposed to be smart.
M	SALOON GIRL (O.S.)	The legendary Captain James West and I finally got him all to myself.
M	WEST	That's right, sugar, and you should feel free to treat him just bad.
M	WEST	General McGrath's boys. I thought y'all was never gonna show up.
M	SALOON GIRL	Mister West, you wouldn't be here workin' tonight, now would you?
M	WEST	No, no. 'Course not. Not tonight. Would you be working if you were up here with you?
M	SALOON GIRL	Good. roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul
F	DORA	I'm sorry. That won't be possible. I have... tonsillitis. tower.
M	BIG REB	Pack'er up good, Virgil. Next stop N'Orleans.
M	SALOON GIRL	Jim!
M	WEST	Ah, this hole is a safety issue. I'm thinking, what if it starts to rain and the water level goes up. It could suck you right up. I'm protecting you. (variations)
M	SALOON GIRL	Problem solved.
M	WEST	Belle, you don't just ram a man's underbritches into a knothole. You wanna plug the hole, you ram your own britches in there.
M	SALOON GIRL	Oh, Jim.
M	WEST	Much as I'd like to take credit for that you might need to hand me my gun...
M	WEST	... Hand me my gun.
M	WEST	Okay, who just made a wish? Was it you?
M	WEST	I could sure use those clothes now.
M	BIG REB	Well, we got us a shy nig...
M	WEST	Fought five long years with the Union Army not to hear that word again. And you boys lost, remember?
M	WEST	How 'bout some pants!?
M	McGRATH	I'm still waiting on my guns and ammo, but I see my men have brought your merchandise.
M	McGRATH	I had expected to be delivering it personally to Mr...
M	HUDSON	My employer, here in a brothel? That would be quite... redundant.
M	HUDSON	You'll meet him when the time -- and place -- are appropriate. Now... ... shall we go upstairs to check the 'merchandise'?
M	McGRATH	Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't planning to walk those oaken stairs with you. Direct me to the poot, sir. Something young and creamy. A gamer that takes to the crop and spur.
M	EYE-CROSSED REB	You drive a hard bargain, lady. All right, fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and...
F	DORA	Still not interested.
M	EYE-CROSSED REB	But you gotta be interested. You're a whore.
F	DORA	That doesn't mean a girl can't have high standards.
M	WEST	Could I have a little privacy here?
M	WEST	Thank you.
M	WEST	darlin'... but my evidence is getting away.
M	WEST	Sorry about there not being any towels. lollypop.
M	McGRATH	What's your name, missy?
M	GORDON/DORA	Dora. Would you like to go upstairs?
M	McGRATH	Oh, indeedy I would.
M	EYE-CROSSED REB	Hey, c'mere! Who the hell are you anyway?!
M	McGRATH	She's... mine!
M	McGRATH	I feel like... a ditty!
M	GORDON/DORA	A ditty? But General... ... my talents really lay elsewhere.
M	McGRATH	Nothing stokes the fire in my loins like a ditty.
M	McGRATH	You've got some pretty fair lungs on ya, girl, now use 'em!
M	GORDON/DORA	'Buy a drink for the boys In the backroom for me...'
M	WEST	Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon full of nitro...!
M	GORDON/DORA	'And tell them I tried... And tell them I cried...'
M	WEST	Whoa now...!
M	WEST	I said, whoa!!!
M	WEST	Well, well, this is workin' out to be a perfect day. My man... ... General Bloodbath McGrath.
M	GORDON/CROWD	And tell them I tried just the same...!
M	GORDON/DORA	Well, that's a new one.
M	McGRATH	Don't let the ear scare you. I lost it at Chickamauga.
M	GORDON/DORA	Oh really. One can hardly notice... Would you mind...? I... I... can't seem to release the clasp of my belt.
M	McGRATH	Wha... what's this?
M	GORDON/DORA	It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe your old swimmin' hole. Getting sleepy, General?
M	McGRATH	Yes, I'm sleepy.
M	GORDON	Good. You're going to be my little doggy. And when I say 'speak,' you tell me everything I want to know. Understood?
M	McGRATH	Woof!
M	GORDON	All right, little doggy. Sit up. Now tell me who's in the sack next door. Is it the scientist, Dr. Escobar? Speak!
M	McGRATH	Woof! Woof!
M	GORDON	Speak words, dumb doggy! Tell me the name of the man you kidnapped him for...
M	GORDON	Watch the swirling spiral! Lie down, bad dog!
M	WEST	Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am. Looked like you could use some help.
M	GORDON	Looks can be deceivin'... dark stranger. I am perfectly fine.
M	WEST	I can see that, darlin'. Woman of your caliber probably gets top dollar, too. So here you go. You can run along. I'll take care of McGrath.
M	GORDON/DORA	No! I need him!
M	WEST	C'mon, lady. You got the money. Have a little dignity.
M	McGRATH	West...!!! McGrath's men, but Hudson and his crew. A melee will
M	HUDSON	Get Escobar out of here! Leave him right there.
M	GORDON	Let's go, Hudson... hands!
M	GORDON	Thank... you.
M	WEST	U.S. Army... Now get outta my way, lady!
M	GORDON	I'm no lady! I'm a U.S. Marshal! You get out of my way! wig...
M	LIPPENREIDER	Get out of my way... get out of my way... U.S. Army... U.S. Marshal.
M	LOVELESS	Oh, dear...
M	HUDSON	Federal agents inside, sir!
M	LOVELESS	So Miss Lippenreider informs me. Still, I believe good manners dictate we should send out...
M	LOVELESS	... the welcome wagon.
M	WEST	So now what...?
M	HOUSE DETECTIVE	Whoa there, 'pardner.' Winning the war may have got you forty acres and a mule, but you can't just traipse into the President's office. Now gimme that gun.
M	WEST	This gun?
M	WEST	Or this one?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)	Gentlemen!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Don't make Captain West any later for his appointment than he already is!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Been a lot of death threats lately ... Cabinet made me hire some damn detectives. Drink, cigar?
M	WEST	Thank you, sir.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I hear you let General McGrath get away?
M	WEST	Sir, I had him right in my hands when some half-a-sissy wearin' a dress ruined...
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Artemus Gordon.
M	WEST	You... know him?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Of course I know him, he's the best marshal I've got! He's a genius. Gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect. Nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his President... except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy!
M	WEST	Who are you?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I am the President of the United States!
M	WEST	Wrong answer. Who are you?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I am the President of... ... I'm Artemus Gordon.
M	WEST	The President went to West Point ... not Harvard.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)	Will somebody tell me what the hell this stunt is all about!?!
M	GORDON	Sir, in perilous times like these, I was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very bowels of the White House...
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	You're clever, Gordon. One day it'll get you killed.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	... And you, West -- not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later, shoot again -- then when they're all dead, try to ask a question or two. Working together will be good for both of you.
M	WEST AND GORDON	But, sir, I work...
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	You work the way your Commander In Chief tells you to work.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Ten of our country's best scientists... all kidnapped in the last year. By General McGrath, it now seems. The fact is, gentlemen, you've both been working on the same case all along. Why did it take you so long to realize it?
M	WEST	Well, sir, one of us was still trying to figure out if he was a man or a woman.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I don't have time for this bickering! One week, if we're to believe this...
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	'General Grant, the scientists that you seek are in my employ --
M	PRESIDENT GRANT (CONT'D)	-- Creating a weapons system beyond the pale of contemporary imagination. History and justice are on my side. I suggest you put your affairs in order. You have one week before you will surrender the U.S. Government.'
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	This letter was delivered inside this.
M	GORDON	Marzipan, isn't it?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Wait!
M	WEST	It's McGrath, sir. The South is rising again. I'm gonna stop it.
M	GORDON	Sir, West's obsession aside, McGrath may be a vicious killer, but a mastermind he is not. So whom do we seek? After consulting with Intelligence...
M	WEST	McGrath's headed for New Orleans. The longer we stand here talkin', the farther away he gets. I don't need 'Intelligence' to tell me that.
M	GORDON	Ah, so that would mean you rely on ... Stupidity?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Gentlemen! I'm leaving today for Utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at Promontory Point.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	For the first time the United States will truly be united. Someone wants us divided. Now look, you two are the best I've got. Put aside your differences and stop this madman... whoever he is. If you fail, well... we may never know how great this country could've been. You have a week. Dismissed!
M	AIDE	The President has put a private train at your disposal. Engine number five, track six. Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.
M	WEST	Figures.
M	GORDON	I call it the Bi-axle Nitro- Combust...
M	WEST	Save it. I've gotta train to catch.
M	WEST	Yee-haaa!!
M	GORDON	Avant!!!
M	WEST	Stop this train!! You hear me!?!
M	GORDON	Thanks for dropping in.
M	WEST	Forget the bikes, the beards, the fake boobies. Put down the needlepoint and let's settle this like men!
M	GORDON	As a matter of clarification, this isn't needlepoint. This is.
M	GORDON	Right now, I'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation. I call it... The Impermeable. It's a vest that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range.
M	WEST	Really?
M	GORDON	But it hasn't been really tested empirically yet.
M	WEST	Get up!
M	GORDON	Guns. I find them so primitive and unnecessary... if one has done one's proper planning.
M	WEST	Yeah? How do you feel about a fist?
M	GORDON	I must tell you, Mr. West, I've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part.
M	WEST	Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you failed.
M	GORDON	I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought this on yourself.
M	GORDON	I love this train!
M	GORDON	The President asked for my suggestions on how to make the Wanderer both comfortable and functional...
M	GORDON	And while you're down there, you may want to avail yourself of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail Egressor...
M	WEST	Only one doin' any 'egressin' is gonna be you.
M	GORDON	Perhaps the President was right about us putting aside our petty differences. 'The opposite is beneficial, from things that differ comes the fairest attunement.' Aristotle.
M	COLEMAN	Knock each other about all ya please, but harm my train and I'll douse ya like dogs.
M	GORDON	That's my veal reduction sauce!
M	COLEMAN	Well then, let's get on about our business, shall we, gentlemen? Now, where to?
M	WEST	New Orleans.
M	GORDON	Shall we let Professor Morton decide?
M	WEST	Who?
M	GORDON	Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton, expert in the field of metallurgy ... discovered in a field of alfalfa. Kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago.
M	WEST	That's a man's head!
M	GORDON	... And this magnetic collar was around it when his body was discovered. Haven't figured that one out yet...
M	WEST	That's a man's head.
M	GORDON	According to the Retinal Terminus Theory... a dying person's last conscious image is burned into the back of the eyeball like a photograph. Perhaps there's a clue there...
M	GORDON	Morton's last image!
M	WEST	That's a man's head!
M	GORDON	Ah. The refraction of the lenses causes the image to appear upside down. We simply...
M	WEST	It's McGrath. I was right all along.
M	GORDON	He seems to have something in his pocket... too fuzzy to read, though...
M	GORDON	Mortification of the aqueous humor seems to have led to the loss of...
M	WEST	... glasses.
M	WEST	'Friends of the South! Come to a Surprise Costume Ball. April 14, eight-thirty. 346 Garden Street... ' Like I said.... New Orleans. How about this? You could come as my man servant?
M	GORDON	How about this? You could come as my man servant.
M	WEST	Oh yes, Massa Gordon, dats what I'll do. And I'll jus' smile and do as I's tole so those people won' ever know that I would rather shoot myself in the head than play your god damned man servant!
M	GORDON	I have a horse costume. You could be the head.
M	WEST	The only thing I need to wear is this.
M	GORDON	Okay, if you insist on carrying a firearm, I have something I think you'll find intriguing...
M	GORDON	And it would go nicely with this...
M	WEST	Jim West does not wear a dress.
M	GORDON	Then what's your plan?
M	WEST	How 'bout this: I'll go as a government agent who's gonna kill McGrath.
M	GORDON	An armed, Negro cowboy costume, how creative. In a room full of white Southerners, you oughtta fit right in. You might even win first prize!
M	GORDON	Listen to me. The art of disguise is what's going to get us into that party, thus allowing us to find these kidnapped scientists before they're forced to create something that will destroy this great country.
M	GORDON (CONT'D)	Now you and I are the chosen ones, Jim. We're under direct orders from the President himself. And our mission is clear: Save our country. Our freedom is at stake you go as a riverboat captain and I'll be a saloon girl.
M	WEST	Let me tell you a little something about beloved 'art of disguise'... That night at Fat-Can's, I knew you weren't a woman.
M	GORDON	But I was propositioned by three men.
M	WEST	Gordon, you looked nasty. Your breasts were all hard and stiff, and were sticking straight out like two rusty cannons on a sunken ship.
M	GORDON	These are a work of art. Scientifically and aesthetically perfect.
M	WEST	They look like shit.
M	GORDON	Touch them.
M	WEST	I don't wanna touch 'em. I can see I don't like 'em.
M	GORDON	What, are you afraid you're wrong? Touch my breasts. Coleman peeks around the corner to see West eyeing
M	COLEMAN	I knew it. Well, I'll have no part of it!
M	WEST	There, Gordon, you happy? I'm touching your breasts.
M	GORDON	Not so rough. The buckwheat'll come out.
M	WEST	Buckwheat? That's your problem.
M	GORDON	What are you doing?
M	WEST	Now, squeeze this. This is what a breast should feel like. see...
M	GORDON	Whoa...
M	WEST	Isn't that nice?
M	GORDON	Very nice.
M	WEST	Now touch yourself.
M	GORDON	You win. I'm hard.
M	COLEMAN	Federal officers, bah!
M	GORDON	I was just going to jot down a thought.
M	WEST	You know something, that's a good place to put a gun.
M	GORDON	But then, where would I keep my notepad.
M	WEST	You know, Artemus, I think you underestimate the convenience of a pocket.
M	GUARD	You got about as much chance of havin' an invitation as him.
M	WEST	Matter of fact, got it right here.
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	Hey... get your hands off me!
F	RITA	Put me in the dungeon with all those smelly, dirty bearded men ... but I am not goin' in there.
F	AMAZONIA	You applied for the position.
F	RITA	Yeah, a standing up position. I'm an entertainer, not a...
M	MISS LIPPENREIDER	Do not be selfish and stupid. He always spoils his new girl.
F	RITA	Yeah. Well gimme a simple diamond bracelet instead of that...
M	MUNITIA	It is not so bad... once the metal warms up.
M	SULTRY WOMAN (O.S.)	An authentic cowboy outfit... complete with six-guns!
M	DRAGON LADY	What a terribly clever costume, Mr...?
M	WEST	... West. Jim West.
M	DRAGON LADY	Well... West meets East. Mae Lee East. Are you here alone, Mr. West?
M	WEST	Actually I'm, uh trying to surprise an old friend -- General McGrath. Seen him around anywhere?
M	MISS EAST (DRAGON LADY)	I don't believe that name was on our guest list. And I would know. I'm Dr. Loveless's personal assistant.
M	WEST	Dr. Arliss Loveless...? One of the great founders of the Confederacy with Jefferson Davis. Funny how most people think he's dead.
M	MISS EAST	Tonight's his coming-out party.
M	MISS EAST	See anybody that looks familiar?
M	WEST	Matter of fact, I do.
M	MISS EAST	I'm... jealous. Meet me later... in the foyer.
M	DISTAFF CORPS	'Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord...'
M	DISTAFF CORPS	'He has trampled down the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored!'
M	LOVELESS	Don't you just hate that song?
M	LOVELESS	Why, y'all look like you've seen a ghost! It's me, dear friends, alive and kicking! Well, alive, anyway... everything else in that vicinity that makes life interesting.
M	LOVELESS	We may've lost the war, but heaven knows... we haven't lost our sense of humor!
M	LOVELESS	Not even when we've lost a lung... a spleen... a bladder... two legs... thirty-five feet of small reproduce... All in the name of the South... ... do we lose our sense of humor.
M	LOVELESS	I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my friends across the sea for their comfort and... succor.
M	LOVELESS	So...! Mi casa es su casa! Ma maison est a vous! Let the party begin!!!
M	LOVELESS	Mr. West, how nice of you to join us tonight... and add color to these monochromatic proceedings.
M	WEST	Well, when a man comes back from the dead, it's an occasion to stand and be counted.
M	LOVELESS	Miss East informs me that you were expecting to meet General McGrath here. I knew him years ago... but haven't seen him in a coon's age.
M	WEST	I bet a man like yourself would find it difficult to keep in touch with even half the people you know.
M	LOVELESS	Perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment.
M	WEST	Well, you know beautiful women... they encourage you one second, cut the legs out from under you the next.
M	WEST	Hey, honey... I see a big ole spider up on the wall. Hope it doesn't drop down your pretty dress. study.
M	GORDON	Peeking through the keyhole...? So 18th Century.
M	McGRATH	Dr. Loveless, my men are ready to go to war with no weapons to fight. Ever since the nitro and the guns were destroyed at Fat- Can's, lice and demoralization have set in!
M	LOVELESS	Your men will have their weapons tonight. And my promise that they will be part of the greatest military victory of this century!
M	McGRATH	Oh, you're a pip, sir! I'd follow you into the maw of Cerberus himself!
M	LOVELESS	And so you shall. Have your men here at... 10 o'clock tonight.
M	MISS EAST	I said to meet me in the foyer.
M	WEST	Oh, the foy-aay. Sorry, I've never been much good at French.
M	MISS EAST	Au contraire...
M	MISS EAST	So let's see, Mr. West... are you a dangerous spy of some sort? Or just a handsome cowboy who likes to... poke around.
M	WEST	Um... that second one. French, Spanish, German) when he sees something of interest.
M	GORDON	Howdy there... big sturdy gal. Yer dance card full?
M	WEST	Thanks for helpin' me get to the bottom of this case.
M	WEST	Real impressed the way you got the dance floor staked out. Maybe one of your missin' scientists'll cut in. Thought you should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear tonight... I found that our host, Dr. Loveless...
M	WEST	... is meeting McGrath and his troops at Malheureux Point in an hour. So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna go save the Republic.
M	WEST	But I will say, good work on your bladders tonight... they're damn perky.
M	GORDON/MOUNTAIN MAN	Hang him!
M	GEORGE WASHINGTON	Looks like we're gonna have to teach y'all a little lesson on how to behave in polite society.
M	WEST	Don't grab a white lady's boobies at the big redneck dance. Is that the lesson? Well, I learned it. Don't scratch your head with the shrimp fork. I got that one too. So whaddaya say we call this off?
M	GORDON	I feel as if we know each other from someplace...?
F	RITA	Try again, buster...!
M	GORDON	Ma'am, please! While I realize I look like something straight out of James Fenimore Cooper... I mean you no harm. My name is Artemus Gordon. And you look like you're in trouble.
F	RITA	Really?
F	RITA	I'm Rita. I was hired here as an entertainer. Not that I'm complaining, but what are you doin' in here?
M	GORDON	Looking for some missing scientists... not that I'm complaining.
M	GORDON	I'm a special U.S. Marshal on assignment from the President.
F	RITA	If you're so special, how come you're lookin' up here when Loveless has 'em all workin' down in the dungeon? Get me out of here and I'll take you down there.
M	GORDON	Too late. The 'dungeon' is cleaned out. It was the first place I checked, right after I sampled the gumbo. Bit heavy on the okra.
F	RITA	Thank you... Artemus, was it?
M	GORDON	One doesn't forget a smile like that. Now where in the world was it...? Have you ever played the Empire Room... the Bijou Cafe perhaps...?
M	WEST	Can I have everyone's attention please. I think we've had a series of major misunderstandings and I'd like to take a moment to clear them up. First, the whole drumming on the boobies thing. In my native land, Africa, my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages. I'm sure y'all can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on a clear day, we might even get Galveston. All I was saying was, 'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,' 'How's your mama?'
M	WEST (CONT'D)	Second misunderstanding. That redneck comment. I'm getting the sense that some of you took that negatively. You know, some of my best friends are whiskey-guzzling, pot-bellied rednecks just like y'all here. That slavery thing, I don't see what the big deal was. Hell, who wouldn't want somebody to run around for them doing chores. Are you going to get your big, fat, lazy ass out of bed every morning and pick your own damn cotton. I don't think so. Let's head on inside and knock back some shine. Come on, back inside. No. Okay. I stand before you as a man who realizes he has done something wrong and I am prepared to do the right thing. Will you marry me?
M	WEST	I'll take that as a no. Darling, would it help at all if I said I thought you were a man?
M	WEST	Guess not.
M	GEORGE WASHINGTON	Hang him!
M	GORDON (O.S.)	Hey-yaa!!!
M	WEST	Hang 'm...!
M	WEST	Hang'm!?!
M	GORDON	Meet my trigger-happy partner, James West... who doesn't seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists.
M	WEST	Scientist, huh.
M	GORDON	This is Rita. I found her locked in a cage in Loveless's bedroom. She's an entertainer.
F	RITA	Um, maybe I haven't been quite honest about that... My name is Rita Escobar. I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist, my... father.
M	GORDON	Professor Escobar?! He was the one I almost rescued that night when... That's where I know you from! Fat-Can Candy's... you sang before I did.
F	RITA	Excuse me?
M	GORDON	That was me. Burgundy dress with the bustle...
M	WEST	Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case. When I find your father I promise I'll send him back safely...
F	RITA	He's impulsive, James.
M	LOVELESS	Well, General, it's been a long journey from New Liberty.
M	McGRATH	Sir, there isn't a day that passes that I don't contemplate it.
M	LOVELESS	Yes, and so do I. So do I. If I'd only had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that I have today...
M	McGRATH	That's not what I meant.
M	LOVELESS	Oh, you mean the stomach-churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre...
M	LOVELESS	What was that nickname again?
M	McGRATH	'Bloodbath' McGrath... the Butcher of New Liberty.' They oughta be here by now.
M	REB #2	Maybe we're in the wrong place.
M	REB #1	No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly on this here spot.
M	McGRATH	Why you sawed-off sadistic bastard! You've betrayed us!
M	LOVELESS	My dear General, after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this... how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom?
M	LOVELESS	Munitia, make note. Turret speed needs to be accelerated!
M	MUNITIA	Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8!
F	AMAZONIA	A bucket for the minister, please!
M	LIPPENREIDER	Scream. Scream. My head. I'm dying. Scream. Moan. Scream.
M	McGRATH	Loveless, I demand you give the order to stop this slaughter now!
M	LOVELESS	... We're going to need more loading drills! I'm hearing too much time between screams.
M	McGRATH	For the last time, give them the order to desist!
M	LOVELESS	General, I understand your distress. But believe me, those men are not dying senselessly. It is for a far greater cause than you can imagine.
M	McGRATH	Go straight to hell, sir!
M	LOVELESS	After you... sir.
M	LOVELESS	Bloodbath McGrath indeed.
M	LOVELESS	Well, that concludes the festivities. Ladies, feed him to the crabs. dignitaries...
M	LOVELESS	But, my friends, that tank is just a little ol' toy compared to what this country's greatest scientists are cooking up for me next. So if I've piqued your interest, bring 1000 kilograms of your country's gold to Spider Canyon four days from now. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a tank to catch.
M	LOVELESS	My destination is both the future... and the past! Forget Paul Revere, this will be the most revolutionary ride in the history of America!!
M	LOVELESS	If you don't want to miss the ride, have the last payment of 1000 kilograms of your country's gold in my hands no later than Friday. That's when I make our little proposal to President Grant. One I'm ever so confident he's gonna accept. Au revoir, adios, and ta-ta!
M	GORDON	It came up out of the lake... from the way these corpses are positioned, laid down a 360-degree pattern of cannon fire... then disappeared in moments. My God, what kind of weapon is it?
F	RITA	Excuse me, I think I'm going to be sick.
M	WEST	It just rolls on and on. Makes a screeching sound -- like a wounded animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with a cannon... swivels 'round like an eagle's head.
M	GORDON	You saw it?
M	WEST	Heard about it. Thought it was crazy survivors' stories.
M	GORDON	What survivors? There aren't any here.
M	WEST	New Liberty, Illinois -- the free slave town just over the border. Just one week before the War ended in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry that discovered it. Old men, women, children... they used them for target practice...
M	WEST	That's when I vowed to follow McGrath to the end of the earth.
M	McGRATH	What's the matter, West? Thought you'd be happy to find me... like this.
M	WEST	I was hoping to kill you myself.
F	RITA	That's a nice way to talk to people.
M	McGRATH	I've lived with the blame for New Liberty.
M	WEST	What do you mean?
M	McGRATH	It was Loveless... his plan. He operated the killing machine there. Smarter now... left it to others here.
M	WEST	Where is he? Where did he go?!
M	RITA (O.S.)	Well, I know that.
F	RITA	I'll tell you if you take me along.
M	WEST	Just tell me.
F	RITA	The girls at the mansion. They talk. 'I vonder if my hair vill get frissy in ze desert...? Vhere is diss Ooo-tah anyvay?'
M	WEST/GORDON	Ooo-tah?!
M	WEST	Coleman... let's go! Full speed ahead!
M	COLEMAN	Aye, sir!
M	GORDON	I don't see why we couldn't have given her a ride back home to Texas. It is on the way...
M	WEST	President happens to be. Maybe we oughta be worryin' about that little coincidence!
M	GORDON	We wouldn't have known where Loveless was going if it wasn't for her. Seems a bit ungracious. Possibly perilous.
M	WEST	Look, all that would happen would be she'd get in our way and I'd probably wind up gettin' in the saddle with her.
M	GORDON	Funny that you say that. Because I thought she was more interested in me. You know, I've been trying to place myself in Loveless's shoes...
M	WEST	Good luck on that one.
M	GORDON	Ha, ha, ha... You know, I can't imagine what Loveless -- a man without any reproductive organs could possibly want with Rita.
M	GORDON (O.S.)	Not that Rita doesn't have a figure that would inspire a Botticelli... or a Raphael. see her there.
M	GORDON	... especially her breasts. Did you notice the way one of them... Both of them actually... to say nothing of her buttocks...
M	GORDON	... and the group of foreign ministers at Loveless's party... What were they doing there?
M	GORDON	Here's France, Spain and Britain... How long has she been here?
M	WEST	Since the first breast.
M	GORDON	I am so embarrassed.
M	WEST	I'll spare you. Make yourself a sandwich to take with you. You're getting off.
F	RITA	But... I can help you.
M	WEST	How could you possibly help us?
F	RITA	Well, I heard you talking about why all those foreign guys were at Loveless's party...? You want me to tell you?
M	GORDON	By all means.
F	RITA	This is fantastic. You can cut it with a fork! How'd you cook it?
M	GORDON	Well, in a daubiere... a clay pot. A French method which...
M	WEST	What about the foreign guys?!
F	RITA	They were mad about something, you know? Something about a real bad deal in Louisiana on purpose.
M	GORDON	The Louisiana Purchase?
F	RITA	And Queen somebody-somebody of France got swindled.
M	GORDON	Queen Isabella of Spain.
M	WEST	Gordon, this is crazy. She doesn't know what she's talking about!
M	WEST	Coleman, stop the train! Miss Escobar's getting off.
M	COLEMAN (V.O.)	Who the hell's Miss Escobar?
F	RITA	I'm a frightened, starving, half- naked young woman who only wants to find her father!
M	COLEMAN (V.O.)	Half-naked?
M	WEST	Coleman... stop the train.
M	COLEMAN (V.O.)	We're not puttin' anybody off. Not out here in the middle of nowhere.
F	RITA	Please, Jim. My father's the only family I've got. What am I supposed to do? Sit home and wait for news he's been killed? Or go do something! What would you do, Jim?!
M	WEST	Look, I got nothing against you, Rita. It's just that... What's going to happen when we catch up to Loveless... with you on the train?
F	RITA	I know you'd never let him take me back. I've seen you shoot.
M	GORDON	I assure you, Rita, an attack by Loveless would be an exercise in futility. ... Allow me to demonstrate how my design suggestions have made the Wanderer impervious to attack.
M	WEST	I'm the impervious part.
M	GORDON	Hardly. Completely armor- plated... fixture is actually a Gatling gun.
M	GORDON	An attacker would find the lighting inside extremely... unflattering.
M	GORDON	And if, by some inconceivable fluke, they did manage to gain entrance... An innocent billiard ball this way. But depress the number... a sleeping gas bomb. Effective in under three seconds.
M	GORDON	So rest assured, Rita... you are completely safe within these walls.
M	WEST	I don't know about you, ma'am, but I know I'll be sleeping a whole lot better tonight... ... assuming Loveless barges in here and feels like a game of pool.
F	RITA	Speaking of sleeping, I'm pretty tired. Artemus, do you think I could borrow something to wear?
M	WEST	I've got somethin' you might use. It ain't stylish, but it's practical...
M	WEST	Loveless kidnapped two chemists, that means there's gonna be explosives. He's got a metallurgist, so there's gonna be heavy armor. And he's got Rita's father, who -- according to you -- is the world's foremost specialist in hydraulics. Which means, whatever it is... it's gonna move.
M	WEST	So what, is he building that's gonna make the President fall to his knees and surrender the country?
M	GORDON	A bedside heater.
M	WEST	What?
M	GORDON	Rita. She needs a bedside heater. I mean, it gets cold in there, you know, with the stained glass window right over the --
M	GORDON	Such a pleasant girl. A real breath of fresh ass.
M	WEST	You said ass.
M	GORDON	Did I? No...
M	COLEMAN (V.O.)	We have Loveless, gentlemen! Seven hundred yards and closing!
F	RITA	What's going on?
M	GORDON	Stay back here, take cover!
M	WEST	What the hell is this?
M	GORDON	I took the liberty of installing it while you were sleeping.
M	WEST	Leave my stuff alone!
M	COLEMAN	Am I missin' somethin' here...?
M	LOVELESS	Amazonia, shall we disabuse our friends of the notion that one's problems are solved when we see the light at the end of the tunnel!
M	GORDON	Jim, we're the ones chasing Loveless, correct? Then perhaps you could explain what they're doing behind us.
M	WEST	They couldn't fire the cannon at us from in front. Any other questions?
M	WEST	Would it put you out too much to throw me a rope and hit your little secret button?
M	GORDON	I taught him how it worked.
F	RITA	You know you could put a gun on that thing.
M	MUNITIA	I have them square in my sights, sire.
M	LOVELESS	As do I, Munitia... as do I. Fire away! Indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle.
M	LOVELESS	Close the fire door!
F	RITA	I won't let Loveless take me again! I'd rather be dead!
M	GORDON	That's not a good one to wish for.
F	RITA	Please, Artemus, don't leave me alone!
M	WEST (O.S.)	It's me, Jim. Open up!
F	RITA	It's a trick, I know Loveless.
M	GORDON	Rita, no! It's just...
M	WEST	Too damn late, is what it is.
M	WEST	An innocent billiard ball this way, but depress the number and on impact... a sleeping-gas bomb.
M	GORDON	Don't move!
M	LOVELESS	Continue, Miss Lippenreider...
M	MISS LIPPENREIDER	West. Let go of my leg! Gordon. Listen to me. Loveless collared us with the same metal device we found on Morton.
M	LOVELESS	Oh, Munitia... I hope we're not going to leave evidence behind like we did last time.
M	MUNITIA	Nitro this time, sire.
M	LOVELESS	Good morning, gentlemen! I trust you slept well.
M	GORDON	What have you done with Rita?
M	LOVELESS	Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita is sleeping off the after-effects in the stateroom. Quite lovely, isn't she? Who knows... I might even become 'familiar' with her myself.
M	WEST	And that would become one more reason why I'm going to kill you.
M	LOVELESS	Yes, Mr. West, I'm sure a well- endowed blackamoor like yourself must find it absolutely impossible... that a freak like me could fully enjoy the pleasure of a woman. But having witnessed my use of mechinology so far... wouldn't you think I could provide myself with something for the lower half of my body that was hard-pumping and indefatigably steely?
M	LOVELESS	... And speaking of 'hard pumping...' Mr. Coleman, full steam ahead!
M	LOVELESS	What a marvelous train! You don't mind if I borrow it, do you, gentlemen?
M	LOVELESS (CONT'D)	Other than a lack of wheelchair access, I find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles from here to my laboratory in Spider Canyon... I'll be seeing President Grant soon at Promontory Point. What shall I tell him for you? I'm afraid it can't be that you're alive and well...
M	WEST	Gordon, get out your little tool kit and get this damn thing off of me!
M	GORDON	'Gentlemen, welcome to the Loveless Experimental Camp for Political Dissidents. There are no guards. No barbed wire. As long as you stay within the designated perimeter, you will stay alive.'
M	MISS LIPPENREIDER	West. How do you know it's not just bullshit? Gordon. Step over the fence and find out. Rita and I will put flowers on your grave every year.
M	WEST	I don't have time for this.
M	GORDON	Wait, I have an auxiliary tool kit!
M	WEST	See? Nothing happened.
M	GORDON	Oh, really...?
M	WEST	me now?
M	MUNITIA	Caviar...?
M	LIPPENREIDER	Blini...?
M	LOVELESS	Rita, my dear, not that I'm ungrateful to Providence for bringing you back to me...
M	LOVELESS	... I'm just a wee bit curious as to how you managed to wind up with them.
F	RITA	Well, they uh... seemed so... sure that they could find you... and I thought if I stayed with them... they'd lead me back to... all my friends...
F	RITA	And not to give you a big head but... I kinda missed you.
M	LOVELESS	Isn't that a coincidence? I miss me, too.
M	GORDON	Head for that gully!
M	WEST	When I give the signal. Jump off the cliff into my arms.
M	GORDON	Are you crazy?! Do you see what's down there?
M	WEST	Five, four, three, two...
M	GORDON	Forget it. I'm not doing it...
M	WEST	One...
M	GORDON	Oh shit!
M	GORDON	I just remembered... I can't swim!
M	WEST	You won't have to!
M	WEST	Maybe I should have stayed inside that fence another moment or two.
M	WEST	All right, Gordon, what's your plan? How are you gonna get this damn thing off my neck?
M	GORDON	Excuse me?
M	WEST	Isn't that why you're here? 'Cause you're the master of, you know, mechanical stuff?
M	GORDON	Oh. Oh, I see. Now I'm the master of... 'mechanical stuff.' As opposed to five minutes ago, when I was trying to collect my thoughts and figure out a way to get us out of these contraptions! But no!
M	GORDON	-- That wouldn't have been any fun for a certain somebody, and I won't mention any names -- Jim West! -- who decided to take me on a bracing romp through a cornfield and play a fanciful game of hide and seek with serrated, spinning death discs, while our only mode of transportation is in the hands of a sadistic madman with weapons of mass destruction, who kidnapped Rita, and is on his way to kill our President and take over the country!
M	WEST	Hey, calm down, Gordon...
M	GORDON	No! Because I'm the 'Master of Mechanical Stuff!' And I have to help YOU! Because you're the 'Master of Stupid Stuff!'
M	WEST	Gordon...
M	GORDON	You want to get that collar off? Fine! Let's do it the fun, Jim West way! Let's bash it with a rock!
M	WEST	Gordon, you don't want to do that.
M	GORDON	Oh, but I do.
M	GORDON	That's odd. What did you do?
M	WEST	I didn't do shit!
M	GORDON	No, you must've reversed the polarity of the magnets.
M	WEST	I did not do shit! That's it --
M	GORDON	Are you all right?
M	WEST	Oh, I'm peachey. Now help me get my boot off!
M	WEST	Ahhhh!
M	GORDON	Apologies, apologies.
M	WEST	Do me a favor. When you're telling this story to your grandkids, leave this part out.
M	GORDON	Don't worry.
M	WEST	Now, when I undo your belt, I'm going to run as fast as I can that way, and you run as fast as you can the other way. Understand?
M	GORDON	You're going to run as fast as you can one way and I'm going to run as fast as I can the other...? Ingenious.
M	WEST	One... two... Three!
M	WEST	Get off me, you steaming pile of
M	GORDON	I'm trying, you son of a (GURGLE)!
M	WEST	
M	GORDON	(rolling face upGURGLE) yourself!
M	WEST	I do not want to spend the rest of my life looking like a meatball on a plate.
M	GORDON	We're going to have to discuss bathroom etiquette soon. Very soon.
M	GORDON	Aha. My auxiliary tool kit. I forgot all about it. It must've slipped out of my pocket.
M	WEST	Your pocket? Why wasn't it attached to some spring-loaded something-or-other that shoots out of your ass?
M	GORDON	Because that, my friend, would be uncomfortable.
M	WEST	Why didn't you tell me you had an 'auxiliary' tool kit?
M	GORDON	I did tell you, but in your zeal to run and leap off a two-hundred- foot cliff, I don't think you heard me.
M	WEST	What?!
M	GORDON	'... Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them, And show the heavens more just.'
M	GORDON	What?!
M	WEST	You know, Gordon, you can be quite annoying -- flaunting that fancy education.
M	GORDON	Well, truth be told, I never had a fancy education -- not a formal one, anyway.
M	WEST	The Harvard thing seems pretty formal to me.
M	GORDON	This ring? This ring isn't real. Do you want it?
M	GORDON (CONT'D)	A prop. I'm an actor. Or was. I gave it up. I went by the name of Arthur Gordon. Ever hear of me?
M	WEST	No. How did you wind up in this line of work?
M	GORDON	The pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of Our American Cousin -- a light comedy -- at Ford's Theater in Washington. There was this one line I had... always got the biggest laugh in the show. One night, it drowned out the gunshot that killed President Lincoln. I decided to devote my talents to making sure that never happened again.
M	GORDON	Uh... There's a spider on your hand. Doesn't that bother you?
M	WEST	She doesn't want any trouble. She's just trying to get warm.
M	GORDON	How come you know so much about the desert, anyway?
M	WEST	The Indians taught me. I lived out here when I was a boy.
M	WEST	Hey -- watch --
M	WEST	The desert wasp... one of the world's great hunters. She'll kill the tarantula -- and lay her eggs on it, so her babies can have something to eat.
M	GORDON	Now I'm really hungry. How did your parents, who I assume were Negroes, feel about you being raised by Indians?
M	WEST	They didn't have much to say about it. I was sent to another plantation when I was little. Ran away as soon as my legs were strong enough to take me.
M	GORDON	Did you ever see your family again?
M	WEST	Yeah... They were at the camp at New Liberty.
M	GORDON	I'll help you get him, Jim.
M	GORDON	You have no idea where you're going, do you?
M	WEST	I know exactly where I'm goin' ... Spider Canyon.
M	WEST	But I'm never gonna get there with you draggin' that damn thing around!
M	GORDON	While a magneto of this power may not inspire your scientific curiosity, it does mine. Besides, you never know when it might come in handy.
M	WEST	Arte... when you're right, you're right.
M	GORDON	Well I think our partnership is taking a big step forward. You finally admitted I was right about something.
M	GORDON	Now... how about admitting you were lost?
M	WEST	Don't push it.
M	GORDON	Jim, I know I've hallucinated it several times before, so is that really the Wanderer?
M	WEST	That's the Wanderer.
M	GORDON	And would it be too much to hope that I'm simply seeing a World's Fair down there... ?
M	WEST	Yeah, it would. That's Loveless' Lair.
M	GORDON	Now that's impressive.
M	WEST	Nice to see an invention that actually works.
M	GORDON	We'll see about that. The fool doesn't even realize he's trapped.
M	WEST	Gordon, let's ride! You do know how to ride...?
M	WEST	... A horse, I mean.
M	GORDON	Yes... I know how to ride a horse. When the situation calls for something primitive.
M	WEST	How about now? There's a big spider stompin' towards our President!
M	GORDON	I was just thinking about another spider. Remember in the desert, when that little wasp killed the tarantula...?
M	WEST	Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small advantage. It could fly.
M	GORDON	Exactly!
M	GORDON	In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci invented a flying machine called the 'Ornithopter.' Though he never actually flew it...
M	WEST	Artemus! There's no time for plans or half-cocked inventions! They don't work. We gotta stick to what we're each good at!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)	May God continue the unity of our country...
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	... as this railroad unites the two great oceans of this world. distance in seconds.
M	LOVELESS	Well, isn't this a coincidence! I'm out for a little mornin' ride, and right in the middle of nowhere, I bump into General Ulysses S. Grant himself! We've never been properly introduced. I'm Dr. Arliss Loveless, formerly with the Confederate Army.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Yes, Dr. Loveless, what can I do for you today? Flank him, left and right.
M	LOVELESS	I have a humble abode nearby, and I hope you'll accept my hospitality. I have a little proposition to make.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	What proposition is that?
M	LOVELESS	The unconditional and immediate surrender of the United States of America to the Loveless Alliance.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I didn't realize we were at war.
M	LOVELESS	How about now...?
M	GORDON/GRANT	In matters of war, the person to talk to would be me. Love-lettes and everyone else aboard.
M	LOVELESS	Now just who are you?
M	GORDON/GRANT	The President. He's just an actor hired to stand in for me on public occasions. A very bad actor, I must say... a little puffy and overweight.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Gordon, you've got a lot of brass. Where's West?
M	GORDON	You know him, sir...
M	GORDON/GRANT	Captain, get this man out of my sight! And next time get me a real actor!
M	LOVELESS	Take them both!!!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Well, Gordon... was this part of your plan?
M	GORDON	I'm by your side, sir. That's what's important.
M	OMITTED 168	
M	LOVELESS	Bonjour, buenas tardes and good day! Great glorious day! A day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all!
M	LOVELESS	... Oh, how long have we waited! Coleman.
M	LOVELESS	... 1776, wasn't it, old bean? Most expensive cup o' tea in history...!
M	LOVELESS	Manhattan for a handful of beads? How? Remember the Alamo indeed! Today I'm proud to be able to sit before you and tell you the wrongs will be righted... the past made present... the United, divided!
M	LOVELESS	Great Britain gets back the thirteen original colonies... minus Manhattan. Florida and the Fountain of Youth go back to Spain! Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona revolve a Mexico! And the Louisiana Purchase reverts back to the King of France!
F	RITA	Queen of Spain. King of France. I was close.
M	MUNITIA	Shut up and listen to a real genius!
M	LOVELESS	And a tiny piece for me to retire on.
M	LOVELESS	My partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible. Personally, I like the symmetry of it. After all wasn't it you who made us sign a surrender at Appomattox?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Never will I sign that paper, never will the United States ever surrender!
M	LOVELESS	Well, sir, we're at loggerheads then, aren't we? And I suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record, would mean nothing.
M	LOVELESS	... so, if you still refuse to sign this surrender... we'll start by shooting your man, Gordon.
F	RITA	Artemus!
M	GORDON	Don't worry, I'm wearing the Impermeable.
M	GORDON	If I may have one request... it's that she aim at my heart... which has loved this great country so much!
M	LOVELESS	Shoot him in the head.
M	GORDON	Great.
M	CHANTEUSE	'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump and rosy...' She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way. About
M	CHANTEUSE	'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'
M	LOVELESS	A new girl! What a nice surprise!
M	CHANTEUSE	'Painted cheeks and frilly corsets.' Touch them...'
M	CHANTEUSE	'... And they'll sting like hornets!'
M	LOVELESS	Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to me?
M	GORDON	I have a dress like that.
M	CHANTEUSE	'Hangtown gals are lovely creatures Think they'll marry Mormon preachers.'
M	CHANTEUSE	'Heads thrown back to show their features...'
M	COLEMAN	Go, Ebonia, go.
M	WEST	Ha... Ha... Hangtown girls...
M	GORDON	Not to sound ungrateful, but you're a little over the top.
M	WEST	Ha... Ha... Ha...
M	GORDON	Let me warn you about that dress...
M	WEST	Gotta go. Big finish... 'Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown gals!!!'
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Where'd those come from...?
M	COLEMAN	Captain West.
F	RITA	She's... no...!
M	WEST	'Ha, ha, ha... Hang... Town... Girls!!!'
M	WEST	Wait a minute. What the hell is this?
F	RITA	Serves you right for staring at them.
M	LOVELESS	Kill him! Him! Him! The girl!
M	GORDON	Was that the eight ball?
M	WEST	Mmm-hmm.
M	GORDON	That one's an incendiary bomb.
M	WEST/GORDON	Rita!
F	RITA	Meet me after the show!
M	COLEMAN	Special Marshal... President thought you needed some lookin' after.
M	FRENCH MINISTER	Monsieur, we are your partners! You can't let us die in this fire!!
M	LOVELESS	It's not the first time y'all have been burned in America.
M	COLEMAN	This is diabolical! They've got the President and I've still got that silly song in my head!
M	GORDON	C'mon we gotta go! We gotta ride horse! Something!
M	WEST	No, Arte. Right now, we need a plan.
M	WEST	That flyin' machine idea of yours... were you just acting like you knew what you were talking about... or could you build it?
M	GORDON (O.S.)	Now Bernoulli's Principle states that the air flowing over a bird's wings... is moving at a lower pressure than the pressure below the wing... that's called 'lift.' Course, it's just a theory... it's never been tested. that. Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing
M	WEST	You're not makin' me feel any better. spaceship. He passes them out.
M	COLEMAN	Here's a coupla bon voyage presents.
M	GORDON	Coleman! Must you smoke when handling explosives!
M	WEST	He's just a little nervous 'cause no one's ever flown before.
M	WEST	Avant...! Avant!!!
M	GORDON	We're not getting enough lift! We need more speed!
M	WEST	Hey, uh... that's the cliff over there, you know?
M	GORDON	Yes, I do know.
M	GORDON	It worked...? It worked!!
M	WEST	If you had to get one right, I'm real glad it was this one.
M	GORDON	Yeee-haaa!
M	LOVELESS	Mr. President, I'll ask you once again. Sign the surrender or I decimate this town!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	You've had my answer.
M	LOVELESS	I find the sound of people screaming while they get blown to smithereens, ruins the ear for music. Don't you?
M	LOVELESS	Commence firing!
M	GORDON	I think I'll call it...
M	WEST	Lemme guess... an Elevation Enhancer?
M	GORDON	No, Air... Gordon.
M	WEST	Go down, down there!
M	GORDON	You can't just 'go down there.' Flight depends on lift, which must be calibrated to the angle of descent...
M	WEST	Shut up and go down there, will ya?
M	LOVELESS	Well, Mr. President. Have you had enough yet? Would you like to sign the surrender or shall we set a course for Denver? Wichita? Washington, perhaps?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Well, I'll be damned... it's West and Gordon... flying!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Keep that surrender handy. I think you're going to need it!
M	LOVELESS	Don't be too sure...
M	LOVELESS	I'm through with diplomacy... Take him away and kill him!
M	WEST	What does your boy da Vinci say about puttin' this bird down?
M	GORDON	I don't think he thought it would ever work, so he didn't get that far. I'm open to suggestions.
M	WEST	Take out as many bad guys out as you can. deck, to her death.
M	LOVELESS	Munitia! Munitia!!!
M	GORDON	Sorry about that, sir. Nose up, flaps down. Have to remember that next time.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Son, never apologize for saving a President's life. Soon you all can fly again. This time with little angel wings.
M	LOVELESS	Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity. Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me... and forego your executions.
M	WEST	Why not? Well, I guess maybe I'd rather see what happens when I stuff your ass into that cannon up there and fertilize the landscape.
M	GORDON	Uh, Jim, I think a polite 'no' would suffice...
M	LOVELESS	Lippenreider, take over the controls. We may not have a woodshed on board, but that boy is gonna get a whoopin' anyway!
M	WEST	So, I guess you're the one who's gonna give me my whoopin'.
M	WEST	Pfft. I got one a' those.
M	WEST	But you've got two of those. Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll see if he can...
M	WEST	Damn.
M	WEST	No more Mister Knife guy!
M	SHOVEL GUY	I learned that from a Chinaman.
M	WEST	I just made that up.
M	WEST	Don't forget your shovel!
M	WEST	Is that all you got for me, Loveless?!
M	WEST	Uh, I just threw my shovel out. So this really isn't fair. If you don't mind, I'd like to...
M	WEST	Noooo.
M	WEST	Sorry.
M	METAL HEAD	Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh!!!
M	WEST	You guys just don't get out enough.
M	WEST	When you get right down to it, Loveless, you just can't beat a good pair of legs.
M	LOVELESS	You're obviously not a poker player, Mr. West...
M	LOVELESS	Two pair always beats a pair.
M	LOVELESS	Now... Was it someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action?
M	LOVELESS	Hmmm. Well, that hit a nerve. sprawling.
M	LOVELESS	A mother, perhaps? A father? helplessly as...
M	LOVELESS	It feels so good to stretch my legs.
M	LOVELESS	I likes to beat my feet on the Mississippi mud!
M	GORDON	Stop this violence!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Drop 'em.
M	GORDON (O.S.)	Stop or I'll shoot!
M	LOVELESS	You expect to kill me with that little pea shooter?
M	GORDON	If I have to. Yes.
M	LOVELESS	Why is it, that I'm unafraid? I believe you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and I'm stuck in the middle. On one end, we have Mr. West, a man of primitive vigours uncomplicated by intellect. And on the other, there's Mr. Gordon. A man of ideas, but unlike myself, lacks the passion to kill for them. He'd like to be able to act his way out of it. And for some reason when he's actin', someone always seems to get killed.
M	WEST	Shoot him, Gordon...!
M	LOVELESS	I'm right about you, aren't I, Gordon? And that's why I'm gonna kill your friend here. Then I'm going to kill you.
M	LOVELESS	After all that, you missed.
M	GORDON	Not exactly.
M	WEST	Better than a fountain pen, don't you think. By the way, your chivalry's about to be tested. retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would "bye-bye."
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	We'll be joining them in a moment if you can't stop that thing!
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Let's see how clever you really are...
M	WEST	For almost four long years I've been trackin' the animal responsible for the Massacre at New Liberty. And I hear that's you...
M	LOVELESS	Please, West... show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple...
M	WEST	Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just buck up and say to yourself, 'I am indefatigably hard-pumpin' and steely!'
M	LOVELESS	After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna boil you down to axle grease!
M	WEST	Now that's the ol' doctor I know! Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack
M	LOVELESS	Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. How did we arrive in this dark situation?
M	WEST	I don't know. Guess I'm stumped!
M	LOVELESS	And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid of heights. They just give me the spooks!
M	WEST	Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless. With this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something.
M	LOVELESS	Mister West, I'm gonna cut this conversation short...
M	WEST	Good one, Loveless. I didn't think of that one.
M	LOVELESS	Mister West!!! I am faced with a difficult decision here. On one hand, there is the overwhelming love that I have for myself, and on the other, the raw, seething hatred I have for you! Now, I could kill you very easily, just by pulling this lever...
M	LOVELESS	But, of course, I would die along with you. I guess the only thing that I can take comfort in is the hope that you would hit those rocks a second before me and I could enjoy immeasurable bliss before I vanish. What to do, what to do...
M	WEST	Allow me to make that decision easy on you, Loveless. Because I want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than I want to live.
M	LOVELESS	Why is it that I have a sneaking suspicion, that although you are as black as the night on the outside... inside, you are yellow?!
M	LOVELESS	You don't have it in you, do you... boy?!
M	WEST	You were right. Let's cut this conversation short!
M	LOVELESS	Weeeeeeeeeest!!!!
M	WEST	Now that looked like it hurt.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Gentlemen, I now strongly believe the United States is going to be truly united. Not because of this railroad... but because of you.
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I've signed into law the creation of an agency whose sole duty is to protect the President and the country from lunatics like Loveless. Welcome to the Secret Service, Agents No. 1 and No. 2.
M	GORDON	Uh, just out of curiosity, sir... who's Agent No. 1?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	I don't think that matters very much, do you? Gordon? Besides, you'll have plenty of time to discuss it on your new assignment. See you back in Washington.
M	GORDON	But, sir... what about our train?
M	PRESIDENT GRANT	Well, I'm taking it of course. Hell, you let Loveless blow up mine.
M	RITA (O.S.)	Jim... Arte...? in a print dress and parasol.
M	WEST	Rita! You look great.
M	GORDON	Ravishing, a vision.
F	RITA	I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me... before I went back home to Texas.
M	WEST	Texas? Why're you going back there? Why don't you come with me back to Washington?
M	GORDON	Or better still, come with me to Washington. I could introduce you to people I still know in the theater...
M	WEST	She's not really an entertainer, remember?
F	RITA	I can't go with either of you.
F	RITA	It's not that you both don't have your attributes. You're so sophisticated and such a wonderful cook. Jim, you're good with a gun... and have great legs. And you're both so brave. But... I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you.
M	WEST AND GORDON	Uh-oh...
F	RITA	Professor Escobar's not my father. He's my husband.
M	WEST	Rita... why didn't you just tell us that in the first place?
F	RITA	Well, I was going to... but would you have really brought me along if I said I was married? Honestly.
F	RITA	I didn't think so.
F	RITA	At least you still have each other. You know, Arte... What's that, Jim?
M	WEST (O.S.)	Maybe Rita's right...
M	WEST	Besides... there's a lot of other women in the world.
M	GORDON	That's easy for you to say. She didn't walk off with your best dress.
