M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Year after year, twenty-something women come to New York City in search of the two "L's": labels and love.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Twenty years ago... I was one of them.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Having gotten the knack for labels early... I concentrated on my search for love. Turns out, a "knock-off" is not as easy to spot when comes to love...
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Until it is.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	That is why you need help to spot them... ... Lots of help. Year after year, my single girlfriends were my salvation. And, as it turns out... ... My meal ticket.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	We still are those four single girls...
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Even though, technically... we're not.
M	CARRIE (V.O)	One of us is married...
M	CARRIE (V.O)	One of us... married, divorced and re-married... One of us... relocated.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And... one of us stayed exactly where she was.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	In love.
M	BIG	I got a good feeling about this one, kid.
F	CARRIE	I've always loved this block.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Finding the perfect apartment in New York City is like finding the perfect partner. It can take years.
M	BIG	How many does this make?
F	CARRIE	This is thirty-three.
M	BIG	Lucky thirty-three!
M	CAROL	The worst. I just left you a message.
F	CARRIE	Thirty-four. Lucky thirty-four?
F	CARRIE	If anything else opens up let us know. We're very interested in this building.
M	AGENT	I do have another apartment that's not even on the market yet. Care to take a look?
M	CARRIE/BIG	Sure.
M	AGENT	It's more than you were looking to pay.
M	CAROL	How much more?
M	AGENT	More.
M	BIG	Oh, so this is where they keep the light.
F	CARRIE	Oh my God. I've died and gone to real estate heaven. Look at this place.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Hellooo, I live here.
M	BIG	Must be the altitude.
M	AGENT	And across the rooftop terrace ---
F	CARRIE	What -- Nirvana?
M	AGENT	Your wife has quite a sense of humor.
M	CAROL	They're not married.
F	CARRIE	No, he's my boyfriend.
M	AGENT	This way.
M	BIG	Aren't I a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend?
F	CARRIE	Point taken. From now on... you'll be my man friend.
M	BIG	Sounds like a dog.
F	CARRIE	Well, if the shoe fits.
M	AGENT	And this is the master bedroom.
F	CARRIE	Hideous. Hate it. Hurts my eyes.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	How is this place even available?
M	AGENT	Nasty divorce.
F	CARRIE	If you live here what is there to fight about?
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	This is the master closet? No.
M	AGENT	Yes. Small for a room this size. I know.
F	CARRIE	Hmmm. Hmmm. Now, I understand the divorce.
M	BIG	I can build you a better closet.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Welcome home, baby.
F	CARRIE	Can we afford this?
M	BIG	I got it.
F	CARRIE	"I got it." Just like that. "I got it" -- like he was picking up the check for coffee or something.
F	CHARLOTTE	It sounds perfect.
F	CARRIE	Except for the closet which Big says he can redo -- also he says the kitchen needs work but I don't know about that `cause I keep sweaters in my stove.
F	MIRANDA	So, he bought it -- and you're going to live there with him?
F	CARRIE	Yes, together. That's right.
F	MIRANDA	But he'll own it. So. You are keeping your own place, right?
F	CARRIE	Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with.
F	MIRANDA	I just want to make sure you're being smart here --
F	CARRIE	And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel. Jealous. Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.
F	MIRANDA	Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.
F	CHARLOTTE	New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.
F	MIRANDA	Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn.
F	CARRIE	There she is. Hey Hollywood!
F	SAMANTHA	Samantha Jones... Smith Jerrod's manager -- I'm in New York `till Monday.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	How was your flight?
F	SAMANTHA	Fabulous. Let's go in -- I am so excited!
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	It was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together. The socialites, the trendies the yuppies, the yentas.
M	YENTA	Why the pushing? Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And now she was getting the ultimate break-up revenge. An embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy.
F	SAMANTHA	There it is. My baby.
M	CARRIE/BIG	And she's a beauty.
F	SAMANTHA	When I saw this in the catalogue I said to Smith: This flower ring is the essence of me. One of a kind, filled with fire...
F	CARRIE	And a little too much.
F	SAMANTHA	Exactly. Come on. Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money.
F	MIRANDA	Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's series? Is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon?
F	SAMANTHA	He sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital.
F	MIRANDA	Great. Can't wait.
F	CHARLOTTE	Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women?
F	SAMANTHA	No, I think it's hot. Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them.
F	CARRIE	And people say the golden age of television is over.
F	SAMANTHA	Besides, it's fake sex. When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on.
F	MIRANDA	Kinda like Steve and I.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	I'm kidding. But come one-- it's been seven years. He does that, I do this... It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up.
M	AUCTIONEER	Next item. The flower ring.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	If Schadenfreude is the word for feeling pleasure at someone else misfortune -- This was "jewelryfreude."
M	AUCTIONEER	Let's start the bidding at ten thousand.
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Thank you madame. Do I hear fifteen?
F	SAMANTHA	Bitch.
F	CARRIE	And the gloves are off.
M	AUCTIONEER	Do I hear twenty?
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Twenty. Do I hear twenty-five?
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Twenty-five. Thirty?
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Thirty-five?
F	MIRANDA	She's bidding for someone on the phone.
F	CHARLOTTE	That's not fair.
M	AUCTIONEER	Thirty-five. Forty?
F	SAMANTHA	I deserve this. I work hard.
M	AUCTIONEER	Do I hear forty?
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Do I hear forty fi--
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Fifty?
F	SAMANTHA	Sex with only one man for I don't know how long.
M	AUCTIONEER	Do I hear fifty thousand?
F	SAMANTHA	Fifty fucking thousand!
M	AUCTIONEER	Fifty-five?
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Sixty? Sixty to our colorful bidder?
F	SAMANTHA	I draw the line at fifty.
F	CHARLOTTE	I thought this auction would be more fun... but it's kinda sad.
M	BABY VOICED WOMAN	Isn't it?
M	BABY VOICED WOMAN (CONT'D)	I thought it was just sad for me `cause I know her. But it's really sad, huh? And it's funny cause they were so happy.
F	SAMANTHA	... Till they weren't
M	BABY VOICED WOMAN	I know, right? We all told her to get married -- but she didn't want to push him. He'd been married three other times. So, she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out. She didn't even have anywhere to live. After ten years. Such a shame. She was a smart girl till she fell in love.
M	BIG	The creatures are ready. Just gonna sit there?
F	CARRIE	I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.
M	BIG	Here. Husk and think.
F	CARRIE	I'm thinking I'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on Fifth.
M	BIG	Why? You love your place.
F	CARRIE	I know but --
M	BIG	But what?
F	CARRIE	We're together ever night -- so I'm basically paying a mortgage on a glorified closet.
M	BIG	You write there. It's your office.
F	CARRIE	There's plenty of room at the new place and -- besides.. I want to make us -- a life there. I want it to be ours.
M	BIG	It is ours. I bought it for us.
F	CARRIE	And that's so amazing --but you bought it, so it's really your place. And -- if anything were to happen...
M	BIG	What's going to happen?
F	CARRIE	I have to be smart here. I mean, we're not married and I'd have no legal rights to... this home that I built... with you.
M	BIG	Did you want to get married?
F	CARRIE	I didn't think it was an option.
M	BIG	Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was an option?
F	CARRIE	Well, people are always assuming we are.
M	BIG	And you know what happens when people assume. They make an ass out of who?
F	CARRIE	You and me.
M	BIG	What do you think, kid?
F	CARRIE	Why -- Do you want to get married?
M	BIG	Well, I wouldn't mind be married to you. Would you mind being married to me?
F	CARRIE	No, if that's what you want. Is that what you want?
M	BIG	I want you. So. Okay.
F	CARRIE	Okay. Really? We're getting married.
M	BIG	We're getting married. Should we get you a diamond?
F	CARRIE	No, please, don't get me a diamond. Get me a really big closet.
M	BIG	Deal. But... You gotta do better on that corn. Look at all the stuff left on there.
F	CARRIE	So, the other night, Big and I were talking about, you know, moving in together and our future... ... And about what makes sense as we move forward. And, well... we decided to get married.
F	MIRANDA	... and I'm deaf.
F	CARRIE	Everyone's looking
F	CHARLOTTE	Sorry! I'm sorry... but my friend here, just got engaged and she's been going out with the man for ten years.
F	CARRIE	I am mortified.
F	MIRANDA	There is literally a ringing in my ear. Samantha Jones--
F	CARRIE	Well... I made a little decision that I hope you'll be happy about.
F	SAMANTHA	Oh, honey... you finally got Botox.
F	CARRIE	No. I did not get Botox
F	SAMANTHA	I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll love it.
F	CARRIE	I did not call to talk about Botox.
F	SAMANTHA	I'm just saying.
F	CARRIE	So... Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options.
F	SAMANTHA	Right.
F	CARRIE	Right, and... well, Big and I decided to get married.
F	SAMANTHA	Really?
F	CARRIE	Yes.
F	SAMANTHA	That's great.
F	CARRIE	You sounded more excited about the botox.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, honey -- I am excited for you but -- you know me... I don't really believe in marriage.... Botox on the other hand -- That works every time.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	Honey, I've got to go. The People magazine person is on hold. Smith's on the short list to be their "Sexiest Man Alive." We can catch up when I'm in town next week.
F	CARRIE	Hello?
F	SAMANTHA	I think I was in shock. I mean, it's you getting married. This is not some random person -- it's you.
F	CARRIE	I hear ya.
F	SAMANTHA	And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan -- you'd never want to get married.
F	CARRIE	I know.
F	SAMANTHA	So, I put you in my "we're never getting married" file. Now, I've got to take you out of that file.
F	CARRIE	Sorry about the extra paper work.
F	SAMANTHA	You'll get my bill.
F	CARRIE	Samantha, it feels so different this time. No cliché romantic kneeling down on one knee. Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, I'm happy for you.
F	CARRIE	And one more thing... I want you to be maid of honor. How do you feel about that?
F	SAMANTHA	The same way you feel about Botox. Painful and unnecessary.
F	CHARLOTTE	74, 75, 76.... Seventy-six guests.
M	ANTHONY	Seventy five sounds better. "A small, wedding of seventy five guests."
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	As a wedding gift, Charlotte had given me Anthony Marantino -- friend and wedding planner.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	What? She was borderline anyway.
M	ANTHONY	Cut throat -- I love it. I hope you're that decisive when it comes to the location and the dress.
F	CARRIE	Oh. I found the dress.
F	CHARLOTTE	What?! When?
F	CARRIE	The other day. I have it here.
M	ANTHONY	This is going to be good!
F	CHARLOTTE	I'm so excited!
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Here it is.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Well... that was the exact reaction I was aiming for.
F	CHARLOTTE	No, it's pretty but it's so -- simple.
F	CARRIE	Simple and classic. When I saw it I just thought: That is what I should marry Big in.
M	ANTHONY	Well, who's it by? The label?
F	CARRIE	No one. I found it in a vintage shop.
M	ANTHONY	"The bride wore a dress by no one."
F	CARRIE	Don't worry, I'll style it up with shoes.
M	ANTHONY	The invitation is fancier than the dress. I heard that.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And from Anthony Marantino to spaghetti marinara.
F	MIRANDA	Where is he with the check?
M	STEVE	Geese, Miranda -- relax. Magda's not even finished yet.
F	MIRANDA	I still have a legal brief to work on when I get home.
M	BRADY	I have to go to the bathroom.
F	MAGDA	I'll take him. Wash that beautiful face too, yes?
F	MIRANDA	What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. Brady woke me up at five AM. He woke me up too.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	You got milk on your top lip.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	What now?
F	MIRANDA	It's like you're always criticizing me.
M	STEVE	I am not. You want to go through life with foam on your lip and no one telling you?
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Anything you want to tell me?
F	MIRANDA	Yeah. Yeah.
M	STEVE	Wait --- wait -- Don't come already...
F	MIRANDA	Yeah. Yeah.
M	STEVE	Wait, wait -- get on top. Get on --
F	MIRANDA	It's late... let's just get it over with.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	I mean -- We have to get up in four and half hours.
M	STEVE	We never have sex and you want to get it over with?
F	MIRANDA	Steve... We have sex.
M	STEVE	When was the last time we had sex?
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	There was snow on the ground.
F	MIRANDA	How often do you guys have sex?
F	CHARLOTTE	Miranda -- please.
F	MIRANDA	What?
F	CARRIE	It's okay, I know all about sex.
F	SAMANTHA	If I knew the girl talk was going to be on "lock down," I wouldn't have flown two thousand miles.
F	CHARLOTTE	No, we can talk, let's just not use that word.
F	MIRANDA	She's three, she doesn't know what it means. I'm forty- two and I still don't know what it means.
F	CHARLOTTE	I know, but she's repeating everything.
F	MIRANDA	Fine. How often do you guys...
F	CARRIE	... "Color"?
F	CHARLOTTE	Thank-you.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, I can't color enough. I would color all day -- every day if I had my way. I'd use every crayon in my box.
F	CARRIE	We get it. You love to color. Why are you asking?
F	MIRANDA	Steve and I were "coloring" last night and just as I was about to --
F	SAMANTHA	Come? Sorry -- there is no crayon equivalent.
F	MIRANDA	He wanted to change positions and I said... "Let's just get it over with." Well, he kept trying to make it last longer.
F	SAMANTHA	And this is bad?
F	MIRANDA	It is when you have a full-time job.
F	SAMANTHA	I have a full-time job.
F	MIRANDA	Well, you don't also have a five year old and play groups and PTA and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing Alzheimer's. I'm telling you, at the end of the day all I want to do is sleep. The most exciting thing in bed now -- is the bed.
F	CARRIE	So... Sleep is the new sex?
F	LILY	Sex.
F	CHARLOTTE	See.
F	CARRIE	-- I meant coloring.
F	MIRANDA	We're just going through a no coloring phase -- it comes and goes, right?
F	CHARLOTTE	Every couple is different. Harry and I --
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	... Make love two or three times a week.
F	MIRANDA	Great. Now I feel worse.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, when was the last time for you?
F	MIRANDA	Six months ago.
F	CARRIE	Oh my.
F	MIRANDA	But that's a dry spell.
F	SAMANTHA	I bet it is.
F	CHARLOTTE	What about you and Big, Carrie? Come on, I told.
F	CARRIE	Never. But, I will tell you this. When Big colors -- He rarely stays inside the lines.
F	MIRANDA	Well, this was very helpful.
F	SAMANTHA	Send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	I've got to go. Something just came up.
M	SMITH	I've got a gift for you.
F	SAMANTHA	So far, I like it. How did -- Wait -- that was you on the phone at the auction?
M	SMITH	I knew how much you wanted it.
F	SAMANTHA	But I was going to buy it for myself.
M	SMITH	I wanted to give it to you... for our anniversary. We met five years ago today.
F	SAMANTHA	Right.
M	SMITH	Do you like it?
F	SAMANTHA	To be clear -- This is a ring with diamonds -- not a diamond ring, right? In that case... I love it. It's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	Now, my gift's a little bit more... oral.
M	SMITH	Babe -- I've got to go to bed.
F	SAMANTHA	Bed? It's seven-thirty.
M	SMITH	I have to be at the studio by six A.M. and I need to get a workout before that.
F	SAMANTHA	This is how it starts. Next thing you know... we're only having sex three or four times a week.
M	SMITH	Most people consider that normal.
F	SAMANTHA	I am not most people.
M	SMITH	No - you most certainly are not.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	One glass of Merlot and two orgasms later.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	And that is how Samantha learned she had a new neighbor.
F	CARRIE	John?
F	CARRIE	Lean?
M	BIG	Are you the last person in New York still taking out library books?
F	CARRIE	I love the smell.
M	BIG	That's an old one.
F	CARRIE	"The Love Letters of Great Men." Volume one.
M	BIG	Am I in there?
F	CARRIE	No, but some of your classmates are. Voltaire, Napoleon...
M	BIG	You need to get glasses.
F	CARRIE	No, I don't -- you have them. Here's Napoleon... "My dearest Josephine, I wake consumed with thoughts of you --"
M	BIG	Typical short guy. Gives it all away up front.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Why are you reading this?
F	CARRIE	Research for my new book.
M	BIG	What's it about?
F	CARRIE	Love. I use to write about finding love-- now I want to write about what happens after you've found it.
M	BIG	Interesting. What happens?
F	CARRIE	Stay tuned.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Listen... Here's Beethoven.
M	BIG	Bring it, Ludwig.
F	CARRIE	"My thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved. I can live only wholly with you or not at all."
M	BIG	Good stuff.
F	CARRIE	"Be calm my life, my all. Only by calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together. Oh continue to love me, never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved. Ever thine -- ever mine -- ever ours.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Have you ever written me a love letter?
M	BIG	Does a love fax count?
F	CARRIE	When have I ever gotten a love fax?
M	BIG	I'm pretty sure my secretary sent one at some point.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	What can I say, baby? Not my style. Besides, these guys had to write-- they were separated from their loves by wars and hundreds of miles. I'm right here.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Hi.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	You make me very happy.
F	CARRIE	Yeah, yeah.... Put it in writing.
M	BIG	Alright. Here's a love letter from me to you.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Loving you. Is easy... `cause your beautiful...
M	BIG (CONT'D)	EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE IS FILLED WITH LOVING YOU. LA LA LA LA LA LA LA OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
M	DELIVERY MAN	Which way's the wedding?
F	CARRIE	I've been thinking.
M	BIG	Again?
F	CARRIE	How about we get married at The New York Public Library? Think how perfect. You and I and our love story surrounded by all the other lesser love stories.
M	BIG	Do we have to make that big of a deal?
F	CARRIE	It's not that big a deal. It's seventy-five people in a room that's partitioned in half.
M	BIG	It's just -- I've already had two big weddings.
F	CARRIE	Well, what did you have in mind?
M	BIG	I don't know -- a judge, couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after.
F	CARRIE	Interesting.
M	BIG	Would we have to whisper? In the library?
M	BIG (CONT'D)	"Do you, Carrie" -- Shhhh. "Take this man" -- SHHHH!
M	ELAINE	Carrie, hi!
F	CARRIE	Elaine, hi. Do you know John?
M	ELAINE	No, hi. Nice to meet you.
F	CARRIE	Elaine writes a single gal column for The New York Post.
M	ELAINE	Please -- I'd rather you reveal my weight. So, what's new?
F	CARRIE	Well. We're getting married.
M	BIG	Yep -- At the New York Public Library.
M	ELAINE	Oh, my God! This gives me such hope.
M	ELAINE (CONT'D)	Thank-you. Thank-you for marrying someone our age.
F	CHARLOTTE	"The ultimate single gal Carrie Bradshaw will be married in Manolos to New York financier John James Preston come fall."
F	CARRIE	Our wedding's on Page Six.
M	BIG	Who would put that in there?
F	CHARLOTTE	"Proving to single gals everywhere that there can be a happy ending over forty."
F	CARRIE	Oh, I know who.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Later that day, I met my friend Stanford for our weekly quick lunch and gossip session... Also known as "dish then dash."
M	STANFORD	According to a certain trashy tome, you are marrying John James Preston.
F	CARRIE	Rumor has it.
M	STANFORD	Just one question: Does Big know?
F	CARRIE	Where are we eating?
M	STANFORD	Anywhere you like... and you know the rule -- the person on Page Six pays for lunch. It seemed everywhere I went... people I knew were excited and available to come to the wedding.
M	STANFORD	You forgot to charge us for the gaggle of gays.
M	BITSY	Carrie Bradshaw Preston! Carrie Bradshaw Preston!
M	BITSY (CONT'D)	Mazel tov! Saw you on Page Six! September? October? When? Look! Will you look! I got so excited -- no shoes. I'm standing barefoot on a New York sidewalk probably getting trichinoses.
M	BITSY (CONT'D)	We're at the same address -- different floor. Just send it -- they'll get us the invite.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	The shocking thing was not the plethora of empty autumn social calenders but knowledge that everyone does indeed read Page Six.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Even people you didn't expect, like my Vogue editor, Enid.
F	ENID	We're putting together our annual "Age" issue -- and we'd like you to do forty.
F	CARRIE	Great. Who am I interviewing?
F	ENID	No. You. You are forty. I want you to be featured in the magazine as the forty year old -- and here's the brilliant twist -- bride.
F	CARRIE	Wait -- I would be in the magazine?
F	ENID	In bridal couture. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity - so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes.
F	CARRIE	Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--
F	ENID	Carrie. Vogue designers, Vogue photographers, Vogue airbrushing. Nod your head: yes. Thank-you. It will be a sensation. We're calling it: "The Last Single Girl."
F	CARRIE	Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.
F	ENID	No, but forty is the last age you can see a woman photographed in a wedding gown without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext.
F	CARRIE	I thought the issue was "great style at every age."
F	ENID	Style yes... bride no.
F	CARRIE	Enid -- I have no idea -- were you ever married?
F	ENID	Briefly. In 1975. I wore Halston. Creme. One shoulder Grecian with a low-cut bodice to the waistline for a dramatic flair. The fabric in the sleeves formed oval draping on the sides. Stunning. My future husband and I saw it on a trip to Paris and he fell in love with it.
M	ENID (CONT'D)	Insisted I be married in it. So I was. We had quite a beautiful party.
F	CARRIE	Why didn't the marriage work out?
F	ENID	Did you not hear me say my husband fell in love with my gown? Has your fiancée expressed any interest in what you'll be wearing?
F	CARRIE	None at all.
F	ENID	Then you may have a shot.
F	SAMANTHA	She's looking quite at home for someone who didn't think she had the bride gene.
F	CHARLOTTE	Well, I guess with the right man...
M	STANFORD	... And the right dress. When I get married, I'm wearing something like that. But bigger.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Just your typical Wednesday. Breakfast with... Vera Wang.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Mid-morning coffee with.... Carolina Herrera.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Appetizers with Oscar de la Renta. Lunch with Lanvin... ... And Lacroix. ... And Dior. And for dessert -- Vivienne Westwood.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	A confection so special...
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	... It could wring a wedding tear from even the most unbelieving of women.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And then the impossible happened.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And just like that, Vivienne Westwood kicked my sweet little suit's ass.
M	BIG	Okay. Open them.
F	CARRIE	Double door. So far so good.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Well. You did me proud, Mister.
M	BIG	Like it?
F	CARRIE	Like it? It's love at first sight.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Now, I believe this is all really happening.
F	MIRANDA	I can't believe it sold so fast.
F	CHARLOTTE	It's a sign.
F	CARRIE	Yeah, a sign I priced it too low.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	That's the food -- money on the table. I'll get started in the closet... I should be done in seventeen years.
F	CHARLOTTE	Pink Post-it -- take. Purple -- toss. Yellow: Storage. You're good friends.
F	CHARLOTTE	Samantha! Oh my God!
F	CARRIE	What are you doing here?!
F	SAMANTHA	I lot of shit went down in this place. Attention must be payed! It took four friends, three days to put twenty years into twenty-eight boxes.
M	MARY	Who are you again?
F	MIRANDA	Oh, you know me -- I'm your daughter-in-law. I'm Miranda.
M	MARY	That's right.
F	MIRANDA	While I run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you can take him to the first birthday party alone. Then -- I'll meet you at the twins' party and you can leave and be at the bar by six.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	What's the matter? Steve.
M	STEVE	-- I had sex with someone else. -- And you are so amazing with Ma and everything... everything you do and I can't believe I would do that to you.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	You and I hadn't had sex in a really long time and I -- It didn't mean anything -- It was just once... and it's been killing me.
F	MIRANDA	It's killing you?!
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	It just happened... I wasn't thinking.
F	MIRANDA	Do not follow me.
F	CARRIE	Hi.
F	MIRANDA	Surprise -- Here we are!
F	CARRIE	Well, I'm so excited you are here for a sleepover.
F	MIRANDA	We are too. Aren't we B-boy? Here. Mommy has to go to the bathroom.
F	CARRIE	Brady, do you want to go have some peanut butter?
M	BIG	Peanut butter it is.
F	MIRANDA	Apparently you don't have sex for six months he runs out and has it with some girl at his bar.
F	CARRIE	Steve. I can't believe it. Steve.
F	MIRANDA	Steve. When I think of everything I've done for him. And this is how he repays me. Man, if I didn't have Brady, I would never go back there.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	The next night, for the sake of Brady, Miranda went against her instincts and went home.
M	STEVE	Miranda, it's still me.
F	MIRANDA	Is it?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	So Miranda left Brooklyn and came home... to Manhattan.
F	MIRANDA	Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while I look for a place. Pass the salt.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Plus, I have to be downtown and close to Brooklyn. We're going to keep things as normal for Brady as we can. I'll pick him up on my days... take him over on Steve's.
F	CARRIE	I don't know if this question is allowed -- but how is Steve handling this?
F	MIRANDA	Says he's devastated -- begs me to forgive him. Not going to happen. I can barely even look at him.
F	CHARLOTTE	Steve -- I can't believe it.
F	CARRIE	That's what I said.
F	SAMANTHA	Miranda, honey -- are you sure you want to do this? It's just one time. Anyone can have a slip.
F	MIRANDA	Well, even if I could get my head around that justification -- it's the cheating part -- the behind my back part... the violation of the trust -- that's the thing that's killing me.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Besides... women who stay with men who cheat are women who are afraid to be on their own. And that's not me -- I can handle it. Always could.
M	BRADY	Mommy, I want to go home.
F	CHARLOTTE	Thank-you for being you.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Charlotte made love to Harry five times that week.
F	SAMANTHA	It's a little quick to move out, don't you think?
M	SMITH	Her reaction is her reaction. Thanks Anaka.
F	SAMANTHA	He had sex once. Not even an affair.
M	SMITH	Maybe it's not the sex. Maybe, it's the cheating. For me... that would be the thing. That it happened behind my back.
F	SAMANTHA	That's what she said.
M	SMITH	Look. I know we're not married but - - if you were going to have sex with someone else...
F	SAMANTHA	Are you waiting for me to get out my datebook?
M	SMITH	But... seriously, I'd rather know first.
F	SAMANTHA	You want me to tell you if I'm going to have sex? Fine. I'm about to have sex.
M	SMITH	Thanks Anaka.
F	MIRANDA	I don't know if Steve's mentioned anything to you yet -- about us. Has he?
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Well -- we've had some marriage problems -- it's not necessary to go into the details but -- I just wanted you to know that we won't be coming to see you together anymore. I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and Sunday -- the other days will be Steve.
M	MARY	Who's Steve?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Miranda was starting to see the upside of Alzheimer's.
F	CARRIE	Wedding crunch time. We need to really get serious here.
M	BIG	Not now -- I just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and I have to --
F	CARRIE	Nope. Wedding before contractor. Unless you're planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one.
M	BIG	Two hundred? Jesus, Carrie -- it's gone up again?
F	CARRIE	Blame the New York Post and Vogue. Two publications that have never before been uttered in the same sentence.
M	BIG	You said: seventy-five people in a partitioned-off room.
F	CARRIE	It's the dress. How can I explain this? It's like poker -- The dress upped the ante.
M	BIG	Change the dress.
F	CARRIE	No, no, no -- you haven't seen this dress. This dress may be the whole reason to get married. Well, you and the dress.
M	CARRIE(CONT'D)	How are you coming with your vows? Just a reminder -- you are going to be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.
M	BIG	Up, up. I have to finish this. Up.
F	CARRIE	Hey...
M	BIG	I don't have time for this.
F	CARRIE	This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously.
M	BIG	No, I'm not -- It's a circus! Two hundred people -- Page Six -- This is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look?
F	CARRIE	I didn't know that was even an issue. Why didn't you say anything sooner?
M	BIG	You wanted all this.
F	CARRIE	But -- don't you want --
M	BIG	I want you, Carrie. That's what I want. I would have just gone down to city hall. I think it's too late for city hall now.
M	BIG	Well, no. I wasn't suggesting -- I was just saying.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	See. That is the face I've been trying to avoid. Come here.
F	CARRIE	You're a great man friend.
F	SAMANTHA	Now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride. But in our group --
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	... We never kiss and tell.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	So, I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
M	KARL	There's a word he's heard before!
F	CARRIE	Who is that again?
M	BIG	Karl... a partner at the firm.
F	CARRIE	Karl's kind of a jerk.
M	KARL	You know what they say -- three times a charm!
F	SAMANTHA	Hey "dick wad"... I'm speaking.
F	CARRIE	Whooo!
F	SAMANTHA	Now. There were times when we had our doubt about this gorgeous man. But after careful observation over the last hundred years, my doubts are over. So... here's to the groom. A man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.
M	KARL	Here's hopin', John!
F	CARRIE	Jackass.
M	BIG	Quite a toast, Samantha.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, you're quite a guy.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	Steve.
M	STEVE	I don't want to bother you all --
M	BIG	You're not bothering us.
M	STEVE	But --- I need to talk to Miranda. Samantha, could you -- ask her to come out. I don't want to go in. It's a party and all.
F	MIRANDA	Hi. I haven't talked to you all night.
F	SAMANTHA	Steve's here.
F	MIRANDA	Could you give us --
M	STEVE	You didn't leave me any choice. You won't return my calls -- You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know I can't say anything.
F	MIRANDA	What could you possibly have to say that could make it better?
M	STEVE	Miranda, please... It was just that one time. Please -- I love you --
F	MIRANDA	You broke us! You broke us. What we had is broken!
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	I changed who I was for you.
M	BIG	Hey. Are you alright?
F	MIRANDA	No, I'm not alright. You two are crazy to get married. Marriage ruins everything.
F	CARRIE	There you are. I thought you skipped out on me.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Well, the all-gal sleepover is about to commence. You gonna miss me?
M	BIG	Don't go. Spend the night with me.
F	CARRIE	Oh... One night won't kill you. And tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Is everything okay?
M	BIG	I'm just tired -- I guess.
F	CARRIE	Go home and sleep. Now, give me a kiss good night. Make it good -- it's the last single girl kiss.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	There we sat... like a scene out of Louisa May Alcott's: "Not-so Little Women."
F	CHARLOTTE	I always knew she would marry Big. You did not!
F	CHARLOTTE	Yes I did! After every break-up I secretly thought: Nope. They belong together.
F	SAMANTHA	You thought that after the second break-up?
F	CHARLOTTE	Yep.
F	MIRANDA	After the fifteenth?
F	CARRIE	Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a lot.
F	SAMANTHA	Yes, but... after the break-ups -- comes the hot make-up sex.
F	CARRIE	You want to answer? Go ahead, sweetie... Open it up...
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Say something.
F	LILY	Sex.
F	CARRIE	Sweetie, that was your first bootie call.
F	SAMANTHA	Are you sure she's not my child?
F	CARRIE	Hello?
M	BIG	It's me.
F	CARRIE	Oh my God -- did you just hear Lily?
M	BIG	Hey -- I need to talk.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and... Is this something we really want to do?
F	CARRIE	It's Big. I'm gonna take it in the--
F	CHARLOTTE	Get some sleep, groomie!
F	CARRIE	What's the matter?
M	BIG	It's just -- everything is great as it is. I don't want to screw it up.
F	CARRIE	You won't.
M	BIG	I screwed it up twice before.
F	CARRIE	Here's the thing. This is me that you're marrying tomorrow. Me. Nobody else.
M	BIG	Yeah.
F	CARRIE	And I'm marrying you. It's me and you. And you want to know the good news there?
M	BIG	Yeah.
F	CARRIE	We've already both done everything we can to screw it up.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Is that a smile I'm hearing?
M	BIG	Yeah.
F	CARRIE	Now, it sounds to me like you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front.
M	BIG	Yeah.
F	CARRIE	And I find - you know - as a professional writer- it's best to just, you know, stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed. And in the morning...
M	BIG	You know what to do?
F	CARRIE	Exactly. And if not -- Just write this: "I will love you." Simple and to-the-point. And I swear I won't even try to take credit for it.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	You're going to bed now, right?
M	BIG	Okay. Good night.
F	CARRIE	I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Me and you.
F	CARRIE	There you are! Almost lost you under all that. Got your purse?
M	ANTHONY	Now there's a bride! Flowers!
F	CARRIE	Whose got a mirror?
F	CHARLOTTE	Behind you.
F	CARRIE	Stanford, you're on my dress.
M	ANTHONY	Get off the dress!
F	MIRANDA	Is that a rip?
M	CARRIE/ANTHONY	Where?!
M	ANTHONY	What?
M	BIG	Can you put Carrie on, please?
M	ANTHONY	Not now... dress emergency.
M	ANTHONY (CONT'D)	Damage? What's the damage?
F	SAMANTHA	There's so much fabric I can't see.
M	ANTHONY	Can't see anything behind this friggin' table. Go, go -- everyone out into the hall. You're a queen -- you should know how to step around a gown.
M	STANFORD	Don't call me a queen.
M	ANTHONY	Go -- Out in the hall, your highness.
M	BIG	Hello?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	It's Carrie... leave me a message.
M	BIG	Why aren't you calling me back? I really need to talk to you. Call me back as soon as you get this.
M	STANFORD	Looks like someone had breakfast at Tiffany.
M	BITSY	Sweetheart, look at the size... it's breakfast, lunch and dinner at Tiffany.
M	BITSY (CONT'D)	Gifts?
M	ANTHONY	We have a problem.
M	STANFORD	I know, but for Carrie's sake I've decided to ignore your attitude.
M	ANTHONY	No, a real problem. They're not here.
M	STANFORD	They're probably stuck in traffic.
M	ANTHONY	Both of them?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	This is Carrie, leave a message.
M	BIG	I'm out front -- waiting. I can't go in without you.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Baby, this whole bride and groom thing has really thrown me. I need to know that it's still us. Just like you said. Me and you. Turn around baby, let me see you.
F	MIRANDA	Traffic was the worst --
F	SAMANTHA	Ready. We're ready.
M	STANFORD	He's not here yet.
F	SAMANTHA	Who's not?
M	ANTHONY	The groom.
F	CARRIE	What's happening?
F	SAMANTHA	Big's not here.
F	CHARLOTTE	But we're twenty-five minutes late.
F	CARRIE	Did anyone call him? Give me a phone. Someone give me a phone.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	I don't know how to work this.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Are you okay?
M	BIG	I've been calling you for an hour. Why haven't you been answering your phone?
F	CARRIE	I don't know where my phone is! What is going on? Where are you?
M	BIG	I was out front --but I just left. I can't do this.
F	CARRIE	Oh my God --
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	He's not coming. Oh my God.
F	SAMANTHA	What do you mean he's not coming?
F	CARRIE	Get me out of here. -- Get me out of here!
F	SAMANTHA	Go, go. You take her. I'll stay here and deal with this --
M	BRADY	Where you going, Mommy?!
M	BIG	What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck am I doing? Turn around and go back.
M	RAOUL	It's a one way street. I have to go around the block.
M	BIG	By the time we go around the block she'll be gone. No one's behind us - - Turn around!
M	RAOUL	I think this is them.
M	BIG	Pull over. Pull over.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Carrie!
M	BIG	I freaked out for a minute -- but -- I'm ready now --
M	BIG (CONT'D)	Carrie!
F	CARRIE	I knew you would do this -- I knew it!
M	BIG	I'm sorry -- I just --
F	CARRIE	You left! I am humiliated!
M	BIG	Carrie, wait --
F	CHARLOTTE	No!
F	CARRIE	I thought I would still be in extreme pain but I'm feeling nothing.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	I'd like a little more nothing.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I had gone from Little Women to Little Drunk Women.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Yes, I'm still jilted.
F	SAMANTHA	What the hell got into him? He was perfectly fine at the dinner.
F	CARRIE	I knew it when he called last night. I could tell.
F	SAMANTHA	Why didn't you say anything?
F	CARRIE	Didn't want to believe it. Didn't even want to say it out loud. And now I have nowhere to love -- I meant live. I have nowhere to live.
F	CHARLOTTE	You'll stay here.
F	CARRIE	Forever.
F	CHARLOTTE	Maybe you should eat something.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Anyone hungry?
F	CARRIE	Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	And my clothes. All my clothes. I can never go over there again. How am I going to get my clothes?
F	SAMANTHA	Oh, honey -- I can hire people to do all that. Anything you need.
F	CARRIE	A hit man? I have nothing to wear but a wedding gown.
F	CHARLOTTE	You have your honeymoon stuff here.
F	CARRIE	There's the silver lining. A honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that's pre-paid on my credit card because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me.
F	SAMANTHA	I can get you out of that. Worse comes to worse -- I'll say there was a death or something.
F	CARRIE	Wasn't there?
F	MIRANDA	I did something really bad -- I think.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	I said something to Big. At the rehearsal dinner.
F	CHARLOTTE	What do you mean?
F	MIRANDA	It was right after Steve showed up. I was upset... Big came up to me -- and I said something like: You're crazy to get married. It just came out.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Do you think it was totally the reason?
F	CHARLOTTE	No, no, no. Big has been weird about marriage for years.
F	MIRANDA	I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
F	CHARLOTTE	No, no. This is a really bad time to even mention it - no, no, no. Find another time. Later.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon -- but I got us in.
F	MIRANDA	What?
F	SAMANTHA	I just booked us three seats on the flight. Mexico here we come.
F	MIRANDA	I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.
M	PAULO	Welcome to Mexico.
F	SAMANTHA	Buenos dias.
M	PAULO	I'm sorry. I am confused. I am waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.
F	SAMANTHA	Honey, you'll be waiting for a long time. We'll talk.
F	SAMANTHA	This... will kill her. Where is she?
F	CHARLOTTE	In the powder room.
F	MIRANDA	Oh My God!
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	No more honeymoon stuff. This is very important. Have I made myself clear?
F	MIRANDA	Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrow
F	SAMANTHA	Well, it's a gorgeous sunset.
F	CARRIE	Close the shutters.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	All of them.
F	MIRANDA	Morning.
F	CARRIE	Did I dream it?
F	CHARLOTTE	Carrie, it's dinner time. You slept the whole day.
F	CARRIE	So?
F	SAMANTHA	Honey, you have to eat a little breakfast.
F	CARRIE	I'm tired.
F	SAMANTHA	Eat something and you can go back to sleep.
F	SAMANTHA	With all this gorgeous fresh food you're just going to eat that pudding crap the entire trip?
F	CHARLOTTE	It's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe. See. Made in Poughkeepsie. I don't want to chance it.
F	MIRANDA	It's a five-star resort.
F	CHARLOTTE	It's Mexico.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Carrie!
F	CARRIE	Is there coffee?
F	MIRANDA	The sun feels nice.
F	SAMANTHA	Jesus, honey. Wax much?
F	MIRANDA	-- What? I didn't know I was going to be in a swimsuit.
F	CHARLOTTE	What are you talking about?
F	MIRANDA	I forgot to get a wax.
F	SAMANTHA	Since when -- 1998?
F	MIRANDA	I've had other things on my mind.
F	SAMANTHA	I could be on death row and not have that situation.
F	MIRANDA	Well, when you're married, Samantha -- you have a different set of priorities.
F	SAMANTHA	Honey don't blame marriage -- This one's married -- and she's not growing a national forest. How do you even cross your legs? Let me make you a spa appointment -- Any thicker and you won't be able to find it.
F	MIRANDA	So what -- It's my fault?! I let the sex go out of our marriage! I deserve what I got. Thanks for understanding.
F	SAMANTHA	Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what --
F	MIRANDA	I'm fine!
F	CARRIE	Let's go down to the hotel for dinner on the beach tonight.
F	CHARLOTTE	Really?
F	CARRIE	Yeah. I've got to do something to pull me out of my Mexicoma.
F	SAMANTHA	Oh, honey... you made a little joke. Good for you.
F	MIRANDA	
F	CARRIE	Too late.
M	MAITRE' D	Buenos notches. My name is Felix, I`ll be your server.
F	SAMANTHA	Felix -- We'll start with quatro margaritas.
F	CHARLOTTE	No, I'm not drinking. Just bottled water.
F	CARRIE	I'll drink hers.
M	FELIX	May I have your room numbers?
F	CARRIE	We're staying in one of the private houses. Number three.
M	MAITRE' D	Very good, Mrs. Preston.
F	CARRIE	That was like taking a bullet.
F	MIRANDA	Charlotte had pudding in her Prada.
F	CARRIE	Will I ever laugh again? I'm serious.
F	MIRANDA	Yes.
F	CARRIE	When?
F	MIRANDA	When something is really, really funny.
F	CARRIE	Thank god for that Mariachi band or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.
F	SAMANTHA	Fabulous -- and keep them coming.
F	CARRIE	After everything I know... After twenty years of everything we've learned -- I threw it all away for the thrill of putting his name on the honeymoon suite. If I met me now -- I wouldn't know me.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, as long as we're going down this road.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	I can't believe my life revolves around a man. On what planet did I allow that to happen?
F	CHARLOTTE	You love him.
F	SAMANTHA	Does that mean saying his name fifty times more a day than I say my own? Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine? Is it all about the other person? Is that love?
F	MIRANDA	No, that's marriage.
F	CARRIE	So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing? Good to know right about now.
F	SAMANTHA	Even this ring. I wanted to buy this for myself. That meant something to me. To be able to do that. Then, he buys it for me.
F	CHARLOTTE	Because he knew how much you loved it.
F	SAMANTHA	Yes. But now, every time I look down at it... I see him. Not me.
F	CHARLOTTE	You could look at it and see a man who loves you and wants you to be happy.
F	SAMANTHA	No, you could look at it and see that. I'm Samantha. We'll take another round.
F	CHARLOTTE	Another?
F	SAMANTHA	Relax -- we're on vacation.
F	CARRIE	Technically -- we're on my honeymoon.
F	MIRANDA	No-- I think we're on their honeymoon.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	It's all so hot -- three days in.
F	CARRIE	He couldn't get out of the car. After everything he'd already put me through -- he couldn't make the effort and get out of the car? I made the effort -- I put a bird on my head.
F	MIRANDA	Was that what that was?
F	CARRIE	Yes.
F	MIRANDA	I thought it was just feathers.
F	CARRIE	No. It was a bird.
F	CHARLOTTE	It was beautiful.
F	CARRIE	He's a bad guy. Always was. Bad guys do bad things.
F	MIRANDA	And good guys do bad things. The good guys screw you and the bad guys screw you.
F	SAMANTHA	And the rest of them don't know how to screw you. Trust me-- I've done the leg work.
F	MIRANDA	And that was all Steve had -- didn't have money -- didn't have a career. He was the good guy bartender with a big dick.
F	SAMANTHA	How big?
F	CHARLOTTE	I don't want to know this.
F	SAMANTHA	Eat your pudding.
F	MIRANDA	Nine. Like -- nine and change.
F	CARRIE	That's nice. Kinda balances off the one ball.
F	SAMANTHA	You can't forgive a man with a dick over nine inches? Well, honey, if you can't -- some other woman will.
M	FELIX	Ladies -- the bar is closing.
F	CHARLOTTE	Thank God.
F	CARRIE	Mrs. Preston will take the check.
F	SAMANTHA	And a bottle of tequila.
F	CHARLOTTE	Don't go all the way in -- there may be sharks!
F	CARRIE	"Mail box full."
F	SAMANTHA	No time like the present.
F	CARRIE	Not ready to face it all yet.
F	CHARLOTTE	I'm going for a run and then to the gym for pilates. Anyone want to --
F	MIRANDA	Good news. Just got an e mail from your buyer's attorney -- they have agreed to sell you back your old apartment at that escalated price. And "are willing to vacate by the time you return -- pending an additional financial offer."
F	CARRIE	Well, apparently you can go home again -- but it'll cost you.
F	SAMANTHA	Now -- lets work on getting your things there.
F	CARRIE	You two could rule the world.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	After her workout Charlotte couldn't help but think about how truly blessed she was. This week had made her feel more grateful than ever for her happy marriage.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And while picturing her loved ones at home in New York, she forgot where she was...
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And opened her mouth.
M	WORKER	Hello Miss.
F	CARRIE	Sweetie -- what's --
F	SAMANTHA	That's locked -- Use the other--
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And just like that, Charlotte Pookeepsed in her pants.
F	MIRANDA	Did you --
F	CHARLOTTE	Shut up, shut up, shut up. Miranda was right -- when something was really, really funny -- I laughed.
M	VOICEMAIL (V.O.)	First message. Received: Saturday, September twentieth; twelve-thirty P.M. Hey babe -- I need to talk to you before you leave for the -- . There was no better time I could think of to hire and assistant.
M	SPOILED LABEL QUEEN	Ummm, no. I don't lift boxes. Yeah, definitely - No.
M	PARTY GIRL	I love your books. You're shit's brilliant.
F	CARRIE	Um, Cathy... You seem drunk.
M	PARTY GIRL	Little bit. Never got to bed last night. But I type like a motherfucker.
M	BUSINESS GUY	I have a degree in finance from Princeton and for the last two years I have been assistant to a V.P. at Merrill Lynch.
F	CARRIE	And why do you think you're right for this job?
F	CARRIE	So, you're from St. Louis?
F	LOUISE	That's right. Louise from St. Louis.
F	CARRIE	Have you ever been a personal assistant?
F	LOUISE	No, but I'm the oldest of six kids, so I can pretty much handle anything you got.
F	CARRIE	Six kids? What was that like?
F	LOUISE	Crowded. I had to move to New York just to get some room. And where'd I wind up? A one bedroom apartment with three roommates.
F	CARRIE	Aside from the space issue... why'd you move to New York?
F	LOUISE	To fall in love.
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	What? That's corny, right?
F	CARRIE	No, it's just -- so -- honest. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that in a long time.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Well... Louise from St. Louis... I have just one more question. How does an unemployed girl with three roommates afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley Louis Vuitton bag?
F	LOUISE	It's rented. "Bag, Borrow or Steal." It's like Netflix for purses.
F	CARRIE	No! How can I not know about this?
F	LOUISE	Girl, stick with me, I'll hook you up.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And she did hook me up.
F	LOUISE	Carrie Bradshaw... This is Louise. Anne From the New York Observer...
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	I'll let her know you called. After only three days -- I began to think of her as Saint Louise from St. Louis.
F	MIRANDA	No, I can't be more patient. Your agency has had three weeks to find me an apartment. No -- I told you... It has to be in Manhattan. Because it does.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	How hard could it be to find something just on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge?
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	On second thought -- Forget it. I could do a better job myself.
F	MIRANDA	According to New York Magazine, this is the new up-and-coming neighborhood.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	See! Wherever he's going is where we need to be.
F	MAGDA	I've been here before -- This was all Ukrainian area.
F	MIRANDA	Coming or going?
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Going. Oh boy. Lets go.
F	MIRANDA	Hi. I'm interested in the apartment.
M	NYU KID	Get in line.
F	MIRANDA	I understand but -- who would I talk to about it?
M	NYU KID	The super.
F	MIRANDA	Lovro... -- and I have no idea. Ku...
F	MAGDA	Kljuic. Lovro Klujcik. I know him.
F	MIRANDA	No way.
F	MAGDA	We were couple -- long time ago.
F	MIRANDA	No way -- You dated?
F	MAGDA	Haven't seen him since his wife died.
F	MIRANDA	He's single?
M	LOVRO	No, no... I told you on phone... the apartment is --
M	LOVRO (CONT'D)	Magda? Is this you?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	As much as Miranda wanted to pat herself on the back for finding her new apartment in just one afternoon... in the end, she knew --
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It was a Lovro connection.
F	SAMANTHA	That was really hot.
M	SMITH	Hmmm. You were kind of distant.
F	SAMANTHA	Distant? You're still in me.
M	SMITH	You want to talk about it?
F	SAMANTHA	When have I ever wanted to talk about it?
M	SMITH	Okay. I'll talk about it. Your best friends get screwed over by their guys -- how can you not get distant?
F	SAMANTHA	It's more than that -- lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to --
M	SMITH	What? Me?
F	SAMANTHA	No -- to -- it -- here. I have no real connection to our life here.
M	SMITH	What life here? Seriously -- all I do is work -- and you run off to New York every chance you get.
F	SAMANTHA	Not every chance I get. Only for the A-list things. And my managing you -- it's all too much. I'm starting to resent it. For the last two years it's been all about you.
M	SMITH	Well, for the first three years it was all about you.
F	SAMANTHA	I know. That was so much more fun.
M	SMITH	Maybe we need to make an effort to reconnect -- spend more time together -- away from the business. Less me, less you -- More us.
F	SAMANTHA	So, I won't be coming to New York for a while. We're going to spend some time reconnecting on the weekends... do the "LA couple thing."
F	CARRIE	Yeah, hi, can you put on Samantha?
F	SAMANTHA	Really. At first I was all: "You can't tell me what I can do" -- but then, I had to admit he had a point.
F	CARRIE	You people and your relationships.
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	Please deposit another eighty-five cents.
F	SAMANTHA	Honey, a pay phone? Where's your cell?
F	CARRIE	At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.
F	SAMANTHA	Want me to hook you up with a new one?
F	CARRIE	No, not yet. No phone -- no calls, no calls-- no questions, no questions-- no explaining no wedding.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Plus, It's an excuse to break out the gloves. When Samantha Jones decides to do something...
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	... She does it all the way. She and Smith did all the upscale L.A. couple things. Sushi... ... Spray tanning.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	... And saving Somalia... Samantha- style.
F	LOUISE	Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.
F	CARRIE	-- Interesting -- so is Carrie Bradshaw.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Come on -- When are we going to get to the really important things like unpacking my closet?
F	LOUISE	One thing at a time. Are you ever going to answer these emails?
F	CARRIE	Yes.
F	LOUISE	When?
F	CARRIE	Now?
F	LOUISE	Okay -- I'll read -- you tell me what to do.(beat) Vitaminsforless. Delete. Right?
F	CARRIE	So right.
F	LOUISE	Who's John@jjpny.com.? Oh, shit -- that's him, right?
F	CARRIE	Delete.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	And -- isn't there some cyberspace place that you can send those so that I never have to see an email from him ever again? Do that please.
F	LOUISE	You sure you want to end all communication with him?
F	CARRIE	"And Cinderella and Prince Charming lived happily ever after." This is a fairy tall sweetheart. Things don't always happen like this in real life -- you should know that now.
F	LILY	Again!
F	CARRIE	And another one bites the dust.
F	LILY	Mommie home!
F	CHARLOTTE	Thanks for watching her while I went to the doctor.
F	CARRIE	Sure. Everything okay?
F	CHARLOTTE	I'm pregnant.
F	CARRIE	How?
F	CHARLOTTE	My doctor said sometimes when women stop trying -- it can happen. She knows other couples that adopt and then get pregnant.
F	CARRIE	Sweetie.
F	CHARLOTTE	Carrie -- I'm pregnant!
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	I guess, in certain houses, fairy tales do come true.
F	CARRIE	I can't believe you're even dressing up.
F	MIRANDA	All the parents at Brady's school dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Witch and -- "sexy kitten". That's it? The only two choices for women. Witch and Sexy kitten.
F	CARRIE	You said a mouthful there, sister.
F	MIRANDA	Maybe I should just wear this and a business suit and go as myself.
F	CARRIE	Speaking of monsters -- I got an email from Big. "I don't know what to say." Ah... then don't send an email.
F	MIRANDA	What were you expecting?
M	CHILD	Boo!
F	CARRIE	Gonna take a little more than that to scare me after what I have been through. And in the subject box: two words: I'm sorry.
F	MIRANDA	Steve is all about "I'm sorry." I'm sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm sorry cards. How about: don't do anything to be: " I'm sorry" for.
F	CARRIE	Maybe he's sorry.
F	MIRANDA	Maybe Big is too.
F	CARRIE	Point taken. I still can't believe this happened to me. I know it happened, but I can't believe it happened. I lay awake at night going over every detail of the last week in my head.
F	MIRANDA	Carrie -- There's a detail I've been meaning to tell you about --
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And then I saw it...the only thing scary enough to scare me after the experience I'd been through.
F	MIRANDA	You look great, you look amazing. So. That's the worst of it. Wait -- what's that say? In the box at the end?
F	MIRANDA	"Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press. Carrie Bradshaw is...
F	CARRIE	Is what? "Carrie Bradshaw is still single and living in Manhattan." I didn't want to buy it - but I figured it was one less Vogue in New York.
F	CHARLOTTE	I saw it. The pictures are gorgeous.
F	CARRIE	Yes -- I'm a beautiful bride. Come in.
F	CHARLOTTE	Look, the people who don't know -- will only see the beautiful pictures. The people who do know will only see what an asshole he is. Mommy said a bad word.
F	CARRIE	Hi, honey.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	For me? And what are you going to be for Halloween?
F	LILY	Cinderella.
F	CHARLOTTE	Or -- we also brought Mulan. Would you like to go trick or treating with us?
F	LILY	Yea!
F	CHARLOTTE	Just in our building -- if you feel up to it.
F	LILY	Yea!
F	CARRIE	Yea!
M	HARRY	No costume?
F	CARRIE	Look closer. I'm the scariest thing in New York. Jilted at Forty-one. Boo.
F	CARRIE	You know you have to give me some of your loot, right?
M	CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY	Trick or treat!
M	WOMAN	Oh, Carrie, I saw Vogue -- I'm so sorry.
M	CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY	Trick or treat!
F	CARRIE	Louise!
F	LOUISE	Oh my Lord. I did not even recognize you.
F	CARRIE	That's the point. My head is the witness protection program.
F	LOUISE	I'm really feeling that look on you.
F	CARRIE	And I am feeling that Balenciaga on you.
F	LOUISE	Mine till Tuesday. Here -- time to re-join the world.
F	CARRIE	Already?
F	LOUISE	Your new number... area code: 347 --
F	CARRIE	Hold, Hold, Hold. 347? No, no. I'm a 917 gal. Always have been.
F	LOUISE	No longer available. Now, you're
F	CARRIE	Great. Now even I don't recognize me.
F	SAMANTHA	Samantha Jones. Carrie Bradshaw --
F	CARRIE	-- Or I used to be.
F	SAMANTHA	Talk to me.
F	CARRIE	I'm a 347 area code. How tacky is that?
F	SAMANTHA	347 is the new New York.
F	CARRIE	I want the old New York with the old 917 and my old will to live.
F	SAMANTHA	Old New York, new New York -- honey -- at least it's New York.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	Another hard thing about being in L.A? My "sex on a stick" next door neighbor. I can't stop looking at him.
F	CARRIE	Looking?
F	SAMANTHA	Just looking. After I saw Steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never ---
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	But you should see this guy. Every night sex with a different partner. He's like -- --Me. Five years ago.
F	CARRIE	Yes. When I was a 212. And in an effort to stay out of her house and out of trouble -- Samantha went shopping. It certainly wasn't the cutest dog in the pen - but their was something about it --
M	RESCUE WOMAN	She needs a good a home. Interested?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And just as Samantha convinced herself that the dog wasn't for her.
M	RESCUE WOMAN	She's been fixed, but she hasn't lost the urge.
F	SAMANTHA	And she needs a little eye work. Anything you can do about these stains?
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	Honey, I don't mince words.
F	LOUISE	Do you want me to get rid of it?
F	CARRIE	No, it's too beautiful. I'll just bury it deep in the back -- like I did my feelings.
F	LOUISE	Do you miss him?
F	CARRIE	Every day. You know, it's weird -- I haven't cried very much at all. Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and I used mine up.
F	LOUISE	Yeah. I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year. And I miss him all the time. Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there were two broken hearts in my-walk in. Louise -- we need a cocktail. Grab your rental.
F	LOUISE	And it threw me so hard `cause, you know, I thought Will -- that's his name... was the love of my life.
F	CARRIE	What happened?
F	LOUISE	He said he loved me and all -- but didn't think I was "the one".
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	And that hurt. But -- you know -- whatever. I'm not going to give up on love.
F	CARRIE	Good.
F	LOUISE	Love is the thing, you know.
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	See that. I'm bringing it to me all day long.
F	CARRIE	Oh, I remember that smile. Who's the guy?
F	LOUISE	Someone I just met. He wants me to meet him for a drink.
F	CARRIE	At 11:30? That's a bootie call.
F	LOUISE	No, it's not like that... he just got off work -- he's a waiter.
F	CARRIE	Louise, I may not get texts and I may not send texts -- but trust me: The sub-text of that text: Bootie.
F	LOUISE	But it's not a bootie call if he meets me.... right?
F	CARRIE	All right, then. You kids enjoy. That's what your twenties are for. Your thirties are to learn the lessons.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	And your forties are to pay for drinks.
M	HARRY	You going for your run?
F	CHARLOTTE	Um... no.
M	HARRY	You didn't go yesterday either.
F	CHARLOTTE	I know.
M	HARRY	Why is that?
F	CHARLOTTE	I don't feel like running!
M	HARRY	Okay. Welcome to the house of hormones.
F	CARRIE	It's all about the desk. If I find the desk, the writing will come. And it better `cause I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator.
F	CHARLOTTE	I think it's so great that you are re-doing your entire apartment.
F	CARRIE	Out with the old -- -- In with the overpriced.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Hey, Harry called me and mentioned you're not running.
F	CHARLOTTE	Why'd he do that?
F	CARRIE	`Cause he loves you... and he's concerned.
F	CHARLOTTE	There is nothing to be concerned about.
F	CARRIE	Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something?
F	CHARLOTTE	No, she said because I'm already a runner -- it's fine.
F	CARRIE	So, why are you not --
F	CHARLOTTE	I'm afraid something bad will happen. It's a miracle that I'm even pregnant.
F	CARRIE	But if the doctor said --
F	CHARLOTTE	It's not rational, Carrie... it's irrational. I know that.
F	CARRIE	Okay.
F	CHARLOTTE	I've got everything I ever wanted. I'm so happy -- I'm terrified. No one gets everything they want. Look at you. Look at Miranda. You're such good people and look what happened to you. Of course, something bad is going to happen to me.
F	CARRIE	Sweetie, you shit your pants this year. Maybe you're done.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	You run every day -- that's what you do. You can't stop being who you are -- just because you're afraid. Right?
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Now let's get down to business. I've got to have my apartment done in time for that baby shower.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And as the last of the autumn leaves fell away -- so did Charlotte's fear.
F	LOUISE	You sure you don't want me to RSVP to some of these holiday parties?
F	CARRIE	Yep. I'm perfectly happy spending time home alone. And speaking of home -- you're going to miss your plane.
F	LOUISE	Merry Christmas. It's just something silly.
F	CARRIE	Oh... Louise from St. Louis.
F	LOUISE	You said you never saw it -- so.
F	CARRIE	Now, I feel bad. If I had known we were going to exchange gifts -- I would have bought you one two weeks ago and hidden it in here.
F	LOUISE	No! That is not what I think it is.
F	CARRIE	Open it.
F	LOUISE	Oh my Lord. Oh my --
F	CARRIE	No more rent girl for you.
F	LOUISE	Look who's home from the big city! It was the best money I'd ever spent.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	New Year's Eve... and a Cup O'Soup.
F	MIRANDA	And what are you gonna say at midnight?
M	BRADY	Happy New Year.
F	MIRANDA	That's right -- but you gotta say it more excited than that -- "Happy New Year!"
M	BRADY	Happy New Year!
F	MIRANDA	You say that and then... you kiss.
M	STEVE	You all ready to go, B-boy?
F	MIRANDA	Did you pack the new Batman Santa brought you?
M	STEVE	Aw man -- Gotta have the new Batman.
F	MIRANDA	It's there near the tree.
M	STEVE	You got plans with the girls?
F	MIRANDA	We're all kinda staying in tonight.
M	STEVE	Would you like to come and eat with us? We can go somewhere over here on your side.
F	MIRANDA	No, thank you.
M	STEVE	Miranda -- I never meant to hurt you.
F	MIRANDA	There he is. Batman.
M	STEVE	Put your hat on. It's snowing out.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Happy New Year.
F	MIRANDA	Happy New Year.
M	BRADY	Kiss.
F	MIRANDA	See you tomorrow.
M	JUDY GARLAND	ZING ZING ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS THE MOMENT I MET HIM -- I FELL
F	CARRIE	Hello?
M	STANFORD	Happy New Year -- We're having a fabulous time. The only thing missing is you. Come.
F	CARRIE	That's sweet but I can't, I'm writing.
M	STANFORD	Oh... Okay. You're not really writing are you?
F	CARRIE	No. You're not really having a fabulous time are you?
M	STANFORD	No. Rescue me. It's very forced festive.
F	CARRIE	Oh yes, that's just what every New Year's Eve party needs: a visit from the lost Bronte sister.
M	STANFORD	Well... Better a Bronte sister than a Hilton sister.
F	CARRIE	Thanks but -- by ten PM I'll be in bed asleep and blissfully unaware of how fabulous this night is supposed to be.
F	CARRIE	Hello.
F	MIRANDA	I thought one of the perks of having a family is you don't have to spend New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food. I'm alone with Chinese food.
F	CARRIE	I was sleeping.
F	MIRANDA	Oh, shit -- I'm sorry.
F	CARRIE	That's okay. Where's Brady?
F	MIRANDA	It's Steve's night.
F	CARRIE	Right.
F	MIRANDA	Go back to sleep -- don't wake up.
F	CARRIE	It's okay. Are you alright?
F	MIRANDA	I'm fine -- I was just getting a little choked-up watching the stupid New Year's Eve stuff on TV alone.
F	CARRIE	Want me to come over?
F	MIRANDA	I'm all the way downtown --
F	CARRIE	I can grab a cab --
F	MIRANDA	On New Year's Eve? No way. I'm fine... really.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	I just wanted to talk a little. Go back to sleep. Good night.
F	CARRIE	You're not alone.
M	TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
F	CARRIE	Easy girl.
F	SAMANTHA	Thanks -- Three months driving in L.A. and I forgot how to use my fucking legs.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Every year the women of New York leave the past behind and look forward to the future... this is known as Fashion Week.
F	CARRIE	This way. I hear the couture calling my name.
F	SAMANTHA	See this -- this is what I miss. Last night Smith and I cuddled in front of the TV with "take out" Mexican.
F	MIRANDA	-- In your four billion dollar beach house.
F	SAMANTHA	Still -- I don't think I'm cut out for the one-on-one relationship thing. You've been doing it for five years.
F	SAMANTHA	No, see -- I've always had girlfriends on the side.
F	MIRANDA	There's Mayor Bloomberg.
F	SAMANTHA	New Yorkers are so damn attractive - - Even the Mayor is hot.
F	MIRANDA	I believe that was his last campaign slogan.
F	SAMANTHA	There we are.
F	CHARLOTTE	We're in the front row?!
F	SAMANTHA	I pulled some strings.
F	CARRIE	Very nice.
F	SAMANTHA	I should go thank them --
F	CHARLOTTE	Decide where we want to go for lunch -- I'll make the call. It's like old times.
F	MIRANDA	So, this is how you all spent your Saturdays while I was with Brady and Steve at the Brooklyn Aquarium.
F	CARRIE	Well... Not every Saturday.
F	MIRANDA	Just so you know -- We always had front row at the mammal show. Steve does the funniest dolphin impression. Actually, it's more -- Steve as a dolphin --
F	CHARLOTTE	You really can't forgive him?
F	MIRANDA	Are you suggesting something?
F	CHARLOTTE	I like Steve. I've always liked Steve -- He's apologized a hundred times -- he's not seeing anyone else. What's it going to take?
F	MIRANDA	And are you also suggesting that she forgive Big?
F	CHARLOTTE	No. I could kill Big. Sometimes when I'm running -- I imagine what I'd say if I ever saw him again. I have the perfect opening sentence. Want to hear it?
F	CARRIE	Ah.... yes.
F	CHARLOTTE	I curse the day you were born.
F	CARRIE	Impressive. Better work up a hand gesture to go with it.
M	ELAINE	Thank god you're here. They have me covering this Mercedes-Benz fashion week and I'm desperate for a Carrie Bradshaw-esque quote.
F	CARRIE	Well, I'll do my best. We'll talk after?
M	ELAINE	Great. And -- ooh -- my back --
M	ELAINE (CONT'D)	-- Can I just say that I'm so sorry about what happened with your wedding.
M	ELAINE (CONT'D)	I don't know how you survived it. I, personally, was so devastated I took myself off JDate -- but you survived and you're here and you look amazing and I just think that's so great. Everyone in my row does -- we can't stop talking about it. Okay -- Meet you in the lobby after.
F	CARRIE	I've gotta go.
F	MIRANDA	Should I --
F	CHARLOTTE	Carrie, wait.
F	CARRIE	This was a mistake -- it's too soon -- I'm not ready. I'll go get a coffee and you guys call me after -- and I'll meet you for lunch.
F	CHARLOTTE	Are you sure? I know how much you were looking forward to this.
F	CARRIE	Yeah, I really was... until I became the poster child for wounded women everywhere.
F	CHARLOTTE	You're not.
F	CARRIE	Is this thing going to effect everything I do for the rest of my life?
F	CHARLOTTE	No -- but if you leave right now -- it will effect the rest of your day.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	It's Fashion Week. We're in the front row.
F	CARRIE	Where everyone can see me.
F	CHARLOTTE	Who cares about them -- You only came for the clothes. I know it's hard but -- It's like you said: You can't stop being who you are.
F	SAMANTHA	We thought we were leaving.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	I didn't know if it was the fashion or the fact that the four of us were together again -- but for the first time in a long time -- I felt like myself.
F	SAMANTHA	Let's get a cab -- I am starv --
M	ACTIVIST #1	Fur is murder!
M	ACTIVIST #2	MUR-DER. MUR-DER.
F	SAMANTHA	God, I miss New York.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And a couple of weeks later -- I met St. Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Over Christmas they realized how much they loved each other. Just in time for Valentine's day.
F	CARRIE	Hello?
F	SAMANTHA	I'm just calling to make sure you aren't hanging from your shower rod.
F	CARRIE	You called an hour too early.
F	SAMANTHA	So, what's the V-day plan?
F	CARRIE	Miranda and I are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie.
F	SAMANTHA	Perfect.
F	CARRIE	And you?
F	SAMANTHA	I am making Smith sushi. Pause for reaction.
F	CARRIE	Wow. Do you make sushi?
F	SAMANTHA	We took a class a while back -- and when he walks in the door at seven- thirty, I am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table - -- covered with homemade sushi.
F	CARRIE	Boy, you do have time on your hands.
F	MIRANDA	Is it me or is Valentine's Day this year on steroids?
F	CARRIE	I think it was like this last year but we played for the other team.
M	WAITRESS	Good evening. Here's our special Valentine night menu. All the selections are romantic in theme and designed to be split for two. Are you having wine?
M	CARRIE/MIRANDA	Yes.
M	WAITRESS	A glass or a bot --
M	CARRIE/MIRANDA	Bottle.
M	WAITRESS	I'll be right back to take you and your girlfriends order.
F	MIRANDA	I could do a lot worse.
F	MIRANDA	Why would you look at the Vogue today of all days?
F	CARRIE	`Cause -- I'm an emotional cutter. I deserve what I got. Running all over New York believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending. "See everyone, love does conquer all. Look at me in my one of a kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life."
M	WAITRESS	Would you like another bot --
M	CARRIE/MIRANDA	Yes.
F	CARRIE	And Miranda... in that article -- I did not say "we" once. It was all: "I" want and "I" think.
F	MIRANDA	It was from your point of view.
F	CARRIE	My point of view... Exactly. The whole wedding was my point of view. I let the wedding get bigger than Big. I am the reason he didn't get out of that car.
F	MIRANDA	You can't put this all on yourself. Okay. I said something I shouldn't have said to Big at the rehearsal dinner. What do you mean?
F	MIRANDA	I was really upset after Steve showed up and I bumped into Big and -- I said that you two were crazy to get married.
M	WAITRESS	Here we go. Your Shiraz.
F	MIRANDA	Stop -- It's fine -- Thanks.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, I was upset-- Steve had--
F	CARRIE	I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months -- and -- for five months you kept a secret like that?
F	MIRANDA	I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out --
F	CARRIE	Once? You tried to tell me once? You should have tried to tell me every single day!
F	MIRANDA	I know, I was looking for the right time.
F	CARRIE	There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage!
F	MIRANDA	It just happened -- I wasn't thinking.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I --
F	CARRIE	And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever!
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	No, I'm lying. For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve. There. How does it feel?
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Excuse me! Babe -- we're way behind on set. I still haven't been released. I'll get there as soon as I can.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	It was the same Valentine night Samantha had planned -- minus the sushi.
M	SMITH	I'm home!
M	SMITH (CONT'D) (CONT'D)	Man, that was a long day -- the crew went into double overtime.
F	SAMANTHA	You are three hours late.
M	SMITH	Bummer. I know. Did you eat?
F	SAMANTHA	Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I hand made for you. The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you.
M	SMITH	Why are you so upset? I called.
F	SAMANTHA	I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you.
M	SMITH	You made some sushi -- it's not a big deal!
F	SAMANTHA	Not a big deal?
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	You see this -- This took me five fucking hours!
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	I am not the type of woman who sits home all day waiting for a man! You love California so much -- enjoy your hand-made California roll! It's me. Pick up. Are you there?
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Three days of "I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers -- and I still wasn't ready. It was the longest we'd even gone without speaking.
F	MIRANDA	Carrie. Hi. I need to talk to you.
F	CARRIE	How long have you been waiting here?
F	MIRANDA	Seventeen dollars long. Please get in. It just turned to eighteen. This is weird not talking.
F	CARRIE	I'm upset.
F	MIRANDA	Carrie, I understand -- but it just happened -- I never meant to hurt you. You have to forgive me.
F	CARRIE	You know --
F	MIRANDA	What?
F	CARRIE	No.
F	MIRANDA	Please. What were you going to say?
F	CARRIE	You badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.
F	MIRANDA	It's not the same thing.
F	CARRIE	It's forgiveness.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	And -- I know you're not the reason my marriage fell apart. I was just - desperate to have someone else to blame.
F	MIRANDA	I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again.
M	THERAPIST	Steve - you're very quiet today.
M	STEVE	Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me. But -- You made it hard for me to trust you.
F	MIRANDA	Me?! The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah -- I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about that? How do I know she won't punish me for the rest of my life?
M	THERAPIST	You don't. And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion. All you can know... is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other won't allow that to happen.
M	THERAPIST (CONT'D)	And that's what we'll discover here.
F	MIRANDA	So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.
F	CARRIE	Can you do that?
F	MIRANDA	I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.
F	CARRIE	Thinking -- or feeling?
F	MIRANDA	What do you mean?
F	CARRIE	Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.
F	MIRANDA	Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel.
F	CARRIE	You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past.
F	MIRANDA	And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.
F	CARRIE	Where is it?
F	MIRANDA	The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places.
F	CARRIE	Very logical. And yet poetic.
F	MIRANDA	Poetic -- if we both show up. Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected. Not a good plan.
F	LOUISE	I have two pieces of good news.
F	CARRIE	And I have two coffees.
F	LOUISE	I just got a heads-up from your realtor. The apartment on Fifth finally sold.
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	You have sixty days before the new owner takes possession and you are out of there.
F	CARRIE	What's the other news?
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Oh my God --
F	LOUISE	I'm moving back to St. Louis -- we are getting married in the fall. Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles... ... Samantha had money, a career and a man who loved her... Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life.
F	SAMANTHA	No! Come back here.
F	SAMANTHA	Where are you, baby? Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick-- --Deck!
F	DANTE	Want to join me?
M	DANTE (CONT'D)	I'm Dante. Stop by -- anytime.
F	SAMANTHA	Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.
F	SAMANTHA	We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros. And Miranda never looked back...
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Well, almost never.
F	MIRANDA	Kiss me.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	And at home -- everything felt and looked different -- and yet still very much me.
F	CARRIE	Sorry. This is a very exclusive party.
F	MIRANDA	We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes plus one...and a half.
M	ANTHONY	A woman just put a glass down on your new desk without a coaster. I told her if she did it again I'd break her arm.
F	CARRIE	Thanks.
F	MIRANDA	Where's Samantha? Her plane landed two hours ago.
F	CARRIE	You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out.
F	SAMANTHA	There's no place like home.
F	CARRIE	Sweetie!
F	MIRANDA	There's a rat in your purse.
F	CARRIE	And that rat better be house trained.
M	CATER WAITER	Can I take your coat?
F	CHARLOTTE	Samantha! You have a -- dog!
F	SAMANTHA	Did you ever think you'd see the day -- me with a pooch.
F	MIRANDA	So, she has a belly. So what?
F	CARRIE	No, a belly on anyone else is a "so what?" A belly on Samantha is a: "So what the hell is going on?"
F	CHARLOTTE	She never mentioned it on the phone?
F	CARRIE	Never. And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
F	CHARLOTTE	Should we even bring it up?
F	MIRANDA	What -- like a fat intervention? "We love you -- have a salad?" No. We should let her bring it up.
F	SAMANTHA	Ladies, we can talk about my gut later-- right now, I'm bored to tears here.
F	SAMANTHA	I eat -- so I won't cheat.
F	MIRANDA	What exactly are you eating?
F	SAMANTHA	Everything except Dante's dick.
F	CARRIE	Language, please -- this is a grown- up apartment now.
F	SAMANTHA	I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.
F	CARRIE	How -- and I say this with love -- How could you not realize it?
F	SAMANTHA	I've been avoiding mirrors.
F	CHARLOTTE	I'm proud of you for not cheating.
F	SAMANTHA	I don't know if there's anything to be proud of. I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
F	CARRIE	Why didn't you say something?
F	SAMANTHA	I guess I didn't want to admit it. And when you're in denial -- you don't dial.
F	CARRIE	Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight. You'd be gorgeous at any size. But are you happy?
F	SAMANTHA	Relationships aren't always about being happy, right? How often do you feel happy in your relationship?
F	CARRIE	I'm pretty sure that's to you.
F	CHARLOTTE	Every day.
F	SAMANTHA	You feel happy ever day?
F	CHARLOTTE	Not all day -- everyday -- but everyday.
F	MIRANDA	When was the last time you felt happy?
F	SAMANTHA	Six months ago. What am I going to do?
F	CARRIE	What does your gut tell you?
F	SAMANTHA	I know but -- Smith stayed with me through chemo. If he could stay with me through that, I should be able to stay in this relationship for him.
F	CARRIE	Sweetie... You just compared your relationship to chemo. There we were...the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid. And Samantha?
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	That pillow cost three hundred dollars.
M	SMITH	Hey -- You're home! I thought you were staying the week.
F	SAMANTHA	We need to talk.
M	SMITH	Awwww... man. I knew this was coming.
F	SAMANTHA	Yeah. This isn't working. I've done my best. I've given it five years and fifteen pounds.
M	SMITH	What -- You don't love me any more?
F	SAMANTHA	Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it -- I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say -- I love you but I love me more. And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on. You'll find a wonderful woman who loves being in a relationship.
M	SMITH	What will you find?
F	SAMANTHA	I don't know. But that's a risk I'm willing to take.
M	SAMANTHA (CONT'D)	No. I'm keeping this. Every time I look down at it I want to think of you.
M	STEWARDESS	We're landing in new York. I'm gonna need to take that now.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	As someone returned to my life...
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	... Someone left.
F	LOUISE	And I put all the unopened mail from your P.O. Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf there. And please -- please do not make a mess of CarrieBradshaw.com -- it's my masterpiece.
F	CARRIE	What am I gonna do without you?
F	LOUISE	You'll find some other girl... but she won't have my style.
F	CARRIE	St. Louise, you brought me back to life.
F	LOUISE	And you gave me Louise Vuitton.
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	Serious. We need to stop cryin'. Your keys.
F	CARRIE	Wait -- don't forget your "love."
F	LOUISE	No, I found my love. I'm leaving that with you.
M	LOUISE (CONT'D)	See you at my wedding.
F	CARRIE	I'll meet you in St. Louis.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	Now, there were no more distractions. And as I moved on...
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	... Samantha moved in.
F	SAMANTHA	Hi, I'm your new neighbor.
M	HOT NEIGHBOR	Diego.
F	SAMANTHA	Samantha.
M	HOSTESS	When are you due?
F	CHARLOTTE	Next week.
M	HOSTESS	You look gorgeous.
F	CHARLOTTE	Oh, thank-you.
M	WAITRESS	Hi, can I --
F	CHARLOTTE	No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay -- Help me -- pull out the table. I can't --
M	BIG	Charlotte. Charlotte wait -- You're pregnant -- don't run.
F	CHARLOTTE	I don't want to see you.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	I'm so mad at you. I was always on your side and then you did that to Carrie -- No, no -- I'm not going to cry -- I'm not going to waste tears on you -- I curse the day you were born! I think my water just broke. Oh my God -- Taxi! My car's right there. Get in my car.
F	CHARLOTTE	I don't want to get in your car -- I hate your car. Taxi!
M	BIG	Charlotte -- we need to get you to the hospital -- Please get in my car. It's right here and ready.
F	CARRIE	Hi. Congratulations... A girl!
M	HARRY	It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.
F	CARRIE	Oh my God. She's gorgeous.
F	CHARLOTTE	Say hello to Rose.
F	CARRIE	What a beautiful name. After Harry's "Bubbie."
M	HARRY	Now, we got a Lily and a Rose.
F	CARRIE	Well, I have to say you two are very cool customers -- just making the "baby's here" call without all the "I'm in labor" drama.
M	HARRY	Oh -- there was plenty of drama.
F	CHARLOTTE	My water broke in front of a restaurant.
F	CARRIE	Very dramatic.
M	HARRY	Wait -- she's not done.
F	CHARLOTTE	It broke while I was talking to Big.
F	CARRIE	What?
M	HARRY	See. Drama.
F	CHARLOTTE	I bumped into him and I got so upset I started crying and then - my water broke.
M	HARRY	He brought her to the hospital. Stayed until the baby was born.
F	CHARLOTTE	I think he was hoping to see you.
F	CARRIE	Well -- today is not about him. It's about beautiful baby Rose. So -- we know she has Charlotte's hair -- what else do we know?
F	CARRIE	She's a doll. Mazel tov!
M	HARRY	He asked me to ask you to call him.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	I know! It's none of my business. But I felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you. I swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall -- his heart stopped.
F	CARRIE	Harry -- it's so much more complicated than you can imagine.
M	HARRY	I know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but I'm just a big pile of love today --and I feel bad for the guy. He said he's been writing you -- but you never responded.
F	CARRIE	He's never written me.
M	HARRY	He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number.
F	CARRIE	No. He's never written me. Ever.
M	HARRY	Then, why would he say that he had?
M	CARRIE (VO)	Two hours, two manila envelopes and countless emails later, I was just about to give up on the Big riddle when --
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again. Hey, Louise -- it's me. What's the password to get into your assistant file? Call me.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Shit.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	Oh my God.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	As soon as I typed in "love" -- there he was.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And because Big still didn't have the words... he retyped a love letter from Beethoven.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And Lord Byron.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And James Joyce.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And Voltaire.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	There they were. "The Love Letters of Great Men - Volume One." Plus one more... Written by John James Preston.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I wanted to call him - but our love... Carrie and Big: volumes one, two, and three... stopped me. Hello. I didn't hear my phone.
F	LOUISE	We are shopping for my wedding gown.
M	ANGELA	That one makes you look weird.
F	LOUISE	Momma -- can you please -- This is a work call.
F	CARRIE	No, it's okay I figured it out.
F	LOUISE	Well, I was going to call you anyway -- today is the final day on the Fifth Avenue apartment. You have till six before they change the locks.
F	CARRIE	I don't need to go over there.
F	LOUISE	And do you NOT want those never- worn shoes?
F	CARRIE	Oh -- I completely forgot about --
F	LOUISE	`Cause if you don't -- send them on to me. I'll squeeze my feet into them.
F	CARRIE	It's already five o'clock.
F	LOUISE	Hello? There are never been worn four hundred dollar shoes!
F	CARRIE	Five twenty-five. Bye.
F	CARRIE	Taxi!
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	The light in our pre-war apartment looked completely different post- war.
M	BIG	I was going to get these to you. I didn't want it to be a total loss.
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	It wasn't logic -- it was love.
F	CARRIE	Why did we ever decide to get married?
M	BIG	I guess we were afraid it meant something if we didn't.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	I'm sorry to have done that to you.
F	CARRIE	I'm sorry to have done that to you... And you know the funny part?
M	BIG	Is there a funny part?
F	CARRIE	We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after.
M	BIG	Yep. The jokes on us.
F	CARRIE	Good closet.
M	BIG	Thanks.
F	CARRIE	Comfortable. Is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet?
M	BIG	I'd like to think I was that smooth.
F	CARRIE	We better get up before the new owner bust in on us.
M	BIG	And the way we decided to get married -- All business... No romance. That's not the way you propose to someone.
M	BIG (CONT'D)	This is. Carrie Bradshaw -- love of my life - - will you marry me?
M	BIG (CONT'D)	See, this is why there's a diamond. You need to do something to close the deal. And in the end... Carrie Bradshaw married John James Preston in a label-less dress.
M	JUDGE	By the power vested in me, by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
M	BIG	Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.
M	BIG	You okay that it was just us?
F	CARRIE	Perfect. You and me -- like I said.
M	BIG	Still. Would have been nice if you had the girls here.
M	BIG	Which is why I called them.
M	MIRANDA/SAMANTHA	Congratulations!
F	CHARLOTTE	Mazel tov!
M	GUARD	Excuse me -- excuse me! You're not allowed to throw rice anymore.
F	SAMANTHA	Honey, get over it -- It's New York!
M	WAITRESS	Who had the ham and eggs? It wasn't a fancy designer reception either. Just food and friends.
F	CARRIE	Maybe some labels are best left in the closet...
M	CARRIE (V.O.)	... Maybe when we put a label on people... bride, groom, husband, wife, fat, thin, married, single... we forget to look past the label and see the person.
F	CHARLOTTE	Hmmm. This is delicious.
F	MIRANDA	Why did we ever stop drinking these?
F	CARRIE	Because everyone else started.
F	SAMANTHA	Well, that is an oldie but goodie.
F	CARRIE	And speaking of an oldie but goodie... Wait -- wait -- a toast.
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	To Samantha... fifty and fabulous!
M	CARRIE (CONT'D)	To us... and the next fifty!
M	ALL	To the next fifty. And there, in the same city where they met as girls, four New York women entered the next phase of their lives... dressed head to toe in love.
M	CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And that's the one label -- that never goes out of style.
M	FADE TO BLACK.
