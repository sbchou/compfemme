M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SAILOR #1	-- Jesus, look at him -- -- what? -- you never saw a dead man before? --
M	SAILOR #3	-- look, look he was shot -- -- don't, don't do that --
M	SAILOR #2	-- he's dead, you think he cares? --
M	SAILOR #1	-- so have some respect -- it's a --
M	GIANCARLO	-- it's here -- hang on -- it's here somewhere -- give me a minute -- get some blankets -- get some blankets on him -- -- here we go -- here it is --
M	THE CAPTAIN	Giancarlo. We pick him up? Okay, we have to pick him up. But that's as far as it goes.
M	GIANCARLO	He needs a doctor.
M	CAPTAIN	Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't care. We've wasted two hours on this shit already. You do what you can, but we're not going back. You understand me?
M	GIANCARLO	Yes, sir.
M	CAPTAIN	Let's get back to work!
M	GIANCARLO	You're awake. Can you hear me? You've been shot. I'm trying to help you. You were in the water. You've been shot. It's okay now.
M	THE MAN	Where am I?
M	GIANCARLO	You're American. I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
M	THE MAN	Where am I?
M	GIANCARLO	You're on a boat. A fishing boat. Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The water. The wounds are clean. I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay. It's clean.
M	THE MAN	How did I get here?
M	GIANCARLO	You we're lost at sea. They pulled you out. Who are you? You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back. You understand me? Who are you?
M	THE MAN	I don't know.
M	THE MAN	What if it doesn't come back?
M	GIANCARLO	I told you. You need to rest.
M	THE MAN	I can read. I can read that sign on the door. I can count. I can talk... What are you doing?
M	THE MAN	What is that?
M	GIANCARLO	It came from your hip. Under the skin. You have a bank in Zurich. You remember Zurich?
M	THE MAN	No.
M	GIANCARLO	Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
M	THE MAN	I don't remember Zurich.
M	GIANCARLO	You drink rum?
M	THE MAN	I don't know.
M	THE MAN	I don't know who I am. Do you know who I am? Do have any idea who I am?
M	THE MAN	Tell me who I am. If you know who I am, please stop fucking around and tell me.
M	GIANCARLO	It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
M	THE MAN	I won't forget this.
M	TICKET AGENT	Una sola via?
M	THE MAN	Si. One way. Una sola via.
M	WOMBOSI	...no, no, no -- the time is not right, my enemies are too strong. I'm telling you to wait for this, you understand? I'm telling you this, and I'm making a warning to all those peoples out there that think that my powers have become so weak that they can play with me as they wish. You will see -- I will tell you when the evidence is clear. Then you will have a story. My old friends will hear about themselves.
M	MARSHALL	That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris the day before yesterday. I'm sure most of you have a passing knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of you on the African desks have worked with him over the years. Some of you very closely...
M	MARSHALL	...He was an irritation before he took power. He was a problem when he was in power. And he's been a disaster for us in exile. Wombosi likes to send us messages through the European media. This is an interview we pulled down from a local German television station in Dresden. We've been getting these little broadsides every couple of months. He knows this -- he knows that -- he's writing a book about the Agency's history in Africa -- he's going to name names. It's basically a shakedown...
M	MARSHALL	This interview -- and I'll make the tape available for anyone who wants it -- he goes on to claim that he has just survived an assassination attempt. He says it's us. He says he's got proof. The overwhelming negative ramifications of this should be obvious. The Director wants to know if there is any possible shred of truth in this accusation.
M	ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)	Can't you read the signs?
M	ZURICH COP #2	On your feet. Let's go. Right now.
M	ZURICH COP #1	The park is closed. There's no sleeping in the park.
M	ZURICH COP #2	Let's see some identification.
M	ZURICH COP #1	Come on. Your papers. Let's go.
M	THE MAN	I've lost them. I've... My papers. They are lost.
M	ZURICH COP #1	Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.
M	ZURICH COP #2	-- come on -- hands up -- up --
M	THE MAN	-- look, I'm just trying to sleep okay? -- -- I just need to sleep --
M	ZURICH COP #2	-- no -- please God no -- please don't -- please no -- my Go
M	CONKLIN	What?
M	ZORN	Abbott wants to talk.
M	CONKLIN	Tell him we're busy.
M	ZORN	I tried.
M	ABBOTT	Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
M	CONKLIN	I don't know what we're talking about.
M	ABBOTT	We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. Was this Treadstone?
M	CONKLIN	You're asking me a direct question?
M	ABBOTT	Yes.
M	CONKLIN	I thought you were never going to do that.
M	ABBOTT	They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that?
M	CONKLIN	You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that.
M	ABBOTT	And what if I couldn't do that?
M	CONKLIN	Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets.
F	RECEPTIONIST	Can I help you?
M	THE MAN	I'm here about a numbered account.
F	RECEPTIONIST	If you'll just enter your account number here I'll direct you to the appropriate officer.
M	BANK GUARD #1	They've been waiting your hand, sir...
M	APFEL	Good morning, sir. I assume you're here about your box.
M	THE MAN	...yes... The box.
M	BOURNE	My name is Jason Bourne. Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason Bourne, nice to meet you. NATIONALITY: SIGNATURE SAMPLE:
M	And a bar code.	Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian. NATIONALITY: U.S.A. PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France There's a signature sample. And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

M	BOURNE	I'm trying to think how long it's been since I was here.
M	DEPOSIT GUARD	I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.
M	MARIE (O.S.)	-- no, this is not my current address. It was my current address two days ago when I started standing in line outside --
F	MARIE	-- and so now I lost my apartment, I have no address, and I have no visa, and you keep telling me how much help you cannot give me!
M	CLERK	Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
F	MARIE	All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
M	CLERK	Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
F	MARIE	You only know that because I told you! Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
M	CLERK	-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
F	MARIE	-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week... ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
M	CLERK	-- Miss Kreutz, please --
F	MARIE	-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
M	CLERK	So now you're asking for a student visa?
M	CONKLIN	-- and they're sure it's him? --
M	ZORN	-- he accessed the account --
M	CONKLIN	-- but it was him --
M	ZORN	-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
M	MAN ON LINE (O.S.)	You're up.
M	WOMAN CLERK	You're a U.S. Citizen?
M	BOURNE	Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...
M	WOMAN CLERK	Well, either you are, or you aren't.
M	BOURNE	Right.
M	WOMAN CLERK	You have your passport?
M	BOURNE	I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated.
M	WOMAN CLERK	Do you have your passport, sir?
M	BOURNE	Look, maybe I should just...
M	WOMAN CLERK	Sir, you waited on line.
M	BOURNE	Yeah, I know...
M	SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)	-- stop! -- stop right there! --
M	SECURITY CHIEF	-- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag -- stop right there! -- hands up! --
M	GUN MARINE	-- you heard him -- let's move it! -- down -- let's go! --

M	SECURITY CHIEF	-- we're evacuating the building --
M	DEPUTY DCM	-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
M	SECURITY CHIEF	-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
M	DEPUTY DCM	-- you gotta give me more to go on --
M	SECURITY CHIEF	-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
M	VOICE (O.S.)	-- no! -- the other way! -- take the backstairs! -- the backstairs! -- he's on the other side -- there's a bomb! --

F	MARIE	Motherfucking sonsofbitches!
F	MARIE	What are you looking at?
M	BOURNE	I need a ride.
F	MARIE	What?
M	BOURNE	I need a ride out of here.
F	MARIE	Oh, Jesus...
M	BOURNE	Please. I don't want to scare you.
F	MARIE	It's a little late for that.
M	BOURNE	I've got a situation here and --
F	MARIE	Get the fuck away from my car.
M	BOURNE	I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
F	MARIE	Great. You know what? I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
M	BOURNE	You don't want the police any more than I do.
F	MARIE	Jesus...
M	BOURNE	Get me out of here. Please.
M	CONKLIN	go -- keep going -- go...wait -- stop -- you went past it --
M	CONKLIN	It's him. My God, it's really him...
M	COM TECH #2	-- we got a cross-ref ready to go here, sir, we're running hotel, airline, train, and medical variables, anything else you'd like?
M	CONKLIN	No... Go ahead. Run it. Let's get a map, let's get a grid map on Zurich.
M	ZORN	Sir...
M	CONKLIN	What?
M	ZORN	Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag. Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
M	CONKLIN	What the fuck is he doing?
M	ZORN	Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
M	CONKLIN	It doesn't matter now. We've just got to be the first ones there. Get everybody up. I want them all activated.
M	ZORN	All of them?
M	CONKLIN	You heard me.
M	COM TECH #2	Sir, the cross-ref is coming up cold...
F	MARIE	So what's in Paris?
M	BOURNE	I want to go home.
F	MARIE	For twenty thousand dollars.
M	BOURNE	I said ten thousand.
F	MARIE	You have blood on your pants.
M	BOURNE	Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
F	MARIE	No. No, that was too easy --
M	BOURNE	Wait up -- -- just wait up --
F	MARIE	-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
M	BOURNE	Look, I want a ride to Paris. That's all I want. I swear.
F	MARIE	You swear? That's great. I feel so much better now.
M	BOURNE	I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
F	MARIE	You could buy a car for twenty grand. You could buy this car.
M	BOURNE	I don't want to go alone. I want you to drive me to Paris. Like we're a couple. Like we're a couple and we're travelling together. That's all we're doing.
F	MARIE	And I don't get hurt. I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
M	BOURNE	I won't hurt you.
F	MARIE	What if I say no?
M	BOURNE	Then I'll find another ride. NATIONALITY: SIGNATURE SAMPLE: A BAR CODE: Two Italian. Two Spanish. A Portuguese.
F	MARIE	Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me. I was supposed to have this car back three days ago. It's not my car.
M	BOURNE	I know that.
F	MARIE	Shit -- Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out? Okay? Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
M	BOURNE	I'm sorry. Really. What do you want me to do?
F	MARIE	I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. Something. You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, I don't know... What kind of music do you like?
M	BOURNE	I don't know.
F	MARIE	What does that mean?
M	BOURNE	Listen to what you want.
F	MARIE	Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
M	BOURNE	I don't know. I don't know who I am.
F	MARIE	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
M	BOURNE	No. No, I mean, I really don't know who I am. I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago. I'm serious.
F	MARIE	What? Like amnesia?
M	BOURNE	Look, go ahead... put the radio on...
F	MARIE	Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
M	BOURNE	That's what I'm saying.
F	MARIE	Give me a fucking break.
M	MORGUE BOSS	Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...
M	WOMBOSI	Get the fuck out of my way --
M	WOMBOSI	It's not him.
M	WOMBOSI	So who's crazy now?
F	MARIE	And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
M	BOURNE	No.
F	MARIE	When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
M	BOURNE	Nothing. It's just not there.
F	MARIE	Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
M	BOURNE	I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
F	MARIE	-- you could put it together --
M	BOURNE	-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened.
F	MARIE	What are you talking about?
M	BOURNE	I don't know.
F	MARIE	Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
M	BOURNE	I was shot twice in the back.
F	MARIE	Okay, so you're a victim.
M	BOURNE	There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
F	MARIE	Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns.
M	BOURNE	I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it. I knew how to do it.
F	MARIE	People do amazing things when they're scared.
M	BOURNE	Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
F	MARIE	You're paranoid. You were shot. It's natural.
M	BOURNE	I can tell you the license plate numbers of all three cars out front. I can tell you that the waitress is left-handed and the guy at the counter weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself. I know that the best, first place to look for a gun is the cab of that grey truck outside. I know that at this altitude I can run flat out for half a mile before I lose my edge. I knew that you were my first, best option out of Zurich? How do I know all that? How can I know all that and not know who I am? How is that possible?
F	MARIE	God, you're not kidding, are you?
M	CONKLIN	And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
M	RESEARCH TECH #1	That's the only angle.
M	CONKLIN	What do they have on the streets? The area. They must have something.
M	RESEARCH TECH #1	Hang on...
M	CONKLIN	What?
M	ZORN	Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
M	CONKLIN	That'll solve all our problems.
M	RESEARCH TECH #1	Sir...
M	CONKLIN	What's that? It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
M	CONKLIN	Enhance it.
M	CONKLIN (O.S.)	Who the hell is that?
F	MARIE	I needed a break.
M	BOURNE	Where are we?
F	MARIE	We're about an hour away.
M	BOURNE	I can't believe I slept.
F	MARIE	You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
M	BOURNE	I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke.
F	MARIE	You ever think maybe you have a family?
M	BOURNE	I thought about it. I don't know.
F	MARIE	I guess it's like Christmas every day for you, huh?
M	ABBOTT	Who is she?
M	ZORN	Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- six. Born outside Munich. Father was a welder. He died in '91. We don't have the mother. There might be a step-sister, we're trying to track that down. It's tough. She's a wanderer. She pops up on the grid here and there but... I mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in Europe was '94. No taxes. No steady employer. She's got three arrests. Two shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one in Germany. And she actually did three months in an Italian detention center for credit card fraud.
M	ABBOTT	No political affiliations?
M	CONKLIN	She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.
M	ABBOTT	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
M	CONKLIN	We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
M	ABBOTT	Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
M	CONKLIN	No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.
M	ABBOTT	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
M	CONKLIN	We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here? I'd rethink that.
M	ABBOTT	I want a second opinion.
M	CONKLIN	This is an operations desk.
M	ABBOTT	I'm not asking.
M	BOURNE	Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...
F	MARIE	That's it? Is that it?
M	BOURNE	Four-fifty. That's the address...
F	MARIE	Looks familiar?
M	BOURNE	No. No. Go around. Keep going...
F	MARIE	Where?
M	BOURNE	Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
F	MARIE	So this is it, right?
M	BOURNE	I guess.
F	MARIE	I should go.
M	BOURNE	I don't remember any of this.
F	MARIE	Jason...
M	BOURNE	Sorry. The money, right?
F	MARIE	Okay, so...
M	BOURNE	Thanks for the ride.
F	MARIE	Anytime.
M	BOURNE	Look, I don't know what's up there.
F	MARIE	You got me pretty fucking curious.
M	BOURNE	Look, you could come up. Or you could wait if you want. I could go check it out. You could wait.
F	MARIE	Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
M	BOURNE	How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.
F	MARIE	I guess you're not home. Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...
F	CONCIERGE	Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was wondering -- I haven't seen you --
M	BOURNE	Here I am.
M	BOURNE	I seem to have lost my key.
F	CONCIERGE	I've been ringing your bell. It's good you were away. We had some trouble with the hot water. It's been repaired.
M	BOURNE	Great. We could use a shower. It was a long drive.
F	MARIE	It's big.
F	MARIE	This is like a real apartment. This is really yours?
M	BOURNE	I guess so.
M	BOURNE	This is my frying pan. This is my spoon. I'm Jason Bourne and this is my kitchen.
F	MARIE	This is your office? God, you live like a monk...
M	BOURNE	All this stuff -- it's all about boats. I think I'm in the shipping business.
F	MARIE	See. It's starting to come back, yeah? You mind if I take a bath?
M	BOURNE	Go ahead.
M	PHONE MACHINE	"You have no messages." Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...
M	BOURNE	...yes -- oui -- uh...
M	OPERATOR/PHONE	Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris. How can I direct your call?
M	BOURNE	Paris?
M	OPERATOR/PHONE	Yes, sir... How can I help you?
M	BOURNE	Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
M	OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, please... I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
M	BOURNE	D'accord... Merci. Un moment -- un moment --
M	OPERATOR/PHONE	-- sir? --
M	BOURNE	-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
M	BOURNE	Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
M	OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, sir.
M	MANAGER/PHONE	Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...
M	BOURNE	Yes, I'm here...
M	MANAGER/PHONE	You call about Monsieur Kane? John Michael Kane?
M	BOURNE	Yes. Is he there?
M	MANAGER/PHONE	You are a friend of his?
M	BOURNE	Yes.
M	MANAGER/PHONE	I have some very bad news for you, sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
M	MANAGER/PHONE	There was an accident. On the motorway. Apparently, he was killed instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
M	BOURNE	...I understand...
M	MANAGER/PHONE	...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
M	BOURNE	Who? Who came?
M	MANAGER/PHONE	His brother. You know his brother?
M	BOURNE	Right. Yes. Of course.
M	MANAGER/PHONE	It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man.
M	BOURNE	Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
M	MANAGER/PHONE	I think not... No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
F	MARIE	She wasn't kidding about the water. It's freezing.
M	BOURNE	Hang on. I'll check the kitchen... Maybe it takes a while to get all the way upstairs. Yeah, it's cold in here, too... Let's give it another minute.
F	MARIE	-- omigod! -- -- what're you? -- no -- no --
M	BOURNE	-- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not like that --
F	MARIE	-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
M	BOURNE	-- quiet -- quiet --
F	MARIE	...what are you doing?...
F	MARIE	omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? -- what're you doing? -- -- what is he? -- what've you? -- omigod -- what is this? --
F	MARIE	-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
M	BOURNE	Open it -- -- do it -- what's he got in there?
M	BOURNE	Who are you? -- who are you?
M	BOURNE	-- who are you? -- tell me who you are -- who sent you? -- -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --
M	BOURNE	WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
F	MARIE	...omigod, no...
M	BOURNE	What? -- what? -- -- what is it?
F	MARIE	...this is my picture... he's got my picture -- -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this... this... this is yesterday --
M	BOURNE	-- just --
F	MARIE	-- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture?
M	BOURNE	Marie, just -- -- just stay there! -- just --
F	MARIE	-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! -- -- where did you get my picture? --
M	BOURNE	-- let me do this, okay? --
F	MARIE	-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture -- -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
M	THE CONCIERGE	Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's going on? Is everything all right in there?
M	THE CONCIERGE	--I'm calling the police, Mr. Bourne -- you give me no choice -- I'm calling them right away! --
M	BOURNE	-- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- where are your shoes? -- Marie --
F	MARIE	He's dead isn't he?
M	BOURNE	Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
F	MARIE	He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
M	BOURNE	-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
F	MARIE	He came to kill us.
M	BOURNE	-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
F	MARIE	You knew he was coming.
M	BOURNE	No.
F	MARIE	I trusted you.
M	BOURNE	You're wrong. I didn't know.
F	MARIE	I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
M	BOURNE	I didn't know this would happen.
F	MARIE	He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us!
M	BOURNE	And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
F	MARIE	Oh, Jesus...
M	BOURNE	You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- But I can't stay here. I can't.
F	MARIE	But the police --
M	BOURNE	-- there's no time --
F	MARIE	-- we'll explain it --
M	BOURNE	-- how? --
F	MARIE	-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
M	BOURNE	-- forget it --
F	MARIE	-- we'll tell them what happened --
M	BOURNE	I don't know what happened! I don't know who he is! I don't know what he wants! I don't even know who I am! The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
M	BOURNE	Come with me. I can get us out of here. I know it. Then we can think. Then we can work it out. We'll explain it then. Once we're safe. I can protect you.
M	WOMBOSI	-- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this far -- out a body in the grave -- another body! -- no! -- this isn't over -- these people are not finished -- nothing will make them finish until they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi -- until I'm the one in the box! --
M	WOMBOSI	-- what are you doing? -- -- sleeping? -- -- he's sleeping! -- this man is sleeping at his post! -- -- I've had men killed for this! -- -- you think these people? -- these people who come for me -- you think they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- they spend all the day -- all the night -- all time thinking about how to put Wombosi in that box! --
M	WOMBOSI	-- there is no box for Wombosi! -- they don't have a box that can hold me! -- I know these people -- I know they never sleep! -- I know they never stop! -- they never stop until the knife is at their throat! -- -- what is the window? -- this window is open! -- who leaves this open! -- -- this is a war, you fool! -- you think these people are like you? -- you think this is stupid people? -- careless people? -- these people see an open window, they reach in with a big hand and grab your heart until you die! --
M	WOMBOSI	-- and it won't just be me! -- they don't just want Wombosi now! -- they want my babies -- they want my children! -- and I say no! -- -- you leave that window open again, you better pray they kill me -- distance and now -- everything changes here now! -- everyone is a soldier here now! -- this is a fortress now! Are we clear with this?
M	DEAUVAGE	Yes, sir. All clear.
M	WOMBOSI	This man is out there. Kane is out there. And they pretend he's dead. That means he's coming back.
M	BOURNE/TAPE	"Okay. Merci." "Un moment -- un moment --"
M	OPERATOR/TAPE	"-- sir? --" "-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --"
M	BOURNE/TAPE	"Kane. John Michael Kane."
M	OPERATOR/TAPE	"One moment, sir."
M	MRS. DOYLE	He's not lying. He's very highly stressed, but he's not lying. He's confused. He's aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos. This conversation, the video from the consulate -- the body language, vocal pattern -- it's my sense he's really lost here. I think he snapped.
M	CONKLIN	Is that a medical term?
M	MRS. DOYLE	You want clinical terminology? It's called, "conversation hysteria." I don't know exactly how you train these people. I'm not sure I want to know. I'll take a guess there's some extremely rigorous behavior modification going on here.
M	ABBOTT	Let's assume that's true.
M	MRS. DOYLE	You can only wind people so tight. Even machines break down.
M	CONKLIN	This unit has an unblemished record of success.
M	MRS. DOYLE	Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.
M	CONKLIN	That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. I have work to do.
M	ABBOTT	What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned?
M	CONKLIN	Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
M	BOURNE	No. You know who you are. You know what that's worth? That's everything. I can't live like this. I can't do anything until I know who I am. Believe me, you don't want what I have. overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this
F	MARIE	You stayed there five times in the past six months. But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days. Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
M	BOURNE	Who paid the bill?
F	MARIE	It's a company... MPG Capital.
F	MARIE	This can't be it.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE (OVER)	Destin Navigational, can I help you?
M	BOURNE'S VOICE (OVER)	Hey, how are you. I'm trying to reach Richard? Is he there.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	I'm afraid there's no Richard here.
M	BOURNE	Well, where are you? Where am I calling?
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	This is an answering service, sir. The company's located in Southampton, but --
M	BOURNE	-- this is a tire dealership, right?
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	No sir, this is a navigational chart registry. I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
M	NEW VOICE (OVER)	Marseille-Tropez Marina, how can I help you?
M	BOURNE	Hey, so this is the Marina, right?
M	NEW VOICE	Yes, sir. Can I help you?
M	BOURNE	This is the one in Marseille, right?
M	NEW VOICE	
M	OPERATOR RECORDING (OVER)	The number you have dialed has been disconnected. If you think you've reached this message in error--
M	RECORDED VOICE (OVER)	"You've reached the office of Simon Rawlins at Alliance Security Maritime Division. Paris office hours are from nine a.m. to six p.m. If this is an emergency, please call our twenty-four hour help line at..."
M	CONKLIN	-- let's check that Interpol window again --
M	RESEARCH TECH #1	-- I'm on it --
M	CONKLIN	-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
M	RESEARCH TECH #2	Sir. I've got a code here from NSA -- they're not gonna give us Keyhole satellite clearance unless we have sign-off from upstairs.
M	ABBOTT	No. We can't risk it.
M	CONKLIN	Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
M	ABBOTT	This doesn't go upstairs.
M	RAWLINS	Mr. Kane... Come right in... please... have a seat.
M	BOURNE	Thanks.
M	RAWLINS	Well... I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
M	BOURNE	Really.
M	RAWLINS	We thought you were gone for good.
M	BOURNE	Did you?
M	RAWLINS	Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.
M	RAWLINS	Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel?
M	BOURNE	Yes.
M	RAWLINS	We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
M	BOURNE	Okay.
M	RAWLINS	Was it the break-in?
M	BOURNE	Excuse me?
M	RAWLINS	We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
M	BOURNE	I hadn't heard.
M	RAWLINS	Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
M	BOURNE	That'd be great.
F	MARIE	I found it. It took six calls. I found Kane. I found the body.
M	BOURNE	Let's go -- We got to get away from this phone.
M	ATTENDANT #1	What was the name again?
M	BOURNE	Kane. John Michael Kane.
M	ATTENDANT #2	It's number 121.
M	BOURNE	I want to see the body.
M	ATTENDANT #1	Our boss could come back. We're not supposed to.
F	MARIE	What?
M	MORGUE BOSS (O.S.)	What the hell's going on here?
M	ATTENDANT #1	This guy, he came to see the American, but the body, it's missing.
M	MORGUE BOSS	They came last night. His brother.
M	ATTENDANT #2	It's not in the book.
M	MORGUE BOSS	Who are these people? Who are you? What's going on here?
M	BOURNE	Where did this body go?
M	MORGUE BOSS	I said, someone came last night -- Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
M	BOURNE	Shit, we didn't sign in.
M	MORGUE BOSS	So get the hell out of here.
M	BOURNE	Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In fact, I insist on it. Where's the book? I gotta sign in --
M	BOURNE	Is this it? -- -- this is it, right? --
M	MORGUE BOSS	-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
M	BOURNE	-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page -- -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
M	MORGUE BOSS	-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
M	BOURNE	-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
M	MORGUE BOSS	-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
M	BOURNE	-- here we go -- I found it --
M	MORGUE BOSS	-- what are you? -- what are you doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped the book! -- you stupid fucki--
F	MARIE	What are you doing? -- -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...
F	MARIE	-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
M	BOURNE	Nykwana Wombosi.
F	MARIE	What is that?
M	BOURNE	It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht. He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package. He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
F	MARIE	What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? up, but he's walking Jason, please... who is he?
M	BOURNE	I don't know.
F	MARIE	So what are we doing?
M	BOURNE	Go back to the hotel.
M	ZORN	They found him. They found Bourne.
M	ABBOTT	Where?
M	ZORN	You better come in.
M	DEAUVAGE	Jesus fuck, what is this?
M	ABBOTT	Omigod.
M	CONKLIN	-- how long? --
M	COMM TECH #1	-- minutes -- he's close --
M	ABBOTT	-- he went inside! --
M	CONKLIN	-- if we can get a clean shot --
M	ABBOTT	-- inside the house? --
M	CONKLIN	-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
M	ABBOTT	Forget it.
M	CONKLIN	What do you want to do?
M	ABBOTT	We don't know what we're into!
M	CONKLIN	We're in the shitter, man! Pick your poison. Maybe he's in there to finish the job. Maybe he's working for Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV together. Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
M	BOURNE	Is he here?
M	CONKLIN	You don't have the stones for this. You people come down here and wink and whisper and we send these guys out and get it done. And you're clear. And the guys upstairs get what they want. And the whole bunch of you are so stuffed on deniability it's coming out of your ears. Well, you know what? You're here now. What do you want to do?
M	WOMBOSI	Come in. Please...
M	WOMBOSI	Did you bring investment advice for me tonight? It was tax shelters, wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.
M	BOURNE	MPG Capital.
M	WOMBOSI	I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. How does it feel to be dead?
M	BOURNE	It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
M	WOMBOSI	-- no -- no, let them in! -- let them in. Come in -- on y va -- come in... I think everyone wants to see the dead man.
M	WOMBOSI	What do you do? You get an appointment with me? You make sure it's on the boat? You come visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit investment package. You drink my water -- eat my bread -- play with my children -- and what? -- two nights later you come back and you put this death -- -- you put this in my engine room!
M	WOMBOSI	So this is a different kind of meeting. Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? One dead man to another.
M	WOMBOSI	You see this? I told you my shot was better!
M	DEAUVAGE	He went in the water -- how did he live?
M	WOMBOSI	No, no no... This is a strong killer. This is a crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah... To make a killer that looks like you? This young? This face? It's bloody fucking amazing.
M	BOURNE	Who do you think sent me?
M	WOMBOSI	I know who sent you. I don't know why. I learned many, many things from the CIA. Many things. I learned the way they think. Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
M	WOMBOSI	You didn't set the bomb. Why?
M	WOMBOSI	Was this a game or a fuck up?
M	BOURNE	I don't know.
M	WOMBOSI	Get the kids out!
M	WOMBOSI	And the door.
M	CONKLIN	-- code him again -- punch it in --
M	COM TECH #1	-- he's not responding --
M	CONKLIN	-- the paging unit must be damaged --
M	COM TECH #2	-- we just ran a remote diagnostic, sir, it's not the unit --
M	ABBOTT	What are you doing?
M	CONKLIN	I'm going to Paris.
M	ABBOTT	No you're not. You're not going anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
M	CONKLIN	You're not doing shit. You're so scared you can't even think.
M	ABBOTT	You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over. Call it off.
M	CONKLIN	I can't call it off. He's not responding. Get out of my way.
F	MARIE	It doesn't matter who you were before. It's who you want to be. That's all that matters. We have this money. We have what we have. I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but... I say we leave here. We leave this place. We go until we can't go anymore.
M	BOURNE	You could do that?
F	MARIE	Yes. That's who I want to be.
M	CLERK	xxxxxx...
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx.
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	Stop where you are.
F	MARIE	What?
M	BOURNE	Where's the dog?
M	CLERK	My husband's out looking for him.
M	BOURNE	He run away often?
M	CLERK	That old beast? Miss his breakfast? Not a chance. It's always something, right?
M	BOURNE	Get in the basement.
M	CLERK	What?
M	BOURNE	Get everyone down in the basement.
M	CLERK	What the hell're you talking about?
M	BOURNE	You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain.
M	CLERK	Wait a minute --
M	BOURNE	I'm sorry.
F	MARIE	Jason...
F	MARIE	Who is it? Who's out there?
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	I won't let that happen.
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	Go!
F	MARIE	Did we lose them?
F	MARIE	Who is it?
M	BOURNE	We have to keep moving.
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	What are you doing?
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	Give me the gun --
M	BOURNE	Wait 'till he's close.
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
F	MARIE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	xxxxxx
M	BOURNE	Who else is coming?
M	BOURNE	I won't ask again.
M	PROFESSOR	I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
M	BOURNE	What do you mean?
M	PROFESSOR	Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone... both of us... I was warned but...
M	BOURNE	Treadstone?
M	PROFESSOR	...which one are you?...
M	BOURNE	Paris. I live in Paris...
M	PROFESSOR	...headaches... you have that... I get such bad headaches...
M	BOURNE	Yes.
M	PROFESSOR	...it's a problem...
M	BOURNE	Treadstone.
M	PROFESSOR	...or in a car... when it's dark... something with the headlights... ...pills, right? Treadstone had those pills...
M	BOURNE	What is Treadstone?
M	PROFESSOR	...what did you do?... you must've really fucked up...
M	BOURNE	I think so.
M	PROFESSOR	...someone said caffeine -- for a headache... doesn't seem...
M	BOURNE	What do they want me to do?
M	PROFESSOR	...they won't let you go...
M	BOURNE	Why?
M	PROFESSOR	Look at this... ...least you have a woman....
F	MARIE	Jason...
F	MARIE	We've got to go.
M	BOURNE	Take this.
M	BOURNE	Take it.
F	MARIE	And that's it?
M	BOURNE	If you're lucky. Take it. There's enough in there to make a life. Any life. Just get out now. Get low. Stay low. Take it.
F	MARIE	What was I thinking, right?
M	BOURNE	I can't protect you anymore.
F	MARIE	What about you?
M	BOURNE	I'm gonna find the end of this. I can't protect you. What did you do to me?
M	CONKLIN	What did I do? What've you done? Do you have any idea? Any conception? What you've destroyed? Do you have any idea how much time and work -- how many people have their lives wrapped up in this?
M	BOURNE	Are you Treadstone?
M	CONKLIN	Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell're you talking about?
M	BOURNE	What did you do to me?
M	CONKLIN	What did I do? I spent thirty million dollars on you. I spent three years finding you -- four years training you -- What did I do? What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
M	BOURNE	I don't know.
M	CONKLIN	They're right about you, aren't they? You're fried. You really don't know what's going on, do you?
M	BOURNE	I know you've been trying to kill me.
M	CONKLIN	Of course. We had to try. We didn't know what was wrong. We didn't know you were in trouble.
M	BOURNE	So now you know.
M	CONKLIN	So it's time to go home.
M	BOURNE	That's all I get?
M	CONKLIN	We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.
M	BOURNE	I don't think so.
M	CONKLIN	We have to go home, Jason.
M	BOURNE	Jason Bourne is dead.
M	CONKLIN	There never was a Jason Bourne. You have to come with me. It's the only way. We can give it back to you...
M	BOURNE	Keep it.
M	CONKLIN	Jason... They can't let you go...
M	BOURNE	That'll be their second worst mistake.
M	ABBOTT (O.S.)	The Treadstone project has actually already been terminated. It was designed primarily as a sort of advanced game program...
M	ABBOTT	...We'd hoped it might build into a good training platform, but quite honestly, for a strictly theoretical exercise, we thought it was far too expensive. The cost-benefit ratio was just too high. It's been all but decommissioned at this point.
M	MARSHALL	All right, what's next?
M	ABBOTT	Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar is a joint, DOD, communications program that we really feel has good traction to it.
F	MARIE	Can I help you?
M	BOURNE	This your store?
F	MARIE	Yes.
M	BOURNE	Think I could rent a scooter?
F	MARIE	You have ID?
M	BOURNE	Not really.
F	MARIE	It's not a problem.
