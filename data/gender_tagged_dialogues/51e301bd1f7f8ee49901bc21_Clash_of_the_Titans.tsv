M	QUEEN DANAE	My King! Has the strategy been set so quickly?
M	REVERSE ANGLE	The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,

It is The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give My own subjects condemn me! They dare judge me? And what emboldens this treachery?...
M	STEWARD	You are mistaken, my King. None would risk your anger --
M	KING ACRISIUS	It is Zeus who warps my kinadom!... Zeus the ungodly, Zeus the defiler... This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about fearlessly.
M	STEWARD	Please, speak not these things -- Acrisius spins on him, out of control --
M	KING ACRISIUS	He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes my precious Queen! This is a low, conniving God... But I have bested him on this day and humbled the great Prime. Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on Olympos? Who does the Fearless One fear?
M	STEWARD	I beg you, Your Highness -- Acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the Steward's
M	KING ACRISIUS	Tell me what the Priests say!
M	STEWARD	Tiamat... Tiamat, Queen of the Deep. Those who dare, whisper she covets Zeus' throne and schemes to achieve it, the ambitious Goddess of the Dark Oceans...
M	KING ACRISIUS	Yes, Tiamat! And today I have honored her. The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.
M	KING ACRISIUS	I've taken Zeus' whore and the bastard she grows in her belly and thrown them to Tiamat in her rough sea! I honor Zeus' rival with all that was dear to me -- -- and commit double murder in her honor... About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again --
M	KING ACRISIUS	so that Zeus will know I despise and disdain him and spit on his foul name! The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight, And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS! The Steward SEES what we now cannot.

M	OLD MAN	Thoth the Quick... Messenger of the Gods. Bound for Olympos. The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a violent wave in the long grass and suddenly -- -- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist -- Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,
M	THOTH	My lord.
M	ZEUS	We have debated, we have voted, and it is decided. We offer the Humans peace. Thoth, you will take them the terms of a treaty -- A treaty! Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are -- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless
M	TIAMAT	We don't negotiate with them! We dictate to them. Their place is to beg. They have forgotten their role and have denied us the sustenance of their prayers.
F	APHRODITE	Our mercy will give them reason to be grateful. They will bow down and whisper our names with more passion than before.
M	TIAMAT	They will bow down when we snap their backs! Mercy? We are Gods! Some of us remember that and are not afraid -- Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
M	ZEUS	Silence! Or learn what it is to be afraid! The debate is over, the votes cast... Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
M	ZEUS	We guarantee an armistice, we shield the bridegroom and the Joppan royal family. And we do not interfere in their actions. We leave them undisturbed unless-invoked by name to enter their affairs.
M	SET	And if they refuse our terms?
M	ZEUS	They have suffered terrible losses. They will not pass up a chance for peace.
M	SET	take.
M	TIAMAT	Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown weaker than I knew. Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks up the two black shards representing their votes. He hands one to Tiamat.
M	SET	So have they all. They no longer see clearly. They're beginning to think like Men. But you and I shall not. Set agrees, his eyes searching her face.
M	TIAMAT	We will manage these thick-witted Humans to our own ends. Yes, we will be bound by great Zeus' rules... until their fragile membranes tear. We dare not interfere with these insects...
M	TIAMAT (CONT'D)	but we may be invited to intervene. Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool --

M	AMOUN	The emissary approaches. Take your time in your responses, debate nothing... I've received ambassadors before.
M	AMOUN	None like this.
M	KEPHEUS	I'm not cowed. If these arrogant Gods are so powerful, why are they the ones seeking a truce? I only recommend you take care with the tone of the conversation. A truce would benefit all...
M	KEPHEUS	In my palace, I decide how the discourse proceeds, not some messenger sent on errands by Zeus.
M	THOTH (O.S.)	You are correct, Your Highness, I do the bidding of Zeus... To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
M	THOTH	... as do all Gods... and all men. Thoth removes his hood, revealing his crystal skull.
M	THOTH	King Kepheus, as humble messenger of Zeus, I've come to talk of peace. Thoth the Quick, I am Amoun, the King's Magi Strategos. We welcome you with humility, honored by your visit from the realm of the Gods. The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by her composure.
M	KEPHEUS	I am a reasonable man. Everyone wishes for the conflict to cease.
M	THOTH	Zeus above all. He has so long desired the tragedy end, he made a plan that began twenty-five years ago.
F	CASSIOPEIA	Twenty-five years! How is that possible? Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her
M	THOTH	Beauteous Queen, let Thoth limn for you the forethought and wisdom of Zeus, God of Gods.
M	KEPHEUS	A treaty marriage?
M	THOTH	You have a daughter of age. Andromeda!
M	KEPHEUS	Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal father to give his daughter to a God.
M	THOTH	No. Such a union would be unclean. Years ago Zeus created a scion of mixed blood. Half-man, half-God. Bred for just this union. That is how important Zeus considers this truce.
F	CASSIOPEIA	Is my only daughter to marry a demigod, not of this earth?
M	THOTH	A prince, of both Olympian and Human royalty. A chosen one. Zeus has given his son to the cause of peace.
M	KEPHEUS	I have heard of no such demigod.
M	AMOUN	Majesty, if I may -- the young man does exist. He lives in a small fishing village on the isle of Seriphos. Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.
M	KEPHEUS	You knew about this and said nothing? Just which king do you serve?
M	AMOUN	My Queen, I serve only the great order of things. I was the boy's tutor years ago.
M	KEPHEUS	How haughty this boy must be, who knows he is half-God.
M	AMOUN	He knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man. He has never left his village. He can be overconfident, but it is from inexperience, not arrogance. Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply
F	CASSIOPEIA	What assurance do we have that our daughter will be safe? You have my word, as Ambassador of the Gods.
M	KEPHEUS	With our daughter's future at stake, we do not bestow trust easily. If any harm should come to her -- Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and The Princessa shall not be harmed.
M	AMOUN	Your Majesty... Of course... of course your word is unquestioned here. Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the
M	KEPHEUS	Where is the lucky young suitor? As the net passes we see -- ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in PERSEUS, 25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw, Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net, Then, gruffly --
M	SPYROS	Your grieving does Anteros no good. It comforts only you.
M	PERSEUS	It's my fault he's gone.
M	SPYROS	He was careless with the net. Perseus gives him a hard look.
M	PERSEUS	So it's his fault. Not mine, not fate, not the Gods? The Gods delude themselves about their power and watch in envy while we act. We make our own history.
M	PERSEUS	Now my history is I let my friend die in my arms. I made it back, why couldn't he?
M	SPYROS	What you do, no other man can do. Have you not noticed?
M	PERSEUS	To what purpose? I failed him. Purpose! Looking for purpose is what ensnares men in the superstition of the Gods, as surely as your friend was caught in that net. And all the searching leads down to the same place. The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
M	PERSEUS	You always say that my abilities are greater than other men's. But they were not enough to save him.
M	SPYROS	You are still a man, confined by man's limits. You are just as likely to fail as succeed.
M	PERSEUS	How is that greater than other men?
M	SPYROS	Ordinary men fail most of the time. The trawler rounds a point on the island. Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer
M	LOOK --	A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias. She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He
M	TEKLA	Mother wants you to come in for supper. Perseus, why are you so sad? This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up
M	TEKLA	I still don't understand.
M	SPYROS	Your mother can explain. She believes everything has an explanation, even if we have to make it up. It's one of the reasons I love you, Marmara.
M	TEKLA	Tell me! Why is there war between Man and the Gods? Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.
M	MARMARA	At the beginning of time, when Man was young, he prayed to the Gods. His belief in the Gods gave his life meaning. It was a good thing.
M	SPYROS	If you consider superstition, fear and darkness good things... But Man grew, as children do, and he turned away from the Gods. Be began to put his faith in other things. Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes.
M	TEKLA	What things?
M	SPYROS	Learning, science... love. self-determination! Those things that give Man dignity and independence.
M	MARMARA	But what of the Gods, who had protected and guided us so long? survive. They hunger for
M	SPYROS	-- as lions hunger for blood.
M	MARMARA	Spyros! Your father's mind is closed on these matters.
M	SPYROS	The Gods were desperate to claim our awe again.
M	TEKLA	Desperate... the Gods?
M	SPYROS	Yes, even the Gods. If they could not earn our faith with love, they would demand it with fear. Whatever was necessary to ensure L their continued existence. Marmara and the wide-eyed Tekla sit down.
M	MARMARA	And that is how war broke out between Man and Gods. Now eat your dinner, which the Gods -- and your father -- have provided.
M	PERSEUS	You... I saw you watching our boat at the cliff.
M	WILTING GIRL	It was not the boat I was watching.
M	PERSEUS	Can I be of service?
M	WILTING GIRL	Yes, of service. I need you to come with me on a journey. Perseus gives her a look.
M	PERSEUS	Right now? It wouldn't take much persuading to get me to leave this village, but tonight is impossible. My family can't wake and find me gone. Where do you want me to go?
M	WILTING GIRL	It's not what I want. I am in the service of others. Perseus can't get over her beauty, the dulcet sound of her voice. Even so --
M	PERSEUS	Come back in the morning and we can talk about it.
M	WILTING GIRL	I'm sorry.
M	PERSEUS	For what? Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
M	PERSEUS' WOOZY POV	The Wilting Girl standing placidly in the doorway watching him.
M	BACK TO SCENE	He blacks out.
M	CLOSER	We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping healing as we look at them. Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting
M	PERSEUS	How long have I been out?
M	WILTING GIRL	This time? Only a few hours. The time before, almost a day. How was your rest?
M	PERSEUS	I had a dream. I fell into a dark pit. I thought I would never stop falling. But a beam of light formed a soft net, caught me and tossed me back. TheWilting Girl watches him.
M	PERSEUS	When I came back up to the world, a beautiful woman appeared and spoke to me. But as she spoke she would sometimes disappear into the whiteness with a strange sound.
M	PERSEUS' POV	The Wilting Girl listens to his story.
M	PERSEUS	When I could hear her, she spoke nonsense. She said that my father was a God and my mother a -- At that moment the blinding-white sail swings between
M	PERSEUS' FACE	as he realizes she is his vision.
M	WILTING GIRL	You are special, Perseus. Your birth was ordained for this very purpose.
M	PERSEUS	I am an ordinary man.
M	WILTING GIRL	Do you ever lie awake during a storm and listen to the thunder? And it sounds as though it matches the beating of your heart? He doesn't have to answer; it's written on his face.
M	WILTING GIRL	How long can you hold your breath? Longer than the others? Are there times when you know you should feel pain, but you don't?
M	PERSEUS	None of that means anything.
M	WILTING GIRL	Look at your arms, Perseus. Perseus watches the bites on his arm heal visibly.
M	PERSEUS	A good trick. You must be the demigod, not me. I'm a Chthonian.
M	PERSEUS	A Chthonian?
M	WILTING GIRL	An Earth Goddess. The Gods have a caste system just as men do. The Olympians are our nobility -- few but cosmic. The Chthonians are the peasants. Our abode is this earth, and we exist as long as men worship us.
M	PERSEUS	And when none worship you? Sadness flickers through her extraordinary eyes. We fade away. This touches Perseus deeply. His tone changes.
M	PERSEUS	And demigods, where do they stand in your hierarchy?
M	WILTING GIRL	Nowhere. Sorry.
M	PERSEUS	If demigods rank so low, why do you need me?
M	WILTING GIRL	For a marriage.
M	PERSEUS	What!
M	WILTING GIRL	Zeus, God of Gods, has proposed a treaty to end the war. At the center is the marriage of a mortal with a demigod.
M	PERSEUS	Who, me?
M	WILTING GIRL	Zeus himself has chosen you. A demigod may be less than a God, but he's more than a Man. One foot in Humanity, the other in Divinity. Your marriage will be a symbol of accord between our races.
M	PERSEUS	Forget it.
M	WILTING GIRL	Such a union could save millions of souls. Perseus is struck by that. He looks off across the sea.
M	PERSEUS	And just who exactly am I supposed to marry? The BOY is AGENOR, a kitchen helper -- ripped and sexy. Andromeda holds him at bay --
F	ANDROMEDA	Do you think you can manhandle a Princess this way? As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant? Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers
F	ANDROMEDA	very mistaken... a woman of my station... never be attracted... They go at it again. She's PESHET, handmaid to Princessa Andromeda. She has a
M	PESHET	Princess... Princess! The Princess is not here. Find another... Princess.
M	PESHET	The Queen approaches! I don't care!
M	PESHET	Andromeda! You'll care enough if you're caught! Remember last time... From inside we HEAR complaining, more kissing and
M	CASSIOPEIA (O.S.)	Peshet! Startled, Peshet spins to see the Queen approach.
F	CASSIOPEIA	Where is the Princess? He ignores her, starts again. Andromeda does something below the frame that jolts him off. The girl can take care of herself.
M	PESHET	Is she not in her chambers, ma'am?
F	CASSIOPEIA	She is not. You are expected to know her -- A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia. Tell the Princess -- should you find her -- her father and I want to see her at once. She stalks away. Urgently, through the door --
M	PESHET	Princess, it's the King as well!
F	ANDROMEDA	To please you, I would submit to such a marriage... except I would rather die; Please let me know you're serious about this perverse plan so I can make arrangements to kill myself. She stomps out. Their gaze follows until she's gone.
M	KEPHEUS	It will take more than half-a-God to handle her.
F	CASSIOPEIA	She'll be a great ruler one day. blush were she not so pale.
M	WILTING GIRL	You're looking in the wrong direction.
M	PERSEUS	I don't think so.
M	WILTING GIRL	Perhaps you should give some thought to your immediate future.
M	PERSEUS	That's what I'm doing.
M	WILTING GIRL	Maybe you should take another look... She indicates the view behind him. Perseus turns, jaw
M	HIS POV	A breathtaking view of Joppa -- a city in two parts. Above, twisting stone stairs climb the cliffs to the The Wilting Girl leads Perseus through the city. He's never seen anything like it. He rubbernecks, awestruck scales over a mold.
M	WILTING GIRL	All the goods, armies, and culture of Man's dominion flow through this port. He who reigns in Joppa, rules the world. Amidst the exotic chaos, Perseus is struck by the homeless refugees on the street and the ruins of once-
M	PERSEUS	The war has badly scarred this place.
M	WILTING GIRL	It is the war you have the power to end. He throws her an angry look, grim.
M	PERSEUS	Don't joke about such things. I'd be useless before such a huge responsibility.
M	WILTING GIRL	Perhaps you would be... ... as you are now. They pass an evangelist (FANTASOS) haranguing a crowd. -- one true God is not Zeus but she called the Deep -- Tiamat! 'Before the first dawn, the eyes of the Deep watched the earth.' Bow down to the Goddess of Chaos or know despair, for Tiamat will rule the heavens and the earth. Perseus is mystified by this talk. He turns to Vidalia Perseus and Vidalia round a corner and see the regal preparing for a big event.
M	PERSEUS	What are they celebrating?
M	WILTING GIRL	You. Kepheus speaking sternly to Perseus, before him.
M	KEPHEUS	. before I am a king or a peacemaker, I am a father. Do you know what that means?
M	PERSEUS	I'm not sure, Your Highness. I did not know my father. Yes, well... it means I had no desire for my little girl's carefree springtime to be cut What is she? I'm sure she's preparing herself to make the best possible impression. Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple. -- and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict... of which she knows nothing at all.
M	PERSEUS	She's not the only one, sir. I don't know much about the events for which I've been drafted.
M	KEPHEUS	I take no comfort in that, young man. In fact, I find little to take comfort in here. You are a stranger from a distant place, and I am asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you. If you are not kind and patient with her, if any harm of any kind should come her way, I will have your head on a stake. Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts
M	KEPHEUS	Is this amusing to you?
M	PERSEUS	Not even a little, my lord. It's just that I myself was waylaid -- snatched also, as you say, from my happy springtime... Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him.
M	PERSEUS	I've been told I'm to play a part in events which serve a higher purpose... of which I'm not at all convinced.
M	KEPHEUS	Does a truce in the war between Men and Gods not strike you as a higher purpose?
M	PERSEUS	With all respect, I have never seen a God. On my island, they're no more than a story. You will learn there is more to this universe than is found on your island. This is supposed to be the son of a God, yet he doubts their existence! They exist, young man. But if you doubt their power, I join you -- Cassiopeia! We have agreed such talk has no place in this palace. Have we?
M	PERSEUS	I can only proceed based on what I have experienced, not on a faith I do not possess.
M	KEPHEUS	Where does a young person get such ideas?
M	PERSEUS	Perhaps from my adopted father, sir. I admire him greatly, and he believes in little he cannot hold in his hand.
M	KEPHEUS	Is he a scholar?
M	PERSEUS	No, Your Highness, a fisherman. I know this mentor who so influences young Perseus. Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts in amazement.
M	PERSEUS	Master Amoun! He hurries over to the older man, who embraces him warmly.
M	AMOUN	Porpoise... You've grown tall and strong since my departure. Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at
M	PERSEUS	What are you doing here?
M	AMOUN	I am honored to serve the King as an advisor. His Magi Strategos.
M	PERSEUS	From my village tutor to Magi Strategos... What a path! The King's patience is exhausted. To Cassiopeia
M	KEPHEUS	Where is Andromeda? At the least, the two should meet before tomorrow's ceremony... Tomorrow? Is the wedding so soon?
F	CASSIOPEIA	The wedding comes later. Tomorrow we will have the public announcement.
M	AMOUN	And a celebration of the treaty. A Page enters and whispers in Kepheus' ear. Kepheus is
M	KEPHEUS	It seems our Andromeda has wandered away. Cassiopeia reacts, upset.
M	AMOUN	Perhaps the thought of her new life has made her frantic to enjoy the vestiges of her old one.
M	KEPHEUS	Perseus, if you're to take the wild girl for a wife, this is a good time to start your training. Go into the city and retrieve her.
M	PERSEUS	How will I know her?
F	CASSIOPEIA	She is unmistakable.
M	PERSEUS	I'm a stranger here. Any hints?
M	AMOUN	Follow the lights and the sound of profane music. Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones, On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her, thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
M	WILTING GIRL	Zeus? Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an Why do we have to play these games, my lovely girl? You know you cannot leave. The vines retract, freeing her. She rubs where they gripped her.
M	WILTING GIRL	My part is finished.
M	ZEUS (V.0.)	It has just begun. Have you forgotten your place in this?
M	WILTING GIRL	As I've lost my believers, the future has become dimmer to me.
M	ZEUS (V.O.)	I still believe in you. Close your eyes and see your tomorrow. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single
M	WILTING GIRL	It's too painful. I can't involve myself.
M	ZEUS (V.O.)	You you already involved. Such is fate. We cannot hide from the .trials of our future... no matter how dark the alleyway. She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness. Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl, Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her
M	PERSEUS (O.S.)	Very beautiful. Andromeda spins, petulant.
F	ANDROMEDA	Will you please give me some The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.
F	ANDROMEDA	What did you say?
M	PERSEUS	I said, 'Very beautiful.'
F	ANDROMEDA	Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family?
M	PERSEUS	I meant the sunset. She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.
F	ANDROMEDA	Do you always start a seduction with an insult? Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
M	PERSEUS	I know nothing of seduction. I'm a simple fisherman. My home is across that water.
F	ANDROMEDA	What brings you here?
M	PERSEUS	To Joppa? I was kidnapped.
F	ANDROMEDA	I mean here, tonight. He looks over at her a long moment.
M	PERSEUS	I've come to see my future wife. Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
F	ANDROMEDA	It's not personal. You're not a bad-looking boy. I'm too young. I don't want to be married.
M	PERSEUS	Me either.
F	ANDROMEDA	Then why are you doing it?
M	PERSEUS	No one asked me. And now that I've met you, I don't know if I can go through with it. It's not personal. Seeing you makes it real. I think a man should make his own decisions. I won't be the pawn of a King or a God. She looks at him with new interest.
F	ANDROMEDA	Since we agree, it's settled. No marriage.
M	PERSEUS	I don't think it's going to be that simple. Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.
F	ANDROMEDA	That doesn't mean we can't be friends. Get to know each other. I want to show you something. She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.
M	PERSEUS	I'm already lost.
F	ANDROMEDA	I'll take care of you. They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed.
F	ANDROMEDA	This is my special place. No one can see or hear or even find us now.
M	PERSEUS	I don't suppose I could escape without your aid.
F	ANDROMEDA	Do you want to? When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and down, holding her at bay.
F	ANDROMEDA	Do you not find me attractive?
M	PERSEUS	One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
F	ANDROMEDA	Of course, you haven't been much in the world.
M	PERSEUS	True. Maybe a lot of girls look like you.
F	ANDROMEDA	Don't you want to make love to your almost-wife? Maybe we'll find we're not compatible.
M	PERSEUS	What if we find we're very compat-- She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
F	ANDROMEDA	Is it true you're a demigod?
M	PERSEUS	It seems what everyone wants to believe. Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.
F	ANDROMEDA	I don't see it. But let's find out for sure... She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
F	ANDROMEDA	I think I'm becoming a believer... They start to make love. Tiamat, I know this place, but I know not why.
M	TIAMAT (V.0.)	In this chamber Zeus defiled the Queen Danae and begat the anointed demigod, who would facilitate this foul truce.
M	SET (V.0.)	Ah, the former palace of the cursed Acrisius.
M	TIAMAT (V.0.)	The King who stood against Zeus and was crushed for it, though he was not the offender. But this is not his former home...
M	TIAMAT (V.0.)	still he dwells in rancid hate, having killed his generals and sucked their bones. We cannot break the rules of Zeus and interfere with the humans. But this poor creature can do our work and visit the would-be groom. What form of monster do you visit upon Perseus? There is an awful SOUND from the darkness of an archway.
M	TIAMAT (V.0.)	What form, dear Set? Why this... In the half-light appears the huge, deformed changeling:
M	TIAMAT (V.O.)	My Servant, your lonely solitude now ends... It's time to leave.
F	ANDROMEDA	You're late.
M	PERSEUS	I didn't know how to get this outfit on.
F	ANDROMEDA	I want to thank you for seeing me home. I was so flushed with wine I can't recall much of the evening. Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd.
M	PERSEUS	Me either. watches from the back of the hall. When they make eye
M	BACK TO SCENE	Perseus is surprised by his feelings. Andromeda has seen At what point do you plan to tell them we're not getting married?
M	PERSEUS	Tell who?
F	ANDROMEDA	Them...
M	FROM BEHIND THEM	We see the ecstatic crowd of thousands, all celebrating
M	ROYAL HERALD (0.5.)	The Queen will speak! The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of
F	CASSIOPEIA	I won't be long-winded. You all know I am a modest person, no matter my rank. Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her watching from his throne. This is not a celebration of a betrothal... not the celebration of the happiness of two parents, or of our good people. Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal Entourage.
F	CASSIOPEIA	This union represents new hope for a lasting peace! That is the only cause for celebration. The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause.

You dare put this frivolous, scrawny slut... above the infinite Goddess of the Deep! Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED.

M	TIAMAT	People of Joppa, hear me. For the sacrilege of this arrogant creature, I will loose Leviathan upon you. The people react in terror. Cassiopeia starts to faint,
M	TIAMAT	I'm not finished. Hold your gaze. For thirty days, Joppa shall suffer the scorn of Leviathan. And on the final day, you will be wiped from the earth. Unless... Instant silence.

Kepheus and Royal Aides rush to like, but it is big. We hear a deafening ROAR, which A lone FISHERMAN unloads nets from his boat. Suddenly, The fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon CLIMBS higher
M	KEPHEUS	Leviathan awakes...
M	AMOUN (O.S.)	. Leviathan -- First dweller of the deep. Hewn by Tiamat from the dark blood of the earth...
M	HER POV	A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus
M	AMOUN	. All monsters of the sea are but shadows of Leviathan the Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and nigh indestructible. The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he
M	KEPHEUS	My Queen lies near death. Am I now to choose between the survival of our state... and the life of Andromeda, my only child? Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group, expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an observer.
M	MINISTER OF DEFENSE	I beg you, do not even consider such a sacrifice -- Do you tell me only what you think I wish to hear!
M	KEPHEUS (CONT'D)	The citizens of Joppa are fighting for their lives. Would you have me gamble the city to save one girl? Again, Amoun looks to Perseus.
M	MINISTER OF DEFENSE	You need make no such choice, Your Highness. Andromeda must.be saved, and the city too.
M	REPHEUS	Impossible. No... We need only the will to do it.
M	KEPHEUS	You spoke the words -- the monster is indestructible! How can that be? Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward Perseus, with
M	AMOUN	Perseus! You had something you wanted to say to the King? All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self-
M	PERSEUS	What? No, Master Amoun. I'm listening.
M	AMOUN	You're 'listening'? We're talking about the precious life of your betrothed. Perseus meets his gaze, confused.
M	PERSEUS	I'm a newcomer here. I would not presume to tell these men --
M	AMOUN	Exactly! A newcomer with a fresh perspective. Share your thoughts with the King, your future father- in-law. The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence. Perseus, uncertainly --
M	PERSEUS	I know that I am young and have not seen much of the world, but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible. The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.
M	SPYROS (O.S.)	I am far from young and have seen much of the world... and I agree with my son. Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive
M	PERSEUS	Father, how did you find me?
M	KEPHEUS	I thought this boy's father was a God. How does a stranger walk unmolested into the Throne Room of the King?
M	AMOUN	I sent for him, Lord. This good man raised Perseus from infancy. He will help him now.
M	KEPHEUS	Help him with what?
M	SPYROS	With whatever is needed... Perseus approaches the King. Surprising himself --
M	PERSEUS	He will help me destroy Leviathan. Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay, sure."
M	UP ON THE BALCONY	Andromeda reacts, falling in love with Perseus.
M	KEPHEUS	But how? Perseus has no idea.
M	AMOUN	Majesty, we can seek the counsel of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia. They know the hidden ways of the Gods. If Leviathan can be slain, they'll know how to do it.
M	PERSEUS	We have thirty days to find its weakness. Twenty-nine.
M	PERSEUS	We'll leave tonight.
M	KEPHEUS	With what army? I dare not weaken our forces when the city is about to be besieged.
M	PERSEUS	We'll go alone. Yes. Give us a map. Amoun laughs. When some of the others join in, the King
M	AMOUN	My King, with your permission... The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to Perseus.
M	AMOUN	I'll give you a map and much more. I'll go with you and bring a small band of comrades to help you on your mission. We can leave at first light. Diokles, the map. The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a
M	PERSEUS' POV	Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible only to him. She silently mouths these words -- "Thank... you."
M	AT THE MAP	which has been hung for all to see, Amoun uses a pointer.
M	AMOUN	We head north on the Via Dahlia. If we can make it to the Disputed Territories... MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun's pointer on the
M	AMOUN (O.S.)	. we'll join the Cleon desert legion, the most formidable unit in all the army... With their escort, we can safely reach our destination in Skolothia, which lies to the east... First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	Our guides will be Mongke and Tamburlane, father and son monster hunters from the Kingdom of the Iron Horde. Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	Our escort will be a detachment of the Praetorian Guard, led by Commander Draco -- the staunchest security force in Joppa. Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the
M	PERSEUS (V.0.)	Why do we bring the Earth Goddess into this danger?
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	I thank the stars we have her. Besides, she takes her orders from an authority much greater than I. Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many
M	PERSEUS	Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence you came into my life as tutor, so long ago, and now, once again you instruct me. No matter what you believe, Porpoise, some things are fated. I've been looking forward to this journey for a long, long time. He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back beside Perseus.
M	SPYROS	Who would have thought we'd be on a journey like this? Two simple fishermen.
M	PERSEUS	I'm afraid I've dragged you into real danger, Father, when I have little idea of what I'm doing.
M	SPYROS	Living at the mercy of the sea so long has convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers unavoidable. It's all in your attitude.
M	PERSEUS	What's our attitude about destroying Leviathan?
M	SPYROS	The Kraken is just another big fish. Perseus smiles, but is not as sanguine.
M	TIAMAT	The demigod and his retinue are joined. They march for the counsel of the Norn Sisters, to seek the frailty of my Leviathan. The Sisters...
M	TIAMAT	Yes. I beseech you, track the expedition.
M	SET	To plainly thwart them would betray our intentions and draw the wrath of Zeus and the others.
M	TIAMAT	That, we cannot have. I merely suggest that the road to Skolothia is hazardous.
M	SET	I take your meaning. And your loyal brute, he is fixed upon the hunt?
M	TIAMAT	Fear not, he is about and he will do his share of damage. Set leaves. Tiamat resumes stirring the storm clouds. Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed, distressed.
M	PESHET	You must sleep. Princessat You must take care of yourself. A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,
F	ANDROMEDA	My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster.
M	PESHET	I'm sure that is not so.
F	ANDROMEDA	I saw it. I heard the words. My loving father, his beloved child. Only Perseus stayed his decision. And do you know the worst part, Peshet? He was right. Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.
F	ANDROMEDA	The city is besieged, the people suffer.
M	ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)	Because of me, because he did not offer me up. Is that right?
M	PESHET	Go to sleep, my lady.
F	ANDROMEDA	Sleep? Sleep will come soon enough for me, faithful one. In one month... at the latest. The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER.
M	PERSEUS	Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess. It will not stop. Tiamat knows no mercy.
M	PERSEUS	By what name may mortals call you?
M	WILTING GIRL	I have no name.
M	PERSEUS	Who do your worshippers pray to?
M	WILTING GIRL	I can't remember.
M	PERSEUS	Perhaps that is why they are falling in number? The Wilting Girl flinches, and Perseus feels guilty about
M	PERSEUS	I have to call you something... Since we're naming you on this road, what about 'Via Dahlia'? She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's
M	PERSEUS	That's a pretty name. Wait, better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's that... 'Vidalia'? That's more than pretty, beautiful really, just as you are. She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road
M	PERSEUS	You don't like it? What's that? I missed it --
M	WILTING GIRL	I do not object. She picks up the pace, moving her horse a little ahead. Mongke and Tamburlane emerge from the woods with armfuls
M	DRACO	More. The Mongols stare -- either not comprehending or ready to
M	DRACO	It must last all night. Get some more. I'll find some more.
M	ABAS	Commander, I'll get some, too. Perseus and Abas head off into the woods in different Perseus sees Vidalia on the far side, her back turned. through the vines.
M	HIS POV	The leaves offer tantalizing cover to her naked body.
M	PERSEUS	Now is when an honorable man would turn around and walk away... . but they say I am not really a man. Vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back, looking sadly into the sky. Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts Perseus' HEART POUNDS in his ears as he watches. KRA- heartbeat -- BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! Vidalia instantly knows he is nearby. She looks around Perseus retreats. After a few yards, he stops, face
M	PERSEUS	Vidalia... A DARK FIGURE is standing behind him, larger than a man,
M	SET	Hear me, my pet. Let my instructions be seared to your primal mind as natural law.
M	L	The monster's eyes shoot open; its pupils shrink to pinpoints.
M	SET	You are starving. Your gut says you'll soon perish. No earthly meat will still that hunger. What you need, what you ache for, is the flesh of... a demigod! Draco, Boreas, Icos and Perseus -- thrilled -- hide in a
M	DRACO	Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.
M	ICOS	Perseus. How long do you think you could stay on one of those? Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.
M	BOREAS	Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man can ride a Pegasus.
M	ICOS	Did not Bellerophon tame the Great White Pegasus?
M	BOREAS	You're right. But he was a demigod... Then this will be a good way to find out just what I am.
M	DRACO	Stop it, rogues. One of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief. What if Perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up?
M	BOREAS	Don't worry, Commander, the boy won't even get on its back. With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him
M	DRACO	Don't do this. If we go back to camp right now, we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight. A true leader will not be distracted.
M	PERSEUS	I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun is. I'm too young to start avoiding trouble. Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It face-first into the dirt. Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
M	BOREAS	I'll collect him right now, Commander. Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.

M	DRACO	I told you to run, boy. You'll make things worse.

M	VIDALIA	A delusion is planted in its mind. It thinks it's starving and it wants to feed on -- The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces
M	VIDALIA	I can't reverse the powerful curse. But if the monster's hungry, I can feed it. Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of Now! The belly! Slash the belly! Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
M	TO THE GROUND.	The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
M	VIDALIA	I should cast a spell upon you and leave you forever a stone upon this stream.
M	PERSEUS	I didn't beckon the Humbaba.
M	VIDALIA	You did, with your childish recklessness, and Boreas has paid the price! Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.
M	VIDALIA	Your safety is entrusted to me by the mightiest power on Olympos. But without a thought, you risk life and limb, your own and your fellows'.
M	PERSEUS	The monster killed my friend. I could not contain my rage. But you, Goddess, are aloof from the emotions of Men. Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.
M	VIDALIA	Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who dares question your mad rush to annihilation. The hopes of multitudes reside with you. You're late in learning you cannot act upon every impulse. She whirls and walks away. Perseus is left with the leads Peshet in from the rain. She is frightened; Agenor
M	PESHET	Where have you brought me?
M	AGENOR	It's okay... Peshet tries to leave, but Agenor stops her.
M	AGENOR	Just listen to this good man. He needs your help. Fantasos comes forward. He fixes her with a hypnotic
M	FANTASOS	Do you know who I am, child?
M	PESHET	You are the Priest of the Streets.
M	FANTASOS	That's right. You know that the good common people of Joppa trust that I will look after their welfare.
M	PESHET	Some do...
M	FANTASOS	Do you love the people of Joppa, Peshet? Do you want them to be destroyed by this awful curse? No, of course not. You want what's best for the people.
M	PESHET	I have always served the royal family.
M	FANTASOS	Yes, you have, good Peshet. And now you may be in a better position than anyone to help the Princessa save the city.
M	PERSEUS	Master Amoun... You knew about me, didn't you? When you came to our village?
M	AMOUN	Your birth was written in the stars. I sought you out and took it as my cause to teach you.
M	PERSEUS	You chose a poor student. I have learned little and my mistakes cost dearly.
M	AMOUN	Understanding that is the first step toward knowledge.
M	PERSEUS R	It won't do Boreas any good.
M	AMOUN	You can honor Boreas by the way you act from this moment forward.
M	PERSEUS	I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not even much of a human.
M	AMOUN	It is not your choice. You are what you are. Amor fati, Perseus. 'Love thy fate.'
M	PERSEUS	I do not believe my fate is to be half a God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight.
M	AMOUN	Concentrate on the task before you. All answers will come with that.
M	PERSEUS	Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion.
M	AMOUN	A fierce group. Trained to fight... Amoun's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we --

M	AMOUN (V.0.)	. They've been chasing Djinn Raiders in the mountains for years.
M	PERSEUS (V.0.)	Djinn Raiders?
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly insane. They fight like Hades himself is keeping score... From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	.. That's how the Desert Legion came to be called 'God-slayers.' I'm not ashamed to say I'll be relieved to have their protection the rest of the way... Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout magically where there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS -- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock. Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on
M	TIAMAT	My loyal friend. it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one. Events demand more decisive action. Kalibos' SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body --
M	KALIBOS	Grorashnrd... I to be... ruler... rhodirs... made whole... sovfrenty... kingdom mine...
M	TIAMAT	Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh when I restore you to your rightful form -- proud Acrisius. With me, your protector, on the throne of Olympos... the violator Zeus deposed. Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction.
M	TIAMAT	Go down into this valley. See what I am building for you -- an army dangerous and fearless as you, their leader. petals and chew them. The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from Andromeda. Peshet races out.
M	FANTASOS	How much are we meant to suffer? Where is your mighty King? Safely cloistered above the flood... on the high ground, with the high- born -- the privileged gentry!... The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
M	FANTASOS	. Does Kepheus worry about you? No! Only the Princessa... And still, the Kraken comes! Does the King build his defenses at the water's edge? "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself stage.
M	AGENOR	No! He makes his stand at his daughter's chamber door!... We will show Kepheus we're not sacrificial fodder. We will tremble the walls of his Basilica! RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,
M	HER POV	at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches
M	AGENOR (O.S.)	Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants! We die so she may live... As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears.
M	FANTASOS	Peshet, you've come at the right time. Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods,
M	FANTASOS	One night soon, a gong will sound three times. When you hear it, unlock the back gate of the Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's chambers... . and bring the Princess out. My men will take her to Leviathan. Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.
M	FANTASOS	Do you understand me? Peshet, do you understand how important your part is? She nods, horrified by her predicament.
M	AMOUN	You wanted to know about Djinn Raiders. Here they are.
M	DRACO	Look sharp. Watch your surround.
M	VIDALIA	The Alkali Lotus... She stops, spotting something in the distance. Kosmo
M	VIDALIA	What is that?
M	THEIR POV	shimmering through the desert heat -- tents and flags. An army bivouac... flying the flag of Joppa. Its the Cleon Legion.
M	DRACO	Where is everyone? Spyros HEARS something and follows the SOUND to a tent, Spyros, uneasy, backs out.
M	L	Spyros comes out.
M	SPYROS	Draco, tell me what this -- Everyone is standing perfectly still. DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion creatures: LOTOPHAGI.
M	CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT	as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands the air around Perseus. Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We should leave... now.
M	PERSEUS	I won't do anything rash. I've learned my lesson.
M	VIDALIA	This time you must do something rash. We all must. Kalibos leans close to Perseus.
M	KALIBOS	Tosharicana... demigod... expulsotat... Zeusl
M	PERSEUS	No... Perseus. PERSEUS WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD. The whole Expedition comes THE LOTOPHAGI ATTACK, swift and brutal. Long arms thrash Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES.
M	AMOUN	Muster to me! Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun
M	AMOUN	Come on! You can pass through! Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks back at Kosmo in horror. Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's the corpse into the protected circle. The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the
M	AMOUN	Only humans can penetrate the shield! Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm,
M	PERSEUS	Only humans... He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, toward the barrier.
M	PERSEUS	Drop the barrier! r
M	AMOUN	No! It's too late for her!
M	PERSEUS	Drop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
M	PERSEUS	Take the barrier down or I'll go through it!
M	AMOUN	Have you learned nothing? If you break out now, we're all at risk. On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.
M	PERSEUS	I've learned one thing for certain! Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.
M	PERSEUS	Get down! Perseus backs away three steps. To the others --
M	PERSEUS	Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.
M	DRACO	Let's kill these freks! Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling look: "You're the one that I want." They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges, Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite.

M	VIDALIA	To save me, you risked everything -- your mission, your friends... the fate of multitudes. Men need better judgment in the one who is meant to lead them... No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.
M	VIDALIA	You shouldn't have risked your life for me. It is a waste to save me when I'll be gone so soon. She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.
M	VIDALIA	Thank you for your reckless disregard. Thank you, Perseus... Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus. Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and stomach.
M	VIDALIA	The poison is gone now.

M	PERSEUS	But I thought the Djinn...
M	VIDALIA .	We all did. But their leader, Shaikh Suleiman, has some special interest in you. Just sleep. She waves her palm over his face, and he does sleep. suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature, spooked, sniffs the air. All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel surveying the battlefield.
M	DRACO	The Skolothians have suffered more than their share in this war. The Legions of the Gods have battered them.
M	SPYROS	It's no wonder they shy away from all strangers. Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is
M	PERSEUS L	Why does this Djinn priest stay with us?
M	AMOUN	Because of you. You're the reason they saved us.
M	PERSEUS	Me? I don't understand.
M	AMOUN	Why don't you ask him?
M	PERSEUS	I thought they didn't speak.
M	AMOUN	They have no mouths. That doesn't mean they do not speak.
M	AMOUN	The Pillar of Moirai. Lair of the Norn Sisters.
M	PERSEUS	Tell me of them.
M	AMOUN	They're witches in the form of Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a Strix. They have powerful magic and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters, among other things. But they owe me a favor. When the war broke out, they lent their power to men against the Gods in exchange for infant sacrifice. Tiamat struck them blind for their treachery. When they came for help, I fashioned them an artificial eye, for their Second Sight.
M	PERSEUS	You made only one eye?
M	AMOUN	Yes. They have to take turns. If they all could see at once, they would be invincible, which one cannot risk in beings so grotesque. OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a

M	PERSEUS	I hear you and I understand you. But I don't know how.
M	SHAIKH SULEIMAN	Moi ne epos ae'prositi, mene daeva.
M	PERSEUS	You are praying to me? There must be a mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has

M	PERSEUS	You honor my father? You honor Spyros?
M	SHAIKH SULEIMAN	Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus... Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger. A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and
M	URD	Amoun... So sorry to see you again.
M	AMOUN	Likewise, Urd. I seek your counsel. You want us to tell you about Leviathan.
M	AMOUN	You know already... of course.
M	VERDANDI	We know this -- the Kraken cannot be defeated. You've wasted a journey. I trust it was not a taxing one. The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos irritation.
M	AMOUN	Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness. You owe me this answer at least.
M	URD	The Sisters owe nothing to you or any Man! She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention
M	VERDANDI	There's something wrong with that one. I don't like having him here.
M	SKULD	Let me take a look. Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and
M	PERSEUS	Tell us what we want to know or your Eye has seen its last. The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers.
M	VERDANDI	You've brought a thief into our nest!
M	URD	A villain!
M	SKULD	Scum!
M	AMOUN	No, good Sisters... the son of Zeus. The Strix react in horror and all land on the same monolith.
M	PERSEUS	Since you cannot see, let me tell you what's about to happen. I'm about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks far below. I fear its journey will be a taxing one. The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia, Strix are panicked --
M	URD	We can't tell you. We don't dare betray Tiamat again.
M	VERDANDI	She sees all! Her touch is felt in every evil thing!
M	SKULD	A second offense and she will
M	PERSEUS	You don't have to tell us the secret. But you will have to live as blind as she made you.
M	SKULD	No! Give us the Eye and we'll tell.
M	PERSEUS	Tell me first. If I like the answer, you get your Eye.
M	VERDANDI	We need the Eye to see the answer!
M	AMOUN	You know the answer sure as you already knew the question. The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings.
M	SKULD	Leviathan can be destroyed...

M	AMOUN	The Rape of Medusa? Everyone falls silent. The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous.
M	THAD	With respect, Magi, do not recite that black tale. You'll bring the sky down upon us.
M	SPYROS	Does a fairy tale frighten you, soldier? Thad looks at him, sharply.
M	DRACO	Tell the story, sir. My men fear only one thing -- to let fear in their hearts. Mongke says something that means, "Go ahead already."
M	AMOUN	Medusa was a tender young woman once -- a mortal creature of such rare beauty as to tempt even the Gods. One night, on the road home, she caught the eye of the God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set the Void.
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	She hastened to hallowed ground, thinking the Goddess Tiamat would protect her in her temple. But the God Set followed. A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in His cloak ripples as SHAPES PUSH THROUGH THE SPECTRAL
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	He ravished her on the cold floor. She felt the heartless passion of a God.
M	SAME SCENE - LATER	Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	Despoiled and broken in the shadow of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage... But the Goddess of the Deep regarded Medusa with disdain. The prayers of such a frail and filthy mortal angered Tiamat. A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her
M	AMOUN (V.0.)	The Goddess twisted young Medusa into a loathsome new thing... The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs The Expedition all hang on Amoun's every word.

M	AMOUN	Charon's ferry.
M	CHARON	Better stoke those fires, boys, it's going to get cold soon.
M	VIDALIA	She's got a tail and she'll use it just like that. Perseus opens his eyes.
M	VIDALIA	Keep your eyes shut! Open them with Medusa and it will be your last look. You're enjoying this too much.
M	CONTINUED:	He can't see her smile. Or that she regards him with something hotter than amusement. She tries to punch him,
M	VIDALIA	Good! Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks him down.
M	VIDALIA	Do you think the Gorgon will hit once and then surrender her head? He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive
M	VIDALIA	Listen... you will hear her muscles coil. Feel her hunger in your gut. Ask, how will she feed it?
M	PERSEUS	I wish it, but I can't perceive the world that way.
M	VIDALIA	You can. You're the son of a God.
M	PERSEUS	Nothing I have done has convinced me of that.
M	VIDALIA	You do not see yourself clearly yet. In time, your actions in crisis will sharpen your view. Her faith touches him deeply. She resumes the lesson:
M	VIDALIA	You can do those things, Perseus, and much more. He shadows her movements more closely, back and forth.
M	VIDALIA	We think a room is silent until someone points out the wind. Then the wind is all we hear. She strikes. He dodges and locks her neck. Pleased, she
M	CONTINUED:	Surprisingly, he lands on his feet, and immediately
M	PERSEUS	I'm beginning to hear the wind. Vidalia... why are you afraid? She kisses him, deeply. He returns it. Suddenly, she
M	PERSEUS	Wait... She is already climbing the ladder. She stops for only a
M	VIDALIA	You've learned enough for now.
M	PERSEUS	What?
M	SPYROS	Nothing.
M	PERSEUS	What do you see?
M	SPYROS	A look I know well.
M	PERSEUS	From me?
M	SPYROS	Never before.
M	PERSEUS	Then where? Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus'

M	KEPHEUS	The relief fleet is lost. Monsters gather outside our walls. Soon I won't be able to keep my own people at bay. And still, no word from the Expedition. Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the on the plain outside the city. BONFIRES RAGE, monster
M	KEPHEUS	Tiamat commands a massive horde. How many days remain?
M	MINISTER OF DEFENSE	Four, Majesty... Kepheus lowers the glass, looking grim.
M	GENERAL ANDOR	Our forces prepare. We have cards yet to play. We'll buy the time we need until...
M	KEPHEUS	Until the Expedition perhaps returns?... Until we're saved by the fisherman's son?
M	MINISTER OF DEFENSE	My king, remember and take hope... he is not truly the son of a fisherman. From your lips, I pray, to his true father's ear. Andromeda has appeared. All are shocked to see her. She
F	ANDROMEDA	I would speak with the King in private.
M	MINISTER OF DEFENSE	Princess, let us find a protected
F	ANDROMEDA	We can speak here, in the elements our subjects endure. The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away,
M	KEPHEUS	They take refuge from the Lower Wharf. A sight I wish you'd never seen.
F	ANDROMEDA	You've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world.
M	KEPHEUS	I would have it no other way.
F	ANDROMEDA	And I thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth. But now, with Mother so... It's time I shared this burden you've carried so long. Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around her.
M	KEPHEUS	You make me proud, but you are only a child... my little one.
F	ANDROMEDA	No, no longer. Your protection of me has brought hardship to our people...
M	ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)	and to me, perhaps, new understanding. I must ask you something, Father. She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city.
F	ANDROMEDA	If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act, would you do it?
M	KEPHEUS	To save my people, yes, of course.
F	ANDROMEDA	Such an act is within my power. He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed.
M	KEPH EUS	Stop itl I forbid you to entertain such thoughts.
F	ANDROMEDA	Perseus and the others were willing to give everything.
M	KEPHEUS	Listen to me. By the time this is over, your mother and I may well be gone. But I guarantee the day is coming when Joppa will know glory under Queen Andromeda. She embraces him, head upon his shoulder, where he can't
F	ANDROMEDA	Be at peace, Father, I will not cause you any more sadness than I already have.
M	REMAINING	The exhausted Expedition is now six: Perseus, Vidalia, Amoun, Spyros, Mongke, and Tamburlane. They've stopped at a well beside a MILESTONE. Spyros studies the ancient words carved into the Eleven stadia to the South... What is 'Polis of Jove Pater'? I'm ignorant of this.
M	AMOUN	Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus was known. This milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities. Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker as
M	AMOUN	'The Polis of Jove Pater' is the ancient name of --
M	PERSEUS	-- Joppa.
M	AMOUN	Yes, Joppa... once the most sacred site in the worship of Jove.
M	PERSEUS	Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage. She compels the people to make human sacrifice of the Princess Andromeda...
M	AMOUN	. and transforms Joppa into the new church of Tiamat. The ancient abode of Zeus... becomes the new home of Tiamat, granting her sway to supplant him as the God of Gods. You can't allow Tiamat to rule Olympos. Perseus holds her look. "No," he won't let that happen.
M	PERSEUS	Father, we've seen much on this journey we cannot hold in our hands. Yet these things are real enough. At each turn, we find monsters and Gods.
M	SPYROS	Yes, the evidence is everywhere once we leave our island. That's why I so rarely leave. These Gods, what do you make of them?
M	PERSEUS	As you always said, they're petty, vengeful... and dangerous.
M	SPYROS	Yes, as bad as men. And would you have that sort guide your life?
M	PERSEUS	No. Men must be accountable to themselves. Otherwise we serve poor masters.
M	SPYROS	That's my boy. Amoun rides up.
M	AMOUN	We should stop for the night.
M	PERSEUS	We must keep moving. Time is running out.
M	SPYROS	If we don't rest the horses, they won't make it to Joppa. We all need rest. If you don't save yourself, you'll have nothing left when you face the Kraken. Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
M	PERSEUS	Vidalia! Perseus slides from his horse and follows her. Mongke
M	AMOUN	Why don't we stop here tonight? Spyros smiles, looking off after Perseus. THROUGH A STAND OF TREES, Vidalia appears again, and
M	VIDALIA	I know this place... Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.
M	VIDALIA	This is my church. Where I was born to the world. Where my people prayed to me.
M	PERSEUS	Who were they? I know they were humans. They seemed so fragile. I sheltered them because I thought the harsh world would break them. Now I know I underestimated them. Her eyes pierce Perseus.
M	VIDALIA	When I saw you come out with Medusa's head, I saw that a Man had done an impossible thing. Beautiful, yes, but not fragile. Resilient. Fearless.
M	PERSEUS	I was mad with fear. I was no hero. I just didn't want to die. Perseus turns toward the altar.
M	PERSEUS	What is this? A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced.
M	VIDALIA	When the war began, Men ranged through the hills, stamping out any trace of God-worship they found. My true name was carved here. When it was obliterated, my worshippers lost faith and my last season began.
M	PERSEUS	How long do you have?
M	VIDALIA	Only days.
M	PERSEUS	What will happen?
M	VIDALIA	I will vanish, quick as dew evaporating at dawn.
M	VIDALIA (CONT'D)	No one will notice the moment because all thought of me will be gone.
M	PERSEUS	What about me?
M	VIDALIA	Nothing can save me.
M	PERSEUS	I don't believe that. Will love not buy another day, Vidalia? I was cut free of earthly longing. Why did you have to give me a name? The light is almost gone now. They kiss. The wilted blossoms in her crown slowly open with color. They begin
M	PERSEUS	When you vanish, I'll find you.
M	VIDALIA	Close your eyes. 1
M	PERSEUS	I'd rather look at you.
M	VIDALIA	Do what I tell you. I'm going to give you a spell.
M	PERSEUS	Don't give away your secrets. You still have need of them.
M	VIDALIA	Let me give you this sliver of magic. I'll write it on your instinct. When the time comes, you'll know how to use it. She takes his head in her hands, pressing her forehead to In QUICK FLASHES: A white lid opens to a black eye. Feathered WHITE WINGS beat the air. Then: Racing over the surface of a blue SEA, and then down,
M	TIAMAT	How did he do this? They were not even to reach Medusa.
M	SET	Fate has begun to shift. The future ripples with uncertainty.
M	TIAMAT	Spare me your pitiful maundering! There is no Fate beyond my actions and no uncertainty in the face of my will. I meant only that the demigod bends the path without knowing it. He is ignorant of the rules, or unconcerned with them. She turns on him with such a violent look, he flinches.
M	TIAMAT	Then there shall be no rules! Prove to me you have not lost that which makes you most valuable. Set absorbs her tirade, stung.
M	SET	And Zeus... the others?
M	TIAMAT	I am your ally. That is all you need to know. Bloody your hands and rid me of this pestilence.
M	SET	You have liberated me, my Queen. Watch as your desires are quickly satisfied. Set disappears.
M	PERSEUS	Where is she?
M	AMOUN	This is my fault. I've permitted .this infatuation to progress too far.
M	PERSEUS	It is not yours to permit, Master... with respect. Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of
M	VIDALIA	Look what I've found for us -- She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries. Have you forgotten Perseus is engaged to the Princessa?
M	PERSEUS	I won't marry Andromeda. Both Amoun and Vidalia are surprised.
M	AMOUN	If by some miracle you survive this encounter with Leviathan, the hand of the Princessa is your reward.
M	PERSEUS	I want no reward.

M	PESHET	My lady, please --
F	ANDROMEDA	I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me.
M	PESHET	Princessa, give me your hand. Andromeda, please. Please.
F	ANDROMEDA	I'm not afraid anymore. I will do what I must. I will die so that they may live.

M	SPYROS	If it should come to pass, tell your mother and sister I loved them much. Perseus reaches out and touches his foster father warmly.
M	PERSEUS	You'll have to tell them yourself. Vidalia's voice has become weaker.
M	VIDALIA	The people are frightened. But they can triumph.. They need only one thing. Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell me... 11

M	PERSEUS	Yes.

M	PERSEUS	Yes.
M	ZEUS	Would you choose to condemn Men, your own people, to suffer more of this devastating War?
M	PERSEUS	I have no people. You have stranded me between realms, neither man nor God. Do you reproach Zeus?
M	PERSEUS	No. I thank you... Father. Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
M	PERSEUS	You have freed me. I will not be a pawn for Men or Gods.
M	ZEUS	Does that absolve you suddenly of your responsibilities?
M	PERSEUS	You've made me understand that my responsibility is to myself. So it is with us all. You've put me to a great test. In the midst of it, I found the courage in my heart to defy Gods. I do not know how much of that comes from you, Father... and how much from my Mother, who I never knew. Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.
M	PERSEUS	It matters not. Whatever the source, I are only grateful. He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human throng.
