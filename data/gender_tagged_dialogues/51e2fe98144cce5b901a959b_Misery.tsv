M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	PAUL	Still got it.
M	SINDELL (O.S.)	What's that?
M	PAUL	An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
F	SINDELL	It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
M	PAUL	When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
F	SINDELL	You're still a writer.
M	PAUL	I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
F	SINDELL	Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
M	PAUL	Marcia, please.
F	SINDELL	No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
M	PAUL	Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
F	SINDELL	I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
M	PAUL	Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? I'm doing this because I have to. Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ... I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
F	ANNIE	You hear me--Breathe! I said breathe!!!
M	PAUL	...where... am I...?
F	ANNIE	Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
M	PAUL	How long...?
F	ANNIE	You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
M	PAUL	--my number one fan.
F	ANNIE	That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here. Take these.
F	ANNIE	Here.
M	PAUL	What are they...?
F	ANNIE	They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
M	PAUL	Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
F	ANNIE	The blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
F	ANNIE	Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've got to rest, you almost died.
M	ANNIE (O.S.)	Open wide.
F	ANNIE	Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they? It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
M	PAUL	Will I be able to walk?
F	ANNIE	Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there. But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
F	ANNIE	It's not nearly as bad as it looks. You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the left leg is fractured too. I could hear the bones moving, so it's best for your legs to remain immobile. And as soon as the roads open, I'll take you to a hospital.
F	ANNIE	In the meantime, you've got a lot of recovering to do, and I consider it an honor that you'll do it in my home.
F	SINDELL	This is Marcia Sindell calling from New York City. I'd like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police or the Sheriff. Which one do you want?
F	SINDELL	Whichever one's not busy.
M	BUSTER	I'm pretty sure they 're both not busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're both me. I also happen to be President of the Policeman's Benefit Association, Chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse; call me Buster, everybody does, what can I do for you?
F	SINDELL	I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
M	BUSTER	Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
F	SINDELL	Yes.
M	BUSTER	He's your client, huh?
F	SINDELL	Yes, he is.
M	BUSTER	People sure like those Misery books.
F	SINDELL	I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
M	BUSTER	Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
F	SINDELL	Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
M	BUSTER	I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
F	SINDELL	No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
M	BUSTER	You think he might be missing?
F	SINDELL	I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
M	BUSTER	Just a little over-protective, maybe. Tell you what--nothing's been reported out here-- --but I'll put his name through our system. And if anything turns up, I'll call you right away.
F	SINDELL	I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
M	BUSTER	G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
F	VIRGINIA	We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
M	BUSTER	Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard?
F	VIRGINIA	Four or five days ago. Why?
M	BUSTER	...no reason...
M	PAUL'S VOICE	I guess it was kind of a miracle... you finding me...
F	ANNIE	No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
M	PAUL	Following me?
F	ANNIE	Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin-- his neck; this next is said with total and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
M	PAUL	Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
F	ANNIE	Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
M	PAUL	I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
F	ANNIE	Lucky for you, I did. Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
F	ANNIE	I know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of them. I love them so.
M	PAUL	You're very kind...
F	ANNIE	And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. Like a baby. All done.
M	PAUL	When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
F	ANNIE	It shouldn't be too much longer. Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you. Could I ask you a favor? I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... and I wondered if maybe...
M	PAUL	You want to read it?
F	ANNIE	If you wouldn't mind.
M	PAUL	I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
F	ANNIE	You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
F	ANNIE	Boy, it's like clockwork, the way your pain comes--I'll get you your Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy.
F	ANNIE	What's your new book called?
M	PAUL	I don't have a title yet.
F	ANNIE	What's it about?
M	PAUL	It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
F	ANNIE	Oh, like I could do that?
M	LIBBY	Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
M	BUSTER	Maybe you can, Libby.
M	LIBBY	No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
M	BUSTER	No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
M	LIBBY	I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
M	BUSTER	So do I...
M	LIBBY	I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
M	BUSTER	I'm sure you're right.
F	ANNIE	I know I'm only forty pages into your book, but...
M	PAUL	But what?
F	ANNIE	Nothing.
M	PAUL	No, what is it?
F	ANNIE	Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
M	PAUL	I can take it, go ahead.
F	ANNIE	Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
M	PAUL	Pretty rough so far.
F	ANNIE	The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.
M	PAUL	The profanity bothers you?
F	ANNIE	It has no nobility.
M	PAUL	Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
F	ANNIE	They do not. What do you think I say when I go to the feed store in town? "Now, Wally, give me a bag of that effing pigfeed and ten pounds of that bitchly cow-corn"--
F	ANNIE	--and in the bank do I tell Mrs. Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard of a check, give me some of your Christing money."
F	ANNIE	There! Look there! See what you made me do!
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Sometimes I get so worked up. Can you ever forgive me? Here...
F	ANNIE	I love you, Paul. Your mind. Your creativity--that's all I meant.
F	VIRGINIA	This sure is fun.
M	BUSTER	Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
F	VIRGINIA	Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
M	BUSTER	Stop--stop right here.
F	VIRGINIA	What? What is it?
M	BUSTER	Look at that broken branch there...
F	VIRGINIA	Could be the weight of the snow.
M	BUSTER	Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
F	VIRGINIA	Anything down there?
M	BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.)	Yeah. An enormous amount of snow.
F	VIRGINIA	You really think Sheldon's out there?
M	BUSTER	Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
F	ANNIE	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
M	PAUL	It's fine.
F	ANNIE	They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
M	PAUL	Then the roads are open...
F	ANNIE	The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
M	PAUL	The phones are working?
F	ANNIE	Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning. What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
M	PAUL	My daughter must be going nuts.
F	ANNIE	...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
M	PAUL	I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
F	ANNIE	Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul, what a poet you are...
F	ANNIE	I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page
M	PAUL	I guess that means it's okay.
F	ANNIE	No. No, it isn't, it's-- --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
M	PAUL	I can live with "great."
F	ANNIE	No, it's not just great, it's perfect, a perfect, perfect thing.
F	ANNIE	I'm up to page 185. I always get sad when I pass the halfway point. Will you do me a favor? I'd love it if you would autograph my copy. I already have your autograph on a picture, but it would mean so much to me to get it in person. I know you're right- handed, so don't worry if it's not so legible. I'll cherish it anyway.
F	ANNIE	I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
M	PAUL	Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
F	ANNIE	I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
M	PAUL	You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
F	ANNIE	Thank you so much.
M	PAUL	My pleasure.
F	ANNIE	I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
M	PAUL	Misery?
F	ANNIE	Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
M	PAUL	I'm getting to believe you.
F	ANNIE	This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
M	PAUL	She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
F	ANNIE	I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
M	PAUL	The Sistine Chapel?
F	ANNIE	Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
F	ANNIE	Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!
F	ANNIE	When my husband left me... I wasn't prepared, it wasn't an easy time...
F	ANNIE	For a while I thought I might go crazy.
M	PAUL	I know how that can be.
F	ANNIE	I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems. 'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
M	PAUL	Yeah, well...
F	ANNIE	I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
M	PAUL	I'm...
F	ANNIE	Done?
M	PAUL	Yeah, thanks.
F	ANNIE	No problem.
F	ANNIE	Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
M	PAUL	Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
F	ANNIE	It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
F	ANNIE	I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
M	PAUL	Well, I hope you like it.
F	ANNIE	Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
F	ANNIE	You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
M	PAUL	Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
F	ANNIE	I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
M	PAUL	I DIDN'T...
F	ANNIE	Then who did?
M	PAUL	No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
F	ANNIE	She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
F	ANNIE	I thought you were good, Paul, but you're not good, you're just another lying old dirty birdie and I don't think I better be around you for awhile. And don't even think about anybody coming for you, not the doctors, not your agent, not your family--because I never called them. Nobody knows you're here. And you better hope nothing happens to me because if I die, you die.
M	BUSTER	No, Ms. Sindell, there's no point in coming up here now. Everything that can be done is... Yes, we're working closely with the state police, and the FBI has been informed. Right... Right... As soon as we know anything we'll let you know. No, it's no bother. Call anytime. Bye, Ms. Sindell.
F	VIRGINIA	Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls?
M	BUSTER	Just from his agent. thing..."
F	ANNIE	What are you doing on the floor? It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. causes considerable I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
M	PAUL	Perfect.
F	ANNIE	You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
M	PAUL	I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
F	ANNIE	I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
F	ANNIE	But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
M	PAUL	Show me the way?
F	ANNIE	Yes.
M	PAUL	When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing.
F	ANNIE	Paul, this is no time for jokes. You must rid the world of this filth.
M	PAUL	You want me to burn my book?
F	ANNIE	Yes.
M	PAUL	You want me to burn my book?
F	ANNIE	I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
M	PAUL	This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
F	ANNIE	Then light the match, Paul.
M	PAUL	No big deal.
F	ANNIE	So you've indicated. Do it.
F	ANNIE	I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
M	PAUL	You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. God knows you're entitled to it.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
M	PAUL	You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
F	ANNIE	As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
F	ANNIE	Can't you see it's what God wants?
F	ANNIE	You're so brilliant. I would think you'd certainly be able to see that. We're put on this earth to help people, Paul. Like I'm trying to help you.
F	ANNIE	Please let me help you.
F	ANNIE	You're doing the right thing, Paul.
F	ANNIE	Goodness!
F	ANNIE	Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious--
F	ANNIE	Well, isn't that an oogy mess?
M	BUSTER	That's the Steadman place up there. The only other place up here is the Wilkes farm. That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing else out this way--circle on back.
F	ANNIE	I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
M	PAUL	I don't know.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
M	PAUL	Great.
F	ANNIE	See, isn't this nice?
M	PAUL	Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
F	ANNIE	And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
M	PAUL	If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
F	ANNIE	Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
M	PAUL	Set what up?
F	ANNIE	That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
M	PAUL	Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
F	ANNIE	Oh, but Paul! I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at-- --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
M	PAUL	Misery's Return?
F	ANNIE	I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
F	ANNIE	Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it. Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world... You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
F	ANNIE	I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
M	PAUL	You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
F	ANNIE	I have total confidence in your brilliance--besides, the view will inspire you.
F	ANNIE	You just inhale that. I'll be right back.
M	PAUL	I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
F	ANNIE	Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
M	PAUL	Great.
F	ANNIE	I got you this expensive paper to type on.
F	ANNIE	And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
M	PAUL	It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
F	ANNIE	You--fooler...! Did I do good?
M	PAUL	You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
F	ANNIE	But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
M	PAUL	C'mere, I'll show you.
F	ANNIE	Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
M	PAUL	I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
F	ANNIE	Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
M	PAUL	No, just the paper will be fine.
F	ANNIE	Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
M	PAUL	Annie, what's the matter?
F	ANNIE	What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
M	PAUL	Shit...
M	PAUL	You've written how to do this--now do it!
M	PAUL	What do you know, it actually works.
M	PAUL	What a surprise.
M	PAUL	Operator... ...OPERATOR... ...Shit!
M	PAUL	You crazy bitch...
M	ANNIE (V.O.)	Paul, I've got your paper.
F	ANNIE	Just the kind you asked for.
F	ANNIE	Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
M	PAUL	You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
F	ANNIE	Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
M	PAUL	I want my pills NOW!
F	ANNIE	It'll only take a second.
M	PAUL	I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie-- you can't tell if she's buying it or --please...
F	ANNIE	It just breaks my heart to see you like this...
M	ANNIE (O.S.)	I've done a lot of thinking on the drive...
F	ANNIE	...and I'm absolutely convinced that the main reason I've never been more popular is because of my temper. You must be so mad at me. The truth now.
M	PAUL	Well, I don't hold grudges. After all, who doesn't let off a little steam once in a while.
F	ANNIE	My genius needs his rest before he writes.
F	ANNIE	Here, in case you think of any ideas.
M	PAUL	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
F	ANNIE	Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
F	ANNIE	I have faith in you... ...my darling...
F	ANNIE	Catch this-- --ummmm-wahhhh.
M	BUSTER	Walter, we could be skipping lunch today.
M	STATE POLICE CHIEF	The presumption must now be that Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he somehow crawled out of his car. But we have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash. We also know if anyone had found him, they would have taken him to an area hospital. His body is undoubtedly out there buried somewhere in the snow. We'll find him after the first thaw--unless the animals have gotten to him first. I'll take questions.
F	VIRGINIA	You don't think he's dead, do you?
M	BUSTER	He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
F	VIRGINIA	It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
M	BUSTER	There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
F	ANNIE	Don't be nervous-- --just remember, I'll treasure whatever you do.
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
M	PAUL	What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
F	ANNIE	Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
M	PAUL	I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
F	ANNIE	Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
M	PAUL	--not fair?
F	ANNIE	That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
M	PAUL	--cliff-hangers--
F	ANNIE	I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know. Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered-- --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
F	ANNIE	"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
M	PAUL	They always cheated like that in cliff-- --chapter plays.
F	ANNIE	But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
M	PAUL	Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden for an editor, here.
F	ANNIE	What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
M	PAUL	I can't write this anymore.
F	ANNIE	Don't be silly. Of course you can.
M	PAUL	I'm telling you, I can't.
F	ANNIE	You can--you have the "gotta"--
M	PAUL	The what?
F	ANNIE	The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
M	PAUL	I said that?
F	ANNIE	You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
M	PAUL	What about a bee...?
F	ANNIE	What?
M	PAUL	Nothing.
M	PAUL	Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
F	ANNIE	You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
F	ANNIE	--and when Gravedigger Wilkes remembered how thirty years earlier, the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde-- --and then old Dr. Cleary deduced that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter because of the rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart just leapt.
F	ANNIE	I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
M	PAUL	Yeah, yeah...
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s. Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
M	PAUL	...have to wait.
F	ANNIE	Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
M	PAUL	Have to wait.
F	ANNIE	Not even a hint?
F	ANNIE	Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records-- --you do like Liberace, don't you?
M	PAUL	Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
F	ANNIE	I'm going to play my records all day
M	LONG	--to inspire you--he's my all-time favorite.
M	PAUL	Annie?
M	PAUL	Would you have dinner with me tonight?
M	PAUL	To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
M	PAUL	Jesus Christ.
F	VIRGINIA	No, he's not here. I don't know where he went. He never tells me anything anymore. He's probably out having an affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I think I hear him coming.
F	VIRGINIA	It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know who you've been having an affair with.
M	BUSTER	Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
F	VIRGINIA	Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
M	BUSTER	Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
F	VIRGINIA	What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
M	BUSTER	Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
F	ANNIE	I hope you like it.
M	PAUL	It looks wonderful. And so do you.
F	ANNIE	Oh...
M	PAUL	I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
F	ANNIE	My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
M	PAUL	Oh. You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
M	PAUL	Annie, I think we should have a toast.
F	ANNIE	A toast?
M	PAUL	Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
F	ANNIE	To Misery.
M	PAUL	Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
F	ANNIE	Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
M	PAUL	Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
F	ANNIE	Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
M	PAUL	Well, it certainly says you.
F	ANNIE	You really think so?
M	PAUL	Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
F	ANNIE	Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
M	PAUL	It's perfect.
M	PAUL	To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who brought her back to life.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul, every time I think about it, I get goosebumps.
F	ANNIE	Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one. Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
M	PAUL	To Misery.
F	ANNIE	Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
M	PAUL	I think you're right.
F	ANNIE	I think it's so wonderful that Misery would sacrifice her title to take up the cause of her people. That's true nobility.
F	ANNIE	Here's your pills.
M	PAUL	Annie, what is it?
F	ANNIE	The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
F	ANNIE	When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian. I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
M	PAUL	Why would you lose me?
F	ANNIE	The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
M	PAUL	Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
F	ANNIE	That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
M	PAUL	It is.
F	ANNIE	I have this gun, and sometimes I think about using it.
F	ANNIE	I better go now. I might put bullets in it.
M	BUSTER	"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
F	VIRGINIA	What?
M	BUSTER	They're hauling Misery into court.
F	VIRGINIA	That's nice.
M	BUSTER	"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
M	PAUL	Holy shit.
F	ANNIE	Paul, I know you've been out.
M	PAUL	What?
F	ANNIE	You've been out of your room.
M	PAUL	No, I haven't.
F	ANNIE	Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
M	PAUL	I don't know what you're talking about.
F	ANNIE	Is this what you're looking for? I know you've been out twice, Paul. At first, I couldn't figure out how you did it, but last night I found your key. I know I left my scrapbook out, and I can imagine what you might be thinking of me. But you see, Paul, it's all okay.
F	ANNIE	Last night it came so clear. I realize you just need more time. Eventually, you'll come to accept the idea of being here. Paul, do you know about the early days at the Kimberly Diamond Mine? Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds? Don't worry, they didn't kill them. That would be like junking a Mercedes just because it had a broken spring-- no, if they caught them they had to make sure they could go on working, but they also had to make sure they could never run away. The operation was called hobbling.
M	PAUL	Annie, whatever you're thinking about, don't do it.
F	ANNIE	Now don't fuss, Paul.
M	PAUL	Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
M	PAUL	Didn't you? Why would I leave a place where I'm doing my best work? It doesn't make any sense.
F	ANNIE	Shh, darling, trust me-- It's for the best.
M	PAUL	Annie, for God's sake, please.
F	ANNIE	Almost done, just one more.
F	ANNIE	God, I love you...
M	BUSTER	Just leave it, all right?
F	VIRGINIA	Oh, I like that tone.
M	BUSTER	How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here. Where the hell is that thing?
F	VIRGINIA	What thing?
M	BUSTER	That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
F	VIRGINIA	What is it?
M	BUSTER	I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
F	VIRGINIA	It's good you found it.
M	BUSTER	There's that spice again.
M	BUSTER	Interesting.
F	ANNIE	Hi, Punkin.
F	ANNIE	Give us a smile? Such a kidder.
M	BUSTER	Hey, Pete.
M	PETE	Buster.
M	BUSTER	Answer me a couple things?
M	PETE	If I can.
M	BUSTER	Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
M	PETE	We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
M	BUSTER	You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
M	PETE	Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
M	BUSTER	Has she been buying any odd things lately?
M	PETE	Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.
M	BUSTER	Newspapers?
M	PETE	No, the typing kind.
M	BUSTER	Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
F	ANNIE	Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
M	PAUL	I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
F	ANNIE	Don't talk to me like that.
M	PAUL	Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot.
F	ANNIE	Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
M	PAUL	Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
F	ANNIE	I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
M	PAUL	Be my guest.
F	ANNIE	That's disgusting.
F	ANNIE	I don't think I'll ever understand you. I cook your meals, I tend to you practically twenty-four hours a day, and you continue to fight me. When are we going to develop a sense of trust?
F	ANNIE	Oh, my!
M	BUSTER	Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
F	ANNIE	Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
M	BUSTER	I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
F	ANNIE	What do you want to know?
M	BUSTER	Anything you can tell me might help.
F	ANNIE	Well, he was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, the only child of Franklin and Helene Sheldon, mediocre student, majored in history...
M	BUSTER	Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
F	ANNIE	I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection... ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
M	BUSTER	Thank you.
F	ANNIE	'Course you must know about that horrible accident.
F	ANNIE	Almost killed me, too. I prayed when I heard the news. I got down on my knees and begged for it not to be true.
F	ANNIE	You're going to laugh at what I'm about to say, but go ahead, I don't care... ...when I was praying, God told me to get ready.
M	BUSTER	Get ready for what?
F	ANNIE	To try and be his replacement--he gave so much pleasure to so many people and there's a shortage of pleasure on this planet these days, in case you hadn't noticed.
F	ANNIE	God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
M	BUSTER	Sure.
F	ANNIE	It's right this way.
F	ANNIE	It's right here. I knew how he wrote, the kinds of words he used, the wonderful stories he told-- --I've spent the last four weeks trying to write like Paul Sheldon. But I can't do it right. I try and I try and I know all the words-- --but it's just not the same.
M	BUSTER	Well... ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
F	ANNIE	I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
M	BUSTER	I'm not much of a critic.
F	ANNIE	Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
M	BUSTER	Sure.
F	ANNIE	How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
M	BUSTER	Sounds good.
F	ANNIE	There's some already made.
M	BUSTER	Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
F	ANNIE	I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
M	BUSTER	You got a point there...
F	ANNIE	Here you are.
M	BUSTER	Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
F	ANNIE	But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
M	BUSTER	I'm sure it's wonderful, but really should be getting back.
M	BUSTER	If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
F	ANNIE	I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
M	BUSTER	Miz Wilkes, are you all right?
M	BUSTER	Miz Wilkes?
M	PAUL	Here. I'm down here. Down here.
M	BUSTER	Mr. Sheldon?
F	ANNIE	Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to happen. I've been waiting for this sign.
F	ANNIE	I've known for some time why I was chosen to save you. You and I were meant to be together forever. But But don't worry, Paul. I've already prepared for what must be done. I put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for me. Oh, darling, it will be so beautiful.
F	ANNIE	Now don't be afraid. I love you.
M	PAUL	I know you do. I love you too, Annie. And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
F	ANNIE	But the time is now. Soon others will come.
M	PAUL	It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
F	ANNIE	Here, Paul. I'll fix you something to eat.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
M	PAUL	Three more chapters to go.
F	ANNIE	The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
M	PAUL	Maybe.
F	ANNIE	This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
M	PAUL	Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
F	ANNIE	Oh you!
F	ANNIE	It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?-- --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place. Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
M	PAUL	I'm glad you like it.
F	ANNIE	Paul, this will be our legacy.
M	PAUL	It will.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
M	PAUL	You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
F	ANNIE	What things?
M	PAUL	You don't know?
F	ANNIE	I was fooling, silly. You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. Dome Pear-igg-non.
M	PAUL	Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
M	PAUL	Annie! Annie!
F	ANNIE	Yes, Paul.
M	PAUL	I'm almost done.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
M	PAUL	You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
F	ANNIE	Ahh!!!
F	ANNIE	Did I do good?
M	PAUL	You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Paul.
M	PAUL	It's all right here, Annie. Remember how for all those years no one ever knew who Misery's real father was, or if they'd ever be reunited? It's all right here. Will Misery finally lead her countrymen to freedom? Does she finally marry Ian or will it be Windthorne? It's all right here.
F	ANNIE	Paul, you can't.
M	PAUL	Why not? I learned it from you...
F	ANNIE	No, no, NOT MISERY--NOT MY MISERY...!
F	ANNIE	I'm going to kill you, you lying cocksucker...
M	PAUL	Here. Here. You want it? You want it? You can eat it--eat it--eat it till you fucking CHOKE--you sick, twisted fuck.
M	YOUNGER COP	It's the writer--the dead one--
M	PAUL	--right! I'm the dead one--
M	OLDER COP	Where's Sheriff McCain?
M	PAUL	He's in the cellar. She killed him.
M	OLDER COP	Annie Wilkes?
M	PAUL	Yeah. She's in there.
M	OLDER COP	Mr. Sheldon? There's no one in there.
M	PAUL	Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
F	SINDELL	Did they win?
M	PAUL	Yeah. They're in the semis.
F	SINDELL	Here it is. Very first copy.
F	SINDELL	The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
M	PAUL	That'd be a first.
F	SINDELL	And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
M	PAUL	Great.
F	SINDELL	I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
M	PAUL	I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
M	PAUL	I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper. Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
F	SINDELL	Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
M	PAUL	Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
F	SINDELL	Now you've hurt me, Paul.
F	SINDELL	I thought you were over it.
M	PAUL	I am. Well, maybe not completely--
M	PAUL	I don't know if you can ever be totally over something like that--I just don't think about it as much anymore, and when I do, it's not so terrifying.
M	PAUL	I mean, once they found her body, my nightmares stopped.
F	WAITRESS	Would you care for anything?
M	PAUL	Cut me something sinful...
