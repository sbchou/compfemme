M		Phil. What's happening?
M		Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?
M		they said I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from

M		me.
M		Is that your real name?
M		
M		are you related to the singer guy?
M		it's just a coincidence.
M		come no one in this country can pronounce my name right? It's Na-
M		least your name isn't Michael Bolton.
M		there's nothing wrong with that name.
M		was nothing wrong with it. Until I was about nine years old and
M		why don't just go by Mike, instead of Michael?

M		I am also not a pussy.
M		gonna find out the hard way that I'm not a pussy if they don't
M		right.
M		don't understand. I could come up with a program that could rip
M		
M		there she is.
M		you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with why don't you just ask her out?
M		I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me.
M		not?
M		I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne.
M		An occupational hypnotherapist?!
M		wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just
M		I know what you mean.
M		
M		is that supposed to mean?
M		Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you
M		I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I
M		she's anorexic.
M		I know. The guy's really good.

M		bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this
M		every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here.
M		going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought
M		Shit.
M		know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with really great idea like that and you never have to work again!
M		don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea.
M		guy made a million dollars! Y'know I had an idea like that once.
M		What was it, Tom?
M		all right. It was a Jump to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different
M		is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.
M		yes, it's horriblethis idea.
M		look. I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I have a job. high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you
M		what did you say?
M		never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.
M		you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would

M		don't know , man, I just get that feeling looking at her, like - I'm
M		ok. I just had a rough day.

M		Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday. I know it.
M		you can get out of that easily.
M		how?
M		when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of all you have to do is avoid him  all right, i got one  last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you
M		a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you
M		tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time.
M		it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two at the same time?
M		straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a
M		not all chicks.
M		the type that double up on a guy like me do.
M		point.
M		WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
M		two chicks at the same time?
M		yeah.
M		
M		huh?
M		would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing.
M		don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my
M		payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll,
M		you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points
M		that the guy?
M		
M		Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh,
M		I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told

M		that's great. I will talk to you later.
M		come on! (it finished saving, but starts to save another file) Oh,
M		Peter. What's happening? Um, I'm gonna need you go ahead and come
M		I'm sitting in my cubicle today and I realized that ever since I
M	SWANSON	about today? Is today the worse day of your life?
M		
M	SWANSON	that's bad stuff.
M		sorry.
M	SWANSON	
M		is there any way that you, you could just sock me out so there's no
M	SWANSON	really not what I do, Peter. However, the good news is, I think your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you
M		my God, Dr. Swanson! Ooh! Ooh! Is he dead? Oh!
M		hi. It's Bill Lundbergh. It's about ten o' clock, uh, wondering
M		MACHINE) YEAH, HI, IT'S BILL LUMBERGH AGAIN. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
M		hi, it's Bill Lum -
M		it's -
M		hi, it's Bill Lumbergh -
M		it's me again. Uh, I was away from my desk for a minute. Just
M

M		I didn't feel like it.
M		what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson
M		MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE
M		now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job
M		Peter? How come he didn't show up this weekend?
M		I don't know.
M		would really, really help us out.
M		WHO'S THAT GUY?
M		uh, any questions?
M		I'm Peter.
M		How can I help you?
M		are you doing for lunch today?
M		our specials are barbecued chicken - it's actually right over
M		Look who's back! Table for three, to -
M		was asking what you were doing for lunch. Would you like to have with me?
M		are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do
M		I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a
M		when you say "next door", do you mean Chili's or Flingers?
M		
M		
M	SLYDELL	what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and
M		that's right.
M	PORTER	then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the
M		uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with
M	SLYDELL	physically take the specs from the customer?
M		no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax.
M	SLYDELL	
M	PORTER	you must physically bring them to the software people.
M		Yeah, I mean, sometimes.
M	SLYDELL	what would you say you do here?
M		look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so
M	SLYDELL	see. You're Michael...Bolton?
M	PORTER	that your real name?
M		
M	PORTER	you in any relation to the pop singer?
M		just a coincidence.
M	SLYDELL	TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE HIS MUSIC. I DO . I AM A MICHAEL
M	PORTER	mean you must really love his music.
M		Yeahhe, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good, I guess.
M	SLYDELL	GOD DAMN right he is.
M	PORTER	tell me. What's your favorite song of his?
M		I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all.
M	SLYDELL	HA! I feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you, I mean,
M		you know, you can just call me Mike.
M		
M		
M		wonder if they will let me wear this in here.
M		think it would be ok. Would you like to sit down?
M		(does so) Wow. This place is really nice.
M		is it?
M		my God, compared to Chotchkie's. I like the uniforms better anyways.
M		like yours.
M		(makes a face
M		not in Kansas anymore."
M		Really. (laughs
M		on your - (points
M		That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair.
M		are pieces of flair?
M		where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff.
M		you get to pick them out yourself?
M		Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just
M		
M		where do you work, uh, Peter?
M		
M		uh, what do you do there, Peter?
M		sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.
M		WHAT'S THAT?
M		see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put
M		just not gonna go?
M		
M		you get fired?
M		don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go.
M		SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?
M		no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going.
M		did you decide all that?
M		a week ago.
M		
M		yeah.
M		So, so you're gonna get another job?
M		don't think I 'd like another job.
M		SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS?
M		I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that
M		SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
M		want to take you out for dinner and then I wanna go to my apartment
M		love Kung Fu...
M		39.
M		
M		should come over and watch Kung Fu tonight.
M		
M		
M		Can we order lunch first?
M		
M		
M		off my desk...
M		sounds great, Bob. I'll see you in a few. (they walk off)
M		
M		I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could
M		no, because I was, I was -
M		way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put
M		
M		(sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.
M		No.
M		me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get
M		I'll set the building on fire.
M		
M		
M		the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here
M		just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a
M		Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on What were you doing?
M		I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything
M		I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know, supposed to be having your interview right now with the
M		
M		has gotten into you?
M		yeah. Right.
M		Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make
M		no way. I feel great.
M	PORTER	next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons.
M	SLYDELL	All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter
M		Bob. Bob.
M	PORTER	don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?
M	SLYDELL	what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel
M		
M	SLYDELL	
M		I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side
M	PORTER	out?
M		I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that
M	SLYDELL	Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a
M		me tell you something about TPS reports...'
M		thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't
M	PORTER	don't care? a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and
M	SLYDELL	beg your pardon?
M		bosses.
M	SLYDELL	
M		bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different
M	SLYDELL	with me for a minute.
M		
M	SLYDELL	me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some
M		don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice
M	SLYDELL	It's all on this side of the table, trust me.
M		luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.
M	SLYDELL	
M		Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -
M		Would you come here for a moment, please?
M		sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.
M		need to talk about your flair.
M		I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him
M		ok, 15 is minimum, ok?
M		
M		it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare
M		Ok, you want me to wear more?
M		Joanna.
M		
M		can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's
M		So, more then?
M		we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare
M		Yeah.
M		Great. That's all I ask.
M		
M	SLYDELL	So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom
M		useless.
M	SLYDELL	
M		good to me.
M	SLYDELL	a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.
M		he?
M		know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.
M		
M	SLYDELL	can't find a record of him being a current employee here.
M	PORTER	looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed
M		
M		um, Milton has been let go.
M	SLYDELL	a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he
M	PORTER	always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is
M	SLYDELL	we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this
M		uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with
M	PORTER	handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.
M	SLYDELL	
M	PORTER	that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really
M	SLYDELL	it is.
M		I'm not sure about that now.
M	PORTER	right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you
M		
M		Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!
M		Peter.
M		Dom!
M		Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have
M		right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to
M		I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.
M		they called me at home.
M		sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all
M		
M		Milton. What's going on?
M		I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.
M		you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.
M		I did and they, and they said -
M		we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.
M		
M		we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can
M		I, I -
M		if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care
M		can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?
M	PORTER	looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.
M		wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.
M	SLYDELL	terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some
M		Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.
M	PORTER	these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...
M	SLYDELL	
M	PORTER	here anyway!
M	SLYDELL	Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.
M		gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?
M	PORTER	gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in
M	SLYDELL	it's standard operating procedure.
M		they know about this yet?
M	SLYDELL	No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we
M	PORTER	is a big promotion, Pete.
M	SLYDELL	
M		you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?
M	SLYDELL	
M		
M		Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-
M		Well, what are you doing tonight?
M		comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is
M		no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're
M		I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one
M		What about it?
M		how does it work?
M		pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in
M		sounds familiar.
M		They did this in Superman III.
M		What a good movie.
M		bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.
M		so they check for this now?
M		you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're
M		right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all
M		numbers up their asses.
M		Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?
M		not worth the risk. I got a good job.
M		if you didn't have a good job?
M		Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you,
M		I'm being promoted.
M		
M		I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something
M		told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.
M		is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass
M		course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work,
M		But Samir does.
M		that's not much money, I -
M		the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent.
M		like Superman III.
M		III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to
M		your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for
M		right! If I'm lucky.
M		I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed Aren't you?
M		Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.
M		Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't
M		
M		
M		I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.
M		what do you think?
M		thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.
M		came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock
M		have a question.
M		
M		in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?
M		You sure can.
M		I'm gonna do it.
M		what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!
M		Let's discuss the plan, all right?
M		right.
M		right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to
M		you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but
M		course.
M		
M		worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!
M		the fuck is that?!
M		don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see
M	SLYDELL	congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.
M	PORTER	we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away.
M		that was easy.
M		I guess it was.
M		did you do with the -
M		guys.
M		hey Drew.
M		you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?
M		guy who got laid off?
M		man, check this out.
M		
M		IS HE DEAD?!
M		BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND
M		I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE. IT'S JAMMED. I,
M	SMYKOWSKI	you ok, Tom?
M		
M		AND THEN, AS HE'S LOOKING AT HER, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO LIVE.
M		ok.
M	SMYKOWSKI	
M		seems to be working now. See ya later, honey. Love ya.
M		BUT THEN AS HE BACKS OUT INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, HE'S SLAMMED BIG TIME
M		is he ok?
M		of. He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his
M		our last day at Initech.
M		can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna
M		stole something.
M		yeah. I guess we all did.
M		I stole something else.
M		did you steal?
M		call it a going away present.
M		is going to be ok. Ok?
M		one I see is -
M		can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over.
M		BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...
M		what were you guys celebrating last night?
M		I'm not really at liberty to talk about it. I really can't.
M		when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these
M		you're stealing.
M		no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh,
M		So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?
M		
M		That's not yours?
M		it, it becomes ours.
M		that not stealing?
M		don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this
M		the crippled children?!
M		that's the tray. I'm talking about the tray. The penny's for
M		for everybody. Ok.
M		well, those are whole pennies.
M		
M		I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it
M		seems wrong.
M		not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all
M		but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the
M		know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear
M		
M		we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go
M		
M		Samir! How are you doing?
M		Tom.
M		Tom.
M		I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands)
M		Michael.
M		
M		-
M		
M		
M		How are ya? I'm glad you could make it.
M		Hi! This is someone I'd like you to meet. This is Joanna.
M		
M		Forgive me for not getting up. (He starts laughing and everyone
M		what do you think? It's a prototype.
M		that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about
M		thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I
M		
M		Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as
M		
M		remember
M		Tom.
M		sure.
M		visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is
M		no, we were just seeing -
M		Peter.
M		
M		something about old Tom Smykowski, huh?
M		
M		bastard. (sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at
M		
M		who's she here with?
M		here with me.

M		that, Drew?
M		you kidding me? She gets around, all right?
M		does, does she?
M		yeah. Like a record.
M		who?
M		let's see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let me see who else...
M		
M		what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is
M		YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP
M		What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh...
M		AH GOD! LUMBERGH!!
M		What is wrong with you? That was like to years ago! What, do you
M		I know him!! I know him! He's my boss!! He's my unholy,
M		he's not that disgusting.
M		represents all that is solace and wrong! And you slept with him!
