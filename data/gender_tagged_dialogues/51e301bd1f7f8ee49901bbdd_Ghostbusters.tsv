M	THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS	"Poultrygeist!"
M	by	and Steven Roberts
M	ONE	
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	
M	ZEKE	Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
F	MAUDE	Jes' set easy, Zeke. I'll take a look-see.
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	
F	MAUDE	Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
F	MAUDE	What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	
F	MAUDE	
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	TV WEREWOLF	
M	ZEKE	Everythin' okay out there, Maude?
M	MAUDE-CHICKEN	What say?
M	MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)	
M	ZEKE	Get away!' Scat! Shoo!
M	MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)	
M	ZEKE (VO)	Help!... He-elp!
M	PETER (VO)	Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute? It's Your night to take out the trash.
M	RAY	And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
M	EGON	Be with you in ... ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
M	PETER AND RAY	
M	SLIMER (VO)	
M	PETER	Thanks, Slimer. I really needed that!
M	SLIMER	Sorreee!
M	RAY	Egon! The phone!
M	EGON	In a minute, Ray.
M	WINSTON	Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself. Ghostbusters Central.
M	VOICE OVER PHONE	
M	WINSTON	Calm down... Where are you?... We'll be right there.
M	WINSTON	Ready for this one? Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
M	PETER	Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. Let's roll!
M	EGON	I think I've finally perfected it. Watch this, guys. Guys?
M	RAY	It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
M	PETER	Why? Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
M	WINSTON	But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his? He'll be a rich man!
M	PETER	Good. Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
M	MAUDE-CHICKEN	
M	MAUDE-CHICKEN	
M	ZEKE	Had big blood-red eyes, it did. Biggest dang chicken I ever seen. Mebbe six feet tall.
M	WINSTON	Shouldn't be hard to find.
M	RAY	Did it have any distinguishing marks?
M	PETER	Ray! It's six feet tall!
M	PETER (CONT)	Thank you, Sir. We'll put out a missing chicken report right away.
M	PETER	This one's easy, guys. Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn.
M	RAY	No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.
M	WINSTON	A werechicken?
M	PETER	Get serious, Ray.
M	RAY	Then explain those!
M	SLIMER	
M	SLIMER (VO)	Ow!
M	SLIMER	
M	RAY	What'd I tell you, Peter? A werechicken egg! Gimme a hand, Winston!
M	PETER	Look, if this is a werechicken egg,
M	PETER (CONT)	...how come there's no PKE reading?
M	RAY	I dunno... that is strange.
M	WINSTON	Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests. Then maybe we'll have some answers.
M	RAY	Oh no, I'm not leavin'. The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.
M	PETER	I'll take it. C'mon, Slimer.
M	PETER (CONT)	Werechickens.
M	PETER	Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you: How about analyzing this?
M	EGON	Interesting. That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
M	PETER	I don't wanna hear about it, Egon. We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.
M	WINSTON	Ray, it's gettin' pretty late. Maybe there really isn't any...
M	RAY	Shh!
M	RAY	It's in there.
M	WINSTON	Then let's get it!
M	WINSTON	Man, this place is creepy.
M	RAY	It's in here -- I can feel it.
M	WINSTON	Look out!
M	RAY & WINSTON	
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	
M	RAY	Something's close. Very close.
M	WERECHICKEN	It is a werechicken!
M	WINSTON	Man, he is ugly!
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	RAY	Bad choice of words, Winston.
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	SPIRIT	
M	RAY	Trap out!
M	WINSTON	Hang on! That's it!
M	RAY	We've almost got him!
M	CHICKEN	
M	RAY	Well, that takes care of one werechicken.
M	RAY (CONT)	Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife.
M	WINSTON	Ray, I just had a thought...
M	WINSTON (CONT)	What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's wife?
M	EGON	Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight. I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning.
M	EGON (CONT)	But it'll be safe in here.
M	SLIMER	Yeah.
M	SLIMER	G'night, Egon.
M	EGON	Goodnight, Slimer.
M	SLIMER	
M	SLIMER	Fooooood.
M	SLIMER	Yummy!
M	SLIMER	
M	SLIMER	
M	SLIMER	
M	BABY WERECHICKEN	
M	SLIMER	
M	PETER	
M	PETER	Slimer! How 'bout some privacy??
M	SLIMER	Monster! Inna kitchen!
M	PETER	Monster?
M	SLIMER	Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
M	EGON	Ow!
M	EGON (VO)	What?
M	PETER	Egon? Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster.
M	EGON-CHICKEN	
M	SLIMER	
M	PETER	Holy cow!!
M	EGON-CHICKEN	
M	TWO	
M	EGON-CHICKEN	
M	PETER	What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!
M	RAY (VO)	Peter! Wait!
M	PETER	Hey!
M	PETER	What's wrong with you guys? That thing ate Egon!
M	RAY	Peter, that is Egon! The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!
M	PETER	You're kidding! Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance.
M	WINSTON	What happened? He's so quiet all of a sudden.
M	RAY	It's the moon! Tonight's the first -- -- lunar eclipse in ten years!
M	PETER	Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?
M	RAY	Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.
M	RAY	Egon?
M	EGON	Ray, what is going on?
M	EGON (CONT)	And why am I naked?
M	SLIMER	Egon!
M	PETER	Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news.
M	EGON	Bad news first.
M	WINSTON	You've been turned into a werechicken!
M	EGON	A werechicken?
M	RAY	Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens! "The werechicken appears during the full moon. Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken." That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...
M	EGON	I remember the bite clearly. How long will I stay like this?
M	RAY	According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!
M	RAY	"One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin..."
M	EGON	I don't feel well.
M	PETER	Take it easy, Egon. You're gonna be fine. Hurry it up, guys!
M	RAY	"And one tablespoon of chickenbane."
M	SLIMER	No chickenbane!
M	RAY	Then we've gotta go with this! C'mon! Come on, Ray!! He's changing again!
M	RAY	Quick, Egon, drink this!
M	EGON	
M	WINSTON	We're too late!
M	PETER	What happened?
M	RAY	The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane.
M	PETER	Well, we hafta do something!
M	EGON	Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem.
M	BABY WERECHICKEN (VO)	
M	SLIMER	
M	WINSTON	What was that?
M	RAY	The werechicken that bit Egon. It's still out there somewhere.
M	PETER	Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else! Un, no offense, Egon.
M	PETER	All quiet on the chicken front. How about down there?
M	RAY	Not a peep.
M	WINSTON	No pun intended.
M	PEOPLE	
M	WINSTON	That's it!
M	BOX BOY	It's in there! A big chicken! It's gotta be ten feet tall!
M	WINSTON	Ten feet tall?
M	BOX BOY	Maybe fifteen, I dunno. Big! I'm outta here!
M	RAY	Let's split up.
M	WINSTON	How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
M	RAY	We didn't! Come on!
M	BUTCHER	A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall!
M	WINSTON	Thirty feet tall? Yeah! Look what it did to those cars!
M	PETER (VO)	It's how big? Okay, Ray, I admit you were right about these Werechickens,... ...but I definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings.
M	SLIMER	
M	SLIMER	
M	PETER	Ray, you were right! The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!
M	RAY	On our way, Peter.
M	JANINE (VO)	
F	JANINE	Egon! What happened?
M	EGON	It's a long story, Janine. Can you get my coat, please? I'm due at the weather board in forty-five... ...minutes.
F	JANINE	But what ...? Nevermind.
F	JANINE	Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this?
M	EGON	Trust me. I'm of sound mind at least.
M	EGON	
M	CROWD	
M	PETER	It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
M	RAY (VO)	Check! We're almost there.
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	
M	PETER	Take over, Slimer!
M	SLIMER	Roger!
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	RAY	Let's reel him in!
M	SPIRIT	
M	WINSTON	Trap's full! Somebody forgot to empty it!
M	RAY	Whose job was it?
M	RAY AND WINSTON	EGON'S!
M	RAY (VO)	It's gonna blow!
M	WINSTON (VO)	Peter, get outa here!
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	PETER	So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'
M	RAY	Peter, that's not a bed idea! Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!
M	WINSTON	Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?
M	RAY, WINSTON & PETER	Egon's weather balloon!
M	EGON	Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability -- ... of entering the upper atmosphere where clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.
M	BOARD	There, it can electronically alter weather cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun, rain, or... ...snow.
M	BOARD MEMBERS	
M	EGON	I, er, can explain this, but --
M	SLIMER	
M	EGON	What?
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	WEATHER BOARD MEMBERS	
M	PETER	Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons
M	EGON	Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.
M	PETER	Piece of cake.
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	WINSTON	What's it doing?
M	RAY	It looks like it's about to lay an --
M	WINSTON	I don't want to hear it.
M	EGON	Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left.
M	WERECHICKEN	
M	RAY AND WINSTON	They did it! All-right!!
M	MAUDE (VO)	Anyone for dessert?
M	EGON	You bet, Maude.
M	PETER	Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
M	EGON	I'm actually starting to like it.
F	MAUDE	No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon?
M	WINSTON	Uh-oh.
M	RAY	It came from the lab!
M	WERECHICKEN (VO)	
M	SLIMER	
M	WINSTON	It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
M	SLIMER	I feel good! I knew that I would So good, so good, so good!
M	PETER	Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?
