M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SETH	Is that them?
M	PETER	
M	SETH	Jesus Christ. Are they going to do it right there?
M	PETER	Yeah.
M	SETH	Fuck me.
M	WILL EMERSON	Have you guys ever seen this before?
M	SETH	No.
M	WILL EMERSON	Best to just ignore it. Keep your head down and get back to work... and don't watch. CONTINUED: 1
F	HEATHER	Timothy Singh?
M	TIMOTHY	Yes.
F	HEATHER	I'm afraid we have to speak with you.
M	HEATHER (cont'd)	Eric Dale?
M	PETER	Excuse me?
F	HEATHER	Eric Dale?
M	PETER	No.
F	HEATHER	Sorry?
M	PETER	I'm not Eric Dale.
F	HEATHER	Oh. I'm so sorry.
M	PETER	He's my boss, he's down that hall. A1
F	HEATHER	Mr. Dale?
M	ERIC	Yes.
F	HEATHER	This way. B1
M	LAUREN BRATBERG	Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that we are here today but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know.
M	ERIC	I run risk management... it just doesn't seem like a natural place to start cutting.
F	HEATHER	I hope you understand that this is in no way personal. A majority of this floor is being let go today. Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering. CONTINUED: 2
M	ERIC	OK
M	LAUREN BRATBERG	Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six months severance at half your salary. You will keep all unvested options that you currently hold. Health will be extended through that period. You have till tomorrow at... 4:47 to either take the offer or it will be revoked. Do you understand?
M	ERIC	Yes.
M	LAUREN BRATBERG	Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature. I hope considering your... ...over 19 years of service to the firm, you will understand that these measures are in no way a reflection of the firms' feelings towards your performance or your character.
M	ERIC	I'm sorry??
F	HEATHER	She's apologizing for what's about to happen.
M	LAUREN BRATBERG	Your company email, access to the server, access to the building, and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting. This gentleman... CONTINUED: (2) 2 will take you to your office so that you can clear out your personal belongings.
M	ERIC	What about my current ongoing work? I'm right in the...
M	LAUREN BRATBERG	The firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward, but we appreciate your concern.
F	HEATHER	We understand that this is very difficult and here is my card. Please contact me over the next few weeks if there is anything that I can do to help you through this transition in your life.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Sir?
M	WILL EMERSON	Hey.
M	ERIC	Will.
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm very sorry.
M	ERIC	Are you still alive?
M	WILL EMERSON	For now. CONTINUED: 3
M	ERIC	Congratulations.
M	WILL EMERSON	It's a total bloodbath.
M	ERIC	I heard.
M	WILL EMERSON	If there was anything I coulda done, you know I woulda done it.
M	ERIC	I know.
M	WILL EMERSON	Well...
M	ERIC	One more thing... Who was it?
M	WILL EMERSON	Eric...
M	ERIC	Was it Rogers?
M	WILL EMERSON	You know me. I'm not gonna say...
M	ERIC	Robertson?
M	ERIC (cont'd)	That cunt. I knew it. I never should have gone to her last year.
M	WILL EMERSON	Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad luck. Right....?
M	ERIC	Yeah.
M	WILL EMERSON	Good luck.
M	ERIC	Will?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah.
M	ERIC	You know I was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at.
M	WILL EMERSON	Eric, they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind. While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. Alright? Good luck.
M	PETER	Eric, I am very sorry.
M	SETH	Yeah. Did they say what was going to happen with us?
M	PETER	Jesus Seth.
M	SETH	What?
M	ERIC	No, it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine...
M	SETH	Well, take care, Eric.
M	ERIC	Well, I'll be seeing you around. CONTINUED: 4
M	PETER	I just wanted to say thank you.
M	ERIC	That's not necessary.
M	PETER	Well it is... You were the person around here that I...
M	ERIC	I know. I was close to something here... But they wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look. Be careful.
M	WILL EMERSON	Well, that was fucking hideous. CONTINUED: 6
M	SAM ROGERS	It's gonna get worse before it gets better.
M	WILL EMERSON	Really?
M	SAM ROGERS	Much.
M	WILL EMERSON	Got any nicorettes? I'm out of nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill someone in about 10 minutes... You alright?
M	SAM ROGERS	My dog is dying.
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm sorry?
M	SAM ROGERS	Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.
M	WILL EMERSON	Really?
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to do about it.
M	WILL EMERSON	Well they're all gone.
M	SAM ROGERS	How many do we have left?
M	WILL EMERSON	Thirty-three.
M	SAM ROGERS	Make sure everyone is out there, I need to say something.
M	WILL EMERSON	They are ready for you.
M	SAM ROGERS	You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work. CONTINUED: 9
M	ERIC	Robertson!
M	ERIC (cont'd)	Sarah Robertson! You shut off my phone???
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Eric... I didn't do anything.
M	ERIC	Fuck you.
M	SETH	You ok?
M	PETER	Yeah. Just a little freaked out.
M	SETH	You want to get a drink?
M	PETER	Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here.
M	SETH	Everyone is going out... come on. CONTINUED: 10
M	PETER	Nah, I'm fine.
M	SETH	Well, give me a call if you change your mind.
M	PETER	I will.
M	SETH	Come on.
M	PETER	Where are you going?
M	SETH	The Grand.
M	PETER	I'll call you when I'm done.
M	SETH	Be glad, you're still alive.
M	PETER	I am.
M	PETER	Come on, come on.
M	OPERATOR RECORDING	The number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service.
M	PETER	Fuck.
M	SETH	Hello.
M	PETER	I can't hear you.
M	SETH	What.
M	PETER	Go outside, I can't hear you.
M	SETH	Wait... Give me a sec... OK.
M	PETER	Where are you? CONTINUED: 17
M	SETH	Lugo.
M	PETER	Are you with Will?
M	SETH	Emerson?
M	PETER	Yes.
M	SETH	I think he's still here. Why?
M	PETER	You have to go get him, and get back up here.
M	SETH	Where?
M	PETER	The office.
M	SETH	What!
M	PETER	I'm serious.
M	SETH	You want me to get our boss's boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10:00 on a Thursday night?
M	PETER	Our boss just got axed, so technically he is our boss, and yes.
M	SETH	Why?
M	PETER	Just do it Seth.
M	SETH	Alright, we'll be there in ten.
M	FADE TO BLACK.	
M	WILL EMERSON	Hey, look who it is, burning the candle at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts planned though, so you can stop kissing my ass, honestly I don't even understand what you guys do.
M	PETER	Will, I am so sorry to call you back but I really think..
M	WILL EMERSON	Don't worry about it.
M	SETH	Hey. What's going on?
M	PETER	Look at this. Eric gave me this file before he left.
M	SETH	Eric?
M	PETER	Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'.
M	WILL EMERSON	Be careful?
M	PETER	So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good. CONTINUED: 18
M	SETH	What is he doing here?
M	PETER	Go to model four, and it makes more sense.
M	SETH	Oh.
M	WILL EMERSON	What is this?
M	PETER	This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model.
M	WILL EMERSON	What are those levels.
M	PETER	Well it's a fairly complicated...
M	WILL EMERSON	Simplify.
M	PETER	The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly.
M	WILL EMERSON	So what's happening?
M	SETH	We are starting to test those historic patterns.
M	WILL EMERSON	When? CONTINUED: (2) 18
M	PETER	Today.
M	SETH	Tuesday.
M	PETER	Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday.
M	SETH	Two Fridays ago.
M	WILL EMERSON	I get it.
M	SETH	Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...
M	PETER	Yeah...
M	SETH	It's huge.
M	WILL EMERSON	How huge?
M	SETH	The losses are greater than the current value of the company...?
M	PETER	Projected losses... projected...
M	SETH	Fuck me.
M	PETER	Yeah.
M	WILL EMERSON	Wait, and this is just our floor?
M	PETER	Yeah...
M	WILL EMERSON	Where the fuck is Eric Dale?
M	PETER	I can't find him, they cut off his phone.
M	WILL EMERSON	What?
M	PETER	They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.
M	WILL EMERSON	Fucking ruthless. And he's got no other cell?
M	PETER	No.
M	WILL EMERSON	How does he not have his own cellphone?
M	PETER	I tried, it's been turned off.
M	WILL EMERSON	I think I have his home number.
M	PETER	You're going to call his house?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yes... Do we even know if he's right?
M	PETER	It seems pretty fucking right to me.
M	SETH	It does.
M	WILL EMERSON	Hello, Mrs. Dale?... This is Will Emerson calling... I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if Eric was there?... Yes, we tried but his cell doesn't seem to be working... CONTINUED: 19 Ok, could you have him call me the moment he gets home, the moment he arrives? Thank you very much. Where the fuck is he?
M	SETH	Doesn't he have like three kids?
M	WILL EMERSON	So?
M	SETH	I'm just saying, would you go home?
M	WILL EMERSON	I know where he is. You two need to go get him.
M	PETER	Now?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yes. There will be a car waiting for you downstairs. Get him back here.
M	PETER	What are you going to do?
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm calling Sam.
M	PETER	Fuck me.
M	WILL EMERSON	Go.
M	FADE IN:	
M	SAM ROGERS	It's 11:00 at night?
M	WILL EMERSON	I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called...
M	SAM ROGERS	What's the problem?
M	WILL EMERSON	I think you need to get down here.
M	SAM ROGERS	What?
M	WILL EMERSON	Sam...
M	SAM ROGERS	It's 11:00 o'clock.
M	WILL EMERSON	I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam. But you need to see this.
M	SAM ROGERS	See what?
M	WILL EMERSON	Well...
M	SAM ROGERS	Email it to me.
M	WILL EMERSON	I don't think that is a good idea.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm on my way.
M	SETH	You want one?
M	PETER	No.
M	SETH	What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about... ... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something.
M	PETER	I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point.
M	SETH	I guess that's true.
M	PETER	Look at these people.
M	SETH	What?
M	PETER	We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming. Right?
M	SETH	I try not to let work get to me. CONTINUED: 22
M	PETER	I've noticed that about you actually.
M	SETH	Look, we are twenty three years old...
M	PETER	Twenty-Seven.
M	SETH	Whatever, same thing, I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven. And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins.
M	PETER	You do know it's a little more complicated than that?
M	SETH	It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him? What do I tell him.
M	PETER	Tell him that we haven't found him.
M	SAM ROGERS	Hey. CONTINUED: 24
M	WILL EMERSON	Hey.
M	SAM ROGERS	So?
M	WILL EMERSON	Eric Dale...
M	SAM ROGERS	Oh Jesus...
M	WILL EMERSON	Before he was escorted out of the building by security...
M	SAM ROGERS	I had nothing to do with that.
M	WILL EMERSON	I know.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm sorry, go on.
M	WILL EMERSON	So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...
M	SAM ROGERS	Who's Peter Sullivan again?
M	WILL EMERSON	One of Eric's guys.
M	SAM ROGERS	Right.
M	WILL EMERSON	...and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. So he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'...
M	SAM ROGERS	Be careful? CONTINUED: (2) 24
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah.
M	SAM ROGERS	Be careful?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yes.
M	SAM ROGERS	Why?
M	WILL EMERSON	Well... take a look.
M	SAM ROGERS	Speak, you know I can't read those fucking things they put together.
M	WILL EMERSON	Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it.
M	SAM ROGERS	Nailed it?
M	WILL EMERSON	The kid figured out what Eric was missing. And...
M	SAM ROGERS	And?
M	WILL EMERSON	...it isn't good. As far as I can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits... which I guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily... and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry.
M	SAM ROGERS	How ugly?
M	WILL EMERSON	Real ugly.
M	SAM ROGERS	And how close to those limits have we gotten?
M	WILL EMERSON	Oh we're beyond close... We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now...
M	SAM ROGERS	For now?
M	WILL EMERSON	Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it.
M	SAM ROGERS	What am I looking at?
M	WILL EMERSON	And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us... historically speaking.
M	SAM ROGERS	Is this right?
M	WILL EMERSON	I don't know.
M	SAM ROGERS	Where is Eric?
M	WILL EMERSON	We shut his phone off.
M	SAM ROGERS	Of course we did.
M	WILL EMERSON	And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to his wife.
M	SAM ROGERS	He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere. CONTINUED: (4) 24
M	WILL EMERSON	Or worse.
M	SAM ROGERS	Where's the kid who did this?
M	WILL EMERSON	Out looking for Eric.
M	SAM ROGERS	Do we think he knows what he's doing?
M	WILL EMERSON	I don't know. What do I know?
M	SAM ROGERS	Well get him back here.
M	PETER	What now?
M	SETH	We should probably tell Will he's not here.
M	PETER	Yeah.
M	SETH	What do you think this girl makes in a night?
M	PETER	Seth.
M	SETH	2000? Fuck. That's.... All things considered, that's not bad. Will?... No, no, we asked and no one's seen him.
M	SETH	He's freaking out. We need to get down there. What'a you think Rogers makes in a year?
M	PETER	I have no idea?
M	SETH	Come on, play along.
M	PETER	I don't know what year?
M	SETH	Last year.
M	PETER	Three quarters of a million bucks?
M	SETH	Come on.
M	PETER	What? CONTINUED: 27
M	SETH	Not even close.
M	PETER	More?
M	SETH	Yes.
M	PETER	A million?
M	SETH	Will Emerson made two and half million bucks last year.
M	PETER	Fuck you.
M	PETER (cont'd)	Fuck you!
M	SETH	He did.
M	PETER	How do you know that?
M	SETH	He told me.
M	PETER	He just told you that?
M	SETH	Well I asked him.
M	PETER	Do you think that's true.
M	SETH	Probably.
M	PETER	That's fucked up.
M	SETH	Why?
M	PETER	Does that seem right to you? CONTINUED: (2) 27
M	SETH	Right?
M	PETER	Jesus.
M	SETH	So what do you think that means Rogers puts away?
M	PETER	I have no idea. This fucking traffic. We should have taken a the subway.
M	WILL EMERSON	Gentlemen?
M	SAM ROGERS	You're coming with us.
M	SETH	Will. Mr. Rogers.
M	WILL EMERSON	Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.
M	SETH	Sir.
M	SAM ROGERS	Guys. CONTINUED: 29
M	PETER	Will?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yes?
M	PETER	Where are we going?
M	SAM ROGERS	Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter.
M	ALL PRESENT	Slight hellos, etc.
M	JARED COHEN	So Sam, what do you have for us? CONTINUED: 31
M	SAM ROGERS	Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.
M	JARED COHEN	Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then.
M	SAM ROGERS	OK.
M	JARED COHEN	This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our chief risk management officer, Ramesh Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of the firm's in house counsel.
M	SAM ROGERS	Nice to meet you all. This is Will Emerson my head of trading, and this is...
M	WILL EMERSON	Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They work in our risk department.
M	JARED COHEN	Where is Eric Dale?
M	SAM ROGERS	He was let go today.
M	JARED COHEN	So who's left in your risk department?
M	WILL EMERSON	As of today that would be Peter and our junior analyst Seth...?
M	JARED COHEN	Really?
M	COPY ROOM GUY	Will Emerson? CONTINUED: (2) 31
M	WILL EMERSON	Here. Please just give one to everyone, thanks.
M	SAM ROGERS	So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought. Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out.
M	JARED COHEN	Where is Eric Dale now?
M	SAM ROGERS	He's been unreachable since he left the office.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Peter this is your work?
M	PETER	Mainly Mr. Dale's...
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	But this draft is yours?
M	PETER	Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's original model. But yes.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	And what is your background?
M	PETER	Background?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Your CV.
M	PETER	I have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time... But I hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.
M	JARED COHEN	What's a specialty in propulsion?
M	PETER	Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.
M	JARED COHEN	So you are a rocket scientist?
M	PETER	Um... I was... yes.
M	JARED COHEN	How did you end up here?
M	PETER	Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here.
M	JARED COHEN	What time is it?
M	RAMESH	It's 2:15.
M	JARED COHEN	What do you have in exposure right now, tonight?
M	SAM ROGERS	I don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly. CONTINUED: (4) 31
M	RAMESH	If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct...
M	PETER	1.215 Trillion.
M	RAMESH	Yes.
M	JARED COHEN	Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Look we'd need a little more time to go over this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know what he's doing. And I don't have to tell you that this is a problem.
M	JARED COHEN	Thank you for that. What time is it?
M	RAMESH	
M	JARED COHEN	Fuck me! Sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books?
M	SAM ROGERS	What?
M	JARED COHEN	The 1.2 trillion.
M	SAM ROGERS	All of it?
M	JARED COHEN	Yes.
M	SAM ROGERS	I don't know, a couple weeks?
M	JARED COHEN	Weeks?
M	SAM ROGERS	Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick.
M	JARED COHEN	I understand.
M	SAM ROGERS	Do you?
M	JARED COHEN	How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's?
M	SAM ROGERS	I don't know, sixty.
M	RAMESH	Jared I've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off.
M	JARED COHEN	Excuse me, I need to make a quick call. Please...
M	RAMESH	I was just saying, and just speaking completely off the record here, it won't be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here. If they haven't already.
M	JARED COHEN	Understood... And Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books, if they had to be?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Why would they still be on the books?
M	SAM ROGERS	Because suddenly no one wants to buy them.
M	JARED COHEN	Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking break, all at once?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Without an active market, it could take weeks, months for me to value them correctly. You'd have to go block by block.
M	SAM ROGERS	It's a very simple business Jared. You and I talked about this last year...
M	JARED COHEN	Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??
M	SETH	Seth.
M	JARED COHEN	Seth, Could you please excuse us for a few minutes. Oh and Peter? Who else has seen this? CONTINUED: (7) 31
M	PETER	No one... besides us here.
M	JARED COHEN	And Mr. Dale.
M	PETER	Yes.
M	JARED COHEN	And can it really be that we don't know where Eric Dale is?
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut off his phone today.
M	JARED COHEN	Perfect. Well, I need to know where he is.
M	SETH	Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?
M	WILL EMERSON	He's Sam's boss.
M	SETH	He looks like he's fifteen years old. How old is he?
M	WILL EMERSON	He's like forty.
M	PETER	How does that happen?
M	WILL EMERSON	Oh it happens all the time. Except to me. Kid's a fucking killer.
M	PETER	What are they talking about? CONTINUED: 32
M	WILL EMERSON	It ain't pretty.
M	SETH	What ain't pretty?
M	WILL EMERSON	If people suddenly stop buying the shit we're selling.... You guys smoke? Well, you should.
M	SAM ROGERS	Jared you can't do what you are thinking about doing.
M	JARED COHEN	What if we don't have a choice?
M	SAM ROGERS	What does that mean? Fuck you... you don't have a choice.
M	JARED COHEN	Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers Sam??
M	SAM ROGERS	Yes, but what the hell do I know.
M	JARED COHEN	Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but to me these numbers don't add up.
M	RAMESH	If I may I'd like to take some time before we...
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Jared we can't answer that yet.
M	JARED COHEN	Are you fucking kidding me... this is exactly what we've... CONTINUED: 33
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	We need a little time before we can give you our conclusion.
M	JARED COHEN	OK. We meet in 45 minutes.
M	RAMESH	Sam, do you have this file?
M	SAM ROGERS	Yes, here it is.
M	JARED COHEN	And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand.
M	SAM ROGERS	What are you going to do?
M	JARED COHEN	Not sure.
M	SAM ROGERS	Are you going to call him?
M	JARED COHEN	I already did.
M	SETH	Jesus. CONTINUED: 36
M	PETER	Wow.
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah.
M	SETH	Shit, that's a long way down.
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah, it is.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Is this really where you want to be taking this at this point?
M	JARED COHEN	I'm sorry?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	We don't even know if he's right.
M	JARED COHEN	How long should this take you to confirm?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Not long.
M	JARED COHEN	OK CONTINUED: 39
M	PETER	Careful.
M	SETH	Jesus man.
M	WILL EMERSON	Did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump? ....It's a fear of losing faith.
M	SETH	Well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you.
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah well, I can get a little dark sometimes.
M	SETH	Will, come on. Get down.
M	WILL EMERSON	Not today! So it looks like they are gonna have us dump this shit.
M	SETH	What?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah, you watch.
M	SETH	How?
M	PETER	A trillion bucks??
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm just saying.
M	PETER	How would they even do that? CONTINUED: (2) 39
M	WILL EMERSON	You can't... it's impossible. But they'll figure out a way. I've been at this place for ten years and I've seen some things that you wouldn't believe... and when all is said and done... they don't lose money. They don't care if everyone else does, but they won't.
M	SETH	Will?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah?
M	SETH	Did you really make two and half million bucks last year?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah... I did.
M	PETER	What do you do with all that money?
M	WILL EMERSON	I don't know really. It goes pretty quick. You learn to spend what's in your pocket.
M	SETH	Two and a half million goes quickly?
M	WILL EMERSON	Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what??
M	PETER	Eight hundred.
M	WILL EMERSON	I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...
M	SETH	CONTINUED: (3) 39
M	WILL EMERSON	And what's that?
M	PETER	125 left.
M	WILL EMERSON	I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores.
M	PETER	
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment.
M	PETER SETH	Whoa! Whoa! What time is it?
M	SETH	
M	WILL EMERSON	Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there.
M	SAM ROGERS	How old are you?
M	JARED COHEN	CONTINUED: 40
M	SAM ROGERS	Jesus...
M	JARED COHEN	This is a very... very bad dream.
M	SAM ROGERS	I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Hello.
M	JARED COHEN	Come in.
M	SAM ROGERS	How do we look? I should go.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	No, you should stay.
M	JARED COHEN	So?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless.
M	JARED COHEN	What do you mean?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It's broken.
M	JARED COHEN	There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation?? CONTINUED: (2) 40
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	We were wrong.
M	JARED COHEN	You mean you were wrong.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Don't even start.... This was discussed.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm heading to the conference room.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	No.
M	JARED COHEN	I'd like you to hear this.
M	SAM ROGERS	No... I don't want to hear this. How do you think I've stuck around this place so long.
M	JARED COHEN	I've called Tuld.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Is there a contingency plan here?
M	JARED COHEN	A contingency plan?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Yes.
M	JARED COHEN	We went all in on this one.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	So we've got ourselves quite exposed here... haven't we?
M	JARED COHEN	To Tuld or the market?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Both. CONTINUED: (3) 40 He's here.
M	WILL EMERSON	We were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed.
M	JARED COHEN	I know. Come with us. Where's Sam.
M	WILL EMERSON	I don't know. Do you want all of us>
M	JARED COHEN	Yes.
M	JARED COHEN	Just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there... this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do... just... tell the truth... don't try to change a word of it, no sugar coating... no one here is smart enough... including the rocket scientist. CONTINUOUS
M	ASSISTANT	Mr. Cohen?
M	JARED COHEN	Yes.
M	ASSISTANT	This way. They are already in there waiting for you.
M	JARED COHEN	OK.
M	JOHN TULD	Please sit down. Welcome everyone. I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what I've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago... CONTINUED: 45 but that is spilt milk under the bridge. So why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here?
M	JARED COHEN	Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout...
M	JOHN TULD	Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English? ... Actually I'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? Does he speak English?
M	JARED COHEN	Sir?
M	JOHN TULD	I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess.
M	JARED COHEN	Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.
M	PETER	Sir.
M	JOHN TULD	Ah, there he is.
M	PETER	Yes sir.
M	JOHN TULD	How old are you Mr. Sullivan?
M	PETER	I'm twenty-seven sir.
M	JOHN TULD	Please call me John.
M	PETER	Yes sir. CONTINUED: (2) 45
M	JOHN TULD	So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that.
M	PETER	Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS
M	JOHN TULD	Now you lost me at M...
M	PETER	Sorry...
M	JOHN TULD	I was joking Mr. Sullivan.
M	PETER	Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.
M	JOHN TULD	I have.
M	PETER	Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.
M	JOHN TULD	And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?
M	PETER	We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to. CONTINUED: (3) 45
M	JOHN TULD	Yes.
M	PETER	But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.
M	JOHN TULD	And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan?
M	PETER	We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.
M	JOHN TULD	Give or take.
M	PETER	Give or take.
M	JOHN TULD	Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?
M	PETER	Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.
M	JOHN TULD	So what you're saying is it's already happened?
M	PETER	Sort of.
M	JOHN TULD	And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here? CONTINUED: (4) 45
M	PETER	Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But...
M	JOHN TULD	You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.
M	PETER	Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.
M	JOHN TULD	So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism? Mr. Sullivan?
M	PETER	Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.
M	JOHN TULD	Well let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why I get the big bucks, so to speak?
M	PETER	Yes.
M	JOHN TULD	I'm here for one reason and one reason only. I'm here to guess what the music is gonna do a week, month, a year from now. That's it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid... standing here tonight... that I don't hear... a... thing... just silence.
M	JOHN TULD (cont'd)	So, now that we know that the music has stopped, what can we do about it?
M	JOHN TULD (cont'd)	Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr. Sullivan today.
M	JOHN TULD (cont'd)	What have you got for us? What have I told you since the first day you walked into my office? (pause) That there are three ways to make a living in this business... Be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even though I like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first.
M	JARED COHEN	Sell it all today...
M	JOHN TULD	Is that even possible Sam? CONTINUED: (6) 45
M	SAM ROGERS	It is, but at what cost?
M	JOHN TULD	I'll pay.
M	SAM ROGERS	Really?
M	JOHN TULD	I think so.
M	SAM ROGERS	Almost a trillion bucks of paper?
M	JOHN TULD	Where does it come back to us?
M	SAM ROGERS	Everywhere.
M	JOHN TULD	Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if I made you... how would you do it?
M	SAM ROGERS	You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down.
M	JOHN TULD	Ramesh? CONTINUED: (7) 45
M	RAMESH	They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you.
M	SAM ROGERS	John... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to?
M	JOHN TULD	The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it.
M	SAM ROGERS	If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over.
M	JOHN TULD	
M	SAM ROGERS	And you are selling something you know has no value.
M	JOHN TULD	We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that WE may survive, Sam.
M	SAM ROGERS	You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again.
M	JOHN TULD	I understand.
M	SAM ROGERS	Do you?
M	JOHN TULD	Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it! It's 4:00... Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan. Is there anyone else who actually knows what's in there right now, block by block?
M	PETER	Eric Dale.
M	JOHN TULD	Where is Eric Dale?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	As of today he is no longer with the firm.
M	JARED COHEN	We have been trying to locate him.
M	JOHN TULD	So he is just out there with this information?
M	JARED COHEN	
M	JOHN TULD	Carmelo?
M	LOUIS CARMELO	Yes.
M	JOHN TULD	Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30.
M	LOUIS CARMELO	Done.
M	JOHN TULD	OK, meet back here in an hour. Sam... let's talk. CONTINUED: A45
M	JOHN TULD	Hell of a town isn't it?
M	SAM ROGERS	Never really did it for me actually.
M	JOHN TULD	Really?
M	SAM ROGERS	Always been kinda a grass and tree guy.
M	JOHN TULD	I've always loved this place. Ever since I arrived. Everything about it.
M	SAM ROGERS	I can't say I feel that about anyplace actually.
M	JOHN TULD	Are you going to be able to come on board here Sam?
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm not sure John. This is really ugly.
M	JOHN TULD	You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell. That's what we do. It's not complicated.
M	SAM ROGERS	Exactly. And you damn well know that you don't make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more, and tomorrow we are done.
M	JOHN TULD	This is it Sam.
M	SAM ROGERS	You keep saying that, what is that supposed to mean?
M	JOHN TULD	It's the big one. Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one.
M	SAM ROGERS	Us?
M	JOHN TULD	The street.
M	SAM ROGERS	What are you talking about?
M	JOHN TULD	This won't be the last `situation' I will be having this week. It's just the start.
M	SAM ROGERS	It's only the start because we are starting it.
M	JOHN TULD	Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not this time. The numbers just don't add up anymore.
M	SAM ROGERS	Well I agree with you there, I've been saying that for years.
M	JOHN TULD	I mean if this kid can come up with this...?
M	SAM ROGERS	I don't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys like this.
M	JOHN TULD	Oh please, when did you become so soft.
M	SAM ROGERS	Fuck you soft, you're panicking.
M	JOHN TULD	If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking
M	SAM ROGERS	Look, I obviously don't have all the information that you do. But I think this could destroy this firm. You'll never be trusted again. You are knowingly putting people out of business. Full stop.
M	JOHN TULD	You let me take care of that.
M	WILL EMERSON	How'd that go?
M	SAM ROGERS	This is a fucking shit show.
M	WILL EMERSON	They are going to do it?
M	SAM ROGERS	Probably.
M	WILL EMERSON	Jesus.
M	SAM ROGERS	Remember this day boys, remember this day.
M	ASSISTANT	Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry.
M	WILL EMERSON	Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast. And let's face it, it's you.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	So what's the strategy here?
M	JARED COHEN	That's where I'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	No, you and I... with Tuld.
M	JARED COHEN	I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I've ever done this.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Please.
M	JARED COHEN	He knows where we both have stood on this all along. There's nothing more to do.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him, I don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort.
M	JARED COHEN	I'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don't think there is one to be found.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	So again, what's the strategy here?
M	JARED COHEN	On this particular front, I'm just not sure there's much left to do. CONTINUED: 49
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It's very simple. Don't even think of fucking me on this one, because if we are going down... you damn well know its going to be together.
M	JARED COHEN	No, I'm not sure I do know that.
M	SETH	What do you think Tuld made last year?
M	PETER	Would you shut the fuck up.
M	WILL EMERSON	86 mil. in salary and bonus.
M	PETER	Really?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah, it's public record.
M	SETH	That's a lot of fucking money.
M	WILL EMERSON	He was worth a billion.
M	PETER	Was?
M	WILL EMERSON	Before today.
M	SETH	Really?
M	WILL EMERSON	You'll see. CONTINUED: 50
M	PETER	....I think I'm going to go get a coffee, does anyone need anything.
M	WILL EMERSON	
M	PETER	I need a little real air.
M	SETH	Probably a good idea.
M	PETER	Will, is that alright?
M	WILL EMERSON	Alright?
M	PETER	If I get out of here for a minute?
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah. Are you kidding? It's not a prison. Do you want me to hold your hand? Will Emerson...Yes...Oh thank you...I understand...OK.
M	SAM ROGERS	What?
M	WILL EMERSON	That was Eric's wife. He's alive, he's home. He doesn't want to talk to us. And he doesn't know she called me.
M	SAM ROGERS	Where's he live?
M	WILL EMERSON	The heights.
M	WILL EMERSON (cont'd)	Should we call Tuld's guy?
M	SAM ROGERS	No... it's Eric... the last thing we need is those guys going over there, you two go try to get him. But you've got to be back here by 6:00.
M	WILL EMERSON	OK.
M	JOHN TULD	May I come in?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Please, sit.
M	JOHN TULD	So... we are going to do this thing.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	OK.
M	JOHN TULD	It's going to be tight.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Is Sam on board?
M	JOHN TULD	Not yet. Sarah, I need a head to feed to these traders... and the board... this morning. CONTINUED: 51
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Is it me or Cohen?
M	JOHN TULD	It's you.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this?
M	JOHN TULD	I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here...
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	
M	JOHN TULD	Obviously it's quite complicated.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	John I was told that in no uncertain terms...
M	JOHN TULD	It was all a very grey area.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen.
M	JOHN TULD	I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this...
M	JOHN TULD (cont'd)	We all fucked this one up pretty good...
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Yes. We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	I understand. CONTINUED: (2) 51
M	JOHN TULD	They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs... Good luck.
M	SETH	Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this way.
M	WILL	What does wonderboy want?
M	JARED COHEN	Do you have a minute?
M	WILL	We're heading to get Eric Dale.
M	JARED COHEN	I know. I just need a second.
M	WILL	What is it?
M	JARED COHEN	Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here.
M	WILL	I don't think that's ever been a problem.
M	JARED COHEN	Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations. CONTINUED: 52
M	WILL	Sam will step up.
M	JARED COHEN	I know he will...but if he doesn't... But if he doesn't, we need to know that you will.
M	WILL	That I will what?
M	JARED COHEN	Step up.
M	WILL	I have no doubt Sam will make the right choice. And if it makes you feel any better he and I have always had the same interpretation of what's right...no matter how acute the situation. CONTINUED: 54
M	JOHN TULD	There he is.
M	SAM ROGERS	John. So what's it look like John?
M	JOHN TULD	Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.
M	SAM ROGERS	What does that mean?
M	JOHN TULD	It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle. Here.
M	SAM ROGERS	That's very generous. CONTINUED: 55
M	JOHN TULD	It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm with the firm John.
M	JOHN TULD	I won't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you... unless they believe in you completely. Are you in?
M	SAM ROGERS	I told you I have my reservations.
M	JOHN TULD	Well you can't have any reservations. And I need to know now.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm with the firm completely John, as I always have been. Excuse me. CONTINUED: 57
M	COFFEE GUY	One fifty.
M	PETER	Thank you.
F	LUCY	Hey...
M	PETER	Hi. It's really good to see you.
F	LUCY	You too. You look tired.
M	PETER	I am.
F	LUCY	What are you doing here?
M	PETER	I never left work. Just had to get out for a walk.
F	LUCY	You're still working there?
M	PETER	Yes, of course...
F	LUCY	Oh. I thought...
M	PETER	How are you? Are you happy? You look happy.
F	LUCY	I am. CONTINUED: (2) 57
M	PETER	Well, I should get back... How's your father?
F	LUCY	He's good. Thanks for asking.
M	PETER	OK. Be safe.
F	LUCY	Hey... You got any inside tips for him?
M	PETER	Sell.
M	SETH	Jesus, nice place. CONTINUED: 59
M	WILL EMERSON	He just bought it.
M	SETH	I hope it was with cash.
M	WILL EMERSON	You are such a prick, and it wasn't.
M	SETH	I think I should stay here.
M	WILL EMERSON	Get out of the fucking car. I just don't think it would be appropriate.
M	WILL EMERSON	Appropriate? Get the fuck out of the car.
M	SETH	Really?
M	WILL EMERSON	You're probably right... And don't touch any of the fucking buttons.
M	ERIC	What are you doing here?
M	WILL EMERSON	Peter finished that model you were working on.
M	ERIC	Really?
M	WILL EMERSON	It's created a bit of a shit storm.
M	ERIC	Yeah, I bet.
M	WILL EMERSON	Do you want to see it... the model? CONTINUED: 60
M	ERIC	No.
M	WILL EMERSON	Really?
M	ERIC	No. But I'm pretty sure what it says.
M	WILL EMERSON	Do you think he's right?
M	ERIC	I'm sure he's right.
M	WILL EMERSON	Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight. John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position. Today.
M	ERIC	Well, I am very sorry to hear that.
M	WILL EMERSON	They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here.
M	ERIC	Please.
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm just saying.
M	ERIC	Not a chance.
M	WILL EMERSON	This is serious shit Eric. CONTINUED: (2) 60
M	ERIC	You don't think I know that. I've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March.
M	WILL EMERSON	Well...
M	ERIC	Fuck her... Fuck her.
M	WILL EMERSON	Look...
M	ERIC	I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've got nothing on me anymore.
M	WILL EMERSON	They'll pay...
M	ERIC	I've already been paid enough by them.
M	ERIC (cont'd)	Did you know I built a bridge once?
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm sorry?
M	ERIC	A bridge.
M	WILL EMERSON	No, I didn't.
M	ERIC	I was an engineer by trade.
M	WILL EMERSON	Well...
M	ERIC	It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river. Steel through arch design. 12,100 people a day use the thing. It cut out 35 miles each way of extra driving to get from Wheeling to New Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000 miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000 miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a year saved. I completed that project in 1986... 22 years ago. Over the life of that one bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million... 240 thousand miles that haven't had to be driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020 days... so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 1531 years of their lives not wasted in the car... give or take.
M	WILL EMERSON	Jesus.
M	ERIC	One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one years...
M	WILL EMERSON	Fuck...
M	ERIC	That's what I did. Look... you better get back over there.
M	WILL EMERSON	Yeah.
M	ERIC	Crazy shit.
M	WILL EMERSON	True. Dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day. Fucked up. Well... alright.
M	ERIC	Thanks for stopping by. CONTINUED: (4) 60
M	WILL EMERSON	No problem.
M	ERIC	Who the fuck is this?
M	WILL EMERSON	I'd guess it's the firm's people.
M	ERIC	What?
M	WILL EMERSON	Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.
M	ERIC	They fired me Will. Fuck em... Fuck em.
M	WILL EMERSON	Just come back with them, take the bonus, and you're home tonight by five. Either that or they are going to fight you on everything, the package, the options... You're a better man than I.
M	ERIC	Well that's always been true.
M	WILL EMERSON	Yes it has.
M	ERIC	See ya.
M	WILL EMERSON	The house looks great by the way.
M	ERIC	Thanks. CONTINUED: (5) 60
M	WILL EMERSON	And Eric...don't beat yourself up too bad over this shit.
M	ERIC	Yeah.
M	WILL EMERSON	Who the fuck knows. Some people like driving the long way home.
M	SETH	So, am I getting fired?
M	WILL EMERSON	I don't know. Probably...yes...almost definitely.
M	SETH	Are you?
M	WILL EMERSON	No.
M	SETH	Oh.
M	WILL EMERSON	It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better. CONTINUED: 61
M	SETH	I get it. When did you know this is what you wanted to do?
M	WILL EMERSON	The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day.
M	SETH	Fuck me.
M	WILL EMERSON	It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming from three days away. I took my time. I was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it was beautiful.
M	SETH	How did you learn to do that?
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow.
M	WILL EMERSON (CONT'D) (cont'd)	Look man I'm sorry about this.
M	SETH	Don't be, you're not doing it to me.
M	WILL EMERSON	I know...but I'm still sorry. At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with.
M	SETH	Only if we can get this done, right?
M	WILL EMERSON	We'll get it done.
M	SETH	How? CONTINUED: (2) 61
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm trying to figure that out right now.
M	SETH	There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now.
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I'll make them willing.
M	SETH	Are you ok with that?
M	WILL EMERSON	I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is.
M	SETH	I guess. And what about everyone else?
M	WILL EMERSON	Everyone else?
M	SETH	Normal people.
M	WILL EMERSON	What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth. Look, If you want to do this with your life, and do it well, you need to believe that you are necessary. And you are. If people want to live like this...with their big cars and these houses that they haven't even paid for. Then you are necessary. The only reason they can continue to live like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scale in THEIR favor. And if I were to take my finger off... Then the whole world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly. And no one wants that, they say they do...but they don't. They want what we're giving them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea how we get it. And that's more hypocrisy than I can swallow. So fuck em. And tomorrow if this all goes south they'll crucify us for being reckless, but if we are wrong and everything get's back on track. They'll be laughing their arses off at us for being the biggest bunch of pussies that God ever let through the door.
M	SETH	Are we gonna be wrong on this one?
M	WILL	No...they're all gonna get fucked.
M	PETER	Hello.
M	SAM ROGERS	Peter. You want one? CONTINUED: 62
M	PETER	I don't smoke.
M	SAM ROGERS	That's good. I don't much either.
M	PETER	It's kinda beautiful out right now.
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah, I guess it is... I've never really liked this town much.
M	PETER	How long have you been here?
M	SAM ROGERS	Forty years.
M	PETER	I think it's beautiful. The whole place. Forty years, that's something... Are you tired?
M	SAM ROGERS	Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard as you do.
M	PETER	That's not true.
M	SAM ROGERS	No it is, actually.
M	PETER	Are we all getting fired after today?
M	SAM ROGERS	Probably.
M	PETER	They're going to fire you? CONTINUED: (2) 62
M	SAM ROGERS	That's not what they'll call it,... it'll be a mercy killing really. You don't have to stand out here for me.
M	PETER	I don't really want to go back in there just yet.
M	SAM ROGERS	I understand that.
M	PETER	I think I know your son.
M	SAM ROGERS	Really?
M	PETER	Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person.
M	SAM ROGERS	He is a nice person. I guess you could say alot worse about a guy.
M	PETER	Have you told him what's about to happen?
M	SAM ROGERS	What do you mean?
M	PETER	This whole thing.
M	SAM ROGERS	No... I hadn't even thought of it.
M	PETER	I guess it's illegal anyway? CONTINUED: (3) 62
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught.
M	PETER	He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help.
M	SAM ROGERS	That's very true.
M	PETER	He works with a friend of mine.
M	SAM ROGERS	He's a hell of alot richer than me, I know that much.
M	PETER	But you are taller.
M	SAM ROGERS	That's true. It's not much... but it's something... What did your father do?
M	PETER	He's a doctor.
M	SAM ROGERS	Really?
M	PETER	Eyes.
M	SAM ROGERS	Now that's something.
M	PETER	Yeah... it is.
M	SAM ROGERS	Did he want you to do that?
M	PETER	No, never.
M	SAM ROGERS	Oh. CONTINUED: (4) 62
M	PETER	He was always a pretty miserable guy actually... They're all coming in now.
M	SAM ROGERS	Yes they are.
M	PETER	Have you ever done anything like this before?
M	SAM ROGERS	No... never.... not even close.
M	PETER	Oh...
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah.
M	PETER	Do you really think this is the only... or the... right thing to do?
M	SAM ROGERS	For who?
M	PETER	I'm not sure.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm not either.
M	PETER	So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then?
M	SAM ROGERS	I don't even want to think about it. CONTINUED: (5) 62
M	PETER	Yeah.
M	SAM ROGERS	Just doesn't quite seem...
M	PETER	I know.
M	SAM ROGERS	
M	PETER	Well. I guess we should get back.
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah.
M	SAM ROGERS	Well good luck, you know, in the future... Seems like you'll probably be just fine.
M	PETER	Thank you. CONTINUED: 65
M	JARED COHEN	You alright?
M	SETH	You just fired me.
M	JARED COHEN	I'm sorry...
M	SETH	This is all I've ever wanted to do.
M	JARED COHEN	Really?
M	SETH	Yes...
M	JARED COHEN	I am sorry.
M	SECURITY GUY	They are almost ready for you Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes. CONTINUED: 66
M	ERIC	You as well?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Yes.
M	ERIC	Jesus.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Yeah.
M	ERIC	I'm sorry.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Thank you... Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well.
M	ERIC	Really... and Cohen?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	No... still here.
M	ERIC	Of course... Are you still dating that tall guy... from the Christmas thing?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	No.
M	ERIC	He was very tall.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	
M	ERIC	Wow. CONTINUED: (2) 66
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	I did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know.
M	ERIC	It doesn't matter.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It does. Thank you.
M	ERIC	Have they taken all the phones out of this room? Jesus. Paranoid fucks.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Yeah... I didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here.
M	ERIC	They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or I come back and make... $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room quietly... it wasn't much of choice.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It never is.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)	Obviously looking back, the point was expressed with insufficient urgency... but your point was passed on... I need you to know that.
M	ERIC	OK.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	Eric.
M	ERIC	I understand, there was nothing you could do.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	I guess... at the time... it didn't seem like there was much of a choice.
M	ERIC	It never does.
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	You have kids, yeah?
M	ERIC	What is your package going to look like?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for now.
M	ERIC	Should be pretty good, no?
M	SARAH ROBERTSON	It better be. CONTINUED: 67
M	WILL EMERSON	Alright, hey...(whistles).
M	SAM ROGERS	Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here. I have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes. The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning. There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future. They believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us... as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income MBS today. You should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers. I have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand. As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus. If the floor as a whole is able to achieve a 93% sale we all get an additional 1.3 million a piece. Because of this, if you burn through your allotment by noon, get moving around the floor and start picking up other guys leftovers...
M	SAM ROGERS (cont'd)	For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. I don't have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important. I want you to hit every bite you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers, and your mother if she's buying...and obviously no swaps, its outgoing only today. This is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down, but the ground is shifting below our feet, and there appears to be no other way out.
M	SAM ROGERS (cont'd)	Obviously... this is a very unique situation... if we are successful today we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs... I can not promise that each of you will be repositioned within the firm, but I can tell you that I am very proud of the work we have done together here, I have been at this here for 34 years, and I know... from experience people are going to say some nasty stuff about what we have done here, and what you have devoted a portion of your life to. But have faith that in the greater picture our skills have not been wasted, we have accomplished much, and our talents have served some greater good...
M	FADE TO BLACK.	
M	JOHN TULD	By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one...
M	JARED COHEN	Well done.
M	SAM ROGERS	They did alright.
M	JARED COHEN	I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here.
M	SAM ROGERS	Now?
M	JARED COHEN	(He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends.
M	SAM ROGERS	Of course.
M	JARED COHEN	For what it's worth, you're good... Guess somebody upstairs must really like you.
M	JOHN TULD	Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order.
M	SAM ROGERS	Our guys did what they could. CONTINUED: 73
M	JOHN TULD	You did a hell of a job today, and I thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. Can I get you anything?
M	SAM ROGERS	No, no thanks.
M	TULD	So what can I do for you?
M	SAM ROGERS	I want out.
M	TULD	I'm sorry?
M	SAM ROGERS	I'm done, I want out.
M	TULD	It's been a very difficult day, for everyone.
M	SAM ROGERS	I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.
M	TULD	You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?
M	TULD (cont'd)	For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. I'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. You're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years... CONTINUED: (2) 73
M	SAM ROGERS	That's true, and if I had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. I'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly.
M	TULD	Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? That it's all just for naught? Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797, `73, and 1987... God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. They're just the same thing over and over. We can't help ourselves, and you and I can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... We just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.
M	SAM ROGERS	I'll do it John, but not because of your little speech, but because I need the money. I'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but I need the money. CONTINUED: (3) 73 You're keeping the kid?
M	JOHN TULD	Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's all hands on deck now Sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.
M	MARY ROGERS	Hello! ... I've called the police.
M	SAM ROGERS	Mary.
M	MARY ROGERS	Sam?
M	SAM ROGERS	Yup.
M	MARY ROGERS	What are you doing? CONTINUED: 74 What are you doing?
M	SAM ROGERS	Ella died.
M	MARY ROGERS	Oh God.
M	SAM ROGERS	Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.
M	MARY ROGERS	Well I'm very sorry.
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah... I really loved that dog
M	MARY ROGERS	I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.
M	SAM ROGERS	I was driving home from the vet and this is the only place I could think to bury her. This is where she belongs...
M	MARY ROGERS	Well. You should have called.
M	SAM ROGERS	I know.
M	MARY ROGERS	Are you alright? You look terrible.
M	SAM ROGERS	Yeah. Tough day all around.
M	MARY ROGERS	I heard, Sammy called.
M	SAM ROGERS	Is he alright? CONTINUED: (2) 74
M	MARY ROGERS	He said they got hammered, but got out alive.
M	SAM ROGERS	Good, I was going to call him this morning... but...
M	MARY ROGERS	Well, I am going to go back in to bed. The alarm is on so don't try to break in. Well, you take care of yourself.
M	SAM ROGERS	Is it alright if I finish up here?
M	MARY ROGERS	Yes.
