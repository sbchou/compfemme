M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	TUXEDO	I'm not really in the mood for opera, Armando. ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic.
M	ARMANDO	F Street? You read my mind. Let's not mention this to my Dad... As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat.
M	TUXEDO	I can find my way back. ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
M	BOUNCER	This is a private club.
M	ASSASSIN	I just need to talk to-- THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.
M	BLONDE	Mind if I join you? A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
M	TUXEDO	Get lost, meatbag. THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a GREER kicks open the door-- THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too GREER looks down from the broken window.
F	PETERS	Let's call for back-up.
M	GREER	Where'.s the sport in that? GREER SNORTS and-- PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain- GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a --wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly.
M	GREER	You have the right to remain silent-- But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash, GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Stay with me asshole--
M	PSYCHO	Why would I do that? The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty.
F	PETERS	Is this Kathy Welles...? My name is Jennifer Peters, with the FBI's surrogate crime division... ON SCANNER-- the name "KATHY WELLES," "REPORTED STOLEN," GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He
M	SEMI DRIVER	Am I in trouble?
M	GREER	Nah, go back to work. GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece.
M	GREER	He's a rental. He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
M	CONTINUED:	He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head,
F	PETERS	I don't recommend reconnecting, Ms. Welles... hello? The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES, her eyes open. She sits
M	VICTIM	Aw crap, I'm totalled!
F	PETERS	Your insurance ought to cover it.
M	GREER	--trash pick-up on Maple and 4th.
M	DISPATCHER (FILTER)	Coulda just called it in, we'd a shut him down from here--
M	GREER	Any ID from the rental agency?
M	DISPATCHER (FILTER)	Yeah, got a name from their office in Miami. Ness, Harold P. Harry P. Ness.
M	DISPATCHER	Oh. False ID?
M	GREER	You think?
M	DISPATCHER	Don't be in a rush to get home, Tom. Two surries down outside The Pit, hard-core club on F street.
F	PETERS	Abandoned.
M	GREER	Or something happened to the operator.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Registered to a Cameron Michaels, out in Clarksburg... You call her?
M	UNIFORM	Left a message. GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face.
M	GREER	Optics are damaged.
F	PETERS	Musta cracked when she fell. There's a second? The UNIFORM leads GREER and PETERS past the blonde, into
M	UNIFORM	Couldn't get an ID from this one. GREER kneels by Tuxedo, looks at his fancy CUFFLINKS.
M	GREER	A tux? Kind of over-dressed for a jacker joint. GREER pulls out his scanner.
F	PETERS	Maybe he's real.
M	GREER	Little too pretty for that. GREER lifts one of Tuxedo's eyelids-- CLOSE, shattered
M	GREER (CONT'D)	He's synth all right.
F	PETERS	Looks like the optics exploded... Greer reaches behind Tuxedo's head, pulls out a small THE CIRCUIT BOARD, melted and scorched.
M	GREER	So much for the identity chip.
F	PETERS	I'll call for a pick-up. Maybe diagnostics can make sense of it. Greer stands up, looks toward the Blonde's body.
M	GREER	Clarksburg's just up the 270, let's talk to our witness.
F	PETERS	You always work these kind of hours?
M	GREER	Got something better to do?
F	PETERS	Besides sleep? Greer is already on the move, Peters reluctantly follows.
M	PROPHET (RADIO)	You feel you are free. You can be what you want, do what you want, nothing can hurt you. But you have ceased to live.
M	PROPHET (RADIO)	You think you control your surrogates, but it is they who have taken over your lives. You lie in your cells, pale and fat prisoners, while the puppets walk and dance and make love... Peters BLINKS and comes to.
M	GREER	Welcome back.
F	PETERS	Are we actually listening to the Prophet? We oughta lock this guy up and throw away the key. So is this "know thine enemy?"
M	GREER	The Human Coalition isn't "the enemy."
F	PETERS	You're kidding, right? The Dreads've gotta be behind half the crimes against surries nationwide--
M	GREER	"Dreads..."
F	PETERS	They dread the present, they dread You know this joker's calling for an uprising. In Denver, we got the go- ahead to jam his broadcasts.
M	GREER	Sounds like they're doing a bang-up job out there. Why'd you transfer?
F	PETERS	D. C.'s the heart of the action, right? Plus my ex and I were in the same office, it got a little uncomfortable. You get along with your last partner?
M	GREER	Till he retired. Had no idea he was that old.
M	PROPHET (RADIO)	.But this I promise: soon the abominations shall fall where they stand... and on that day of resurrection, the dead shall rise... MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and
M	LANDLADY	I been having problems with my surrie, this is just a loaner. Is there some kind of trouble?
M	GREER	Nothing to worry about.
M	LANDLADY	Cam's a good tenant, y'know. Pays the rent on time, never leaves the apartment...
M	GREER	Who does?
M	LANDLADY	Cam? Wake up, the police are here to talk to you...
M	GREER	Hello? A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs, contoured
M	LANDLADY	Oh my God, Cameron-- GREER quickly detaches the headset, rips a small
M	GREER	Call the paramedics. While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S
M	TUXEDO (ON SCREEN)	Get lost, meatbag. As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the
M	DREAD	Wake up! Wake up! Zombies! Shitpuppetsl Abominations! He moves to a YOUNG COUPLE, both slack-faced, on standby.
M	DREAD (CONT'D)	Wake up and smell the piss! He starts to UNZIP in front of them.
M	GREER	Not cool. The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread --the REAL GREER. He looks five years older, twenty GREER, a surrogate we now realize, undresses, puts his
F	MAGGIE	Oh, sorry--
M	GREER	It's OK. Come in--
F	MAGGIE	But where's your...
M	GREER	Put him up. I was about to get some sleep. Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer.
F	MAGGIE	You just get in?
M	GREER	Some poor cross-sexual had an aneurysm while he was online, had to get him to a hospital. Maggie winces, disturbed by her husband's job. She flips
F	MAGGIE	I think I need a new stim chair.
M	GREER	Bedsores? Want me to take a look? No thanks, it's just some irritation.
M	GREER	Well, there's room on the credit card. It's been a while since... we've actually been together. Are you talking about sex?
M	GREER	No, I just meant--
F	MAGGIE	Because I think we're doing just fine.
M	GREER	But that's our surrogates. It's not the same...
F	MAGGIE	It's better. I wish that instead of working every night, you would come out with me, go dancing, we used to have such a good time--
M	GREER	I was thinking more like a vacation. An island somewhere.
F	MAGGIE	Bridget said she got an amazing deal on a surrie rental in Tahiti-- she looked just like a native.
M	GREER	I mean a real vacation-- just us. Leave our synth units home. And get on a plane? Her TOAST pops up. Maggie takes it with her coffee out
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Sleep well. She takes her breakfast through a door in the hall just GREER looks after his wife, a bit dejected. In the quiet
M	COMMERCIAL V.0.	Remember... it wasn't long ago. ON TV - the sign "AIR QUALITY - UNHEALTHFUL." Now... a better world. A BEAUTIFUL GIRL ENTERS FRAME, turns TO CAMERA and
M	COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D)	Virtual Self Industries. ON TV - The LOGO for VSI comes on the screen.
M	COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D)	Do what you want. Be what you want.
M	UNDERGRAD #1	Yo, Canter!
M	UNDERGRAD #2	Maybe he's still hung over.
M	UNDERGRAD #1	He's gonna miss the exam. They try the door-- unlocked.
M	UNDERGRAD #1	Aw, Jesus... IN THE BED is a YOUNG MALE CORPSE, a SENSORY PROJECTOR
M	GREER (V.0.)	Tuxedo's operator turned up, student at Yale name of Anthony Canter...
M	GREER	They're uploading his memory file. Seems we're dealing with an actual homicide. PETERS, at the other (much neater) desk, leans in to look
F	PETERS	You sound pleased.
M	GREER	Well, you get a little tired of property crime, vandalism--
F	PETERS	Thought you took your job seriously. Surrogates are extensions of people's selves--
M	GREER	What are you, quoting VSI?
F	PETERS	The Supreme Court. ANTHONY STONE, Greer's BOSS, has entered Greer's office
M	PETERS (CONT'D)	Synthetic units have the same rights as biologicals.
M	GREER	Yeah, yeah. Fact is, most of the people you refer to as Dreads are just too poor to afford a synth. You think they like living on reservations?
F	PETERS	That's humanist propaganda. The restricted areas were their idea, they hate being around surries.
M	STONE	Get a room, you two. He leans between them, hits a button on Greer's computer. --and turns to confront THE HELMETED ASSASSIN. TUXEDO's
M	TUXEDO (O.S.)	Get lost, meatbag. THE ASSASSIN narrows his eyes-- then WHITE LIGHT fills GREER, PETERS and STONE react to this.
M	GREER	Poor kid. Pathologist said his brains looked like soup. What could do that to someone?
M	STONE	Lightning strike, according to forensics. A massive power surge shoots through the network...
M	GREER	Two people in a narrow alley, surrounded by fire escapes, cell towers...?
M	STONE	Got a better idea? In any case, let's be discreet about this. There'll be panic in the streets if the public gets the idea that using their surries can kill them... Greer is rewinding the IMAGE. He points to the face of
M	GREER	Is he the perp, or just some lookie-loo--?
F	PETERS	He's a "meatbag" all right. Look at those scars... An INTERCOM beeps, GREER hits a button.
M	GREER	What you got?
M	INTERCOM VOICE	Next of kin. You sitting down? Kid's father is Lionel Alexander Canter. The Lionel Canter. GREER, PETERS and STONE take this in, stunned. STONE
M	STONE	Stone here. Under no circumstances do you discuss this matter with anyone, inside or outside the Bureau. Got me?
M	INTERCOM VOICE	Yes, sir. GREER disconnects the intercom, STONE moves to leave.
M	GREER	You still thinking lightning? An elegantly dressed CLERK is at the lobby desk, checking
M	CLERK	Dr. Canter is expecting you. But no weapons are permitted in the penthouse.
F	PETERS	We're federal agents.
M	CLERK	I'm sorry. You'll have to leave them with me. At Greer's nod, Peters takes out her holstered GUN.
M	ARMANDO	I work for Dr. Canter. His private elevator's this way. They follow him toward an ALCOVE in the back of the
F	PETERS	You're the one who drove Anthony Canter that night? I gave the police a statement. AT A PRIVATE ELEVATOR, while ARMANDO turns a key, a
M	GREER	is this necessary?
M	ARMANDO	Dr. Canter's rules. LIGHT flashes in their faces as they're scanned. The
M	GREER	Kid liked the wild side, huh. Did his father know? Armando doesn't answer, this is getting too personal.
F	PETERS	Nice place.
M	GREER	Canter must get a piece of every surrogate they sell. CANTER emerges from a study. His face is young, but
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Dr. Canter?
M	CANTER	That's right. You're with the FBI.
F	PETERS	Yes we are. He leads them into--
F	PETERS	We're very sorry for your loss, sir.
M	CANTER	What progress have you made with the investigation?
M	GREER	I can't help noticing, your surrogate-- it's very similar to the unit your son was using... Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four
M	CANTER	I allowed Tony to borrow one of my surrogates when he wanted to spend time in D.C. I encouraged him to take advantage of the cultural
F	PETERS	Wait, how is that possible? Aren't your surries locked to your neural signature?
M	CANTER	I wrote the code that remains at the core of all surrogates. It wasn't difficult for me to make my synth units accessible to my son. Like getting the keys to dad's car.
M	CANTER	I suppose... The coroner says that Tony was online when it happened. Why hasn't the surrogate been returned to me?
F	PETERS	We're still analyzing the damage--
M	CANTER	It was attacked?
F	PETERS	We really can't get into the details of an ongoing investigation--
M	GREER	Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any way to kill an operator remotely. Do you?
M	CANTER	No, but-- at the beginning, all of us at VSI were worried about it. It's why every surrogate has a built-in fail-safe, they disconnect before they can transmit a potentially dangerous signal.
F	PETERS	Can you think of anyone who might want to harm your son?
M	CANTER	I... the sad fact is, Tony and I were just getting to know each other... he grew up with his mother in California. Canter's voice drifts off, he's starting to look far
M	CANTER (CONT'D)	If this wasn't an accident... then it's because of me that he's... I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me. Before Greer and Peters can reply, Canter goes rigid,
M	GREER	Guess the interview's over. Can you imagine what it's like to lose your only child? Greer scribbles something on a BUSINESS CARD.
M	GREER	Not really. You got kids?
F	PETERS	Jim and I talked about it, but...
M	GREER	Lot of that going around. He starts to place the card on the desk before the
M	GREER (CONT'D)	If he thinks of anything else. I'll show you out. As they move back toward the lobby elevator, we remain POV on eighteen-year-old TONY CANTER in the dorm room) as he hauls up a sail in the front of a
F	PETERS	So we're talking mistaken T.D.
M	GREER	Someone targeted Canter's surrie, got the wrong operator. They get to their car, parked in a RED ZONE. GREER curls
M	GREER (CONT'D)	I'm sure the guy's got enemies he never even heard of.
F	PETERS	My money's on the Dreads. Excuse me, the "humans." Greer rips the TICKET from the windshield, tears it in A DISPLAY that reads, "BREAKING THE MIND'S CODE." A
M	VIDEO NARRATOR	.Dr. Lionel Canter's breakthrough experiments led to the technology for decoding brain impulses and transferring the signals to synthetic humans...
M	GREER	Damn. Why didn't I think of that? The two of them move on to an ELEVATOR BANK.
F	PETERS	Thank you.
M	ASSISTANT	Mr. Welch will be with you in a minute.
F	PETERS	She's a little over the top.
M	GREER	Just advertising the product. Ugh.
F	PETERS	It's delicious, if you want it to be. Adjust your interface.
M	GREER	Right, I keep forgetting that. Mmm. So good. They rise as-- --VICTOR WELCH enters. Like most everyone else, he's
M	WELCH	Agents Greer and Peters? I'm Victor Welch, VP corporate relations. He shakes their hands.
F	PETERS	Thanks for taking the time to see us.
M	WELCH	No problem. Do you happen to know Andy Stone?
M	GREER	Our immediate superior. Really. Do give him my regards-- The MALE LAWYER cuts him off, leaning across the table to
M	MALE LAWYER	We're from the legal department.
M	FEMALE LAWYER	Hope you don't mind if we sit in.
F	PETERS	Not at all. I didn't get your names--? You might be interested in a free software upgrade we're offering to all law enforcement officials, better night vision for your synth unit, improved pursuit capability...
M	GREER	Mm. Any idea what could cause a surrogate's head to explode from the inside? On the table, in a plastic EVIDENCE BAG, is a fried
M	MALE LAWYER	Mr. Welch isn't qualified to answer that question. You'd be better off speaking to one of our technicians.
M	FEMALE LAWYER	What does the operator say?
M	GREER	Not much. He's dead.
F	PETERS	A massive brain hemmorhage, it happened while he was online.
M	FEMALE LAWYER	I'm sorry to hear that. But I can assure you it has nothing to do with VSI products. If a man suffers a heart attack while driving, he doesn't have a case against the automobile manufacturer. WELCH nods in agreement. GREER gamely continues to
M	GREER	No one's talking lawsuit. we'd just like to know, is there any precedent for an operator being killed by signals from his synth unit?
M	FEMALE LAWYER	The idea is absurd. If it were possible, it would defeat the purpose of surrogacy.
M	MALE LAWYER	Surries have jumped from bridges, been shot or blown to bits without the least harm to the operators- the fail-safes always kick in. Every case that's been brought against VSI has been shown to be the result of user negligence.
M	FEMALE LAWYER	We can't help it if customers forget to eat, sleep or take their medicine.
M	WELCH	If that's all... a pleasure talking with you.
M	GREER	There is one more thing. The victim was Anthony Canter. The son of one of your company's founders. GREER studies them as they process this news.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Kind of a strange coincidence.
M	WELCH	Dr. Canter has retired, but we'll be sure to send our condolences.
F	PETERS	What's our take-away? I used to be able to read people, back when they were people...
F	PETERS	You mean before they all became lawyers? You made a joke. Maybe there's hope for you, Peters... They head for a MANUFACTURING COMPLEX. A WINDOW overlooks the factory floor. Here, TECHNICIANS
M	GREER	Mr. Waters? Seth Waters? GREER checks the man's ID BADGE-- a PHOTO of a pudgy,
M	WATERS	Hello, sorry. I was in the can.
F	PETERS	We were told you could help us with some technical issues.
M	WATERS	To whom am I addressing myself?
M	GREER	We're with the FBI. He studies the BADGES they hold out.
M	WATERS	Really? Cool.
M	WATERS	Heat build-up like this? Every circuit musta fired at once. Kablooie. GREER and PETERS hover nearby. Waters turns his
F	PETERS	Ever seen anything like it before?
M	WATERS	Not exactly... but last week we got a truckload of GI Joes back for reconditioning. Couple a the surries were missing optics.
M	GREER	May we take a look? ROW UPON ROW of SURRIE TEMPLATES, naked, hairless and Inside are STACKED BODIES in the uniforms of different
M	WATERS	Old soldiers never die... He consults a HAND-HELD COMPUTER, checks CODE NUMBERS on
M	WATERS (CONT'D)	Here we go. He peels back the plastic on another identical SOLDIER
F	PETERS	No bullet holes, no blast damage--?
M	WATERS	Not a scratch. GREER moves Waters aside, looks the body over.
M	GREER	Brand new camos, no mud, no dirt... this thing's never seen combat. Name and unit insignia removed... let me check out the motherboard.
M	WATERS	Didn't come back with one. I thought it was a little weird. GREER stares into the empty eyesockets of the soldier. PULASKI, a gung-ho SURRIE SOLDIER, charges into MACHINE
M	PULASKI	I'm down, I'm down! A CONTROLLER works quickly at a board.
M	BRANDON	Damn things aren't free, Pulaski. Take the snipers from behind this time.
M	PULASKI	Yessir.
M	CONTROLLER	Back on-line. PULASKI lies back in his stim chair, RED LIGHT UP. The
M	BRANDON	Yeah, I'll be right over. He CLAPS a CAPTAIN on the shoulder as he moves out.
M	BRANDON (CONT'D)	Keep an eye on Bravo company.
M	CAPTAIN	We will kick some ass, sir.
M	BRANDON	The United States has the largest surrogate army in.the world. Why on earth would the defense department want to develop a weapon that could wipe out our own troops?
M	GREER	So no such thing exists?
M	BRANDON	If it did, I'd know about it.
F	PETERS	Those soldiers we saw--
M	BRANDON	We routinely remove motherboards and optics for analysis. Now if you'll excuse me, we're in the middle of a peacekeeping operation.
F	PETERS	Think he's telling the truth?
M	GREER	Not when his lips are moving.
M	BRANDON	Bill, we may have a problem. Is it possible one of our ODs is loose?
M	CANTER	Tell me, have you made any progress whatsoever? REVERSE ANGLE, Greer and Peters sit before the screen.
M	GREER	Sir, we are not at liberty to comment on an ongoing investigation.
M	CANTER	Don't blow me off like I'm some goddamn reporter. I have resources of my own, do I have to do your jobs for you? GREER bites back his anger, rises and moves away from the

F	PETERS	I understand you're grieving--
M	CANTER	I'm a target for assassination! I assume you're at least aware of that. WITH PETERS, she looks briefly over her shoulder at Greer
F	PETERS	I appreciate your concern and frustration, obviously we all want immediate results, but--
M	CANTER	I've heard enough of your condescending pap. The people who did this are going to be punished. CANTER DISCONNECTS, his angry face VANISHES. PETERS
M	GREER	You handled that well.
F	PETERS	Where'd you get this?
M	GREER	The freak who was working the door at the club. Got a look at our perp dead-on. ON SCREEN - The Assassin's features HIGHLIGHT, the words REVERSE ANGLE -- GREER types, PETERS watches.
F	PETERS	Try narrowing the search for Dread affiliation... ON SCREEN - a DIGITAL RAPSHEET, the name JACK STRICKLAND.
M	GREER	Eighty-seven percent match. Close enough for government work. GREER and PETERS quickly scan the man's rapsheet.
F	PETERS	Jack Strickland, one of the Prophet's groupies... torched a surrogate display at a department store--
M	GREER	And they let him off?
F	PETERS	No known address... Not a problem.
M	GREER	Ever come down here? It's like being inside God's head... The DOOR UNLOCKS and they enter-- ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar-- The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES, PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic
M	BOBBY	Burglary in progress, Charlie4639- Romeo7812-Sierra8955, need a warrant to shut him down... BOBBY gets a message from his headset, kicks his rolling
M	BOBBY (CONT'D)	Warrant received. This terminal displays SURRIE SERIAL NUMBERS. As BOBBY He can cut off operators from here?
M	BOBBY	Anybody, anywhere. Ssh, don't tell anyone. It's a gray area legally. PETERS isn't comfortable with this.
M	BOBBY (CONT'D)	Relax, we're the good guys.
F	PETERS	You're not a surrogate, are you? BOBBY wheels closer. With his mouth full:
M	BOBBY	No ma'am, you're looking at the genuine article. Bobby Sanders. He extends a greasy hand, which she shakes lightly.
F	PETERS	Jennifer Peters.
M	GREER	They've been trying to puppet Bobby for years--
M	BOBBY	Ain't built the machine yet that can handle this baby. Recognition search caught your dreaddie, screen 11. They move to a screen numbered 11, Bobby taps a CONTROL. ON SCREEN - SLO-MO, a city street, JACK STRICKLAND, a
M	GREER	Ten minutes ago? Where?
M	BOBBY	Baltimore, corner of Eastern and Decker. Got a feeling he's headed for the reservation. Stay here, keep tabs on him.
F	PETERS	What are you doing?
M	GREER	Getting a chopper. Peters takes this in, calls after him:
F	PETERS	You need to get approval! GREER makes a jerking off motion and is gone. BOBBY lets
M	STRICKLAND	.maybe I'm not done with the O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get it back at all. Guy could have a lot of fun with your little toy... oh you can do better than that. I'll be in touch... He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his
M	GREER	We're close! Noise suppression! LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB

M	GREER	Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as close as you can. LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard--
M	BOBBY	You really look like your surrie? PETERS throws him a glare, turns back to her work.
M	BOBBY (CONT'D)	Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged to B-47 down there. He points to one of the many identical female DRONES --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him. A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side,
M	COP	Freeze! STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove. STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER. COP #2 drops his weapon, staggers backward and falls,
M	GREER	Jesus, what is that? STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He GREER looks in the direction he's heading--
M	GREER (CONT'D)	He gets through the gate, we can't touch him. GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER
M	GREER	Pull up, Lopez, pull up! LOPEZ shoots the bird upwards, but-- With supreme effort, GREER gets to his feet, still partly GREER grabs it in his right hand. He pushes past DREADS STRICKLAND, running into the distance. Greer supports GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed. GREER
M	STRICKLAND	Oh my G-god-- why? What do you people want from me?!
M	GREER	You're a killer--
M	STRICKLAND	They were just surries! Goddamn machines! You really don't know? BLAM! A DOUBLE-BARRELED SHOTGUN BLAST throws GREER A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun.

F	BRIDGET	Bustier.
F	MAGGIE	Oh my God. AT HER sensory PROJECTOR, the STALKER is SCANNING through ON SCREEN - fast-forwarding rapidly through PETERS' POV, THE STALKER, face illuminated by the screen's GLOW, looks --a MAN sitting at the foot of his bed. He's very tall,
M	PROPHET	You've been keeping secrets, Jack. TWO LARGE MEN now move into view, flanking the Prophet.
M	STRICKLAND	No, Prophet, I---
M	PROPHET	This is unfair to your brother humans. STRICKLAND tries to get out of bed, Bud pushes him down.
M	STRICKLAND	Please, I haven't done anything...
M	PROPHET	I know what you've done. What I don't know is-- who hired you to betray us? I want a name.
M	STRICKLAND	I-- I swear to God I don't know--
M	PROPHET	Jack...
M	STRICKLAND	He never said his name, we talked on disposable cellphones-- I've never even seen his face! I couldn't tell you who he was if my life depended it! On the Prophet's disappointed, even sad expression...
M	BRAIN.	MOVE DOWN to find GREER (the real one), asleep. An IV, ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine,
M	COMMERCIAL V.0.	Imagine a world where children are safe. Always... GREER, watching the screen, addresses Maggie.
M	GREER	Would you do that?
F	MAGGIE	Hm? Do what?
M	GREER	Get a surrogate for our kid. Our hypothetical kid.
F	MAGGIE	Sure. Why not? They're getting cheaper all the time. A world where every child is secure and fulfilled... ON TV - A LITTLE GIRL swings back and forth, a blissed-
M	COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D)	.free of pain, fear and anxiety... IN SLO-MO she releases at the top of the swing's arc and
M	COMMERCIAL V.O. (CONT'D)	That world can be real. Thanks to VSI. Our software for growing minds screens out destructive, negative feelings... THE LITTLE GIRL lands hard, but gets up laughing.
M	COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D)	Making every childhood a happy one... GREER shakes his head.
M	GREER	It just seems weird to me. Our grandparents thought seatbelts were weird. She nods toward the IMAGE of a SMILING CHILD on TV.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Not like it's an issue. ON TV - the VSI LOGO.
M	COMMERCIAL V.0.	Do what you want. Be what you want. AT THE DOOR, PETERS hovers, making up her mind to enter.
F	PETERS	Knock knock. Greer blinks at her.
M	GREER	Who's there.-
F	PETERS	It's me, Peters, don't you recognize me?
M	GREER	I thought you might've been telling another joke. Peters seems relieved. Maggie waits for an introduction,
F	MAGGIE	Hi. I'm Maggie, Tom's wife.
F	PETERS	A pleasure to meet you. Jennifer Peters. His new partner.
F	MAGGIE	You should have mentioned her. I need to get going anyway, I'll let you two talk business. I'm a beauty engineer. Drop by the shop sometime, I'll give you a free consultation.
F	PETERS	Thanks... I think. You look just like your unit.
M	GREER	Except older and fatter. Sorry if I seem a little out of it.
F	PETERS	You've been through a lot.
M	GREER	They're calling it a concussion-- felt like my head was going to explode. With a brisk RAP on the doorframe, STONE enters.
M	STONE	How ya' feeling, Greer? GREER shrinks back in his bed.
M	GREER	You tell me. How's Lopez? Stone sighs, looking him over. Quietly:
M	STONE	The pilot? They found him dead in his stim chair. Same with one of the Baltimore cops, other's in a coma. Four Dreads were killed on the ground, half a dozen wounded. Greer closes his eyes in misery.
F	PETERS	It's not your fault. You were doing your job. Stone pulls up Maggie's chair, sits as he speaks.
M	STONE	I would have to disagree. You requisitioned that chopper without authorization. You violated our treaty with the Dreads-- we're expecting retaliation. Those poor cops had no idea what they were up
M	GREER	None of us did! We still don't know. I don't think Strickland even knew-- he thought he was just taking down "the abominations."
M	STONE	I'm sorry, Greer,. but- - you're suspended, pending further action. Greer nods slowly, knew this was coming. PETERS takes a
M	GREER	I've been going through my memory files of the crash... ever seen anything like this before? ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in
F	PETERS	It's the murder weapon? GREER nods, STONE studies the laptop, sets his jaw.
M	STONE	It's more than that. It means nobody is safe. The Dreads want us all to be like them-- living in fear, no better than animals. And we've only just freed ourselves, begun to explore our true potential.
M	GREER	We need to get this guy.
M	STONE	We will. Our way of life will be protected, whatever it takes. An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room.
M	NURSE	Good news, Mr. Greer. The doctors say you can go home today.
M	GREER	They said the end of the week--
M	NURSE	Insurance, you know. She smiles, putting his clothing by the bed and
M	STONE	Just take some time to heal.
M	GREER	What about my surrogate?
M	STONE	Hasn't been-recovered. I'm afraid we can't supply you with a new one until this matter is resolved. Peters, make sure he gets home in one piece. PETERS nods, looking at Greer sympathetically. GREER ON MEDICAL MONITOR - the image of GREER'S BRAIN shuts OFF PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He
M	GREER	I haven't been out without a surrogate in a long time...
F	PETERS	It's OK. Nothing's gonna happen.
M	GREER	They wanted to give me something for the anxiety... they call it corporeaphobia.
F	PETERS	Just take my arm. He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out
M	GREER	Jesus Christ.
F	PETERS	We need to get you a replacement. She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away.
M	SALESMAN	Oh you poor guy-- out in just your skin can be scary. No worries, I got perfect surrie for you. He leads them deeper into the store. He wears a clip-on
M	GREER	I like to see my own face when I look in the mirror.
M	SALESMAN	Fine, you no buy off the rack-- we customize, on premise, less than one hour. As they move on, we glimpse CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKES on the
M	GREER'S VOICE	Hello. Testing-one-two-three... THE SALESMAN works the computer, GREER lies in an
M	SALESMAN	No worries, we make you good deal, no payment til next year. Just try one on for size. You like, we lock in your neural code, plastiform your face, you good to go. THE SALESMAN hits a couple of switches, slips a small
M	SALESMAN (CONT'D)	Take a whirl. Greer touches his fingers together--- his body instantly -a pale, hairless SURRIE TEMPLATE in a speedo steps out
M	SALESMAN (CONT'D)	Looking gooood. I dunno... The VOICE is a tinny, far-away sounding version of
M	SALESMAN	Try touching your nose. 40% OFF pokes himself in the eye.
M	'SALESMAN (CONT'D)	Good, good. Takes some time to break in. Base model come with vision, hearing-- other senses optional.
M	40% OFF	Screw this. The surrie FREEZES in its tracks... and slowly TOPPLES
M	SALESMAN	Wait wait wait! I throw in super- sex software package-- fifty percent off!
F	PETERS	We can try a department store-- if money's a problem, I can front
M	GREER	No. I'm a grown man for Chrissake, I should be able to walk down the street without completely freaking out.
F	PETERS	Well, you made it a block.
M	GREER	Here's to self-medication. He takes a sip and spits it out. The BARTENDER turns.
M	BARTENDER	Are you all right, sir?
M	GREER	What is this? The BARTENDER gives him a once-over.
M	BARTENDER	Oh, sorry. We don't get a lot of-- that's synthohol. Just a CPU inhibition blocker in a non- corrosive solution... As the bartender speaks, Greer looks around the dark bar-- GREER continues to watch the other patrons.
M	GREER	You have any real booze?
M	BARTENDER	No liquor license. The BARTENDER shrugs and moves off. Peters sips her soda
F	PETERS	Come here often, stranger?
M	GREER	You know, they really don't look human. You can't tell when you're inside them, but... GREER turns to PETERS, studies her like the others.
F	PETERS	I don't like the way you're looking at me.
M	GREER	But I'm not really looking at you.
F	PETERS	Yeah yeah, this is just a lump of aluminum and polystyrene. Tell you what, next time you're in Colorado, look me up for real. We can have a beer together.
M	GREER	I'd like that. PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	You know, when we started working together, I thought you were kind of a stiff.
F	PETERS	New job, I was defensive.
M	GREER	It's more than that... you're different. Or maybe I am. Greer's embarrassed, shrugs it off. He puts down a bill You probably oughta head back to the office.
F	PETERS	I can get you home.
M	GREER	I'll be OK. He moves toward the door, she tags along.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	I'm thinking you should double- check Strickland's records, go back to the hard copies. See if you can find out why they dropped charges.
F	PETERS	You seem better already.
M	GREER	It's like riding a bike.
M	subway,	GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the
F	PETERS	Where you going?
M	GREER	It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take a trip to East Baltimore. He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Was it always this steep?
F	PETERS	Jesus, Tom, the rez?
M	GREER	Since I'm stuck in my skin, I oughta take advantage of it. Hell, as long as Strickland has that device-- I'm safer this way. He clutches the handrail, starts moving down.
F	PETERS	Be careful. He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator. --a battered SUV, spray-painted with anti-surrogate THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby, sends them The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and
M	RIOT AGENT	Secure. Any biologicals here?
M	NEWS READER VOICE	--twenty-seven surrogates irreparably damaged. Only one dead, the attacker himself.
M	NEWS READER VOICE (CONT'D)	His motive is unclear at this point, but may be a response to the recent incident at the Baltimore human reservation... GREER, in the back seat, takes in this news grimly. The
M	CABBIE	Goddamn Dreads... sure you don't wanna change your mind?
M	GREER	I'm sure.
M	CABBIE	You OK, man?
M	GREER	Just a little carsick. The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE.
M	GREER	Where would I find the, the what do you call it, the Temple?
M	DREAD GUARD	Ten blocks that way, left on Bloomfield.
M	GREER	Thanks. Catch a lotta surries tryin' to sneak in, do ya?
M	DREAD GUARD	Piss off. As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no man's land, he --the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with
M	GREER	Excuse me.
M	PEDESTRIAN	No problem. A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking GREER enters, takes this in. He spots a CLEANING LADY,
M	GREER	Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to know a Jack Strickland? I'm told he worked here off and on. You're here for the service? It's in the park. THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
M	PROPHET	--serving faithfully beside us in the cause of humanity. _I had the privilege of hearing his confession shortly before his death. GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
M	PROPHET (CONT'D)	And I know he would have rejoiced in the day of resurrection, the day for which we are all preparing, the day I promise you is close at hand... So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
M	BUD	Who are you?
M	GREER	What happened to Jack Strickland?
M	BUD	He slipped and fell. Friend of yours? Greer starts to move around him, Bud gets in his way.
M	GREER	I'd like a word with the Prophet.
M	BUD	You and everyone else. MILLER and ADAMS, another goon, now join them.
M	GREER	Strickland was carrying a weapon. If it isn't recovered, there could be serious consequences-- for all of you. IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV.
M	MILLER	You some kinda cop? Where's your puppet?
M	GREER	Needs repairs.
M	MILLER	You armed? GREER shakes his head, raises his hands.
M	GREER	Frisk me if you want.
M	MILLER	No, that's OK. With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head. GREER
M	MILLER (CONT'D)	Hurts, doesn't it.
M	BUD	It's a bitch being real. GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving
M	ADAMS	I think he likes it.
M	MILLER	So give him some more. Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating, Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets,
M	MILLER (CONT'D)	Not gonna give you the satisfaction. Get him out of here. Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the
M	HANDLER	Trouble?
M	MILLER	Some fed named Greer, he wanted to talk to the Prophet.
M	HANDLER	About that turkey shoot in DC?
M	MILLER	Didn't come up. Said they wanted Strickland's weapon.
M	PROPHET	Well, maybe I'll just have to bring it to their doorstep... In the Prophet's hand, we now see-- --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his
M	BUD	Guy like you oughtn't be out in just your skin.
M	GREER	I'm starting to see your point. AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much
M	DREAD GUARD	Come again real soon!
M	WHEELS	Oops. The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY They've customized their surries in completely bizarre
M	EYES	Watch where you're going, meat.
M	SPIKES	What are you doin' off the rez? She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he
M	GREER	I'm not a Dread.
M	WHEELS	Then you oughta return that surrie, looks like shit. WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him--
M	EYES	Hey, it wants to play. EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER
M	SPIKES	Ole, toro! They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES.
M	BOY	Agent Greer. Would you like a ride? The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature
M	WHEELS	Check out Richie Rich. THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from
M	ARMANDO	We got a problem here? The FREAKS retreat with dirty looks.
M	SPIKES	Fascists. The BOY moves back toward the LIMO. Greer follows.
M	BOY	So many unforeseen consequences to the surrogate revolution... I suppose I should apologize.
M	GREER	Who are you?
M	BOY/CANTER	You left this on my desk. ARMANDO has gotten behind the wheel, starts moving.
M	GREER	Canter?
M	BOY/CANTER	It's not safe for me to use my usual surrogates. This is one of VSI's.newer models. Not that the market will be that strong, the birthrate being what it is.
M	GREER	You're having me followed.
M	BOY/CANTER	You know how important this investigation is to me. The man who killed your son is dead. Boy/Canter absorbs this.
M	BOY/CANTER	I want you to tell me everything.
M	GREER	I suppose you deserve that.
M	BOY/CANTER	This Strickland character. I don't believe he could have been acting on his own.
M	GREER	Why not? You stand for everything the humanists hate--
M	BOY/CANTER	Then why would his own people murder-him?
M	GREER	He'd outlived his usefulness. With me all over his ass, he was becoming a security risk--
M	BOY/CANTER	To kill someone remotely-- it would take a virus presumably, one that could get past every firewall protecting a surrie's circuitry-- then once in the CPU, override all the fail-safes and cause catastrophic brain damage...
M	GREER	Presumably.
M	BOY/CANTER	We're talking about an
M	EXTRAORDINARILY SOPHISTICATED	technology, don't you think? The Dreads didn't come up with it, - they don't even like to use cellphones. OK, fine. Maybe we've got our heads up our own ass--
M	BOY/CANTER	Maybe that's exactly where you should be looking. Greer takes a second to absorb this.
M	GREER	So now you're the victim of a government conspiracy?
M	BOY/CANTER	I think this is your stop.
M	BOY/CANTER	Somebody hired Strickland. You'll know who that is when you trace the weapon.
M	GREER	You really don't need to do my job for me. Boy/Canter takes in Greer's disheveled state.
M	BOY/CANTER	Yes, I can see you've got things under control. The limo pulls away. Greer pauses, looks up at the sky, WIDER, the guy taking the jolt is a lanky male model MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in
M	ANDRE	Think my nose is too big...
F	MAGGIE	For what? I'm going to have it replaced.
F	BRIDGET	While you're at it-- I am so sick of twelve-inch dicks. MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a
M	ANDRE	What do you want, we're men.
M	BRIAN	Why is that? Why do we all have to be men and women? I'd rather be-- I dunno, a lion. Or an eagle.
F	MAGGIE	Mm. A spaceship. Or a cloud. A cloud? Maggie shrugs. She lifts the hair from the nape of her A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered
M	ANDRE	Don't look now. Some homeless meatbag just wandered in. Maggie has blanked out for the moment. Bridget turns.
F	BRIDGET	That's Maggie's husband. Hi Tom. She gives him a little wave. Greer moves past them,
F	MAGGIE	Excuse me. She hurries after him. Brian shrugs, grabs the tube and
F	MAGGIE	What happened to you? I thought you were-spending another night in the hospital.
M	GREER	Obviously. You know I don't like you jacking in the house. He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it
F	MAGGIE	Somebody beat you up? How could you go out like that? As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	What were you thinking, Tom? You. could've been killed.
M	GREER	Just finding out how the other half lives. Greer takes a long drink, gestures toward the living
M	GREER (CONT'D)	So what's his name?
F	MAGGIE	Oh please, grow up. I suppose it doesn't matter. Since, as you keep telling me, it doesn't mean anything. Nothing does. Greer pours another drink.
F	MAGGIE	I don't expect you to understand this. But once in a while, I like to be around people who don't hate being alive.
M	GREER	Alive. Is that what they are out there? She shakes her head and returns to the living room.
M	BRIAN	Hey. You really a G-man? Greer pauses, stares at the man.
M	BRIAN (CONT'D)	Can I ask you something? Is it true you guys are tapping into our surries? Watching everything we do, twenty-four seven? Of course not. Greer starts to move across the room again, heading for
M	BRIAN	Wouldn't want him spying on us tonight... Greer spins near the door and, without breaking stride,
M	GREER	Excuse me. Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and
F	MAGGIE	Tom, the table! Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and Soon Greer's hands are cut and bleeding, he's panting,
M	BRIAN	Could we do it again? Oh man, your face.
M	BRIAN	I was getting sick of it, anyway. As Brian picks bits of GLASS out of his plastic flesh,
M	GREER	Guess the party's over. MAGGIE follows GREER to the door. They speak in hushed
F	MAGGIE	What was the point of that?
M	GREER	Does everything have to have a point? GREER takes a breath, bows his head.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I just want us to-- to connect again. To have a family, to have a life. We can't do it through this wall of plastic. MAGGIE pulls away, his BLOODY HANDS have left marks on
F	MAGGIE	I'm sorry, too. But this is my life. She looks at him sadly and returns to her guests. After
M	DESK JOCKEY	Is that you, Greer?
M	GREER	In the flesh. He takes in the damage to the lobby, the police tape, the
M	DESK JOCKEY	You missed all the excitement.
M	GREER	Saw it on TV. He passes the SURRIE SCANNER and holds his hand over a
M	DESK JOCKEY	Says here you're on suspension.
M	GREER	Mm. Just cleaning out my desk. Y'know, you're thinner on top.
M	GREER	Nice of you to notice. You remember where the rest rooms are?
M	DESK JOCKEY	They mostly use 'em for storage. Think the one on four still works. Greer nods and continues in.
F	PETERS	Got your message.
M	GREER	Hope I didn't wake you.
F	PETERS	After what happened here today I couldn't sleep.
M	GREER	You tell anyone I was going out to the rez? Canter, for example? No. Of course not. Greer studies her a beat, decides she's sincere. A sigh.
M	PETERS (CONT'D)	You look terrible.
M	GREER	Not half as bad as I feel. Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the
F	PETERS	No thanks.
M	GREER	Come on. Just pretend to get drunk with me. Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Feel like I've been asleep for years-- now I wake up an old man. Rip Van Frigging Winkle... Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a What are you doing?
F	PETERS	
M	GREER	I'm not sure how kosher this is...
F	PETERS	Relax. It's not me, it's not a woman touching you-- it's just a machine.
M	GREER	Does feel good... better than a stim chair. He allows himself to enjoy it for a moment, bows his You ever feel like it's... over?
F	PETERS	What.
M	GREER	Us. People. The stuff that used to make the world make sense. That made us... human. I don't know, morality, love. Whatever. Yeah, yeah, they were probably saying that back in ancient Rome.
F	PETERS	We always think technology's going to improve our lives, but...
M	GREER	What lives? A beat, GREER sits up and pulls away from her touch. He
M	GREER (CONT'D)	This has become obsolete. Someday soon, we'll all just be brains in jars.
F	PETERS	Maybe not. I have a feeling people are going to come to their senses eventually.
M	GREER	You can't unring a bell. Thought you were the one all into the brave new world. PETERS is staring at her own plastic hand. She looks up
F	PETERS	I found out about Strickland. She gestures to the boxes of documents.
M	PETERS (CONT'D)	All the chaos, I was able to waltz right into the records department.
M	PETERS (CONT'D)	The case files were removed, but there was a paper trail from payroll... Strickland was an informant. For us? Who was running him?
F	PETERS	Wasn't in the paperwork. But he must've been selling intel on the Prophet. Greer has risen, moving restlessly around the room.
M	GREER	So the Prophet has him killed. And we have to assume he now has the power to kill anyone he wants...
M	BRANDON	Where'd you get this photo? GREER sits opposite COLONEL BRANDON at the man's desk, a
M	GREER	It's from my memory. Damn thing put me in the hospital.
M	BRANDON	Wish I could help.
M	GREER	Killed a couple of cops as well. We believe this weapon-- the one that doesn't exist-- is in the hands of the Human Coalition. Brandon is finally losing his composure.
M	BRANDON	If this is true... we're going to have to do everything in our-power to recover it. Do you have any idea how serious this is?
M	GREER	I was hoping you'd tell me. BRANDON looks conflicted, finally opens up.
M	BRANDON	This is absolutely off the record. It's called an Overload Device, or O.D. They're brand new, only a handful exist. But I checked, ran every serial number-- all accounted for.
M	GREER	Not this one. Maybe it never got to you guys in the first place. Who makes them?
M	BRANDON	It's a DARPA design, subcontracted to Pierson Defense. The idea was to create a non-lethal weapon that could disable every surrie in the field. You beam a software virus straight to the CPU. The fail-safes kick in and the operators are cut off. Circuits all melt down in seconds, you're left with a field full of scrap.
M	GREER	You win the battle with one shot. Let me guess. You found a way around the fail-safes. Just a few lines of code, the connection stays open. We tried it on soldier volunteers... once. The virus caused every neuron to fire at the same time. Melted their brains.
M	GREER	So it's an assassination tool.
M	BRANDON	At the flick of a switch.
F	BRIDGET	She wanted blue eyes the size of golf balls, bee-sting lips and a tiny ski-jump nose...
F	MAGGIE	Boop-oop-a-doop.
F	BRIDGET	Exactly. Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares
F	MAGGIE	You talked her down, I hope.
F	BRIDGET	Yes, thank God, we're doing a modified Audrey Hepburn. MAGGIE glances over at Bridget's work admiringly.
F	MAGGIE	I'd love you to raise my cheekbones a half-inch, but Tom would go ballistic. THE DOOR CHIMES, Bridget looks up.
F	BRIDGET	Speaking of the ball and chain... As GREER approaches, a few of the BEAUTY ENGINEERS glance This place is a cross between a beautician's and an auto
M	BRIDGET (CONT'D)	Hiya, Tom.
F	MAGGIE	I didn't hear you come home last night.
M	GREER	Worked late. I'd really like to sit down and talk with you.
F	MAGGIE	I can take a break--
M	GREER	No, Maggie, face to face. The two of us, for real. BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable.
F	BRIDGET	These smile muscles need to set. She exits with a look at Maggie. Maggie stops working
F	MAGGIE	Tom, don't you get it? That body in our apartment-- the one you call real--- it isn't me. I'm right here.
M	GREER	Honey, if you're worried about the way you look-- it doesn't matter, it never did--
F	MAGGIE	Exactly! What matters is who I choose to be. As the conversation gets more heated, co-workers
M	GREER	I married a person, you're choosing to be a thing. And I'm so sick of being surrounded by things-- young, beautiful things.
F	MAGGIE	Well that's your problem, isn't it. if you can be young and beautiful and feel good all the time-- why would anyone choose anything else?
M	GREER	Because it's bullshit. Because we're human, like it or not.
F	MAGGIE	Jesus, Tom. You sound like a Dread. Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has
M	GREER	I may just have to kick down your bedroom door.
F	MAGGIE	I'd never forgive you.
M	GREER	Then maybe I should just move out.
F	MAGGIE	Do what you want... That's a commercial. Greer turns and exits. Maggie glances after him with a On the top is a WEDDING PHOTO of Maggie and Greer, much He places this on the bedside table, moves for the GREER takes this in. He's at his computer, first thing
F	PETERS	What you working on?
M	GREER	Just checking e-mail.
F	PETERS	I think you hide things from me.
M	GREER	Don't be ridiculous. This stuff is awful. He'scalling up a new file-- ON SCREEN - the name "LIONEL CANTER" followed by the GREER sits back, frustrated.
F	PETERS	What does AOS stand for? I keep coming across it on these invoices. "Advance On Salary?" Greer thinks- a moment of revelation. He moves to look What do you suppose VSI has against Canter?
F	PETERS	Against him? He's one of them. 'Course, since he owns the patents on surrogate technology, they must have to pay him billions.
M	GREER	He dies, they still have to pay his estate.
F	PETERS	Wait a minute. You think VSI hired Strickland to kill Canter?
M	GREER	There was a middleman. As he moves for the door, he points at her paperwork.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	To authorize informant payments, agent in charge has to initial... As he exits, Peters looks back down at the documents. Hey, Tom. Thought you were on leave.
M	GREER	Just cleaning out my desk. A moment later, STONE pokes his head out.
M	STONE	Greer! You've been cleaning out your desk for two days. You should be home recuperating.
M	GREER	Just about done, sir. Greer starts to move away, turns back.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	I almost forgot. Victor Welch sends his regards. Stone shakes his head, feigning incomprehension:
M	STONE	I'm sorry?
M	GREER	Guy at VSI. You looking forward to moving to the private sector--?
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Will you finish out the year? We're sure gonna miss you around here... STONE SLAMS the door.
M	GREER	I know it's hard to resist, better hours, better pay--
M	STONE	Welch told you about this?
M	GREER	No. I was just fishing.
M	STONE	You've suffered brain damage, Greer. Let's hope it isn't permanent. All surveillance on the Prophet goes through this office. Jack Strickland was one of your stoolies. Why the hell didn't you say something? STONE just stares at him, narrowing his eyes.
M	GREER (CONT'D)	Two cops died. You knew he had the
M	STONE	I have no idea what you're talking
M	GREER	--because you gave it to him. VSI makes them-- they hand one to you-- and you chose the trigger man. Your own little black op. If anyone looks, they blame the Dreads. But Strickland didn't follow the plan, did he? He didn't give you back the 0. D. like he was supposed to.
M	STONE	Are you done with this paranoid fantasy--?
M	GREER	Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to
M	STONE	I'm issuing orders for your detention. Your mind isn't right, you've become a threat to national security. Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer, GREER peeks up again, continuing his work.
M	STONE (FILTER)	This is Stone! Nakata looks toward the office, starting to rise.
M	NAKATA	What do you need, sir?
M	STONE	Sonofabitch Greer disabled my surrie, stop him!
M	GREER	Just meet me in the garage-- leave the trunk open! As he rounds a corner, he comes face to face with--
M	AGENT #1	Tom, we don't want to hurt you. Greer nods and raises his hands, resigned-- he still Greer has also lost his balance and dropped some papers,
M	FBI GUARD	They're looking for Tom Greer. You seen him? She shakes her head, he presses a button to open the gate
M	GREER	Ever hear of the Human Defense League?
F	PETERS	Sure, the extremist wing of the anti-surrogate movement.
M	GREER	According to this, their number one supporter is Lionel Canter.
F	PETERS	What? The father of surrogacy? Impossible.
M	GREER	Says he's funneled billions into their organization. Not to mention direct support for the man who calls himself the Prophet. Canter's bought him land, lawyers... and enough weapons to start a war. ANGLE THROUGH FENCE - BULLDOZERS, TANKS, uniformed --the BULLDOZERS start PLOWING DOWN the fence. As
M	OFFICER	We all know what we're looking for! Remember these are biologicals, do not fire unless absolutely necessary!
F	PETERS	Swiss accounts, anonymous wire transfers, unattributed testimony-- this isn't proof. WIDER - GREER lies in his clothes on the bed, bone tired,
M	GREER	Not enough for a courtroom. But VSI knew that if Lionel Canter suffered a mysterious brain hemmorhage, the powers that be wouldn't be terribly upset.
F	PETERS	He's not some kind of monster, you know. Canter's initial research was in prosthetics-- for amputees, quadriplegics... people with degenerative diseases. Maybe he feels his technology's been perverted. Maybe it has. GREER studies her with interest, her tone is strangely
M	GREER	I had no idea you were such a humanist. PETERS looks away-- then reacts to something on TV, grabs ON TV SCREEN - HAND-HELD footage as NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
M	ANCHOR	--units of the Maryland National Guard moved into the East Baltimore Human Reservation this morning, in a search for contraband weapons... GREER knows what this is about.
M	GREER	Colonel Brandon didn't waste any time.
F	PETERS	They're looking for the 0. D.
M	GREER	The what? Isn't that what you called it? What does it stand for again?
M	GREER	Overload Device. She nods and turns nonchalantly back to the paperwork.
F	PETERS	So what do we do about Stone?
M	GREER	I call and tell him I'll take early retirement with full pension benefits. In return for keeping his little secret.
F	PETERS	That isn't funny.
M	GREER	I'm not laughing. I don't believe you-- they killed Canter's son, a college kid, his whole life ahead of him! Don't we owe him something? She's genuinely upset. Greer won't meet her eye.
M	GREER	Can't bring him back. They will come after Canter again-- but you're just going to deposit your pension checks, look the other way and let him die.
M	GREER	Maybe he's got it coming. I thought you were a cop. I thought you were a human being. PETERS marches out of there and slams the door on the way
M	RENTAL AGENT	Our nearest rental office is just outside Denver, the car and phone will be extra--
M	GREER	I'm only gonna be there a couple hours. She leads him toward a curtained BOOTH, one of many here.
M	RENTAL AGENT	Do you want to customize--?
M	GREER	Generic's fine. She pulls back a CURTAIN to reveal a STIM-CHAIR and a
M	PROPHET	Have no fear, the day of resurrection is at hand! A team of GUARDSMEN move to surround the Prophet, his
M	PROPHET (CONT'D)	No! Do not resist! The oppressors shall soon fall, never to rise again... Ignoring him, some bodyguards pull HANDGUNS and FIRE on A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE
M	YOUNG DREAD	They've killed him! They've killed the Prophet! Other DREADS nearby react, the CRY spreading. ELECTRONICS and TORN PLASTIC. THE GUARDSMAN's amazed, gets on his WALKIE-TALKIE.
M	GUARDSMAN	Captain, you'd better come see this. Nearby Guardsmen react to the furious DREADS massing
M	GUARDSMAN #3	We need to clear out!
M	SCREEN.	REAL GREER in a rental stim-chair, bathed in RED LIGHT.
M	GENERIC/GREER	Peters! It's me, Tom Greer! He moves along the side of the house, peers in a window-- ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - a STIM-CHAIR sits empty. Dangling GENERIC/GREER SMASHES the window with his fist and climbs
M	GENERIC/GREER	Peters! Are you here?! He tries a couple of DOORS, finds a LOCKED one, turns the ANGLE DOWN-- THE REAL PETERS lies at the base of the
M	GENERIC/GREER	Oh my God, Jennifer-- He can see her neck is broken, he can't move her. Her Suddenly her eyes open. She speaks with difficulty.
M	REAL PETERS	Who are you?
M	GENERIC/GREER	Tom Greer. Your partner. Greer...?
M	GENERIC/GREER	There wasn't time, I rented a
M	REAL PETERS	How do I know--? Prove you're Greer. He's already dialing 9-1-1 on a CELLPHONE.
M	GENERIC/GREER	You can't stand me, I'm old school, seat-of-the pants-- Mountainview, there's a woman, I think her neck is broken-- How long have you been down here?
M	REAL PETERS	Three days I think... Please, hurry... They're on the way. Somebody's been using your surrogate.
M	REAL PETERS	What?
M	GENERIC/GREER	You-- it's been showing up to work every day.
M	REAL PETERS	No, I-- the night your chopper went down... I woke up and somebody was here... I fought with him, but he was so strong--
M	WIPES	Peters is getting distraught. Generic/Greer gently
M	GENERIC/GREER	Ssh, relax --
M	REAL PETERS	He tried to bring me down here, we fell...
M	REAL PETERS (CONT'D)	He took my memory-- the whole investigation. He said he was going to do my job for me. A beat. Their eyes meet as the realization hits
M	GENERIC/GREER	Canter.
M	REAL PETERS	It has to be... oh God, I'm so cold... She clearly had been fighting to stay alive, just to tell
M	REAL PETERS (CONT'D)	Would've been nice to meet you in person... She now closes her eyes. Greer agonizes.
M	GENERIC/GREER	Peters, hang on, please-- it won't be long... He rises, finds an old blanket to put around her.
M	REAL PETERS	Thirsty...
M	GENERIC/GREER	They'll be here in just a minute... No response. He brushes her hair back from her face-- ANGLE UP STAIRS - SURRIE PARAMEDICS rush down with a REAL GREER comes out of the curtained booth in a hurry,
M	GREER	Who's on duty in surveillance--? Sanders, great, put me through-- He's pursued by the RENTAL AGENT.
M	RENTAL AGENT	Sir, sir, sir-- you haven't returned your unit-- Greer ignores the woman, he's out of there. She calls

M	GREER (FILTER) (CONT'D)	Hello? Bobby, are you there? Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the
M	BOBBY	Peters, have you gone insane? Put the gun away, what the hell are you trying to prove? PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN.
M	BOBBY (CONT'D)	She's into the entire surrie database, I dunno what she's-- Peters YANKS off Bobby's headset and throws it aside.
M	GREER (ON PHONE)	Maggie, please pick up-- damn it, you have to disconnect as soon as you get this message-- get off line, abandon your surrogate! You're in danger, everyone is-- CLOSE - "THOMAS GREER" scrolls on the CELLPHONE READOUT. STONE approaching (his surrie is operational again),
M	RIOT AGENT	She'll only speak with you, sir.
M	STONE	Why the hell don't you just move in and take her down?
M	RIOT AGENT	She's got a human hostage. Stone pauses, takes a breath.
M	STONE	That fat ass Sanders. He self-consciously rubs the back of his head, where we
M	CLERK	I'm sorry, you're not on his list.
M	GREER	I wouldn't be. I'm here to arrest him. ARMANDO moves closer at this.
M	CLERK	I see... do you have a warrant?
M	GREER	Listen to me. Dr. Canter is committing a crime via surrogate-- right now. If you don't cooperate and let me up there, you become an accomplice.
M	CLERK	Without a warrant, I'm afraid I can't help you. ARMANDO takes Greer by the arm in a painful grip.
M	ARMANDO	You're gonna have to leave, sir. Armando escorts Greer none too gently to the door.
M	GREER	Ow! Easy, I'm only human. As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left
M	ARMANDO	Are you OK? Greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the man's jacket. Armando's ARM SPASMS WILDLY. He takes a few steps back,
M	ARMANDO (CONT'D)	You asshole. I just made the last payment. GREER rises and hurries to the CLERK, points the gun at
M	GREER	The elevator key!
M	CLERK	I'm calling the police. The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in
M	STONE	Peters! It's me, Andy Stone! Hands in the air, Stone moves down the stairs, stepping
F	PETERS	Who was it, Stone? Who was it at VSI that hired you to kill me? Stone blinks, trying to process this.
M	PETERS (CONT'D)	Did you feel even a second of remorse, when you found out you'd murdered an innocent boy. He was eighteen!
M	STONE	I don't believe it...
F	PETERS	Just tell me what I need to know. Stone considers this a bit, smiles.
M	STONE	We spend years trying to nail you for funding the Dreads-- and now you hand yourself over to us on a silver platter. Hijacking an agent, destroying federal property, creating a hostage situation... Peters pulls her gun and points it at BOBBY'S HEAD. He
M	STONE (CONT'D)	I wouldn't add homicide to that list. As it is, you're going to prison for a very long time. He turns on his heel, begins walking back up the stairs PETERS lowers the gun, reaches into her pocket and pulls

M	GREER	She's dead.
M	CANTER	I had no intention of hurting her. I'm truly sorry--
M	GREER	You bastard, she was my partner, I cared about her--
M	CANTER	Did you? You barely knew her. It was me you came to care about--

M	PETERS/GREER	So people aren't in any danger...
M	BOBBY	Their surrogates are! Hurry up! CANTER stares at GREER, seeing that Greer realizes what's

M	BOBBY	Do it! BANG! A CLEAN HEADSHOT drops PETERS/GREER in her tracks,
M	NOT	He tries desperately to reach the keys himself, but--
M	CANTER	You could have stopped it. Thank you...
M	GREER	Why...?
M	CANTER	You know why. I won't be responsible for the death of humanity. I like the way you put it-- unringing a bell. GREER puts his head in his hands, realizing the enormity
M	GREER	You created them.
M	CANTER	I only sought to give people like me the chance to live normal lives. But my partners at VSI overrode me. They saw a much larger market-- surrogates for everyone. Healthy people. Children. A world without risk, without pain. Without feelings. Nothing at stake. Nothing to live for. Greer rises shakily.
M	GREER	What's going to happen?
M	CANTER	The day of resurrection. As he speaks, he raises a small white capsule to his
