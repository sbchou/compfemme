M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MARIA (O.S.)	...but you took a huge bet on the housing crisis in the middle of the biggest boom anybody'd ever seen. Why?
M	ROBERT (O.S.)	I'm a child of the 50's. My father welded steel for the Navy. And my mother worked at the VA.
M	ROBERT	They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen.
F	MARIA	Is that what's happening now?
M	ROBERT	When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things:
M	ROBERT	M-O-N-E-Y. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 2.
F	MARIA	Was this freshman econ?
M	ROBERT	This was fifth-grade econ. But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst.
M	GAVIN	Here you go... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3. You're disappointed.
M	ROBERT	Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about?
M	GAVIN	It makes no sense.
M	ROBERT	That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there?
M	GAVIN	To sign.
M	ROBERT	And did we sign?
M	GAVIN	No.
M	ROBERT	No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting... And where was Mayfield? What was this "emergency"? What was that about?
M	GAVIN	Did you speak to the auditors?
M	ROBERT	Why?
M	GAVIN	What if... we don't don't close this week... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 4.
F	ELLEN	Look, your grandfather's here!
M	ROBERT	Hi, guys! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.
M	GRANDCHILD	Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?
F	BROOKE	It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs. You're spoiling them rotten.
M	ROBERT	It's my job! It's my job. You guys turned out fine!
F	BROOKE	Debatable.
M	ROBERT	How you doin', son? Good?
F	ELLEN	We had to eat. The kids were starving...
M	ROBERT	No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here?
M	ALL	HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!
M	ROBERT	Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6. What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for, so, thank you...
M	PETER	...and to have sold the company to Standard this morning!
M	ROBERT	That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business!
F	ELLEN	Oh, here we go!
M	ROBERT	Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too!
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much.
M	ALL	Hear, hear! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 7.
M	ROBERT	Kids are wild.
F	BROOKE	I don't know about me as a mom.
M	ROBERT	No, no no, you should have-- I want more "you's" around.
F	BROOKE	It's all about you, isn't it. Four... and nineteen.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, yeah yeah...
F	BROOKE	So what was that all about?
M	ROBERT	What?
F	BROOKE	The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight.
F	BROOKE	You see this?
M	ROBERT	Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can.
F	BROOKE	Peter's got a copy pinned up in the conference room.
M	ROBERT	Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?
F	BROOKE	Why sell our company? We make a great return, we give money to the causes we believe in...
M	ROBERT	My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view.
F	BROOKE	Dad, you're not that old.
M	ROBERT	It catches up alright. And maybe there's some other things I'd like to do. Maybe I would like to spend a little more time with you guys... outside the office.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	What?
F	BROOKE	I'm just trying to imagine what we would do.
F	ELLEN	Where are you going?
M	ROBERT	Office.
F	ELLEN	Now?
M	ROBERT	Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.
F	ELLEN	But, I haven't given you your birthday present yet...
M	ROBERT	I'll be back as soon as I can.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When you get this -- I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 10.
F	JULIE	Okay...
M	ROBERT	Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late. It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	The show's gonna be beautiful.
F	JULIE	You gonna be there?
M	ROBERT	I will be there. Oh wow, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11.
F	JULIE	I made this for you.
M	ROBERT	You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very...
F	JEFFREY	Thank you, Diane.
M	JEFFREY (CONT'D)	So?
M	ROBERT	I'm here.
F	JEFFREY	Guess what's not?
M	ROBERT	Jeffrey, I told you, I'm...
F	JEFFREY	"...working on it," yeah. Well, while you're doing that, lemme tell you what's not working...
M	ROBERT	Jeffrey... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12.
F	JEFFREY	...what's not working is my four hundred twelve million dollars that's sitting in your account so you can pass your audit, the four hundred twelve million that you needed, you said, for two weeks, and which has been languishing now for thirty-two days, while it could be elsewhere invested, earning an actual return, instead of couching the absurd lie that you're spinning.
M	ROBERT	What do you want me to say?
F	JEFFREY	That you're gonna get a signature from Mayfield, and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly, say... by tomorrow?
M	ROBERT	I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly.
F	JEFFREY	When?
M	ROBERT	As soon as they sign the contract.
F	JEFFREY	You know, I'm not the one with the liability, pal. I just made a loan. You're looking at jail for a thousand years for fraudulent conveyance and...
M	ROBERT	...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!...
F	JEFFREY	I didn't get you into this mess!
M	ROBERT	You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13.
F	JEFFREY	...remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine? What did I tell you?
M	ROBERT	Are we done here? I think we're done here.
F	JEFFREY	Friday morning I take my money back.
M	ROBERT	You can't do that...
F	JEFFREY	...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill with one-day call rights...
M	ROBERT	...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?
F	JEFFREY	That's really not my problem, is it?
M	ROBERT	Not your fuckin problem...
M	ROBERT	Let's go.
M	CNBC ANNOUNCER	The DOW continues its uptick this morning on new housing starts to rise 132 points. Asian markets fared less well, especially in Russia, where further nationalization plans caused foreign investment to sputter, leading to various...
M	ROBERT	What?
M	GAVIN (O.S.)	Seven-thirty tonight at the Four Seasons. We'll get it straight with Mayfield then.
M	ROBERT	Good. Very good.
M	ROBERT	Is this too blue?
F	ELLEN	It's the third one you've tried.
M	ROBERT	Ay, yay yay. I look old.
F	ELLEN	You look regal, and wise, and granted a little worried. What is going on? Are you afraid of this meeting?
M	ROBERT	They haven't signed the papers.
F	ELLEN	I thought that's why you flew down there. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 15.
M	ROBERT	So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and...
F	ELLEN	Now come on. It will all work out. Just follow the plan.
M	ROBERT	What plan is that?
F	ELLEN	"Confidence equals contract."
M	ROBERT	You sound like a fortune cookie.
F	ELLEN	They're your words, actually.
M	ROBERT	Then you married an idiot.
F	ELLEN	Okay, but I was thinking, idiot, that, after the deal is done, which it definitely will be, why don't we just take off? Pete's in the best place he's ever been, your daughter is always as brilliant, right? So, I wanna have some fun. I wanna have fun with you!
M	ELLEN (CONT'D)	Let's go to Ravello- the house there. We haven't been there forever..
M	ROBERT	There hasn't been time.
F	ELLEN	We have to make time. We go for a year. Let's take a year and get fat and have fun and go on an adventure. I mean-- seriously-- how much money do we need?. Do you wanna be the richest guy in the cemetery? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 16.
M	ROBERT	I don't wanna be in the cemetery!
F	ELLEN	Oh, by the way, Mary called from St. Victor's Hospital, again, she said they still haven't gotten the check yet...
M	ROBERT	I'm taking care of it.
F	ELLEN	The gala is Friday. Should I be selling my ring? What's going on?
M	ROBERT	I've had to move some things around for the merger.
F	ELLEN	It's only two million.
M	ROBERT	Only two million?
F	ELLEN	Yeah!
M	ROBERT	You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks...
F	ELLEN	I do remember. But I do not remember you being so sentimental unless you were trying to change the subject.
M	ROBERT	I don't know what you're talking about... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17.
M	MAITRE'D	Mr. Miller, good to see you, sir. Your party has already arrived.
M	ROBERT	Where the hell is Mayfield?
M	BARNES	Mr. Miller, thank you for coming. We were just getting acquainted with Brooke and Peter here.
M	ROBERT	I hope they didn't beat you up too much.
M	AIMES	They've been terrific.
M	PETER	Dad, we've been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back-office.
M	ROBERT	I'd love to hear about that, but... I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight.
M	AIMES	Jim should be here in twenty minutes; he suggested we get right into details.
M	BARNES	I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that...
M	BARNES	...assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations, I'd say...
M	ROBERT	I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield?
M	AIMES	He just texted me. He's very sorry, but he's been detained.
M	ROBERT	Detained where? Alright, I think I can leave you with my family?
M	BARNES	Of course. Again, Mr. Miller, a privilege. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 19.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, yeah yeah.
F	BROOKE	Dad...
M	GAVIN	This is the bullshit way you try to close a deal?
M	AIMES	Port? Would you like to have some port?
F	BROOKE	Did you get my message?
M	ROBERT	No. What's up?
F	BROOKE	We need to sit down.
M	ROBERT	What is it?
F	BROOKE	I don't want to talk about it here.
M	ROBERT	BROOKE--
F	BROOKE	I found some strange entries in the "Old Hill" books.
M	ROBERT	What kind of entries?
F	BROOKE	I'm not sure yet, but there's definitely something off. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 20.
M	ROBERT	Alright, come by about eleven tomorrow and we'll look at it then. And Brooke?
F	BROOKE	Yeah.
M	ROBERT	See if you can find out what happened to Mayfield.
M	ROBERT	How're they doing?
M	ASSISTANT	Great. Everyone loves them.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, but how are they doing?
M	ASSISTANT	So-so.
M	ROBERT	Where's Julie?
M	ASSISTANT	She's in the back.
M	ROBERT	Hey, Julie.
F	JULIE	Oh... This is Robert Miller, one of our collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava, who is a talented young artist.
M	ROBERT	Oh, really? Painter?
F	AVA	Drawings.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22. I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	What? Why are you doing this?
F	JULIE	Go -- away.
M	ROBERT	I will take those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall.
M	ASSISTANT	Right there, number seven.
M	ROBERT	Don't tell her it was me. I mean it.
M	ASSISTANT	You got it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 23.
M	PAINTER	...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it a "State of Contemporism..."
F	JULIE	Who's this?
M	ROBERT (O.S.)	It's me.
F	JULIE	What do you want?
M	ROBERT (O.S.)	I'm here.
F	JULIE	Where?
M	ROBERT	I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here?
F	JULIE	Are you serious?
M	ROBERT	Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24.
F	JULIE	I see you.
M	ROBERT	Okay, so I'm serious.
F	JULIE	You just come in and out whenever you want?
M	ROBERT	I thought we should talk...
F	JULIE	One damn night in a month I told you was important to me, et tu es meme pas capable d'etre la...
M	ROBERT	...I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations...
F	JULIE	...I don't want to hear about your obligations. If you cared -- YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!
M	ROBERT	I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now.
F	JULIE	No, no, no. You're here when it's convenient for you to be here. C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means YOU FUCKING SHOW UP! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 25.
M	ROBERT	I'm sorry.
F	JULIE	Why did you buy those paintings?
M	ROBERT	Because I liked them.
F	JULIE	Okay, thank you for helping me get started. But if I'm gonna fail-- then let me fail!
M	ROBERT	Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail?
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image.
F	JULIE	What image?
M	ROBERT	Success.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and that's what they remember. Always.
F	JULIE	You're never gonna leave her.
M	ROBERT	Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go...
F	JULIE	...Where?...
M	ROBERT	There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that.
F	JULIE	Me, too. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 28.
M	ROBERT	Yes, I wanna make it collect...
M	OPERATOR	Your name, sir?
M	ROBERT	Lawrence Grant. Who the fuck is this?
M	ROBERT	Jimmy, it's me. Robert?
M	ROBERT	I want you to listen to me very closely...
M	BRYER	You gotta be fucking kidding me.
M	MILLS	Catching detective wants us to rule before he calls it.
M	BRYER	We've been having the same fuckin' argument for twenty years. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 29. They can't handle one drunk motorist kills herself?
M	MILLS	I'm not so sure about this...
M	MILLS (CONT'D)	Car roll had multiple impacts, but she was here and her feet were down there.
M	BRYER	... So who kicked out the door?
M	ROBERT	Let's go.
M	JIMMY	You gonna tell me what this is?
M	ROBERT	It's better you don't ask.
M	JIMMY	So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30.
M	ROBERT	That's correct.
M	JIMMY	Because I want to be very clear about this: you called me to give you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.
M	ROBERT	No, you're not. We're not here.
M	JIMMY	Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?
M	ROBERT	We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right?
M	JIMMY	Right.
M	ROBERT	Because if anyone checks...
M	JIMMY	Why is anyone gonna check?
M	ROBERT	They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here?
M	JIMMY	No.
M	ROBERT	Somebody knows you're here?
M	JIMMY	No!
M	ROBERT	But somebody knows-- you're not there.
M	JIMMY	Well, my girl...
M	ROBERT	Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...
M	JIMMY	Man, you call up two am, what the fuck you want? She asked me where I was going. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 31.
M	ROBERT	What'd you say?
M	JIMMY	I told her I had to run out a minute.
M	ROBERT	Do you trust her?
M	JIMMY	Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad?
M	ROBERT	Do you trust her?
M	JIMMY	Yes, I fucking trust her!
M	ROBERT	Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours.
M	JIMMY	This is some pretty fucked up shit.
M	ROBERT	Jimmy...
M	JIMMY	No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me...
M	ROBERT	...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'...
M	JIMMY	You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?!
M	ROBERT	Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help.
M	JIMMY	You alright?
M	JIMMY (CONT'D)	Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.
M	ROBERT	No, I just... have to get home... I'll deal with it in a couple of hours.
M	JIMMY	What if you don't make it a couple of hours?
M	ROBERT	Then I don't make it.
M	JIMMY	Call me, alright, and let me know it's okay.
M	ROBERT	Better we don't talk for a while.
M	JIMMY	So what you get in a bind and just call up the only nigger you know? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33.
M	ROBERT	I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home.
M	JIMMY	Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.
M	SERVANT	Everything okay, sir?
M	ROBERT	I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed.
F	ELLEN	Where did you go? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 34.
M	ROBERT	What?
F	ELLEN	I woke up for a minute, you weren't here...
M	ROBERT	I just went to... eat some ice cream.
F	ELLEN	Was it good?
M	ROBERT	Yes...
F	ELLEN	Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in the morning...
M	ROBERT	Ellen...
F	ELLEN	What?
M	ROBERT	Do you still love me?
F	ELLEN	Of course I do...
M	SYD	Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter.
M	ROBERT	And such a person...
M	SYD	...would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 35. But that's only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime.
M	ROBERT	Fingerprints, DNA?
M	SYD	Very hard to collect after an explosion. The real world's different from television.
M	ROBERT	What about cell phone records?
M	SYD	Did this person make any calls from the area?
M	ROBERT	Not from a cell phone, no.
M	SYD	Then they won't be able to place him there.
M	ROBERT	What would you advise such a person to do?
M	SYD	To confess immediately.
M	ROBERT	Failing which?
M	SYD	To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. But let me tell you something, and I'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him.
M	SYD (CONT'D)	Robert...
M	ROBERT	Yeah.
M	SYD	They're going to come to you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36.
M	ROBERT	I know.
M	SYD	An accident's not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now we can probably work it out.
M	ROBERT	You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses?
M	SYD	Nothing good.
M	ROBERT	And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years?
M	SYD	I did.
M	ROBERT	What choice do I really have?
M	CHRIS	You're aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds.
M	ROBERT	Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37.
M	CHRIS	Well, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets.
M	ROBERT	No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.
M	CHRIS	Don't worry. I put the team on different books and I left "Old Hill" for myself. Anyway, I'm here to tell you-- I cleared it.
M	ROBERT	The audit's cleared?
M	CHRIS	The report will be issued today. Actually, I'm calling it my "swan song."
M	ROBERT	You're leaving?
M	CHRIS	Yeah, on Friday, it's a five-year clock.
M	ROBERT	And why?
M	CHRIS	Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're doing. But honestly, there's nothing left to worry about. It's -- great.
M	ROBERT	Get out.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	What? How was it? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 38.
M	ROBERT	What?
M	GAVIN (O.S.)	The show.
M	ROBERT	What the fuck are you talking about?
M	GAVIN (O.S.)	The show, Julie's show?
M	ROBERT	Oh... Oh, it was fine...
M	GAVIN (O.S.)	Mayfield's here.
M	ROBERT	He's here? Where?
M	GAVIN (O.S.)	Sherry Netherland. Checked in about an hour ago.
M	ROBERT	He called?
M	GAVIN (O.S.)	No, Brooke has a friend on the executive committee who said he's taking meetings in his room... Maybe he's settling in.
M	ROBERT	You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot? I spoke to legal. They said Standard will sign once they get the audit report.
M	ROBERT	That's being issued now. How do you know that?
M	ROBERT	Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39. How am I...?
M	ROBERT	Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU PLEASE...? THANK YOU!
F	BROOKE	I cannot reconcile it...
M	ROBERT	Reconcile what?
F	BROOKE	The "Old Hill" Fund. Dad, are you listening to me?
M	ROBERT	Of course I'm listening. Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet.
F	BROOKE	Yeah, but look at the sheet! It can't be right. There's a four hundred million dollar hole here. I mean that can't be right.
M	RECEPTIONIST	May I help you? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 40.
M	BRYER	Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller.
F	CINDY	Is he expecting you?
M	BRYER	Possibly.
F	BROOKE	...the way that this sheet reads, half of the fund's assets are missing.
M	ROBERT	That's ridiculous. That can't be right.
F	BROOKE	I know, it's ridiculous, and yet...
M	ROBERT	Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Yeah. There's a detective Bryer here to see you?
M	ROBERT	Give me two minutes, then send him in...
F	BROOKE	Everything alright?
M	ROBERT	Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later.
F	BROOKE	Okay. And Mom wants to know about the hospital check?
M	ROBERT	Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41.
F	BROOKE	Okay.
M	CINDY (O.S.)	Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr. Miller's personal assistant, right this way.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible.
M	BRYER	Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery?
M	ROBERT	Correct.
M	BRYER	How'd you meet her?
M	ROBERT	Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation.
M	BRYER	Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?
M	ROBERT	Last night, at the gallery.
M	BRYER	Did you stay till the doors closed?
M	ROBERT	No, I think I left about ten.
M	BRYER	Where'd you go? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 42.
M	ROBERT	Home.
M	BRYER	You go straight home?
M	ROBERT	Yeah.
M	BRYER	You stay home?
M	ROBERT	Yeah.
M	BRYER	Your wife home?
M	ROBERT	Yes.
M	BRYER	Okay. Okay, so now, back to the gallery. Did you see her with anyone?
M	ROBERT	See her with anyone-- what do you mean?
M	BRYER	You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with?
M	ROBERT	Not that I noticed. No. No, no.
M	BRYER	Reason I ask, is, that we haven't located the driver.
M	ROBERT	The driver?
M	BRYER	Yeah, someone else was driving. Sometimes, the driver, will go for help-- and he'll die tryin', you know... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 43.
M	ROBERT	This is awful. This is truly awful.
M	BRYER	We're searching the area right now. So no boyfriend that you know of?
M	ROBERT	Actually we didn't talk about personal matters.
M	BRYER	She was just an employee, right?
M	ROBERT	Well not an employee. I was an investor.
M	BRYER	Why'd you invest?
M	ROBERT	Why did I invest?
M	BRYER	Yeah, why'd you invest?
M	ROBERT	She had a great eye. She found me those Bryce Marden's there. They went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that I agreed to fund some of the gallery.
M	BRYER	Would you mind if we searched her apartment?
M	ROBERT	Why would I mind?
M	BRYER	It's in your company's name.
M	ROBERT	Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure, go ahead.
M	BRYER	Now, Mr. Miller...
M	ROBERT	Mmm-hmm? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 44.
M	BRYER	Why would you lease an apartment for Ms. Côte? Is that something you normally do for your employees?
M	ROBERT	Actually I said that she wasn't an employee, but-- I think she'd just come over from Paris if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers.
M	BRYER	So you leased her this apartment.
M	ROBERT	It was through our holding company. You seem a little confused by all this...
M	BRYER	I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.
M	ROBERT	Alright.
M	BRYER	Now, I don't mean to be indelicate...
M	ROBERT	But you're going to be indelicate...
M	BRYER	Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but...
M	ROBERT	Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place?
M	BRYER	Something like that, yeah.
M	ROBERT	It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 45.
M	BRYER	Well that seems to make sense. So we're all good with the apartment, then?
M	ROBERT	Sure.
M	BRYER	Thanks.
M	BRYER (CONT'D)	What happened to your head?
M	ROBERT	What?
M	BRYER	That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you?
M	ROBERT	Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet.
M	BRYER	Last night?
M	ROBERT	This morning.
M	BRYER	Hate when that happens.
M	ROBERT	Yeah. Me, too.
M	BRYER	Well, thanks for the chat.
M	ROBERT	No problem.
F	MAE	Ellen Miller's office...
F	ELLEN	And it, it transformed them, seriously.
F	MAE	There's a Detective Bryer in the lobby.
F	ELLEN	And thanks again for your generosity. Alright, we'll see you then. Thank you, bye. I'm sorry, what?
F	MAE	Detective Bryer.
F	ELLEN	What does he want?
F	MAE	I don't know.
F	ELLEN	Well, I'm late so-- I just can't deal with it right now.
F	MAE	Okay, what about these? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 47.
F	ELLEN	Send them a thank you note, Zappos has been so generous-- Thanks, bye guys.
M	BRYER	Mrs. Miller?
F	ELLEN	Yes?
M	BRYER	Detective Bryer.
F	ELLEN	Did you just call my office?
M	BRYER	Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.
F	ELLEN	Well, I don't have time right now, sorry..
M	BRYER	Just take a couple a seconds. It's about your husband.
F	ELLEN	Well, fine, but, make an appointment.
M	MILLS	How'd it go?
M	BRYER	Well, the wife blew me off-- which was interesting. And he didn't admit to the affair, but then he wouldn't, would he?
M	MILLS	Why didn't you pick him up?
M	BRYER	He's a very rich man. What happened with the pay phones?
M	MILLS	Got about fifteen calls in a three- mile. Two of `em look a little strange: got an incoming-- that's probably a local drug deal...
M	BRYER	And the one we care about?
M	MILLS	Collect call. About a minute and a half. Made from the Chevron station on West Lake Road.
M	BRYER	Who'd he call?
M	MILLS	Cellphone in Harlem. Still waiting on the address.
M	BRYER	So, you're at the crash site. Alright, and... you make it outta the car. Now... You're smart enough not to use your own cellphone. So you get to the pay phone... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 49. and you're a billionaire, right? You're a billionaire-- so whaddya do...? You call someone in Harlem?
M	GAVIN	Robert, I just heard about Julie... I'm so sorry. Her Gallery called. Her mom's flying in today.
M	ROBERT	Her Mom...? Service here?
M	GAVIN	Tomorrow at nine am.
M	ROBERT	Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me?
M	GAVIN	Of course... Are you okay?
M	ROBERT	You reach Mayfield?
M	GAVIN	Not yet, but we'll get him... Robert, I...
M	ROBERT	Thanks. Appreciate your concern.
M	MILLS	Let's flash him.
M	MILLS	Mr. Grant?
M	JIMMY	Yes?
M	MILLS	NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car?
M	JIMMY	What's this about?
M	BRYER	Just get in the car, Jimmy.
M	JIMMY	Am I under arrest?
M	BRYER	You wanna be?
M	BRYER	So let's do this again.
M	JIMMY	Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change.
M	BRYER	You were asleep.
M	JIMMY	Right. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51.
M	BRYER	And your phone rings.
M	JIMMY	Right.
M	BRYER	And it's a wrong number.
M	BRYER (CONT'D)	Why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number?
M	JIMMY	I don't think I wanna answer any more questions.
M	BRYER	And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes?
M	JIMMY	I want to talk to my lawyer.
M	MILLS	Listen, kid, we know you went out there. We ID'd your photo with your neighbor who saw you getting into your truck ten minutes after this call was made.
M	JIMMY	Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer?
M	BRYER	I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide.
M	JIMMY	Lawyer.
M	ROBERT	You're gonna sign him out?
M	SYD	I called in Earl Monroe.
M	ROBERT	The basketball player?
M	SYD	Civil rights attorney. You remember Crown Heights?
M	ROBERT	He's the best?
M	SYD	He's the best above 96th Street- and that doesn't make him any cheaper.
M	ROBERT	You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.
M	SYD	It might not be that easy. If he doesn't cooperate they're likely to indict him on obstruction.
M	ROBERT	What would he be looking at?
M	SYD	Hard to say. With his prior... Five years, maybe ten.
M	BRYER	This is not going to go away. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 53.
M	EARL	I'll call you tomorrow if there's any news. Don't worry about anything. And don't talk to anyone else. You take care.
M	ROBERT	Come on, get in.
M	JIMMY	All you said was you wanted a fucking ride! You didn't tell me you killed that girl!
M	ROBERT	Jimmy...
M	JIMMY	I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far.
M	ROBERT	It's gonna be okay.
M	JIMMY	Like it was your ass sitting in there? Like you know a fucking thing about how it's gonna be?
M	ROBERT	We've got you the best criminal lawyer--
M	JIMMY	--Don't you got your own son for this? Why the hell you didn't call him?
M	ROBERT	Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?
M	JIMMY	Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin' idiot, but that ain't my fault.
M	SYD	This isn't productive. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 54.
M	JIMMY	Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd, what happens now?
M	SYD	We meet with Earl and we go from there. I understand that right now they don't have enough to charge you with anything.
M	ROBERT	Your under suspicion.
M	JIMMY	Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!
M	ROBERT	I am aware of that.
M	JIMMY	And what exactly would you like me to do about it?
M	SYD	Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you wanna go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation, so this is where I get out...
M	JIMMY	Why couldn't you have just stayed?
M	ROBERT	I couldn't.
M	JIMMY	Why not?
M	ROBERT	Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt.
M	JIMMY	Somebody was hurt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55.
M	ROBERT	Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you.
M	JIMMY	Yeah.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. So I've been able to set up a situation for you.
M	JIMMY	What's that?
M	ROBERT	It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that.
M	JIMMY	Are you serious? You think money's gonna fix this?
M	ROBERT	What else is there?
M	JIMMY	Yo, yo man, pull over.
M	ROBERT	What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56.
M	JIMMY	I look like a fucking snitch to you?
M	ROBERT	I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you?
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you. What?
M	CINDY (O.S.)	I've got Chris Vogler from Fremaut accounting, you asked me to interrupt you.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, put him through... Chris...
M	CHRIS (O.S.)	Robert, I've run into some problems. We're doing a "non-recommend."
M	ROBERT	What...?
M	CHRIS (O.S.)	They got compliance involved. I'm sorry.
M	ROBERT	Chris...
M	CHRIS (O.S.)	I've gotta go.
M	ROBERT	Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57.
F	BROOKE	Peter...? I'm looking at some statements right now... How much did you book last quarter?... No, I'm not... No, Peter, I'm really just asking you...
M	BROOKE (CONT'D)	Thirty-five million. For your entire group, right?... It wasn't sixty-eight?... Of course it's a big number... No, I'm not... Oh, Peter I'll talk to you later .
M	BEN	What are you doing in my office?
M	BEN (CONT'D)	Hello?
F	BROOKE	Can you explain these?
M	BEN	Explain what?
F	BROOKE	Old Hill. All the numbers you've falsified.
M	BEN	You don't know what you're saying. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 58.
F	BROOKE	Get out of my way. Brooke...
F	BROOKE	You're hurting my arm.
M	BEN	Can't you just leave it alone?
F	BROOKE	You're fired, Ben.
M	BEN	You can't fire me.
F	BROOKE	I just did.
M	BEN	Who do you think asked me to make those changes?
F	BROOKE	83 You tell me. 83
M	MILLS	He was doing a little dealing a while back, but it looks like he stopped.
M	FLORES	Any family?
M	BRYER	Nah, they're all dead.
M	FLORES	So he's a good student, magnet school, whatever. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 59. Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession. Even so, how come he got probation?
M	BRYER	Well, he had an excellent lawyer.
M	FLORES	How the fuck does this kid afford Felder and Chausse...?
M	BRYER	We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years?
M	FLORES	Miller Capital? He was the fucking driver?! Wow, this guy's good...
M	FLORES (CONT'D)	Where are you at with the kid?
M	MILLS	So far he won't budge.
M	FLORES	Well he's a convicted felon. Go get a warrant, put him in front of a grand jury. Let's see how long he holds out when he realizes he's looking at ten years off the prior.
M	SECRETARY	I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs, he's on a call right now, and he said... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 60.
M	SECRETARY (CONT'D)	Mr. Miller!
M	CHRIS	What the fuck...?
M	ROBERT	Tell me what is going on.
M	CHRIS	I can't.
M	ROBERT	Tell me what's going on!
M	CHRIS	I can't!
M	ROBERT	Why not?!
M	CHRIS	It's not me!
M	ROBERT	What do you mean it's not...?
M	CHRIS	THE AUDIT PASSED!
M	ROBERT	The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed?
M	CHRIS	It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done.
M	ROBERT	Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61.
M	CHRIS	Because they asked me to hold it.
M	ROBERT	They? Who's they? Who is they?!
M	CHRIS	Mayfield.
M	ROBERT	Mayfield?
M	CHRIS	What?
M	ROBERT	They're negotiating. He wants a better price.
M	ROBERT	Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James Mayfield, please... Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time we had a talk.
M	DEFERLITO	...cause it's not gonna hold.
M	BRYER	It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 62.
M	DEFERLITO	What is it, Mike, you're stalled- out mid-career so you're reaching for a high-note? Who gives a fuck?
M	BRYER	This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't it? It's cause he's running again?
M	DEFERLITO	You wanna cost the Judge his seat on a profiling claim? Against Earl Monroe?
M	BRYER	I'm getting a piece of new evidence that'll seal it a hundred percent.
M	DEFERLITO	Good, then come back when you got it.
M	BRYER	I'll have it before you go in the jury room... Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don't wanna lose him. Think about it: if we flip him, you get Robert Miller. What's that worth to Rittenband, and to you for that matter...? Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking years, we watch these guys- they out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm fucking sick of it. Where's the consequence? The guy did it. He does not get to walk just cause he's on CNBC.
M	DEFERLITO	You better not fuck me.
M	BRYER	Yeah... I need a serious fuckin' favor... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 63.
F	CINDY	Brooke's waiting for you...
M	ROBERT	Did we have a meeting?
F	CINDY	No, but she looked upset.
M	ROBERT	Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong?
M	ROBERT	You wanna sit?
F	BROOKE	I'll stand. Didn't you think I'd find out?
M	ROBERT	I did.
F	BROOKE	Then why didn't you tell me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 64.
M	ROBERT	Because I hoped you wouldn't.
F	BROOKE	Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now -- or I am done.
M	ROBERT	I made a bad bet.
F	BROOKE	No, you committed fraud.
M	ROBERT	That's a dangerous word, Brooke.
F	BROOKE	What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trusted you? That you lied? That you lied right to my face? Why?
M	ROBERT	Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing.
F	BROOKE	How. How does that happen?
M	ROBERT	You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said "Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months." So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65. But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY! FOREVER! IT IS GOD!...
F	BROOKE	Until...
M	ROBERT	Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will. It's like a plane crash. It just happens.
F	BROOKE	Well it does not just happen.
M	ROBERT	Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you...
F	BROOKE	Thanks to you, we may all be arrested.
M	ROBERT	Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66.
F	BROOKE	Everybody wins?
M	ROBERT	Yes.
F	BROOKE	If the company sells. If I lie for you.
M	ROBERT	You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it.
F	BROOKE	I'm the Chief Investment Officer of this company. What do you think they'll say at the depositions? "She didn't know?" They'll take away my brokerage license- failure to supervise you -- my name in every paper and blog while I visit your ass in jail!
M	ROBERT	What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt?
F	BROOKE	What... gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions?
M	ROBERT	Because it's my job!
F	BROOKE	No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And I am your partner.
M	ROBERT	You are not my partner! You work for me! That's right. You work for me! Everybody works for me! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67. Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	There's something I wanna tell you. And whatever you decide I won't blame you... I'm on my own path. It's up to you to move with it or against it. But I'm the patriarch; that's my role. And I have to play it.
F	BROOKE	For a moment I thought you were gonna say you were sorry.
M	ROBERT	I'm sorry.
M	JIMMY	Oh, man, what?
M	BRYER	Jimmy, take a ride with me.
M	JIMMY	Where? Back to the station?
M	BRYER	No man, just get in the car.
M	JIMMY	What if I say no? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 68.
M	BRYER	I'm not threatening you. I'm just asking you -- take a ride with me.
M	JIMMY	Alright, man, what?
M	BRYER	Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple. I know you went to pick him up.
M	JIMMY	This is what you wanna talk about? I told you I ain't makin' no more statements.
M	BRYER	And I know why.
M	JIMMY	Somebody cares?
M	BRYER	Take a look at this. I've got his phone calls, I got his text messages. I've got the relationship with the girl. And they were fucking, by the way. And then I've got you. I've got the time log from the pay phone. I've a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough.
M	JIMMY	Where you got that...? That's bullshit, cause I didn't do it. That's impossible.
M	BRYER	Really? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 69. You lied to me. You lied to the police. You obstructed justice.
M	JIMMY	Talk to Earl, Detective.
M	BRYER	Fuck Earl! You see this? This means that tomorrow, grand jury hears your case in court. And tomorrow in court I'm gonna ask for a felony obstruction indictment, and with with your prior, you are going to prison for fifteen fucking years... You might get out in ten. You'll be what then? Thirty-three, with no job, no girl, no life. Look: I know you think Miller's your friend.
M	JIMMY	Who's Miller?
M	BRYER	I know about your father.
M	JIMMY	You don't know a Goddamn thing about my father.
M	BRYER	I know Miller paid his bills while he was dying. I know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge. That doesn't add up to this.
M	JIMMY	You done?
M	BRYER	Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call? Calls you. Why do you think that is? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 70. `Cause you're disposable- you're the one person he could call that just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're a- you're a throwaway. You're just another part of his transaction.
M	JIMMY	Will you open the door?
M	BRYER	So what, what? You're his new nigger now?
M	JIMMY	Open-- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
M	BRYER	You didn't kill that girl. He did.
M	JIMMY	Will you -- open -- the door?
M	BRYER	He's using you. I know it - you know it. Do the right thing. Now get outta my fuckin' car.
M	SYD	He's gonna walk.
M	ROBERT	You're certain?
M	SYD	Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be? A phone call doesn't make him a liar. But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 71.
M	ROBERT	He's not like us.
M	SYD	Is that a good thing?
M	ROBERT	I don't know.
M	SYD	How's Ellen?
M	ROBERT	She's good. Fine. Why?
M	SYD	I heard something...
M	ROBERT	Yes...?
M	SYD	She met with Gil Deuchman.
M	ROBERT	The estate lawyer?
M	SYD	Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?
M	ROBERT	Not to me.
M	DEFERLITO	That was the early morning of April 11th.
M	JIMMY	Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72.
M	DEFERLITO	You received a phone call?
M	JIMMY	Yes.
M	DEFERLITO	Who called you?
M	JIMMY	It was a wrong number.
M	DEFERLITO	That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?
M	JIMMY	No.
M	DEFERLITO	You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this court?
M	JIMMY	I'm not lying.
M	DEFERLITO	I'm going to introduce into evidence People's A. This is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the photograph, would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner?
M	JIMMY	This is crazy.
M	EARL	You're gonna have to answer that.
M	DEFERLITO	Mr. Grant, please answer the question. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 73.
M	JIMMY	April 11th, two thirty-three am.
M	DEFERLITO	Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the same photograph, would you please read the license plate number of the vehicle passing through the toll?
M	JIMMY	D D G five five four two.
M	DEFERLITO	This is People's B, a printout from the Department of Motor Vehicles plate registry... Mr. Grant, directing your attention to that printout, are those numbers on the toll photograph the same ones that are on your own license plate?
M	DEFERLITO (CONT'D)	Mr. Grant?
M	JIMMY	Yes.
M	DEFERLITO	Yes, the numbers are the same?
M	JIMMY	Yes.
M	DEFERLITO	How do you explain that?
M	JIMMY	I can't.
M	DEFERLITO	But that is your car in this photograph, isn't it?
M	JIMMY	No.
M	DEFERLITO	No, that is not your car? Answer the question, Mr. Grant. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 74.
M	JIMMY	This is not my car in this picture. I don't know how you all did that, but this is not my car.
M	DEFERLITO	You expect this grand jury to believe that that is not your car when there is a printout from the department of motor vehicles...
M	EARL	That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
M	DEFERLITO	Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're not permitted to go on record.
M	EARL	Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?
M	JIMMY	They're lying!
M	EARL	Okay, now here's what...
M	BRYER	I can halt the decision.
M	EARL	We need a minute, Detective.
M	BRYER	What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute? Cause if you do we could...
M	JIMMY	You can get the fuck outta my face. How `bout that?. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 75.
M	BRYER	So you wanna keep playing games? Or you ready to tell me something?
M	EARL	Detective, I need to talk to my client. Now if you would just please...
M	JIMMY	How you- How you all just gonna lie like that? Huh? How you all just gonna lie?!
M	BRYER	We didn't lie. You lied.
M	JIMMY	That wasn't my car.
M	EARL	...Jimmy, don't say anything else.
M	BRYER	Sure it wasn't. And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone? He stopped at the Chevron to make a late night sale?
M	JIMMY	That picture was some bullshit...
M	EARL	...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's going on?
M	BRYER	Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one.
M	BRYER (CONT'D)	Last chance.
M	EARL	Wait here. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 76.
M	ASSISTANT	Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.
M	ROBERT	I am so, so sorry.
F	SANDRINE	I just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter.
M	ROBERT	No...
F	SANDRINE	You believed in her, and you gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy.
M	ROBERT	It's just... not fair, is it?
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	This shouldn't have happened. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 77.
F	ELLEN	...she's rail thin. She's a blond. I would not have known who she was if she hadn't come up and introduced herself to me. She looked totally different... and... You're going straight to level six don't you think you better pace yourself a little bit?
F	BROOKE	I'm good. I wanna run.
F	ELLEN	Everything okay with you and Tom?
F	BROOKE	We're fine.
F	ELLEN	Are you worried about the deal closing?
F	BROOKE	No.
F	ELLEN	You want me to guess? Brookie, come on, don't be silly, tell me what's...
F	BROOKE	You know, I can't stay for breakfast I have to just... I have to get in to work, I don't know what I was thinking.
F	ELLEN	Did you uh, finish the deal with the hospital? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 78.
F	BROOKE	No.
F	ELLEN	Did he write the check?
F	BROOKE	No.
F	ELLEN	Why not?
F	BROOKE	Issues related to the closing.
F	ELLEN	We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
F	BROOKE	I'm not lying to you. It's complicated; you wouldn't understand.
F	ELLEN	Uh, I know that a policeman showed up at the office? Do you know what that's about?
F	BROOKE	I honestly have no idea.
F	ELLEN	What about your father's head- where he cut his head and the pain that he's hiding in his stomach and, now For some reason that's way to complicated for me to understand, there's no money for a routine gift? Does that seem a little strange to you?
F	BROOKE	Of course it's strange.
F	ELLEN	So tell me what's happening. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 79.
F	BROOKE	What do you want me to say? He's my dad. I have to trust him. No. You have to do what's right for you. Not him, not me, not anyone. This is your life.
F	BROOKE	I love you. I gotta go.
F	ELLEN	Fuck.
M	ROBERT	You keep sending people to my office to "do business."
M	MAYFIELD	They're just getting acquainted.
M	ROBERT	With the intricacies of my operation so that you can... not buy it? Just coffee, please.
M	MAYFIELD	You remember what it was like on our side of the fence. Everything just moves... a little slower. Plus this whole audit mess doesn't help. You know, clearing that all up...
M	ROBERT	Fuck you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80.
M	MAYFIELD	Excuse me...?
M	ROBERT	FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you.
M	MAYFIELD	Robert, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot...
M	ROBERT	No, no, no. Forget it, forget it... Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of 18 Million? And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars? Is that what it is? You've also lost approximately... THREE AND A HALF BILLION FOR YOUR INVESTORS- TELL ME -- WHY - THE FUCK - DO I - NEED YOU?
M	MAYFIELD	Let's just calm down...
M	ROBERT	...so we issue a press release today, say there is no deal, never was a deal. You're not gonna be buying Old Hill, you're not gonna be buying Quantum- you're not gonna be buying anything; You? You're just a browser. Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my earnings, and while I SOAR on princely wings, to my next winning enterprise, your stock drops another couple bucks on yet another - failed - acquisition - attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn't it? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 81.
M	MAYFIELD	Your price is too high.
M	ROBERT	You have a nice day, James.
M	MAYFIELD	Four hundred.
M	ROBERT	Five-fifty.
M	MAYFIELD	Four-fifty.
M	ROBERT	Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no? And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can.
M	MAYFIELD	It's a deal.
M	ROBERT	One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her.
M	MAYFIELD	Alright.
M	ROBERT	And you're gonna have to make my son a VP.
M	MAYFIELD	Robert...
M	ROBERT	No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no?
M	MAYFIELD	Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82. What are you doing?
M	ROBERT	I'm writing the deal.
M	MAYFIELD	Are you serious?
M	ROBERT	I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it.
M	MAYFIELD	I'll send over a draft of the press release.
M	MAYFIELD (CONT'D)	Are you all right?
M	ROBERT	I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...?
M	MAYFIELD	Six hundred. And you would've taken...?
M	ROBERT	Four seventy-five.
M	MAYFIELD	So we made a good deal.
M	ROBERT	Yeah.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83.
M	ROBERT	...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions?
M	PETER	Will we get new business cards?
M	ROBERT	Yes, everyone but you. Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happen
M	GAVIN	So how'd you make Mayfield come around?
M	ROBERT	I met his price. I just took it out of your share.
M	GAVIN	Robert?
M	ROBERT	Yeah.
M	GAVIN	Good work.
M	ROBERT	Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Yeah. It's not good... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 84.
M	ROBERT (PRE-LAP)	Hello.
M	JIMMY	You want something to drink?
M	ROBERT	What you got?
M	JIMMY	Not much.
M	ROBERT	You got any milk?
M	JIMMY	No.
M	ROBERT	I'll take a water.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Where are you going?
M	JIMMY	What?
M	ROBERT	The boxes.
M	JIMMY	I was planning on Virginia, but it looks like I'm not going anymore.
M	JIMMY (CONT'D)	You waiting for me to say something? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 85.
M	ROBERT	I told you not to take the toll.
M	JIMMY	Yes, you did.
M	ROBERT	I said "Listen to what I have to tell you and follow my directions, listen to me closely, do the following just like I say."
M	JIMMY	Yes. You said all that.
M	ROBERT	But you took the toll anyway.
M	JIMMY	No, I did not.
M	ROBERT	Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie to me...
M	JIMMY	I'm not lying! I took ninety-five all the Goddamn way there. I did what you said: I didn't stop. I didn't take the Triborough. I followed all your fucking instructions.
M	ROBERT	So where'd they get the photograph from?
M	JIMMY	You tell me.
M	ROBERT	So, you're saying... it's a fake?
M	JIMMY	How'd you get so fuckin' rich again?
M	ROBERT	Don't be such a wiseass...
M	JIMMY	Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man! Earl's telling me it could be ten years? Ten fucking years! How much are ten years worth, Robert? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86. Look man, I told you, I ain't no fuckin snitch, but this is bad. This is real bad. Reina and I got a whole plan we're about to make happen next week!
M	ROBERT	What plan?
M	JIMMY	I got money saved up; I'm buying a business.
M	ROBERT	What business?
M	JIMMY	I bought an Applebee's.
M	ROBERT	What's an Applebee's?
M	JIMMY	It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's a chain restaurant.
M	ROBERT	You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?
M	JIMMY	Is this really what you came here to talk about? What are you gonna do?
M	ROBERT	It's not really that simple, Jimmy. I'm in a situation now.
M	JIMMY	What situation?
M	ROBERT	I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that?
M	JIMMY	Yeah but what about me? What about my situation? They showed me pictures, man; that's fucked up what you did. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87.
M	ROBERT	It was an accident.
M	JIMMY	And yeah, I know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but -- you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Now you know I care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up. Why are you putting me in this position, man? Why are you putting me in this situation?
M	ROBERT	Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer?
M	JIMMY	Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose.
M	ROBERT	Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit.
F	REINA	You gotta give him up.
M	JIMMY	You said take the money.
F	REINA	That was to keep quiet, not to go away. What's he offering you now?
M	JIMMY	What can he offer me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88.
M	SYD (O.S.)	We went to the toll authority. They said they gave the tape to the cops. I've requested our investigator go examine it at the evidence room, but honestly what's the point?
M	ROBERT	He says he didn't take the toll.
M	SYD (O.S.)	And you believe him?
M	ROBERT	Does Standard have clawback? What? What do you mean?
M	ROBERT	Let's just say I decide to go in... Have you lost your mind?
M	ROBERT	No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal? No, what's done is done. There's no intent to defraud. You haven't warranted any behavior. So it's just money.
M	ROBERT	Four years, you think? At this point- I dunno, they're not gonna make it easy.... I really suggest you think about this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 89.
M	ROBERT	Call the DA, get it started.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where she was going tonight...? Aha... No, I'm sure... I'll try her cell.
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no, no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell him to get his car, tell him to meet us at my house in twenty minutes... And, Syd...? Bring a notary.
M	BRENT	Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night supervisor. How can I help you?
M	EARL	Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm executing a criminal evidence request. I need to get a look at one of your lane tapes.
M	BRENT	I don't understand. This says you want to look at a tape made ten minutes ago...?
M	ROBERT	Wait. Wait. Just wait.
M	EARL	Okay, they won't release tapes without a court order, but they did give me a print out, the same kind they used at Jimmy's indictment.
M	ROBERT	The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	You got Jimmy's?
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	Son of a bitch.
M	RITTENBAND	Well they look a little different to me, too... Is there a reason you haven't allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to conduct his own analysis? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92.
M	DEFERLITO	We've had some issues regarding chain-of-custody...
M	RITTENBAND	...You don't have them anymore. You're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour.
M	DEFERLITO	I'm afraid that's not possible.
M	RITTENBAND	Where's the tape? Am I not speaking loud enough?
M	BRYER	Your honor...
M	RITTENBAND	Yes?
M	DEFERLITO	It seems there's been...
M	RITTENBAND	...Let him tell me.
M	BRYER	We don't know where it is.
M	RITTENBAND	Come again?
M	BRYER	It's not in the evidence locker.
M	RITTENBAND	Where is it?
M	BRYER	We don't know.
M	RITTENBAND	I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape?
M	BRYER	We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.
M	RITTENBAND	Hmmm... In light of these developments, and I would think you should be very happy to hear this, with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going to offer Mr. Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment.
M	DEFERLITO	I don't feel comfortable with that, your honor.
M	RITTENBAND	Further I'm going to put all charges against Mr. Grant under seal. This case is dismissed with prejudice and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON, Detective. If you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him, but Mr. Grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter. This is over. Do I have your understanding?
M	EARL	Thank you.
M	RITTENBAND	Close the door, detective, please...
M	RITTENBAND (CONT'D)	You finessed these, didn't you...?
M	BRYER	I'm sorry?
M	RITTENBAND	...You finessed it. I know it, and you know it.
M	No response.	Goldenrod - 4.17.11 94. I know who you're after. I saw all the evidence, not just the toll photo. You gotta get him the right way.
M	BRYER	Oh, okay. So let me get this straight: What you're telling me is I'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing LOUD enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore?
M	RITTENBAND	Get the fuck outta of my office.
M	BRYER	Yes, your honor.
M	BRYER	Well when do you expect her...? When do you expect her? Okay, well so I don't have to call a ninth time, will you take down what I'm sayin', word for word...? Okay, you got a pencil? You ready? Okay, here goes: "Mrs. Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do you really think I am?"
M	ROBERT	You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95.
M	JIMMY	And this piece of paper makes everything okay?
M	ROBERT	No, it makes it easier.
M	JIMMY	You worried I'm gonna say something?
M	ROBERT	No.
M	JIMMY	Robert, look: you asked me to come meet you and I'm here, but I came because I wanted to get something straight between us: we're even.
M	ROBERT	Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did... Was way beyond the money.
M	JIMMY	Nothing's beyond money for you.
M	ROBERT	Thanks a lot.
M	JIMMY	And if I take this, then what does that say about me? Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money and do something good with it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 96.
M	ROBERT	Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there...? I don't wanna get there too soon...
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	You okay? What is it?
F	ELLEN	You spoke to Brooke?
M	ROBERT	Did she tell you that?
F	ELLEN	No. She didn't have to.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...
F	ELLEN	...you explained, did you? Did you tell her everything?
M	ROBERT	Yes.
F	ELLEN	Everything? Lift up your shirt.
M	ROBERT	What?
F	ELLEN	Lift up -- your shirt. Did you tell her about that?
M	ROBERT	Ellen I don't know what you think you know...
F	ELLEN	Oh, don't treat me like an idiot. You've been sneaking off to see her for months. You don't think I know that?
M	ROBERT	What do you think you know?
F	ELLEN	I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your- gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. I cared about our home. And now you have brought this to our door.
M	ROBERT	I did what was necessary.
F	ELLEN	No you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests.
M	ROBERT	For my interests?
F	ELLEN	Yes.
M	ROBERT	Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business.
F	ELLEN	This isn't about your business, this is our life! Where do you think we're going tonight? Why do you think I've even tolerated this for so long?
M	ROBERT	What you've tolerated? Wow!
F	ELLEN	I'm glad you find that funny. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98.
M	ROBERT	What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them?
F	ELLEN	I didn't ask you because I didn't want you to lie.
M	ROBERT	It's cause you didn't want to give `em up!
F	ELLEN	But I thought that we had an understanding. And you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it.
M	ROBERT	No, I kept her out.
F	ELLEN	When you made Brooke complicit-- when you risked her future-- and I'm done.
M	ROBERT	What is this?
F	ELLEN	Read it.
M	ROBERT	"All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?" Did you really expect me to sign this thing?
F	ELLEN	You're not following. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 99.
M	ROBERT	Apparently not, no. No.
F	ELLEN	Okay, uhm, the police have been trying to talk me. I assume they want to know where you were that night. And you know what? I'm not gonna lie for you anymore. Not unless you sign that.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.
F	ELLEN	I think you'll find a way to manage. I'm sure you have all kinds of things offshore for a rainy day.
M	ROBERT	This is fuckin' crazy.
F	ELLEN	No, if you sign, then I'll tell your lie. I'll say you were at home with me that night, all night, together, here, and you'll be free and clear. And the people who need our money will get it. That's my price.
M	ROBERT	You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that!
F	ELLEN	Well then... I'll have to tell them that you came home at four-thirty bruised and bleeding...
M	ROBERT	That's fucking ridiculous! What... Are you trying to blackmail me?
F	ELLEN	I think we call it negotiating. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 100.
M	ROBERT	You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way.
F	ELLEN	You know what, it'll cause just enough trouble- the kind of trouble that you don't want-- In fact, according to my lawyer Fucking lawyer...
F	ELLEN	It's enough to give them probable cause and then they can subpoena your cell phone, GPS, DNA,
M	ROBERT	Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!
F	ELLEN	And whatever else they can think of. So really Robert what you have is a choice: you can spend the next three years in court and in the tabloids or-- you can be at your business.
M	ROBERT	You won't do it. You won't do this. You won't do it to the kids.
F	ELLEN	Just try me. You broke -- our little girl's heart.
M	ROBERT	It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that.
F	ELLEN	I do, but she didn't.
M	ROBERT	She'll be better for it. The world is cold. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 101.
F	ELLEN	Then you're gonna need a warm coat.
M	AIMES	There's just one more thing... And I hate to mention it now, but I just received it...
M	MAYFIELD	Speak, John.
M	AIMES	I had Stern Marling run a secondary audit on the Miller financials.
M	MAYFIELD	Who authorized this?
M	AIMES	I did.
M	MAYFIELD	And what did you conclude?
M	AIMES	It's in front of you.
M	MAYFIELD	I didn't ask you what the paper said, John. I asked you what you thought. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 102.
M	AIMES	Well... what do you think?
M	MAYFIELD	I think... I think... that I don't see anything wrong here.
F	BROOKE	...and to receive this prestigious award, I invite now to the stage the man who led this generous effort, and whose financial trading firm, Miller Capital, has just this morning been acquired by Standard Bank and Trust, a dedicated businessman, family man, scholar, philanthropist and all-around humanitarian, a man I am lucky to call -- my mentor, my friend -- and my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...
M	FADE TO BLACK.
