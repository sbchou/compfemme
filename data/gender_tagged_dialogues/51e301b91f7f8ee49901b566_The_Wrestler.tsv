F	CASSIDY	There's nothing like experience. I've done things your little fiancee's never dreamed of...
M	DUDE #2	Yeah, like graduate in 1985.
M	RANDY	Apologize to this lady.

M	RANDY (CONT'D)	We were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. Any wrestling fan, they know all about it.
F	CASSIDY	Million and a half? Shit.
M	RANDY	Yeah, it was big. So a rematch... History all over again.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Goddamn you are smokin'.

M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Jesus.
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	You're bleeding.
M	RANDY	Got cut tonight.
F	CASSIDY	You okay?
M	RANDY	Ah, it's nothing.
F	CASSIDY	And they say wrestling's fake.
M	RANDY	How's this for fake? What's that from?
M	RANDY	1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. Loose nail tore the bicep open.
F	CASSIDY	Ow. Fuck.
M	RANDY	I got even better. 1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. Magnificent tossed me out of the ring. Landed on my shoulder, clavicle snapped in half.
F	CASSIDY	Doesn't it hurt?
M	RANDY	Not when they're going crazy for you...
F	CASSIDY	"He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we were healed."
M	RANDY	What's that?
F	CASSIDY	It's from "Passion of the Christ". You never seen it? Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	It's, like, so inspiring. They throw everything at Him. Whips, arrows, rocks... Just beat the living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours. And He just takes it.
M	RANDY	Huh. I'll have to check it out.
F	CASSIDY	The sacrificial Ram...
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Ah, shit.
M	CLUB D.J. (O.S.)	And now, please welcome to the Cheetah's stage...
M	CLUB D.J. (O.S.) (CONT'D)	...the lovely Cassidy!

M	LEX LETHAL	Nice. Two, two-fifty... You been there. The Ricky Whipsaw memorial benefit.
M	RANDY	That place?
M	LEX LETHAL	Should get a good gate. DiFusco says he's gotten like 20 calls last two days alone.
M	RANDY	God bless hardcore...
M	RANDY	Whatcha think?
M	LEX LETHAL	Cookie trays were better.
M	LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)	Hell, yeah.

M	DR. TARACHANDANI	It's all over your blood work.
M	RANDY	Maybe once in a while.
M	DR. TARACHANDANI	Well, it has to be never.
M	DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)	As for exercise, it's still okay, as long as it's moderate.
M	RANDY	So, like, wrestling...
M	DR. TARACHANDANI	Not a good idea.
M	RANDY	What if I do it moderate? I could hold back on certain moves. There's always ways to fake----
M	DR. TARACHANDANI	Mr. Ramovic...
M	RANDY	Randy.
M	DR. TARACHANDANI	Randy, a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people.
M	RANDY	With all due respect, Dr... ...Trachanani, I'd like a second opinion on that.
M	DR. TARACHANDANI	Of course. But I promise you, any doctor I showed your file would say the same thing.
M	DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)	You almost died. The next time, you won't be so lucky.
M	RANDY	I want a second opinion.
M	DR. TARACHANDANI	Your heart's been through a lot. Even before the heart attack, it was significantly----

F	CASSIDY	I know the perfect place. This kick- ass little vintage shop in Westfield.

F	CASSIDY	Oh-kaay...
M	RANDY	So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam?
F	CASSIDY	Pam. But don't get used to it.
M	RANDY	This is awesome... We are gonna find something great!
F	CASSIDY	Do you know her size?
M	RANDY	She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you.
F	CASSIDY	Could you see her in this?
M	RANDY	Maybe. Not really. I'm not sure.
F	CASSIDY	What about this?
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	So like, what is she? Goth? Punk? Hippie? Preppy? Stoner?
M	RANDY	Not really...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Hey, Pam?
F	CASSIDY	Yeah?
M	RANDY	Thank you very much.
F	CASSIDY	You're welcome.
M	RANDY	I think she might be a lesbian.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Does that help?
M	RANDY	Ah, maybe she's just a friend.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	What's that? The green.
F	CASSIDY	This?
M	RANDY	It's perfect.

F	CASSIDY	I gotta get going.
M	RANDY	One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
F	CASSIDY	I really can't. I got a kid at home.
M	RANDY	You have a kid?
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	I had no idea.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Boy or girl?
F	CASSIDY	Boy. Daniel.
M	RANDY	How old?
F	CASSIDY	Nine.
M	RANDY	Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
F	CASSIDY	It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
M	RANDY	Wait.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Now both our kids got something.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	You're gonna turn this down, too? Man, you're rough!
F	CASSIDY	That's very nice of you. Thank you.

M	RANDY	Nah.
F	CASSIDY	One beer.
M	RANDY	He's a good-lookin' kid.
F	CASSIDY	I think so.
M	RANDY	I see where he gets it from.
F	CASSIDY	He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father.
M	RANDY	What's that?
F	CASSIDY	Just this condo thing, down by Trenton.
M	RANDY	You moving there?
F	CASSIDY	Working on it. It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome.
M	RANDY	What about Cheetah's?
F	CASSIDY	I'm done. I'm quitting.

M	RANDY (CONT'D)	The lapdancer has become the lapdanced.
F	CASSIDY	I think we can get you a shift.
M	RANDY	Take a bottle, shake it up/ Break the bubble, break it u-up... Pour some sugar on me! In the name of love!
M	CASSIDY AND RANDY	Pour some sugar on me! C'mon fire me up! Pour your sugar on me! I can't get enough... I'm hot, sticky sweet/ From my head to my feet yeah...

M	RANDY	Fuckin' mopey douchebag. "Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel! I'm all depressed!"
F	CASSIDY	"I'm from Seattle! I like rain!"
M	RANDY	Nineties fuckin' sucked.
F	CASSIDY	No shit...

M	WOMAN	The Hudson Acres, are they all on sale or just the regular?
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	It's a little unclear.
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if it's full price...
M	RANDY	Hang on, let me...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Wayne, please come to the deli counter.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	It'll just be a minute.
M	WOMAN	Which in your opinion is the best smoked ham?

M	RANDY	Forty-six.
M	WORKOUT WOMAN	Could I get a half-pound of the pesto pasta salad?

F	STEPHANIE	What are you, stalking me?
M	RANDY	Do stalkers bring presents?
F	STEPHANIE	Sometimes.
M	RANDY	Well, I ain't a stalker. But...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Open it.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	The "S" is for "Stephanie".
F	STEPHANIE	Oh. Okay.
M	RANDY	I got it just for you.
F	STEPHANIE	I see that. What's it for?
M	RANDY	No reason. Just because. Do you like it?
F	STEPHANIE	I do. It's... shiny.
M	RANDY	I was looking in this store and saw it, and I just said, "That is it." So what are you doing now?
F	STEPHANIE	What am I doing?
M	RANDY	Got any time? I was thinking we could swing by our old favorite spot.
F	STEPHANIE	We have an old favorite spot?
M	RANDY	You'll remember when you see. Whaddaya say?
F	STEPHANIE	Now's not the best time. I've got some things to do.
M	RANDY	What kinda things?
F	STEPHANIE	Stuff.
M	RANDY	You ain't got stuff! C'mon, give an old man a break.
M	RANDY	You really don't remember?
F	STEPHANIE	No.
M	RANDY	Guess you were pretty young.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	There used to be this funhouse. The Monster Motel...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	They had this cheesy-ass skeleton that popped out of a coffin. You'd get so scared, you'd cry. Then you'd beg to go in again.
F	STEPHANIE	Always was a glutton for punishment.
M	RANDY	You'd hop on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg. I'd have to walk you the whole way through like that.
F	STEPHANIE	I totally don't remember.
M	RANDY	I do.
M	RANDY	I accept your apology.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Not like that. I just mean... You made amends. I free you.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Anything you've ever done or said or thought, I forgive. You've done nothing wrong to me. And anything I've ever done... I'm sorry. Truly.
F	STEPHANIE	Thank you.
M	RANDY	I was young. My career was booming. All those lights, the fans, the crazy shit on the road... I wasn't thinking about my kid. Or my wife.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	My priorities were all fucked up. I know that. But now... I wanna try to make things right. I wanna try to get to know you. I just hope it's not too late.
M	RANDY	Hope that wasn't too painful.
F	STEPHANIE	It was okay.
M	RANDY	Well...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Bye.
F	STEPHANIE	Bye.
M	RANDY	So... How about dinner sometime?
F	STEPHANIE	Dinner?
M	RANDY	Maybe Tuesday?
F	STEPHANIE	I'm sorry. I don't think so.
M	RANDY	Or not. That's cool, whatever...
F	STEPHANIE	Wednesday would work better.
M	RANDY	Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'? Good, good. Listen, you're gonna have to count me out for Utica. I'm retiring.
M	RANDY	Hey, how ya doin', Frank? Good, good. Listen...
M	RANDY	Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to do it. I realize. I understand. No more. I'm done. I'm retired. Positive. It's time to move on.

F	CASSIDY	I'll do it later when it's quiet.
M	RANDY	I wanna watch.
F	CASSIDY	That's very sweet. Thank you.
M	RANDY	Thank you. I couldn't've done it without you.
F	CASSIDY	I'm glad I could help.
M	RANDY	It was fun, right? We had a good time.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Shopping...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Hey, you ever been to Mother Kelly's?
F	CASSIDY	On 46?
M	RANDY	They got this kick-ass cover band Tuesday nights. Play anything you can think of. What do you say we----
F	CASSIDY	Randy.
M	RANDY	What?
F	CASSIDY	I can't do this.
M	RANDY	Do what?
F	CASSIDY	This.
M	RANDY	I thought we had a little something going here.
F	CASSIDY	I think you're awesome. You're a great guy.
M	RANDY	But...
F	CASSIDY	You think I'm, like, this stripper, but I'm not. I'm a mom, with responsibilities. I don't think you wanna get with that.
M	RANDY	What if I do?
F	CASSIDY	I can't go there.
M	RANDY	What about the other day?
F	CASSIDY	That was a mistake.
M	RANDY	Why? How?
F	CASSIDY	The club and the real world, they can't mix.
M	RANDY	What if we'd met someplace else?
F	CASSIDY	We didn't.
M	RANDY	But what if we did?
F	CASSIDY	We didn't.
M	RANDY	What if we did?
F	CASSIDY	We didn't.
M	RANDY	You say I don't know you, but you won't let me get to know you.
F	CASSIDY	You're a customer. You're just a fucking customer. That's it. Okay? Got it?
M	RANDY	Yeah. I got it.
F	CASSIDY	What's that for?
M	RANDY	A lapdance.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	You're refusing a customer?
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Gimme a lapdance.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	What? Am I a customer or not?
F	CASSIDY	Stop it.
M	RANDY	What's the matter? Not in the mood? So fake it. I'm just a stupid customer.
F	CASSIDY	Stop.
M	RANDY	It doesn't mean anything.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	C'mon, give the customer a lapdance. Shake your tits. Smile.
F	CASSIDY	Fuck off.
M	RANDY	Pretend you like him.

M	SCOTT BRUMBERG	See what we got...
M	BOOKER D (O.S.)	Randy The Ref!
M	RANDY	`Sup, bro?
M	BOOKER D	Me and McPride was going over spots. We got this dope idea how to work you in.
M	RANDY	I really ain't lookin' to mix it up tonight.
M	BOOKER D	You're gonna love this. Check it out. So McPride----
M	RANDY	That's okay. You guys do your thing.
M	RANDY	One!... Two!...

M	SHAWN MCPRIDE	Crowd was pissed.
M	SHAWN MCPRIDE (CONT'D)	The master.
M	BOOKER D	Just reffing, my ass. I knew you'd get in there.
M	SHAWN MCPRIDE	Y'all feel like grabbing a drink?
M	RANDY	By the time Ruckus fixes the tire, we've had so many Nyquil coladas we don't even realize we missed the damn gig!
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Swear to God. Can't make stuff like that up.
M	BOOKER D	Yo, tell McPride shit-pit!
M	SHAWN MCPRIDE	Shit pit?
M	RANDY	You never heard that one?
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Oh, man, fuckin' classic. 1990. Nashville Coliseum, Rage In The Cage II. I'm in the locker room door opens. I turn and there's Chris Columbo on the can taking a dump. He goes, "This is for Petrov", fuckin' wipes his ass, takes the shit-covered toilet paper and rubs it in his armpit. Five minutes later, he's in the ring with Petrov in a headlock, poor Petrov stuck there in CC's pit lookin' like he's gonna puke!
M	BOOKER D	Fuckin' classic. Uh-oh...
M	BOOKER D (CONT'D)	Ring rats, 12 o'clock.

F	STEPHANIE	Please leave my house.
M	RANDY	I'm so, so sorry. I completely, TOTALLY----
M	THE FRIEND	Get the fuck out of here!

M	STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	You're such a fucking asshole.
M	RANDY	I feel horrible.
F	STEPHANIE	I waited in that restaurant two hours. Two fucking hours. Just in case you showed up late. "Maybe he got stuck in traffic. Maybe I got the time wrong"... Nope.
M	RANDY	I know I fucked up. I fucked up bad.
F	STEPHANIE	You didn't fuck up. You are a fuck- up. A walking, living, breathing fuck-up.
M	RANDY	I'm trying to change. Really. I can't stand when I----
F	STEPHANIE	Just please shut the fuck up. Because I can't even stand the sound of your voice.
M	STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	I thought about having a drink for the first time in 11 months last night. That's what you do to me. You asshole!
M	STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	Fucking piece-of-shit asshole!
M	RANDY	Jesus! Stop!
F	STEPHANIE	Get off me!
M	RANDY	Calm down!
F	STEPHANIE	GET THE FUCK OFF ME!
M	RANDY	Calm down!
F	STEPHANIE	I HATE YOU!
M	RANDY	You don't mean that!
F	STEPHANIE	FUCKING HATE YOU!
M	RANDY	YOU DON'T MEAN IT!
F	STEPHANIE	I don't mean it? You're right. I don't.
M	STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	I don't know why I got so hysterical. There's no reason. I don't hate you. I don't love you. I don't like you. I was stupid to think you could change.
M	RANDY	I can change.
F	STEPHANIE	I don't care.
M	RANDY	I know I can.
F	STEPHANIE	Doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm done. No more fixing it. It's broke. Permanently. I'm cool with it. It's better that way.
M	STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	I don't want to ever see you again. I don't wanna see you, I don't want to hear you... Done. You understand? Actually, I don't care if you understand.

F	CASSIDY	Big Chris. Cheetah's bouncer.
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Look, I'm sorry if I came off like a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I said. You're not just a customer.
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm sure it seems retarded, but I gotta keep that line. It's how I've been able to live with myself the last 12 years.
F	CASSIDY	There's a place I'm trying to get to in my life. For me and my son.
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm leaving that world behind. And I can't bring anybody with me who----
M	RANDY	Good for you. Quitting's hard.

F	CASSIDY	There's waffles in the freezer and some burritos if he wants for lunch. He knows where. I'm not sure what time I'll be headed back yet. I'll keep you posted as I go.
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Yeah, nah, business is rockin'. Just opened a third dealership.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	That makes two in Columbus, one in Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say Cincy's not out of the question.
M	OTHER WRESTLER	Wow...
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Ram-A-Lam.
M	RANDY	What's up, Bob? Yo, Carl.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think we were gonna do this.
M	RANDY	Yeah, well, I'm here.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Thursday night, I get a call, "It's on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?"
M	RANDY	When you get settled in, we should go over things.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	What things?
M	RANDY	Y'know, the spots.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Ah, we can just wing it.
M	RANDY	You don't wanna hash it out?
M	THE AYATOLLAH	It'll be fine.
M	RANDY	We should have at least a basic plan.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	How's this: I'm the heel, you're the face. Done.
M	THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio, swing on by. I'll make you a nice deal on a G6.
F	CASSIDY	Excuse me.
M	CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is?
M	RANDY	Ready to do this?
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Believe so.
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	From the Islamic Republic of Iran, weighing in at 252 pounds... The Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The Middle East... The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!
F	CASSIDY	Excuse me.
M	THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)	Death to America!
M	CASSIDY (O.S.)	Randy.
M	RANDY	What are you doing here?
F	CASSIDY	Don't do this. This is dumb.
M	RANDY	This ain't the best time to talk.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	What about your heart?
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	I'll be fine.
F	CASSIDY	I thought the doctor...
M	RANDY	They always say that. Whatever you got.
F	CASSIDY	You could really hurt yourself. I know what I'm doing in there. Out here's where I get hurt.
F	CASSIDY	Out here's what counts. The real world.
M	RANDY	Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a shit about me in the real world.
F	CASSIDY	I quit my job, drove 14 hours through the night to get here. What do you call that?
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	And his opponent...
M	RANDY	Listen to them! This is where I'm great. This is where I belong.
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	From Elizabeth, New Jersey, weighing in at 219 pounds...
M	RANDY	I gotta go.
F	CASSIDY	Randy. Please.
M	RANDY	I'll see you after the show.

M	RANDY	Enjoy the show.
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	A true wrestling immortal, one of the greatest of all time... Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn!
M	COMMENTATOR #1	There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!
M	COMMENTATOR #2	History about to be made here at the Greenville Civic Auditorium.
M	RANDY	I just got one thing to say to you people...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Thank you.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	You take your lumps and bruises in this game. But you know what? It's all worth it. Because of you guys. Your cheers keep me young. They make me feel alive. In 1982, the year I wrestled my first professional match, I was six- foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot- eleven. Three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. I may be down to five- eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. And that's the way it's always gonna be.
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	Forever. You're workin' pretty light here.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Jesus. Relax.
M	REFEREE	One!... Two!...
M	RANDY	Anytime you wanna join in.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	That better?
M	RANDY	Much.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Forgot how much fun this is.
M	REFEREE	One!... Two!...
M	FAN #1 (O.S.) FAN #2 (O.S.)	Camelfucker! Fat piece of shit!
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Pathetic. Pitiful godless infidel!
F	CASSIDY	Randy!
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Wanna take it home?
F	CASSIDY	Stop it! Stop it, Randy!
M	RANDY	It's time.
M	THE AYATOLLAH	All you, bro. Lead the way.
M	COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)	Dropkick! And another! And another! Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!... Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
M	COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)	Just listen to this crowd!
M	THE AYATOLLAH	If you ain't up to it... Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
M	RANDY	Let's do this.
M	COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)	Lateral drop!
M	CROWD (O.S.)	Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
M	THE AYATOLLAH	Y'okay?
M	THE AYATOLLAH (CONT'D)	Just pin me.
