M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MORELL	What kind is it?
M	VANGER O/S	I don't know. White.
M	MORELL	And the frame?
M	VANGER O/S	Dark.
M	MORELL	Postmark?
M	VANGER O/S	Same as last time.
M	MORELL	No note.
M	VANGER O/S	No. VANGER I can't take it anymore.
M	MORELL O/S	I know. I'm sorry, Henrik.
F	BLOMKVIST	What is this, the media event of the year? REPORTER 1 Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work.
F	BLOMKVIST	Don't try to play it up, that won't either.
M	REPORTER 2	Will you appeal? BLOMKVIST I'll appeal to you, Viggo: Find a real story to cover. He hurries off in the rain.
M	NEWSCASTER V/O	Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel against financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
M	TV NEWSCASTER	In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia.
M	WENNERSTROM ON TV	I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a good journalist who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go unanswered. He - all journalists - have to accept like the rest of us, actions have consequences.
F	BLOMKVIST	Marlboro Red ... and a lighter.
M	TV NEWSCASTER V/O	Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more.
F	ERIKA	Where you been?
F	BLOMKVIST	Walking. Thinking.
F	ERIKA	Smoking?
F	BLOMKVIST	Just one. sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
F	ERIKA	TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
F	BLOMKVIST	I have. Who else? ERIKA Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated.
F	BLOMKVIST	You've been on the phone all day then.
F	ERIKA	I'm as much to blame for this as you.
F	BLOMKVIST	You are? You wrote it?
F	ERIKA	I read it. I ran it.
F	BLOMKVIST	Not the same. ERIKA Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.
F	BLOMKVIST	Mine is. regard each other in another silence. Then -
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm tired. I feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a week. ERIKA Alone? He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'
F	ERIKA	I already called Greger and told him I wouldn't be home tonight.
M	ARMANSKY	It's possible we could wait forever.
M	FRODE	You called her, I thought. You spoke to her. ARMANSKY I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
M	FRODE	I don't understand.
M	ARMANSKY	No one here likes her. So it's better if she works at home. FRODE But you told her I wanted to meet her.
M	ARMANSKY	But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients.
M	FRODE V/O	But you like her. ARMANSKY V/O Very much. She's one of the best investigators I have. As you saw from her report - FRODE But.
M	ARMANSKY	I'm concerned you won't like her. She's different. FRODE In what way.
M	ARMANSKY	In every way. Ms. Salander's here.
M	ARMANSKY	Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode. FRODE How do you do?
F	SALANDER	Something wrong with the report? FRODE No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it.
F	SALANDER	There's nothing not in it.
M	FRODE	Your opinion of him isn't.
F	SALANDER	I'm not paid to give my opinion.
M	FRODE	So you don't have one?
F	SALANDER	He's clean. In my opinion.
M	FRODE	He's - excuse me?
F	SALANDER	He's honest. He's who he presents himself to be. In his business, that's an asset.
M	FRODE	There's less in his asset column after his conviction today. SALANDER That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way. looks at Armansky. What's that supposed to mean?
F	SALANDER	If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character.
M	FRODE	Are you saying he was set up?
F	SALANDER	That wasn't part of my assignment.
M	FRODE	You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally. How big of a fool did he make of himself financially?
F	SALANDER	The judgement will just about empty his savings. seems to please Frode more than anything else that SALANDER May I go?
M	FRODE	Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to include? SALANDER Nothing that warranted inclusion.
M	FRODE	I'm not sure if that means yes or no.
M	ARMANSKY	I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated.
M	FRODE	Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.
F	SALANDER	He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.
M	FRODE	You were right not to include that.
F	SALANDER	I know. FRODE Anything else? SALANDER No.
M	FRODE	Please think before you say no. SALANDER I did. FRODE I don't want to be surprised by something later.
M	FRODE	So. Nothing else. In the personal department. You're sure.
F	SALANDER	He likes sandwiches.
F	ERIKA	Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home.
F	BLOMKVIST	Sorry.
F	ERIKA	What are you doing?
F	BLOMKVIST	Writing the press release.
F	ERIKA	Saying - BLOMKVIST You're taking over as publisher. You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be reached for comment.
F	ERIKA	You're giving up. BLOMKVIST Just taking a few steps aside. For you. ERIKA This makes me sick. The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
M	GREGER	You needed a better attorney. You needed your sister. BLOMKVIST She offered.
F	ANNIKA	He declined.
F	BLOMKVIST	As she hoped. ANNIKA Never a good idea mixing family and business.
F	BLOMKVIST	And I still would have lost.
M	GREGOR	Did you have ... anything on him.
F	BLOMKVIST	I had a lot. It just wasn't any good.
F	ERIKA	It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to worry about me.
M	PERNILLA	Mom's worried. BLOMKVIST About me?
M	PERNILLA	About all that money.
M	DOCTOR	You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter? SALANDER His ward. He doesn't have a daughter.
F	SALANDER	Please.
M	DOCTOR V/O	He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Either from the fall itself, or a stroke that led to the fall. His blood pressure is still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured. And it's possible, if he does, there will be neurological damage.
F	BLOMKVIST	Nilla? What are you doing? PERNILLA Nothing.
F	BLOMKVIST	You're not serious. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
M	PERNILLA	I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve.
F	BLOMKVIST	Of - Nilla. PERNILLA Light of Life.
F	BLOMKVIST	Light of - what? What is that?
M	PERNILLA	You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to. never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out. BLOMKVIST Excuse me. back at his daughter with some concern, he steps
F	BLOMKVIST	Hello. FRODE O/S Mr. Blomkvist?
F	BLOMKVIST	Yes.
M	FRODE O/S	Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode. I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of
F	BLOMKVIST	Of course. FRODE O/S He'd like to speak to you about a private matter.
F	BLOMKVIST	You know, you're calling at an awkward time.
M	FRODE O/S	I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to Christmas dinner myself. BLOMKVIST That's not what I mean.
M	FRODE O/S	You're referring to your recent legal trouble. That has provided Mr. Vanger with some entertainment. BLOMKVIST Excuse me?
M	FRODE O/S	He doesn't care for Wennerstrom either.
F	BLOMKVIST	Have him call me. FRODE O/S He'd like to meet in person if that's okay. Up north. Hedestad.
F	BLOMKVIST	No. Sorry.
M	FRODE O/S	He's much too old to make a trip to Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist. Please. If you'd be so kind as to consider.
M	FRODE O/S	Hedestad is lovely in winter. Like a Christmas card. FRODE First time in Hedestad?
F	BLOMKVIST	And last, I'm sure. FRODE It's lovely in the spring.
F	BLOMKVIST	You said it was lovely in winter.
M	FRODE	This is unseasonable.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
M	FRODE	Unless we get snowed in ... I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
F	VANGER	Welcome. Come inside. It's warm. VANGER Thank you for coming way out here. Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat. Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like?
M	FRODE	Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
F	VANGER	What?
F	BLOMKVIST	I can't stay for dinner.
F	VANGER	Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way.
F	VANGER	What do you know about me? BLOMKVIST That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country.
F	VANGER	Used to. That's correct.
F	VANGER	My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines. We stitched this country together. We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden. You know what our most profitable product now is? Fertilizer.
F	VANGER	I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts - and the clock is ticking. I need your help.
F	BLOMKVIST	Doing.
F	VANGER	Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet ... my family. President of the investment firm, Wennerstrom-gruppen ... Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached' Hmmm.
M	VANGER V/O	This is Harriet. The granddaughter of my brother Richard.
F	VANGER	Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17.
F	VANGER	Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried.
F	VANGER	Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie.
F	BLOMKVIST	They're still called that.
F	VANGER	Are they? Okay. Close on a photo of Gottfried.
F	VANGER	He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on.
F	BLOMKVIST	Someone has to do it. VANGER That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.
F	VANGER	His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet.
F	VANGER	She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person. BLOMKVIST And beautiful. Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...
F	BLOMKVIST	Something happened to her?
F	VANGER	Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane.
F	VANGER	It was September 21st, 1966. A Saturday. Harriet was 16.
M	VANGER V/O	My brothers - along with their wives, children and grandchildren - had gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the Yacht Club held its Autumn parade.
M	VANGER V/O	Harriet and a couple of school friends had gone into town to watch it. She returned a little after two o'clock.
M	VANGER V/O	She came to the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. She leaves. He returns to the others in the room.
M	VANGER V/O	But in a few minutes, before I could go upstairs to talk to her, something else occurred. VANGER V/O The accident had nothing to do with Harriet - and everything.
M	VANGER V/O	It was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing.
M	VANGER V/O	Police, an ambulance, fire brigade, reporter, photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town, as those of us on the island - the family - hurried to the bridge from our side.
M	VANGER V/O	The driver of the car - a Mr. Aronsson - was pinned and severely injured. All we could do was try to pry him out with our hands - since metal tools could spark.
M	VANGER V/O	About twenty minutes after the crash, Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. We finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital, and those of us on our side drifted back to the house.
M	VANGER V/O	The sun was down, the excitement over, we sat down to dinner. That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.
M	VANGER V/O	And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next forty years.
F	VANGER	What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen?
F	BLOMKVIST	She couldn't have run away?
F	VANGER	Not without being seen.
F	VANGER	Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we checked.
F	BLOMKVIST	She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
F	VANGER	The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before. Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his
F	VANGER	No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to
F	VANGER	These were from her.
F	VANGER	These, from her killer. Blomkvist regards the forty ...
F	BLOMKVIST	Who knows about these?
F	VANGER	Me, the police, the murderer ... and now you. It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before
M	VANGER V/O	When the police investigation petered out, I kept at it -
F	VANGER	- studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.
F	BLOMKVIST	I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money. VANGER We haven't discussed your fee. BLOMKVIST We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.
F	VANGER	You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind. Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't.
F	BLOMKVIST	You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.
F	VANGER	Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
F	BLOMKVIST	
F	VANGER	I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
F	VANGER	He began his career working for me. And I've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it.
M	PLAGUE	Would you like to sit? I could possibly clear a place if necessary. SALANDER Did you make it? PLAGUE Have you something for me?
M	PLAGUE	I'm on welfare; I don't administer it. This isn't enough.
F	SALANDER	I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit. It's all I have right now.
M	PLAGUE	I find that so poignant. So much so that he does nothing more than look at her.
M	PLAGUE	No `thank you?' ERIKA V/O You can't be serious -
F	ERIKA	We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir? BLOMKVIST You fired me; I need something to do.
F	ERIKA	You fired you; I need you here, not the North Pole. You know what this is going to look like.
F	BLOMKVIST	Like I've been gutted. Like I'm running away. I am. They cross through the building, he with his cases, she Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him.
F	ERIKA	There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone. BLOMKVIST It's four hours by train. It's not the North Pole. BLOMKVIST Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon?
M	HUSSEIN	This is the North Pole. Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
F	BLOMKVIST	What. Milk?
F	BLOMKVIST	It's me. I'm here. It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold.
M	NILSSON	I'm Gunner. The caretaker.
M	NILSSON	You're an author.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm writing a biography of Mr. Vanger, yes.
M	NILSSON	I saw you on television.
F	BLOMKVIST	That's unfortunate.
M	NILSSON	Bit of trouble, I guess.
M	NILSSON	No jail time, though. That's good. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
M	NILSSON	There.
F	VANGER	The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse.
F	BLOMKVIST	He was there that day?
F	VANGER	Indeed he was.
F	VANGER	That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak.
F	BLOMKVIST	Does anyone speak to anyone on this island?
F	VANGER	Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. Cecilia's brother Birger lives there. BLOMKVIST Who doesn't he speak to?
F	VANGER	You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm quickly losing track who's who.
F	VANGER	Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother.
F	BLOMKVIST	Who speaks to him?
F	VANGER	I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you.
F	VANGER	Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker. BLOMKVIST I just met him. VANGER He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. He lives over there. And you live here.
F	VANGER	Sorry? BLOMKVIST Your house.
F	VANGER	Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.
F	SALANDER	I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian. He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins
M	MORELL	I'd like to see the girl's room.
F	VANGER	It's down the hall.
M	MORELL	I thought this was your house.
F	VANGER	It is. She lives with me.
M	MORELL	Are her parents alive?
F	VANGER	Her mother is. VANGER This way. Morell follows Vanger down a hall - DET. MORELL I want to speak to everyone here. That'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on.
M	YOUNGER VANGER	What about the search?
M	MORELL	First thing in the morning. YOUNGER VANGER No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there.
F	VANGER	Please. I beg you. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat
M	MORELL V/O	We searched for days ... Eventually, much to his dismay - and mine - I had to talk to Henrik about calling it off -
M	MORELL V/O	The fact that I never found a body didn't surprise me. You can't dig up an entire island.
M	MORELL	But I also couldn't find a motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it planned? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business? BLOMKVIST Business? She was sixteen.
M	MORELL	And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't.
F	BLOMKVIST	She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to them.
M	MORELL	She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.
F	BLOMKVIST	I have one.
M	MORELL	So you know. Did you bring the last gift Henrik received?
F	BLOMKVIST	It's at the National Forensic Lab.
M	MORELL	I can tell you what their report will say now: It's a flower common to Europe. All of them are. No prints. No DNA. lights the pipe. Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.
F	BLOMKVIST	I wanted to ask you about this. The decades have dried out its pages. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
M	MORELL	She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. BLOMKVIST It's the last page I'm curious about. MORELL As was I.
F	BLOMKVIST	The only names not alphabetized. nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
M	MORELL	They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. hands the address book back. It, and everything else
F	BLOMKVIST	I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry.
M	MORELL	I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case.
M	MORELL	Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh. BLOMKVIST Was this also a missing girl case?
M	MORELL	No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.
M	BJURMAN	How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was told he had a stroke of some kind. Terrible. BJURMAN What exactly do you do at this security company?
F	SALANDER	Make coffee and sort mail.
M	BJURMAN	But not full-time. Not even part- time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August? BJURMAN How much do you earn there?
F	SALANDER	Enough.
M	BJURMAN	How much is your rent? Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
F	SALANDER	I pay my rent.
M	BJURMAN	When's the last time you were late? SALANDER Never. BJURMAN Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive?
M	BJURMAN	Here's the problem. There a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances.
F	SALANDER	It isn't a discrepancy or a problem. It was clear to him I could manage my own finances. BJURMAN But that's not clear to me.
F	SALANDER	I'm not a child.
M	BJURMAN	No. You're not. But you were. And between then and now - - two years in the locked ward at St. Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face. You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this - - not to mention how you're looking at me now - I can see you haven't. So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over. Starting now, you'll be given a monthly allowance. You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.
M	BJURMAN (CONT'D)	If the numbers don't balance, I'll have to assume the difference is going to drugs.
F	SALANDER	I've been on my own since I was twelve.
M	BJURMAN	No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
M	BJURMAN (CONT'D)	Ms. Salander? Please look at me. Because this is important. She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.
M	BJURMAN	This behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here - - so it would come as a shock to no one if I chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement I just outlined. Is that what you're saying with your silence? You'd prefer institutionalization?
F	LIV	Mikael? We're going to the same place. Hop in.
F	LIV	I found him at death's door halfway up the hill.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
M	MARTIN	No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in. LIV I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it. MARTIN A dark day.
F	LIV	I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin. MARTIN She comes for the moose steak.
F	BLOMKVIST	Is that what this is? MARTIN Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else?
F	BLOMKVIST	That one's good.
F	LIV	I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
F	BLOMKVIST	That was a dark day.
F	LIV	Sorry to remind you of it. BLOMKVIST It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business.
F	LIV	You're writing a book now, Martin said. BLOMKVIST Henrik's biography.
F	LIV	I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New.
F	BLOMKVIST	They are.
F	LIV	You know about Harriet, right?
F	LIV	You don't?
F	BLOMKVIST	I do.
M	LIV O/S	The family doesn't like to talk about it, but it can't just be swept under the rug.
M	MARTIN	What can't.
F	LIV	Harriet. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
F	BLOMKVIST	Maybe we could talk about that later.
M	MARTIN	We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me.
F	LIV	That's one reason. MARTIN Don't put that in your book. Anything else is fine. Harriet certainly. Everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company.
F	BLOMKVIST	How so.
M	MARTIN	We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart.
F	BLOMKVIST	You were here that day?
M	MARTIN	Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 4:30 train.
F	BLOMKVIST	I know it well.
M	MARTIN	It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse. Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.
M	MARTIN	This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book. She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
F	CECILIA	Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia. INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager,
F	CECILIA	We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.
F	BLOMKVIST	It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company.
F	CECILIA	Like I said.
F	BLOMKVIST	It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.
F	CECILIA	Unlike the one that landed you in court. BLOMKVIST Unlike that one. Correct.
F	CECILIA	So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet.
F	BLOMKVIST	I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus.
F	CECILIA	So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform
F	BLOMKVIST	Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like?
F	CECILIA	I'm sure Henrik has told you. BLOMKVIST He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age.
F	CECILIA	Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.
F	CECILIA	She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did. You should talk to her.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'd love to, where is she. CECILIA If I had to guess - London. BLOMKVIST You don't know where your own sister lives?
F	CECILIA	I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm getting used to that comment.
F	CECILIA	That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.
F	BLOMKVIST	People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.
F	CECILIA	Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. BLOMKVIST I'll try to track her down for you.
F	CECILIA	Don't bother. BLOMKVIST For myself then.
F	CECILIA	If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off.
M	TECH	You backed up?
F	SALANDER	Hard drives at home, yeah.
M	TECH	That's good. This one's dead.
M	SECRETARY V/O	I'm sorry, he's booked all day.

M	SECRETARY V/O	Hold, please. Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they

F	SALANDER	I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before.
M	BJURMAN	And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that? Shall we start with me? Shall we start now?
M	BJURMAN	If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. That's how normal people are.
M	BJURMAN	You've done this before. You know what to do. Do you want this computer or not?
M	BJURMAN	You feel that? That's gaberdine. Unzip them. And ... And ... I like the reticence. I prefer a whore who pretends she isn't. It's almost convincing. He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him. BJURMAN Here you go. As promised.
M	BJURMAN	I know you're not thinking about telling anyone about our date. Enjoy your computer games. She takes the check and leaves.
F	BLOMKVIST	Excuse me. I'm sure I should have made an appointment.
F	ANITA	It's fine. Please. Have a seat.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm Mikael.
F	ANITA	Mikael. How do you do.
F	ANITA	You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael? BLOMKVIST I would if had any money to invest.
F	ANITA	Excuse me?
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia
F	ANITA	How is Henrik?
F	BLOMKVIST	Good. Engaging. I like him. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
F	ANITA	haven't seen him in over 30 years. my sister. Or anyone else in my BLOMKVIST of what I'm writing about that, so your recollections valid.
F	ANITA	wouldn't know where to start, if was a question.
F	BLOMKVIST	can narrow it. I've gotten up to 1960s. To the event that altered in Henrik's life. ANITA I knew about that I told - whatever his name was - that - when it happened. BLOMKVIST
F	ANITA	recollections then were a lot than they are now.

F	ANITA	BLOMKVIST
F	ANITA	I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy.
F	BLOMKVIST	She never confided in you what about, specifically? ANITA There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it.
F	BLOMKVIST	What do you think happened to her?
F	ANITA	Everyone knows what. BLOMKVIST But you have no ... thoughts about why, or who. ANITA All I know is I always felt sorry for her. Even more than for myself. I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back. She would have done the same but didn't make it to 18.
F	SALANDER	Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth Salander. ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment. I had a lot of work ... no, nothing to be concerned about ... I need another advance on my allowance. Can I come to your office tonight? ... I don't need a pen, what's the address?
M	BJURMAN O/S	Yes?
F	SALANDER	It's me.
M	BJURMAN	Come on in.
M	BJURMAN	Like it?
F	SALANDER	It's nice.
M	BJURMAN	It's home. So, what do you need money for this time? Grand Theft Auto 5?
F	SALANDER	Food. He smiles. Steps toward her. Lifts her chin.
M	BJURMAN	How are you? Been thinking about last time? Decided you wanted to see me again?
F	SALANDER	I just want my money.
M	BJURMAN	Well, let's see if I can help you out with that.
F	SALANDER	Wait.
M	BJURMAN	Is there a problem?
F	SALANDER	I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat? BJURMAN It's so cute when you do that surly thing. Take my hand She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's

M	BJURMAN	I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex?

M	BJURMAN	I'll drive you home.
F	SALANDER	I can get home on my own.
M	BJURMAN	Are you sure?
M	BJURMAN	So, next Saturday, here?
F	ERIKA	Is it any warmer inside? BLOMKVIST No. BLOMKVIST What have I missed besides you? ERIKA The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers.
F	BLOMKVIST	Seriously?
F	ERIKA	Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat?
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm not. I'm working.
F	ERIKA	I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the
F	BLOMKVIST	Would you like to meet him?
F	ERIKA	Maybe in about an hour. If you're interested.
F	VANGER	I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence. ERIKA We'll work through them.
F	VANGER	Are you sure?
M	MARTIN	How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so? ERIKA That sounds about right.
F	VANGER	You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's.
M	MARTIN	We still own one. The Courier, here in town.
F	VANGER	I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. So what do you say to taking on a partner?
F	ERIKA	We've never considered it before. We value our independence. Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content.
F	BLOMKVIST	Excuse me. Did I miss something?
F	VANGER	We're talking about an investment in the magazine. BLOMKVIST I gather. Why would you want to do that?
M	MARTIN	Not for the return, that's for sure.
F	VANGER	I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason.
F	ERIKA	And. VANGER The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you.
F	VANGER	So what do you say? Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.
F	VANGER	Is that a maybe? She nods.
F	VANGER	Wonderful! More wine, Anna.
F	VANGER	I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way. ERIKA Have you seen him try to make a fire?
F	VANGER	Put the logs on end, like this. How long have you been discussing this with them?
F	ERIKA	I haven't been. They asked me to come up yesterday.
F	BLOMKVIST	Why didn't you tell me?
F	ERIKA	Why would I. You live in the woods. BLOMKVIST So I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
F	ERIKA	I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. BLOMKVIST I'm saying it now. It's not a good idea.
F	ERIKA	You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three. BLOMKVIST You don't know this family. They're crazy.
F	ERIKA	We're not marrying into it.
F	BLOMKVIST	We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing.
F	ERIKA	You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing. ERIKA O/S Mikael?
F	BLOMKVIST	What.
M	ERIKA O/S	I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning. BLOMKVIST So?
F	ERIKA	So are you coming to bed or not.
M	TATTOO ARTIST	You thinking one arm or both?
F	SALANDER	Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like handcuffs. It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt.
F	SALANDER	How much do one of those cost? ANNOUNCER Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries has acquired a controlling interest in Millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last December when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
F	ERIKA	We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it. But we're moving forward, and this is the first step.
M	REPORTER 2	You wouldn't say the first step was your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?
F	ERIKA	That's inaccurate. Read the original press release, Viggo. I didn't fire him. He's on sabbatical. REPORTER 2 Where.
F	ERIKA	I'm not sure, to be honest with you.
M	MARTIN	Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us.
M	REPORTER 3	Is any magazine really undervalued today. How many will be around tomorrow?
F	VANGER	There's another reason. I don't like bullies. Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom? VANGER I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission. If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back. You're enjoying this.
F	VANGER	Already it's the most fun I've had in years.
M	WENNERSTROM ON TV	I've always admired Henrik Vanger. He's a titan - and a gentleman. But he's also quite old now - which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar. The From box reads: h wennerstrom <HEW@WG.com> It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over.
F	BLOMKVIST	I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade.
M	VANGER V/O	You already have what it has. In the album.
F	BLOMKVIST	I don't think so.
M	VANGER V/O	Why. BLOMKVIST Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything - especially after having to climb a flight of stairs.
M	VANGER V/O	The bridge accident happened during the parade. He rushed over.
F	BLOMKVIST	Maybe.
M	VANGER V/O	Mikael, what have you found?
F	BLOMKVIST	Nothing probably. But I know photographers. They're the most insecure people on earth. If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it.
M	PHOTO EDITOR	The current archive is on CD's, naturally. The older stuff, still negatives. What general period are you interested in?
F	BLOMKVIST	September, 1966.
F	BLOMKVIST	Thank you.
M	PHOTO EDITOR	Is this about Harriet Vanger? BLOMKVIST You're too young to know about that. PHOTO EDITOR Everyone here grows up knowing about her. It's how we're taught about strangers.
M	BJURMAN	My dear Lisbeth, how are you? I need more money. I need to pay my rent. She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over
M	BJURMAN	Come on in.
M	BJURMAN	Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys.

F	SALANDER	Do I have your attention now?
F	SALANDER	When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus. If something happens to me - if I get hit by a car - if you hit me with a car - same thing, it uploads automatically. fishes his apartment keys from his trousers. Shows

M	PERNILLA	On my way to Skelleftea. I can only stay a couple hours. He arrives and gives her a hug. What's in Skelleftea?
M	PERNILLA	Light of Life Bible Camp. Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay.
M	PERNILLA	They're not dangerous.
F	BLOMKVIST	It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs something.
M	PERNILLA	Just so long as it's not God.
F	BLOMKVIST	I didn't say that.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that. But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it.
M	PERNILLA	That's what I'm doing.
F	BLOMKVIST	It should have been me visiting you. I'm sorry.
M	PERNILLA	It's okay. Everything's good.
M	PERNILLA	Bye. BLOMKVIST Bye. The train begins to move.
M	PERNILLA	Don't go too hard on the Catholics.

M	PERNILLA	The article you're writing.
F	BLOMKVIST	What are you talking (about) -

F	BLOMKVIST	The Rebecka Case you mentioned. What was her last name if you recall.
M	MORELL O/S	Of course I do, but what would it have to do with anything?
F	BLOMKVIST	Nothing probably.
M	MORELL O/S	Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson.
F	BLOMKVIST	How was she killed? MORELL O/S Decapitated. Arms cut off. Burned.
M	MORELL O/S	But this happened in the 1940's - BLOMKVIST Hang on a second.

F	BLOMKVIST	I don't want to be indelicate. But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this. FRODE Wennerstrom.
F	BLOMKVIST	I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case.
M	FRODE	In case he dies? That is indelicate. BLOMKVIST And I apologize.
M	FRODE	I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in. So ... is that it then? Blomkvist drinks. Eventually -
F	BLOMKVIST	We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to him.
M	FRODE	You'd report to me, but does it matter? We both know nothing's going to come of this.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm not so sure.
M	FRODE	What do you mean?
F	BLOMKVIST	I may have found something.
M	FRODE	You're joking. What did you find? it's Blomkvist who studies Frode. He's not sure he
F	BLOMKVIST	The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings. BLOMKVIST I need a research assistant. Can you authorize that?
M	FRODE	Yes. Do you have one? BLOMKVIST I can find one.

M	FRODE	That I couldn't authorize. Blomkvist isn't sure how to play this. Then he is. BLOMKVIST Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. The investigator's name is on it, but I can find no record of her, and I'm pretty good at that sort of thing.
M	ARMANSKY	Would it really matter what her name is?
F	BLOMKVIST	It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do. ARMANSKY Against policy. BLOMKVIST You sure?
M	ARMANSKY	Just like your sources. You understand. BLOMKVIST Let me give you a name then.
F	BLOMKVIST	My sister. She's a lawyer. There's information in here that could only have come from one place. I think you know what I mean.
M	ARMANSKY	The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed. She's a ward of the State. BLOMKVIST What does that have to do with anything.
M	ARMANSKY	She's had a rough life. Can we not make it rougher on her?
F	SALANDER	Who is it? BLOMKVIST O/S Mikael Blomkvist. Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone
F	BLOMKVIST	May I come in? SALANDER Actually I'm not really up (yet) -
F	BLOMKVIST	That's okay. He pushes the door enough to pass. Has a paper bag and
F	BLOMKVIST	I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches. And tomato juice. Good for hangovers. Where do you keep the coffee? SALANDER Hey. Hey - Who do you think you are?
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do. He opens cabinets looking for the coffee. She stares.
F	BLOMKVIST	We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend. BLOMKVIST You're awake. Good. Breakfast is ready. BLOMKVIST I guess I alarmed you showing up like this. SALANDER If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you.
F	BLOMKVIST	That won't be necessary.
F	BLOMKVIST	Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining.
F	SALANDER	It wasn't meant to be.
F	BLOMKVIST	When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader.
F	SALANDER	Wennerstrom wasn't entertained. Blomkvist lets it go. BLOMKVIST Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer. I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ... Are you going to even touch your food?
F	SALANDER	What kind of research?
F	BLOMKVIST	Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth? I want you to help me catch a killer of women.
F	BLOMKVIST	I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson. I have no idea who the others are - or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl - but they have to be. His eyes settle on her blue-black "handcuffs" as hers
F	BLOMKVIST	We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with (anything) - BLOMKVIST What are you doing?
F	SALANDER	Getting started. You can keep talking if you want. Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus BLOMKVIST Would you like this?

M	DET. ISAKSSON	No one's asked me about Magda in over 40 years. No one here even remembers her.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	Why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing. SALANDER It interests me.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	Does it.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	What's that. A wasp? SALANDER A friend of mine calls me that.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	So you tattoo it on your neck? DET. ISAKSSON Who's this friend?
F	SALANDER	My trainer.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	Aerobics?
F	SALANDER	Boxing.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	I have a feeling you're pretty good at that, even though you weigh - what - ninety pounds? Float like a butterfly ...
F	SALANDER	What? DET. ISAKSSON Come with me, Muhammad.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	Her husband was our first suspect - the husband is always the first suspect, and usually the last - but not this time. We moved on to a neighbor. Then a vagrant - DET. ISAKSSON Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies, and you know you're never going to solve it. And that troubles him still, that he never solved it.
F	SALANDER	How exactly was she killed?
M	DET. ISAKSSON	Miss - I'm sorry -
F	SALANDER	Salander. DET. ISAKSSON Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate?
F	SALANDER	I have a high metabolism. I can't put on weight.
M	DET. ISAKSSON	That's not why I ask. I ask because it's better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach. He pushes the folder across the table to her ... looking like an aging overdressed vampire, Isabella, BLOMKVIST How is he? He needs surgery and there's no DNR. So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions.
M	FRODE	How'd it go with Ms. Salander?
F	BLOMKVIST	She said yes. BLOMVIST Can I see Henrik?
M	FRODE	He was asleep when I last looked in. We can check.
F	ISABELLA	No, you can't check. You can instruct him to pack his things and leave.
M	MARTIN	Mother - ISABELLA Don't use that tone with me. This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again.
M	FRODE	Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik. ISABELLA And who do you work for, Dirch? Remind me who pays your salary?
M	BIRGER	We should put this to a vote.
M	MARTIN	Don't be an idiot, Birger.
M	BIRGER	It's a family decision like any other. Cecilia?
F	CECILIA	What. BIRGER Am I right?
F	CECILIA	You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes. But (yes) -
M	MARTIN	No. We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants. ISABELLA Henrik - is in there fighting for his life. This - - is the last thing he needs.
M	NURSE O/S	Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, you can't smoke in here.
F	ISABELLA	Go back to Stockholm. When we want a false chronicle of the family written by a libelist, we know who to call.
M	HARRIET/PERNILLA	If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish. He shall lay his hand upon it's head ...slaughter it... empty it's blood on the base of the altar ... and he shall be forgiven. DET. ISAKSSON Forget what she looks like, I vouch for her -
M	DET. ISAKSSON O/S	She's smart. And she's serious about this.
M	UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE	All right. Thanks. UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE This way, Miss.
F	SALANDER	Can I make copies? UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE I can make them for you if our machine's been repaired. SALANDER That's okay.
M	MARTIN	My family is impossible. It's why the company is such a mess. Please accept my apology for my mother's behavior.
F	BLOMKVIST	It's all right. MARTIN It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik ... She lost it when my father died. The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven him. he seems as lost now as he must have been then.
M	MARTIN	You have to stay and keep working. You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away. But, please, do it as quickly as you can. BLOMKVIST I'll (try) -
F	BLOMKVIST	Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger.
M	MARTIN	How do you do. SALANDER Fine. comes past them without another word. Martin can't
M	MARTIN	Girlfriend?
F	BLOMKVIST	Assistant.
F	BLOMKVIST	Any trouble finding the place?
F	SALANDER	Everyone in town knows who and where you are.
F	BLOMKVIST	That's comforting. Are you hungry? Want a sandwich?
F	SALANDER	No. Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up,
F	BLOMKVIST	I used to have a motorcycle. When I was 19.
F	SALANDER	I know. She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the
F	SALANDER	The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed - three I'm sure about.
F	SALANDER	Rebecka was the first, like you thought ... M.H., is Mari Holmberg - a prostitute in Kalmar - murdered in 1954. Leviticus verse 20, line Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
F	BLOMKVIST	"If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood." SALANDER She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin. R.L. Rakel Lunde, brings up more crime photos -
F	SALANDER	Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader, tied up with a clothesline, gagged, raped, head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27.
F	BLOMKVIST	"A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning." lit a cigarette and brings up the next photos -
F	BLOMKVIST	I only smoke outside.
F	SALANDER	Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed, raped, charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus -
F	BLOMKVIST	21:9. "The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with (fire) -
F	SALANDER	Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 -
F	SALANDER	Found in a barn, stabbed and raped with farm tools. A cow in the next stall with its throat slit, its blood splashed on her, hers on it. Leviticus 20:16 - "If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast, their blood is upon (them) - SALANDER Lea Persson, 1962 -
F	SALANDER	Found by her sister in their pet shop - raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Leviticus 26:21/22. Before Blomkvist can find the verse, she's on to the next
F	SALANDER	Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967, a student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated - BLOMKVIST Okay -
F	SALANDER	I'm not done - BLOMKVIST It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer ... But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island?
F	SALANDER	She was looking for him, too. BLOMKVIST Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion. Anything I'm missing?
F	SALANDER	The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel - all from the Old Testament.
F	BLOMKVIST	Which means they're Jewish names. If there's one thing the Vangers have more than their share of, it's Nazis. There's one of them.
F	BLOMKVIST	I can see why Armansky values you so highly. Your work is very good. SALANDER It interests me.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'll take the couch. You can have the bed.
F	SALANDER	I can sleep on a couch.
F	BLOMKVIST	So can I.
F	BLOMKVIST	Okay. Good night. SALANDER Night. She switches off the lamp. Then, in a moment, in the
F	SALANDER	Harriet's name isn't.
F	BLOMKVIST	Isn't what.
F	SALANDER	Jewish.
M	BLOMKVIST O/S	What are you doing?
F	SALANDER	Going over your notes.
F	BLOMKVIST	They're encrypted.
F	SALANDER	Have some coffee.
F	BLOMKVIST	I will. And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos.
F	BLOMKVIST	Thank you.
F	SALANDER	Too bad you don't have hers.
F	BLOMKVIST	Whose.
F	SALANDER	Her. BLOMKVIST Excuse me.
F	BLOMKVIST	Can you read that?
F	SALANDER	A, C, Three - the rest is blocked.
F	SALANDER	N, something, R, S, J -
F	BLOMKVIST	Norsjo.
F	SALANDER	Then something, K, something, R, I, F, something, I -
F	BLOMKVIST	Carpentry. Is that a phone number? SALANDER Too small to read.
M	BLOMKVIST (ADR)	I'm going to have to go to Norsjo.
F	BLOMKVIST	I wouldn't think Harald would sign his name like this, would you?
M	FRODE	I can't say I know how he thinks. He might.
F	BLOMKVIST	Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here?
M	FRODE	Maybe Isabella. No one else.
F	BLOMKVIST	Could she do something like this?
F	ISABELLA	Who's this creature now?
M	FRODE	I'm calling this off.
F	BLOMKVIST	No. You're authorizing me to rent a car. BLOMKVIST I'm sorry if that was uncomfortable.
F	SALANDER	They don't bother me.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm sure they're not used to people who look like you. SALANDER They don't like you either.
M	TECH CLERK	I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky.
F	SALANDER	So call him. The clerk picks up a phone, but then sets it back down. TECH CLERK Next time, I'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork. INSERT: the car rental agreement - a print of the The main street of a very small town. The Volvo pulls to
M	CLERK 1	Can I help you? The clerk - for what Blomkvist needs - is too young.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm waiting for the older gentleman, thanks. He gestures to a clerk in his 60's helping a customer.
F	BLOMKVIST	The carpentry shop is gone. I don't know if he worked there or not. If he did, maybe he used to buy hardware here.
M	CLERK 2	I don't recognize him. Sorry.
F	BLOMKVIST	I had to start somewhere. Thanks. As he gathers up the photos to leave -
M	CLERK 2	I'm no detective, but I think I would've started at the retirement home. Blomkvist looks up. Not a bad idea.
M	FORSMAN	This is Brannlund's kid. He was a contractor, the father.
F	BLOMKVIST	Brannlund.
M	FORSMAN	Assar. Blomkvist writes the name down.
F	BLOMKVIST	You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, the son? FORSMAN Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago. But she might be alive - His widow. In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband. MILDRED Oh, my goodness, there we are. Who took this? BLOMKVIST Photographer at the local paper.
F	BLOMKVIST	You were taking pictures, too. Which I'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them. MILDRED It wouldn't be a miracle. We were on our honeymoon. But why? BLOMKVIST This girl was killed that day, soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her.
F	MILDRED	How awful.
F	MILDRED	She does look terrified. Mildred gets up with purpose, goes into another room,
F	BLOMKVIST	Would you mind if I made a copy of this?
M	BJURMAN	Ground, please. A finger presses it. The doors close and the elevator
F	SALANDER	How's your sex life?
F	SALANDER	I didn't care much for your last report. It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it. Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's. BJURMAN SALANDER Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice. Just nod.
F	SALANDER	Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me. He nods. She gets the elevator going again and steps
F	SALANDER	And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again - right here. It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind Motion detectors - security cameras - software that BLOMKVIST O/S It's me.
F	BLOMKVIST	It's that bad?
F	BLOMKVIST	Is it still bleeding? It's still bleeding ... why is it still bleeding ... She pulls a length of dental floss from its case -
M	BLOMKVIST (ADR)	Is that dental floss?
F	SALANDER	Yes. Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger
F	BLOMKVIST	What is that - Is that necessary?
F	SALANDER	Yes.
F	BLOMKVIST	We can't just tape it? SALANDER No. She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still
F	BLOMKVIST	Did you sterilize that?
F	SALANDER	No. BLOMKVIST You didn't?
F	SALANDER	Drink some more. He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his
F	BLOMKVIST	Careful, it's my eye.
F	SALANDER	Don't move. She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through
F	BLOMKVIST	What am I doing here ... why did I ever come up here ...
F	BLOMKVIST	It's too dark to see ... did it stop bleeding ... I think maybe it has ... it still fucking hurts ... BLOMKVIST It wasn't an accident ... Somebody was shooting at me ... It's insane ... these people are insane ... SALANDER No one's shooting at you now.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm pretty sure this isn't a good idea. SALANDER Why.
F	BLOMKVIST	Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together. SALANDER You work with what's-her-name. That's worked out for you.
F	BLOMKVIST	I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not.
F	SALANDER	You need to stop talking.
F	SALANDER	You want me to open a window?
F	SALANDER	I like working with you.
F	BLOMKVIST	I like working with you, too.
M	FRODE	People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot.
M	MARTIN	Not from Gunner. If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him.
M	FRODE	We get poachers. They're not always such great shots.
M	MARTIN	Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is? This has to stop. regards Blomkvist.
M	FRODE	Do you want to stop?
F	BLOMKVIST	I have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my own notes, and Lisbeth's research. What I don't have are Vanger Industries records. That's what I want.
M	FRODE	Why?
F	BLOMKVIST	Will you authorize it?
M	FRODE	I could but why on earth would I?
F	BLOMKVIST	Because I'm asking.
M	FRODE	The private corporate records. How far back?
F	BLOMKVIST	All the way.
F	BLOMKVIST	Henrik said I have access to everything I need. This is what I need.
M	FRODE	That's not what he meant.
F	BLOMKVIST	Let's ask him. He's not well enough to ask.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you.
M	FRODE	Excuse us a moment.
M	MARTIN	I think Henrik would say yes. FRODE That's why he has me. To protect him from himself. This is insane. MARTIN What do we have to hide?
M	FRODE	Over the course of 120 years of doing business? Plenty. MARTIN If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission. This goes against every privileged, confidential bone
F	SALANDER	What am I looking for? BLOMKVIST Any connections between the company's holdings and the towns where the women were killed ... and everything about Frode.
M	BLOMKVIST V/O	Your father was taking pictures that day no one has seen.
F	BLOMKVIST	I'd like to if I could. CECILIA So ask him.
F	BLOMKVIST	I was wondering if you could do that.
F	CECILIA	I don't speak to him, as you know.
F	BLOMKVIST	You couldn't make an exception in my case. Are you afraid to be in the same room with him? I'm not saying you shouldn't be. BLOMKVIST You won't help me? CECILIA Sorry.
M	LINDGREN	Are you finished?
F	SALANDER	No. I need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966.
M	LINDGREN	You already have everything.
F	SALANDER	I don't. Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or suppliers.
M	LINDGREN	Then you'll have to do without.
F	SALANDER	Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this.
M	LINDGREN	He said you have access to this floor.
F	SALANDER	Call him. The woman stares at her for a long moment, then picks up
M	HARALD	Sven Olof Lindholm. HARALD Me.
F	BLOMKVIST	Handsome.
M	HARALD	Birger Furugard. Me. Per Engdahl. Me.
M	HARALD	But your interest is in my more candid photographic work.
M	HARALD	Blom ... kvist ... With an `o' - or a `u.'
F	BLOMKVIST	`o.'
M	HARALD	An `o.' Blom - kvist.
M	HARALD	I'm not a recluse. I don't close my door to anyone. They just don't visit.
F	BLOMKVIST	Perhaps if you redecorated. HARALD Hide the past like they do. Under a thin, shiny veneer. Like an Ikea table. I'm the most honest of all of them.
F	BLOMKVIST	The family. HARALD Sweden.
M	HARALD	Two point eight.
F	BLOMKVIST	Pardon me? HARALD The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad. Excellent lens.
M	HARALD	Landscape? Some nice landscapes there.
F	BLOMKVIST	No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle.
M	HARALD	That's Gottfried's boy.
F	BLOMKVIST	Martin? Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing -
M	HARALD	Handsome but useless young man, Martin. Like his father.
M	LINDGREN	We're closing.
F	SALANDER	Nowhere near finished.
M	LINDGREN	I'm not staying late.
F	SALANDER	I am. And I need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked. Call Frode. LINDGREN V/O She wants to look at everything. I don't like her and I don't trust her. There's something wrong with her. FRODE Hang on a second - I'm going to let you decide. It's Ms. Lindgren again.
M	MARTIN	Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem? LINDGREN V/O This girl wants a set of keys now. To my room as well. It's outrageous.
M	MARTIN	It's fine. Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done. LINDGREN Stay all night if you want. Leave the keys with the guard. It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor, Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari `Gottfried's useless boy' - He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps -
M	MARTIN O/S	Hello? Mikael? MARTIN Your evening stroll? BLOMKVIST Hi. How are you?
M	MARTIN	I stopped at the hospital on my way home. Henrik asked me to ask you something. BLOMKVIST What.
M	MARTIN	Come on in, I'll make you a drink. Uppsala. Same place as Lena - though it's what young
M	MARTIN	What happened to you? BLOMKVIST When.
M	MARTIN	Now.
F	BLOMKVIST	I fell in the dark. MARTIN You don't have a flashlight? I'll give you one.
F	BLOMKVIST	I just wasn't being careful.
M	MARTIN	How's the investigation? BLOMKVIST Nothing new to report.
M	MARTIN	Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up.
F	BLOMKVIST	Maybe.
F	BLOMKVIST	Thanks. SALANDER Hello, Martin.
F	BLOMKVIST	What did he say?
M	MARTIN	What?
F	BLOMKVIST	You said Henrik asked you to ask me something.
M	MARTIN	I just did.
F	BLOMKVIST	What?
M	MARTIN	How the investigation's going. That was his question.
F	BLOMKVIST	Oh.
M	MARTIN	You hunt? We should go hunting together sometime.
F	BLOMKVIST	Sure.
M	MARTIN	Nothing at all? New. To report. BLOMKVIST No. regards Blomkvist in another silence. Then -
M	MARTIN	I can see you're anxious.
F	BLOMKVIST	No.
M	MARTIN	To get home. After your walk.
F	BLOMKVIST	I suppose I am.
M	MARTIN	To have dinner. With your girlfriend. BLOMKVIST My assistant. Yes. MARTIN We'll have better luck with a gun.
F	BLOMKVIST	Sorry? MARTIN When we go hunting.
M	MARTIN	A gun. Rather than a knife.
M	MARTIN	You just couldn't stay away, could you.
M	MARTIN	I want to show you something. Bring your drink. Leave the knife.
M	MARTIN	You know what's harder than shooting someone? Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin.
F	BLOMKVIST	It didn't work. I'm here.
M	MARTIN	Mikael, it did work. You're here. They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a
M	MARTIN	Open it. Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As
M	MARTIN	Push it open.
M	MARTIN	Switch is on the left. Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to
M	MARTIN	Why didn't you just go home. BLOMKVIST I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed.
M	MARTIN	How'd you do it? What did you find? Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
M	MARTIN	We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you.
F	BLOMKVIST	I found a picture no one had seen before. MARTIN Of. BLOMKVIST You. In your Uppsala prep school blazer.
M	MARTIN	What does that say?
F	BLOMKVIST	That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when.
M	MARTIN	Did I? If I did, so what. People lie all the time.
F	BLOMKVIST	It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate. MARTIN Lena ... Lena was a long time ago. Where's this picture now? With all the other junk on your desk?
F	BLOMKVIST	A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site. That's a lie ... How much does the girl know?
M	MARTIN	Let's hope it's as much as you. That'll make it more fun. Where is she?
F	BLOMKVIST	Stockholm. She went there this morning. MARTIN And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives - He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when
M	MARTIN	I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.
F	SALANDER	Mikael - ? Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
M	MARTIN	So what would you like to know? are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist
M	MARTIN	You're the journalist, ask me something. MARTIN What do I do with my guests? Is that the question? Well, before - I do what we're doing. Relax, have a drink, converse. I like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. After - I simply get rid of them. Out to sea - - unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies. That's not smart if you ask me. That's just garish and loud. But he was a garish and loud man. Frankly, he got what he deserved. from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what
M	MARTIN	You can't be a sloppy technician like that. You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess.
M	MARTIN	That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean; you have secrets. You had one when you came up here. It made you feel - special. Didn't it?
M	MARTIN	No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination. I need ... - destruction.
M	MARTIN	Can I ask you something? Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house. Did I force you? Did I grab you and drag you in? I just offered you a drink. You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what? It is. They always come willingly.
M	MARTIN	And then they're here. They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance. "Maybe if I say the right thing - if I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe I'll survive." And then the moment comes when they realize ... no, all hope is gone.
M	MARTIN (CONT'D)	And when that happens - when I see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now - - well, I feel myself getting hard just watching it. Silence ...
M	MARTIN	Say something.
F	BLOMKVIST	You are a sick fuck. MARTIN ... Is this an interview or an editorial?
M	MARTIN	You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels. Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence. Then -
M	MARTIN	Anything else you want to know? You sure? All right. Whatever you say. Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property. Nothing but the sky darkening to night. Then - A figure appearing on foot at the front gate. Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, MARTIN It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage. Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met in Belarus. Just another girl. Another immigrant whore. Who misses them? BLOMKVIST Your sister wasn't just another girl. Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches
M	MARTIN	What happened to her.
F	BLOMKVIST	You're choking me - MARTIN You found her? BLOMKVIST You killed her.
M	MARTIN	You useless fuckin detective.
M	MARTIN	Too tight to talk? is. Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.
M	MARTIN	Good. I'm tired of talking to you. MARTIN Would you like me to do something about that?
M	MARTIN	See? I'm not a monster. frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some
M	MARTIN	You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too.
M	MARTIN	It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ MARTIN Goodbye, Mikael. pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the darts for the gun he left on the workbench - takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her
F	SALANDER	May I kill him?
F	BLOMKVIST	He has more guns in the den -
F	SALANDER	I know. barely manage to speak - BLOMKVIST Where is he?
F	SALANDER	Dead.
M	SALANDER O/S	It's open.
M	FRODE	Where's Mikael?
F	SALANDER	Asleep. Coffee? There's no milk.
M	FRODE	I have some very upsetting news. Martin was killed in a car accident last night.
F	SALANDER	Sad. FRODE What?
F	SALANDER	I said it's sad.
M	FRODE	What do you know about this?
M	FRODE	
F	SALANDER	Let him sleep.
M	FRODE	What are we going to do?
F	SALANDER	We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do.
M	FRODE	I'm going to the police.
F	SALANDER	Show them the videos while you're at it.
M	FRODE	The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes.
F	SALANDER	Would you like to see them?
M	FRODE	No.
F	BLOMKVIST	How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state?
F	SALANDER	I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
F	BLOMKVIST	Since when have they said that.
F	SALANDER	Since I was twelve. BLOMKVIST Something happened when you were twelve?
F	BLOMKVIST	It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything -
F	SALANDER	I tried to kill my father. I burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of him.
F	BLOMKVIST	Oh. We need milk. One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, BLOMKVIST Harriet?
F	SALANDER	I think so.
F	BLOMKVIST	Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her. He didn't kill her. And his father was dead the year before. What if she did somehow get away? Could she have done that? Could she have done it alone? He goes up to his wall of suspects.
F	BLOMKVIST	Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is. VANGER Poor Martin.
F	BLOMKVIST	I have to go away for a couple days. When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you. Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ... VANGER Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy.
F	BLOMKVIST	She's my partner, Henrik. She should stay. A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the
F	VANGER	What have you found?
F	BLOMKVIST	I'm not sure.
F	VANGER	Don't treat me like a child. Tell me.
F	BLOMKVIST	I can't. I don't know. I need a week.
F	VANGER	I've waited forty years. I can wait another week.
F	BLOMKVIST	I always liked this song. You don't?
F	SALANDER	I don't like classical music. A strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange-
M	TRINITY	Plague?
M	PLAGUE	Trinity. SALANDER Wasp.
F	BLOMKVIST	... Mikael.
F	SALANDER	The money. Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic
F	BLOMKVIST	Fuck me. He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage
F	SALANDER	It's your turn.
F	BLOMKVIST	It's me. Sorry to bother you.
F	ANITA	What do you want?
F	BLOMKVIST	No one's called you?
F	ANITA	About.
F	BLOMKVIST	Your cousin.
F	BLOMKVIST	Martin.
F	ANITA	What about him?
F	BLOMKVIST	He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry. There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but -
F	ANITA	I'm not interested in any memorial.
F	BLOMKVIST	I understand.
F	ANITA	What do you understand?
F	BLOMKVIST	That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know.
F	ANITA	Now I know.
F	SALANDER	How'd it go?
F	BLOMKVIST	Okay. I think.
M	TRINITY	She's on.
F	BLOMKVIST	She's playing solitaire? And she still hasn't called anyone. SALANDER No.
F	BLOMKVIST	Do we have her cell, too? Salander points to one of the windows on the screen.
F	BLOMKVIST	I was so she'd lead us to her.
F	SALANDER	Put your hand back on my shoulder. He does. They watch the solitaire game together ...
F	SALANDER	There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet. She can't because Harriet is indeed dead. BLOMKVIST I was just thinking. What if -
F	SALANDER	Ten more seconds. That's fair. She finishes. They lie there. Then -
F	SALANDER	Okay, what.
F	BLOMKVIST	I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility.
F	BLOMKVIST	May I? ANITA What is it now. He comes in and sits.
F	BLOMKVIST	I want to show you something.
F	BLOMKVIST	Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ... Harriet. They sit together on a park bench.
F	BLOMKVIST	Anita married in Stockholm in 1967. It's recorded in the Swedish General Register. But the family never knew, did they. I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport. HARRIET Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself.
F	BLOMKVIST	What did he think about that?
F	HARRIET	Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did.
F	BLOMKVIST	They both died twenty years ago.
F	HARRIET	A car accident. You found that, too.
F	BLOMKVIST	Is this you? He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids HARRIET I was 14 the first time he raped me.
F	BLOMKVIST	Martin.
F	HARRIET	No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died.
F	BLOMKVIST	Why didn't you tell someone? HARRIET I did. My mother.
F	BLOMKVIST	Henrik would have done something.
F	HARRIET	Would he? I don't know. I almost told him. But I was afraid because of what I did. You still don't understand? HARRIET A year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes. He wrapped a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me. I made it out of the house and down to the dock. He came staggering after me - Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the
M	HARRIET V/O	I could never fight him off in a small room, but I was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk. HARRIET V/O When it was finally over I looked up, and Martin was standing there -
M	HARRIET V/O	With a little smile.
F	HARRIET	He dragged me back to the cabin ... All I'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another.
M	HARRIET V/O	A couple months later, Henrik sent him off to school in Uppsala. And I thought maybe - maybe - the nightmare was over. Until that day. The float with the harem girls comes past, and we watch HARRIET V/O There he was - across the street - looking at me with that same little smile on his face.
M	HARRIET V/O	It wasn't over.
F	BLOMKVIST	How'd you get away? Anita?
F	ANITA	Don't take anything. Harriet puts the clothes back. Picks up her purse.
F	ANITA	Leave that, too. ANITA Stay absolutely still.
F	HARRIET	How did you get away?
F	BLOMKVIST	Someone saved me, too.
F	BLOMKVIST	How are you feeling?
F	VANGER	I'm fine. Thank you, Anna. Anna leaves. Closes the doors. Before Blomkvist can say
F	VANGER	I made you a promise. Whether you found out anything or not.
F	VANGER	Now. What do you have to tell me.
F	HARRIET	Hi, Henrik. FRODE ... I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ... BLOMKVIST Why would you. It was a long time ago. Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled.
M	FRODE	I don't think I'm seeing the point.
F	BLOMKVIST	Yes, you are. FRODE It happened in the 1970's ... I swear I didn't know this was what Henrik had on him. If I had, I never would have let him bring you up here. But he wasn't trying to deceive you.
F	BLOMKVIST	Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that. Frode disagrees -
M	FRODE	A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.
F	BLOMKVIST	The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this.
M	FRODE	Of course you're right ... I'm sorry.
F	SALANDER	Fuck these people ... BLOMKVIST Yeah ... SALANDER Harriet most of all.
F	BLOMKVIST	Excuse me?
F	SALANDER	If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women.
F	BLOMKVIST	She had no idea he was doing it.
F	SALANDER	She should have killed her father and him. BLOMKVIST That's what you would've done. Not everyone's you.
F	BLOMKVIST	That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder.
F	SALANDER	What happened with Wennerstrom. How did he get you?
F	BLOMKVIST	I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. Not a good day, that. Then - SALANDER You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom?
F	SALANDER	I started investigating him on my own. Then you showed up and hired me. I haven't had a chance to look at it all - you and Harriet-fucking- Vanger have kept me busy ... but I may have something.
F	BLOMKVIST	On Wennerstrom.
F	BLOMKVIST	Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire.
F	ERIKA	How do you know this?
F	BLOMKVIST	This time you don't want to know.
F	ERIKA	This time I do want to know. BLOMKVIST I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'.
F	ERIKA	And how do you have that? BLOMKVIST I could have gotten it from a source inside the company. ERIKA But you didn't.
F	BLOMKVIST	But that's what you'll say.
F	ERIKA	But what will you say to me?
F	BLOMKVIST	That depends on if you really want to know.
F	ERIKA	I do. Who gave you access? What looks like 16-year-old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key. Crosses past Erika with a ANNOUNCER Journalist Mikael Blomkvist - who this time last year was convicted of libel in a Stockholm courtroom - doesn't seem to have learned from that experience. Or maybe he has - Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
M	ANNOUNCER	In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself.
F	BLOMKVIST	He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate.
F	SALANDER	Then.
F	BLOMKVIST	We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him. That's probably it, though. These guys never to prison. this as he is.
F	BLOMKVIST	What's wrong.
F	SALANDER	It's embarrassing. BLOMKVIST What.
F	SALANDER	I need to borrow some money. grins and reaches for his wallet. SALANDER I have a chance to make an investment. It's a smart, safe investment.
F	BLOMKVIST	I don't know that I have that much.
F	SALANDER	You do. I'm sorry that I know that. You have 65 thousand in your two accounts. He's no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more
F	SALANDER	You'll get the money back. I promise.
M	WENNERSTROM	These allegations - like the last ones from this so-called journalist - are as ridiculous as they are untrue -
M	WENNERSTROM	I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again. I'm looking forward to it.
M	REPORTER	What about his documentation?
M	WENNERSTROM	Fabricated. All of it.
M	ANNOUNCER	The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrom of that. FSA OFFICIAL If even a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist is alleging proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organized crime inquiry as well.
M	REPORTER	Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.
M	FSA OFFICIAL	And we can't force him to. But we can look for them.
M	REPORTER	Beginning where?
M	FSA OFFICIAL	Beginning with those closest to Mr. Wennerstrom. Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this could have access to this kind of information.
M	LAWYER	Mr. Wennerstrom isn't available for comment today, but as his legal counsel, I'd be happy to answer your questions. REPORTER Where is he?
M	LAWYER	At home, I imagine.
M	REPORTER	He isn't. Has he left the country?
M	LAWYER	I don't think so.
M	ANNOUNCER	With his failure to appear before a Security Exchange Commission panel, a warrant has been issued for The Wennerstrom Group CEO.
M	IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL	I can confirm that he left Sweden on a private jet that landed in Paris last week, but whether he's still there, we don't know. He could be anywhere by now. She sips at her room service coffee.
F	SALANDER	I have a number of accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands. I want to transfer those funds and convert them to bonds. As she writes an account number on a slip of paper from

F	SALANDER	Naturally.
M	WAGNER	How many accounts will you be transferring? SALANDER Thirty. WAGNER This will take some time.
F	SALANDER	For which you'll receive a 4-percent commission.
M	WAGNER	I will.
F	SALANDER	Then it won't be a waste of it. She offers him the Zimmerstal pen.
M	WAGNER	Thank you, I have one.
M	REPORTER	A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados says he knows where fugitive financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom is: Here in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown. Police released this photograph, taken yesterday by the tourist, Jens Assur - A snapshot of Wennerstrom, or someone who looks like him -
M	REPORTER	- and say they believe it is the disgraced billionaire.
M	HASSELMAN	How many of these would you like to convert for deposit?
F	SALANDER	All fifty. Into five accounts. SALANDER That looks correct. ZURICH REPORTER O/S The man who is now being called Sweden's Pablo Escobar, may not have a country to call home, but does have enough money to buy one.
M	ZURICH REPORTER	According to the International Banking Commission, Wennerstrom, just days after the Millennium article that brought him down appeared on news stands, began emptying accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld in the Cayman Islands. ZURICH REPORTER ON TV That money, approximately two billion Euros, was then spread over a number of accounts with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich -
M	ZURICH REPORTER ON TV	- who converted the funds into private bonds, which, I'm told, are even harder to trace than Wennerstrom himself. Europol has launched a search for the woman who had used a stolen Norwegian passport. Her whereabouts, like her boss's, are unknown.
F	SALANDER	The money I borrowed.
F	BLOMKVIST	Already. BLOMKVIST Thank you.
F	SALANDER	Thank you.
F	BLOMKVIST	Good investment?
F	SALANDER	It was okay. What are you doing later? BLOMKVIST Seeing my daughter.
F	SALANDER	Okay.
F	BLOMKVIST	You look nice. SALANDER Thanks. Christmas again ... see you soon.
F	SALANDER	Can you hear me? I miss our meetings. I'm sure you don't. Why would you? I was always such a headache for you. Never showing up with good news. Only problems. I have some good news now. I've made a friend. I mean one that you'd approve of. I'm happy. cordoned off with police tape -
M	REPORTER	Behind the walls of this dingy rooming house behind me lies a body in a pool of blood - A man who has been living here the last three weeks under the name Victor Fleming - REPORTER O/S A man who police in Marbella, Spain, have confirmed is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerstrom - REPORTER ON TV - shot three times in the head at close range in what is being called a classic gangland execution. BARISTA What would you like?
M	REPORTER ON TV	The investigation into Wennerstrom's ties to crime organizations worldwide will now turn to speculation: Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?
M	BARISTA	Sir?
M	REPORTER ON TV	Wennerstrom spent the last days of his flamboyant life in solitude and anonymity, locked behind the door of Room 3A - BLOMKVIST ... Coffee and a sandwich ... that one.
M	REPORTER ON TV	Indeed, after checking in, he was never seen again - until this morning when the building manager came calling to collect the unpaid bill -
F	SALANDER	It's perfect.
M	TAILOR	Your father? SALANDER A friend. TAILOR Must be a very good friend. He's lucky. can't move. Waits for the pain to subside -
M	forever.
