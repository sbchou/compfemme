M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	GWEN	On your left, honey.
F	JUSTINE	What's that cashier's name?
F	GWEN	Can't say.
F	JUSTINE	When did he start working here?
F	GWEN	Don't know. Yesterday?
F	JUSTINE	Who is he?
F	GWEN	Don't know. Can't say.
F	JUSTINE	What are you doing?
F	GWEN	It's called work, princess. Kind of fun. You might want to give it a go someday.
F	CHERYL	Attention, shoppers. There's a Retail Rodeo special on aisle three. Liquid drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for $5. Liquid drain cleaner has churning power and will churn right through your pipes. Ladies, shove something clean and new up your filthy pipes. Liquid drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Retail Rodeo.
M	CORNY	Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for a second?
F	JUSTINE	Yeah.
M	CORNY	I was just curious. Have you ever been to a Bible study? Yeah.
M	CORNY	We got a good one going on every Wednesday at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney comes, Benita comes. You got any interest in reading the Bible?
F	JUSTINE	I have my own, you know, beliefs.
M	CORNY	We don't preach fire and brimstone. Just the Ten Commandments. Were not interested in scaring people. Were about loving Jesus.
F	JUSTINE	I kinda like my nights to myself.
M	CORNY	Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you. Drive safe.
F	JUSTINE	Bye-bye.
M	BUBBA	Hey, Justine.
M	PHIL	Hey, Teeny. How was your day?
F	JUSTINE	The same. How was yours?
M	BUBBA	The wind was flipping paint in our eyes.
M	PHIL	Paint stings. Feel like I've been attacked by hornets in my eyeballs.
F	JUSTINE	Bubba, stand up.
M	BUBBA	Why?
F	JUSTINE	For Christ's sakes. Look at that couch, Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This ain't gonna come off. Damn it, Phil.
M	TV REPORTER	...including this gorgeous eggplant...
M	PHIL	I think we got most of it out.
F	JUSTINE	You two were stoned. You, keep frying your brain liike that, you'll slip off a ladder and crack open your head bone. You do really stupid things when you're high, Phil.
M	PHIL	Like what?
F	JUSTINE	Like sitting on my couch with your big blue ass. Everything just turns to shit. You finally get nice things, then everything just gets messed up. Why is this TV buzzing? It's the wind doing that. They the wind's coming in different lately.
F	JUSTINE	Different from what? What you reading?
M	HOLDEN	Catcher in the Rye I'm named after it.
F	JUSTINE	What's your name? Catcher?
M	HOLDEN	Holden. After Holden Caulfield. He's the main character. What's he do?
M	HOLDEN	He's put upon by society. Hypocrisy of the world.
F	JUSTINE	I notice that you're, uh, not very social.
M	HOLDEN	I'm a writer.
F	JUSTINE	What do you write?
M	HOLDEN	Novels, plays, screenplays, stories, poetry.
F	GWEN	be right with you. Where is she?
F	JUSTINE	I better go. What happens at the end of your book?
M	HOLDEN	Oh, he has a nervous breakdown. Goes to a mental hospital.
F	GWEN	You don't get paid to pick your crack. You get paid to work.
F	JUSTINE	I'm not sure I can do makeovers.
F	GWEN	Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner, mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder it up. Then you take a moist tissue, roll it in a ball and toss it in their face! Jeez, Louise... I'm talking to a tree stump! Girl, where are you?!
F	JUSTINE	Sorry, Im just a little tired.
F	GWEN	It's the food you eat, Justine. Look at me. I am 10 years older than you and have 10 times your energy. Cause I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy. It's probably why you can't get pregnant, honey. And why you have that hung-jaw look on your face. It's the cheese in your pizza and the chicken in your salad.
F	JUSTINE	I went to the doctor. He says I'm fertile. He says I could repopulate the entire planet.
F	GWEN	Then what's the deal here? Did he say you get enough vitamins?
F	JUSTINE	He didn't say.
M	PHIL	You could make paint where, at different angles, the house is different colours. You stand at the front door and the house is red. You stand at the street and the house is green. Or you could make, like, an invisible paint. Make the whole house disappear. What would be really neat is a paint that could change the molecular structure of a house, like a chemical acid deal.
M	PHIL	What do you think, Teeny?
F	JUSTINE	I think you two are a pair of potheads.
F	CHERYL	You getting a whole one of these or a half?
M	CUSTOMER	That oneright there.
F	CHERYL	You didn't bring this into the store?
M	CUSTOMER	No.
F	CHERYL	Well then, I'll charge you for it. This is a hand lotion. So don't put it anywhere else, even if you need lubrication. We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer is at fault. Here's your change and Fuck you very much.
M	CUSTOMER	Excuse me?
F	CHERYL	Thank you very much.
F	GWEN	Good as new, I'll tell ya, good as new.
F	JUSTINE	Now, you might be interested in purchasing some of the products I used today...
M	CUSTOMER	Oh, I'm not buying anything today.
F	GWEN	Well, that'd be a mistake. These are bargain prices.
M	CUSTOMER	I didn't bring my purse.
F	JUSTINE	I hate my job. That makes two of us.
F	JUSTINE	I hate everyone here. I hate Gwen. I don't know what the hell she's so happy about. I'm sorry I don't understand why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody to pieces.
M	HOLDEN	Maybe you're a maniac.
F	JUSTINE	Maybe so. You know you're lips are real pouty, like a woman. And how your eyes droop off to the side. How old are you?
M	HOLDEN	Twenty two.
F	JUSTINE	I'm an old lady next to you.
M	HOLDEN	How old are you?
F	JUSTINE	How old do you think?
M	HOLDEN	I don't know.
F	JUSTINE	I am thirty years old.
M	HOLDEN	How long you been workin' here for?
F	JUSTINE	Forever and a day!
F	JUSTINE	You don't have a car?
M	HOLDEN	Oh, I live right down the street.
F	JUSTINE	Well, you can ride in here, there's room.
M	HOLDEN	You wanna come in?
F	JUSTINE	I don't know. I'm in a funk.
M	HOLDEN	Well, I'm not gonna beg ya.
M	HOLDEN	I'll be in my room.
M	MOTHER	Okay, Tom.
F	JUSTINE	They call you Tom? It's my slave name. Holden's what I call myself. This is my room.
F	JUSTINE	Not aolt to look at. What are your folks like?
M	HOLDEN	They're okay. They don't get me. I mean, they're alright.
F	JUSTINE	My husband doesn't get me.
M	HOLDEN	Since when do you have a husband?
F	JUSTINE	Since seven years. He's a painter.
M	HOLDEN	What's he paint?
F	JUSTINE	Houses. He's a pig. He talks but he doesn't think. You go to college?
M	HOLDEN	Um, I had to drop out. I had a problem with drinkin' and stuff. I'll go back. I just gotta prove to my parents that I can fly staright. You go to college?
F	JUSTINE	No, I was afraid I'd lose Phil if I went. Now that'd be reason enough to go. I saw you in the store and I liked how you kept to yourself. I can see in your eyes that you hate the world. I hate it too. You know what I'm talkin' about?
F	JUSTINE	After livin in the dark for so long a glimspe of the light can make you giddy. Strange thought come into your head and you'd better think 'em. Has a special fate been callin' you and you not listenin? Is there a secret message right in front you, and you're not reading it? Is this your last, best chance? Are you gonna take it? Or are you goin' to the grave with unlived lives in your vains? Teeny, you're pretty. Bubba, isn't Teeny pretty?
M	BUBBA	I've seen better, I've seen worse. Nah. That's why I ain't never married. You got yourself the best fish in the sea.
M	PHIL	I wonder what it'd be like to be a woman. All that smooth skin and long hair.
M	BUBBA	If I was a woman, I'd be a slut. A lesbian slut.
F	JUSTINE	Gwen says smokin' marijuana lowers your sperm.
M	PHIL	Lowers it to where?
F	JUSTINE	Maybe you're the infertile one 'round here. Maybe every time you smoke a little dooby, you're killin' our unborn children.
F	GWEN	Alright, close.
F	JUSTINE	Why you limping.
M	HOLDEN	I twisted up my ankle on the stairs. I was wonderin', maybe you could give me a ride home?
F	JUSTINE	Yeah, sure okay. Alright I'll talk to you about it later.
F	GWEN	All I know is, everyone should have one beau, before anyone has two beaus.
F	JUSTINE	He's not my beau, he's my friend.
F	CHERYL	Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers! There's a Retail Rodeo special on all bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls and goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering these aisles, day after day. I'll put a Halloween curse on you.
F	GWEN	Night Corny. Happy Halloween.
M	CORNY	Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all the same.
F	GWEN	Which ankle did you twist, Holden?
M	HOLDEN	My, uh, left.
F	GWEN	Maybe you should put some cold water on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame.
M	HOLDEN	Okay.
F	JUSTINE	You're a writer so you have yourself a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine other cities, other jobs I could have. Other husbands. Now I don't even know what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have a husband.
M	HOLDEN	You said he was a pig.
F	JUSTINE	Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody. I was thinking about what you were sayin' about my sperm bein' low. I mean, I know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to have it confirmed by an expert.
F	JUSTINE	Oh who gives a shit, who needs a F&$%' baby around here anyways? If you wanna make yourself useful, why don't you get that goddamn TV fixed?!
M	PHIL	What the hell? It sounds like a helicopter is landin' in here.
F	GWEN	You want a blackberry, honey? A man was sellin' 'em on the road.
F	JUSTINE	No thank you.
M	CORNY	This is for you Justine. It's from Holden.
F	JUSTINE	Well where is he?
M	CORNY	He's got the day off. He came by this morning with it.
F	JUSTINE	Thanks.
M	CORNY	Don't mention it. Hey, Gwen.
F	GWEN	Hey sugar.
M	HOLDEN	Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last two days have been the most god-awful days of my life. I've not been able to get rid of you in my head. I never wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted many things. I'd given up long ago on being gotten by someone else, and then you came along. The idea of being gotten, because of circumstance, will never get got is the worst feeling I've ever felt, and I have felt many bad feelings. I'm sorry I can never see you again, Justine, forgive me for being so weak, but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden Wurther. If for some reason, you could change your mind and want to be with me, body and soul, meet me after work. I will be waiting for you at five PM outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not there at five, you will never see me in your lifetime.
F	JUSTINE	Gwen? What's wrong?
F	JUSTINE	Gwen? Gwen you sick?
M	JACK	Justine? Justine what's goin' on in here? Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her to a hospital. Justine you drive her. Well what time is it?
M	JACK	It's aquarter to five. Why, you gotta be somewhere?
F	JUSTINE	Gwen?
F	GWEN	Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that I sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts.
F	JUSTINE	I'm gonna let you off here, okay?
F	GWEN	Okay,You'll meet me inside?
F	JUSTINE	Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet you inside.
F	GWEN	Okay. Your a doll.
M	HOLDEN	Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came.
F	JUSTINE	I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.
M	HOLDEN	Oh god, thank god.
F	JUSTINE	Where are we goin'?
M	HOLDEN	Let's go to my house. No, with your folks there?
M	HOLDEN	Let's just park somewhere.
F	JUSTINE	This isn't well planned.
M	HOLDEN	Look. I don't know. I don't care I just wanna hold you.
M	HOTEL GUY	That's fourty five dollars even. And I need you to fill this out for me. I can't do it.
M	HOLDEN	We'll be back here before you know it.
F	JUSTINE	I don't wanna... I don't wanna go.
M	HOLDEN	Justine. I'm yours. I'm all yours. Hey.
M	JUTSINE	Hey.
M	PHIL	Were you been?
F	JUSTINE	Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin' up all over the store. I had to take her to the hositpal, and sat with her.
M	PHIL	Did she sick up on you?
F	JUSTINE	No.
M	PHIL	Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles)
F	JUSTINE	It's not funny, Phil, this is serious. I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too. And the next day. Justine? What happened to you?
F	JUSTINE	What?
M	JACK	I went down to St. Catherine's to check up on Gwen. I looked all over for you, she was askin' for you.
F	JUSTINE	Well, how is she?
M	JACK	She was heavin' up until there was nothin' left to heave. Doctor said she must've eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite in it or somethin'.
F	JUSTINE	I bet it was those blackberries.
M	JACK	They're gonna keep her in there until she gets better so you're gonna have to supervise cosmetics.
F	JUSTINE	Stop it, somebody's gonna see!
M	HOLDEN	Who cares, I don't care. I crave you. I wanna know everything about you. Who are you?
F	JUSTINE	I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas when I was eleven. My daddy was in the Air Force.
M	HOLDEN	I wanna knock open your head and see what's inside. I've had so much pain in my life. I know you have too, I can see it.
F	JUSTINE	Holden gave me two of his stories to read. It's like what a story would be. I was about a boy who was put upon, his mother was cold and selfish, and his father wanted him to play football. Other people didn't get him, especially girls. Then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him. So he starts actin' out, drinkin', and doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end the boy kills himself but jumpin' over abridge. The second story was pretty much the same as the first. Except at the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' a bottle of bug poison.
F	JUSTINE	Your stories are intense.
M	HOLDEN	I just wanna leave some kind of legacy. Somethin' great. After that I don't care what happens to me.
F	JUSTINE	Don't say that. I wish there was a story about me. I don't know who would read it though.
M	HOLDEN	I would.
F	JUSTINE	I like this. I like havin' a secret. You gave me a secret Holden.
M	HOLDEN	Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious. And dark and twisted.
F	JUSTINE	I'm going to hell, aren't I?
M	HOLDEN	Yes, you are.
F	JUSTINE	That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car. Phil takes that truck to work everyday. Bubba picks him up, and drops him off. Why, why would that truck be parked there?
M	HOLDEN	I don't know.
F	JUSTINE	If he finds out about us....
M	HOLDEN	I won't let him hurt you.
F	JUSTINE	He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll beat me, but he'll kill you.
M	HOLDEN	You can't worry about somethin' that hasn't even happened yet.
F	JUSTINE	I gotta go to the hospital.
M	HOLDEN	
F	JUSTINE	Don't! I mean he could be followin' us.
M	CORNY	Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.
F	JUSTINE	Who?
M	CORNY	Gwen! She just passed away.
F	JUSTINE	What do you mean? I thought she had a stomach ache?
M	CORNY	It got worse. She was on life support all day.
F	JUSTINE	I don't understand.
M	CORNY	It's God's will, Justine. No one can understand it. It was just Gwen's time to fly away home.
F	JUSTINE	Gwen died today.
M	PHIL	What? Are you kiddin? What for?
F	JUSTINE	Parasite. Somethin' she ate.
M	PHIL	You okay?
F	JUSTINE	Where were you this afternoon?
M	PHIL	Paintin' on Bovery. Why?
F	JUSTINE	What time did Bubba bring you home?
M	PHIL	We knocked off early 'bout four. Bubba had a date with a stewardess, why?
F	JUSTINE	Oh. I can't believe she's dead. I wasn't a very good friend to her.
M	PHIL	Don't say that, Teeny. 'Course you were. 'Course you were.
M	JACK	Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack Fields, your store manager. Before we open today, I just want to share some terrible and shocking news. One of our best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday. Gwen was a real class act. She had a good attitude, she had ideas. We're all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all need to collect you thoughts and remember Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll be excused from work and we'll just have to do without you. Gwen, this one's for you. Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love. He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin' around around in the sticks and the dirt and bein' one with nature. He was so fixed on the idea thateven when the clouds started rollin' in, and the sky was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'. All my thoughts turned to death. I thought of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought of how nice a person she was, so full of life and good will. If there was a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin' makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice. I thought if I died today, what would happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish girl. An adultress. A liar.
F	JUSTINE	What are we doin'?
M	HOLDEN	Makin' one out of two.
F	JUSTINE	(sighs) I haven't thought this through.
M	HOLDEN	Justine, will you leave him?
F	JUSTINE	And go where?
M	HOLDEN	Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin' I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend, a pretty one, who knows me and likes me. And they'll be so happy, they'll give me money to write my novel.
F	JUSTINE	But where will we GO?
M	HOLDEN	We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye. Only by me. I'll be immortal and then like JD Salinger I'll just vanish.
M	PHIL	Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good. We got the day off on account of the rain.
F	JUSTINE	I thought you might.
M	BUBBA	So I heard about your friend bein' dead, and all. I'm sorry.
F	JUSTINE	Yeah. She was real healthy too.
M	BUBBA	Well, at least you were with her when she went. (intense voice and look) Ain't that right? You were... with her, when she went?
F	JUSTINE	Yeah.
M	PHIL	Oh, I wish it would rain every day from here on out. Never have to paint again.
M	JACK	Hey Justine. How you holding up?
F	JUSTINE	Fine.
M	JACK	Real shocker. I decided to move Cheryl over to cosmetics. She got a little too creative on the P.A. Maybe she'll watch her P's and Q's over here. If not she's out on her but. Now you listen to Justine, sister.
M	HOLDEN	You want me to help you get stuff out of storage?
F	JUSTINE	Not right now, maybe later.
M	HOLDEN	Well, are you gonna give me a ride home? My ankle's actin' up.
F	JUSTINE	I gotta get home. Maybe Cheryl can.
F	CHERYL	What, you need a ride?
M	HOLDEN	Forget it.
F	JUSTINE	I think we gotta take a breather. I'm nervous.
M	HOLDEN	Well, can't we go to the motel?
F	JUSTINE	Not today.
M	HOLDEN	Well, let's go in the store room.
F	JUSTINE	Just be patient, Holden!
F	JUSTINE	I was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study?
M	CORNY	Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to have ya.
F	JUSTINE	Can I bring my husband?
M	CORNY	'Course! A couple that prays together stays together.
M	PHIL	What's this?
F	JUSTINE	The Holy Bible. There's one for you, and one for me.
M	PHIL	Not very light is it?
F	JUSTINE	We're goin' to Bible study. A couple that prays together, stays together.
M	PHIL	I heard it was the couple that lays together stays together.
F	JUSTINE	Well you heard wrong.
F	JUSTINE	Cheryl? You think you can take this one?
F	CHERYL	Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're gonna make you pretty. Now how do you like your hair?
M	CUSTOMER	Wait, you gonna do my hair?
F	CHERYL	No, I just need to know if that's your usual way of wearing it all big and high. If it is then I'll just put more makeup on your chin to off-set. Now, you're gonna want to take a whole bottle of this home wtih you. It's got quite alot of ingredients in it so you're getting a good deal. It's got Ginco extract in it, do you know what that is?
M	CUSTOMER	No. It's extract of the Ginco and it makes your skin real slick so that any liquid will roll right off, be it water or lemon juice or urine. I'll put that in a bag for you.
F	JUSTINE	Phil, what the hell are you doin'? We're gonna be late for Bible study. You're stoned, you got paint in your hair, would you just get in the shower?
M	PHIL	I completely didn't remember...
F	JUSTINE	Get in the shower.
M	BUBBA	Workin' on your spiritual life?
F	JUSTINE	Yeah, I guess.
M	BUBBA	Ain't that a hoot and a holler. What do you mean?
M	BUBBA	I saw you, Justine.
F	JUSTINE	Saw me what?
M	BUBBA	I saw you. We got some things to talk about, you and me. You come by my place after work. If you knwo what's good for ya.
M	PHIL	Hey. Where's Bubba?
F	JUSTINE	He left.
M	PHIL	Well, I'm ready. Let's go.
M	PHIL	I don't know what to say about Jesus. I'm stoned.
F	JUSTINE	Just let the other people do the talking.
M	PHIL	Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine.
F	JUSTINE	Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us.
M	CORNY	Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad you could make it!
F	JUSTINE	Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.
M	CORNY	Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good discussion going tonight. If man is made in God's image, what does that say about God?
M	PHIL	Yeah, that sounds like a good one.
F	JUSTINE	Phil, come with me to the car.
M	PHIL	What?
F	JUSTINE	Come with me to the car, I gotta get somethin'. What's goin' on?
F	JUSTINE	Just get in the car. Get in the car, Phil.
M	PHIL	What the hell?
F	JUSTINE	I don't want to go to Bible study.
M	PHIL	Why not?
F	JUSTINE	Because I don't want to. Now, can we please just get out of here?
M	PHIL	Justine, this is embarassing. We're runnin' away from Bible study like a couple of Devil worshippers.
F	JUSTINE	I don't care. I'm not in the mood.
M	PHIL	You are freakin' me out, man. Why?
F	JUSTINE	Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is why.
M	PHIL	You just said a few minutes ago they'll forgive us.
F	JUSTINE	Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So can we please just get the shit outta here?
M	PHIL	I'm never goin' back to Bible study again.
F	JUSTINE	I don't care, fine by me.
M	CUSTOMER	I think I look too white, don't you think?
F	CHERYL	I'm just tryin' to match your face with your hair, I was thinkin' you're not white enough.
M	CUSTOMER	I think I look kinda wierd.
F	CHERYL	Well, the first rule of fashion is that you have to look wierd. What I'm doing here has come straight from France.
M	CUSTOMER	Oh.
F	CHERYL	It's called circ du face, meaning circus of the face and it's all the rage with the Frenchies.
M	CUSTOMER	Well, you're the professoinal.
F	CHERYL	That's right.
M	CORNY	Justine, what happened to you? I looked up and I saw you two drivin' off like vampires in the night.
F	JUSTINE	Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.
M	CORNY	You coulda looked off your neighbor. It's a church, you know. You can't make water without bumpin' your nut on a bible.
F	JUSTINE	Oh. Well, we felt bad.
M	CORNY	Do you like it?
F	JUSTINE	I can't go.
M	HOLDEN	What?
F	JUSTINE	I can't go today. There's something important I need to tend to.
M	HOLDEN	I thought you said we'd go today.
F	JUSTINE	Well, something came up.
M	HOLDEN	What came up?
F	JUSTINE	Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's found out about us.
M	HOLDEN	I'm starting to wonder if you even want to go. I'm startin' to think you don't get me.
F	JUSTINE	Well, maybe I don't get you.
M	HOLDEN	You do, you do get me you just don't want to me 'cause I'm too intensified for you! Justine, who cares, who cares if someone finds out. We don't have to live like this, Justine. I know what it's like to go home every night and feel like you're hidin' out. We can leave all this behind...
F	JUSTINE	That's easy for you to say, Holden, you are not married.
M	HOLDEN	You just, you just gonna give up?! You gonna go crawlin' back?!
F	JUSTINE	Holden, you are gonna get us caught!
M	HOLDEN	You're so fucking afraid it makes me sick. Don't give up on us.
F	JUSTINE	I won't.
F	JUSTINE	I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?
M	HOLDEN	Okay. Good luck on your important thing.
F	JUSTINE	Thanks.
M	BUBBA	Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! Back in your corner! Back in your corner, Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'.
F	JUSTINE	Why?
M	BUBBA	You know why.
F	JUSTINE	Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open. Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work. The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer Bubba's image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do. Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle.
F	JUSTINE	Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.
M	BUBBA	But don't you see? This is my chance, for liberation.
F	JUSTINE	But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness. There's just no way.
M	BUBBA	I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.
F	JUSTINE	Why?
M	BUBBA	He's my best friend. I can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big. He's a cuckhold.
F	JUSTINE	You wanna cuckhold him yourself!
M	BUBBA	Well that's different. That isn't about him. That's about my salvation. Look, you've got your choice to make. Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart. Or have sex with me right now.
F	JUSTINE	Oh god! There was someone in the window! Did you not see?
M	BUBBA	You're paranoid.
F	JUSTINE	I gotta go.
M	BUBBA	Phil is never gonna find out about any of this. Don't fret. (the dog is still
F	JUSTINE	Get this damn dog away from me!
M	BUBBA	You're lookin' at a free man, Justine. A free man.
F	JUSTINE	Great. Good for you.
M	BUBBA	Thank you. (Yelling at dog again.)
M	PHIL	I'm nervous.
F	JUSTINE	You're nervous? Why?
M	PHIL	'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup, that's why. What if I can't do it?
F	JUSTINE	You can do it.
M	PHIL	You know, If you said you'd help me I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna be on your lunch hour anyway.
F	JUSTINE	Okay.
M	PHIL	You didn't even say nothing about the TV bein' fixed.
F	JUSTINE	Oh. Is it? Thanks.
M	PHIL	You're welcome.
M	JACK	Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you talked to Holden lately? He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives. I know you two are friends.
F	JUSTINE	We're not friends.
M	JACK	You eat lunch together every day.
F	JUSTINE	No, we don't.
M	JACK	Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is lookin' for him.
F	JUSTINE	Oh my god. What are you doin'?
M	HOLDEN	You're a hooker, you hooker.
F	JUSTINE	I saw you. You followed me.
M	HOLDEN	So, how many guys you gettin' with? You gettin' with every guy in the state?
F	JUSTINE	No, Holden, this is all because of you. He had me over a barrel. If I didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us!
M	HOLDEN	I'm so alone!
F	JUSTINE	You've gotta get a hold of yourself! Are you drunk?
M	HOLDEN	Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every day until the day I die! What do you care?! You jump on any pecker that's put in front of you!
F	JUSTINE	It's not what you think.
M	HOLDEN	I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.
F	JUSTINE	Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me after work.
M	HOLDEN	Where you goin'?
F	JUSTINE	I gotta help Phil with his sperm.
M	HOLDEN	What?
F	JUSTINE	Just go. Go!
M	HOLDEN	I can't share you, Justine! Maybe with one man but not with a whole bunch of 'em!
F	JUSTINE	Great.
M	NURSE	Mr. Last? Would you come with me?
M	PHIL	Wish me luck.
F	JUSTINE	Good luck, honey.
M	BUBBA	Knock 'em dead, partner. (Justine and Bubba watch Phil walk into one of the rooms) You look nice.
F	JUSTINE	No, I don't.
M	BUBBA	I know you're angry and I can figure why. But, from where I stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing.
F	JUSTINE	Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it.
M	BUBBA	Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine.
F	JUSTINE	Bubba, I mean it.
M	BUBBA	Let me just ask you one thing. How do I stack up against Phil? You know, how do I stack up where it counts?
M	NURSE	Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request for your presence. Who's there?
F	JUSTINE	It's Justine. (gets into the room)
M	PHIL	C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I need help.
F	JUSTINE	You've never done it on your own?
M	PHIL	Not in a place like this! Not where I have to hand over the results! Just, let me hold your boob.
F	JUSTINE	What's wrong with you? You look like death.
F	JUSTINE	My stomach's crampin'. I feel sore.
F	CHERYL	Is it your period?
F	JUSTINE	Nah, it's stress.
F	CHERYL	This job is stressful. I'm breaking out.
F	JUSTINE	You're breakin' out 'cause you put so much makeup on your face.
F	CHERYL	Maybe you're pregnant.
F	JUSTINE	
M	HOLDEN	You know, sometimes, I think to myself, at least it can't get any worse. But it can. I can worse. As long as you can say you've hit rock bottom you can.
F	JUSTINE	Oh my god, Blackberries.
M	HOLDEN	A blind man can go deaf. A widow can lose her children. Babies starve and they never get food. They never get any food. They just come into the world and they die.
F	JUSTINE	Calm down, Holden!
M	HOLDEN	I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I was a hooker like you. I could calm down all over town.
F	JUSTINE	Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.
M	HOLDEN	I know you're not. I'm in agony.
F	JUSTINE	Why?
M	HOLDEN	What do you mean 'why'? I thought you hated your life.
F	JUSTINE	I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You are really depressed.
M	HOLDEN	I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal the money whatever it takes. You just, just whatever you want as long as it's you and me. Please don't forsake me Justine.
F	JUSTINE	Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere;
F	JUSTINE	I realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I'd have to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops.
F	JUSTINE	How much are the blackberries?
M	BLACKBERRY MAN	A tin for two dollars, miss. (gives her the blackberries) There you go.
F	JUSTINE	Thank you.
F	JUSTINE	Have a blackberry.
M	HOLDEN	We need a plan. We can't keep livin' day to day. We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick....
F	JUSTINE	Have a blackberry, Holden!
M	HOLDEN	But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're sweet. If I could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the answer. I gotta do. But If I ever do, I end up thinking about it instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine pushes the blackberry he's about to eat away from his mouth) What...? What was that for?
F	JUSTINE	They looked dirty. I, I think I saw a bug in them or something.
F	JUSTINE	I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well, I think he's mentally ill. He has this idea in his head that we've had some sort of affair. Which is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, and I just think he would be better off in a place where people, professionals, could take care of him. Otherwise, he's just gonna get himself in trouble. What are you doin' in here? What's that?
F	JUSTINE	It's a home pregnancy test.
M	PHIL	Why you takin' it?
F	JUSTINE	'Cause I still haven't gotten my period.
M	PHIL	What's it say?
F	JUSTINE	Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could you give me a minute please?
M	PHIL	I wanna be here when you find out. Okay. The little plastic doohickey's turnin' blue. What's that mean?
F	JUSTINE	Blue?
M	PHIL	Bright blue.
F	JUSTINE	It means I'm pregnant.
M	PHIL	ALRIGHT!
M	PHIL	I knew it. Waste of time going to that sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna have ourselves a baby.
F	JUSTINE	Maybe.
M	PHIL	And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna bring Bubba. You can bring some of your friends from work. Or Bible study guy. Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead.
F	JUSTINE	The test could be wrong, Phil. It's a little early to be havin' a party.
M	PHIL	Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't seem too excited.
F	JUSTINE	No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby...
M	PHIL	Don't think negative. Think positive. We could have ourselves a tiny Phil. Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have a tiny weeny Teeny. Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby?
M	PHIL	What do you mean? Everything's gonna change.
F	JUSTINE	Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's really gonna change? What do ya mean?
M	HOLDEN	
M	WOMAN	Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the call of Jean Worther. I'm calling from the Holland County psychiatric hospital.
M	MOTHER	Who was it, Tom?
M	HOLDEN	It was a wrong number.
M	JACK	Either of you seen Holden? Boy is out on his ass!
F	CHERYL	Justine, somethin's goin' on. Something is definately happening.
F	JUSTINE	Go find out.
F	CHERYL	It's big. It's very big.
F	JUSTINE	C'mon Cheryl, I'm gonna kill you.
F	CHERYL	Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe. They blew the thing open with a gun.
F	JUSTINE	Oh my god.
F	CHERYL	Not only that but the cops know who did it.
F	JUSTINE	Who?
F	CHERYL	Somebody who works here.
F	JUSTINE	Cheryl!
F	CHERYL	Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his cashier key in the door.
F	JUSTINE	Oh my god.
F	CHERYL	They can't find him though. They say he robbed his folks too. You in on it?
F	JUSTINE	What?! No!
F	CHERYL	I know you two played hookie in the store room. I never rat on ya, I've done some things myself. But, still. You in on it?
F	JUSTINE	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
F	CHERYL	Suit yourself.
M	CORNY	Justine. Can we talk to you for a second?
M	JACK	Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat.
M	CORNY	Justine, you like workin' at the Retail Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize that by makin' some silly error in judgement would ya?
M	JACK	Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe last night. Did you have anything to do with it?
F	JUSTINE	No. I don't know anything.
M	CORNY	'Cause we know you're pretty tight with Holden.
F	JUSTINE	I hardly know him.
M	CORNY	I've seen you in the store room with him Justine. On many the occasion. I think you know him pretty well.
F	JUSTINE	I don't know anything.
M	HOLDEN	Justine! Justine!
M	HOLDEN	I did it! I finally did somethin'!
F	JUSTINE	Holden, the police are lookin' for you!
M	HOLDEN	Oh, who cares? I'm proud of myself. Fuck them, Fuck all of them!
F	JUSTINE	Hey! They think that I'm in on it, too! Corny's got a camera in that storage room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's been watchin' us the whole time.
M	HOLDEN	Well, we're outta here! Justine, I got over twenty thousand dollars! I got a gun, what else?!
F	JUSTINE	I'm gettin' all goosey. I think I'm gonna crash. (takes a right turn and stops the car) I'm pregnant, Holden.
M	HOLDEN	It's my baby.
F	JUSTINE	Not necessarily.
M	HOLDEN	Yes, it is. You know it is.
F	JUSTINE	Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby on the run.
M	HOLDEN	Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise a baby here. You know that. Justine. You hate your husband. You hate your job. You love me, so let's go.
F	JUSTINE	I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my things and I'd have to get more money.
M	HOLDEN	Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the motel and wait for you. Just be there by noon. This is all going too fast.
M	HOLDEN	Justine, what have you got to lose?
F	JUSTINE	Nothin'.
M	HOLDEN	So be there by noon.
F	JUSTINE	Okay.
M	HOLDEN	I love you, Justine. This is all gonna work out. I know it. I almost forgot. This is a story of your life. You inspired me. (they kiss and Holden gets out of Hey Teeny!
F	JUSTINE	Hey.
M	PHIL	We were gettin' worried about ya!
F	JUSTINE	Sorry.
M	BUBBA	Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this is Justine.
F	JUSTINE	Hi.
M	LIBERTA	Hi.
M	BUBBA	Congratulations, on your expectation.
F	JUSTINE	Thanks.
M	LIBERTA	Do you think it's a girl or a boy?
M	PHIL	Doesn't matter. As long as it plays quarterback for the Cowboys.
M	BUBBA	Well, I hear Senor Tuna callin'. (phone
M	PHIL	that's not right. What's that supposed to mean? Hey look. No. You don't know shit okay. Justine's pregnant. You got that? Well, look you better check your records again, pal, then call me! (hangs up) Some doctor says my sperm's no good. Does that mean Justine's not pregnant?
M	BUBBA	No. That just means they got it wrong, is all. They don't know everything.
F	JUSTINE	They just got it wrong, so...
M	PHIL	Looks like that wind's pickin' up again.
F	JUSTINE	How it all came down to this, only the devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left, the motel was down the road to my right. I closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future. On my left I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and quiet whisperings. and burning secrets that won't ever die away. And on my right, what could I picture? The blue sky, the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, never ending nothing.
F	CHERYL	Hey Justine.
F	JUSTINE	I know where you can find him.
M	JACK	Holden? He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll be there till noon.
M	JACK	You done good. You're a good girl.
M	PHIL	Hey.
F	JUSTINE	Hey.
M	PHIL	What's going on in the bedroom? Looks like a twister hit it.
F	JUSTINE	Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.
M	PHIL	I thought we were robbed. Why aren't you at work?
F	JUSTINE	They gave me the day off.
M	PHIL	Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?
F	JUSTINE	No. JACK Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed. The important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one's for you Holden. I thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies....
F	JUSTINE	What?
M	BUBBA	I was just at your house and the mail came. Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card company. And F&$%. Please don't tell him about us, Justine. Please. Please. I love Phil. I love him more than myself. Please have mercy on me.
F	JUSTINE	Hey Phil.
M	PHIL	Have you been sleepin' around behind my back?
F	JUSTINE	What?
M	PHIL	I said, have you been sleepin' around behind my back?
F	JUSTINE	
M	PHIL	Why? Why?
F	JUSTINE	I don't know why.
M	PHIL	Don't you love me? Don't you love me at all?
F	JUSTINE	You're the only man alive that I love.
M	PHIL	Oh god. Please don't tell me it's not my baby. It's your baby.
M	PHIL	Are you sure?
F	JUSTINE	It is. I swear. I swear to God.
M	PHIL	Who is he?
F	JUSTINE	It doesn't matter.
M	PHIL	Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?
F	JUSTINE	Yes.
M	PHIL	Yeah, I know who it was. It was that Bible guy, wasn't it? The Nazarine. That's why you were actin' so spooked.
F	JUSTINE	Yeah, yeah.
M	PHIL	I'm gonna beat his ass.
F	JUSTINE	Don't.
M	PHIL	You're gettin' all swollen. I'm sorry I hit you, baby.
F	JUSTINE	I'm sorry, Phil.
M	PHIL	I need to get stoned.
F	JUSTINE	Okay. Get stoned.
M	PHIL	I just gotta escape, you know. You ever feel like that? Like you gotta escape?
F	JUSTINE	What are those?
F	CHERYL	Fake eyelashes. Extra long.
F	JUSTINE	Just do it normal for once?
F	CHERYL	You want me to make the other cheek purple to even it out?
F	JUSTINE	No.
F	CHERYL	D'you hear about Corny? He was goin' home after Bible study last night and two beefy guys with painted faces pulled up in a truck and jumped him.
F	JUSTINE	That's terrible.
F	JUSTINE	That day I read the story Holden wrote for me. It was kinda different from the other one, but kinda the same. It was about a woman who was put upon. Whose job was a prison, and whose life had lost all meaning. Other people don't get her, especially her husband. One day she meets a boy who is also put upon, and they fall in love. After spending their whole lives not getting got, with one look they get eachother completely. In the end, the boy and the girl run away together in the wilderness, never to be heard from again.
