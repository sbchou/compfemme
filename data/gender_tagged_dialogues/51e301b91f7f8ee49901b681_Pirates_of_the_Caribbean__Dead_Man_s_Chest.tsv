M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Will...!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Why is this happening?
M	WILL TURNER	I don't know. You look beautiful.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	His Lord now... actually.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. Arrest her.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	On what charges?
M	WILL TURNER	No!
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	*What are the charges?*
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.
M	WILL TURNER	Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	*Captain* Jack Sparrow.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.
M	GIBBS	Fifteen men on a dead man's chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! TURKISH PRISON
M	JACK SPARROW	Sorry, mate.
M	JACK SPARROW	Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn't think so.
M	GIBBS	Not *quite* according to plan.
M	JACK SPARROW	Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
M	GIBBS	You got what you went in for, then?
M	JACK SPARROW	Mm-hmm!
M	GIBBS	Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it.
M	LEECH	And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic.
M	MARTY	And the hurricane!
M	CREW	Aye.
M	GIBBS	All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
M	JACK SPARROW	Shiny?
M	GIBBS	Aye, shiny.
M	JACK SPARROW	Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?
M	COTTON'S PARROT	Awk! Walk the plank!
M	JACK SPARROW	What did the bird say?
M	LEECH	Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there.
M	JACK SPARROW	Ohhh!
M	GIBBS	Know that don't do no good.
M	JACK SPARROW	It does me.
M	MARTY	It's a key!
M	JACK SPARROW	No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.
M	[Among the crew:	Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat]
M	JACK SPARROW	Gentlemen, what do keys do?
M	LEECH	Keys... unlock... *things*?
M	GIBBS	And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
M	JACK SPARROW	No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
M	GIBBS	So - We're going after this key!
M	JACK SPARROW	You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?
M	MARTY	So... Do we have a heading?
M	JACK SPARROW	Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction.
M	GIBBS	Cap'n?
M	JACK SPARROW	Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, ?oy/?quick, hey!
M	MARTY	Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er.
M	GIBBS	Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
M	GUARD	Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Those won't be necessary. The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
M	WILL TURNER	More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	We've had dealings in the past. And we've each left our mark... on the other.
M	WILL TURNER	What mark did he leave on you?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.
M	WILL TURNER	Recover. At the point of a sword?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	*Bargain*!
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Letters of Marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.
M	WILL TURNER	Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish. Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and your fiancée face the hangman's noose.
M	WILL TURNER	So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	The Black Pearl?
M	WILL TURNER	The property you want that he possesses.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	A ship? Hardly. The item in question's considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times. A compass. Ah, you know it. Bring back that Compass, or there's no deal. BLACK PEARL
M	JACK SPARROW	Why is the rum always gone?
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh! *That's* why.
M	JACK SPARROW	As you were, gents.
M	JACK SPARROW	Ah!
M	JACK SPARROW	Bootstrap. Bill Turner.
M	JACK SPARROW	Is this a dream?
M	JACK SPARROW	I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.
M	JACK SPARROW	I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.
M	JACK SPARROW	Your son.
M	JACK SPARROW	And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
M	JACK SPARROW	Who?
M	JACK SPARROW	Ah. So it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh?
M	JACK SPARROW	It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment -
M	JACK SPARROW	Technic -
M	JACK SPARROW	Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re -
M	JACK SPARROW	Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
M	JACK SPARROW	On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty, I want movement!
M	JACK SPARROW	*I want movement!*
M	GIBBS	Lift the skin up!
M	JACK SPARROW	All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!
M	GIBBS	Do we have a heading?
M	JACK SPARROW	Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh! Euh!
M	GIBBS	Which port?
M	JACK SPARROW	Didn't say port. I said land. Any land.
M	JACK SPARROW	Agh!
M	GIBBS	Jack's hat! Bring 'er about!
M	JACK SPARROW	No no! Leave it! Run!
M	GIBBS	Back to your stations! The lot o' ya!
M	GIBBS	Jack?
M	JACK SPARROW	Shhh!
M	GIBBS	For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us?
M	JACK SPARROW	Nothing.
M	TURKISH FISHERMAN	Heh-heh-heh.?tupayHey! ?Fo ?pes ?sa ?kapazun kapitan ?de ?la ?mezande, huh?
M	GREEK FISHERMAN	?Etora.
M	GREEK FISHERMAN	Ah! ?Vangas ?da ?eroro ###
M	CARRUTHERS	Here now. He can't be here.
M	CARRUTHERS	Mister Swann, -
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want with that?
M	WILL TURNER	Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us will be dropped.
M	WILL TURNER	Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him?
M	WILL TURNER	Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to marry you.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Properly?
M	WILL TURNER	Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I'll wait for you.
M	WILL TURNER	Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
M	WEATHERED SAILOR	*Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four dubloons. Heard he was dead.
M	HALF-BLIND FISHERMAN	Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk with a smile on his face. Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow... will turn up in Singapore.
F	GISELLE	Jack Sparrow!
F	SCARLETT	I haven't seen 'im in a month.
F	GISELLE	When you find him, will you give him a message?
M	SHRIMPER	Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black sails.
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	beach
M	SHRIMPER	My brother will take you ashore.
M	WILL TURNER	What's wrong? The beach is right there.
M	SHRIMPER'S BROTHER	?: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux.
M	WILL TURNER	What?
M	SHRIMPER'S BROTHER	?: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux, j'avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur.
M	WILL TURNER	Jack! Jack Sparrow!
M	WILL TURNER	Marty! Cotton! Anybody?
M	COTTON'S PARROT	Awk!
M	WILL TURNER	Ah! A familiar face!
M	COTTON'S PARROT	Rawk! Don't eat me!
M	WILL TURNER	I'm not gonna eat you.
M	COTTON'S PARROT	Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk!
M	WILL TURNER	Gibbs.
M	WILL TURNER	Euh! Unh! Ya! Come on! Let's go! Euh! Ya! Come on! Who wants it? Unh! I could do this all day! Euh! Euh! Hah!
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	throne Hurry-hurry tan daga!
M	WILL TURNER	Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say I'm glad to see you!
M	WILL TURNER	Jack! It's me! Will Turner!
M	JACK SPARROW	?: Wa-say kohn. Een dah-lah. Eeseepi.
M	CANNIBAL CROWD	Eeseepi.
M	WILL TURNER	Tell 'em to let me down.
M	JACK SPARROW	Kay-lay lam. Lam piki-piki. Lam eensy weensy. Lam say-say... eunuchy. Snip-snip.
M	CANNIBAL CROWD	Ahhh... eunuchy!
M	WILL TURNER	Jack! The Compass! That's all I need, Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help *you*. She faces the gallows!
M	JACK SPARROW	Say-say lam shoop-shoop sha smalay-lama shoo-koo. Savvy? Ball licky-licky.
M	CANNIBAL CROWD	Ball licky-licky!
M	CANNIBAL CROWD	?Boom-shoo-boom, ?boom-shoo-boom, ?boom-shoo-boom...
M	JACK SPARROW	Save me!
M	WILL TURNER	Jack, what did you tell them? No! What about Elizabeth? *Jack...!*
M	PRISONERS	...we don't bite...Come on...
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Why don't you tell me what's happening?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	No! Will has gone to find Jack!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	He's a better man than you give him credit for.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
M	MERCER	Evening, Governor. Shame, huh? He was carryin' this. It's a letter to the King. It's from *you*.
M	MERCER	Where is she? EITC headquarters
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Then what is?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	I'm listening.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	I'm listening *intently*.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Do explain.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	So I did. A marriage interrupted. Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	These aren't going to Jack.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations.
M	RAGETTI	Well I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail.
M	PINTEL	And I say... it was me bein' *clever*. Ain't that right, poochie?
M	RAGETTI	?: Well how'dya know it ?weren't/?wasn't divine providence what inspired you to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship.
M	PINTEL	It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care?
M	RAGETTI	Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
M	PINTEL	You know you can't read.
M	RAGETTI	It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
M	PINTEL	Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*! *That's* a mark against ya! Look! There it is!
M	RAGETTI	What's got into *'im*?
M	PINTEL	Must've seen a catfish. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
M	RAGETTI	Stupid mongrel!
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	beach
M	PINTEL	Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha...
M	PINTEL	It's ours for the taking!
M	RAGETTI	Tide's comin', that should help. Well, salvagin' is saving, in a manner of speaking.
M	PINTEL	There's the truth of *it*! ###
M	RAGETTI	Suppose we be'er... save it as soon as we can. What with our souls in such a vulnerable state, and all.
M	PINTEL	Amen to that.
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	throne
M	JACK SPARROW	Thank you.
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	cages
M	WILL TURNER	Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief.
M	GIBBS	Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief.
M	WILL TURNER	So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
M	GIBBS	Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
M	GIBBS	?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
M	WILL TURNER	Where's the rest of the crew?
M	GIBBS	These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here.
M	GIBBS	The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end... when the drums stop.
M	WILL TURNER	Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we?
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	throne
M	JACK SPARROW	?No/?Oup! No no! ?Oy!/?Wait! No no! More wood! Big fire! *Big* fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on!
M	JACK SPARROW	?Oy!/?Boy! Maboogie snickel-snickel. Tout de suite! Come on! More wood!
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	Jack
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh bugger.
M	JACK SPARROW	Little seasoning. Eh?
M	JACK SPARROW	Well done.
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	cages
M	GIBBS	Put your legs through, start to climb! Agh!
M	WILL TURNER	Come on men! It'll take all ?of-us/?the-rest to crew the Black Pearl!
M	LEECH	Actually, you won't need everyone. 'Bout six would do! Ohhh... dear.
M	WILL TURNER	Hurry!
M	WILL TURNER	Stop!
M	LEECH	Shhh!
M	?WILL TURNER	?Move!
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	throne
M	CANNIBAL CROWD	Ahhh! Fye-fye!
M	JACK SPARROW	Well, go on! Go get them! Hay ala!
M	CANNIBAL CROWD	Hay ala!
M	JACK SPARROW	No! No no! Oy! No no!
M	JACK SPARROW	Not good.
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	cage
M	WILL TURNER	Cut it loose! Find a rock!
M	WILL TURNER	Roll the cage!
M	WILL TURNER	Lift the cage! Hurry!
M	GIBBS	Come on, men! Lift it like a lady's skirt!
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	hut [Jack is running off with the bamboo pole tied to his back]
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	cage
M	GIBBS	This way, lads!
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	Jack
M	?CANNIBAL BOY	Da litozo! Da litozo!
M	CANNIBAL WOMAN	?A-geev-nee. Uh-boogie?
M	JACK SPARROW	Bugger.
M	CANNIBAL ISLAND	beach
M	PINTEL	?Pull-loose/?Unloose the mooring lines! The mooring lines!
M	RAGETTI	?Thief/?Thing! Little hairy ?thief/?thing! Give it back! Don't bite it!
M	PINTEL	?Unloose the mooring lines!
M	RAGETTI	He's got me eye! He won't give it back!
M	PINTEL	Well, how'd you get it back last time?
M	GIBBS	Excellent work! Work's half done!
M	PINTEL	We done it for you! Knowin' you'd be comin' back for us.
M	GIBBS	?Make/?Making ?ready ?to?sail/?cast-off ###, boy.
M	WILL TURNER	What about Jack? I won't leave without him.
M	JACK SPARROW	Hey!
M	WILL TURNER	Time to go.
M	GIBBS	*Cast off those lines!*
M	JACK SPARROW	Good doggie! ?Doggie.
M	JACK SPARROW	*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost -
M	JACK SPARROW	...Captain Jack... Sparrow.
M	GIBBS	Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea.
M	JACK SPARROW	Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
M	GIBBS	Uh, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
M	JACK SPARROW	I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot *something*.
M	WILL TURNER	Jack.
M	JACK SPARROW	Ah.
M	WILL TURNER	Elizabeth is in danger.
M	JACK SPARROW	Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
M	WILL TURNER	She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*!
M	JACK SPARROW	There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
M	WILL TURNER	I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.
M	JACK SPARROW	Mister Gibbs!
M	GIBBS	Cap'n.
M	JACK SPARROW	We have a need to travel upriver.
M	GIBBS	By need, d'you mean a... trifling need, ?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy?
M	JACK SPARROW	No, a... resolute and unyielding need. What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
M	JACK SPARROW	William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*.
M	WILL TURNER	You want me to find this?
M	JACK SPARROW	No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy?
M	WILL TURNER	This... is going to save Elizabeth?
M	JACK SPARROW	How much do you know about Davy Jones?
M	WILL TURNER	Not much.
M	JACK SPARROW	Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
M	BELLAMY	What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other.
M	BURSAR	It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted.
M	BELLAMY	Is it now? 'N' you?
M	QUARTERMASTER	The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it.
M	BURSAR	I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it.
M	QUARTERMASTER	No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back!
M	BELLAMY	Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked.
M	WILL TURNER	Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
M	GIBBS	Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken!
M	GIBBS	They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things.
M	WILL TURNER	And the key will spare him that?
M	GIBBS	Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... *Her*.
M	WILL TURNER	Her?
M	GIBBS	Aye.
M	BAYOU	Tia's shack
M	JACK SPARROW	No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before.
M	GIBBS	I'll watch your back.
M	JACK SPARROW	It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat.
M	GIBBS	Mind the boat.
M	?WILL TURNER	Mind the boat.
M	PINTEL	Mind the boat.
M	MARTY	Mind the boat.
M	COTTON'S PARROT	Awk! Mind the boat!
M	TIA DALMA	Jack Sparrow!
M	JACK SPARROW	Tia Dalma!
M	TIA DALMA	I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day.
M	TIA DALMA	You. You have a touch of... destiny about *you*, William Turner.
M	WILL TURNER	You know me?
M	TIA DALMA	You want to know *me*.
M	JACK SPARROW	There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
M	JACK SPARROW	I thought *I* knew you.
M	TIA DALMA	Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
M	JACK SPARROW	Come.
M	TIA DALMA	What... service... may I do you? Hmmm? You know I demand payment.
M	JACK SPARROW	I brought payment.
M	JACK SPARROW	Look!
M	JACK SPARROW	An undead monkey! Top that!
M	GIBBS	No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
M	TIA DALMA	The payment is fair.
M	JACK SPARROW	We're looking for this. And what it goes to.
M	TIA DALMA	The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis?
M	JACK SPARROW	Maybe. Why?
M	TIA DALMA	Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?
M	GIBBS	What *is* inside?
M	PINTEL	Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
M	RAGETTI	Nothing... bad, I hope.
M	TIA DALMA	You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men.
M	WILL TURNER	What vexes all men?
M	TIA DALMA	What, indeed.
M	GIBBS	The sea?
M	PINTEL	Sums!
M	RAGETTI	Dichotomy of good and evil.
M	JACK SPARROW	A *woman*.
M	TIA DALMA	A wo-*man*. He fell in love.
M	GIBBS	No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with.
M	TIA DALMA	Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.
M	WILL TURNER	What... exactly did he put into the chest?
M	TIA DALMA	Him heart.
M	RAGETTI	Literally, or figuratively?
M	PINTEL	He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest! Could he?
M	TIA DALMA	It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times.
M	WILL TURNER	You knew this.
M	JACK SPARROW	I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!
M	TIA DALMA	Let me see your hand.
M	GIBBS	Uhhh! The black spot!
M	JACK SPARROW	My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
M	TIA DALMA	I am justMy little ###, where are you? ###
M	TIA DALMA	Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you...
M	JACK SPARROW	Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
M	TIA DALMA	Yes?
M	JACK SPARROW	Is the... jar of dirt going to help?
M	TIA DALMA	If you don' want it, give it back.
M	JACK SPARROW	No.
M	TIA DALMA	Den it helps.
M	WILL TURNER	It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
M	TIA DALMA	A touch... of destiny!
M	WILL TURNER	That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.
M	JACK SPARROW	Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her.
M	GIBBS	Must've run afoul of the reef.
M	JACK SPARROW	So what's your plan, then?
M	WILL TURNER	I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
M	JACK SPARROW	And if there are crewmen?
M	WILL TURNER	I cut down anyone in my path.
M	JACK SPARROW	I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
M	RAGETTI	Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!
M	JACK SPARROW	Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!
M	RAGETTI	Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!
M	JACK SPARROW	Douse the lamps.
M	SCUTTLED SHIP	before attack
M	WOUNDED SAILOR	...up the...
M	WILL TURNER	Sailor!
M	WOUNDED SAILOR	...the stench...capsized...
M	WILL TURNER	Sailor!
M	WOUNDED SAILOR	...bring a...
M	WILL TURNER	There's no use. You've run aground.
M	WOUNDED SAILOR	No! Beneath us! Foul breath!
M	WILL TURNER	Hey! Hey!
M	GREENBEARD	Down on your marrowbones, and pray.
M	WILL TURNER	Get back! Back!
M	SCUTTLED SHIP	after attack
M	MACCUS	Five men still alive. The rest have moved on.
M	DAVY JONES	Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you... an escape-uh.
M	CHAPLAIN	Don't listen to him!
M	DAVY JONES	Do you not fear death?
M	CHAPLAIN	I'll take my chances, Sir.
M	DAVY JONES	To the depths.
M	DAVY JONES	Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?
M	HELMSMAN	I - I will, serve.
M	DAVY JONES	?Grand.
M	DAVY JONES	*You* are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?
M	WILL TURNER	Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
M	DAVY JONES	What is your purpose here?
M	WILL TURNER	Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt.
M	DAVY JONES	Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh.
M	DAVY JONES	You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. *That* was our agreement.
M	JACK SPARROW	Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
M	DAVY JONES	Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow?
M	JACK SPARROW	You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
M	DAVY JONES	One soul is not equal to another.
M	JACK SPARROW	Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.
M	DAVY JONES	Price? Pttt!
M	JACK SPARROW	Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
M	DAVY JONES	One hundred souls, three days-uh.
M	JACK SPARROW	You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.
M	DAVY JONES	I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!
M	JACK SPARROW	Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?
M	DAVY JONES	I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?
M	JACK SPARROW	Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
M	JACK SPARROW	Uh!
M	DAVY JONES	Three days. Three days.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh, Mr. Gibbs.
M	GIBBS	Aye.
M	JACK SPARROW	Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.
M	GIBBS	And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
M	JACK SPARROW	Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.
M	GIBBS	Ah... Tortuga!
M	JACK SPARROW	Tortuga.
M	BELLAMY	It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?
M	QUARTERMASTER	I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
M	BELLAMY	A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you.
M	BURSAR	S-S-Sir!
M	BURSAR	She wants you to... do something.
M	BELLAMY	She's tryna give a sign.
M	BELLAMY	Over there! Look for a sign!
M	QUARTERMASTER	Look there! There it is. There's the sign.
M	?BURSAR	That's seaweed.
M	QUARTERMASTER	S-Seaweed can be a sign.
M	?BURSAR	Looks like entrails.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	What's that over there?
M	GIBBS	And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
M	ELDERLY MAN	Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.
M	GIBBS	You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
M	JILTED MAN	My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
M	GIBBS	Perfect! Next!
M	ONE-ARMED MAN	Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg.
M	GIBBS	It's the crow's nest for you.
M	JACK SPARROW	I know what I want.
M	GIBBS	Next!
M	ROMANTIC MAN	Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.
M	GIBBS	Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
M	ROMANTIC MAN	Thanks very much.
M	JACK SPARROW	How we going?
M	GIBBS	Including those four? That gives us - four!
M	GIBBS	And what's *your* story?
M	NORRINGTON	My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.
M	GIBBS	Commodore?
M	NORRINGTON	No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane.
M	GIBBS	Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?
M	NORRINGTON	So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere *nice*!
M	NORRINGTON	So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
M	NORRINGTON	Or should I just kill you now?
M	JACK SPARROW	You're hired.
M	NORRINGTON	Sorry. Old habits and all that.
M	JACK SPARROW	Time to go?
M	GIBBS	Aye!
M	JACK SPARROW	Thanks, mate.
M	JACK SPARROW	Carry on.
M	NORRINGTON	Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	James Norrington. What has the world done to you?
M	BO'SUN	Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!
M	BO'SUN	Step ?to-it/?tight!
M	WILL TURNER	Step aside!
M	BO'SUN	?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself!
M	BO'SUN	Haul that weevil to his feet!
M	BO'SUN	Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em!
M	BO'SUN	Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment.
M	DAVY JONES	Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?
M	DAVY JONES	Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
M	DAVY JONES	The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own.
M	DAVY JONES	Bo'sun!
M	BO'SUN	You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!
M	WILL TURNER	I don't need your help!
M	WILL TURNER	So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	below deck
M	WILL TURNER	I've sworn no oath.
M	WILL TURNER	Not until I find this. The key.
M	WYVERN	The deadman's chest.
M	WILL TURNER	What do you know of this?
M	WYVERN	Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.
M	WILL TURNER	So the captain has the key.
M	WILL TURNER	Where *is* the key?
M	WYVERN	Hidden.
M	WILL TURNER	Where is the chest?
M	WYVERN	Hidden.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Captain Sparrow!
M	JACK SPARROW	Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I'm here to find the man I love.
M	JACK SPARROW	I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
M	JACK SPARROW	Elizabeth. Hide the rum.
M	JACK SPARROW	You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?
M	JACK SPARROW	Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Davy Jones?
M	NORRINGTON	Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman.
M	JACK SPARROW	You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
M	NORRINGTON	You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
M	JACK SPARROW	You *smell* funny.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Jack. All I want is to find Will.
M	JACK SPARROW	Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	'Course.
M	JACK SPARROW	Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	And you have a way of doing that?
M	JACK SPARROW	Well, there is a chest...
M	NORRINGTON	Oh, dear.
M	JACK SPARROW	A chest of unknown size and origin.
M	PINTEL	What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
M	RAGETTI	Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...
M	JACK SPARROW	And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including...
M	NORRINGTON	You don't actually believe him, do you?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	How do we find it?
M	JACK SPARROW	With this. My Compass... is unique.
M	NORRINGTON	"Unique" here having the meaning of broken.
M	JACK SPARROW	True enough. This Compass does not point north.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Where does it point?
M	JACK SPARROW	It points to the thing you want most in this world.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
M	JACK SPARROW	Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	To save Will?
M	JACK SPARROW	By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
M	JACK SPARROW	Mister Gibbs!
M	GIBBS	Cap'n.
M	JACK SPARROW	We have our heading. Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!
M	JACK SPARROW	Miss Swann.
M	GIBBS	
M	PINTEL	Welcome to the crew, former Commodore! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh...
M	PORT ROYAL	EITC headquarters
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it, don't you agree?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	I had you brought here because I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
M	MERCER	Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. *And* other fugitives from justice.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Including the previous owner of this sword... I believe. Our ships are in pursuit. and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Shall I remove these shackles?
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hopes never to sell.
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	deck
M	MACCUS	I wager... ten years.
M	?KOLENIKO	I'll match ten years.
M	GREENBEARD	Agreed.
M	WILL TURNER	I understand.
M	WILL TURNER	It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
M	WILL TURNER	What are they wagering?
M	WILL TURNER	So any crewman can be challenged?
M	WILL TURNER	I challenge Davy Jones.
M	DAVY JONES	I accept ?that-uh.
M	DAVY JONES	The stakes?
M	WILL TURNER	My soul. An eternity of servitude.
M	DAVY JONES	Against?
M	WILL TURNER	I want this.
M	DAVY JONES	How do you know of the key?
M	WILL TURNER	That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away.
M	DAVY JONES	What's this?
M	WILL TURNER	No! Don't do this.
M	DAVY JONES	Four fours.
M	WILL TURNER	Four fives.
M	DAVY JONES	Seven fives-uh.
M	WILL TURNER	Eight fives.
M	DAVY JONES	Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar.
M	DAVY JONES	And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port!
M	WILL TURNER	Fool. Why did you do that?
M	WILL TURNER	It was never about winning, or losing.
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	organ room
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	deck
M	WILL TURNER	It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
M	WILL TURNER	They'll know you helped me.
M	WILL TURNER	I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.
M	GIBBS	Beckett!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
M	JACK SPARROW	Agh.
M	GIBBS	Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
M	JACK SPARROW	Agh.
M	GIBBS	Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
M	JACK SPARROW	Of course. He wants the chest.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Yes, he did say something about a chest.
M	GIBBS	If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
M	JACK SPARROW	A truly discomforting notion, love.
M	GIBBS	And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard!
M	JACK SPARROW	Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Persuasion.
M	JACK SPARROW	Friendly?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Decidedly not.
M	JACK SPARROW	Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Jack, the Letters, give them back.
M	JACK SPARROW	No. Persuade me.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	You do know Will taught me how handle a sword.
M	JACK SPARROW	As I said... Persuade me.
M	NORRINGTON	It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I don't know what you mean.
M	NORRINGTON	Oh, I think you do.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all.
M	NORRINGTON	So you never wondered how your *latest* fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
M	BELLAMY	Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters.
M	WILL TURNER	Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
M	BELLAMY	And what are we running from?
M	WILL TURNER	That dress. Where did you get it?
M	BELLAMY	It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
M	WILL TURNER	That's foolish.
M	QUARTERMASTER	Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish.
M	BURSAR	It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.
M	?BELLAMY	Off the books, of course.
M	WILL TURNER	I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
M	BELLAMY	Why do you ask?
M	MESSENGER SAILOR	Captain, a ship's been spotted.
M	BELLAMY	Colors?
M	MESSENGER SAILOR	She isn't flyin' any.
M	BELLAMY	Pirates!
M	WILL TURNER	Or worse.
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	deck
M	DAVY JONES	You will watch this.
M	DAVY JONES	Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the *Kraken*!
M	WILL TURNER	I've doomed us all. It's the Flying Dutchman!
M	BURSAR	Oh, Mother Cary's chickens. What happened?
M	?QUARTERMASTER	Must've hit a reef.
M	?BELLAMY	Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard!
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	deck
M	MACCUS	The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea.
M	DAVY JONES	*I* am the sea.
M	DAVY JONES	You need time alone with your thoughts.
M	DAVY JONES	There are no survivors.
M	DAVY JONES	The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay.
M	KOLENIKO	First?
M	DAVY JONES	Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow.
M	JACK SPARROW	My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married.
M	JACK SPARROW	You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	No, thank you.
M	JACK SPARROW	Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
M	JACK SPARROW	Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	You seem very certain.
M	JACK SPARROW	One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Why doesn't your Compass work?
M	JACK SPARROW	Uh my Compass works fine.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.
M	JACK SPARROW	I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.
M	JACK SPARROW	All evidence to the contrary.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I have faith in you. Want to know why?
M	JACK SPARROW	Do tell, dearie.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.
M	JACK SPARROW	I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	I'm proud of you, Jack.
M	?GIBBS	Land ho!
M	JACK SPARROW	I want my jar of dirt.
M	PINTEL	You're pullin' too fast.
M	RAGETTI	You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
M	PINTEL	I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin.
M	RAGETTI	What, with a long A?
M	PINTEL	Aye.
M	RAGETTI	No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that.
M	PINTEL	Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken!
M	RAGETTI	It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.

M	JACK SPARROW	Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.
M	JACK SPARROW	Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Beg your pardon?
M	JACK SPARROW	Move.

M	DAVY JONES	They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.
M	MACCUS	Then trust us to act in your stead.
M	DAVY JONES	I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then!
M	MACCUS	Down!

M	ELIZABETH SWANN	It's real!
M	NORRINGTON	You actually *were* telling the truth.
M	JACK SPARROW	I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
M	WILL TURNER	With good reason!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
M	JACK SPARROW	How did you get here?
M	WILL TURNER	Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
M	JACK SPARROW	Not so easy, is it?
M	WILL TURNER	But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
M	JACK SPARROW	You do?
M	WILL TURNER	After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	What?
M	JACK SPARROW	What?
M	WILL TURNER	I was reunited with my father.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!
M	JACK SPARROW	Pretty much. Time and tide, love.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oy! What're you doing?
M	WILL TURNER	I'm gonna kill Jones.
M	JACK SPARROW	Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.
M	WILL TURNER	I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
M	NORRINGTON	I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
M	JACK SPARROW	I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
M	NORRINGTON	Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.
M	JACK SPARROW	Ah. The dark side of ambition.
M	NORRINGTON	Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Stop it!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Jack!
M	WILL TURNER	Guard the chest!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	*No*!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*!
M	PINTEL	How'd this go all screwy?
M	RAGETTI	Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.
M	PINTEL	Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny.
M	RAGETTI	Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
M	PINTEL	If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Will! *Enough!*
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Oh! Oh...! The heat!
M	NORRINGTON	By your leave, Mister Turner.

M	WILL TURNER	By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
M	NORRINGTON	Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
M	WILL TURNER	Be my guest.
M	JACK SPARROW	Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
M	NORRINGTON	Enough!
M	NORRINGTON	Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*!
M	JACK SPARROW	Still rooting for you, mate!
M	JACK SPARROW	Wup!
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh.
M	JACK SPARROW	Woah!
M	PINTEL	'Ello, Poppet. Sword!

M	HADRUS	No... That's a tree.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh, shut it.

M	JACK SPARROW	Jar of dirt!
M	WILL TURNER	Right!
M	PINTEL	Come on, Turner!
M	JACK SPARROW	Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	We're not getting out of this.
M	NORRINGTON	Not with the chest. Into the boat.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	You're mad.
M	NORRINGTON	Don't wait for me.
M	JACK SPARROW	Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
M	PINTEL	Aye!
M	HADRUS	Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands.

M	HADRUS	?Vengo ?kowmpenay ?lachay. Hey! ?Hovaya!

M	RAGETTI	You're not pulling hard enough!
M	GIBBS	Where's the Commodore?
M	JACK SPARROW	He fell behind.
M	GIBBS	My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear.
M	GIBBS	Lord almighty.?us.
M	JACK SPARROW	I'll handle this, mate.
M	JACK SPARROW	Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup!
M	JACK SPARROW	Got it!

M	DAVY JONES	Enough!
M	JACK SPARROW	Hard to starboard.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	*Hard to starboard!*
M	WILL TURNER	Brace up the foreyard!
M	GIBBS	Hard to starboard!

M	GIBBS	Aye, and we've got her!
M	WILL TURNER	We're the faster?

M	WILL TURNER	No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	What is it?
M	WILL TURNER	The Kraken. To arms!
M	?GIBBS	All guns, defend the masts!
M	WILL TURNER	?It'll ?attack the starboard. I've seen it before. ?Break out the cannons and hold for my signal.
M	WILL TURNER	Easy, boys!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Will?
M	WILL TURNER	Steady! Steady.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Will?
M	WILL TURNER	Hold. Hold...
M	PINTEL	I think we've held fire long enough.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	*Will?*
M	WILL TURNER	*Fire...*!
M	WILL TURNER	It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	There's no boats.
M	WILL TURNER	Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
M	WILL TURNER	Whatever you do, don't miss.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	As soon as you're clear.
M	GIBBS	There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
M	WILL TURNER	Then load the rum!
M	GIBBS	Aye! The rum, too!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Step to!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Oh you coward!
M	MARTY	Not good.
M	WILL TURNER	?Pull ?away!
M	GIBBS	Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it!
M	WILL TURNER	Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come on!
M	WILL TURNER	Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
M	MARTY	Did we kill it?
M	GIBBS	No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders!
M	JACK SPARROW	Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
M	GIBBS	Jack! The Pearl!
M	JACK SPARROW	She's only a ship, mate.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	He's right, we have to head for land.
M	PINTEL	'S a lot o' open wa'er.
M	RAGETTI	That's a lot o' wa'er.
M	WILL TURNER	We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
M	GIBBS	Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Thank you, Jack.
M	JACK SPARROW	We're not free yet, love.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
M	GIBBS	Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.
M	JACK SPARROW	Pirate.
M	WILL TURNER	Where's Jack?
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Go!
M	JACK SPARROW	Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!
M	JACK SPARROW	Come on... Come on...
M	JACK SPARROW	Not so bad.
M	JACK SPARROW	Oh!
M	JACK SPARROW	Hello, beastie.
M	FLYING DUTCHMAN	deck
M	DAVY JONES	Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled.
M	KOLENIKO	The captain goes down with his ship.
M	MACCUS	Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
M	DAVY JONES	Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it!
M	DAVY JONES	Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!
M	PORT ROYAL	EITC headquarters
M	MERCER	The last of our ships has returned.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	Is there any news on the chest?
M	MERCER	None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these.
M	NORRINGTON	I took the liberty of filling in my name.
M	LORD CUTLER BECKETT	If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. D'you have the Compass?
M	NORRINGTON	Better. The heart of Davy Jones.
M	BAYOU	Tia's shack
M	TIA DALMA	Against de cold... and de sorrow.
M	TIA DALMA	It's a shame. I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul.
M	WILL TURNER	Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone. Along with its captain.
M	GIBBS	Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!
M	RAGETTI	Never another like Captain Jack.
M	PINTEL	He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	He was a good man.
M	WILL TURNER	If there was anything could be done to bring him back... Elizabeth... Would you do it? Hmmm? What... would you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back ?witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl?
M	GIBBS	Aye.
M	PINTEL	Aye.
M	RAGETTI	Aye.
M	COTTON'S PARROT	Awk! Aye.
M	ELIZABETH SWANN	Yes.
M	WILL TURNER	Aye.
M	TIA DALMA	Alright. But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den... you will need a captain who knows dose waters.
M	BARBOSSA	So tell me, what's become of my ship?
