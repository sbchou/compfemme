M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BOWER (V.0.)	Where were you... when Eden was lost? Like every other kid on my block, I was in the middle of a dream, envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter. We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and... Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.
M	BOWER.(V.0.)	As the entire world watched in wonder, there were only a few, skeptical of the journey's success. Only a few... who would be right. The further we move into the ship... signs of violence CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
M	BOWER (P.O.)	Where was I... when I heard we'd lost Eden? Just like every other kid on my block... I was dreaming... of being one who would be chosen to follow. As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
F	BOWER	Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Hey...? HEY!!? Someone? A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Payton? Lieutenant... Payton? He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Bower? Bower...? The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.
F	BOWER	Bower. He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	.in the event of mild memory loss... resulting from extended- He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets
M	PUSH IN	There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return. An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the
F	BOWER	Faa-uck! Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're- Sir... whoa! PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once
M	PAYTON	Who are you?
F	BOWER	Bower. Corporal... Bower, sir. I'm the- Bower?
F	BOWER	That's right. You're waking from
M	PAYTON	Corporal?
F	BOWER	Yes, sir. This is disorientation from-
M	PAYTON	corporal... Bower.
F	BOWER	Yes. That's right, I'm-
M	PAYTON	Wanna get that fucking light out of my eyes, pal?
F	BOWER	Sorry... sir. PAYTON rubs his face with a frown.
M	PAYTON	Where... are we?
F	BOWER	We're aboard the Elysium. From what I've Elysium...? Where are we?
F	BOWER	I don't... really know. There's no power in the com and I can't even-
M	PAYTON	Where's the... rest of the crew? It's our shift? Our rotation-
F	BOWER	I believe so.
M	PAYTON	Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake us?
F	BOWER	Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing
M	PAYTON	Hit the lights, will ya?
F	BOWER	Ah... we're having some power problems-
M	PAYTON	Who woke you up?
F	BOWER	Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here... .except us.
M	PAYTON	Cold in here. BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to
F	BOWER	There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the... Dynos. Can't even open the doors.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where he is. It was empty when I woke up. None of the systems are on-line. Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or why it engaged independently-
M	PAYTON	Bower .
F	BOWER	Yeah?
M	PAYTON	Until I have two coffees you're just gonna have to repeat all this shit, so let's just idle here for a bit.
F	BOWER	Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under
M	BOWER (CONT`D)	Easy... Lieutenant. Easy.
M	PAYTON	Coffee?
F	BOWER	I'm on it.
M	PAYTON	Good man. BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.
F	BOWER	This is you, sir.
M	PAYTON	How do you know that?
F	BOWER	1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss that's-
M	PAYTON	Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM, sometimes it can take a while to get it back. PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into
F	BOWER	I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything.
M	PAYTON	Listen, the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while to get it all back. BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a
F	BOWER	What was... your last flight, sir? Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey? Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	I've gone through this before. I just can't remember why I would agree to do it again. PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a
F	BOWER	Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination.
M	PAYTON	I figured you'd tell me.
F	BOWER	Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise-
M	PAYTON	Trust me, it's not. if this is a simulation... PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Someone is taking the joke a little far. He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight's beam
F	BOWER	None of the activators are working.
M	PAYTON	Figures. We can ride two hundred thousand tons of space freighter across the galaxy without a dent in the hood, but can't get one good cup of coffee. PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.
F	BOWER	Without the mainframe, we can't connect. I don't know how we'll ever be able to- PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Oh, I- didn't even think of that. PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch.
M	PAYTON	Payton on the con. Respond? This is Lt. Payton of flight Team...? Shit-
F	BOWER	Five.
M	PAYTON	Five? How do you know that? BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON
M	PAYTON (CONT-D)	Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone awake up there? Dead static.
F	BOWER	Team Four suppose to be here for the shift rotation. Where could they be?
M	PAYTON	Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't get to us. BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.
F	BOWER	Where could he have gone? PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass
M	PAYTON	The power systems must be free-floating off blown circuits or something. The over-ride grid won't even lock in.
F	BOWER	Whatta ya think?
M	PAYTON	I think we need to find a deck of cards and call the union. Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching
F	BOWER	Somebody... is up there.
M	PAYTON	Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep re-booting after each surge. That could be anything. THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	I say we get out of here. I'd rather be up and out then stuck in the trunk. The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	We're not far from the bridge but without the circuits locked in... I don't know how we could ever get this thing open. As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door
F	BOWER	Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.
M	PAYTON	Ironic. I think it was built to protect us.
F	BOWER	Well, he got out... some how. A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Cycle is broken.
M	PAYTON	What?
F	BOWER	It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but it's not. Each revolution decreasing before starting over from the beginning. It's trying to reconnect, but it won't until it's reset.
M	PAYTON	How the hell do you know that?
F	BOWER	I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I know everything there is to know about that damn reactor.
M	PAYTON	The training stuck.
F	BOWER	And I know that... Another SHUDDER approaches.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	That's twelve revolutions, before recycling. And this one will only last- As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a
M	PAYTON	Now if we only had a monkey and a rope.
F	BOWER	Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this way. Don't you think?
M	PAYTON	Must have.
F	BOWER	It's the only way out.
M	PAYTON	I think we're better off... waiting here-
F	BOWER	For what? If the mainframe is off-line-
M	PAYTON	We're not going to be able to get to the bridge or even be able to open that door from the other side-
F	BOWER	But we can at least find out what's
M	PAYTON	Do you remember just how big this ship is, kid? We don't know where that will come out, if at all-
F	BOWER	But, we can at least try to- I can't do that.
F	BOWER	Can't do... Sir?
M	PAYTON	Listen, I have to take a handful of Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk.
F	BOWER	You're... claustrophobic?
M	PAYTON	I can take a lot, that's not one of 'em. I can take it. Real boy scout, is that it? You get lost in there and you're a footnote in the
F	BOWER	You can guide me... over two-way. PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	You know there's something wrong. How long can we wait in here before we have to try something?
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	How long did he wait? Silent stare as a SHUDDER passes, flickering the lights.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	What if no one else is awake and there's no one at the wheel?
M	PAYTON	Just in case... .there's mail you need to open quickly.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Wife...?
F	BOWER	Yeah... I think so.
M	PAYTON	Must be newlyweds. How can you forget something like that?
F	BOWER	What do-you remember? Anything yet?
M	PAYTON	Some pieces. Still a little fuzzy but you're the cocky little shit who wanted the window seat?
F	BOWER	And you're the cranky old bastard who made me take the aisle.
M	PAYTON	Give it some more time, pal. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, slide breath. Dammit. PAYTON'S voice crackles over the radio.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	How we doing?
F	BOWER	Nothing yet. Christ, not a single vent opening or- Nothing. How about on your end?
M	PAYTON	Power surges keep coming across in longer increments, just like you said. I'm gonna keep trying to get inside and run a dyno. Or at least try to get a pizza delivered.
F	BOWER	Hey? BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Got an intersection here. What are the choices? The light pans to endless shafts in each direction. He SNAPS
F	BOWER	A whole lot of the same... nothing.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	If you're gonna take a turn let's keep track. That way you can get back if there's no way out.
F	BOWER	Don't say that. BOWER lowers his head, breathing heavily.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	If you haven't seen anything yet... maybe you should head back now. BOWER sets his jaw and suddenly spots a SPIDER, gently
F	BOWER	I'll be damned. BOWER collects himself, a tightened jaw of determination.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	I'm taking a left. Make a note.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Left it is. BOWER turns the corner to follow the spider's path, the glow PAYTON looks to the name plate that reads Elysium and a small
M	PUSH IN	As he stares at the emblem, it seems memories are returning, Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his He nervously pans his light slowly up the wall and across the Payton? Nothing but STATIC. Payton!? Do you copy!? HEY!? Finally... I'm here. You alright? BOWER rubs the sweat from his eyes, anxiety increasing with
F	BOWER	I dunno. I dunno if I can- I can't tell if I'm going in circles or- There's nothing to- Can't breath-
M	PAYTON	Easy, pal. Breath easy. Listen to me- BOWER squirms, pushing outward against the walls of the shaft
F	BOWER	I just want... to stand up for God's sakes! Can't breath- Calm down. Listen, you gave it a shot. Let's get you back here.
F	BOWER	Back!? Are you kidding- I can't turn around! I can't even- Do you know how far I've gone!? Take it easy- BOWER bangs the wall of the shaft with desperation.
F	BOWER	I just want OUT of this FUCKING THING!
M	PAYTON	Bower? BOWER!? Stop it. Stop it! Just listen to me. Put it out of your head. Stop moving and breath. Listen to
M	BOWER (ON RADIO)	I can't... breath!
M	PAYTON	Put your mind somewhere else-
M	BOWER (ON RADIO)	Like WHERE!?
M	PAYTON	Well... this may not be the best time to tell you, but I got the door open.
F	BOWER	WHAT!? Are you fucking kidding me!?
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Yeah. I'm kidding you. BOWER lowers his head with exhaustion and a chuckle.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)	There ya go. Now just breath. Easy, pal. Easy. We'll get you through this. We'll figure this out together. Hear me? I do remember something.
F	BOWER	What's that?
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	My dream. On the way out. Real doozy. There I was at the Rose Bowl game. Naked and everyone was drunk but me. Spent two years looking for clothes. Long fucking Rose Bowl game. BOWER chuckles, his breathing growing more steady.
F	BOWER	Dream like that, sounds like you've got some... guilt issues.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Or just... clothing issues.
F	BOWER	Two years?
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Huh?
F	BOWER	You said two years. You think we've been asleep for two years?
M	I PAYTON (ON RADIO)	I do remember that being our duty rotation and... if we're team five that means we've been out for... .eight years. BOWER pulls the photo from his sleeve pocket, shining the
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	That can't be right. What can't be?
F	BOWER	Why would I-leave her? I can't even remember saying good-bye. Why would I?
M	PAYTON	Well, you aren't here on default. This was a select pick. This flight was... different. Different... how?
M	PAYTON	We're not just doing speed laps on the belt. This was something... special.
M	CLOSE UP	PAYTON gently rubs his hand across the emblem carved in the I remember... being interviewed. My mother seeing me on the news. This flight was... like no other. We weren't just pilots... BOWER looks up, shining the light down the shaft as the
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT-D)	We were... heroes. We were-
M	BOWER (INTO RADIO)	Someone's been through here.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	What? He pushes himself closer, squeezing between pipes for a
F	BOWER	Someone's been... BOWER notices the droplets of sweat dripping off his chin are
M	BOWER (CONT" D )	Wait a second-
M	PAYTON	What's wrong?
F	BOWER	I'm... I'm at an angle! Shit! BOWER panics as he begins to slide forward into a downward
M	BOWER (CONT`D)	No, no... N00000! He slides head first into a vertical drop, the shaft The flashlight falls through the grate and he watches in
F	BOWER	Aaaaeirrrgh!
M	PAYTON	Bower!? What happened? Bower!? All he can hear is the muffled, panicked struggle. The
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Bower!? Answer me! BANG, BANG... BASH! He breaks the vent and kicks until he's
M	PAYTON	Bower...!? Through the static comes a HOWL of victory.
F	BOWER	I'm... out! I'm- PAYTON breathes a heavy sigh of relief.
M	PAYTON	Jesus, don't scare me like that! Where are you?
F	BOWER	I'm- I'm inside a boot locker!
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	A what!?
F	BOWER	I'm inside a God damn- He shoves outward and the door SNAPS open. He falls out,
M	PAYTON	Bower...? You alright? BOWER!?
F	BOWER	Make that an overhead compartment. You with me, Payton? I got out. Hear me? He checks the transmitter, crackling with static.
M	PAYTON	Bower? Do you hear me? Bower...? Nothing but STATIC.
M	BOWER (INTO RADIO)	Payton? You there...? He cautiously ventures down the corridor as LIGHTS FLICKER
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Payton? Can you hear me!? Dead static. He sighs, looking down each of the corridors,
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Which way is which? I He examines the piping that runs along the ceiling, checking Hey...!? BOWER freezes, caught in a silent stand-off, the MAN'S
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Hello...? A low RUMBLE approaches as LIGHTS FLICKER past to reveal...
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Jesus... Christ. Jesus- BOWER back pedals with fear and confusion as distant THUMPS Payton...? Are you there? Answer me.
M	PAYTON	Bower? You there? Com'on, man. You there? Bower:? The familiar sound slowly returns overhead... The "sounds" are heard, muffled and now closer then before. Something is just beyond the wall, trying to get in. PAYTON
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Bower? Can you hear me? Bower? Answer me, God dammit. As he moves across the massive room, the neatly lined rows
M	I	A woman's voice growls into his ear, in German.
F	NADIA	Keine Bewegung!
F	BOWER	What-!? He tries to look up and... CRACK! Instant swelling over his Don't move! Wait a second-
F	NADIA	Don't you move MOTHER FUCKER! She quickly pats him down, stealing tools. All he can see is
F	BOWER	Wait- I'm part of the crew! I'm- CRACK! A hit silences him and the forceful frisk continues.
F	BOWER	I won't! Please! Just listen- I'm not-
F	NADIA	Take them off!
F	BOWER	What!?
F	NADIA	SHOES! I'll gut your ass-
F	BOWER	Alright, alright! Take it easy! He begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Bower? You there-? BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a
F	BOWER	Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it! she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to You crazy fucking bitch- He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room, His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,

F	BOWER	But, why would she try to kill me!? She was going to slit my throat! And why would they look like that? Look like what?
F	BOWER	You should have seen these guys. They were... a very fucked up looking gang. Why the hell would they be-- Payton, they were hunting. BOWER gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Hunting!?
F	BOWER	They sure-as-shit weren't a welcoming party from the Promenade deck! These guys were... looking to do some damage.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Take it easy-
F	BOWER	We've got to try to contact the bridge.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	You're assuming there is someone on the bridge.
F	BOWER	You're not!? We're not the only ones awake. Team Four wouldn't go back to sleep without waking us for rotation. Maybe they're on the main deck?
M	PAYTON	If they're in there... why haven't they thrown the security hammer into lock down? Seal and freeze it until the emergency units wake?
F	BOWER	Maybe they can't. With the systems kicking on and off- Maybe they're flying blind, with no control of the LFS? PAYTON eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the
M	PAYTON	Either way we can't assume help will be coming. On-board or off. Out here, there is no rescue. There is no turning around. This thing wasn't even built... .to return. He pauses off the involuntary memory relapse, looking to the
F	BOWER	What are you talking about? PAYTON glances across the control console, nodding with more
M	PAYTON	This is no regular transport. We're not out collecting data off the belt or hauling cargo... we are the cargo. It was a single launch trajectory for... That's as far as his memory allows, his words trailing off.
F	BOWER	.Tanis. Planetary processing and population. We're a settler's vessel. Elysium. This was a one-way ticket. BOWER'S gaze goes distant as...
M	FLASH IMAGE	Another place, another time, BOWER leans closer on a bed,
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	How could I have... left her? Why would I have done that? I loved her... BOWER snaps out of his trance. Payton!? Where is your wife?
M	PAYTON	What?
F	BOWER	We didn't leave them behind. No one did. They're on this flight! Remember the recruitment.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	The fucking breeding tests- The wives, the husbands- The- She's on this God damn flight!
M	BOWER (ON RADIO)	They're here. Somewhere on board.
M	I	officer's living quarters. The room is designed in a

M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Try to think of where they would be? A sleeping compartment for non-service
M	PAYTON	Hold it, hold it! Think about this for a What's there to think about!? I remember! There was thousands of passengers that weren't part of the development team. Families that-
M	PAYTON	No, listen to me! LISTEN! You know how big this ship is and there's no way of knowing exactly where- If you go on some wild goose chase to try to find her-
M	PAYTON	And then we would be no closer to getting out of this situation with even less time to regain control of the ship. BOWER stews, wanting to retort, his mind is racing.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	ship. Once we've taken control of the systems, finding them would be easy. Are you hearing me? We save the ship... we can save them all.
F	BOWER	But... how do we- I r PAYTON Where are you?
F	BOWER	I dunno. Officer's quarters, somewhere above D-level, I think- I don't-
M	PAYTON	I can guide you. Find out where you are. Hatch marker. Over the door. His flashlight finds one of the hatch doors and he climbs up
M	PAYTON	Take it. Climbing up the angled furnishings, he searches for any He climbs upward to an open hatch in the ceiling as we...
M	ANGLE ON	In the foreground, there is a small fish tank, completely dry
M	PAYTON (INTO RADIO)	Alright. I'll lay out a path for you and see if we can by-pass the main security doors.
M	BOWER (ON RADIO)	Guide me to where?
M	PAYTON	Back toward the flight decks. Back to me. I'm not coming back to you. What good would that do? I can't open that door from the other side--
M	PAYTON	What chance have you got out there on your own? We'll figure out a way to breach the command bridge- A power surge sends a SHUDDER and FLICKERING LIGHTS past...
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Bower...?
F	BOWER	Listen... if you can get me to the reactor bay. I can... reset the reactor's cycle.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	You know how to do that? Yes. If I can... we can take control of the ship. Open the doors, lights, get on the bridge. You got a better suggestion? Third crossing. Marker D-5381-X.
M	PAYTON	Okay. Hold up. I don't want you to go too far down that lane. Just catch your I don't need a rest. Which way?
M	PAYTON	I don't know vet. Hold on- BOWER backs to the wall, nervously scanning the corridor, In the background a SHADOW moves at the end of the corridor.
M	I	Feeling uneasy, BOWER slowly backs into a nearby compartment.
F	BOWER	Eden.
M	PAYTON	What did you say?
M	BOWER (ON RADIO)	The Eden. PAYTON nods, memories returning as he mumbles the name.
M	PAYTON	Of all things to remember, why would you pick that?
F	BOWER	I'm just thinking, maybe there's something we haven't considered. Eden failed... because of ODS syndrome. The one officer who was suffering from Pandorum. Cabin Fever. Maybe there was something similar with one of the earlier
M	PAYTON	No, no, no. You're talking about- Eden was lost because of a mechanical failure,
M	I	simple as that. A systems malfunction.
F	BOWER	That was the report... but don't you remember the story of the one flight officer... the real story? They say he went lunar, launched the entire ship, five thousand people killed with the flip of a switch. All from a bad case of cabin fever-?
M	PAYTON	spook story, along with a million others. Eden was mechanical failure, not human error. A. glitch... that was remedied way before we ever-
F	BOWER	And why did they switch the rotation shifts from three years to two? And they eliminated the manual over-ride-
M	PAYTON	They did that for obvious reasons, not because of Eden. BOWER pauses... within reach of the window only to realize it
F	BOWER	Well, at least we didn't wake up... floating away in a coffin.
M	PAYTON	Who says we didn't? BOWER climbs down, peering out into the corridor.
F	BOWER	Something happened to the other team? Maybe there was... Pandorum. BOWER looks to his own hand, cradling the weapon... his
M	I BOWER (CONT'D)	Which way?
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Left at the third marker. Two more levels down and we're there. BOWER heads down the corridor, making a turn as...
M	ANGLE ON	A shadowed FIGURE steps into view, slowly following his path He turns his light towards the ceiling and wall, which almost This can't be right-
M	PAYT ON	What's wrong?
F	BOWER	Have I done a circle or am I doubling back? Why do you say that?
F	BOWER	I've seen this before. This- We follow his flashlight to reveal... a BODY tangled in a It's... SHEPARD, a thin-framed man in a torn crew uniform,
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	a different one. There's booby-traps, rigged to the- SHEPARD'S eyes POP open wide with a terrified expression, His SCREAMS echo down the corridor, desperately fighting
F	BOWER	Stop it! Jesus, I'm not gonna- SHUT-UP! I'm not gonna hurt ya! Just shut the hell up! I'm gonna get you out of this thing. But, you have to be quiet, understand? SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized.
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Bower, you sure that's a good idea? He SNAP! The wire snare snaps free and SHEPARD goes to the
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)	Watch yourself! BOWER hesitates, the flashlight reveals SHEPARD'S
F	BOWER	He's... team six. The unit that's suppose to follow us. He's- As BOWER tries to wipe away blood, SHEPARD erupts again,
M	BOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)	Quiet! I'm not gonna hurt you! SHEPA.RD begins to moan, mumbling and weeping as he rubs
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Hey? You with me? You're gonna be alright. Hear me? Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices
M	SHEPARD	Shepard, Thomas L. Team Six. Sector Eight. I think I'm the only one, sir. I knew it. I knew you'd be coming.
F	BOWER	Huh?
M	SHEPARD	Where's the rest of your squad?

M	SHEPARD	Where's the shuttle?
F	BOWER	Shuttle? What are you talking about? SHEPARD'S expression drops.
M	SHEPARD	Aren't you the... retraction team? The
F	BOWER	No, no. Hold on. I'm from this crew. I'm from Team Five. SHEPARD'S face goes pale, eyes going hollow. His demeanor

F	BOWER	six... maybe eight hours ago. I had to crawl all the way from the upper deck
M	THROUGH THE-	SHEPARD seems bitterly impatient as he quickly begins
M	SHEPARD	So... you don't have a fucking clue to what's happened? Is that it?
F	BOWER	That's what we're trying to figure out! Tell me- what happened!?
M	I SHEPARD	You know as much as I do.
F	BOWER	I don't know anything.
M	SHEPARD	You'll fit right in. i SHEPARD feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil.
F	BOWER	What are you doing?
M	SHEPARD	Get the scent off.
F	BOWER	What ! ? SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the
M	SHEPARD	I can't help you. I'm sorry.
F	BOWER	Help.me? Wait a second-
M	SHEPARD	They go off scent and sound as far as I can tell and they're a lot fucking stronger and faster they you'd think.
M	SHEPARD (CONT'D)	When they come... run. Don't look back, no matter what.
F	BOWER	They- Who the hell are they!?
M	SHEPARD	I can't wait for you. BOWER is bewildered as SHEPARD poised like a sprinter,
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Bower, you tell this asshole the chain of command and a direct order to-
F	BOWER	God dammit, WAIT! You're still an officer of this ship and at present time, your CO is ordering you to- ordering? For your information, there's a new CO on board. So fuck you and your BOWER shoves him against the wall with force. Their struggle That's not going to help you. SHEPARD runs as BOWER hesitates, holding the gun towards the
M	PUSH IN	Fear over comes BOWER.
F	BOWER	Payton...?
M	PAYTON (ON RADIO)	Get the hell out of there. BOWER turns and runs, trying to follow SHEPARD as SHADOWED BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation Don't follow me! I can't help you- SHANK! A wire noose SNAPS tight around SHEPARD'S neck.

F	BOWER	They got him! They fucking ripped him apart! They're- Don't look back! Hear me? Just go! GO! They're everywhere! They're- I He runs through a doorway and a thin metal strip HITS him in BOWER tumbles as the wire loops around his leg and he FALLS The wire tightens and he's swung by the foot back into an

M	TANA..KA	Japanese- No Subtitles
F	BOWER	What...?
M	TANAKA	Japanese- No Subtitles
F	BOWER	I don't understand. I- I don't speak- TANAKA jabs a finger into the emblems on BOWER'S uniform.
M	TANAKA	Japanese - No Subtitles
F	BOWER	I'm sorry. I don't- Do you... speak English?
M	TANAKA	Japanese- No Subtitles They share a nod and an awkward silence, BOWER still eyeing
F	BOWER	Thanks. Thanks for... that. TANAKA is dead pan. BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the

F	BOWER	I'm sorry. I don't...

M	TANAKA	Japanese - No Subtitles.
F	BOWER	You're with... agriculture!? Jesus... Listen, I'm not- TANAKA jabs the emblem on BOWER'S chest, taps his tattoo. Japanese- No Subtitles
F	BOWER	Yes! I know! I'm with the flight crew! But, I don't know what's happened! I
M	CAN'T-	Another jab.
M	I	Realizing louder doesn't mean clearer, BOWER sighs at his own Listen, I'm going to find out what went wrong... with the ship.
M	TAANAKA	Shee-ip?
F	BOWER	Yes, I'm going to the reactor to try to-
M	TANAKA	Ree-actoh?
F	BOWER	Right. It doesn't really matter- You should stay put. Or go back to your compartment sector- Wait for the security systems to engage. Okay? We're gonna take care of this problem. Dead pan.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Okay? BOWER slowly backs away and TANAKA follows. BOWER stops,
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	No. Listen, you should stay. Wait here... for the systems to- Alright? Stay! TANAKA frowns as BOWER backs away, gesturing. BOWER reaches PAYTON is coated with sweat, viciously pounding on the locked He.lowers his head and slowly... the "SOUNDS" return. Like a dripping faucet of annoyance, PAYTON bitterly turns His flashlight pans up the wall to the ventilation shaft.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Dower...? That can't be... you- The SOUNDS remain muffled, deeper within the wall, possibly PAYTON contemplates, eyes panicked. He climbs up the wall A blood droplet hits the floor by his feet and PAYTON wipes A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and Open bar. Gotta be... E-deck?
M	I	He climbs over the bar, checks numerous cabinets only to find POW! A FIGURE lunges out, a direct HIT under his jaw sends A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be She rolls across the floor, grabbing her knife and... BOWER BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face,
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Knock it off! Both of ya! TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find Listen... nobody needs to get hurt here. Both of you just... cool out. And stop throwing that shit. Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Let's all just... go easy here. I understand it's been every man for himself around here lately, but if we're going to get out of this- A little God damn solidarity wouldn't hurt. We can work together here. We all want the same thing... right? NADIA remains poised, ready to fight, knife raised. Sighing
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Thanks... again. TANAKA motions toward the emblem on his uniform and gestures
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Yeah, yeah. I get it. We can work together on this, right? TANAKA grins.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	As long as we understand each other. They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the Japanese- No Subtitles
F	BOWER	Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left me with a few sore spots too, pal.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Listen, lady. We don't want any- Who the hell are you?
F	BOWER	Huh?
F	NADIA	You're... part of the flight crew?
F	BOWER	Yeah. I'm... a corporal, I'm-
F	NADIA	I didn't think there was any flight crew left. What's happened to us?
F	BOWER	That's what I'm trying to figure out. Malfunction of some sort-
F	NADIA	Gee, you think? Where are you going?
F	BOWER	I'm heading for the reactor bay.
F	NADIA	You just wake up?
F	BOWER	Just joining the program already in progress, yeah. She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised.
F	NADIA	You'll never make it.
F	BOWER	Oh yeah? And why is that?
F	NADIA	You're going the wrong direction. She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER
F	BOWER	Hey? Wait a second- HEY?
M	NADIR	SSSSH! Keep it down-
F	BOWER	Hold on. Who are you?
F	NADIA	Nobody.
F	BOWER	Wait- Can't join the team without a name.
F	NADIA	Team? Why would I want to join?
F	BOWER	Because I need you to show me the way.
F	NADIA	To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like going that fax down. No one ever comes back. She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She
F	BOWER	Hold on. Please- There's not much time left before we lose everything onboard. You understand what I'm trying to-
M	I NADIA	Do you know where this ship is headed?
F	BOWER	I'm working on it.
F	NADIA	Can you fly it?
F	BOWER	Huh?
F	NADIA	Can you fly it... if you have to? Sure. NADIA eyes him over, sizing him up.
M	NADIR	I'll get you as close to it as I can. But, I won't wait for you.
M	I	BOWER nods with a frown and she heads up the corridor. BOWER
M	TANAKA	Japanese- No Subtitles.
F	BOWER	My thoughts exactly. NADIA leads them down a long corridor that widens into an TANAKA keeps a watchful eye as BOWER frowns at the
M	BOLTER	You know where you're going? This doesn't... "feel" right. How long have you been awake?
F	NADIA	Don't know. There's no way to tell time in here. Two... maybe three months. His voice echoes across the cavernous atrium and she glares-
F	NADIA	Quiet! You wanna get us killed!? How could you have- You telling me people have been running around on board for several months!?
F	NADIA	Longer. I wasn't the first one up.
M	HIGH ANGLE	Their flashlight beams continue across the enormous room like
F	BOWER	Where are we going? What are we doing-
F	NADIA	i Shush! We're waiting.
F	BOWER	Waiting for what-?
F	NADIA	Quiet! At the far end of the corridor, a faint BLUISH GLOW grows NADIA gestures for them to stay put. TANAKA wants to leave,
F	NADIA	Ssssht! The HISS and CACKLES of the HUNTERS grow closer and it seems As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates, The SHUDDER passes, killing the power and the door stops...
F	BOWER	Who are they? What the hell are those things?
F	NADIA	Never quite felt like sticking around to find out. Running... is always the best option. Believe me.
F	BOWER	They're not- They can't be from this ship. They don't seem... human. Do you think something got on board or maybe I something... He turns to follow her and pauses to see... What is... all this?
F	NADIA	Ecological Development, Embryonic Charter. Livestock and wildlife re- population. The rows of glass tubes are labelled, ranging from mountain NADIA checks a few gauges on the wall of tubes and makes
F	BOWER	You've been living in here? You're... protecting it?
M	NADIR	It' seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting. Regardless of the situation, we still have a mission. We've only lost about thirty percent of the specimens, mostly reptilian class. Never was big into snakes anyway. BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a
F	BOWER	Tanis.
F	NADIA	You couldn't remember?
F	BOWER	No, I- I didn't remember just how far away it is... until now. This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	How could I have forgotten that?
F	NADIA	It comes only in pieces. Even after a few months. I know everything about this vault and its systems... but I still can't remember where I grew up. Or my brother's name. Only pieces... And the training comes back first. For good reason, I guess. BOWER eyes the darkened computer terminals, portions of the
F	BOWER	How could we have become like this... in only eight years? NADIA ponders the thought, rotating her jaw. She digs into
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	What is this?
F	NADIA	Dehydrated meatloaf. House special. I save 'em for the weekends. BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a Do you know how long it would take to turn dehydrated meatloaf into that?
F	BOWER	How long?
F	NADIA	I don't know, but it takes more then a couple years to turn coal into fucking diamonds.
F	BOWER	You think we've over slept?
F	NADIA	This ship was built to outlast our children's children... and any engineer could tell ya the warranty is running out. I think we've been asleep longer then you may think. BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with
F	BOWER	Do you have a radio?
F	NADIA	Who the hell is there to call?
F	BOWER	I'm not the only flight crew officer awake. We're not in this alone. He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight. The
M	ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP	A vent panel lightly RATTLES, the metal begins to bend.
M	PAYTON	You want in? Come and get it you fu- The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON
M	GALLO (O.S.)	Help... me! PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a
M	PAYTON	Who the hell... are you!? GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl
M	GALLO	Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew! I'm- Please- HELP ME! PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He
M	PAYTON	Easy... Easy. You're all right. PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he
M	PAYTON	EASY! I'm here to help you! PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips, but the water runs down
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Com'on. Try to drink a little. Here.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	What's your name? Huh? Can you hear me? Gallo.
M	PAYTON	What's that? Gallo...? PAYTON frowns, mumbling the name with a hint of recognition.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Corporal... Gallo? Yes, sir.
M	PAYTON	Where did you come from, Gallo?
M	GALLO	The... bridge. Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance.
M	PAYTON	The bridge!? Where are we? What's happened? Can you tell me- The more PAYTON inquires, the more GALLO begins to unravel,
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Corporal?
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Tell me... what happened? GALLO is hyper-ventilating, eyes wide with terror. A droplet
F	NADIA	We can't get through this way.
F	BOWER	I'd prefer to stay on foot.
F	NADIA	It's the safest way to travel. And there's only one other way to get through that I know of.
F	BOWER	And what is that?
F	BOWER	Where are we?
F	NADIA	Main corridor. Hyper-sleep chamber, Personnel. Keep your light down. She leads the way along the wall and into a compartment of
F	BOWER	Jesus... As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep-
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	My God. They're... empty. They're all- Where the hell is everyone?
F	NADIA	Keep quiet.
M	I	As the dozens and dozens of nameplates move past his
F	BOWER	Wait a second. My wife-
F	NADIA	Keep moving.
F	BOWER	No, wait. My wife could be in here. BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods,
F	NADIA	What does she do? What's her specialty?
F	BOWER	She's not part of the crew, but spouses were brought with. I remember there were-
F	NADIA	Then she's not in here. This is development settlers. Engineers. NADIA quickly continues as BOWER tries to keep up.
F	BOWER	Do you know where the family members are- Quiet! They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind, crouched and
F	BOWER	I don't see what he's looking at, do you?
F	NADIA	We have to keep moving. We don't want to stay out in the open for too long. Especially in here. Hey...? Let's go! Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they
F	NADIA	We can't stay herel NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him
F	BOWER	Let's get out of here! Com'on- The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows.
F	BOWER	We can't just leave him. We have to wait-
F	NADIA	Then you wait... and find your own way.
F	BOWER	We can't split up the team, it's all
F	NADIA	I told you I'm not going to wait. I'm not gonna get myself killed for-
F	BOWER	The guy saved my life twice already. I'm not gonna leave him-
F	NADIA	What do you think he's doing in there!?
F	BOWER	How the hell should I know-
F	NADIA	He's hunting! Bagging the next notch on his belt. You wait for him! Good luck. I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened
F	BOWER	Wait! I'm coming- There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light,
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	Jesus! NADIA turns toward him to see...
M	REVERSE ANGLE	Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and My God! Wait- Where are we going!? NADIA suddenly grabs him, a quick jerk to silence him. A Don't move. They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly Where... did it go-? He pans the light and... ROAR! The HUNTER lunges at them THWACK! TANAKA lunges out of the shadows, delivering a blow Jesus... Christ- Jesus- Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial What the... what the hell is it!? The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright. BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN slowly
F	BOWER	What is he... doing? BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows
F	NADIA	Run.
F	BOWER	They're... everywhere-
F	NADIA	Run! A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLIN'S throat. Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA,
F	BOWER	What the hell happened to them!? What the hell are those things!?
F	NADIA	Shut-up! They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER
M	TANAKA	Japanese - No subtitles.
F	BOWER	I second that. Let's get the fuck out of here. Which way did we come from?
F	NADIA	You want to go back?
F	BOWER	No, I mean... let's just go!
F	NADIA	We should go back. Find a different path. I don't think we can get through to the reactor bay from-
F	BOWER	You said there was no other path.
F	NADIA	I'm ready to explore other options-
F	BOWER	Which way did they go-?
F	NADIA	You really want to discuss it here!? A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison. The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and
F	NADIA	What are you doing-!?
F	BOWER	They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA
M	PAYTON (INTO RADIO)	Bower? Do you copy? You out there? Dead static. He sighs and glances toward GALLO, passed out He feels his neck for a pulse. He notices the dried blood
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	Team Four. Flight Team... Four? He glances up to see GALLO is now awake, staring at him.
M	GALLO	What are you doing?
M	PAYTON	Just... checking you. GALLO narrows his eyes, pulling the blanket tighter.
M	GALLO	For what?
M	PAYTON	To make sure you're... alright. You... passed out. You-
M	GALLO	Who the hell are you?
M	PAYTON	Payton... Lieutenant Payton.
M	GALLO	Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant?
M	PAYTON	That's right. You're Team Four? You're suppose to be... my predecessor. GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	You said... you came from the bridge? GALLO shifts his eyes back on him, a bad topic. Yeah. So...?
M	PAYTON	Where are we? I can't get guidance off this system and I have no idea where-
M	GALLO	I don't know.
M	PAYTON	Well, what did you see? How did--
M	GALLO	Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all look alike. I don't know! How the hell would I know!? Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a
M	PAYTON	Easy. I just want to make sure... GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably.
M	PAYTON (CONT'D)	.you're okay- GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively.
M	GALLO	I'm fine. PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the
M	PAYTON	Is this your blood... Corporal?
M	GALLO	Some of it is... sir.
M	PAYTON	Whose blood is it? GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening.
M	GALLO	They didn't give me any choice.
M	PAYTON	Who didn't?
M	GALLO	There was something wrong with them.
M	PAYTON	i Something was wrong with who? Off his stare, he understands the implication.
M	PAYTON (CONT' D )	Your crew?
M	GALLO	It was... Pandorum. Of the worst sort. They were- I couldn't even- I had to defend myself.
M	PAYTON	Pandorum. Both of them-?
M	GALLO	You don't believe me? I believe you. PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid
M	GALLO	What are you doing? What is that?
M	PAYTON	It's just a sedative. Help you relax- GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.
M	GALLO	Then you take it... and relax. PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside.
M	PAYTON	Take it easy. We're on the same team here. Alright? Sure, Lieutenant. PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his GALLO holds a hollow stare on the back of his head. If you would have seen them... you would have done the same thing... sir. LIGHTS FLICKER past... TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing
F	BOWER	Didn't we come through here already?
F	NADIA	We gotta find a way out.
F	BOWER	Out? Why did we come iii-?
F	NADIA	I was trying to get us out of there alive-
F	BOWER	I thought you knew where you were going.
F	NADIA	I was trying to save our asses-
F	BOWER	Could've mentioned that after the first mile. If I would have known we'd be doing laps down here- She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand.
F	NADIA	I didn't need to help you at all! You and the Hong-Kong Express would still be playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if it weren't for me! Their heightening confrontation is halted by...
M	TANAKA	HIIISSST! ( .and whispered Japanese) They pause to hear... CLASSICAL MUSIC echoing from below.
F	BOWER	What the hell is that? They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	What is this!? BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates
M	LELAND	No, no, no. Back in der' big boy! LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKA'S hand. He loses his grip
F	BOWER	Get back! BACK! BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises
M	LELAND	Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!?
M	LELAND (CONT'D)	What did you do!? BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him.
F	BOWER	Shut off the gas!
M	LELAND	Where did you get that? BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers
M	LELAND	Fancy looking piece. Looking to trade?
M	LELAND	Com'in, com'in! Make yerselves at home. Just throw the coats on the bed and don't pet the rat, it's not mine. Just watching it for a friend. LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the
F	BOWER	You... live here?
M	LELAND	Sublet. Got a roomier flat in the bow for the off season, but from here, ya just can't beat the commute. He grins, expecting a laugh, but doesn't get one. LELAND
M	LELAND (CONT'D)	You really a flyer, or did ya grab that off the rack? i didn't think there was any crew left.
F	BOWER	Left? Have you seen any?
M	LELAND	Well, only the captain. informally, mind you.
F	BOWER	Captain? Where!?
M	LELAND	Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few pieces on the promenade and I think his nuts are in the foose-ball game in the rec room. He smiles, revealing several missing teeth. No one laughs.
M	LELAND (CONT'D)	Tough crowd. Com'in, com'in. Grab a bunk. Three singles or will a queen do? LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER
F	BOWER	Why don't you come on down so we can meet properly?
M	LELAND	Oh, no-no. No-can-do. I'm real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been. No offense. There's something funky going around. But don't let that spoil the party. Here... LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items,
M	I LELAND (CONT'D)	It's Kosher. BOWER peeks through one of the valves, turning to NADIA.
F	BOWER	Where do you think we are?
F	NADIA	I don't know. Gotta be somewhere below B- deck.
M	LELAND	Why, where you gotta be?
F	BOWER	The reactor bay. Know where it is?
M	LELAND	Reactor? Now why would you want to go down there? You just woke up, didn't cha?
M	LELAND	It's tough to properly season with a motor oil base. But if you use your imagination, kinda tastes like... Herb and garlic dog shit. Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is
F	BOWER	How long have you been awake?
M	LELAND	Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today, Tuesday? That would be about, mmm... He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully No idea. He turns back to his make-shift stove, chuckling to himself.
M	LELAND (CONT-D)	I quit counting after the band broke up, ooooh twenty... thirty years ago. BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The
M	LELAND (CONT-D)	Then again, an hour in this place feels more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty. Know whatta I mean? HA-HP_W! Not naming names but I'm writing a very strongly worded letter to the airline. But I just treat each day like it's Christmas. Festive and violent. Let's eat; Shall we? Who needs a bib? LELAND sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it
F	BOWER	Those things out there. Could it have been something... that crawled out of your lab? Something that-
F	NADIA	No. That's... not possible.
F	BOWER	Then something got on board. Some kind of life form. Something that-
F	NADIA	Or something that was already on board, with us in the hyper-bunks.
F	BOWER	What does that mean?
M	NADIR	it could have been the accelerator.
F	BOWER	What?
F	NADIA	It's the only theory I can come up with. The synthetic enzyme in our feeding tubes. The accelerator that would help our bodies adjust and adapt to the environmental conditions on Tanis. From what I've seen... these things have adapted... to the ship instead.
F	BOWER	But, why would- You're saying we'll become like them? Why would they be affected like that and we're not-
F	NADIA	I don't know. Like I said, it's the only theory I can think of- Unless...
M	ANGLE ON	GALLO is looking at the empty sleep chambers while PAYTON
M	GALLO	Do you know the symptoms of Pandorum?
M	PAYTON	What?
M	GALLO	Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome. Pandorum. Ever witnessed the symptoms of first-hand?
M	PAYTON	I've seen it before. But nothing that-
M	GALLO	It's not something you can easily detect. Starts with a shiver. An itch. A slow boil... and without being able to get off the ship... there's no shutting off the heat. It'll boil over, no matter what you do. GALLO is slowly pacing the room and PAYTON watches him with You don't believe me.
M	PAYTON	I didn't say that-
M	GALLO	How could they both have had it? The odds are insurmountable.
M	PAYTON	I wasn't about to question any of your
M	GALLO	But, we all know Pandorum is greatly affected by any substantial psychological It has an emotional trigger effect.
M	PAYTON	That's what they say. GALLO slowly rubs his temples, with hesitation.
M	GALLO	How do you think you would react... if you knew the truth?
M	PAYTON	The truth... about what?
M	LELAND	B0000OM! Oh, how the world cheered to the thunder of it's mightiest creation. Eylisium! The heaven for heroes, to venture further and farther then any of man's machine dared before it. BOWER and NADIA watch intently as TANAKA lazily sips the Three of our bravest... atop the watch tower as we slept. A slumber deeper then any have dared... with only three little Indians left to mind the store...
M	GALLO	we were only into our second term. All flight systems nominal. I'd picked up on symptoms with my CO and 2nd Lieutenant. Mild symptoms. Nothing I thought would... become a problem. Until we got the transmission.
M	PAYTON	What transmission? GALLO'S eyes are welling up, his lip begins to shiver.
M	GALLO	The final transmission. The last message... from home.
M	I LELAND	.until the last cry from home. All of God's creation... ending with mere words of encouragement. Mother Earth's last call. Boop! Leave a message, momma. LELAND presses a switch on a Jerry-rigged piece of equipment,
M	RECORDER VOICE	Hoove arr awl dadz efft ah uz. Bood uck, boogz guezz... ab hoobz deeb. BOWER and NADIA are now completely engrossed in the story,
M	RECORDER VOICE (CONT'D)	Hoove err all wadz efft ah uz. Good wuck, boogz guezz... abb hoobz deeb...
F	BOWER	What is that... saying? LELAND cranks a power lever, speeding up the play back with
M	RECORDER VOICE	Yoove are all watt efft of uz. Good uck, gog besh... ab Gogz deez. You are all whadz left of uz. Gog besh... and Gogs sbeeb... God blezz... and Gogz speeb...
M	LELAND & RECORDER	You are all that's left of us. Good luck, God bless... and God's speed.
M	GALLO	You are that's left of us. Good luck, God bless... and God's speed.
M	PAYTON	Earth... is gone? GALLO puffs across his hand with twisted amusement.
M	GALLO	Wiped away. We ran a full sweep off the grid and they were... gone. One day there, the next... nothing.
M	PAYTON	In one day... it had to be nuclear or-?
M	GALLO	Whatever it was, they knew it was coming. Wished us well. We're all that's left.
M	PAYTON	Oh my God...
M	GALLO	You can see why I was hesitant... to tell even you. My fellow crew members didn't take the news too well. I wanted to wake the primary crew... but my 2nd Lt was already over the edge.
M	GALLO (CONT'D)	ODS came through with flying colors. No logic, no reasoning left. No future, no past, no hope. A dangerous mix when you're stuck inside a tin can like this. The blow was more then he could handle. My lieutenant wasn't far behind. Pandorum.
M	LELAND	Three little Indians, with the burden to bare... no more law and nothing left to care. Three poor souls, destiny undone. Chop, chop, chop... now there's only one.
M	GALLO	They were my commanding officers. Men who had guided me through FT. I looked up to these men. But... it wasn't them anymore. They... were gone. They... tried to... I had no choice. I- With his body beginning to tremble, PAYTON tries to console
M	PAYTON	Easy...
M	LELAND	One little Indian left... all alone with his doom.
M	LELAND (CONT`D)	Refused to go to bed, stayed up to play in his room. Oh, and what naughty little games he would play with the slumbering prey. Slayer, master, both God and the Devil, some would say. The boy would grow to manhood, a self-proclaimed King, ruler of his vessel, home to his own sin. The sketches show the lone pilot torturing and devouring
M	LELAND (CONT-D)	And then one day the king cast out all those who had behaved, exiled into the barren cargo holds to fend for themselves... scavenging against the others within their own domain. The sketches show tortured victims forced out into the
M	LELAND (CONT`D)	King Lonely no longer wanted to play... he yearned to see the morning Sun on a Tanis day. He returned to his bed of
M	I	slumber, waiting for the day. But the survivors lived on, as the King slept, a whole new world of evil grew as we wept. The seed driven beyond- you want me to back up?
F	BOWER	Play that transmission again. I want-
M	LELAND	Save yer questions til the end please. We'll have a review. LELAND continues his performance as NADIA leans toward BOWER
F	NADIA	Could that be real? You think that could-
F	BOWER	I dunno. It can't be- It just- BOWER is quickly growing drowsy, slurring his words as he
M	LELAND	And now the newest chapter comes to us... three weary travelers, guided by the light. The new brave flyer, woken by the dying machine. He sketches Bower and his journey towards the reactor.
M	LELAND (CONT'D)	A gallant knight who will wake the fiery beast, light the rockets torch that will sail our mighty ship to port! A new king to deliver us to paradise! Hail to the new King... Hail! LELAND looks to see... everyone is asleep. He adjusts a PAYTON is silently in shock as... GALLO watches him closely
M	PAYTON	How could they... how could they have let this happen? PAYTON slides his hands off the keyboard, his finger tips A low SHUDDER approaches, more powerful then felt before, EVALON is smiling towards BOWER as he kneels in front of her, NADIA jumps to her feet, choking and gasping, jabbing her
F	BOWER	What are you doing!? What the-
F	NADIA	He was- He was gonna fucking eat me!
M	LELAND	Whaw!? I waddn't-
F	NADIA	He gassed us! He was gonna- All of us! LELAND is appalled, spitting out the breathing tube.
M	LELAND	Gas! What gas!? They see he's holding a fork and knife that he quickly tucks THE SHUDDER shakes the tank with more force then ever before
F	NADIA	What is that?
F	BOWER	It's gone... into the final cycle.
F	NADIA	What does that mean?
F	BOWER	it means we have less time then I thought. The last phase... before shutdown. It means we're... done. BOWER is oddly defeated, taking a seat, hanging his head.
F	NADIA	Done!? What do you mean done? What do we do? Hey!?
F	BOWER	What difference does it make?
F	NADIA	What are you talking about? You said you could reset the reactor- That we could- That there's a chance to-
F	BOWER	For what? They're gone. Everything is gone. There's no Earth to go back to,
F	NADIA	We weren't meant to go back! We were meant to go on. And now it's more important then ever! We're the last of-
F	BOWER	And what is left of us? What's left, worth saving? This flight's over. NADIA is angered by his defeat, shoving LELAND aside and
F	NADIA	What about your duty? What about... your wife!? There's still a chance she's-
F	BOWER	She's dead.
F	NADIA	You don't know that for sure!
F	BOWER	I know... NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye. BOWER snaps out of his daze, turning to LELAND.
F	BOWER	You got a radio?
M	LELAND	Who the hell are you gonna call-? You promise to bring it back?
M	BOWER (ON RADIO)	Payton? Do you copy? Can you hear me!? He grabs the receiver.
M	PAYTON	BOWER! I'm here! Where are you?
F	BOWER	Storage Tanks, just below B-level. Mid- ship Sector twelve... we think.
M	I PAYTON	How the hell did you get all the way to Y the other side of-
M	I BOWER (ON RADIO)	Payton, listen to me. Listen. The I reactor is in its final stage. Its last rotation. It's worse then we thought. PAYTON looks to GALLO, who is silently watching with a hollow
M	BOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT`D)	The ship is dying and I think that's why it finally woke us up. The entire system is heading into permanent shutdown and there will be no return. This entire ship will float off into eternity with no way of stopping it. We need to reset it. Are you hearing me? PAYTON and GALLO share a silent stare.
M	PAYTON	I hear you. How do we get you in there?
M	I BOWER	I need you to give me a path. PAYTON and GALLO'S silent stare hangs in the air for a
F	BOWER	What? TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He
M	TANAKA	
M	LELAND	What did he say?
F	BOWER	I dunno. But do what he says. They follow TANAKA, crawling through the hole and into... They exchange silent gestures and TANAKA heads one direction BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of Oh... my... God... The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a
M	NADIA (CONT-D)	stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It's just a child!
F	BOWER	Child! ? That's no child! What the hell is it!? TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER
M	LELAND	Not as cute when they're little, are they? TANAKA runs after it. It takes a moment for the rest to The CHILD runs up a wall of tubing and ducks through a small
F	NADIA	My God. They're... breeding.
F	BOWER	What!? What do you mean they? How could they- That's impossible. It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW
M	LELAND	Little bastard rang the bell. They all quickly turn back, running down a side corridor and They silently share the horror of the possible numbers
M	LELAND	This isn't going to work. Too many of them. Have to turn back.
F	NADIA	There's no where to turn back to. We can't give up-
M	LELAND	Told you this wouldn't fly.
F	NADIA	You didn't tell us anything. You never said that. You said you'd love to come- Oh... then I forgot. This won't work.
F	BOWER	Why not?
M	LELAND	This is where they live. Reactor is the Keeper's temple. They watch and wait as the shadows move past the doorway with GALLO watches him while slowly pacing the room.
M	GALLO	What are you doing?
M	PAYTON	I think the direct channels are fried. I'm gonna run a patch so we can get this door open as soon as we're back on-line.
M	GALLO	What's so important on the other side of the door?
M	PAYTON	The bridge. As soon as we're up we'll be able to take control of guidance. But only from on the bridge. GALLO continues pacing, throwing glances toward the empty
M	GALLO	This ship is not dying. PAYTON refuses to look to GALLO, continuing his work.
M	GALLO (CONT'D)	It's already dead. You really believe that kid will be able to save this ship?
M	PAYTON	He can do it.
M	GALLO	Twelve hours ago, he didn't know his own name. Now, you think he's ready to re- configure a nuclear reactor? PAYTON refuses to give him eye contact, continuing to work on
M	PAYTON	He's the only shot we have. Gotta have a little faith.
M	GALLO	Faith? After what you know now, you can actually say that with a straight face? A little faith? THAP. A droplet of blood hits the floor at GALLO'S feet. The GLOW of the HUNTERS slowly begins to fade from sight as NADIA follows him with a frown as LELAND and TANAKA remain
F	NADIA	What are you doing? What is it? These were... family members of flight personnel. She notices BOWER is holding EVALON'S photo and glances to You think she's... here?
F	BOWER	She's not here. She's dead.
F	NADIA	How do you know for sure? She could be-
F	BOWER	She's not on this flight. She wouldn't come with me. She wouldn't marry me. That's why I came. There was nothing left for me there. She stayed on Earth. Gone... with everyone else. And I left because of her. His gaze begins to gloss over, taking it all in.
F	NADIA	Well, then... she saved your life. BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement.
F	BOWER	Marianne.
F	NADIA	you... knew her?
F	BOWER	I remember her. Payton's wife.
F	NADIA	Who's... Payton?
F	BOWER	I remember her. I remember- His eyes pull focus, coming out of his daze, memories
M	NADIR	Are you alright?
F	BOWER	Com'on. BOWER grips his weapon with a flexing jaw of determination,
M	ANGLE ON	M. PP_YTON'S name plate and the dried remains of her apparent Droplets of blood hit the floor at GALLO'S feet as he paces
M	GALLO	He's right about one thing. Once that thing shuts down, we're as good as dead. Nothing on this ship will ever turn on again. Ever. Not the air, not the lights, the heat... not even the pod's escape launch systems. PAYTON refuses to look up from the computer.
M	3 PAYTON	What are you saying?
M	GALLO	I'mï¿½saying... once it's done. We're done. But, we still have a way out of this... before it's too late.
M	PAYTON	What are you suggesting, Corporal?
M	GALLO	We can still launch ourselves in the pods. Before the ignition systems are completely dead, sir.
M	PAYTON	Launching ourselves... into deep space when we don't even know where we are? We wouldn't last more then a few days inside those things. That's suicide-
M	GALLO	A few days is better then what we have left here. I'll take my chances. How long do you think that reactor has been sitting? That thing could melt-down when he tries to fire the core. This ship could be ripped in half-
M	PAYTON	Stand down, Corporal. We're not going to abandon anything and we're not going to leave them behind-
M	GALLO	We can't stay on this ship. You know that as well as I do-
M	PAYTON	I said stand down, Corporal! That's an order! GALLO steps up behind PAYTON, his face revealed with a thin
F	BOWER	This is our chance. BOWER leads the way out of the hiding place, heading quickly
F	BOWER	This is it. We've got to get down there before they come back. BOWER looks for a path downward along the tangled metal of I House of the Keepers. A descent to Hell itself. We can't... go in here. I BOWER ignores his pleas, heading down a ladder into the
M	LELAND (CONT'D)	You're crazy... You can't-
M	NADLA	Shut-up! Move! LELAND stays behind, watching as they begin a perilous With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what LELAND is nervously watching from above, leaning further over The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs Upon seeing the sleeping HUNTERS, LELAND fearfully backs BOWER grabs a vine, but it breaks away and he dangles over His eyes widen with horror, quickly searching for a solution.
M	PAYTON	He's in! That's the reactor's activator panel. We're going to make it out of
M	I	this. Trust me. No response. GALLO'S shadow moves behind him, his voice
M	GALLO	Trust you? How can I trust someone who isn't even honest with himself. Tell me?
M	PAYTON	Gallo... you have to listen to me... Carefully. You don't haveâ¢to- GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing
M	GALLO	Don't do that. TRAP... TRAP... THAP. Blood drops hit the floor heavily.
M	PAYTON	Don't... do what? PAYTON slides his hand further across the console, reaching I
M	GALLO	Don't talk to me like some child that needs reassurance. Think I don't know the risks? Think I don't know this ship?
M	PAYTON	Take it easy- GALLO'S presence is felt behind him, his voice seeming to
M	GALLO	I know this ship and what she's capable of better then anyone. I know her... and I know what she can and can't do.
M	PAYTON	Easy...
M	GALLO	And this... she can't do! Why are we even arguing. You know it-
M	PAYTON	I'm giving you an order...
M	GALLO	You wanna stay here to die, that's your choice, not mine!
M	PAYTON	.to stand-down... Corporal. PAYTON shoves himself out of his chair, reaching for the pipe
M	GALLO (CONT`D)	Who's being irrational here, Lieutenant? Tell me? Who's being delusional!? Hmm? PAYTON raises his hands, calmly submitting.
M	PAYTON	Think about what you're doing...
M	GALLO	I'm getting off this ship. My flight's over. OVER! Another panel on the console begins to gently blink as... BOWER unfolds the auxiliary power lever, each movement
M	PAYTON	This won't work...
M	GALLO	Shut-up. GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head
M	PAYTON	just think about what you're doing- PAYTON continues entering the launch code as GALLO steps
M	PAYTON	It wasn't the crew that was sick, was it?
M	GALLO	Finish the code...
M	PAYTON	What did you really do to them...? GALLO slides into the pod and... PAYTON hits a key and LIGHTS BLINK. GALLO looks away for a PAYTON wedges a pipe through the handle as GALLO violently
M	PAYTON	For your own good-
M	PAYTON	You're not well, Corporal. You just need the proper treatment-
M	PAYTON	This isn't your fault-
M	PAYTON	Your mind... has turned against itself.
F	NADIA	Hurry! Go! BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and A booby-trap is sprung, hydraulic pistons SNAP a razor-wire
F	BOWER	Com'on... NADIA looks back to see there are still HUNTERS in the
F	NADIA	Bower...?
F	BOWER	I'm going as fast as I can- He hits the final key as NADIA grabs his shoulder. He turns
M	PAYTON	I My God... he did it! He did it.
M	CONTINUED:	The SCREENS FLICKER BRIGHTLY, all of the systems engaging.
M	GALLO	Let me out. I can... help. PAYTON ignores him, typing rapidly into the keyboard.
M	GALLO (CONT'D)	I'll help you! Please- I can help! PAYTON runs over to the security door and hits a switch on What are you doing? You can't- You're trying to get on the bridge? PAYTON runs back to the console, typing into the terminal.
M	GALLO (CONT'D)	You don't want to go in there, Corporal. PAYTON throws him a glare, continuing to type in commands as
M	GALLO (CONTT' D )	What are you going to tell them? Huh? How are you going to explain that?
M	PAYTON	shut-up. They'll know what you did. Other HUNTERS have retreated away from the reactor, cowering WEASEL has incredibly quick reflexes as he springs back to HEFLIN waiting for him. They stare one another down, both raising their bladed HEFLIN lunges with a HISS and blades CLASH!
M	GALLO	Where do you think you're going? PAYTON continues to work the control panels, looking to the
M	GALLO	Think about what you're doing, sir- GALLO pushes his knees against the hatch, the pipe beginning You don't want to see what's in there-
M	HUNTERS.	What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a
M	ANGLE ON/CRANE UP	BOWER and NADIA run across the top of the sleep chamber wall, Metal blades SPARK as they connect between HEFLIN and TANAKA. TANAKA tries to grab a hold of him, but HEFLIN digs in with TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide
F	BOWER	Go... GO! GO! Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with
F	NADIA	You snake bastard- OPEN IT! Inside the door at the far end... PAYTON is at the control
M	GALLO	We both know who needs this shot... PAYTON counters with the bladed weapon.
M	GALLO	Who's the one suffering... sir- PAYTON lunges with the weapon, RAGE in his EYES as... GALLO
M	GALLO	Corporal... PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older. PAYTON slams him again, a FLASH that reveals GALLO has aged
M	GALLO	Your mind... has turned against itself,
M	PAYTON	I'll FUCKING CARVE YOU UP! Within the struggle, hands grab at weapons, a wrist is The syringe is stabbed into skin. The trigger fires liquid,
M	GALLO & PAYTON	It's for the best... Corporal. LELAND runs up the corridor, through the doors and into the PAYTON is ALONE. He's just injected the syringe into his own
M	LELAND	We made it! We- I'm with your boy. I was the one helping with- GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat! LELAND reels back in
M	I PAYTON	Captain on the bridge. He heads toward the bridge, while flipping another switch
M	ANGLE ON	BOWER and NADIA angrily burst through the hatch in the floor,
F	BOWER	That's it! GO! Go for it! With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with BOWER and NADIA back further away, turning to see the room.
F	NADIA	Where's... your lieutenant?
F	BOWER	He's not my lieutenant. She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room What's happened... to us? Where are we?
F	BOWER	Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've I been out... and how far we've gone. BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll NADIA walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the Seems my little memory lapse has finally worn off... "Lieutenant". BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the Mine too.
F	BOWER	Who the hell are you? GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	You're team four. Why would you... switch bunks? Pretend to be someone else? What would you be wanting to hide? Who the hell are you?
M	GALLO	I was younger then you when I first came on board. Funny, I can't even remember what it was like... before this flight began. It's all I know.
F	BOWER	You were the one... who first received the final transmission. Who refused to go back to sleep. You stayed awake... for all those years. What were you doing... what crimes were you hiding from when you took Payton's bunk? The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into How the hell would you know all that?
F	BOWER	Is it true? What have you done to us? Where are we now? GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.
M	GALLO	Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me. BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He What are. you gonna do, Bower? There's no one left to hand out merit badges. No one left at all.
F	BOWER	And that makes it okay? To play God?
M	GALLO	You think God survived? He's gone... with the rest. There's no one left to judge you, Bower. NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily
F	BOWER	Judgement will come for you. You think you could cover it? Your victims survived. Evolved. That's your creation out there. Your crime. BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	And you thought you'd be able to hide it? Who would ever suspect that? Who would ever remember? I remember. NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the
M	GALLO	No world left. No law. No order. Only us. You the law now? You gonna be the one that brings order to what's left? Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best with what I was given. Wanna be King for a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd like to see how you fare. With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly
M	GALLO (CONT`D)	Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself for five minutes without morality. I'll bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid-
F	BOWER	Shut-up. What's out there? NADIA shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the
M	GALLO	Imagine... us both. What's left to stop you? I offer you the kingdom and you-
M	GALLO	There's still quite a few sleeping beauties down there... a thousand flavors. You up for a little window shopping?
F	BOWER	Shut-up!
M	GALLO	I wanna see it. I'll bet you'd be a
M	REEEEAL TIGER-	BOWER suddenly shoves him out of the chair, slamming him to
F	BOWER	There will be law... in whatever world we create. And you'll pay for what you've done. Believe me. GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor.
M	GALLO	A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo? NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit What is it? GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin.
M	BOWER (CONT'D)	What do you see!?
M	GALLO	You ready for the new world, corporal? BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to We've... we've already crashed. We've already... we're... The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a

M	GALLO	I guess this thing does land itself. Just doesn't float too well. BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one,
M	G_ALLO (CONT'D)	And you thought you could be King!? He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy
M	I	GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The

M	GALLO (CONT'D)	My apologies. Ladies first... of course. The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across... GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade
F	NADIA	NO!? Are you crazy- He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits Not like this! I can't- like this!
F	BOWER	Hold on! Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite.
M	POV	They are pulling away from the side of the ship. The Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
F	NADIA	I What are you doing!?
F	BOWER	1 Put it on!
F	NADIA	No! I can't- Not like this! I'm not going to wake up and drowned- He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her
F	BOWER	Hey...? Hey? She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself, Where are we? What happened? It's all right. It's safe to wake up this time.
M	I	With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see...
M	WIDE ANGLE	They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs
M	CONTROL CONSOLE	A hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts. It's standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered He goes back to the control console, scanning across the He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
M	YOUNG GALLO	Well, if you're gonna be captain... what are we gonna do now? Off his look...
M	GALLO	What is a King... without his Queen. He hits the control panel switch and...
