M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CUSTOMER	Wow. How do they do that? CONTINUED: 2
M	OWNER	It's an accident. It means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage. The flaws create the unusual coloring.
M	CUSTOMER	Can you arrange something for me with those?
M	OWNER	Of course. What kind of price range are you looking for?
F	TESS	Well, it's for my parent's anniversary. They don't know I'm coming. I just want it to be beautiful. Can you just do whatever you think looks best?
M	OWNER	I'll need a few minutes.
F	TESS	Take your time, please. And thank you.
M	OWNER	That should be some surprise.
F	TESS	Which?
M	OWNER	For your parents.
F	TESS	Oh. Yes. I hope so.
M	OWNER	Which one is it?
F	TESS	I'm sorry?
M	OWNER	Anniversary.
F	TESS	Oh. Fortieth
M	OWNER	Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea. Something classic.
F	TESS	Do you have a bathroom?
M	OWNER	Straight back, on the left. It's unisex.
F	TESS	Thank you.
M	OWNER	It's unisex!
M	DANNY	Miguel Diaz speaking. Tess, Tess. It's okay. You remember what we talked about, if this happened? All right. Call me in twenty-four hours on that number.
M	BENEDICT	The Baldwins.
F	TESS	What about them?
M	BENEDICT	We had dinner with them three years ago. You talked about your parent's anniversary. I'm getting married next month.
F	TESS	So am I. CONTINUED: 6
M	BENEDICT	Well, I hope Danny is as good as he thinks he is. A bouquet toss in prison can get pretty ugly.
M	REUBEN	I really think you're being too sensitive. She's crazy about you. I can tell.
M	REUBEN	Joyce, she's ninety-two. I'm all she has left. The wheelchair thing was an accident, she's having some trouble with the joystick. I'll adjust it. I told you, when her mouth hangs open like that, that means she's happy. I am. When are you coming over? CONTINUED: 10 You're tired because you work too much. You don't have to work all the time. Don't you want to take a break? Those trays look so heavy. Of course. How could you ask that? Because when I heard you laugh, all my problems disappeared.
M	TURK	The opening doesn't work.
F	VIRGIL	Duh.
M	TURK	She shouldn't have the same dream as Franklin. He's the antagonist. CONTINUED: 13
F	VIRGIL	It was your idea.
M	TURK	No it wasn't.
F	VIRGIL	Well, it wasn't mine. It couldn't be; it's too stupid.
M	TURK	Why do you do that? why do you have to get personal?
F	VIRGIL	It's not personal, it's a fact.
M	TURK	It's personal. You don't argue logically. You attack. Bring the right foot back even with the left, buttocks raised high.... ...you have to have reasons, to support your argument... ...flattening the back so the body forms a triangle.
F	VIRGIL	I can't listen to you anymore. It makes me physically sick.
M	TURK	Relax the crown of the head toward the floor. Draw the hips away from the hands, len--gthening the spine. And press the heels toward the floor. CONTINUED: 14
F	VIRGIL	This a serious class. No pigs allowed. Okay?
M	GUY	Sorry.
M	TURK	Virge.
M	TURK	You're hallucinating.
F	VIRGIL	Yeah, whatever, OJ.
M	RUSTY	You are kidding me.
M	RUSTY	736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix. I watched it. Rusty. What do you want from me?
M	RUSTY	I want what I paid for.
M	FELIX	And that's what I sent.
M	RUSTY	No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And if my workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure. But I'm at sea level, Felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. If it's pure, that is. Which this isn't.
M	FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)	Well, I didn't know you were going to liquefy it.
M	RUSTY	Christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to Christo, "Well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of Australia"? CONTINUED: 17
M	FELIX	Who's Christo?
M	RUSTY	Felix, you're in a shame spiral. Have your assistant lose my number. My god. How long you gonna give us?
M	BENEDICT	Four weeks.
M	FRANK	We stole that money fair and square. You bought people off to find me. You took advantage during an economic downturn, and made them say some shit they shouldn't have said. It's not fair, it's not just, and it aint' cool. Did you hear what I just said? CONTINUED: 19
M	BENEDICT	I heard what you said, Frank. Did you hear what I said?
M	LIVINGSTON	How many people here tonight were stupid enough to have children?
M	LIVINGSTON (cont'd)	Wow. No, seriously, that's great. I have a child. A daughter. She's five. They get to you, right? Am I right? Like emotionally. I mean, sometimes she'll turn to me with her little face and her little shiny eyes, and she'll say, "Daddy, please stop hitting me," and it just breaks my heart.'
M	LIVINGSTON (cont'd)	I'm Livingston Dell. Thanks for listening. See you at ten.
M	LIVINGSTON (cont'd)	I appreciate you letting me finish my run. You've been very patient.
M	BENEDICT	What can I say? You're a funny guy.
F	SAUL	What it is about horses? I ask you. Is it the strength? The beauty? The fearlessness? The grace? Of course. But there's something else. Something in the eyes.
M	SAUL (cont'd)	Yes. When I look into a horse's eyes, I can tell: This one's a winner.
M	WAITER	Excuse me, Mr. Bloom?
F	SAUL	Yes?
M	WAITER	There appears to be a problem with your card.
F	SAUL	You take Visa?
M	WAITER	I was acting on instructions from your business manager.
F	SAUL	My business manager? CONTINUED: 23
M	WAITER	Mr. Benedict.
M	BENEDICT	Look at it this way...Eugene....if the album goes platinum it'll cover what you owe. And if the second one goes gold, that should cover the interest.
M	LINUS	I'm responsible for myself. I have my own life and my own plans. I've never asked for anything but a fair shake. We make a deal, I stick to the deal. CONTINUED: 28 I just need to be absolutely clear that we have an understanding: If you contact my father, I'll kill myself, and you'll never get the rest of your money.
M	DANNY	How many can't make the deadline?
M	REUBEN	So I'm smarter than those schmucks on Wall Street. Whose fault is that?
M	DANNY	How many think if they run, they'll be found? CONTINUED: 31 Well, the only other--
M	RUSTY	We're on the five o'clock.
M	DANNY	Good. Where?
M	RUSTY	Amsterdam.
M	DANNY	AMSTERDAM!? I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS A DEATH SENTENCE!
M	RUSTY	FINE, THEN STAY HERE!
M	LIVINGSTON	Flight 144 to Amsterdam.
M	KLM AGENT	You're in seat 43J. Enjoy your flight.
M	LIVINGSTON	Uh...there must be some mistake. I mean...unless...is your first class section in the back of the plane?
M	KLM AGENT	No. 32E. 41C and D. 55K.
F	SAUL	Fifty-five K? There's a fifty-five K?
M	KLM AGENT	We've increased capacity by employing advanced design technology.
F	SAUL	You made the seats smaller. Can you just say that? You made the seats smaller. CONTINUED: 32
M	FRANK	See, you're not hearing me. What I'm trying to tell you is the reservations agent made a mistake when she issued the ticket, because on the rare occasions that I fly commercially, I always book a first- class ticket with no restrictions--
M	KLM AGENT	She may have, air, but this is the only ticket available to you on this flight. I need you to step aside so I can take care of the next customer.
M	FRANK	Now, listen: Don't make me get black.
M	DANNY	Reuben.
M	REUBEN	I wanted to wish you luck. And listen: I want to do something for you.
M	DANNY	What's this? CONTINUED: 33
M	REUBEN	Take it. Take it. This is the least I can do. I've got a friend who owns the Bellagio of Amsterdam and I've made reservations for all of you there. It's all taken care of.
M	RUSTY	That's very touching, Reuben.
M	REUBEN	It's the least I could do. I love you guys. Enjoy. No, thank you.
F	VIRGIL	Nice.
M	TURK	Great anticipation.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Gentlemen, you'll have to go back to your seats now.
M	LINUS	Ground level. First floor. Day one. Planning stages. Planning stages.
M	LIVINGSTON	How'd he get that seat?
M	TURK	What seat? CONTINUED: 34
M	RUSTY	Call me an elitist asshole, call me a bourgeois clown, call me anything you want, but 'economy' is bullshit.
M	DANNY	Oh, I don't know...it's not that ba-
M	LINUS	Hey. You guys have a minute?
M	DANNY	Sure, Linus.
M	RUSTY	What's on your mind?
M	LINUS	Well, I know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up, but I've been thinking about...well, about where I want to be in five years, career-wise, and I've decided I really want to be more than just a role-player. I really see myself as kind of an idea man, like you guys. I mean, I know you do your part and you're in the trenches with us and all, but it's really your show, and like I said, five years from now, I want to be running my own show....
M	DANNY RUSTY	Uh-huh. Right.
M	LINUS	So if there's any opportunity for me to be involved in the, you know, planning stages of things, I would really appreciate it. I really feel like I'm ready for more responsibility and that I could really make a contribution.
M	RUSTY	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
M	DANNY	Evelyn.
M	RUSTY	We're negotiating the terms with her tomorrow. You feel up to taking the lead?
M	LINUS	Are you serious?
M	DANNY	Absolutely.
M	LINUS	This isn't some gag?
M	RUSTY	No gag.
M	LINUS	Wow. Yeah. That would be awesome.
M	DANNY	Okay, then.
M	LINUS	Man. I wasn't sure if I should say anything. Now I'm glad I did.
M	DANNY	So are we.
M	RUSTY	We're here to listen.
M	LINUS	Great. Thanks. Really. You won't regret this.
M	BASHER	Tom.
F	SAUL	He can be a Tom?
M	BASHER	Anybody can be a Tom.
F	SAUL	You gotta make your own opportunities. This ain't a rehearsal.
M	BASHER	Tom.
F	SAUL	Boy, you're tough.
M	BASHER	Stop calling me "boy". CONTINUED: 36
M	LIVINGSTON	How could he lie to us like that?
M	RUSTY	The sign said 'the Bellagio of Amsterdam'.
M	LINUS (?)	Wait a minute. That's it?
M	DANNY	Yeah.
M	LINUS	Look, you guys no frills, no perks, run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I said no problem because I believed you were right that we shouldn't go deeper into debt and spend money we don't have. I mean, am I the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing? That we could use a little humility? That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job? Okay, I grant you that maybe this isn't what we deserve, but maybe it's what we need. We can do this. No, I take it back: We have to do this. CONTINUED: 38
F	TESS	What are you doing in Amsterdam? Only what I have to do to get Benedict off our backs.
F	TESS	Be careful, Danny. Please.
M	DANNY	How's work?
F	TESS	It's the same. I'm distracted.
M	DANNY	I'm sorry.
F	TESS	It's not your fault. I keep trying to figure out what I did wrong. How did he find us?
F	TESS	Danny, don't keep thinking about it.
M	DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.)	I did something wrong. He should never have found us. CONTINUED: 40
F	TESS	I'll call you tomorrow. I love you.
M	DANNY	I love you.
M	RUSTY	She'll try and use her looks to distract you. Don't let her.
M	DANNY	Be polite, but firm.
M	LINUS	Right.
M	RUSTY	Don't get soft on us. Don't make too many concessions.
M	LINUS	I won't. CONTINUED: 44
M	EVELYN	The onset of summer is like a woman who owns too many shoes.
M	DANNY	If animals were capable of flattery, the World Bank would be open until 8pm.
M	EVELYN	When I was four years old, I saw my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy.
M	RUSTY	A doctor who specializes in skin diseases will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television. Later he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his dream.
M	LINUS	O let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreams. I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been.
M	EVELYN	Your young friend has a great deal to learn about respect.
M	DANNY	Linus...why don't you wait outside.
M	DANNY	Is that your idea of making a contribution?
M	RUSTY	Her terms were scandalous. And we were lucky to get them after what you said.
M	DANNY	The deal was this close to being blown.
M	LINUS	"Deal?" What "deal?" I know what you guys are doing. Look. That...person had too many cupcakes. I was playing along.
M	RUSTY	"Playing along!"
M	DANNY	You called her mother a whore.
M	RUSTY	A really cheap one.
M	LINUS	Guys, I'm not falling for this. I'm not.... CONTINUED: 45 I mean...
M	LINUS (cont'd)	I called her mother a whore?
M	RUSTY	It's a privately owned home. But don't let that fool you. It's extremely well-protected.
F	SAUL	What are we after?
M	DANNY	A document. A very old, very valuable document.
F	VIRGIL	What is it?
M	RUSTY	A stock certificate.
M	DANNY	The first one ever issued, from the first corporation on the planet. The Dutch East India Trading Company. It's the only one of it's kind and it's worth a boat-load.
M	TURK	2.7 million after expenses. CONTINUED: 46
M	TURK	Each?
F	VIRGIL	Who negotiated this?
M	LINUS	Thanks.
M	LIVINGSTON	What do we know so far?
M	DANNY	There's a dummy key pad by the front door. But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr. Vanderspeigle's second floor office. Now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code. Evelyn gave it to us.
M	FRANK	That's not good news, that's really good news.
F	VIRGIL	We just wait until he leaves.
M	DANNY	Yeah, well...that's the bad news.
M	RUSTY	He doesn't.
M	DANNY	He's agoraphobic.
M	LIVINGSTON	So he's never been out of his house? Ever? CONTINUED 47 Not once since he moved in ten years ago.
M	SAUL (V.O.)	Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Cracks his windows at night...that's about it.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	Can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Negative. It's a closed-loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy's bedroom.
M	BASHER (V.O.)	Could we use a remote device to trigger the panel?
M	DANNY (V.O.)	It's hard-wired and shielded.
M	TURK	Guys, am I missing something here? We know his damn code, right? You're telling me with that much information we can't find a way into this freak's house?
M	TURK	Can't we just get a telephone repair truck... ...put the basket up and use a telescoping rod through the open window to tap out the guy's code?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	The street in front of the house is blocked off to vehicles.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	And it's covered by five independently-wired surveillance cameras.... Monitored 24-hours a day by a security company.
F	SAUL	God, this guy really is a freak.
M	BASHER	Crazy freak.
M	DANNY	Something wrong?
M	FRANK	Just...don't call the guy a freak, okay?
M	FRANK (cont'd)	What? CONTINUED: 50 What?! I mean, am I the only one here who feels funny about stealing from a...a...handicapped guy?
M	DANNY	Yeah. Okay, so we know what we can't do... Time to think outside the box, guys.
M	LINUS	Okay, here's something...I've got an idea...suppose we--
M	RUSTY	No.
M	LINUS	Well, but how--
M	RUSTY	There's a Goldmann Grid over the enitre surface. Is that what you were thinking about?
M	DANNY	But....
M	RUSTY	--Well, that's different. Especially if we--
M	DANNY	Right.
M	LINUS	What?
M	RUSTY	A Schuman Special. Livingston--
M	LIVINGSTON	Absolutely. I mean, I'd need a day to--
M	RUSTY	You'll have three. Basher?
M	BASHER	No worries.
M	RUSTY	Virgil, Turk.
M	VIRGIL.	Just gotta get the gear.
M	TURK	Sweden.
M	RUSTY	Yen? What, and give up show business? Saul--
F	SAUL	I know, I know. I'll be bored. You'll be fine.
M	RUSTY	Clock's running.
M	LINUS	What's a Schuman Special?
M	LIVINGSTON	Your shot has to hit directly above the keypad.
M	BASHER	Let me see the specs.
M	BASHER	How tall is the surface of this roof?
F	SAUL	About 87 feet.
M	BASHER	How tall exactly? CONTINUED: 53
M	RUSTY	You're not going to believe this.
M	DANNY	Try me.
M	RUSTY	We don't have line-of-sight.
M	DANNY	What?
M	RUSTY	We tried everywhere. Some places we're only three or four inches off...but...there's no straight shot. Even with Basher. It's literally impossible.
M	LINUS	Can I talk to you guys for a second?
M	LINUS	Listen, I've done a little research on the Schuman Special, and uh...we don't have line of sight for the shot.
M	DANNY	What?
M	RUSTY	Jesus. This'll kill us.
M	DANNY	Listen: Don't say anything. If you're ever going to run your own crew, you've got to remember to never show weakness.
M	RUSTY	It's like blood in the water for these guys.
M	DANNY	If they think you're slipping, you won't even see it coming.
M	RUSTY	But hey--thanks.
M	RUSTY	I need some air.
M	DANNY	The Swinging Priest?
M	RUSTY	Not enough time.
M	DANNY	Crazy Larry.
M	RUSTY	Too many variables.
M	DANNY	Robinov's Revenge?
M	RUSTY	Too many obstacles.
M	DANNY	The Soft Shoulder.
M	RUSTY	Not enough people.
M	DANNY	Baker's Dozen.
M	RUSTY	We'd need a woman.
M	DANNY	Hell in a Handbasket. CONTINUED: 54
M	RUSTY	Can't train the cat that quickly.
M	DANNY	I can't have my wife watch me hauled off in handcuffs again.
M	RUSTY	It's always about you, isn't it?
M	DANNY	This like running toward a cliff. Speaking of which, how's Isabel?
M	RUSTY	I have no idea what you're talking about.
M	DANNY	You get the tattoo removed?
M	RUSTY	Given its location, my doctor advised against it.
M	DANNY	What are you doing?
M	RUSTY	We're here.
M	DANNY	Oh.
M	DANNY	Nice. You want to do what? CONTINUED: 55
M	RUSTY	Tilt it. Raise it slightly.
F	SAUL	The whole house?
M	RUSTY	It's only a few inches.
M	BASHER	Then I'll have line-of-sight.
M	FRANK	We can't tilt a whole house.
F	VIRGIL	They did it with the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
M	RUSTY	Exactly.
F	SAUL	It took three hundred guys two years to do that. You're crazy. Nobody's ever done anything like this.
M	RUSTY	Not true. Palowski did it in `64 in Venice and `73 in Istanbul.
F	SAUL	Really?
M	LIVINGSTON	And he only had a crew of six.
M	RUSTY	There are thirty pylons. We cut them, insert the jacks, and crank.
M	BASHER	For nineteen hours. Here's the order in which they have to be done.
M	LIVINGSTON	So, Basher approached me about being on a crew.
M	FRANK	When?
M	LIVINGSTON	Yesterday. CONTINUED: 58
M	RUSTY	The good news is, after the first twelve hours, I stopped being able to smell anything.
M	DANNY	Took a few more for me.
M	RUSTY	This water was stagnant six hundred years ago.
F	VIRGIL	There's no reason for him not to. He would go to the cops.
M	TURK	Okay, so he goes to the cops.
F	VIRGIL	Then they arrest Dominique.
M	TURK.	Right.
F	VIRGIL	Then we have no story.
M	TURK	Right.
M	LINUS	She steals the money from Mr. Mulroney.
M	TURK	What?
F	VIRGIL	Why would she? CONTINUED: (2) 58
M	LINUS	To pay Franklin to keep quiet.
M	TURK	That's good.
F	SAUL	Counterfeiting? Me? I have to tell you, it's not something I condone. It's cheating.
M	BASHER	It is cheating.
F	SAUL	There's no subtlety to it.
M	BASHER	It's kind of embarrassing.
F	SAUL	No one I know...
M	BASHER	I can't imagine anything like that.
F	SAUL	Not bad.
M	BASHER	Bolivia.
F	SAUL	Diego's people?
M	BASHER	Yeah. CONTINUED: 59
F	SAUL	Well. Congratulations.
M	BASHER	I told him about you.
F	SAUL	I'm too old. That's dangerous. My stuff is cheap compared to that. It's just me and my gal, you know. What you're talking about is organized. But thanks, anyway.
M	FRANK	Jay Leno called.
M	LIVINGSTON	When are you gonna stop with that tired "white people can't be funny stuff"? It's so old, Frank, really. Do you want some orange juice? I got the good kind. Augie One, this is Condor.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	This is Augie One; Go Condor.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	We're fully cranked here. Let's go to phase two. CONTINUED: 62
M	FRANK	Bring that orange juice.
F	SAUL	This is Gatsby. We're green here.
F	ISABEL	Let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals. The highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world. Between six and ten high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time. Worldwide, no more than twenty. The most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him. The good news is the trend is toward their extinction. CONTINUED: 65
F	ISABEL	For example: Anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable.
F	ISABEL	Their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen. They tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate.
F	ISABEL	Those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for growth or freedom. Their lives are treated as secondary. Many of them suffer from depression. It's a crime for which there is no law, and yet causes untold damage. WHAT? CONTINUED: 66
F	ISABEL	That's impossible!
M	PAUL	Thanks for coming. We can really use your help on this one.
F	ISABEL	I hope the scene hasn't been contaminated.
F	ISABEL	No forced entry.
M	PAUL	Not that we can find.
M	PAUL	We can't figure out how they disabled the alarm. We thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow. CONTINUED: 69
F	ISABEL	No, that would have triggered the system. And damaged the circuits.
M	PAM	Well, then I don't know how they got in.
F	ISABEL	They had to have known the code.
M	PAUL	We considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him. He programmed the last seven steps of the system himself. He set it and never left the house again. When he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line.
F	ISABEL	There are other ways to get the code. Closed loop. Redundant servers. Titanium encasement. Not bad.
M	PAUL	Like what?
F	ISABEL	Uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars.
M	PAUL	Actually, I don't know about that. Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this-- --then his body would block the view from across the canal.
F	ISABEL	That's why they probably set up over there-- --And used the mirror. I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but--
M	PAUL	What is it? What is that?
F	ISABEL	It's where the crossbow bolt hit.
M	PAUL	A crossbow bolt?
F	ISABEL	Ever heard of Franz Schuman?
M	PAUL	No. CONTINUED: 73
F	ISABEL	They would have fired from that roof. Through this open window.
M	PAUL	From that roof, through this window? Nobody could make a shot like that.
F	ISABEL	Not a cop, anyway.
M	PAUL	What's that supposed to mean?
F	ISABEL	Sorry. Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood.
M	PAUL	He's an idiot. You shouldn't let him bother you.
F	ISABEL	Yes. You're right. But these man are exceptionally good. Even when they make mistakes. CONTINUED: 74
F	ISABEL	When did he get up and notice the certificate was gone?
M	PAUL	The alarm woke him at 4:2O am.
F	ISABEL	But the alarm would have been-- Oh... Oh, I know what happened.
M	PAUL	What? CONTINUED: 77
F	ISABEL	There was someone else.
M	PAUL	Someone else.
M	ISABEL (V.O.)	Oh, I wish I could've have seen that.
M	ISABEL (V.O.)	That must have really been something.
M	DANNY	Wait! Wait! Shhhh! CONTINUED: 79
M	DINNER JACKET	Can I help you?
M	DANNY	Yeah. What the hell are you doing?
M	DINNER JACKET	I am getting here first.
M	RUSTY	This is our score.
M	DINNER JACKET	I am here before you.
M	FRANK	We let you in the house! Somehow you got in after we hit the code but before we got to the door.
M	DINNER JACKET	That's thirty seconds. How could I know which exact thirty seconds I had? Unless I knew you plan. Could I have known your plan? Do you have a snitch in your group?
M	DANNY	No.
M	RUSTY	We don't.
M	DINNER JACKET	Yes, I know you don't. Because I saw, the whole thing from that chair. I knew you were around, but I had my own plan.
M	DINNER JACKET	There's really no need for that.
M	DANNY	Listen, we have to come to some arrangement.
M	LINUS	We've incurred some very serious costs here.
M	LINUS	Well, we have.
M	DINNER JACKET	Every second I am becoming more outnumbered.
F	VIRGIL	Who's this?
M	FRANK	He said he got here first.
F	VIRGIL	That's bullshit.
M	RUSTY	Hey. Mouth.
F	VIRGIL	This is our goddamned job!
M	LIVINGSTON	If the situation were reversed--
M	DINNER JACKET	But the situation is not reversed. The situation is that I am here first, without any help from you. CONTINUED: (3) 79
M	DINNER JACKET	So as much as I would--
M	DINNER JACKET	Jesus, how many of you are there?
M	DANNY	Just give us the stock certificate. Whatever else you took out of that safe...it's yours.
M	DINNER JACKET	No. But: I leave you with something.
M	DINNER JACKET	My attorney. In case Evelyn's employer tries anything...well, anything.
M	PAUL	Are you sure?
F	ISABEL	I'm sure there's another scenario that would fit these physical details, but I don't know what it is.
M	PAUL	Where should we start? CONTINUED: 80
F	ISABEL	You can start by picking that guy up.
F	VIRGIL	Who the hell was that guy?
M	FRANK	It's going to get out, you know. People are going to find out.
M	BASHER	Somebody must know this bloke's name.
M	LIVINGSTON	The question is who trained him. He got into that place alone.
M	DANNY	He says.
M	FRANK	I believed him.
F	SAUL	You think he's better than us?
M	FRANK	I'm not saying anything, but the man was sitting there, waiting for us.
M	LINUS	Do you think the cops even know who this guys is?
M	RUSTY	Please. That guy's never even seen a cop.
M	TURK	Maybe he works with the cops. CONTINUED: 81
F	SAUL	You don't work with the cops unless you absolutely have to. And not even then.
M	BASHER	Either way, he's got to have a name.
M	LIVINGSTON	It can't be that hard to find out who this guy is. Like I said, somebody trained him. Who trains the best?
M	DANNY	LeMarc. Right?
M	RUSTY	If he's not dead.
M	LINUS	Who's LeMarc? CONTINUED: 84
M	ONDERDONK	Fucking stone.
M	DAVENPECK	I'm not quitting.
M	ONDERDONK	Who said quitting. I'm tired.
F	ISABEL	Can I speak to him?
M	DAVENPECK	Who are you?
M	DAVENPECK	Apparently, you can do whatever you want with him.
M	ONDERDONK	Are you moving him?
F	ISABEL	Oh no. I just need to speak with him. To get some information.
M	DAVENPECK	We've been on him for six hours.
M	ONDERDONK	With our best stuff.
M	DAVENPECK	Our best stuff. In mind terms, we've been torturing this guy.
F	ISABEL	I'm sure. I only need a moment, then I'll be out of your way. CONTINUED: (2) 84
M	DANNY (INTO PHONE)	It's not a problem, it's a hiccup. It won't affect our schedule that much. I want to talk about you, not the job. How are you doing?
M	DANNY	Tess, I've got to call you back.
M	DANNY	Coming. CONTINUED: 85
M	RUSTY	Who is it?
F	ISABEL	Hello, Robert.
M	RUSTY	Isabel.
M	LINUS	"Robert?" Is that his real name?
M	LINUS	How does she know that?
M	LIVINGSTON	Ex-girlfriend.
M	BASHER & SAUL	Fiancee.
M	RUSTY	It's great to see you.
F	ISABEL	Is it? Because you've been seeing a lot of me lately.
F	ISABEL	You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my apartment on Wednesday night. CONTINUED: 86
F	ISABEL	You were hiding in the bushes when I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella.
F	ISABEL	This one...I'm not even sure where this one was taken, but I like it a lot. Very Ron Gallela.
F	ISABEL	I mean, if I didn't know better I'd think you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known as the world's first stock certificate. You must have been so proud of yourselves. A Schuman Special. It's been awhile. That was a very handsome crossbow shot, Eugene.
F	ISABEL	And the Palowski...whose idea was that?
M	RUSTY	We didn't steal anything.
F	ISABEL	Oh...I know you didn't. Somebody beat you to it. One man. No crew. No back up. Tell me something -- just so I can get the full picture in my head -- was he wearing a tuxedo? A white dinner jacket? CONTINUED: (2) 86
M	BASHER	At least we saw him in the flesh. You'll never see this guy your whole life.
F	ISABEL	So you know who he is?
M	DANNY	Of course we know who he is.
F	ISABEL	Well, then. I'll see you when you see him. To get your certificate back.
M	LIVINGSTON	Who's hat is that?
F	SAUL	How did she-- That was--
M	DANNY	This is what I was talking about. This is exactly what I was talking--
M	RUSTY	--I was just checking up on her. I knew she didn't want to see me. I was being polite.
M	TURK	Where did she learn all that stuff? The Palowski stuff.
M	DANNY	Her father.
F	VIRGIL	He was a cop?
M	RUSTY	Thief.
M	LINUS	Was he good?
M	DANNY	Very.
M	FRANK	Great.
F	VIRGIL	What's the big deal? She's just some brilliant, pissed-off ex- girlfriend who's dad taught her every trick in the book.
M	SAUL & BASHER	Fiancee.
M	TURK	But did you see that display of emotion, handing out those pictures?
F	VIRGIL	Totally unprofessional.
M	RUSTY	She's passionate.
F	VIRGIL	She's unbalanced.
M	RUSTY	Her job is very stressful.
F	SAUL	She could reduce her stress by leaving us alone.
M	DANNY	We've got to slow her down.
M	DANNY	But first: We find our French friend and introduce ourselves.
M	FUNKY TRANSITION	TO:
M	ISABEL'S BOSS	Twenty-four hours. You know that.
F	ISABEL	I don't have twenty-four hours. They're there now. They'll lead me to him.
M	ISABEL'S BOSS	You also know that you can go now, if you don't take your secretary. When there's liability, I need a document.
M	HESS	He said we can't leave until tomorrow because of liability issues and he needs a document.
F	ISABEL	Yes.
M	HESS	Thanks for trying.
F	ISABEL	Let's share a car.
M	HESS	That would be nice. Thank you.
F	ISABEL	I can't believe they won't make an exception. I've got to find out who this other guy is.
M	ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	Fantastic.
M	BASHER (V.O.)	He did his first big job in 1989. Bundesbank, Berlin.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	The fifteen million dollar one the day the Berlin wall fell? He was nineteen years old.
M	ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	Where do you want to go this weekend?
M	BASHER (V.O.)	Bank Faltier, Paris 190 and again in '91.... Total take twenty-one million euros. Bank of Italy '92. Eighteen million. Danish Treasury, also 192. Twenty-two million. CONTINUED: 92 Prado museum. Madrid '93.... The Picasso. Estimated value--
M	SAUL (V.O.)	Hang on a second! He-- All of them?! He's not done. Wait -- Prado Museum, the Picasso -- that was Moretti.
M	BASHER (V.O.)	He in Moretti. It's one of his aliases.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Anything else?
M	BASHER (V.O.)	UDC bank in Geneva, `94. Nineteen million in bearer bonds. The Louvre --'95 and twice in '96.
M	BASHER (V.O.)	He left a Post-It note on the Mona Lisa that said "Bitch set me up." Tell them about Saint Tropez.
M	BASHER (V.O.)	In 2000, he stole the King of Morocco's 230 foot yacht. Vanished into thin air. Crew surfaced a few days later in a life raft. Couldn't remember a thing. CONTINUED: 94 How do you hide a two hundred foot yacht?! If the King knows, he's not telling. He received it back a month later.
M	ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	How far is your house, Baron?
F	TOULOUR	Twenty minutes by helicopter.
M	TURK (V.O.)	One guy did all those jobs?
M	VIRGIL (V.O.)	How'd he get all those aliases?
M	BASHER (V.O.)	Until a month ago Interpol were convinced that the heists were the work of twelve different people. But not any more.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	The French national police just gave him a nickname. "Le Renard Nuit" -- The Night Fox.
M	BASHER	Scotland Yard said he's the new LeMarc.
M	RUSTY	Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Personal information?
M	LINUS (V.O.)	Some say he's one of these guys that thinks because he was born in a penthouse, he controls the elevator business. Others say he turned out okay when you consider how rich his parents were. Taxes over here are brutal. People don't realize.
M	LINUS (V.O.)	Father was a big-time industrialist, got into the cellphone market on the ground floor. Mother inherited. Had maids as a child. He's a public figure, people know who he is. He's been rumored to run for office in Spain, even though he doesn't appear to live there.
M	ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	What do you have in there, the Mona Lisa?
F	TOULOUR	Please.
M	ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	You know what? I don't like that painting either. I don't like anything Van Gogh did. CONTINUED: 98
M	LINUS (V.O.)	He's an avid golfer, pro-level tennis player, and inveterate gambler. But apparently his favorite pastime is....
M	DANNY	What?
M	RUSTY	Spit it out, Linus.
M	LINUS	He's rarely alone. I think it's a compulsion. I have a list of names here...it was just the first week.
M	DANNY	All right, moving on, is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we--
M	BASHER	Did we forget to mention he's a Viscount?
M	DANNY	A what?
M	LIVINGSTON	Viscount. As in nobility. CONTINUED: 101
M	DANNY	Last time I checked titles like that went out with a little number I like to call the French Revolution--
M	BASHER	Spain.
M	DANNY	What?
M	BASHER	His title. It's Spanish. Mother's cousin.
M	DANNY	He may be the greatest thief in Europe. He may have slept with half of the EU. He may be a Casanova with the soul of a starving artist. It doesn't matter.
M	DANNY	There's something he cares about. There's something he can't live without. CONTINUED: 106
M	EDMUNDS	Are you on steroids?
M	EDMUND	Let's try again. Give me five games this time.
F	TOULOUR	You are worse than Sampras. You should be paying me.
F	BUTLER	Pardon me, sir.
F	BUTLER	Two gentlemen. They say they met you in Amsterdam last week.
F	TOULOUR	Put them on the veranda and get them a drink. I'll be right up.
F	TOULOUR	Rusty. CONTINUED: 108 Danny.
M	DANNY	Other way around.
F	TOULOUR	Are you sure? Usually I'm so good at that.
F	TOULOUR	This is Edmund. Edmund. Rusty. Danny.
M	DANNY	Nice to meet you. Edmund. You a tennis pro?
M	EDMUND	Actually, no, I'm the King of Morocco.
F	TOULOUR	Sadly, I can't show you my favorite painting of all -- a Degas that used to hang right there -- because it was stolen recently.
M	DANNY	That's awful.
M	RUSTY	The criminal element is everywhere these days.
M	DANNY	Listen, Francois-- CONTINUED: 109
F	TOULOUR	Please. Call me Baron.
M	DANNY	We came here for the Vanderspeigle certificate--
F	TOULOUR	That's not for sale.
M	DANNY	Your Degas is worth three times that. You want your painting back, you're going to have to trade.
F	TOULOUR	You actually expect me to believe that you are in possession of my Degas? You are living in a...in a bubble.
M	BASHER	He used the word "amateur"?
F	VIRGIL	You said we could show him the painting right, to prove that we had it.
M	DANNY	Yes.
M	RUSTY	He still wouldn't trade.
M	FRANK	We need to teach him a lesson. CONTINUED: 110
M	TURK	Absolutely.
M	DANNY	All right, let's stay calm. We don't need to over-react here. He said some disrespectful things, that's true. But why antagonize this guy? Why get into something with him? He's young and he's filthy rich, and he's got time on his hands. We don't want to become his Betty noir. We can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate.
M	BASHER	It's about reputation. You said so yourself. We have to get that certificate to Evelyn's buyer or--
M	DANNY	We'll make enough selling the Degas to pay off her buyer--
M	FRANK	Then why did you make that trip down there in the first place, if you didn't want to get into something?
M	DANNY	Saul?
F	SAUL	Turn his name over to Isabel. In exchange for getting off our backs.
F	SAUL	Short of that...the only appropriate response is to steal his next job right out from under him. Just like he did to us.
M	TURK	We don't even know our next job.
M	DANNY	We got ten million in that closet.
M	DANNY	I cash in the Degas, take a moment to think about our next move. Toulour isn't going anywhere. You guys are hyping him too much, you're letting him get inside your head. Why do I need to see all these guys? When I tracked the Munch down in Sweden I got all the approvals I needed with one phone call. CONTINUED: 114 With Lenin's shaving kit the Russians brought me in and it took a single signature and I got it at the airport a minute after I arrived. What's so goddamned special about the French?
M	HESS	Without their signatures, you can't do anything. You can't pull the suspects over, you can't do surveillance on them, you're not even allowed to contact them. They're real sticklers about sovereignty issues here.
M	INSPECTOR	Isabel, I couldn't possibly sign those documents in good conscience without talking to you about the case in detail. I realize you're in a hurry and my schedule for the rest of the day is quite full, so perhaps, if you're interested in being expedient, we could discuss the case...over dinner.
M	HESS	Foucquet's at eight-thirty. Apparently their's a private room. Better bring your kevlar. Don't stop for that. CONTINUED: 117
M	DANNY	That's not how I want to go.
F	TOULOUR	No.
F	TOULOUR	Very theatrical of you...asking to meet here. Like we're spies meeting to do an exchange.
M	DANNY	Why are you doing this to us?
F	TOULOUR	Doing what?
M	DANNY	This is a game for you. For us it's survival. Are you that bored? I mean...
F	TOULOUR	No. I wouldn't do that. No... The truth is...I made a bet. Or maybe a better word is a "wager".
M	DANNY	What kind of wager?
F	TOULOUR	A gentlemen's wager with a friend of mine -- my mentor. A few months ago we were at his winter place in Nicaragua and another guest referred to me as "the greatest thief in the world." I didn't object, obviously, but my mentor fell silent. Later I asked him about it. He said if I really wanted to say I was the best thief...I'd have to prove I was better than the eleven of you. CONTINUED: 118 You know, the Benedict job made waves, even all the way over here. 16.3 million dollars. That's a lot of money.
M	DANNY	
F	TOULOUR	Sorry. 163. Before you were found.
F	TOULOUR	Yes, 163 million is a lot of money. It attracts attention. So, in a way, you brought this problem with me on yourselves. You're victims of your own success.
M	DANNY	Here's what I'm going to do. You tell me the name of your mentor. I'll call him up and I'll tell him that you're the greatest thief in the world...that I accept that to be true.... And in return...you leave us alone, let us go about our business. How about that?
F	TOULOUR	He said you'd probably say something like that -- but he said you'd probably have your fingers crossed when you said it.
M	TOULOUR (CONT'D)	So in this situation -- for the purposes of my wager -- words aren't good enough. I have to prove this on the ground.
M	DANNY	This mentor of yours...was he a good thief in his day?
F	TOULOUR	Who, LeMarc? CONTINUED: 119
M	DANNY	Yeah. Him.
M	LIVINGSTON	Who?
M	RUSTY	I thought so too.
F	SAUL	LeMarc. The LeMarc.
F	SAUL	God hates me. He hates all of us.
M	FRANK	Hell, this could go on forever.
M	DANNY	No. It's going to be settled by one more job. A single object.
F	SAUL	Whatever it is, let's just let him have it.
M	DANNY	We can't.
M	LIVINGSTON	Because of pride?
M	DANNY	Because we beat him, he'll pay Benedict off.
M	FRANK	Now we're talking. CONTINUED: 120
M	BASHER	One score, for the whole thing?
M	LIVINGSTON	What do we have to do? I mean, is it a fair bet or is it like...the Coronation Egg or something?
F	SAUL	He wants us to steal the Coronation Egg!
M	BASHER	That's just... that's...what is that?
F	SAUL	The Holy Grail.
M	RUSTY	Carl Faberge, the greatest goldsmith in history, constructed the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the wedding of Czar Nicholas and Alexandra. Every world class thief in the last 108 years has tried to steal it. No one has even come close.
F	SAUL	That's because it's cursed.
M	LINUS	What?
F	SAUL	It's un-stealable.
M	DANNY	It's the only thing in LeMarc's entire career that he went after but failed to get. He tried three times.
M	DANNY	We get the egg and we're free.
M	BASHER	That's great, except we can't get it.
F	SAUL	It's not possible.
M	DANNY	Then we go to jail.
F	VIRGIL	Well...where is it now?
F	ISABEL	I'm going to need surveillance on both hotels, phone taps, room bugs, people in the lobby and by every exit.
M	CARABINIERI OFFICER	Yes, absolutely.
F	ISABEL	If I had to guess I'd say I'll need at least 25 people, a dozen vehicles...and an on-call air unit.
M	CARABINIERI OFFICER	Yes, absolutely.
F	ISABEL	Okay, one more thing, and this is crucial: these guys are extremely, sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance, so we'll need real state of the art stuff. CONTINUED: 122 I'm talking synthetic aperture pinhole cameras, wave reformation mics with a high Plank coefficient and a passive input structure-- You're not writing anything down; are you sure you're getting all this?
M	CARABINIERI OFFICER	Yes, absolutely.
F	ISABEL	Okay. Good. Now what time am I meeting Captain Giordano?
M	CARABINIERI OFFICER	Yes...
F	ISABEL	No, what time?
M	CARABINIERI OFFICER	Yes...absolutely...
F	ISABEL	I see...so...you've spoken with the Pope and he's okay with autographing my breasts?
M	CARABINIERI OFFICER	Yes, absolutely.
M	DANNY	What am I looking at?
M	LIVINGSTON	A TR354 infra red motion detection system. It's the gold standard.
M	DANNY	Saul and Linus back yet?
M	LIVINGSTON	No.
M	DANNY	No?
M	LIVINGSTON	And I can't find Rusty. impossible to pick.
M	FRANK	What?
M	FRANK	Well, I don't know, but that's one nasty lock.
M	DANNY	Seen Rusty?
M	FRANK	We thought he was with you. CONTINUED: 125
M	BASHER	Not since we first got here. About an hour ago. And where's Saul and Linus?
F	ISABEL	Jesus, Robert. I could've killed you.
M	RUSTY	I'm older.
F	ISABEL	I hope so. What are you doing in my room?
M	RUSTY	I thought maybe we could get some coffee.
F	ISABEL	No, thanks.
M	RUSTY	Okay, how about a two week trip to Zanzibar?
F	ISABEL	Please don't. CONTINUED: 127
M	RUSTY	Fine, coffee then. Whatever you say.
F	ISABEL	Why do I want to have coffee with you?
M	RUSTY	How should I know? sorry about your mom. She was a real...
F	ISABEL	She hated you.
M	RUSTY	Well, she was nice enough to hide it from me. Some people can't even do that.
F	ISABEL	She hated everybody.
F	ISABEL	You'll never get it by the way.
M	RUSTY	Get what?
F	ISABEL	You'll think you've got it, you'll be so close that you'll be able to taste it and then this guy, the Night Fox or whoever he is, will just take it -- right out of your hand -- just like he did in Amsterdam. He's as good as LeMarc.
M	RUSTY	It's not possible.
F	ISABEL	You're in a bubble.
M	LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND)	No, that won't work either. The IR will pick it up before you even get close.
M	FRANK	Look, if we're having this much trouble, and we've got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hair out.
M	RUSTY	Would you call that bubble-shaped?
M	DANNY	What?
M	RUSTY	She pulled a gun on me. CONTINUED: 130 She won't back off.
M	FRANK	Are you back on?
M	RUSTY	I'm selling. She ain't buying.
M	DANNY	More importantly, what kind of reception is the Italian Police giving her?
M	SUBORDINATE OFFICER	Captain Giordano is handling an urgent interrogation. He'll be up as soon as it is completed. Please wait in here.
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED)	Naples sucks! They're a joke! The only decent player they have is Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy. Pasqualli runs circles around Bologna's backfield every time. ITALIAN COP 2 (SUBTITLED) Pasqualli could single-handedly-- Isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in.
F	ISABEL	What are they talking about? CONTINUED: 131
M	SUBORDINATE OFFICER	It's an internal matter, Madame.
M	ITALIAN COP 3 (O.S., SUBTITLED)	--and her friends could trounce NapIes! The clock on the wall reads 2:20 PM. Isabel's been here two
M	LIVINGSTON	Damn-it.
M	RUSTY	All right, okay. Let's not be defeatists.... What about that mirror trick that Akimbo tried at the--
M	LIVINGSTON	--There's no mirror thin enough to avoid tripping the lasers. CONTINUED: 134
M	DANNY	What's he doing now?
M	VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.)	Nothing. Just reading the papers at a cafe. Oh, no, wait. A woman just sat down next to him.... He's getting her phone number. Wow. What are those?
M	VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.)	Jimmy Chu.
M	TURK (RADIO V.O.)	I've never seen that color.
M	DANNY	Okay, take it easy over there.
M	DANNY	What happened?
M	LINUS	We thought someone was following us.
F	SAUL	We gave 'em the shake. Caught 'em napping.
M	SUBORDINATE OFFICER	Captain Giordano, Rome Police Special Investigations. Isabel Lahiri, Europol, Major Theft Task Force. CONTINUED: 135
F	ISABEL	...reason to believe these men... ...are going to try to steal the Coronation Egg when it is actually put on display next week. I need official authorization to surveil and pursue these suspected criminals on Italian soil.
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	Yes, absolutely.
F	ISABEL	And I'll need substantial resources from your department. Can I count on that?
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	Yes, absolutely.
F	ISABEL	So, Captain, what do you think of my skirt?
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	I think it's very beautiful. Why, don't you like it?
F	TOULOUR	I don't usually call for a second date. For you I make an exception.
M	DANNY	Thanks.
F	TOULOUR	I think it's good that we talk. You see, you should stop following me. You're wasting your time. I'm going to let you go first and get caught. Then they will increase the security even more, and then I will steal the Egg. Then Lemarc can make his decision.
M	DANNY	You sound confident.
F	TOULOUR	Confident? This is a very American word. I am arrogant. There's a difference.
M	DANNY	Doesn't matter if you're that good. Are you that good?
F	TOULOUR	I can move objects with my mind.
F	TOULOUR	You don't believe it?
M	DANNY	Do you?
F	TOULOUR	Are you done stirring your sugar?
M	DANNY	That's fantastic. Listen, I appreciate the call, and, best of luck.
F	TOULOUR	Danny. I'm serious. Sit down, please.
M	DANNY	You're telekinetic, is that what you're telling me?
F	TOULOUR	Yes. But...it's a curse. A nightmare. Everything is too easy. But then LeMarc says I'm still not the best. So I take his challenge. And you will fail, and I will win, and so what? What does it prove? What is he trying to show me?
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	Ms. Lahiri, you're in Italy now. We are a sovereign nation. We're not some adjunct, some administrative district of the EU. When Europol calls we don't jump up and tap dance for you. If you want to work in Italy, then you have to do it under Italian authority...and that means you have to talk to Commander Andriotti...who, I'm sure, will be happy to meet with you some time next week--
F	ISABEL	Next week!
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	--when he returns from vacation. CONTINUED: 139 He said he has to get approval from someone else and they're on sick leave.
F	ISABEL	Vacation.
M	HESS	Sorry I fell asleep.
F	ISABEL	We both did. I'm exhausted. Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel,
F	ISABEL	Hi, this isn't official business. Actually, I'm here on vacation. But I was sitting in a cafe this afternoon, near the Piazza Navona and...the police were chasing someone on foot. I was just wondering if you caught him or...do you know anything about that case? CONTINUED: 142
M	ITALIAN DETECTIVE	I know the case, yes. Unfortunately, we didn't catch him. ISABEL Oh... Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored ISABEL Excuse me... RUSTY Yes.
F	ISABEL	Um...Did I...? I think I saw you...yesterday. RUSTY Oh yeah? ISABEL The police were chasing you.
M	RUSTY	You sure your eyes aren't broken?
F	ISABEL	I'm quite sure it was you.
M	RUSTY	Well, then I'm not gonna argue. Can I buy you a coffee?
F	ISABEL	Hello.
M	RUSTY	We've got to stop meeting like this.
F	ISABEL	What are they talking about all the time?!
M	RUSTY	Soccer. He doesn't like Naples....thinks they're a bunch of...sissies. Can I ask you a question? Will you come to Zanzibar with me on Friday?
F	ISABEL	Stop it.
M	LIVINGSTON	We did it! It works! CONTINUED: 146
M	DANNY	What, what happened?
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	What's that?
F	ISABEL	An order signed by Commander Andriotti instructing you to "provide any and all support that Agent Lahiri requests, whenever she requests it."
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	It's good, yes. Okay.
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	That's a very nice blouse you wear today.
M	LINUS	When Dominique goes back with Thomas to check the trunk, the money shouldn't be in the briefcase. Franklin should have double-crossed them.
F	VIRGIL	That could be a great moment, when he's on the ground.
M	TURK	And you think Thomas is going to get blown up.
F	VIRGIL	Hey.
F	ISABEL	Another camera here and here. And have a guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be detected. All your IR devices need to be fitted with reflective faces otherwise a UV later can be used to burn the sensors out.
M	LINUS	She just walked in there like Patton or something. She's changing...everything and-- There were so many cops with her. I've never seen so-- CONTINUED: 152 I don't understand. If her father was a thief...why's she such a hardass? I mean you'd think she'd have a little sympathy for us.
M	RUSTY	When she was twelve her mother told her that her dad got arrested doing a job in Russia and died in jail. So I wouldn't count on much sympathy.
M	BASHER	"This time it's personal".
F	ISABEL	What do you want?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Ever heard of overkill?
F	ISABEL	I don't even think Toulour can get it now.
M	RUSTY	If he gets it, we'll let you arrest us. If we get it, you come away with me to Zanzibar--
F	ISABEL	What is your obsession with Zanzibar?!
M	RUSTY	Do you want to make the bet or not? CONTINUED: 153
F	ISABEL	I'm hanging up. Stop calling me.
M	LIVINGSTON	I'm telling you, with everything she's done in the last twenty-four hours...unless you happen to be best friends with the head of security at the museum, unless you are someone he knows and trusts enough to leave alone in the gallery, after disabling about half of their security system, forget it. We are not stealing that egg...
M	DANNY	"Someone he knows. Someone he trusts...." "Someone he knows...."
M	RUSTY	What about someone he doesn't know but trusts?
M	DANNY	For instance?
M	RUSTY	I'm talking about you know who, who looks an awful lot like you know who... CONTINUED: 156
M	DANNY	She might. It's not going to be easy getting her over here.
M	BRUISER	Hiya, Tess. Just climb on through. Try not to look down too much.
M	REUBEN	There's make-up in the bag there. And some photos. Do the best you can.
M	HOTEL MANAGER	Bonjourno. Yes. Yes. Oh...oh, really. Well, absolutely. We can have...I can make our presidential suite available. No, no, no. No trouble at all. We'd love... We're honored that she'd think of us...
M	HOTEL MANAGER (SUBTITLED)	Julia Roberts is coming to stay with us!
M	PRESS	Ms. Roberts! Ms. Roberts! Why did you come back to Rome so soon!!
F	TESS	I...uh...
M	PRESS	Was it to see Topher?
F	TESS	To see what?
M	PRESS	Topher Grace!! Your co-star!! Is that why you're here?!
F	TESS	Oh. No. I came to -- to see the-- CONTINUED: 163
M	PRESS	Where's Danny?
F	TESS	What?
M	PRESS	Danny, your husband!!
F	TESS	Well, he's not really--
M	REUBEN	Ms. Roberts is very tired!! Please let her through! Please!
F	TESS	I can't do this.
M	DANNY	Yes, you can.
F	TESS	I'm not an actress, Danny! And I don't look like her!
M	DANNY	You do, Tess. You really do. I never told you that before, but it's true.
F	TESS	Come on: my...
F	TESS	And my... And my ears. Anybody who sees my ears is going to know instantly.
M	DANNY	Nobody's looking at your ears.
F	TESS	Yes, Danny, they are. They're going to know.
F	ISABEL	When did that happen?
M	MUSEUM DIRECTOR	We just found out. I arranged a private showing for tomorrow morning before we open the show to the public.
F	ISABEL	I don't understand, why do you have to disable any of the systems--
M	MUSEUM DIRECTOR	Because she might want to get close to the egg, got right up here and look at it. And I'm not going to embarrass myself or this institution by telling her she can't.
F	ISABEL	She's an actress, Giovanni, not the Pope.
M	MUSEUM DIRECTOR	Do you realize how much free publicity we'll get for this museum, just because she because she decided to come by and look at the egg? She's even agreed to do a photo shoot for us promoting the museum. CONTINUED: 165
F	ISABEL	That's exactly the sort of thing...
M	ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.)	...that the people I'm after will exploit. Okay, fine. You want to shut down half the electronic system, let me post eight cops in the room...
M	MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)	Are you crazy? That's worse than....you want me to treat her like a criminal?
M	MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)	Look, if you need to do something to reinforce security during her visit, fine. But it's got to be out of sight. And it can't effect Julia in any way. Are we clear?
M	TURK	Where is he?
F	VIRGIL	There. I took a look at the interrogation scene.
M	TURK	Why?
F	VIRGIL	'Cause Linus said it was repetitive.
M	TURK	It clarifies everything.
F	VIRGIL	He said it's too on the nose.
M	TURK	What's he, the head of the studio? What's he ever written?
F	VIRGIL	He's just saying -- Oh, no--
M	TURK	What?
F	VIRGIL	It's not him!
M	TURK	What! How did you-- You moron! You said you were watching him the whole time! CONT1NUED: 168
F	VIRGIL	I was! I mean, I used the bathroom once, but it was quick. You lost him yesterday!
M	TURK	Livingston said Frank said that Rusty said that Danny said Toulour said don't ever bother following him. RUSTY I'm sorry. ISABEL What happened? I have to go. Right now. I have to leave the country. It could be a while. A month. Maybe more. Isabel turns to look at Rusty. She can barely see the
F	ISABEL	What are you saying? What the hell are you saying? Where are you going?
M	RUSTY	I can't tell you. Isabel stares at his dark face. ISABEL When people start talking the way you're talking there are only two possibilities: you're either in intelligence or you're a criminal. And no one I work with has ever worked with you...or even knows your name. RUSTY You knew what I was the day you met me, Isabel. ISABEL Robert... RUSTY We can talk about it when I get back.
F	ISABEL	No, Robert. I have to tell you something. RUSTY What is it?
F	ISABEL	I'm taking the job. I'm moving to Amsterdam. He doesn't respond for a moment.
M	RUSTY	I can't have this conversation right now. Please, Isabel. I have to get out of here. I love you. He kisses her then leaves.
F	ISABEL	You want to walk?
F	ISABEL	I know how you're planning to do it. I know Julia's visit is the key.
M	RUSTY	Who's Julia?
F	ISABEL	LeMarc knew when to get out. He just quit...with his perfect record intact. Now he's a legend. Don't do this.
M	RUSTY	LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old, Isabel. He was tired. His doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack. You're dramatizing it.
F	ISABEL	You don't know why LeMarc retired, any better than I do. You have no idea.
M	RUSTY	Actually, I do. I know exactly why.
F	ISABEL	Really? How's that? CONTINUED: 174
M	RUSTY	He told me.
F	ISABEL	You know LeMarc?
M	RUSTY	A little.
F	ISABEL	Since when?
M	RUSTY	Ten years ago.
F	ISABEL	For how long?
M	RUSTY	For six months.
F	ISABEL	You--
F	ISABEL	You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc and never told me? That's the worst thing you've ever done to me. Nobody knows more about LeMarc than me. How could you do that?
M	RUSTY	I couldn't tell you, then.
F	ISABEL	Really awful.
F	ISABEL	Then why aren't you as good as Toulour? CONTINUED: (2) 174
F	ISABEL	I don't want to arrest you, Robert. I really don't. But I will if you make me. I will if you go for that egg.
F	ISABEL	So many times, I waited. You can't do that to a person.
M	RUSTY	Isabel--
F	ISABEL	I have to go. He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the Rusty's whole body reacts.... He slowly looks around him, as
M	REUBEN	You're a photographer. Very exacting. You want things a certain way, but you never raise your voice. You're uncompromising. Strong.
M	FRANK	Reuben, what are you doing?
M	REUBEN	Oh, we understand each other. I'm mean, the actual words are gibberish to me, but I know what he means. There's a tone, you know. We communicate. I'm sure he'd tell you the same thing. Am I right?
M	TURK	I say we do a Joey Heatherton,
F	VIRGIL	It's the wrong color.
M	TURK	Damn. CONTINUED: 180
M	TOPHER	Hello?
M	TOPHER	Hey! I got your room number from McCormick, I hope you don't mind.
M	TOPHER	This is great. Do you have the adjoining room?
F	TESS	Uh, no.
M	TOPHER	Oh. Hey. I saw the rough cut of YOU ALWAYS, YOU NEVER. It's so awesome. Congratulations.
F	TESS	Oh. Thank you.
M	TOPHER	It was just like a dub of a lo-rez output, but I could totally see what you were doing. I think you might win again. Seriously.
F	TESS	Oh.
M	TOPHER	It really actually looked like you were blind. How did you do that? What is it like, an on-set thing, or was it digital?
F	TESS	It was, uh...
M	TOPHER	You can tell me, I won't tell a soul. Because if you say it's instinctual, I'm quitting right now. Seriously. The way you parted your hair? That was so connected. And that scene with the matches? And when you find out who your real grandmother is and run through the rain and find her on the porch and touch her face? Man, that was...you gotta tell Steven how much I loved it.
F	TESS	Okay.
M	TOPHER	So what are you doing?
F	TESS	I'm, uh, getting ready to go out...
M	TOPHER	I mean next. What movie are you doing next?
F	TESS	I...I'm having trouble deciding what to do next.
M	TOPHER	Is Danny working?
F	TESS	Danny...Danny is...Danny is...
M	TOPHER	Oh, no. Is something wrong? Have you two...
F	TESS	No, no...
M	TOPHER	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
F	TESS	No. we're absolutely fine, he's just--
M	TOPHER	I've got to stop asking people about their spouses, it's like always a mistake--
F	TESS	No, really--
M	TOPHER	Listen, I won't say a word. Seriously. I'm rooting for you guys, you know that. This is your private business and I totally respect that. No more Danny questions from me.
F	TESS	Thank you. He's fine. Danny's fine. He's working.
M	TOPHER	Hey, cool, whatever. That's what I'll say.
M	TOPHER	So can I come look at that Egg with you?
M	REUBEN	My name is Stuart Feldman, Worldwide Executive Senior Vice- President of Marketing, Corporate Senior Vice-President of Publicity and Corporate International Executive Worldwide President of Promotion for the Warner Brothers Motion Picture company. My colleague, Grant Wells, who is responsible for Ms. Roberts itinerary, has graciously set aside time for Ms. Roberts to view the Coronation Egg privately.
F	ISABEL	I want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down.
F	ISABEL	There! Right there!
F	TESS	It's so beautiful. My God.
M	TOPHER	Kinda small. CONTINUED: 185
M	TOPHER	Hi.
F	TESS	I'm not going to set off any alarms?
M	MUSEUM DIRECTOR	No. No. Get as close as you like.
M	REUBEN	Julia -- unless you have any objections -- Wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills. CONTINUED: 187
M	REUBEN	I was thinking maybe we could get you and Topher into some "You Always You Never" hats and t-shirts for the shoot--
F	TESS	That's stupid.
M	REUBEN	So stupid! Idiot. Maybe we could put some posters in the background--
F	TESS	I don't think we want to be so obvious--
M	REUBEN	I completely agree! Stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt.
F	ISABEL	This isn't going to work.
M	RUSTY	I don't know what you're talking about. CONTINUED: 189
M	JULIA	Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you so much.
M	TOPHER	Hey, J Ro, why the quick exit?
F	TESS	I...uh, I have to take some pills. Aspirin. I get headaches.
M	TOPHER	Yeah, well, with everything thing you've been going through I can see how you'd need something.
F	TESS	They're just aspirin.
M	TOPHER	Right. I've never taken aspirin in my life, ever. Can you believe that?
F	TESS	That's amazing.
M	TOPHER	For me, it's like a control thing.
F	TESS	Well, with aspirin...it's very beneficial.
M	TOPHER	Oh, yeah. I'm sure. CONTINUED: 190
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR	Who's in charge?
F	ISABEL	I am.
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	She is. CONTINUED: 193
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR	Oh, yeah... I'll start with him.
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR	When people think of Italy they think of food, wine, the Renaissance. They don't realize Italy has the scariest prisons in the civilized world. You know why? They're all leftover from the Middle Ages. They're worse than dirty; they're damp. They're like caves.
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR (cont'd)	I'm the only hope you've got.
M	LINUS	What do you want?
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR	Testify against the others in the Benedict case.
M	LINUS	I can't do that.
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR	Sure you can. You'll get a year, maybe two. The Italian charges will be dropped. You and the others will be extradited to the US this afternoon.
M	AGENT MOLLY STARR	Think about those prisons. Think about living there for twenty years, getting out when you're fifty. What a catch you'll be.
M	LINUS	Did you tell Dad?
M	CLINT	Of course she did. We're married, for God's sake.
F	TESS	Why didn't you tell me?
M	DANNY	I couldn't.
F	TESS	Why not?
M	DANNY	Because you're not an actress. You wouldn't have been so real. CONTINUED: 198
F	TESS	I thought you were going to jail.
M	DANNY	I'm not going to jail.
F	TESS	So you don't think I'm a good actress.
M	DANNY	You're a terrible liar.
F	TESS	I'm a good liar.
M	DANNY	Where did Benedict find you?
F	TESS	He...
M	DANNY	At your parent's house.
F	TESS	That was...okay, so I'm not a good liar. So what. You're good enough for both of us.
M	DANNY	Exactly.
F	ISABEL	What the-- Oh my God! Call the tower! Don't let that plane take off! Do something! Do you realize what's happening?! Do you understand what's going on?!
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	Yes, absolutely.
M	RUSTY	Guys. Get on there before they leave without you. Thanks.
M	CAPTAIN GIORDANO	Hey, no problem. Good seeing you, man.
M	ANDRIOTTI	Take care. See you back home.
M	RUSTY	Thanks, Scooter.
F	BUTLER	How was Rome, air?
F	TOULOUR	Put this in the safe, would you? CONTINUED: 200
F	BUTLER	Of course, sir. Your guests are on the veranda.
F	TOULOUR	Guests?
F	ISABEL	I hate you.
M	RUSTY	I love you.
F	ISABEL	This will ruin me.
M	RUSTY	No, it won't. Not if you come to Zanzibar.
F	ISABEL	What is it with Zanzibar?
M	RUSTY	It's where LeMarc is.
M	RUSTY	That one's ours. We can be there in three hours.
M	RUSTY	Don't you want to meet him? He wants to meet you.
F	ISABEL	You're asking me to turn my back on my whole life. CONTINUED: 201 Would you miss it?
F	ISABEL	I'm a cop. That's who I am.
M	RUSTY	You're only a cop because your father was a thief.
F	ISABEL	Who died in a Russian jail.
M	RUSTY	According to you mother.
F	ISABEL	What does that mean?
M	RUSTY	It means you should meet LeMarc.
F	TOULOUR	Let me guess, you decided you did want to give my lawyer a call. But you lost his card.
M	DANNY	No, nothing like that. We just came to collect our money.
F	TOULOUR	Not only did you fail, half of your crew got pinched! Your plan was not good. And you don't look anything like Julia Roberts! I mean your... ...and your... ...and your ears. CONTINUED: 202
F	TOULOUR	Oh, no. You stole it on the way to Rome didn't you? I stole a replica. CONTINUED: 206
M	LINUS	He's completely drunk. The BackPack Kid nods his head. Linus goes back to his book.
M	DANNY	What happened?
M	LINUS	We thought someone was following us.
F	TOULOUR	But that means you knew what to steal before LeMarc proposed that I challenge you for it. That means...
M	RUSTY	Gaspar, it's Rusty. How are you?
M	DANNY	I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE!
M	RUSTY	FINE, THEN STAY HERE!
F	TOULOUR	LeMarc told you. Of course.
F	TOULOUR	To teach me. CONTINUED: 211
M	DANNY	Well, we'll be in touch to make all the arrangements.
F	TOULOUR	No. Don't go. Please.
F	TOULOUR	You are my guests. I will celebrate your victory. Besides, you may have noticed, I don't like to be alone.
F	TOULOUR	I am feeling more French by the minute. To my first depression.
M	BASHER	So I think if you really analyze it, you can see that it's inevitable. It's time for us to evolve, en masse. I have to help bring that about whatever way I can, you know. Otherwise, the trajectory is fixed. You know what I'm saying?
F	SAUL	Mmm. Yes. But I'm through evolving, I think. It's too tiring. I feel pretty evolved. You know, considering.
M	TURK	I've got an idea for another Dominique story.
F	VIRGIL	Can we finish this one first?
M	TURK	Just let me tell it to you.
F	VIRGIL	No.
M	TURK	It's like three sentences.
F	VIRGIL	I'm serious; you're asking too much.
M	REUBEN	May I look at that when you're through with it?
M	LIVINGSTON	All in all, it was depressingly familiar. The forced camaraderie, the hollow smiles. Scared to take a moment's reflection. Scared to imagine a different life. We behaved like boys. But... CONTINUED: 215
M	LIVINGSTON	I'm Livingston Dell. Thanks for listening.
F	TESS	When do you want to go back?
M	DANNY	Feel like traveling?
F	TESS	Yeah. Don't you?
M	DANNY	Yeah.
F	TOULOUR	Tess. Danny. This is Monica Bellucci.
M	MONICA	Hello.
M	TESS & DANNY	Hello.
F	TOULOUR	We're thinking of taking a trip to the states. Take a look around. We'd love to meet some of your friends while we're there. Actually, one friend in particular.
M	RUSTY	There he is.
M	RUSTY (cont'd)	Gaspar!
F	ISABEL	Gaspar? That was my fa--
M	ISABEL (cont'd)	Daddy.
M	REUBEN	That's the exact figure, I'm pretty sure.
M	BENEDICT	Yes.
M	REUBEN	So we're clean?
M	BENEDICT	You want it in writing?
M	REUBEN	I'll take your word.
M	BENEDICT	You're clean.
M	REUBEN	These grudges, they're awful. Nobody wine.
M	BENEDICT	As soon as someone retaliates, the situation is out of control. CONTINUED: 224 This way, there's no need for retaliation. Why would there be?
M	BENEDICT	There's plenty for everyone.
M	REUBEN	More than plenty. It's just a matter of sharing.
M	BENEDICT	Sharing is good.
M	REUBEN	It is. Waiter? Can I get sparkling water? It's good for my acid reflux.
M	WAITER	Of course.
