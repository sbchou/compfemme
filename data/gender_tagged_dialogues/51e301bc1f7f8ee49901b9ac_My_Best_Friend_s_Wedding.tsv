M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	by Ronald Bass	First Draft Screenplay reservation at least an hour overdue. Tourists can't even make the
M	CAPTAIN	A variation on our squid ink risotto. Trace of Moselle, to sweeten the stock.
M	CAPTAIN	Don't kill us on this one, it's a long shot.
F	JULIANNE	I'm writing it up as inventive and confident. Which it is. Off the record, I'll need an extra boat of the ink. Or a salt shaker.
M	CAPTAIN	I'll toss a coin.
M	DIGGER	Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
F	JULIANNE	If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
F	JULIANNE	Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
M	DIGGER	I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
F	JULIANNE	See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in. It's who I leave out.
M	DIGGER	Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
F	JULIANNE	Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
M	DIGGER	This fellow from Newsday ever call?
F	JULIANNE	I'll buzz my machine. Inventive and confident, yeh?
M	DIGGER	Needs salt.
F	JULIANNE	Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
M	DIGGER	... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
F	JULIANNE	Sometimes I do. Like for two months.
M	DIGGER	... weeks. Hey. It's Michael.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	God, it must be, what, months, huh? I can't wait to talk to you. I'm in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	Call me four in the morning, whatever, we gotta talk.
M	DIGGER	Who called? The man of the moment?
F	JULIANNE	No, no, the opposite. That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
M	DIGGER	The wandering sportswriter.
M	DIGGER	I didn't know you two had a past.
M	DIGGER	The look in your eye.
F	JULIANNE	Sophomore year at Yale we had this one hot month. And, you know me, I got restless...
F	JULIANNE	So I get up the nerve to break his heart. I tell him there's this dreamy exchange student from Pakistan who wants to, you know...
F	JULIANNE	And he gets this... look. He says, "I knew I couldn't hold your interest", which, of course, makes me feel like the shallow bitch I've always been...
F	JULIANNE	Then he says, "But what makes me want to cry. Is I'm losing the best friend I ever had."
F	JULIANNE	And when he said it, I knew. I felt the same.
F	JULIANNE	So I cried. For maybe the third time in my life. And I kissed him. And we've been best friends ever since.
F	JULIANNE	Nine years, we've seen each other through everything. Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times. The best times of my life, maybe. Just drinking and talking. Even over a phone.
M	DIGGER	Kindred spirits.
F	JULIANNE	No, he's nothing like me. He's like you. Only straight.
F	JULIANNE	He's the salt of the earth. Kind and loyal and generous. The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
M	DIGGER	He's still in love with you.
F	JULIANNE	Maybe. But it never gets in the way.
M	DIGGER	Well, he has a true friend in you.
M	DIGGER	Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
F	JULIANNE	Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
F	JULIANNE	There was this one night in Tucson, like six years ago... we got amazingly drunk, I mean, Keith Richards time...
F	JULIANNE	God, I haven't thought of this in so long...
F	JULIANNE	I can even believe we did this...
F	JULIANNE	Could you give us a minute?
F	JULIANNE	You won't miss much, I promise there was no sex.
M	DIGGER	I've lost interest.
F	JULIANNE	He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
M	DIGGER	Blood oath.
F	JULIANNE	He says, "Swear. When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
F	JULIANNE	See, he figured that would be a sign from God, or someone of comparable authority, that we'd misunderstood our destinies.
F	JULIANNE	We never talked about it again. I don't know what made me think of... I do.
M	DIGGER	You'll be 28 in three weeks. How old is he?
F	JULIANNE	You think...
M	DIGGER	Desperate. To talk.
F	JULIANNE	He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
M	DIGGER	Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
F	JULIANNE	He can't do that to me!
M	DIGGER	We're about to find out.
F	JULIANNE	When I turn him down...
F	JULIANNE	We'll never be the same.
M	DIGGER	I have a suggestion...
F	JULIANNE	I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
M	DIGGER (sadly)	That was it.
F	JULIANNE	This is awkward timing, Michael, I just joined this convent, and they never give your deposit ba...
F	JULIANNE	Michael, I'm married.
F	JULIANNE	... and I have two weeks to live.
F	JULIANNE	Michael, I'm trying to be gay, don't confuse me.
F	JULIANNE	I was calling Michael O'Neal, but seeing it's so late, I could just leave a mes... Good evening, sir. You've been enrolled in the Obscene Call Of The Month Club, and th...
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	Hey! God, it's so good to hear your voice.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	I've been calling for days!
F	JULIANNE	Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages. I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally... Look, I have to ask you something.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	Something so incredibly important, that if you turn me down, I don't know what I'll d...
M	JULIANNE (bright)	I just have to tell you this one thing first, okay? I mean this will hand you the biggest laugh of your adult life...
F	JULIANNE	I was thinking about you, and I remembered this unbelievably insane night we spent together in Tucson, like a thousand years ago?
F	JULIANNE	I mean, there's no way you could possibly remember the... Are you kidding?
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	I think about that night all the time.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	But it's not why I called.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	I called because I met someone.
F	JULIANNE	Well, that's great. You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee... You don't understand. I've never felt this way about anybody!
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	And she's all wrong for me!
F	JULIANNE	Well, somet...
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	And her dad is like this billionaire who owns the White Sox and some cable empire, and you know how I've always been miserably awkward around those kinda stuffed suits...
F	JULIANNE	Well, sure. But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
F	JULIANNE	You've met her parents. Well. Sure. See. We're getting married. This Sunday.
F	JULIANNE	Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su... Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such. Aren't you... working this weekend? I mean, is that responsible?
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	Well, the Sox are at home. SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt. That's Frank...
F	JULIANNE	... Thomas, yeh.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	Jules. I'm scared.
F	JULIANNE	Well, maybe we should talk ab... I need you.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	If you can't come. And hold my hand. I'll never get through this.
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	Please come, please.
F	JULIANNE	W...
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	I can't wait for you to meet her! You've reached Digger and George. Brevity will be appreciated. IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS UP HAVING SAFE SEX??
F	JULIANNE	OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER THE PHONE??
F	JULIANNE	YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU, ISN'T IT??
M	DIGGER	You can't get lung cancer and die in four days. Go to Plan B.
F	JULIANNE	You have no appropriate sense of emergency. My best friend is ruining his life.
M	DIGGER	No, he's ruining yours.
F	JULIANNE	Same difference. If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
M	DIGGER	You have a real philosophy of life.
F	JULIANNE	It's called the Law of Love, asshole. Why don't we have a drink? You could catch a later fl...
F	JULIANNE	I'm a busy girl. I've got four days to break up a wedding, and steal the bride's fella.
F	JULIANNE	He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
M	DIGGER	I can see why.
F	JULIANNE	She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
F	JULIANNE	And don't go feeling sorry for me, you don't know me that well. We're only friends. I stand corrected.
F	JULIANNE	I'm making a big mistake, huh?
M	DIGGER (shrugs)	Maybe you'll learn something.
F	JULIANNE	I'm gonna bring him back, man. Against all odds, y'know. Cos if I don't...
F	JULIANNE	... I gotta live with it forever.
F	JULIANNE	And at my wedding. I'll be the only bride with her own best man.
M	MICHAEL (murmurs)	Can you believe it? Can you believe I'm actually gonna do this? Not hardly.
F	KIMMY	This just makes everything so perfect.
F	KIMMY	All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
F	JULIANNE	Well, we're...
F	KIMMY	I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
F	KIMMY	I've never had a sister.
F	KIMMY	My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
F	JULIANNE	You need a few dollars.
F	KIMMY	Dry. Just like he said.
F	JULIANNE	Excuse me?
F	KIMMY	I can be quick. I can even be funny.
F	KIMMY	But I can't be dry.
F	JULIANNE	Can you watch the road?
F	KIMMY	See. Dry. It's in the delivery.
F	KIMMY	This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
F	JULIANNE	... you want a menage on your wedding night. No, that wouldn't be burdensome.
F	KIMMY	My classmate Angelique shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abeline on Spring Break.
F	KIMMY	Be my maid of honor.
F	KIMMY	You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
F	JULIANNE	Uh. How about promoting a bridesmaid? Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
F	KIMMY	The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts. With amazing bodies!
F	JULIANNE	Which was the disqualifying factor?
F	KIMMY	The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
F	KIMMY	This means I have four days to make you my new best friend...
F	KIMMY	And since I already know everything about you. Including intimate facts I'm mortified to have heard, but too envious to forget. It's time for you to learn about me...
F	KIMMY	Force yourself. To get personal. Sounds like a plan.
F	KIMMY	If you'd rather the lilac...
F	JULIANNE	I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
F	KIMMY	Not you. You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
F	JULIANNE	What else did he tell you...
F	KIMMY	... you hate weddings, you never go.
F	KIMMY	You're not up for anything conventional, or popularly assumed to be female priorities. Including marriage. Or romance. Or even...
M	JULIANNE (quietly)	... not even love.
F	JULIANNE	That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit. Right from the start.
F	KIMMY	He said that, too.
F	KIMMY	Well, I thought I was like you. And proud to be. Until I met rumpled, smelly old Michael...
F	KIMMY	And then I found I was just a sentimental schmuck. Like all those flighty nitwits I'd always pitied.
F	KIMMY	Funny world, huh?
F	JULIANNE	I need a smoke.
F	KIMMY	It's mostly the seam. Let's get this to Carlos. Just. Don't. Move.
F	JULIANNE	Don't you have to be somewh...
F	KIMMY	... just my bridal shower. And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
F	KIMMY	Other than that...
F	JULIANNE	Come in, and shut the...
F	JULIANNE	... door. Should I turn around, or someth...
F	JULIANNE	Michael, I'm in my underwear!
M	MICHAEL	We've seen each other a lot more naked than this.
M	MICHAEL	I mean, we were skinny-dipping in Greece, just as pals, less than two years ago.
F	JULIANNE	Things are different now.
M	MICHAEL (softly)	Well. I leave with two thoughts in my mind.
M	MICHAEL (even softer)	You're still a very pretty girl.
F	JULIANNE	What's the sec...
M	MICHAEL	Mirrors.
F	JULIANNE	... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
F	KIMMY	What? Because I'm a little understand...
F	JULIANNE	... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding. Just to top it off.
F	KIMMY	I can't expect the NBA to hold up the playoffs...
F	KIMMY	I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
F	JULIANNE	So your honeymoon is exactly where?
F	KIMMY	It depends. If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix. Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
F	JULIANNE	... garden sports, all. Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
F	KIMMY	It's his career, I'm supportive. Look, I've been everywhere, I've seen the world, I've laid on a beach. I want to be with the man I love. That's what makes it a honeymoon.
F	JULIANNE	I'm just saying he's lucky.
F	JULIANNE	Takes one woman in a billion to put up with his array of shit. The guy is a one-man festival of idiosync...
F	JULIANNE	Well. You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
F	KIMMY	... his snoring, yeah. He says it's worse than ever. That snaffle one...?
F	KIMMY	Well now it has this sorta phlegm rattle behind it...
F	KIMMY	Guess what? Earplugs work.
F	JULIANNE	How about...
F	KIMMY	... cigars in bed? I broke him on that. But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
F	KIMMY	... loves action movies, subscribes to Playboy for godsake, reads over my shoulder, can't keep track of the checks he writes...
F	KIMMY	He sucks soup through his front teeth.
F	JULIANNE	A trademark move, don't touch it.
F	KIMMY	But he sure can kiss.
F	JULIANNE	It's been awhile. I'll take your word.
F	KIMMY	After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
F	KIMMY	I threw the list away.
F	KIMMY	He's not a balance sheet, so many wonderful qualities, so many faults. He's Michael.
F	KIMMY	And loving him means loving all of this.
F	JULIANNE	Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
F	KIMMY	So it's sweet of you to be protective...
F	JULIANNE	Let me rephrase that...
F	KIMMY	But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
F	JULIANNE	Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
F	KIMMY	... except one.
F	JULIANNE	Oh, yeah?
F	KIMMY	You.
F	KIMMY	You'll always be there. In his mind. The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
F	JULIANNE	Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
F	KIMMY	I'm not joking. I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
F	JULIANNE	No.
F	KIMMY	And the answer was so simple.
F	JULIANNE	I was gonna predict that.
F	KIMMY	You win.
F	KIMMY	You're enshrined in his heart and memory. Unassailable. Which works out great.
F	JULIANNE	I've missed a step.
F	KIMMY	He has you on a pedestal. And me in his arms.
F	JULIANNE	Jesus, we're trapped!
F	KIMMY	Ju...
F	JULIANNE	No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
F	JULIANNE	There's a panel up there, you could boost me...
F	JULIANNE	You know how little air is in these things? I've seen statistics! Once you're trapped between floors...
F	JULIANNE	God! Then the door is jammed!
F	MANDY	Mah Gawd, it's the bride, and the woman she'll nevah live up to! That would be us.
M	SAMMY	Did she say th' wrong thang agin? It is so in character!
F	JULIANNE	I'm Julianne Potter, and...
M	SAMMY	... we'd be the vengeful sluts. We came in complementary colors.
F	MANDY	Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules? As M. of H., you get first fuck. Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
F	JULIANNE	... unless he has a hump. Dry. I told you.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)	Is this Michael's Julianne?
F	ISABELLE	I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice, girl.
F	ISABELLE	Now, my husband says to scoot you over to the ballpark, so you can hang with Michael. But first, you have to meet a lot of really old women.
F	ISABELLE	That is, if you've absorbed enough profanity. We sayed one fuck.
F	JULIANNE	Desperate measures! Do you hear me? Digger, are you the...
F	JULIANNE	I don't know, hit men, whoopee cushions, saltpeter, something! The girl is impossibly impregnable. Even I want her to get the guy!!
F	JULIANNE	Tell him the what? The truth...??
F	JULIANNE	That desperate. May I never get.
F	JULIANNE	Which of you gents ordered two beers?
M	MICHAEL	Wow! Lemme give you a ha... Michael. You'll unwittingly imply that I'm clumsy.
M	MICHAEL	Think of that. And as well as I know you.
M	BODYGUARD	Sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty. It's Miss. And thanks. That leaves two for me.
M	MICHAEL	Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Gerry from SI, and you know Daniel...
M	MICHAEL	Oh. This is my father-in-law, Walter.
M	MICHAEL	How are you doing this? You're on drugs.
F	WALTER	If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
F	JULIANNE	I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
F	WALTER	Under the circumstances. Charmed to know you, Jules.
F	JULIANNE	Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
M	MICHAEL	And, this guy, you know...
F	JULIANNE	Papa Joe.
M	JOE	You gonna be my boy's best man?
F	JULIANNE	Best everything, Joe. But I'm going to dance with you.
M	MICHAEL	Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance??
F	JULIANNE	Moves. You've never seen.
M	MICHAEL	You're an impostor! What have you done with my best friend?
M	MICHAEL	And how was the hot dog?
M	MICHAEL	Cheap and unnecessary. We were looking anyway.
F	JULIANNE	I just admire your maturity, that's all. I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring. Day after day, year after year...
M	MICHAEL	... see, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
M	MICHAEL	Luckily. The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus. Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
F	JULIANNE	Such as.
M	MICHAEL	She's too genuine.
F	JULIANNE	Hate that.
M	MICHAEL	How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
F	JULIANNE	What's next?
M	MICHAEL	No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
F	JULIANNE	Endearingly absent-minded.
M	MICHAEL	My very point. Here's another one...
M	MICHAEL	Every day. She makes the bed.
F	JULIANNE	Quite the little eccentric.
M	MICHAEL	At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
F	JULIANNE	Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
M	MICHAEL	She admires. Tommy Lasorda.
F	JULIANNE	Waiter! Check, please!
M	MICHAEL	She finds him "personable."
F	JULIANNE	Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
M	MICHAEL	Then again. She has a few good traits.
F	JULIANNE	Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
M	MICHAEL	First girl I ever knew. Who lets me give her a bath.
M	MICHAEL	And when I hug her, even in public. I don't have to let go right away. She lets me hold her as long as I want.
M	MICHAEL	Nice kid, don't you think?
F	JULIANNE	Looks like, from here.
F	JULIANNE	How'd you find this pl...
F	KIMMY	Lived here my whole life, never heard of it. Until our first date.
F	KIMMY	He finds all these spots, everywhere he goes, it's a mystical gift. Jesus, one d-back from the Bears knows a place...
F	KIMMY	It's not just clubs. This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
F	JULIANNE	... always. The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
F	KIMMY	Stop, we're embarrassing h...
F	JULIANNE	... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
M	MICHAEL	I tried those on. When you weren't looking.
F	JULIANNE	Where was that, Florence, huh?
M	MICHAEL	Firenze.
F	JULIANNE	The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
M	MICHAEL	Till the gas ran out.
F	KIMMY	I love Florence.
F	JULIANNE	Take her there.
F	JULIANNE	I mean, now. She's perky, she deserves a honeymoon.
F	JULIANNE	I heard. If San Antone sweeps Sacramento. What is this shit? You gotta get off the road by September anyway, when does Fall Quarter start?
F	KIMMY	Uh. I'm not coming back. For senior year.
F	JULIANNE	Don't architects find a degree, sort of... an asset?
F	KIMMY	Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
M	MICHAEL	I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
F	KIMMY	The most important thing. Is being together.
F	KIMMY	I'm just a baby. I've got all... the time... in the world.
M	MICHAEL	Because I could come...
F	KIMMY	To the twins' soiree? So they can paw you and drool...? They're gonna drool anyway! Enjoy each other.
F	JULIANNE	Should I whistle down a cab?
M	MICHAEL	Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember?
F	JULIANNE	Sometimes. About the dumbest things.
M	MICHAEL	The El's right down the street. Unless you're afraid of the neighborhood.
F	JULIANNE	No. I'm always safe with you.
F	JULIANNE	Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
M	MICHAEL	What, leaving school...
F	JULIANNE	... all of it. She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows. She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers... In her way.
F	JULIANNE	All to follow you in this dumb job, where you travel 52 weeks a year to College Station, Texas, and such. It's not a job for a grown man, Michael, Peter Pan never married. I don't think she's naturally the... submissive type. Aren't you afraid she's gonna choke on this stand-by-your-man shit after awhi... No.
F	JULIANNE	I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
M	MICHAEL	She would never. Never. Even think of that.
F	JULIANNE	I guess you're right. That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
M	MICHAEL	I got the point.
F	JULIANNE	Still. All's fair in love and w...
M	MICHAEL	That would be a girl. I don't even know. Forgive me, okay? I was talkin' crazy.
M	JULIANNE (O.S.)	It's Albanian, I think. Or Mongolian. Or Canadian. One of those. I bought it downstairs...
M	JULIANNE (O.S.)	I figure, what the hell. Can it make me look worse?
F	JULIANNE	Dig, of course. Of course, of course, of course, of course I have a plan. Certainment!
F	JULIANNE	How? I ask myself, what would Lucy Ricardo do in this situa...
F	JULIANNE	Well, one worked, once.
F	JULIANNE	Ricky wouldn't let her in the show.
F	JULIANNE	I recall it differently, but we digress.
F	JULIANNE	So in the version, you're Ethel, with better fashion instincts.
F	JULIANNE	This puts you in charge of Plan B, the unprincipled and insanely dangerous back-up plan...
F	JULIANNE	In case simple lying doesn't work.
F	JULIANNE	Question. What happens if you brush your teeth with shampoo?
F	JULIANNE	HOLD ON. I'M COMING IN FOR YOU!
F	JULIANNE	You okay? This is one of those problem phones.
F	JULIANNE	Right. Your role. You know guys from Sports Illustrated, yes? I mean, you can walk right in there...
F	JULIANNE	You could get access to letterhead, for example. ... or even, maybe, their fax.
F	JULIANNE	It's an homage thing.
F	JULIANNE	Awkward girls grow up on Audrey Hepburn movies. You wouldn't understand.
F	KIMMY	Anyway, I think you're wrong.
F	KIMMY	What you were saying before.
F	KIMMY	About Michael's job.
F	JULIANNE	Oh, that. I forgot I even said th...
F	KIMMY	I just think you're wrong, is all.
F	JULIANNE	Probably am. Forget I brought it up.
F	KIMMY	I mean, he loves his job.
F	JULIANNE	Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
F	JULIANNE	What's not to love?
F	KIMMY	But he always says...
F	JULIANNE	... whatever is manly and independent.
F	JULIANNE	Why would he trade that for running, say, a big piece of the PR at a powerful, complex, challenging conglomerate like your dad's?
F	KIMMY	That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed.
F	JULIANNE	I'm not stupid. Say, how about this?
F	KIMMY	For the twins? What in the world is th...
F	JULIANNE	Gold nose hair clippers.
F	KIMMY	So you don't think Michael's as happy with his job as...
F	KIMMY	Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
F	JULIANNE	Hello.
F	KIMMY	You think he'd accept?
F	KIMMY	Michael. A job like that.
F	JULIANNE	By any yardstick that involves sanity, it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him. Present company excepted.
F	JULIANNE	On the other hand, he's proud. Last thing a man wants to admit, is being trapped in a dispiriting dead-end job that can never support a family.
F	JULIANNE	Throw a man a life preserver. He'll say, "Thanks, anyway, I'd rather drown."
F	KIMMY	So... one almost has to...
F	JULIANNE	Exactly.
F	KIMMY	Exactly what?
F	JULIANNE	What you said. Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
F	JULIANNE	I couldn't really... do that. After, you know... ... lying. All the time.
F	JULIANNE	Oh, darling, my pitiful desires and ambitions are dirt beneath the manly boots of your priorities! Two hundred seedy motels a year? Dinners out of vending machines? Waiting for you in vermin-infested corridors of dark crotch-rot locker rooms? This stuff makes me hot!!
F	KIMMY	The very words I've used.
F	JULIANNE	We make Dad your co-conspirator. Michael does a favor for Walter.
F	JULIANNE	Walter's reorganizing his public relations, needs a brilliant guy who's close to him, who he can completely trust.
F	JULIANNE	So you beg. Michael, please do this for Daddy, please, please, please, blah, blah, blah... it's only for six months... it would mean so much to me to help him out...
F	KIMMY	He'll see right through it.
F	JULIANNE	Only. If he wants to.
F	JULIANNE	In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
F	KIMMY	He won't get mad, huh?
M	MR. MOONEY (O.S.)	May I be of any help, whatsoever?
F	JULIANNE	Bridesmaid gifts for two, well, assertive, outspoken, Tennessee debutantes. He won't be mad? Nothing here seems to quite capture their distinctive personalities.
M	MR. MOONEY	Something customized, perhaps? We can fashion most any item from gold.
M	MR. MOONEY	An object that might represent what is closest. To their heart. Don't even think dildo.
F	JULIANNE	Could you do this...
F	JULIANNE	In 24 carat?
M	KIMMY (softly)	Bingo.
F	KIMMY	You don't think he'll be mad.
F	JULIANNE	Your call. You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns. Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
F	KIMMY	I just don't want to freak him out.
F	JULIANNE	How mad could he get?
M	MAITRE D'	Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests have retired to the humidor.
M	MAITRE D'	Oh. Mademoiselle.
M	MAITRE D'	It's unofficial, of course. But, traditionally, the humidor is for gentlemen, only...
F	JULIANNE	Great. I've got this girlfriend at the Justice Department? With all this time on her hands? Piece of cake. I'll hang, and think happy thoughts...
M	GUY	Know what you're looking for, little lady?
F	JULIANNE	Yeah. Do you?
M	GUY	I asked first.
F	JULIANNE	I like 'em long and hard. Kind of... big around.
F	JULIANNE	Smell is important, I'm a believer in that.
F	JULIANNE	But you never know what you've got. Till you run your tongue over it.
M	GUY	I meant. What you're looking for in a man.
F	JULIANNE	Actually, I'm partial to married gentlemen.
M	GUY	Why is that?
F	JULIANNE	It's so much time. When I phone the wives.
F	WALTER	Your idea?
F	WALTER	You're a woman of insight.
F	WALTER	My wife and I love this marriage, and deplore its circumstances.
F	WALTER	As you guessed, my daughter is unhappy about giving up her life. And, in my opinion, cowardly in avoiding the necessary confrontation.
F	WALTER	Mike has a world of ability. I'd do anything to have him in my company.
F	WALTER	Except ask him.
F	WALTER	He'd resent it. And me. And, most important, Kim.
F	WALTER	He's a great kid, but he's still a kid. Instead of recognizing that his resistance comes from insecurity, he'd turn it to anger. To protect himself...
F	WALTER	... from realizing that he's ignoring my daughter's needs, despite how very much he loves her.
F	WALTER	They both have some growing up to do. But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
F	JULIANNE	I think you're making a mistake, sir.
F	WALTER	And that interests me. How someone who knows him so well could be so wrong.
F	JULIANNE	See, I love him, too, as much as anyone here. And for a whole lot longer.
F	JULIANNE	I think I know best what would make him happy.
F	JULIANNE	Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear you, all right?
F	JULIANNE	It is stupid, dishonest, desperate beyond belief, and can't possibly ever work. It can only end in humiliation and disgrace. Now can I say two words?
F	JULIANNE	Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
F	JULIANNE	All right, twelve words.
M	TEENAGER	You do it, girl.
M	MICHAEL	Wow. What was going on in there?
F	JULIANNE	Some crazy person.
M	MICHAEL	You're not eating.
F	JULIANNE	I never eat when I'm serene.
M	MICHAEL	You never eat when you're despondent.
F	JULIANNE	I switched that around when you weren't looking.
M	MICHAEL	Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah? Sure. The rhinos were fucking.
F	JULIANNE	Boy, those were the days.
M	MICHAEL	Yeah, they were.
F	JULIANNE	That was nice. The way you said that.
M	MICHAEL	It's weird being the groom. All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
F	JULIANNE	You need a baby-sitter. That's what I'm here for.
F	JULIANNE	Say it.
M	MICHAEL	Now, there's my girl.
F	JULIANNE	See, I can only do it with beer.
M	MICHAEL	See, better already.
M	MICHAEL	We'll go back to the bathroom, you'll put this on...
F	JULIANNE	Bet you're glad I'm here to take care of you.
M	MICHAEL	Bet I am.
M	MICHAEL	Hope that crazy person's not still there. She doesn't scare me.
F	JULIANNE	Is anybody watching?
F	WALTER	I hope so. This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
F	JULIANNE	I picked up Michael's messages for him, at our hotel. I stole one...
F	WALTER	Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
F	JULIANNE	Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
F	WALTER	Matter of fact, that's how I got married.
F	JULIANNE	It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
F	WALTER	I know Ben.
F	JULIANNE	"Mike. We still have no answer to our E-mail of Wednesday. Which option do you select? I don't mean to rush you, but Personnel needs to tie up the loose ends."
F	JULIANNE	I think he's been fired.
F	WALTER	It doesn't say th...
F	JULIANNE	He's said some things over the past few weeks. Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
F	JULIANNE	And why I couldn't say anything before in front of Kim.
F	JULIANNE	I just think of how... desperate he must be feeling. He's marrying a rich man's daughter, and he's about to become destitute. You know the kind of job market he'll be facing?
F	WALTER	And you think he's kept this to himself.
F	JULIANNE	He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
F	JULIANNE	If you do it now, it's like he's helping you. He can accept with dignity.
F	WALTER	This fax could mean... any number of things...
F	WALTER	Maybe. I should call Ben.
F	JULIANNE	Then it could all come out, sooner or later. Nobody should be in on this. Just you and me. Or, more correctly, I.
F	JULIANNE	What if, what if I could find that E-mail?
F	JULIANNE	I never noticed. Kimmy has your eyes.
F	JULIANNE	Hello, again.
F	JULIANNE	You still haven't straightened that tie.
F	JULIANNE	You know, my friend, the one whose message I picked up... ?
F	JULIANNE	Well, he's still with the wedding party. And he asked me to get something he needs real badly from his room... ?
F	JULIANNE	He's in 1526. If you could just let me ha...
M	BOY	See that woman?
M	BOY	She said, if I ever pull a stunt like that again...
F	JULIANNE	You'll lose your job... ... tear my pecker off. Is what she said.
F	JULIANNE	Help me!
F	JULIANNE	I locked myself out, 1526, please hurry!!
F	JULIANNE	Uno-cinco-does-ses.
F	JULIANNE	You wouldn't change your password, would you? You never change anything.
F	JULIANNE	Shoeless... Joe.
F	JULIANNE	Mike. I hate this downsizing shit as much as you do. But I know this can't become as a complete surprise...
F	WALTER	Mike. I hate this downsizing...
F	WALTER	And Kimmy doesn't know.
F	WALTER	I'll tell her I've reconsidered.
F	WALTER	You're a smart girl, Jules.
F	WALTER	Wish my daughter. Bad your guts.
M	MICHAEL	Sure you're okay?
M	MICHAEL	It's not just a gag, huh?
F	KIMMY	No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
M	MICHAEL	I wish you'd just... come out with it. I mean why are we waiting for Jules?
F	KIMMY	Moral support.
F	KIMMY	What's good of having a big sister, if she...
M	MICHAEL	Wow and wow. You have a date, after this?
F	JULIANNE	Never can tell.
M	MICHAEL	You make me think of that song, we used to...
M	MICHAEL	Someday. When I'm awfully low...
M	MICHAEL	Okay, kid. You're on.
F	KIMMY	It's really my father. Who needs the favor.
F	KIMMY	He's... he's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company...
M	MICHAEL	He never mentioned that. Neither did y...
F	KIMMY	... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
F	KIMMY	He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
M	MICHAEL	Like family, huh?
F	KIMMY	It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
M	MICHAEL	To him.
F	KIMMY	And to m...
M	MICHAEL	... and you knew about this.
F	JULIANNE	I think you ought to listen to her, Michael. This is her life, too.
M	MICHAEL	Well, which is it?
M	MICHAEL	You gonna tell me Daddy thought this one up? All of a sudden, I'm the only jerk alive who can help him deal with the press?
M	MICHAEL	Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
F	JULIANNE	Michael!!
F	KIMMY	I am honest!
F	KIMMY	All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
M	MICHAEL	Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
M	MICHAEL	I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
F	KIMMY	What is that sup...
M	MICHAEL	And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love. How inconvenient.
M	MICHAEL	No problem. A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
F	JULIANNE	Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
M	MICHAEL	Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
M	MICHAEL	I'll tell you why. Because that isn't you. And it isn't me, either! We're the same person!
M	MICHAEL	What a sweet little picture. Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
F	KIMMY	Well, if that's the way you f...
M	MICHAEL	Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
M	MICHAEL	Great! Tears! The big equalizer. You wait till two days before the wedding to drop this on me, and I'm just supposed to roll over and drool!
M	MICHAEL	Fine. I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
F	KIMMY	MICHAEL!!
F	KIMMY	Michael, you are so...
F	KIMMY	... so right. And I am so very wrong.
F	KIMMY	We can't go down two roads. And still be together.
F	JULIANNE	Uh, Kimmy...?
F	KIMMY	We settled this. And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
F	KIMMY	You have to forgive me, and forget this ever happened...
F	KIMMY	... or I'll die.
F	JULIANNE	... see that's what I never counted on! I never heard of a brilliant moron before!
F	JULIANNE	I mean, the little twerp GROVELED!!
F	JULIANNE	SHE IS SO WRONG FOR HIM!
F	JULIANNE	Michael and I are the same person! Self-absorbed and imperfect and vaguely loveable! We deserve each other!
F	JULIANNE	I'm out of hope, I'm out of sneaky ideas, I'm at the end of my rapidly-fraying hysterical little rope! Help m...
M	JULIANNE (O.S.)	God, I hate this hotel.
M	JULIANNE (O.S.)	And I hate talking to your machine!
M	DIGGER	You stole my line.
F	JULIANNE	Oh, shit!
M	DIGGER	Chill. We don't want your face coming off with it.
F	JULIANNE	Chill? Since when do you say ch...
M	DIGGER	When I'm talking to children.
F	JULIANNE	You flew all the way h...
M	DIGGER	I noticed. I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
F	JULIANNE	You're butting in.
F	JULIANNE	I really resent this.
F	JULIANNE	What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
M	DIGGER	You like her.
F	JULIANNE	If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
F	JULIANNE	Last night, she was crying, these big, real tears, when she thought she'd lost him. It was like there was a knife in her heart...
F	JULIANNE	... and I put it there. I hated myself, I grieved for her, I couldn't enjoy one second of it! And then, when it didn't work...
F	JULIANNE	I was devastated.
M	DIGGER	Go figure you.
F	JULIANNE	Because I realized. When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart. And it will be there every...
F	JULIANNE	... every time I think of him, forever, which could be a lot.
F	JULIANNE	You watch a guy caress his girlfriend's butt. You see an Old Spice commercial. Sentimental moments are everywhere, when you're in the right frame of mind.
F	JULIANNE	There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
M	DIGGER	You've been working on this, huh?
F	JULIANNE	... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
F	JULIANNE	This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
M	DIGGER	And you believe that.
F	JULIANNE	Sure.
F	JULIANNE	He was in love with me every day for nine years. I can make him happier than she can.
M	DIGGER	It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
F	JULIANNE	I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
M	DIGGER	Impressive.
F	JULIANNE	I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
M	DIGGER	The man you love.
F	JULIANNE	Beyond reason. The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
M	DIGGER	Someday she'll thank you.
F	JULIANNE	Let's not get carried away.
F	JULIANNE	I'd settle for. Someday, I'll forgive myself.
F	JULIANNE	For doing this terrible thing.
F	JULIANNE	Which, by the way, I can't figure out how to do.
M	DIGGER	Jesus. You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
F	JULIANNE	I KNOW THAT! I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
F	JULIANNE	Guess what I brushed my teeth with last night?
M	DIGGER	Zit cream?
F	JULIANNE	I wish.
M	DIGGER	Neosporin?
F	JULIANNE	Try less appropriate.
M	DIGGER	Ben Gay.
F	JULIANNE	That was Thursday.
M	DIGGER	Elmer's Glue?
F	JULIANNE	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
M	DIGGER	I give.
F	JULIANNE	I can't even say it.
F	JULIANNE	A hint. The first word is "Preparation." Then comes a letter of the alphabet, perilously close to G.
M	DIGGER	Considering the circumstances, I'm not wholly against suicide...
M	DIGGER	Just not by electrocution in front of me!
M	DIGGER	I've got this noon flight.
F	JULIANNE	How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
M	DIGGER	What do you suggest?
F	JULIANNE	Maybe they just seal off this room. They have others.
M	DIGGER	I didn't mean about that.
F	JULIANNE	If I hear the words "tell the truth," or any paraphrase thereof, I dive into the sink and pull you with me.
M	DIGGER	Let's go meet Michael. I'll wait downstairs.
M	DIGGER	I suppose it's too late to start over.
F	JULIANNE	It's too late to start over.
M	MICHAEL	You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
F	JULIANNE	Like I said, dazzling.
M	DIGGER	Is she going to dress you every day?
M	MICHAEL	Yeah, it's in the contract.
M	DIGGER	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
M	DIGGER	The cut here, here... this line...
M	DIGGER	... trouser width, this is all classic. Which means safe, something I'd wear.
M	MICHAEL	I should look different.
M	DIGGER	You should look like you dressed yourself.
M	MICHAEL	And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
M	DIGGER	Something like that.
M	MICHAEL	Long trip. Pretty nice of you to come.
M	DIGGER	Well, I'm close to her. I wanted to meet the one that got away.
M	DIGGER	What?
M	MICHAEL	I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
M	MICHAEL	Stay, huh?
M	DIGGER	I honestly wish I could...
M	MICHAEL	I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
F	JULIANNE	They'd say that's my job.
F	JULIANNE	I'll take it home from here.
M	DIGGER	Two words.
F	JULIANNE	Major. Dish.
M	DIGGER	Manicure...
M	DIGGER	Fly.
M	MICHAEL	You don't miss much.
M	DIGGER	Part of being a New Yorker.
F	JULIANNE	Bye, handsome.
F	JULIANNE	You're going to say it, aren't you?
M	DIGGER	Tell him you love him. With all your heart.
F	JULIANNE	I'm taking my next book to Viking.
M	DIGGER	Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
F	JULIANNE	I'm moving this book to Viking.
M	DIGGER	Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
F	JULIANNE	Needing.
M	DIGGER	To belong to someone.
M	DIGGER	We all do, beautiful. I'm sorry about that.
M	DIGGER	Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him. But there it is, and he has to choose.
F	JULIANNE	And what will he do?
M	DIGGER	He'll choose Kim. You'll stand by her at her wedding. You'll kiss him good-bye. And you'll go home.
M	DIGGER	This is what you've come to do. Now do it.
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	Big weddings are so strange. You keep saying that.
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
M	JULIANNE (O.S.)	Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
F	JULIANNE	Getting your bed made. Every day.
F	JULIANNE	You miss her, huh?
M	MICHAEL	No. I've got you.
M	MICHAEL	Don't you throw up on boat?
F	JULIANNE	If you like.
M	MICHAEL	I've been thinking a lot the last couple days. About us, actually.
F	JULIANNE	Have you.
F	JULIANNE	Well. There's a lot of memories to choose from...
M	MICHAEL	It's more than that.
M	MICHAEL	I mean, it's embarrassing to say it this way, but...
M	MICHAEL	You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
F	JULIANNE	You've been the man in mine.
M	MICHAEL	And I was thinking this could be our last time. Alone. Together. You know?
F	JULIANNE	Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
M	MICHAEL	Except for that.
M	MICHAEL	I can hardly wait for your wedding.
F	JULIANNE	Me either.
M	MICHAEL	Boy, I never thought I'd hear you say that. Can I come?
F	JULIANNE	I couldn't have it without you.
M	MICHAEL	It's normal to have... second thoughts, huh? To be scared.
F	JULIANNE	I wouldn't know. I never had that many first thoughts.
M	MICHAEL	I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know? You forget you... chose it.
M	MICHAEL	You and I. I mean, in all our relationships with other people... We didn't use the word "love" a lot, did we?
M	MICHAEL	Kimmy says. When you love someone. You say it, you say it out loud. Right now. Or the moment...
M	MICHAEL	... passes you by, yeah. She's a smart girl.
M	MICHAEL	We don't have a song.
M	MICHAEL	Kimmy and I. We don't have a song. Is that a bad sign?
M	MICHAEL	Someday, when I'm awfully low... And the world is cold...
M	MICHAEL	I will feel a glow just Thinking of you... And the way you look. Tonight.
M	MICHAEL	Dance card filled?
F	JULIANNE	I'll check. I have it on powerbook, these days.
M	MICHAEL	With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart...
M	MICHAEL	And that laugh That wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart.
M	MICHAEL	Where did we first hear th...
F	JULIANNE	The night we met.
F	JULIANNE	The night we fell in love.
M	MICHAEL	So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
F	JULIANNE	We danced to it. Just like this.
M	MICHAEL	I won't lose you, will I?
F	JULIANNE	No. Because I won't let you.
F	WALTER	I thought Michael was picking me up.
F	JULIANNE	I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring. I'll collect the inconsequentials.
F	WALTER	Kim said, when he turned down the job, there was no friction.
F	JULIANNE	Friction. No.
F	WALTER	I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
F	JULIANNE	Nobody has. So far.
F	WALTER	Well, you're a little early...
F	JULIANNE	I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
F	JULIANNE	You can do this.
F	JULIANNE	E-mail address. To Ben Isaacson, Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated, from... Walter Wallace.
F	JULIANNE	See, you can do it. It's easy.
F	JULIANNE	You do it fast, it's over. Like it never happened.
F	JULIANNE	Ben. I need a favor.
F	JULIANNE	My daughter's every happiness. And my wife's. And, least of all, my own, are in your hands.
F	JULIANNE	Knowing you value our friendship, and the... cooperative relationship between our companies... I am hopeful of your help.
F	JULIANNE	I have offered Mike O'Neal, my new son-in-law, a great opportunity in my company. This would also enable my daughter to settle in Chicago, near us, and pursue her dreams and plans.
F	JULIANNE	To his own detriment, as well as ours, Michael will not accept our offer. While he works for you.
F	JULIANNE	My daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation and discretion.
F	JULIANNE	With gratitude. For your understanding. Walter.
F	JULIANNE	Are you crazy? Get him fired?
F	JULIANNE	Just till tonight when I bring him back. To look for...
F	WALTER	Off to rehearsal. Send out this, and this, not this, this, and... that's it.
F	WALTER	I'm holding four or five E-mails I wrote over lunch...
F	WALTER	Send 'em out.
F	MANDY	Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
M	SAMMY	... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
M	MINISTER	Billy Dyer, Julianne. And I love the suit.
M	MICHAEL	Takes me back.
F	JULIANNE	Well.
F	JULIANNE	You sang the song. Least I could do was wear the outfit.
M	MICHAEL	Except now you're better- looking.
M	MICHAEL	I got the ring.
M	MANDY/SAMMY	Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow... Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot...
M	MANDY/SAMMY	Comin', to car-ryyy Me ho-o-o-me...
F	JULIANNE	No accents today.
M	MICHAEL	Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act. Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
M	MICHAEL	Will she like it?
F	JULIANNE	Yes.
M	KIMMY (O.S.)	My groom-person! Your family needs you!
M	MANDY/SAMMY	Well, I look over yon-der, And what did I see-ee-ee?
M	MANDY/SAMMY	Comin too car-ryyy. Me ho-o-ome...
M	MANDY/SAMMY	It was a hand. Of a-a-angels. Coming' for me-e-ee...
M	MANDY/SAMMY	Comin' for to carry me home.
M	JOE	Like to welcome ever'body to our little rehearsal supper...
M	JOE	Okay, everyone stand up!
M	JOE	To the bride, uh, goes the honor... of cracking the first crab!
F	KIMMY	But first, a toast!
F	JULIANNE	I'm right-handed.
F	KIMMY	To our host, my cuddly Papa Joe.
F	KIMMY	Who taught me to play "Blue Hawaii." On my nose.
M	MANDY/SAMMY (O.S.)	Boo!!!
F	MANDY	I know why you're scared of our party. It's too hip.
M	SAMMY	Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill. Walter supplied the decorative touches...
M	SAMMY	Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
F	MANDY	... I'm partial to the tight end.
M	SAMMY	This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef. With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
M	SAMMY	And yet here you are. All celibate and reclusive.
F	MANDY	With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
F	JULIANNE	Well, I'm worried about something.
F	JULIANNE	Oh. I left this really important file in Walter's office. I have to send my editor some...
F	JULIANNE	... figures. On territorial sales. To close my book deal.
F	JULIANNE	So Kim gave me the key. And Michael's on his way, to drive me down to Wal...
M	SAMMY	Oh. We thought it was the ring.
F	MANDY	The one you better get the fuck off your third finger left hand.
F	JULIANNE	Well. See. That was a... reflex to see if it would...
F	MANDY	... look good on Kimberly.
F	JULIANNE	Right. And then it didn't want to come off. Exactly.
M	SAMMY	Maybe it's happy there.
F	MANDY	Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
M	SAMMY	He said you told him. It'd be safer with you.
F	MANDY	An so it is.
F	MANDY	Shut up, sugar, he's on his way. Let's get to work.
M	EIGHT PEOPLE	TWIST IT! TWIST IT!
M	JANITOR	It's mental, lady, you ain't trying!
M	SAMMY	There is nothing so tight, this can't help it...
F	MANDY	I saw this on Hard Copy. People cut off body parts and the hospital sew 'em back o...
F	JULIANNE	I saw the show.
F	MANDY	... well, maybe it works on fingers, too. Aunt Mandy...?
M	FLOWER GIRL	Mr. Michael's here.
F	MANDY	Don't worry, baby. You could pick your nose with that finger and Michael would never notice. He's a man.
M	MANDY (O.S.)	Personally, I think Mr. Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
M	SAMMY (O.S.)	You're much more his type.
F	JULIANNE	I can't believe this!
M	MICHAEL	It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
F	JULIANNE	ISN'T THERE A GUARD? A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR! SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
F	JULIANNE	WHERE'S A BRICK? FIND ME A GODDAMN BRICK!!
M	MICHAEL	What is the big deal about getting this file tonight?
F	JULIANNE	I promised Digger I'd E-mail him those figures.
F	JULIANNE	They are very important figures.
F	JULIANNE	I'm up against a deadline.
M	MICHAEL	Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
F	JULIANNE	That's my point!!
F	JULIANNE	I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be busy with more important things. So...
F	JULIANNE	... tonight's my last chance.
M	MICHAEL	I forgot how cute you look. When you get impossible.
F	JULIANNE	It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
F	JULIANNE	We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
M	MICHAEL	Tomorrow is Sunday. Nobody's doing business. Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
M	MICHAEL	Give it up, kid.
M	MICHAEL	You can't win 'em all.
M	MICHAEL	Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
F	JULIANNE	You're right. Easy come, easy go.
M	MICHAEL	Jules?
M	MICHAEL	This thing means that much to y...
F	JULIANNE	It means a lot.
M	MICHAEL	I'll call the house, Walter's probably not even asleep...
M	MICHAEL	I'll drive you out there, we'll get the key, we'll go back to the office...
M	MICHAEL	Come on, we'll call from your room.
M	MICHAEL	If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow...
M	MICHAEL	... you better be there to... funny, these are all from Ben.
M	MICHAEL	The fax is from Ben, too. Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
F	JULIANNE	... maybe it's congratulations.
F	JULIANNE	Michael? What ha...
M	MICHAEL	Mike. I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding. But I think you need and deserve to know...
M	MICHAEL	... what you're marrying into.
F	JULIANNE	I received the following E-mail this afternoon... "Ben, I need a favor. My daughter's every happiness... "
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	Isabelle? I need to talk to Kim...
F	JULIANNE	"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..." I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks.
F	JULIANNE	"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
M	MICHAEL	Jules. Could you give me a minute?
M	MICHAEL	Please?
M	BELLMAN	Miss, are you locked out, or something?
F	JULIANNE	No, I just stepped out, because... it's a non-smoking room.
M	BELLMAN	Well, it's non-smoking floor, too. Maybe you could go to the...
F	JULIANNE	Why don't you have me arrested?
F	JULIANNE	I mean that. Arrested, convicted, put in solitary.
F	JULIANNE	See, I'm a dangerous, criminal person. I do bad things to honest people. This, see, this smoking? Tip of the iceberg.
F	JULIANNE	Make a citizen's arrest, I won't struggle. It'll be like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.
M	BELLMAN	Can I... Can I help you, miss?
F	JULIANNE	Do you smoke, Richard?
M	BELLMAN	Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...
F	JULIANNE	... a non-smoking floor, yeah. Well, you know what?
M	BELLMAN	My grandmother always said, "This, too, shall pass."
F	JULIANNE	Thanks, Richard. If you weren't on duty, I'd buy you a drink.
F	JULIANNE	What happened?
M	MICHAEL	It's over.
M	MICHAEL	I want you to quit this shit, it'll kill you.
M	MICHAEL	She denied it. Said I was crazy and paranoid.
F	JULIANNE	A bad combination.
M	MICHAEL	morning? At her place.
M	MICHAEL	She said "How can I call everything off, what do I tell everybody?"
F	JULIANNE	Michael...
M	MICHAEL	No, it's for the best, it really is. We were so wrong for each other.
F	JULIANNE	Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
M	MICHAEL	The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway. She couldn't have lived with it. I know that now.
M	MICHAEL	And she's right, I'm crazy to fall for someone. I hardly knew.
M	MICHAEL	Hey. You still got that ring?
F	JULIANNE	I tried it on. But it won't come off.
F	JULIANNE	It's mental, you know.
F	JULIANNE	Should we take a walk? Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
M	MICHAEL	I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
M	MICHAEL	Maybe I'll go back to New York. Hang with you for awhile, huh? Ben'll understand.
M	MICHAEL	Or we'll go somewhere. If you have the time.
F	JULIANNE	If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
F	JULIANNE	I've never been to Texas.
M	MICHAEL	Thanks for coming to my wedding.
M	DIGGER (V.O. MACHINE)	Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning. Brevity is even more in order than usual.
F	JULIANNE	Hey, handsome. Brevity this...
F	JULIANNE	I won.
F	JULIANNE	Amazing, huh? I didn't do things quite your way. But... I got it down.
F	JULIANNE	And forty years and nine grand- children later, when I sit with Michael on some rustic porch, slogging through our sweet swamp of nostalgic memories...
F	JULIANNE	No one is going to sweet the details...
F	JULIANNE	Of one weekend in Chicago.
F	JULIANNE	Talk about celebration...
F	JULIANNE	I'm gonna brush my teeth with actual toothpaste.
F	JULIANNE	I guess I'm too exhausted to feel the elation I so richly undeserve...
F	JULIANNE	So I'm gonna hold calls at the desk... while I get my...
F	JULIANNE	God, it is toothpaste, they should sell this stuff commercially! Anyway, a girl does need her...
F	JULIANNE	... well, we're a bit past worrying about beauty sleep. Let's just settle for not frightening small animals.
F	JULIANNE	Anyway, I couldn't have done it without you. Even though I did, if you follow that.
F	JULIANNE	Three words: Happily. Ever. Well, you know.
F	JULIANNE	You're going where?
F	ISABELLE	Jules. We're so glad you slept in.
F	ISABELLE	Now, you have a choice. The idea is bride and groom shouldn't see each other on the magic day...
F	ISABELLE	So Michael stays put in the garden. Kimmy stays in here...
M	ISABELLE (O.S.)	... and the guests go back and forth. Where will you start?
F	JULIANNE	She looks tense.
F	ISABELLE	Nerves. I would never have guessed.
F	JULIANNE	I had the craziest dream last night? Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
M	MICHAEL	Look, I came down here to face everybody. I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
F	JULIANNE	But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
M	MICHAEL	She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
F	JULIANNE	Get married, apparently.
F	JULIANNE	What the hell are you thinking of, the goddamn wedding is SIX O'CLOCK!!
M	MICHAEL	This is her family and her fault.
F	JULIANNE	And your point?
M	MICHAEL	Well. How come she didn't...
F	JULIANNE	YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
M	MICHAEL	Hey. This is a serious matter.
F	JULIANNE	I'll be right back.
F	KIMMY	Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
F	JULIANNE	They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
F	JULIANNE	You guys want to give us a minute?
F	JULIANNE	We'd like to be alone with our pork.
F	KIMMY	How's he doing?
F	JULIANNE	Who? The jerk who's running your life?
F	KIMMY	This must be... very, very, hard on him.
F	JULIANNE	What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
F	JULIANNE	When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
F	KIMMY	Don't you see...
F	JULIANNE	If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
F	KIMMY	... that this is all my fault?
F	KIMMY	Whatever delusions I drove him to, there is truth at the heart of it. I want him to work for my father. I want to stay in school. I want a life of my own!
F	JULIANNE	Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
F	KIMMY	I love him.
F	KIMMY	Tell him it's my fault and that I love him.
F	JULIANNE	I'll be right back.
M	MICHAEL	How is she?
F	JULIANNE	KNOCK IT OFF!!!
M	STONER KID	YES, SIR!
M	MICHAEL	I asked you...
F	JULIANNE	She admits it's her fault.
M	MICHAEL	Do you think she still loves me?
F	JULIANNE	Sure, she does. She's crazy about you.
M	MICHAEL	I keep asking, how can I explain what happened? And I keep getting that same answer all night long.
M	MICHAEL	I can't. And it doesn't matter. I drove her to it, because I want things my way. And even if she did something tricky and unfair... she was blinded by love, okay?
F	JULIANNE	Does that make it right...
M	MICHAEL	Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
M	MICHAEL	She's giving up half her life for me, and I'm bitching because it hurts her.
M	STONERS	Sail on silver girl Sail on by...
M	MICHAEL	She's a saint! And I'm a worthless ingrate!
M	STONERS	Your time has come to shine, All your dreams are on their way...
M	MICHAEL	Tell her. I'll marry her at six o'clock, if she'll still have me.
F	JULIANNE	I'll be right back.
F	KIMMY	So. What did he say?
F	JULIANNE	He said. Marry me.
M	MICHAEL	Thank God you were here.
F	JULIANNE	Oh, yeah.
M	MICHAEL	I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
F	JULIANNE	Well, it happens.
M	MICHAEL	I might have thrown away...
F	JULIANNE	... your one chance for true happiness?
M	MICHAEL	... yeah, that.
F	JULIANNE	You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. As they say in the sport biz.
M	MICHAEL	Are you okay?
F	JULIANNE	The Big Hurt, huh?
M	MICHAEL	Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys.
F	JULIANNE	Got a minute?
F	JULIANNE	Why is the dance floor by the gazebo?
M	MICHAEL	Kimmy's idea. She thought it would be such a romantic place. For our wedding dance.
M	MICHAEL	What's up?
F	JULIANNE	Shhh.
F	JULIANNE	I have to say this quick, okay, or I'll have this massive coronary and you'll never have to hear it. Which you need to. Does that make any sense at all?
M	MICHAEL	Jules, what's wrong...
F	JULIANNE	This is the dumbest thing I will ever do. So dumb, in fact, that I can't. I don't think.
F	JULIANNE	Michael, I love you.
F	JULIANNE	I've loved you for nine years, but I was too arrogant and scared to realize it. Now I'm just scared.
F	JULIANNE	I know this comes at an inopportune time, but I have to ask this one really gigantic favor, okay?
F	JULIANNE	Choose me. Marry me. Let me make you happy.
F	JULIANNE	I know. It sounds like three favors.
F	JULIANNE	But when you think about it...
F	JULIANNE	CATCH HER!!
F	JULIANNE	DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!
F	JULIANNE	DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS ANYMORE? WHATEVER HAPPENED TO TRUST?? THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!
F	JULIANNE	IT IS NOT GOING WELL! Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie, how we cookin' on that Skokiie infestation?
F	JULIANNE	THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING THE TRUTH!
M	FIELD MAN (O.S.)	Copy, dispatcher...
F	JULIANNE	OR EVEN PART OF IT!
M	FIELD MAN (O.S.)	Uh, what happens if you got that methyl-ethyl shit on your hands?
F	JULIANNE	GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS NOT FAIR! Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds before you're sterile. For God's sake don't touch yourself, or anything.
F	JULIANNE	AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR MACHINE!
M	YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)	Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra. It wasn't bees in the gal's wall, it was cats!
M	YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)	She says gas 'em, anyway, she'll pay cash. Uh... how do I pay this?
F	JULIANNE	MICHAEL!!
F	JULIANNE	NNNOOOO!!!
F	JULIANNE	Don't speak!
M	MICHAEL	Uh. I saw that moving...
F	JULIANNE	DON'T SPEAK!
F	JULIANNE	I have to make a confession. Another confession. Besides that I love you. This is even worse.
F	JULIANNE	The E-mail? You thought Walter sent your boss? I wrote that.
M	MICHAEL	You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
F	JULIANNE	... wrote it, yeah. I'm the bad guy.
M	MICHAEL	ARE YOU CRAZY?
M	MICHAEL	ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE??
M	MICHAEL	ARE YOU ON DRUGS???
M	MICHAEL	I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
F	JULIANNE	I didn't know it would get sent. I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
F	JULIANNE	I've done nothing but slimy, underhanded, despicable, not even terribly imaginative, things. Ever since I got here. Trying to...
F	JULIANNE	... to win you. To win you back.
F	JULIANNE	And I was blinded by love. Like you said.
F	JULIANNE	But that doesn't excuse any part of it. I am pond scum.
F	JULIANNE	Actually. Lower. I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum. Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
M	MICHAEL	Lower.
F	JULIANNE	Lower.
M	MICHAEL	The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
M	MICHAEL	On the other hand, thank you.
M	MICHAEL	For loving me that much, that way.
M	MICHEL	It's pretty flattering.
F	JULIANNE	Except it makes me fungus.
M	MICHAEL	Well, that part I knew.
F	JULIANNE	So you have to marry Kim. Because she will actually make you happy. I, in contrast, am a shallow, neurotic psychopath, with relatively little to offer.
F	JULIANNE	Kim. Nod your head. Do as you're told.
F	JULIANNE	Just promise you'll never tell me who you would have chosen. If I hadn't confessed.
F	JULIANNE	Cos if you would have chosen me. Then I threw away a perfectly good life. Just to be a decent person. Which is a questionable trade-off. Right?
F	JULIANNE	And if you would have chosen some 20-year-old punk over me. I'd have to kill myself.
M	MICHAEL	I'll take it to my grave.
F	JULIANNE	I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
M	MICHAEL	I came here, looking for her.
F	JULIANNE	Why would she come here...
M	MICHAEL	This is where I proposed.
M	MICHAEL	I had to cover a game in Milwaukee. She saw me off. And when the train started to leave... I jumped up on the step, I help the handle, and without...
M	MICHAEL	... without a thought in my head. I shouted, "Marry me."
M	MICHAEL	And she gasped, and covered her mouth, and the train was pulling out, and suddenly she screamed YES! Just once. And blew me a kiss.
M	MICHAEL	I never forgot that.
F	JULIANNE	It's two weeks.
M	MICHAEL	Almost three.
F	JULIANNE	That is so romantic.
M	MICHAEL	I just wonder if you know why.
M	MICHAEL	It's because romance isn't mystery, and tricks, and doubts, and halting, unspoken longings. That's not the real romance.
M	MICHAEL	The real romance is saying yes.
M	MICHAEL	Woulda been a nice wedding.
F	JULIANNE	You can't believe you've lost her! Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
F	JULIANNE	Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock. You've got a lot of explaining to...
M	MICHAEL	I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over.
F	JULIANNE	That's little egotistical.
F	JULIANNE	But, undoubtedly accurate.
F	JULIANNE	Okay, we'll split up. You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
M	MICHAEL	If you find her...
M	MICHAEL	The kiss. May be hard. For you to explain. Because the only fear she really has, is...
F	JULIANNE	... me, yeah. And she likes Tommy Lasorda. Case closed.
M	MICHAEL	But if you do get to her first...
M	MICHAEL	There is something you are authorized to say.
M	MANDY (V.O.)	Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
F	JULIANNE	It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
M	MANDY (V.O.)	Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey. Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty. Or crying in her nachos, down at Comskey Park.
F	JULIANNE	Ex-cuse me? I had this crank call? From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
F	JULIANNE	You are so right. What a nerve on that guy! Bring my dress to church, huh?
F	JULIANNE	I want to pick up a little something for the ceremony.
M	BODYGUARD	She wouldn't confide in me, so I called the house.
M	BODYGUARD	Luckily, I got her cousin.
F	JULIANNE	Going to the john, she said?
M	BODYGUARD	Could be there awhile.
F	JULIANNE	YO! IMMIGRATION!
F	JULIANNE	I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY WALLACE!
F	KIMMY	In here, you bitch!
F	JULIANNE	Let me in, baby, or I'll rip this damn thing off its non- code-compliant hinges... GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FACE OR I'M GONNA MESS YOUR SHIT UP!!
F	KIMMY	Over here, nitwit!
F	JULIANNE	Incoming.
F	JULIANNE	Pitiful.
F	KIMMY	Haven't you done enough?
F	JULIANNE	In one minute. You are going to feel so foolish.
F	KIMMY	WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
F	JULIANNE	Have you ever heard of. Irony?
F	JULIANNE	I threw my arms around your husband. And kissed him with all my heart. Because I was so happy. For you. Nitwit.
F	JULIANNE	He's going to take... The job!
F	JULIANNE	With your dad, yeah. Can you guess why? Bitch?
F	KIMMY	HE LOVES ME!!
F	JULIANNE	Well, of course, he loves you.
F	JULIANNE	Hell, even I love you.
F	JULIANNE	I never want to go through this again.
F	KIMMY	That's entirely understandable. Shit! THE TIME!
M	SAMMY	Whatever hap...
F	JULIANNE	We were bonding, we lost track, we're officially sorry, now let's put it behind us.
F	JULIANNE	Believe me, we got a bride who's worth waiting for, yes?
F	JULIANNE	Out of our way.
F	JULIANNE	Don't worry, sugar.
F	JULIANNE	be as if...
F	JULIANNE	... he's never seen a woman before.
F	WALTER	Left foot.
M	MINISTER	Michael and Kimmy wrote these words. She asked me to confide, mostly Michael.
M	MINISTER	So he gets to say them.
M	MICHAEL	Why do people get married anymore?
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	Why not live together amicably, with no sense of obligation beyond the moment?
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	As long as the sex is good. As long as no one more interesting has wandered into view. As long as the thousand conflicts of two individual wills remain comfortably compromised.
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	And when one feels the urge to move on, to explore the new. No guilt, no disgrace, no promise broken. No agony of having dishonored a time. When our hearts. And the world were different.
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	Marriage is a lot to put up with.
M	MICHAEL (O.S.)	The answer must be. That there is some need basic to the human heart. That embracing... the obligation of commitment... fulfills. Some need to belong to one another in a way which rages against the notion... that all is impermanent. Against the notion of mortality. Our love is bigger. And longer. Than life itself.
M	MICHAEL	That's what we want. And marriage. Is what we do about it.
M	MICHAEL	We are fools in this. Thank God Almighty.
M	MINISTER	Boy, that was good!
M	MINISTER	Michael and Kim also edited what they want me to say...
M	MINISTER	The idea was, we're only marrying once. We have to remember it forever. Let's keep to the good stuff. You may kiss the bride. If anyone here can show just cause why this man and woman should not be married, speak now. Or forever hold your peace.
M	MICHAEL	Kimberly. I promise to love. And respect and comfort you. To hear your voice and your heart. Until we are parted by death.
F	KIMMY	Michael. I promise to love and respect and comfort you. To hear your voice and your heart. Until we are parted by death.
M	MINISTER	For the record, you each agree to marry the other?
F	KIMMY	I do!
M	MICHAEL	I do.
M	MINISTER	We haven't said much about God this evening, I know. But He is here. And He is happy. To bless His wonderful children.
M	MINISTER (O.S.)	In that Michael and Kimberly have given themselves to each other by solemn vows, and the exchanging of rings...
M	MINISTER (O.S.)	I pronounce them husband and wife. Those whom God has joined together, let no one put asunder.
M	MINISTER (O.S.)	Now. Kiss the bride.
F	JULIANNE	I'm a writer, too, not as good as Michael. But I do steal from quality.
F	JULIANNE	This is to my best friend. On the occasion of his wedding.
F	JULIANNE	If I have truly come to know your bride as my new sister. This is in her heart...
F	JULIANNE	"Understand. I'll slip quietly away from the noisy crowd when I see the pale stars rising, blooming, over the oaks."
F	JULIANNE	"I'll pursue solitary pathways through the pale twilit meadows, with only this one dream: You come too."
F	JULIANNE	I don't have a wedding gift. But this is on loan. Until you two find your song...
M	MANDY/SAMMY	Someday, when I'm awfully low, And the world is cold, I will feel a glow just thinking of you, And the way you look tonight.
M	MANDY/SAMMY	You're lovely. With your smile so warm, And your cheeks so soft, There is nothing for me but to love you, Just the way you look tonight.
M	MANDY/SAMMY	With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart... And the laugh that wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart.
M	JULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY	You're lovely, please don't ever change, Keep that breathless charm, Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you... Just the way you look tonight. that she will never see him before...
M	MICHAEL	Wherever I go. However far...
F	JULIANNE	You win a few, you lose a few. Some get rained out.
M	DIGGER	You have a good time?
F	JULIANNE	I did what I came to do.
M	DIGGER	Good girl. I was thinking. Maybe you might visit us for awhile. We've got the room made up.
F	JULIANNE	I'll think about it. I'm okay.
M	DIGGER (V.O.)	Oh, you're more than okay.
F	JULIANNE	You, too.
F	JULIANNE	If the sun comes up, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
M	DIGGER (V.O.)	I'll play those odds. You have sweet dreams.
