M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	MARIE	Today's the day, Mom... You here again, Marie?
F	MARIE	Just leaving.
M	RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)	... operation, aimed at finally capturing the Black Widow suspect after a six month trail of embezzlement and fraud, once again failed to snare its subject.
M	RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)	Blue Bay Police Detective Michael Morrison was able to recover over $400,000 in stolen money, but the suspect, described as Female, between eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
F	MARIE	I'm... so... sorry...
F	ELENA	You will be.
F	JENNY	Happy birthday, babe. They ain't diamonds, but you're just gonna have to wait for those...
F	MARIE	Thank you. Thank you so much...
F	JENNY	Are you OK, hon?
F	MARIE	I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's just...that new girl...I almost hit her in the parking lot...
F	JENNY	You mean the towel girl, the one who transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You know the only reason she's slinging towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
M	MOSSTER	We're here today to address a growing epidemic that affects all of you.
M	MOSSTER	National studies report sexual activity among students at an all-time high.
M	MOSSTER	We'll see who's cheering when you've got an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or get slapped with a paternity suit...Or arrested for date rape. But don't take my word for it...
M	PRINCIPAL MOSSTER	Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to tell you about the pitfalls first hand...
F	KRISTEN	Good morning, my name is Kristen Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami juvenile parole board, as some of you already know...
F	KRISTEN	But that's not what brings me here today. When I heard about Principal Mosster's sex education program I thought I'd volunteer my own personal story, in hopes that you might learn from the mistakes I made. Back in High school all I wanted to do was get drunk, stoned and laid...
F	KRISTEN	By my junior year, my life was a blur of cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every night of the week...
F	ELENA	...whore...
F	KRISTEN	And then, one night at some pathetic frat party, someone slipped a roofie in my drink...and raped me.
F	KRISTEN	There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't crawl when I think of the violation and humiliation I endured. I can promise you that if you make the same kind of wrong- headed choices I did, you'll be seeing Dr. Borman...
F	CHAD	Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr. Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at the police department, where my work has helped convict hundreds of sex offenders. Most teens like Ms. Richards never get their lives together. The physical scars may go away, but the emotional damage stays forever.
M	MUDDY	That's not...what I think it is, is it?
F	ELENA	Whattchya think it is, bitch?
M	MUDDY	One of them...Parole leashes...
F	ELENA	Bingo.
M	MUDDY	So you can't, like, go more than ten miles from the cop shop?
F	ELENA	Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.
F	CHAD	And as for the perpetrators of this heinous act, even if you are still a minor, you will be tried as an adult, and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
F	CHAD	Are there any questions?
F	ELENA	Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.
F	KRISTEN	Ask away.
F	ELENA	When they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity, you sued his sorry ass, right?
F	KRISTEN	Uh, no, actually, I was never able to make a positive ID. All I remember was his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll never forget..."
F	ELENA	So what you're really saying is you fucked for free...
M	PRINCIPAL MOSSTER	Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young lady! Blue Bay High School would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri-county region...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	First up, district champion Marie Clifford...
M	JAY	C'mon now baby, you can do it...
F	JENNY	Your stepfather's just got a lot invested in the team.
M	JAY	Just try to keep those legs together.
M	ELENA (O.S.)	Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen Virgin.
M	JAY	Excuse me?
F	ELENA	You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in Clifford construction?
M	JAY	I am, yes, but...
F	ELENA	I'd love to see one of your erections...
M	JAY	Nice take off, gotta work on the landing...
F	MARIE	I can't do any better...
M	JAY	No such word as 'can't. Now do it again. Only better...
F	ELENA	Bet you choke.
F	MARIE	What's your major malfunction?
F	ELENA	Just wanted to make a wager. Between best friends.
F	ELENA	You blow this dive, I get those diamonds of yours.
F	MARIE	How'd you know about my inheritance?
F	ELENA	Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's the day, right?
F	MARIE	And what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when I win?
F	ELENA	I'll stay away from your stepfather. You make it, I won't be your new stepmom anytime soon. Whattya say?
F	MARIE	Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.
F	ELENA	Choke! J ENNY What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that one judge only gave you a 9.7?
F	MARIE	Nah. I'm cool.
F	JENNY	Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe. You got diamonds on the mind.
M	JAY (O.S.)	Have either of you seen my video camera?
M	JAY	I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...
M	JAY	Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.
M	JAY	She's become every inch of the woman her Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is now, Julie's looking down and smiling.
M	JAY	And that's why, on your eighteenth birthday, Marie, I know your mother wanted you to have...
M	JAY	... she wanted you to have... a wonderful birthday party surrounded by all your friends.
M	JAY	Please excuse me.
F	MARIE	Jay! What about my present?
F	MARIE	Jay?
M	H	e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in
M	JAY (O.S.)	It simply can't be done... In all construction there's delays.
M	MR. BARAJAS	Four months is not a delay. It's a disaster.
M	JAY	You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the building is almost finished. Just give me a week, two tops.
M	MR. BARAJAS	We are long past the negotiation stage.
M	MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)	For every day the building goes unfinished, we'll take a finger...
M	CICATRIZ	Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the eleventh day... J ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.
M	JAY	Marie! Shouldn't you be with your friends?
F	MARIE	I was just...
M	JAY	I'll be right there. With your gift... just... wait outside, OK?
F	JENNY	So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue Bay's richest bitch?
F	JENNY	Holy shit, who invited her?
F	MARIE	This is a private party...
F	ELENA	Don't mind me. I ain't here for your stupid party.
F	MARIE	Get the hell outta here! NOW!
F	ELENA	Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?
F	MARIE	Stay away from my stepfather!
F	ELENA	Make me... he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled What the hell's going on here?
F	MARIE	This...trash is just looking for a meal ticket...
F	ELENA	Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little Marie now, huh?
M	JAY	Party's over.
F	MARIE	But...what about...my present...
M	JAY	I'm going to the condos. Sleep it off, whydontcha?
M	JAY	Not enough. Just not enough... J
M	AY	Hello? Anyone there?
M	JAY (CONT'D)	Fuck me... Any time. Any place...
M	JAY	What are you doing here?
F	ELENA	You promised to show me your erection...
M	JAY	Is that my...camera?
F	ELENA	Lighten up, Jay.
M	JAY	Enough's enough. I think it's time you left.
F	ELENA	Is that any way to treat Marie's new best friend?
M	JAY	You're best friends are you?
F	ELENA	Sure. We've been having sleepovers. Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's been teaching me about shopping, I've been teaching her about giving mind blowing head...
M	JAY	Gimme the camera back...
F	ELENA	Come get it.
F	ELENA	Ooopppps.
F	MARIE	It's present time.
F	MARIE	What the hell...
M	JAY	What are you doing here at this time of night?
F	MARIE	I just...wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. I was out of line.
M	JAY	When we admit our mistakes we grow. You've made an important step.
F	MARIE	So...what about my present?
M	JAY	Meet me at the Museum. Before school tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep, I'm gonna finish up here...
M	JAY (O.S.)	You really think you're ready for your inheritance?
F	MARIE	It was...it was what Mom wanted...
M	JAY	You're the only one who can open that lock, but I'm the one with the key. She wanted you to have the diamonds when you were responsible enough to know what to do with them... M MARIE I'm...responsible...
M	JAY	Really? Underage drinking, prying into my personal affairs, fighting...
F	MARIE	But they're mine. Mom left them to me.
M	JAY	They're yours when I say they're yours. For the time being, I've got some major problems at the construction site. Deadlines have to be met. We'll talk again when you've done some growing up.
M	JAY	Please, don't fight me on this. We're Team Clifford, remember?
F	MARIE	Team Clifford...
F	MARIE	What the hell?
M	OFFICER ENTWISTLE	Mr. Clifford?
M	JAY	Can I help you, Officer?
M	OFFICER ENTWISTLE	You're under arrest on suspicion of rape.
M	JAY	There must be some mistake, this isn't possible...
F	MARIE	Jay, what's going on? AY Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down the station. This is outrageous...
M	JAY	I didn't do anything, I swear.
M	OFFICER ENTWISTLE	I'm afraid she's got a different story.
M	JAY	Who's 'she'?
F	KRISTEN	Elena.
F	KRISTEN	Could you tell me what happened?
F	ELENA	It was Jay Clifford. He raped me...
M	MORRISON	You understand the seriousness of this allegation, young lady?
M	MORRISON	And you know that we'll leave no stone un- turned in the investigation. There'll be a battery of forensics tests you'll have to take, humiliating stuff. And background checks, digging up all kinds of dirt. And you'll have to testify in court, face the man you're accusing...
M	MORRISON	You sure you want to go through with this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk away right now....
F	KRISTEN	Please, Detective, this isn't the right time...
F	ELENA	I ain't lying. You think I'm lying?
F	KRISTEN	If you're telling the truth, you won't find a more sympathetic ear...
F	ELENA	'If' I'm telling the truth...
F	KRISTEN	And if you're not, there's gonna be trouble, you understand?
M	MORRISON	This is already trouble. The man you're accusing happens to be a friend of mine, and when the DNA tests prove you're lying I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks, mark my words...
M	THEO	We're gonna sue their asses til time runs backwards...
M	JAY	You've gotta believe me, I would never, could never do anything like this, you know that don't you?
F	MARIE	We're team Clifford.
M	JAY	That's my girl.
M	MORRISON	Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom...
M	MORRISON	Would you mind waiting outside while me and your stepdad have a little chat...
M	JAY	It's OK honey. Michael and I are old pals...
M	JAY	How's the divorce treating you?
M	MORRISON	She's taken me for everything I'm worth. I swear to God, I'm never trusting another woman as long as I live. T heo intervenes...
M	THEO	This is most egregious, Detective, my client has pressing matters at his construction site. He can't afford to waste time with this frivolous nonsense...
M	MORRISON	Look, we're taking her statement right now, gonna run every forensic test in the book. Guarantee the case'll come apart like a $2 watch...
M	JAY	She had my camcorder. Recorded what happened. It should still be at the construction site. It'll clear my name...
M	MORRISON	You'll be outta here by tonight. I can't believe it, Jenny...It just doesn't make sense...I mean, I know Jay...I know he'd never...
F	MARIE	This can't be...
F	ELENA	No such word as 'can't'...
M	KRISTEN (O.S.)	Sexual predators often keep a trophy...
M	MORRISON	I'm sorry?
F	KRISTEN	Maybe he recorded the rape.
M	MORRISON	And maybe he didn't. We'll never know. Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take months to fix it.
M	MORRISON	We were never properly introduced. Michael Morrison.
F	KRISTEN	Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was just in town for a couple days checking in on some parolees when all this went down...
M	MORRISON	You think maybe you could lean on the girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We all know she's lying. With all this Black widow shit going down, we just don't have the time or manpower to...
F	KRISTEN	She might not be lying, you know.
M	MORRISON	What makes you think that?
F	KRISTEN	Just a look in her eye. I...I have some experience...
M	MORRISON	What the hell?
F	CHAD	Gotcha...
M	MORRISON	What is it?
F	CHAD	Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle. I'd say we've got a rape on our hands, Detective, but we won't know for sure until we run the tests...
M	MORRISON	Fine. Just do it...
F	ELENA	You vampires really need five pints of my blood? That's like an armful...
F	CHAD	It's standard procedure in a rape test. Test for drugs and such...
F	ELENA	And such.
F	CHAD	We're going to need a urine sample. Do you think you could fill this?
F	ELENA	From here? HAD If...you wouldn't mind...removing your clothes. I'll leave the room, give you some priv...
F	ELENA	Done. Next?
F	CHAD	Those are...
F	ELENA	Bite marks. He chowed down.
F	CHAD	They're clear evidence markers...
M	REPORTER 1	Any comment, Mr. Clifford?
M	REPORTER 2	Did your stepfather rape that girl? How could he do something like that? Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng
F	MARIE	Jay...is innocent...
M	JUDGE WILCOX	Order!
M	C	had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District
M	D.A. MEESE	Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the night of the 25th? CHAD Yes they do. D.A. MEESE Do they show that it was forced? tearing. We found no semen evidence. The latex abrasions point to the use of protection. This is quite common in cases of premeditated rape.
M	D.A. MEESE	And what can you tell us about Miss Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor?
F	CHAD	Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common date rape drug. Traces were also found on the bottle of beer at the crime scene. Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's fingerprints were all over the bottle.
M	JAY	I took it from her. She was far too young to be drinking!
M	D.A. MEESE	Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's been marked as state's exhibit number 1. He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life. An EVIDENCE
M	D.A. MEESE	What does this slide show? CHAD Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous bite marks on her upper torso that occurred during the rape.
M	JUDGE WILCOX	What about those other markings?
F	CHAD	I wasn't able to determine...Fingernail markings, possibly...
M	JUDGE WILCOX	Please continue.
M	D.A. MEESE	I'm going to show you another slide
M	that's been marked as state's exhibit	number 2.
M	What can you tell us about these	mouldings?
F	CHAD	They were made from the defendant's teeth, and the tests I conducted show there's simply no other conclusion. The bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were made by the defendant, Mr. Jay Clifford...
M	JUDGE WILCOX	Court's adjourned...
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	...in the face of damning evidence, Jay Clifford remained defiant. It's thought that his stepdaughter, Marie Clifford will testify in his defense tomorrow. And in other news, officials from the FBI gave a press conference today, commenting on their involvement in the Black widow case...
M	AGENT DAMMERS (ON TV)	After numerous mistakes on behalf of the local authorities in Blue Bay, the FBI is mobilizing its task force... It's a long shot.
M	MORRISON	Not a fan of 'Hey, how you doing', are you?
F	KRISTEN	Used to play at being a spider when I was a kid, creeping around silently. Guess I haven't grown out of it. ORRISON It's the only thing standing between my friend and a ten year stretch...
F	KRISTEN	at it now...the Feds have taken over the Black widow case...
M	MORRISON	Goddamn gloryhounds. They knew I was close. They just want to come in and take all the credit.
M	RISTEN	You got a chance, Detective. To help your friend. Don't let this case slip away as well...
M	MORRISON	Chad, I got a rush job for you.
F	CHAD	No can do, boss. We're sifting through the Black Widow evidence...
M	MORRISON	Feds are movin' in. They'll be taking over by the case by the end of the week.
M	MORRISON	You find anything on that tape, you let me know, OK?
F	CHAD	Whatever you say, boss.
M	MORRISON	And make sure you get that money back into the evidence locker. A nd Chad's left alone with the shattered remains of the video
F	ELENA	Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing...
F	MARIE	What the hell are you doing here?
F	ELENA	Looks like your bling ain't blinging...
F	MARIE	Give me that back. It was my Mother's...
F	ELENA	Looks like she got ripped off Princess, where's the rock?
F	MARIE	Is that what this is all about?
F	ELENA	You're not a dumb as you look... J enny, followed by the rest of the diving team, come marching out
F	JENNY	We got trouble...
F	MARIE	You're ruining my life, and my stepfather's.
F	ELENA	It can end. Just like that.
F	MARIE	Why are you doing this?
F	ELENA	Because I can.
M	ELENA (CONT'D)	Good luck in court.
M	THEO	And why did you go to your stepfather's building site that night, Miss Clifford?
F	MARIE	It was my birthday. Jay left the party before giving me my present.
M	THEO	And you say you saw Miss Sandoval leaving?
F	MARIE	I did.
M	THEO	And how would you describe her appearance?
F	MARIE	She was...she looked fine. She smiled at me. Actually smiled...
M	THEO	No further questions.
M	D.A. MEESE	Would it be fair to say you don't like Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford? M MARIE We don't see...eye to eye...
M	D.A. MEESE	Is that why you attacked her at your party earlier that night?
F	MARIE	No...I was...she wasn't invited...
M	D.A. MEESE	You'd had a few drinks, correct?
F	MARIE	I'd had a drink. Yes.
M	D.A. MEESE	So by the time you allege to have seen Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court exactly how much you'd had to drink?
F	MARIE	A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...
M	D.A. MEESE	No further questions.
F	CHAD	Take out the chroma, raise the luminescence...
F	KRISTEN	H oly shit...
M	KRISTEN (CONT'D)	Call Detective Morrison. Now... You're kidding right?
M	JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)	C'mon now baby, you can do it... Please...you can't do this...
M	JAY (O.S ON TAPE)	No such word as can't...
M	JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)	Fuck me...
M	LENA (ON TAPE)	Please, Mr. Clifford, don't... Just try to keep those legs together...
M	D.A. MEESE	If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to rape, the state is prepared to drop the If I were you I would seriously consider the offer.
M	JAY	I'm gonna lose this trial.
M	THEO	I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a fake, right? So all we need to do is...
M	JAY	You had your chance. If we're gonna win at all costs, we're gonna have to change the game. Do you have it?
M	THEO	I'm still dead set against this, Jay.
M	JAY	I couldn't care less.
F	MARIE	What's the key for?
M	JAY	then that's what it takes...
F	MARIE	But...they're my inheritance...
M	JAY	All my assets are tied up in the condos, Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make her testify that she faked the tape, faked the evidence.
F	MARIE	But, Jay...they're my diamonds...
M	JAY	As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have them back. I swear. I know people, who can...persuade her to hand them over...
F	MARIE	t's wrong.
M	JAY	More wrong than what she's doing to us? We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm not guilty. You know I could never do anything like this. So do the right thing and get me out of this hellhole...
F	MARIE	I can't...
M	JAY	No such word as 'can't.' Please...
M	CURATOR	I knew the day would come, still doesn't make it any easier...
M	CURATOR	The offer still stands, Marie. If you ever decide to sell them, please give us a first chance...
F	MARIE	I don't think I'll be able to, I'm sorry...
M	CURATOR	Me too... LENA Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in... DA know you're here?
F	MARIE	We need to talk.
F	ELENA	So talk.
M	THEO	Somewhere private, maybe?
M	THEO	Who's this?
F	ELENA	Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out til morning.
F	MARIE	Let's just get this over with. You won. You got what you wanted...
F	ELENA	I just wanted justice...
M	THEO	Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the jury you faked the evidence, faked the tape...
F	ELENA	Really?
F	MARIE	We are prepared to make it worth your while.
F	ELENA	Not bad. But I always wanted a family...
M	THEO	They're yours after you exonerate my client.
F	ELENA	I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up front.
F	MARIE	No, that's not the deal.
F	ELENA	It is now. Take it or leave it.
M	THEO	When this is all over, you'll leave town. For good.
F	ELENA	I go more than five miles from the police station and I'm straight back in juvie...
M	THEO	I understand your Parole term is up next week.
F	ELENA	You've done your homework. Fine. As soon as this thing comes off, I'm outta here...
M	THEO	May I suggest a little discretion, Miss Sandoval. Certain...questions might be asked about this...arrangement if you were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High wearing a tiara...
F	ELENA	I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too much class for that shit.
F	MARIE	You're going to tell the truth on the stand tomorrow, yes?
F	ELENA	I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth...
M	THEO	It's your assertion that my client, Mr. Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you on the night of the 25th. Is that true?
M	THEO	Is that what you say happened?
F	ELENA	He... He didn't...
F	ELENA	....just sexually assault me.
M	THEO	What...did you just say?
F	ELENA	He didn't just sexually assault me. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone... T he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's
M	THEO	Isn't it true that you were inebriated during the assault, that it may not in fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone?
M	D.A. MEESE	Objection. Leading the witness.
M	JUDGE WILCOX	Sustained. Council will please rephrase the question.
F	ELENA	I was messed up, alright. In fact, only two things I remember. One was that bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that Goddamn video camera while he violated me. The other was what he whispered in my ear, right before I blacked out...
F	ELENA	He said, "You won't remember, but you'll never forget."
F	KRISTEN	What did she just say?
F	MARIE	Lying bitch!
M	ACTION NEWS ANCHOR	The young victim's wrenching testimonial proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Jay Clifford. It took less than an hour for the jury to deliberate and sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years. T V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs... You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU CAN'T!
F	MARIE	No such thing as can't...
F	MARIE	Who's there?
F	KRISTEN	Elena. Open up.
F	KRISTEN	Elena? Hello? S he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged
F	KRISTEN	Detective Morrison...
F	MARIE	Who invited you?
F	ELENA	Mother and Daughter...
F	MARIE	I was sure you'd blow it on the stand, going on about forgetting and remembering.
F	ELENA	Gotta make it seem authentic. God's in the details.
M	MORRISON	This couldn't wait 'til morning, Miss Richards?
F	KRISTEN	Call me Kristen...
M	MORRISON	The Feds just arrived to take over the Black Widow case, I'm up to my knees in paperwork... K RISTEN You remember what Elena said, right at the end of the trial. "You won't remember..."
M	MORRISON	"...but you'll never forget." What about it?
F	KRISTEN	Elena's fucking with us.
F	CHAD	Mind if Chad joins?
F	ELENA	Fuck me...
F	CHAD	Any time. Any place...
F	CHAD	Two beauties... Two beauties...
M	MORRISON	Just so you know, this is called 'breaking and entering'...
F	KRISTEN	I know all about it. Especially having something stolen...
M	MORRISON	Like what?
F	KRISTEN	Like my life... remember, but you'll never forget,' only thing victim remembers"
M	K	risten tears some of the articles off the wall.
F	KRISTEN	Once a thief, always a thief...
F	CHAD	Little blue pills. One of the perks of the job.
F	ELENA	You won't remember...
F	MARIE	But you'll never forget.
M	THEO	Mr. Clifford, this is Kristen Richards, Elena Sandoval's probation officer.
M	JAY	She want to pin me for some more crimes?
F	KRISTEN	No, Mr. Clifford. I just have a few questions. I've noticed some inconsistencies...
M	JAY	You've noticed some inconsistencies?
M	JAY	Here's one big fucking glaring inconsistency for you: I was set up!
F	KRISTEN	Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why were you set up? What would Elena Sandoval have gained from all this? up.
M	AY	What the hell. I'm already in jail. How much worse can it get? I paid her off, okay? My assets were tied up in the condos so we used Marie's diamonds. It wasn't like I had a choice. She had me by the short an' curlies, understand?
F	KRISTEN	But Elena's testimony was damning. Why wouldn't she play ball?
M	JAY	What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? How the fuck should I know? Manipulative little skank probably figured she could bleed me for some more money down the road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm gonna get those diamonds back, make her wish she was never born.
F	ELENA	Later potato... E LENA Oh shit...
F	MARIE	What the...If anyone sees us together...
F	ELENA	What choice did I have? We got big problems...
F	MARIE	Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's listening. Now what's the 411?
F	ELENA	I...I think I fucked up...
F	MARIE	How?
F	ELENA	I don't know for sure...but I think that bitch Parole officer's made me...she was at my trailer last night...
F	MARIE	No bigee. You disposed of everything, right? The teeth, the video, all the research...
F	ELENA	I did, but...She's got a hard on for me. Wants to see me back in Juvie...
F	MARIE	I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I promise.
F	ELENA	I just want outta here.
F	MARIE	Be patient. I'll call the Museum Curator, have him prepare the funds to buy back the diamonds...
F	ELENA	Then we're outta here, right?
F	MARIE	Just sit back, relax, enjoy the trip...Don't forget to come again.
M	T	heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets...
F	MARIE	Can I help you?
F	KRISTEN	I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time. Ask a couple questions.
F	MARIE	I'm in the middle of practice...
F	KRISTEN	It'll only take a moment, Marie. Might even help Jay. Remember your loving stepfather? You want to help him, don't you?
F	MARIE	Of course.
F	KRISTEN	Why'd you agree to part with your diamonds?
F	MARIE	How...
F	KRISTEN	Jay told me. But why? They were your inheritance.
F	MARIE	Jay needed help. We're a team.
F	KRISTEN	Team Clifford. Right. It's just...You must've been pretty unhappy when Jay didn't give you those diamonds for your birthday.
M	M	Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.
F	MARIE	He said I wasn't ready.
F	KRISTEN	You're 18. That's heiress payday, no? Must've crossed your mind that Jay might never let you have them...
F	MARIE	No, of course not.
F	KRISTEN	And then this little scam artist saunters in and just takes them. With your help, no less.
F	KRISTEN	But what I don't get is, why wouldn't Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name? After all, she'd gotten what she wanted.
F	MARIE	How should I know?
F	KRISTEN	I mean, the only way I can make sense of it is if somehow getting Jay released from prison would spoil the plan.
F	MARIE	What plan?
F	KRISTEN	You tell me... I
F	CHAD	Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something I can do for you?
F	KRISTEN	I was wondering if you'd do me the favor of running a quick test.
F	CHAD	Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me?
F	KRISTEN	Could you tell me what this is?
F	CHAD	No problemo. It'll only take a minute.
F	CHAD	Be careful, I got lots of evidence here.
F	KRISTEN	Are these the evidence photos from the Elena Sandoval rape?
F	CHAD	They are, but...
F	KRISTEN	Ever find out what caused these markings?
F	CHAD	Like I told the Judge, I guess they're finger nail markings...
F	KRISTEN	They don't look like finger nail markings to me. They look more like this...
F	KRISTEN	Would you say these markings are the same?
F	CHAD	W-where did you get that?
F	KRISTEN	Marie gave it to me. But you already knew that, didn't you, Doc?
F	CHAD	The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies.
F	KRISTEN	Been there. Done that.
F	MARIE	Hello?
F	MARIE	What the hell, Chad? Chad fidgets nervously.
F	CHAD	That parole officer was sniffin' around today.
F	MARIE	Not you too. She's just trying to prove her worthless excuse for an existence. She doesn't have a thing on us.
F	CHAD	Yeah, but she's askin' the right questions. It's only a matter of time. We gotta make our move.
F	MARIE	No. We stick to the plan. Give the Curator time to come up with the money...
F	CHAD	We gotta move fast, keep the heat off...
F	MARIE	You can't take the heat, get outta the kitchen.
F	CHAD	I wanna see 'em. The diamonds. Make sure they're safe. MARIE
F	CHAD	I just wanna see 'em. I thought we were
F	MARIE	You're gonna be the death of me... She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw. Removes a metallic CHAD Open it. I wanna see those puppies. Marie rolls her eyes, takes a key from a delicate chain around her
F	CHAD	I called the museum. The deal's goin' down tomorrow. 8 am...
F	MARIE	What did you... HAD I'm sorry, okay? But it's not like I had a choice.
F	ELENA	Yello...
F	MARIE	Chad fucked us.
M	ELENA (V.O.)	I know. I was there...
F	MARIE	No, I mean he really fucked us. He drugged me an' took the diamonds!
F	ELENA	ell me you're kidding...
M	MARIE (V.O.)	Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the diamonds!
M	MARIE (V.O.)	Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as it is.
F	ELENA	We've gotta stop him.
F	MARIE	He's heading to the museum, got himself an 8am meeting... He's gonna sell the diamonds...
F	MARIE	Not if we find him first...
M	C	had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him.
F	ELENA	Pull over!
F	ELENA	Give us back the diamonds!
F	CHAD	Us?
F	CHAD	FUCKING HELL!
F	ELENA	We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We just get the diamonds back...
F	MARIE	'm not gonna hurt him. No way...
F	MARIE	I'm gonna kill him.
F	ELENA	Marie! Don't do this...
F	ELENA	Marie!
M	MORRISON	You look like you could use a drink.
F	KRISTEN	When this is all over, I'd like that.
M	DAMMERS	More Black Widow leads. I need you to put them in the evidence locker, Morrison.
M	MORRISON	That's not my job, Agent Dammers.
M	DAMMERS	It is now.
F	ELENA	You okay?
F	MARIE	No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...
F	MARIE	He bolted... surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is...
F	MARIE	With the diamonds.
M	MORRISON	I appreciate the help...
F	KRISTEN	Right back at ya.
F	KRISTEN	You could have a helluva holiday on that money.
M	MORRISON	Recovered from the Black Widow's last score. If I'd gotten to the scene just five minutes earlier, I woulda gotten her as well...
F	KRISTEN	What the hell...
F	KRISTEN	Elena...
F	MARIE	Chad! There's nowhere to run to, you little weasel!
F	MARIE	Gotcha...
F	ELENA	This can't be happening...
F	MARIE	What now?
F	ELENA	I'm more than five miles away from the Police station. I go beyond five miles and the alarm goes off...
F	MARIE	You telling me your Parole Officer knows you're out here?
F	ELENA	She knows...
F	ELENA	Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or she'll find us here...
F	MARIE	You hear that?
F	MARIE	You go that way... E
F	ELENA	Please...
F	MARIE	You see him?
F	MARIE	Elena?
F	MARIE	Useless bitch...
F	CHAD	Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense you in the water, they'll rip you to pieces...
F	ELENA	Hel..help me... e hesitates, then reaches out to her. But stops short of grabbing
F	CHAD	No.
F	MARIE	What are you doing? Our diamonds are about to become dinner...
F	KRISTEN	Which way, which way... MARIE Get rid of the body. And his car...
F	ELENA	Where are you going?
F	MARIE	Where do you think?
F	ELENA	I don't...I don't have a clue...
F	MARIE	Chad made us an appointment to sell these. I'm gonna keep it...
F	ELENA	It's only a matter of time before my Parole Officer finds me...
F	MARIE	Then I suggest you get to work...
F	ELENA	Jesus...
M	CURATOR	Marie? Are you alright?
F	MARIE	Never better. Got the money?
M	CURATOR	I convinced the board of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding...
F	MARIE	Good.
M	S	he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...
M	CURATOR	I...I received a call from your 'associate'. He said he would be handling the transaction.
F	MARIE	Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied up at work. Completely swamped...
F	MARIE	Calm down. It's just blood.
F	ELENA	
F	ELENA	You gotta have a lighter or some...
F	ELENA	Jesus...
M	S	ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks
F	ELENA	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...
F	MARIE	So?
M	CURATOR	I...I'm not sure...
F	MARIE	Can you get the cash or not?
M	CURATOR	I can get the cash...it's just...
F	MARIE	Then let's have those dead presidents...
F	MARIE	What the hell are you doing?
M	CURATOR	One last test...
F	MARIE	NO!
F	KRISTEN	You okay?
F	KRISTEN	Care to explain?
F	ELENA	It was...it was an accident...
M	CURATOR	Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't believe they were our top attraction all these years...
F	MARIE	That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn Christmas ornaments...
M	CURATOR	Marie, please...
M	CURATOR	Marie, stop this instant!
F	MARIE	I hate you, Mom! I'm glad you're dead!
F	KRISTEN	I told you.
F	ELENA	Told me what?
F	KRISTEN	That if you were telling the truth I'd back you all the way. If you lied to me there'd be trouble...
F	ELENA	Chad swerved off the road, I swear...
F	KRISTEN	Just swerved for no reason. Just decided to take a shortcut through the swamp?
F	ELENA	It was an accident...
M	MORRISON	Accident my ass.
M	MORRISON	Forensics finds the head trauma that killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a single blow from behind. E lena looks up, through Panda eyes...
F	ELENA	The crash. He...he hit his head...
M	MORRISON	Was that before or after you dragged him through the swamp?
M	MORRISON	You got the right to remain silent, which in your case is probably best, cos of the shit you come up with...
F	KRISTEN	That's two strikes, Elena. One more and you're out.
F	ELENA	I'll do whatever you want.
F	KRISTEN	Yeah. Yeah you will.
F	ELENA	I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you what happened. She killed him, and took the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie Clifford...
M	MORRISON	Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the Judge. I think its time he heard the truth about Jay Clifford's accuser.
F	KRISTEN	Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be cleared, you know that. You need Marie, you need the proof they set him up...
F	KRISTEN	You came so close to nailing the Black Widow, don't let this slip through your fingers, Detective...
F	KRISTEN	Speak of the Devil...
F	KRISTEN	You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna say that everything went fine. No one found Chad's body. The plan's still on. Do you understand me?
M	MORRISON	You thinking what I'm thinking? K risten's patient with him.
F	KRISTEN	This is your chance. Feds can't take this one from you...
F	ELENA	Yello...
M	MARIE (ON PHONE)	The diamonds are fakes. Totally worthless.
M	ELENA (V.O.)	No. That can't be true!
F	MARIE	Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight. You can't...what about...me...
F	MARIE	Don't you understand? There's no money. Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I supposed to take care of your broke ass?
F	KRISTEN	Tell her she has to meet you. Tell her she can't leave...
F	ELENA	I...I gotta see you.
M	MARIE (V.O.)	I'll send you a photo.
F	ELENA	Please. Just one last time.
M	MARIE (V.O.)	I'm gone, gone, gonski.
F	ELENA	I think maybe...maybe there's a way we could still get some money...
F	MARIE	Okay, talk... Not over the phone. We gotta meet.
F	MARIE	School swimming pool. One hour.
F	KRISTEN	Where'd you keep the wire taps?
M	MORRISON	Evidence locker.
F	KRISTEN	Gimme the key. E
F	ELENA	Can you hear me? Is this thing working?
M	MORRISON	She's gonna blow it...
F	ELENA	I..don't think I can do this... It's already done.
F	MARIE	So?
F	ELENA	I had no choice...
F	MARIE	Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead. Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it out.
F	ELENA	Jay's got cash. At the building site. I saw it.
F	MARIE	That's your brilliant plan? It's in a safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have you got magic fingers, gonna pick that lock? I don't think so. Next.
M	E	We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we did. Like hell we are.
F	ELENA	Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him we'll come clean, tell the police everything, if he gives us the combination. I'm still a minor, they'll send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do that time standing on my head...
F	MARIE	How much money?
F	ELENA	Enough for you and me.
F	MARIE	We don't have to tell the cops anything. We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.
F	ELENA	But, we got rid of the real one...
F	MARIE	I kept a copy. Never trusted you backstabbers.
F	MARIE	You're trembling.
F	ELENA	Marie, I...
F	MARIE	Ssshhhh... B OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...
F	MARIE	Alright. Let's do it...
M	JAY	Well, well, well. Who'd have thought. What a pleasant surprise. I guess you guys have kissed and made up?
F	MARIE	Very funny. Did you know the diamonds were fakes?
M	JAY	Your Mom hocked them years ago. Boozed it all away. You already know the end of her sorry story...
M	JAY	So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
F	MARIE	We want money. Whatever you've got in your safe at the beach condos.
M	JAY	Of course you do. Of course you do.
F	ELENA	We'll get you out of here...
M	JAY	You will?
M	JAY	Is that what I think it is?
F	MARIE	You give us the combination and this goes in the nearest mail box, tied with a pretty pink bow.
M	JAY	How do I know it's the real tape?
F	MARIE	You're gonna have to trust us.
M	JAY	I've been down that road before.
F	MARIE	This is non-negotiable.
M	THEO	Sir, we have no grounds for appeal. This could be our only chance.
F	MARIE	What's the combination?
M	JAY	I can't...
F	MARIE	No such word as 'can't'... RISON GUARD Time's up, Mr. Clifford.
M	JAY	Fine. 08-20-99.
F	MARIE	The combination's the day Mom died, you sick fuck?
F	ELENA	Slow down!
F	ELENA	We're in a world of shit!
F	ELENA	We'll never get away with this. You know that don't you?
F	KRISTEN	Come on, Elena...Keep pushing...
F	MARIE	One down...
M	ELENA (V.O.)	Marie! Please, I can't do this...
F	MARIE	Two down.
F	ELENA	I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it to the police.
F	ELENA	I'll tell 'em you made me lie about your stepfather raping me, made me perjure myself on the stand, went and killed Chad, and now...
F	MARIE	99. A very good year...
M	MORRISON	This has gotta end.
F	KRISTEN	It's gonna end. One way or another...
F	MARIE	Money. Always in style.
F	ELENA	Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?
F	ELENA	You killed him, Marie. You murdered him in cold blood... S he rips the microphone from Elena's chest. Stands there with the
F	KRISTEN	She's been made...
M	MORRISON	Stay here...
F	KRISTEN	I got us into this...
M	MORRISON	Just stay in the car! Please...
F	MARIE	You stupid fucking Sherbert. You think you could sell me out?
F	ELENA	They made me do it...
F	MARIE	Morrison doesn't know his prick from a pogo stick. And that bitch Parole Officer, she hasn't got the balls for this...
F	ELENA	Please, don't...
M	MORRISON	Sweeps through the second floor, meticulously checking every KRISTEN Runs towards the unfinished building, looking up to the UV glow on
M	MORRISON	Enters the third floor from the fire escape, continues his KRISTEN hick plumes of blood, black under the UV light, stain the walls
F	KRISTEN	I didn't have a choice. She was gonna kill Elena.
M	MORRISON	It's gonna be okay.
M	PARAMEDIC	We found this on the body.
M	KRISTEN (O.S.)	Just got off the phone with the Parole board...
F	KRISTEN	They want me to bring Elena back to Miami in the morning.
F	KRISTEN	I'm... sorry for this whole mess.
M	MORRISON	Don't be. It was my gun that fired the shots, so it must've been me who pulled the trigger. I'll take the credit on this one. After all the Black widow crap I had to put up with, I've earnt it...
F	KRISTEN	You did the right thing...
M	MORRISON	We did the right thing. K RISTEN You call me, promise?
M	MORRISON	I will. I will.
F	KRISTEN	Now that this is all over, maybe we can have that drink soon...
M	MORRISON	How you holdin' up, Jay?
M	JAY	Been better.
M	MORRISON	So what's next?
M	JAY	No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed. Guess there's nowhere to go but up.
M	MORRISON	I can't help but feel partially responsible. If there's anything I...
M	JAY	I don't think so, but thanks.
M	MORRISON	Can I at least give you a ride somewhere?
M	JAY	Ain't got nowhere to go...
M	MORRISON	... but up, right?
M	MORRISON	Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't heard from you. Hope you're doing okay. Everything's fine here. Haven't been any questions asked that I can't answer, an' no one's brought your name up. So give me a call back and maybe we can go for that drink... H e's cut off by...
M	RECORDED VOICE	BEEP. The mail box you are trying to reach is full. Your message has been deleted.
M	OFFICER ENTWISTLE	You better come with me, Detective.
M	AGENT DAMMERS	Detective Morrison. So good to finally see you.
M	MORRISON	What the hell, Dammers?
M	AGENT DAMMERS	I should be asking you the same question.
M	MORRISON	It's...gone.
M	DAMMERS	That's right, Morrison. Every last bit of evidence from the Black Widow case. Not to mention the money you confiscated. All $427,000. MORRISON But how...
M	DAMMERS	I was hoping you'd be able to answer that question.
M	MORRISON	What in God's name are you talking about? I didn't have anything to do with it!
M	DAMMERS	Well, your key card was the last one that opened this locker.
M	MORRISON	Holy shit. Kristen...
M	PRETTY RECEPTIONIST	D ade County Parole. How can I direct your call?
M	MORRISON	This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay PD. I was wondering if you had a forwarding number for Kristen Richards...
M	PRETTY RECEPTIONIST(V.O.)	Who?
M	MORRISON	Kristen Richards. She's one of your officers. Has cases up here in Blue Bay.
M	PRETTY RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry, Detective. There's no one here by that name.
M	MORRISON	No, of course there is. I worked with her personally. I...
M	PRETTY RECEPTIONIST	I have no record of a Kristen Richards ever working here. Besides, Blue Bay's out of our jurisdiction...
M	MORRISON	Oh no. No, no, no...
F	KRISTEN	I can't believe Morrison just handed me the key to the evidence locker...
M	T	he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.
F	KRISTEN	These are...genuine?
F	ELENA	Nothin' like the real thing. Switched 'em for the fakes right after Marie tried to pay me off...
F	KRISTEN	They're...So beautiful.
F	ELENA	The mother.
F	KRISTEN	The daughter.
M	MORRISON	She was the Black Widow. Her and that little...
M	MORRISON	Played me like a fool.
M	DAMMERS	Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard on yourself, Morrison... That's my job.
M	MORRISON	You smug son of a bitch. It's not like you knew who she was anymore than I did.
M	DAMMERS	That's the God's honest truth. But at least I didn't give her my evidence locker keycard. And I didn't lie about who fired the shots that killed the Clifford kid.
M	MR. BARAJAS	Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer!
M	MORRISON	What did you say?
M	CICATRIZ	The foundation is sinking. The entire site is a sink hole. It's completely worthless.
M	MR. BARAJAS	I'm going to kill Jay Clifford...
M	MORRISON	You and me both...
M	JAY (O.S.)	Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do that to a friend. Especially one going through such a nasty divorce.
M	JAY	Told me he'd never trust another woman as long as he lived. And then along came a spider...
F	KRISTEN	A black widow. little taken aback when you wanted to snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over
F	ELENA	You want me to top you off?
M	JAY	That'd be fine, just fine.
M	JAY	She's got a good head on her shoulders.
M	JAY	You two got me out of a mountain of shit, I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you played it perfectly.
F	KRISTEN	My job was easy. It was Elena who had to keep it all together... We've had some practice along the way...
F	ELENA	Here you go, Mr. Clifford.
M	JAY	Well, all that nasty business, it's behind us. Forever. From here on out, it's the good life.
M	JAY	You two look so good, it's difficult to tell which one's the mother and which one's the daughter...
F	KRISTEN	That's just the roofies talking...
M	JAY	What did you say?
F	KRISTEN	Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party. I'd never really tasted cocktails like that.
M	JAY	I don't...whattya talking about?
F	KRISTEN	It was like being awake though an operation. I could feel everything happening, but I couldn't do anything to stop it...
M	JAY	Oh...shit...
F	KRISTEN	You took something from me that night. But you left something behind...
F	KRISTEN	Your daughter...
M	JAY	I don't remember...
M	E	lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him.
F	KRISTEN	You may not remember...
F	ELENA	...But you'll never forget.
F	ELENA	Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.
F	KRISTEN	Let's go get our money.
M	KRISTEN (V.O.)	We got problems...
F	ELENA	Almost done here. Leave it. Come on!
M	KRISTEN (V.O.)	He gonna be able to make an ID?
F	ELENA	Not on your life. I gave him enough roofies to make an elephant forget.
F	ELENA	I can't believe we just gave up all that cash.
F	KRISTEN	Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got an angle on our real prey.
F	ELENA	We goin' to Blue Bay?
F	KRISTEN	He won't know what hit him.
F	ELENA	'bout time...
M	KRISTEN (O.S.)	That's an awful lot of money...
M	JAY	Who the hell...
F	KRISTEN	Not enough though. Gonna need those Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this disaster...
M	JAY	What? What the hell do you mean?
M	B	Jay...
F	KRISTEN	The building's built on a sink hole, Jay. You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans off your back...
M	JAY	How'd you...how'd you know all this...
F	KRISTEN	It's what we do.
M	JAY	We?
F	MARIE	I just want what's mine...
F	ELENA	The diamonds are your inheritance. You deserve them...
F	MARIE	My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me the Goddamn key...
F	ELENA	So you take it, one way or another...
F	MARIE	You take a check?
F	CHAD	Money talks, bullshit walks. I got strippers to feed...
F	MARIE	How'd you like to make some real cash?
F	CHAD	Chad likes the sound of that.
F	ELENA	Hey, that hurt!
F	MARIE	Shut it, bitch. No pain, no gain...
F	CHAD	We'll put you right here, and... C'mon now baby, you can do it...
F	ELENA	Will you knock that off? They're gone.
F	KRISTEN	You're blocking our sun...
M	UNCLE MARTY	Ladies. Hellova job back there. Your best ever if I might be so bold...
F	KRISTEN	This is our biggest score. You sure you can move it?
M	UNCLE MARTY	Not a problem.
F	KRISTEN	Let's see the green...
M	UNCLE MARTY	Got another lead, if you're interested. Was just up in Boston, surveying a mansion that's just been sold. Termites already eaten most of it. Owner's shitting bricks. There's gotta be an angle for the Black Widows...
F	KRISTEN	It's over. We had a good run.
M	UNCLE MARTY	Shame. Guess all good things come to an end. So, the diamonds...
M	UNCLE MARTY	How do I know these are the real thing?
F	ELENA	You're going to have to trust us...
