M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	JACKIE	Flight 710 Cabo San Lucas, now boarding Gate 12, first class only.
F	SIDNEY	Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9. The popular TEC-9 is advertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest customer.
M	BLACK MAN (O.S.)	That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass spray gun outta South Miami.
M	BLACK VOICE	Cost three-eighty retail. I get them for two hundred and sell 'em for eight.
F	ORDELL	This TEC-9? They advertise it as being the most popular gun in American crime. Can you believe that shit? It actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it. "Most Popular Gun in American Crime," like they're proud of that shit.
F	ORDELL	Check out this body-builder chick... Now see what she got. That's a Styer Aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen.
F	ORDELL	Shit's expensive, man. Comes from Austria. My customers don't know shit about it, so there ain't no demand. Baby, I could use some more ice.
F	ORDELL	But put that bad boy in a flick, every motherfucker out there want one. I'm serious as a heart attack. Them Hong Kong movies came out, every nigga gotta have a forty-five. And they don't want one, they want two, cause nigga want to be "The Killer." What they don't know, and that movie don't tell you is a .45 has a serious fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try and steer a customer towards a 9- millimeter. Damn near the same weapon, don't have half the jammin' problems. But some niggas out there, you can't tell them anything. They want a .45. The killer had a .45, they want a
F	ORDELL	Thanks, Baby.
M	LOUIS	Who's your partner?
F	ORDELL	Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to him, gets it to my customers. On all my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now, motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He got himself a yacht, with all kinds of high tech navigational shit on it. AK-47, the very best there is.
F	ORDELL	When you absolutely, positively, gotta kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitute. That there is the Chinese one. I pay eight- fifty and double my money.
F	ORDELL	Get that for me, will ya baby?
F	MELANIE	You know it's for you.
F	ORDELL	Girl, you better not make me go over there and put my feet to ya.
F	MELANIE	Hello.
F	MELANIE	It's for you.
F	ORDELL	Yeah. Hey, Junebug, what's up?
F	MELANIE	It's boring, isn't it?
M	LOUIS	I can sit through it once.
F	MELANIE	He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
M	LOUIS	I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
F	MELANIE	He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
F	MELANIE	Want a hit?
M	LOUIS	Sure.
F	MELANIE	When did you get out of jail?
M	LOUIS	Four days ago.
F	MELANIE	Where at?
M	LOUIS	Susanville.
F	MELANIE	How long?
M	LOUIS	Two months shy of four years.
F	MELANIE	Four years?
M	LOUIS	Uh-huh.
F	MELANIE	What for?
M	LOUIS	Bank robbery.
F	MELANIE	Really, I'm impressed.
F	MELANIE	Four years that's a long fuckin time.
F	ORDELL	See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
M	LOUIS	What's your cost?
F	ORDELL	As low as two.
M	LOUIS	Are you serious?
F	ORDELL	That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
F	ORDELL	I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
M	LOUIS	That's good money.
F	ORDELL	Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
M	LOUIS	Then what?
F	ORDELL	I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
F	ORDELL	Who is it?
F	MELANIE	It's Beaumont.
F	ORDELL	Beaumont -- Ordell. What's the problem? What the fuck you doin' in jail? What the fuck you doin' that for? Ain't you got better sense than to be drivin' drunk carrying a goddam pistol?
F	ORDELL	Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me. Number one, you need to chill out, nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit ain't as bad as you think it is. Course you're scared. That's what these motherfuckers get paid for scarin' the shit outta ya. That's their job. And my job is to get you the fuck home so let me tell you what is gonna happen... May I speak?... Thank you... You gonna spend the night in jail; it's too late to get you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna take you into court. I'm gonna be there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll be back home, I promise. So just calm your ass down, and I'll see you tomorrow. You owe me a helluva lot more than one, nigga. See you.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	...the judge doesn't give a fuck about that. He's ready to habitualize you. Is that what you want -- you wanna look at ten years?
M	MAX	Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll get you out, I promise. But it means I gotta pick you up tonight.
M	MAX	Reggie, there ain't no two ways about it. You're spending the night in jail, but I already told you I'll get you out tomorrow. Now where are you? You're at your mother's house, aren't you?
M	MAX	Okay. Just stay put till I come for you. Reggie, do yourself a really big favor and be there when I get there.
M	MAX	How can I help you?
F	ORDELL	Where would you like me to put my ash?
M	MAX	Use that coffee cup on the desk.
F	ORDELL	And I need me a bond for ten thousand.
F	ORDELL	Oh, that's just my white friend, Louis. He's got nothing to do with my business. We just hangin together. We're on our way to a cocktail lounge.
F	ORDELL	Who's that big Mandingo nigga you gotcha arm around?
M	MAX	That's Winston. He works here.
F	ORDELL	He's a big one. You two tight?
M	MAX	Yeah.
F	ORDELL	It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
M	MAX	So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
F	ORDELL	Gonna have to put up cash.
M	MAX	You have it with you?
F	ORDELL	It's in my bag. You have cash. What do you need me for?
F	ORDELL	C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
M	MAX	Cost you a thousand for the bond.
F	ORDELL	I know that.
M	MAX	Who's it for? A relative?
F	ORDELL	Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
M	MAX	Ten thousand sounds high.
F	ORDELL	They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
M	MAX	He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
F	ORDELL	You think you could do that?
M	MAX	I've done it.
M	MAX	What's his full name?
F	ORDELL	Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
M	MAX	Records office.
M	MAX	Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this? Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to look up the booking card and rough arrest on a defendant named Beaumont. That's all I have. I believe it's a surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.
M	LOUIS	I'm going to wait in the car.
F	ORDELL	Sure. We almost done, ain't we?
M	MAX	Getting there.
F	ORDELL	You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
F	ORDELL	Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
M	LOUIS	Which one is for the car?
F	ORDELL	This one's for the ignition... ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
M	LOUIS	What do I do?
F	ORDELL	You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
M	LOUIS	Okay.
F	ORDELL	Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
M	MAX	Beaumont Livingston.
F	ORDELL	Livingston, huh?
M	MAX	On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
F	ORDELL	You don't say.
M	MAX	Do you know what he's on probation for?
F	ORDELL	Haven't a clue.
M	MAX	Possession of unregistered machine guns.
F	ORDELL	Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
M	MAX	They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
F	ORDELL	Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
M	MAX	I need your name and address.
F	ORDELL	Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton
M	MAX	House or apartment?
F	ORDELL	House.
M	MAX	Now I need you to count your money.
F	ORDELL	Hope you don't mind me askin' where you keepin' my money till I get it back. In your drawer?
M	MAX	Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
F	ORDELL	Beaumont ain't going nowhere. Where do I sign?
F	ORDELL	Hey, Max.
M	MAX	Yes.
F	ORDELL	I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies. I get my money back, don't I?
M	BEAUMONT	Who is it?
F	ORDELL	It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me up.
F	ORDELL	Look at you and your free ass. Come over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.
M	BEAUMONT	What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
F	ORDELL	Who was there for your ass?
M	BEAUMONT	You were there for me.
F	ORDELL	Who?
M	BEAUMONT	You.
F	ORDELL	You goddam right!
F	ORDELL	You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
M	BEAUMONT	I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
F	ORDELL	Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
M	BEAUMONT	If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
F	ORDELL	How old is that machine gun shit?
M	BEAUMONT	Three years.
F	ORDELL	Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
M	BEAUMONT	That's not what they're tellin' me.
F	ORDELL	That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
F	ORDELL	Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let me tell you a little bit about my lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my own private Johnie Cochran. In fact, he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And like Johnie Cochran, dude hates fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man lives to fuck with the police. So as a favor, I had him look at your case. Stacin told me you ain't got shit to worry about. They just fuckin' wit ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on their ass, make 'em -- ...Stop fuckin' wit ya!
M	BEAUMONT	Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
F	ORDELL	Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
M	BEAUMONT	What'd ya mean?
F	ORDELL	Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
M	BEAUMONT	What?
F	ORDELL	I need a favor.
M	BEAUMONT	That requires me goin' out tonight?
F	ORDELL	A bit.
M	BEAUMONT	Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
F	ORDELL	Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
M	BEAUMONT	What's the problem?
F	ORDELL	Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
M	BEAUMONT	Uh-huh.
F	ORDELL	I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
M	BEAUMONT	Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
F	ORDELL	Let me finish. Can I finish?
M	BEAUMONT	Go ahead.
F	ORDELL	Now you're gonn be in the trunk holding onto the shotgun.
M	BEAUMONT	Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
F	ORDELL	What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
M	BEAUMONT	I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
F	ORDELL	We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
M	BEAUMONT	Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
F	ORDELL	You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
M	BEAUMONT	Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
F	ORDELL	I can't believe you do me this way.
M	BEAUMONT	I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
F	ORDELL	Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
M	BEAUMONT	Look, man, I know I owe you --
F	ORDELL	Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
M	BEAUMONT	I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
F	ORDELL	You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
F	ORDELL	Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
M	BEAUMONT	Course you didn't.
F	ORDELL	But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
F	ORDELL	Just think, man. That 'scoe's special, smothered in gravy and onions. Get a side of red beans and rice. Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
M	BEAUMONT	Now exactly how long I gotta be in this motherfucker.
F	ORDELL	Don't worry. It's just me.
F	ORDELL	I was wondering. Did any federal people come visit you in jail and I should be watching my ass?
F	ORDELL	You wouldn't tell me if they did and I wouldn't blame you.
M	LOUIS	Hello.
F	ORDELL	Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
M	LOUIS	Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
F	ORDELL	Whatcha watchin'?
M	LOUIS	Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
F	ORDELL	Guess where I am?
M	LOUIS	I dunno.
F	ORDELL	I know you don't know. I said guess.
M	LOUIS	The moon -- I dunno
F	ORDELL	I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
M	LOUIS	You're outside?
F	ORDELL	Uh-huh.
M	LOUIS	C'mon in.
F	ORDELL	Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
M	LOUIS	I'm in my underwear.
F	ORDELL	Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
F	ORDELL	You know what your problem is, Louis?
F	ORDELL	You think you're a good guy. When you go into a deal you don't go in prepared to take that motherfucker all the way. You go in looking for a way out. And it ain't cause you're scared neither. It's cause you think you're a good guy, and you think there's certain things a good guy won't do. That's where we're different, me and you. Cause me, once I decide I want something, ain't a goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun. Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get removed. Understand what I'm saying?
M	LOUIS	Who was that?
F	ORDELL	That was Beaumont.
M	LOUIS	Who was Beaumont?
F	ORDELL	An employee I had to let go.
M	LOUIS	What did he do?
F	ORDELL	He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did. And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em. Understand what I'm sayin'?
M	LOUIS	Yeah.
F	ORDELL	So we on the same page then?
M	LOUIS	I follow.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Miss Brown.
M	DARGUS	Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
F	JACKIE	The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
M	NICOLET	Can I be of some assistance?
F	JACKIE	I doubt it. Who's your friend?
M	DARGUS	This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
F	JACKIE	Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
M	DARGUS	You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
F	JACKIE	Suspicion of what?
M	NICOLET	All he wants to do is peek in your bag. I'll watch he doesn't take anything.
F	JACKIE	Go ahead.
M	DARGUS	I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
M	NICOLET	That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
M	DARGUS	This is your money?
F	JACKIE	If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
M	DARGUS	You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
F	JACKIE	I'm not saying another word.
M	NICOLET	Listen, Jackie, hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch of fuckin' pricks in Customs. Something about that job makes them kinda hard to get along with. Now, do you want to talk with a bunch of suspicious, disagreeable people like them, or a couple good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.
M	DARGUS (O.S.)	Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
F	JACKIE	Arrest me. We could, smart ass... or we could work out what's known as a Substantial Assistance Agreement. That is if you're willing to cooperate. Tell us who gave you the money and who you're giving it to.
M	NICOLET (O.S.)	You got a good lawyer?
M	DARGUS (O.S.)	Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
M	NICOLET (O.S.)	Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
M	NICOLET	Don't know Beaumont? That's funny 'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he did know you, Beaumont was found in the trunk of a car -- dead. Shot twice. Once in the head and once in the chest.
M	NICOLET	I had the chance to talk to Beaumont yesterday. You see, like you, Beaumont found himself in some hot water. He was looking at ten years he was pretty sure he didn't want to do and was understandably concerned. Now maybe you don't know Beaumont, but Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does the guy who blew Beaumont's head off. If you don't want to talk to us, I guess we'll just have to hand you over to Customs.
F	JACKIE	Okay, let's go.
M	DARGUS	You know, Miss Brown, there's basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE. Victims, witnesses, innocent bystanders... You ain't any of these. Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law. That ain't you either. Where you belong is the third category. The category we refer to as LOSERS.
F	JACKIE	I'm not a loser.
M	DARGUS	Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
M	NICOLET	You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here, he wouldn't say. Could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to?
M	DARGUS	I'd like your permission to open this again. So we'll know exactly how much money we're talkin' about here.
F	JACKIE	Help yourself.
M	DARGUS	While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
F	JACKIE	My pocketbook.
M	DARGUS	What's in it?
F	JACKIE	Beauty products.
M	NICOLET	I'll count the money.
M	DARGUS	What's this?
F	JACKIE	That's my diet shit.
M	DARGUS	Let's see what else is in there.
M	NICOLET	Oh, Miss Brown?
F	JACKIE	Yeah?
M	NICOLET	And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
F	JACKIE	What the fuck is that shit?
M	NICOLET	I know what it looks like.
F	JACKIE	You planted that shit on me.
F	JACKIE	Look, that shit ain't mine.
M	NICOLET	It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
M	DARGUS	Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
F	JACKIE	I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
M	NICOLET	Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you have a seat and tell us who might know something about this fuckin' shit.
M	DARGUS	If she'll cooperate with us, we'll turn possession with intent into plain ol' Possession, and she can bond outta here for one thousand bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll go for the Intent and request a twenty- five-thousand dollar bond.
F	JACKIE	You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
M	PUBLIC DEFENDER	Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
F	JACKIE	Who's side are you on?
M	PUBLIC DEFENDER	I beg your pardon?
F	JACKIE	What if I plead guilty?
M	PUBLIC DEFENDER	And cooperate? You might get probation.
F	JACKIE	If I don't cooperate?
M	PUBLIC DEFENDER	With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
M	JUDGE	Brown. Case number 700324.
M	JUDGE	The charge is possession of Narcotics with the Intent to Distribute. How does your client plead?
M	PUBLIC DEFENDER	She wishes to stand mute, your honor.
M	JUDGE	Very well... ...Detective Dargus -- You're the arresting officer in his case, correct?
M	DARGUS	That's correct, your honor.
M	JUDGE	You have a recommendation for bail?
M	DARGUS	Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the defendant's prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation, the State requests a bond of no less than twenty-five thousand.
M	JUDGE	I'll set bond at ten thousand and set the date of August 14th for the arraignment.
F	JACKIE	When is that, your honor?
M	JUDGE	That's six weeks from now, Miss Brown. We'll continue this matter then. Owens, case 72242.
F	ORDELL	Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you wash your hands.
M	MAX	Comfortable?
F	ORDELL	The door was opened, so I just came right in.
M	MAX	I can see that. Why?
F	ORDELL	I got some more business for ya.
M	MAX	Oh, yeah? What did he do? She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
M	MAX	The bond for possession is only a thousand.
F	ORDELL	They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
M	MAX	It still sounds high.
F	ORDELL	She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
M	MAX	Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
F	ORDELL	Somebody already did.
M	MAX	What?
F	ORDELL	You didn't hear?
M	MAX	Hear what?
F	ORDELL	Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
M	MAX	Did the police contact you?
F	ORDELL	Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
M	MAX	The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
F	ORDELL	Brown, Jackie Brown.
M	MAX	What does she do for you?
F	ORDELL	Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
M	MAX	Beaumont worked for you.
F	ORDELL	That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
M	MAX	Was she?
F	ORDELL	Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
M	MAX	You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out. If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
M	MAX	Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
F	ORDELL	Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
M	MAX	You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
F	ORDELL	Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
M	MAX	I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
F	ORDELL	I got it. I just don't got it on me.
M	MAX	Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
F	ORDELL	Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
M	MAX	If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
F	ORDELL	little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
M	MAX	Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
F	ORDELL	Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
M	MAX	Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
F	ORDELL	Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with. Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
F	ORDELL	Okay, man. I got your money. But don't you ever ask me for no fuckin' favor.
M	MAX	Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
F	ANITA	I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
M	MAX	But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
F	ANITA	I know. That's why I went.
M	MAX	But then you told her you were home.
F	ANITA	Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
M	MAX	I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
F	ANITA	I understand.
M	MAX	I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
F	ANITA	I understand.
M	MAX	Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
F	ANITA	Yes, Max, I understand.
M	MAX	Dropping off and picking up. Dropping off Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown, Jackie.
F	ANITA	So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
M	MAX	I'll call her.
F	ANITA	Won't forget?
M	MAX	I won't forget.
F	ANITA	Thanks, Max. See you later.
M	SHERIFF (O.S.)	Max! Here she comes.
M	MAX	Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman.
M	MAX	I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
F	JACKIE	Okay.
F	JACKIE	Are you really a bail bondsman?
M	MAX	Who do you think I am?
M	MAX	I gave you my card there.
F	JACKIE	Can I see your I.D.?
M	MAX	You're serious?
F	JACKIE	Who put up my bond? Ordell?
M	MAX	In cash.
F	JACKIE	Can we stop for cigarettes?
M	MAX	Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
F	JACKIE	I don't think so.
M	MAX	It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
F	JACKIE	Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
M	MAX	I thought you might want a drink?
F	JACKIE	I'd love one, but not there.
M	MAX	We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
F	JACKIE	Is it dark?
M	MAX	It's kind of a sports bar
F	JACKIE	That doesn't sound dark.
M	MAX	Why does it need to be dark?
F	JACKIE	'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
M	MAX	Great.
M	MAX	No thanks, I quit three years ago.
F	JACKIE	You gain weight?
M	MAX	Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
F	JACKIE	That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
M	MAX	What's your brand?
F	JACKIE	Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
M	MAX	Was she helpful?
F	JACKIE	She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
M	MAX	You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
F	JACKIE	You're not tired of it?
M	MAX	I am, as a matter of fact.
M	MAX	What have they told you?
F	JACKIE	So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
M	MAX	I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
F	JACKIE	Shit.
M	MAX	But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?
F	JACKIE	Sure.
M	MAX	You know who put the dope in your bag?
F	JACKIE	Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
M	MAX	They wanted you to tell them what you know.
F	JACKIE	I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
M	MAX	What did they want to know?
F	JACKIE	Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
M	ROWEN	Can I get you two some popcorn?
M	MAX	No, thanks.
M	MAX	That would be Beaumont Livingston.
F	JACKIE	That's him. How do you know 'em?
M	MAX	I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
F	JACKIE	Ordell pick up his bond?
M	MAX	Same as you. Ten thousand.
F	JACKIE	The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
M	MAX	You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
F	JACKIE	I didn't?
M	MAX	No, you didn't. What branch?
F	JACKIE	Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
M	MAX	He's the one who wants you.
F	JACKIE	It was the other guy who busted me.
M	MAX	'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
F	JACKIE	I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
F	JACKIE	I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
M	MAX	How many trips did you make?
F	JACKIE	With ten thousand? Nine.
M	MAX	He's got that kinda money?
F	JACKIE	It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
M	MAX	Cash poor?
F	JACKIE	That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
M	MAX	If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
F	JACKIE	Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
M	MAX	Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
F	JACKIE	Yeah, if I cooperate.
M	MAX	Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
F	JACKIE	But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
M	MAX	Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
M	MAX	What'dya think?
F	JACKIE	I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
F	ORDELL	How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
F	JACKIE	I was expecting you. Come in.
F	ORDELL	You got some booze?
F	JACKIE	I got some vodka in the freezer.
F	ORDELL	Got some o.j.?
F	JACKIE	Yeah.
F	ORDELL	Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
F	JACKIE	Sure.
F	ORDELL	You gonna thank me?
F	JACKIE	For what?
F	ORDELL	Who you think got your ass outta jail?
F	JACKIE	The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
F	ORDELL	Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
F	JACKIE	It wasn't mine.
F	ORDELL	Oh, shit. I bet it was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie. Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in there if you didn't. Oh, man, that shit's uncalled for, baby, and I apologize. I 'magine they asked you a shitload of questions about it, huh? All that money, want to know where you got it?
F	ORDELL	I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
F	JACKIE	They asked.
F	ORDELL	And what was your answer?
F	JACKIE	I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
F	ORDELL	You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
F	JACKIE	You're not asking the right questions.
F	JACKIE	Beaumont Livingston.
F	ORDELL	I knew it.
F	JACKIE	And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
F	ORDELL	Yeah?
F	JACKIE	I didn't tell 'em anything.
F	ORDELL	My name come up?
F	ORDELL	You say anything about me?
F	ORDELL	Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
F	ORDELL	This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
F	JACKIE	They told me.
F	ORDELL	Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont. Or they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin' some time. I'magine from time-to- time they asked you a whole shitload of questions. And you didn't give 'em no answer?
F	ORDELL	You scared of me?
F	ORDELL	You got a reason to be nervous with me?
M	MAX	Where is it?
F	ORDELL	Is that what I think it is?
F	JACKIE	What do you think it is?
F	ORDELL	I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
F	JACKIE	You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
F	ORDELL	What the hell you doin'?
F	JACKIE	Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
F	ORDELL	Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
F	JACKIE	The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
F	ORDELL	Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
F	JACKIE	Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
F	ORDELL	Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
F	JACKIE	I said, you understand what I'm saying
F	ORDELL	I understand woman, damn!
F	JACKIE	Go sit over in that chair.
F	ORDELL	I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
F	JACKIE	Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
F	JACKIE	Put both hands behind your head.
F	ORDELL	This shit's gettin' silly now...
F	JACKIE	I gotta tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.
F	ORDELL	I just came here to talk.
F	JACKIE	Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
F	ORDELL	Well, I can get you a good lawyer --
F	JACKIE	Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
F	ORDELL	Baby, I didn't --
F	JACKIE	It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
F	ORDELL	Yeah?
F	JACKIE	One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
F	ORDELL	I got a problem...
F	JACKIE	All your money's in Mexico.
F	ORDELL	Yeah.
F	JACKIE	I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
F	JACKIE	I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on. Talk to you tomorrow.
F	JACKIE	You want your gun, don't you? Come in. I'll go get it.
F	JACKIE	Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I asked to borrow it you'd say no. You'd have to. Would you like some coffee?
M	MAX	If you're having some.
F	JACKIE	I am. Have a seat.
M	MAX	You get a chance to use it?
F	JACKIE	I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
M	MAX	Black's fine.
M	MAX	You want to hang on to it awhile? It wouldn't be legal, but if it makes --
F	JACKIE	Thanks, but I have my own now.
M	MAX	You went out this morning and bought a gun?
F	JACKIE	What, I couldn't hear you?
M	MAX	You went out this morning and bought a gun.
F	JACKIE	Let's just say I got one, okay?
M	MAX	Somebody loan it to you?
F	JACKIE	Yeah.
F	JACKIE	Want to hear some music?
M	MAX	Sure.
F	JACKIE	I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
M	MAX	It looks nice.
M	MAX	You never got into the whole CD revolution?
F	JACKIE	I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
M	MAX	Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on records.
F	JACKIE	I don't buy new stuff that often.
M	MAX	This is pretty.
F	JACKIE	Uh-huh.
M	MAX	Who is this?
F	JACKIE	The Delfonics.
M	MAX	
F	JACKIE	'74, I think.
M	MAX	It's nice.
F	JACKIE	I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
M	MAX	Are you?
F	JACKIE	I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
M	MAX	What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
F	JACKIE	I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
M	MAX	Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
F	JACKIE	It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
M	MAX	How'd you find that out?
F	JACKIE	He told me last night.
M	MAX	He called you?
F	JACKIE	He came by.
M	MAX	What?... What'd you do?
F	JACKIE	We talked.
F	JACKIE	He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
M	MAX	Why?
F	JACKIE	He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
M	MAX	No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
F	JACKIE	Maybe, but I'm the only one he's ever used. He can't trust his other people. They're crooks. He can try bringing it in himself, but Ordell sure don't want to go through no Customs line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess, or he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can.
M	MAX	How do you get it out?
F	JACKIE	Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
M	MAX	You're gonna offer to set him up?
F	JACKIE	If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
M	MAX	It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
F	JACKIE	I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
F	JACKIE	How do you feel about getting old?
M	MAX	You're not old. You look great.
F	JACKIE	I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
M	MAX	It's not really something I think about.
F	JACKIE	Really?
M	MAX	Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
F	JACKIE	How'd you feel about it?
M	MAX	I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
F	JACKIE	It's different with men.
M	MAX	You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
M	MAX	In fact, I'd make a bet that except possibly for an Afro --- you look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine.
F	JACKIE	My ass ain't the same.
M	MAX	Bigger?
F	JACKIE	Yeah.
M	MAX	Nothin wrong with that.
M	MAX	Does something else worry you?
F	JACKIE	I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
M	MAX	Fifteen thousand.
F	JACKIE	Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
M	DARGUS (O.S.)	Come in.
M	DARGUS	Great, you're here.
M	NICOLET	Hey, Jackie.
M	DARGUS	Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
F	JACKIE	Take your time.
M	DARGUS	Thanks.
M	NICOLET	We'll just be a minute.
F	JACKIE	Can I smoke?
M	DARGUS	Go ahead.
M	NICOLET	What's going on?
M	DARGUS	She wants to make a deal.
M	NICOLET	She sound scared?
M	DARGUS	She almost sounds scared.
M	NICOLET	What's she want?
M	DARGUS	She wants to go back to work.
M	NICOLET	What's she willing to give us?
M	DARGUS	She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
M	NICOLET	She knows it's my case?
M	DARGUS	She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
M	NICOLET	Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
F	JACKIE	I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
M	NICOLET	We can look into that.
F	JACKIE	I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
M	NICOLET	You know what we want.
F	JACKIE	If I'm working, I can help you.
M	DARGUS	Help us do what?
F	JACKIE	Help you get Ordell Robbie.
M	NICOLET	Oh, so now you know him?
F	JACKIE	You never asked me if I did or not.
M	DARGUS	But now you're telling us now you do.
F	JACKIE	'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
M	NICOLET	No shit. You know how he makes his money?
F	JACKIE	He sells guns.
M	NICOLET	You ever see him sell guns?
F	JACKIE	No.
M	NICOLET	Then how do you know he sells guns?
F	JACKIE	He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
M	NICOLET	How can you help us?
F	JACKIE	Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
M	DARGUS	You don't want much, do you?
F	JACKIE	Can you do it or not?
M	DARGUS	It's your call.
M	NICOLET	It's possible.
F	ORDELL	We're back.
F	MELANIE	'Ola!
F	MELANIE	Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
F	ORDELL	We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
M	LOUIS	I didn't look like a bum.
F	ORDELL	But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
F	ORDELL	Goddam, girl. You gettin' high already. It's only two o'clock.
F	MELANIE	It's that late?
F	ORDELL	Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
F	MELANIE	Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
F	ORDELL	You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs, ain't ya. Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
F	ORDELL	Hello. Hey, Jackie... No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
F	MELANIE	I was gonna tell you...
F	ORDELL	No, not on the phone, let's meet somewhere. But you gotta make sure they ain't followin' you...
M	LOUIS	Is it ready to go?
F	MELANIE	Yeah, there's another hit left.
F	JACKIE	The Cockatoo Inn.
F	ORDELL	The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
F	JACKIE	It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
F	ORDELL	Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
F	JACKIE	It's a cockatoo.
F	MELANIE	You okay?
M	LOUIS	Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
F	MELANIE	Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
F	ORDELL	Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile. So since you like gettin' high so much, why don't you stay here with Melanie, get high, and watch cartoons?
M	LOUIS	Way ahead of you.
F	ORDELL	So you just watch this for the next three hours, and I'll be back. Then, when I'm through with all my business, I'll get high. I get high at night. Walk me to the door, space girl.
F	ORDELL	Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
F	MELANIE	No problem.
F	ORDELL	Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
F	ORDELL	I'll be back in an hour, man. Just hang with Mel.
F	MELANIE	Want a Metrix?
M	LOUIS	What's a Metrix?
F	MELANIE	It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
M	LOUIS	It's a diet thing?
F	MELANIE	No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
M	LOUIS	No thanks.
M	LOUIS	How old were you here?
F	MELANIE	Which one?
M	LOUIS	The roller disco one.
F	MELANIE	Fourteen.
M	LOUIS	You're fourteen years old here?
F	MELANIE	Yeah.
M	LOUIS	I thought you were sixteen.
F	MELANIE	I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
M	LOUIS	Were you a disco girl?
F	MELANIE	Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
M	LOUIS	So where did you go?
F	MELANIE	The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
F	MELANIE	That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
M	LOUIS	No.
F	MELANIE	Where were you?
M	LOUIS	Detroit.
F	MELANIE	With Ordell?
M	LOUIS	We had done time together already.
F	MELANIE	Were you a disco guy?
M	LOUIS	No.
F	MELANIE	C'mon, don't lie.
M	LOUIS	I don't like dancing.
F	MELANIE	Did you ever go I one?
M	LOUIS	I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars. Who didn't make the cut?
F	MELANIE	That's a picture of me in Japan.
M	LOUIS	You been to Japan?
F	MELANIE	I lived there for about nine months.
M	LOUIS	You lived in Japan, when?
F	MELANIE	About five years ago.
M	LOUIS	Who's arm is that?
F	MELANIE	That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
M	LOUIS	Must of made quite an impression.
F	MELANIE	I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
M	LOUIS	That sounds like a problem.
F	MELANIE	Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.
F	MELANIE	Wanna fuck?
M	LOUIS	Sure.
F	MELANIE	That was fun.
M	LOUIS	Yeah, that really hit the spot. Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
F	ORDELL	I gotta remember this place. This is all right. Two minutes from your crib, ten minutes from your work. Not bad...
M	FLOYD	What's your drink, brother?
F	ORDELL	Screwdriver.
M	FLOYD	How you doin'?
F	JACKIE	I'm fine.
M	FLOYD	Yes, you are.
F	ORDELL	I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
F	JACKIE	I do okay.
F	ORDELL	You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
F	JACKIE	I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
F	ORDELL	How the fuck they know that?
F	JACKIE	I told them.
M	FLOYD	Three twenty-five.
F	ORDELL	Keep it.
M	FLOYD	Thank you, sir.
F	ORDELL	You told em? You told em it's me?
F	JACKIE	They already know it's you.
F	ORDELL	Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
F	JACKIE	Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
F	ORDELL	Didja tell 'em anything else?
F	JACKIE	I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
F	ORDELL	You told them that?
F	JACKIE	It's true, isn't it?
F	ORDELL	What the fuck's that got to do with it?
F	JACKIE	They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
F	ORDELL	What did they say?
F	JACKIE	Yes.
F	MELANIE	...so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit's too competitive. Piss the wrong person off, you get shot. So he says, fuck that -- moves over to guns. You can sell guns wherever there's a demand. No one gives a shit. He acts like he's this big international arms dealer, when, come on, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
M	LOUIS	He seems to be making out.
F	MELANIE	Is it dead?
M	LOUIS	Yeah.
F	MELANIE	Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
M	LOUIS	I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
F	MELANIE	He moves his lips when he reads, what does that tell ya. Let's say he's streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's still a fuckup.
F	MELANIE	He killed a man worked for him the other night.
M	LOUIS	So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
F	MELANIE	That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went?
M	LOUIS	No.
F	MELANIE	He went to meet that stewardess.
M	LOUIS	Does that bother you?
F	MELANIE	Please.
M	LOUIS	You live with him.
F	MELANIE	I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
M	LOUIS	Uh-huh?
F	MELANIE	Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
M	LOUIS	And your point is?
F	MELANIE	Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
M	LOUIS	Uh-huh?
F	MELANIE	...and just take it from him.
F	JACKIE	...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
F	ORDELL	Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
F	JACKIE	You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
F	ORDELL	That's a good idea.
F	JACKIE	If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
F	ORDELL	Who?
F	JACKIE	I don't know. One of your friends.
F	ORDELL	A woman.
F	JACKIE	If you want.
F	ORDELL	Yeah, I think a woman.
F	JACKIE	The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
F	ORDELL	But you don't?
F	JACKIE	No, I give it to someone else first.
F	ORDELL	And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
F	JACKIE	That's the idea.
F	ORDELL	So we need two people, two women.
F	JACKIE	Can you cover that?
F	ORDELL	I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
F	JACKIE	I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
F	ORDELL	I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
F	JACKIE	Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
F	ORDELL	Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
F	JACKIE	I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
F	ORDELL	Managers get ten percent.
F	JACKIE	That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
F	ORDELL	I'll give ya ten.
F	JACKIE	Plus the same deal as before.
F	ORDELL	I can do that. You have one message. Sent at 8:06 P.M.
M	MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)	Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just calling to find out how everything went today with A.T.F. If you want to call me, my home number is 555- 6788, or you can reach me at my office, which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on the card I gave you when we first met -- I don't know if you still have that -- but it's on it -- Oh, let me give you my beeper number. It's 555-7839. Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.
M	MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)	End of message.
F	JACKIE	The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
F	ORDELL	Uh-huh.
F	JACKIE	Who?
F	ORDELL	What'd you care?
F	JACKIE	Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
F	ORDELL	I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
F	JACKIE	Don't forget your bag.
M	JACKIE (O.S.)	Max.
M	MAX	Well, hello.
F	JACKIE	Surprise.
M	MAX	I walked right past you.
F	JACKIE	I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
M	MAX	Catching a movie.
F	JACKIE	What'd ya see?
M	MAX	"American President"
F	JACKIE	How was it?
M	MAX	Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
F	JACKIE	Oh, are you? Does she know that?
M	MAX	No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
F	ORDELL	What's up with this shit.
M	MAX	I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
F	JACKIE	Does it happen to all men?
M	MAX	Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
F	JACKIE	And Annette's it for you?
M	MAX	For now. These relationships never last too long.
F	JACKIE	That's a goddam man for ya. Can't even be faithful to a fuckin' movie star.
F	JACKIE	Who was your girl before Annette?
M	MAX	Sandra Bullock. You know her?
F	JACKIE	Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
M	MAX	She's adorable. But I had to end it.
F	JACKIE	Why?
M	MAX	I'm old enough to be her father.
F	JACKIE	How old's Annette?
M	MAX	I don't care.
M	MAX	What're you, a bag lady?
F	JACKIE	I go back to work tomorrow.
M	MAX	You talk them into it?
F	JACKIE	They seem to like the idea.
M	MAX	Bring the money in and they follow it?
F	JACKIE	Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
M	MAX	You don't actually do it that way?
F	JACKIE	He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
M	MAX	Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
F	JACKIE	Right around here, in the food court.
M	MAX	Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
M	MAX	Will Ordell go for that?
F	JACKIE	I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
M	MAX	He was here?
F	JACKIE	Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
M	MAX	I called you last night.
F	JACKIE	I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
M	MAX	You think he's got a thing for you?
F	JACKIE	Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
M	MAX	I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
F	JACKIE	He's setting me up to make a proposition.
M	MAX	I see.
F	JACKIE	You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
M	MAX	Has he hinted around?
F	JACKIE	Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
M	MAX	You know some interesting people.
F	JACKIE	He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
M	MAX	Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
F	JACKIE	He tries to act cool.
M	MAX	No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
F	JACKIE	What about you Max?
M	MAX	What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
F	JACKIE	No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
M	MAX	If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
F	JACKIE	You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
M	MAX	A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
F	JACKIE	You're avoiding the question.
M	MAX	Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
M	MAX	I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
F	JACKIE	Why?
M	MAX	A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
F	JACKIE	When did you decide?
M	MAX	It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
M	MAX	Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
F	JACKIE	The day you got me out of jail?
M	MAX	Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
F	JACKIE	Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
M	MAX	Uh-huh. I dropped you off...
M	MAX (V.O.)	Went to my office, found out you took my gun... Got another gun and a stun gun...
M	MAX	And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
F	JACKIE	What do you do when he comes home?
M	MAX	Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
F	JACKIE	You do that?
M	MAX	That's my job. Did you do it that night?
M	MAX	He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
F	JACKIE	And is that it?
M	MAX	More or less.
F	JACKIE	I'm not sure you answered my question.
M	MAX	Which one?
F	JACKIE	If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
M	MAX	I believe I said I'd be tempted.
M	MAX	Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
F	JACKIE	What if I've figured a way?
F	JACKIE	Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye... Bye bye... Bye bye... Goodbye.
M	NICOLET	We gotta stop meeting this way.
M	DARGUS	How was your flight?
F	JACKIE	Fine.
M	DARGUS	Bet you're happy to be working again.
M	NICOLET	This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
F	JACKIE	What are you doing?
M	NICOLET	I'm recording this.
F	JACKIE	I thought you were going to let this one through.
M	DARGUS	We are. Don't worry about it.
M	NICOLET	Every step of this goes in my report. I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
M	NICOLET	The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
M	DARGUS	What time do you have to be there?
F	JACKIE	Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
M	DARGUS	What's her name?
F	JACKIE	He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
M	DARGUS	She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
F	JACKIE	But you're not going to stop her?
M	NICOLET	The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
F	JACKIE	A Broadway shopping bag.
M	NICOLET	A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag with handles and brown lettering.
M	MAX	Cafè mocha.
M	BUSTA CAP GIRL	You want whipped cream on that?
M	MAX	No, thanks.
F	JACKIE	Think of it as money that shouldn't even be here. I mean does anybody have a right to it?
M	MAX	The feds. It's evidence.
F	JACKIE	It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
M	YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)	Is this seat taken?
F	JACKIE	Have a seat.
F	JACKIE	You're hungry?
M	YOUNG GIRL	Yes'm.
F	JACKIE	Put your bag on the floor, okay? Under the table, right next to mine.
F	JACKIE	Then when I leave, well, you know. What's your name?
M	YOUNG GIRL	Sheronda?
F	JACKIE	Go ahead, start eating.
F	JACKIE	Would it bother you if I smoked?
F	JACKIE	Sheronda, can I ask you a question? Are you and Ordell married?
M	SHERONDA	He say we like the same thing as married.
F	JACKIE	Do you live together?
M	SHERONDA	Most of the times.
F	JACKIE	Not every day?
M	SHERONDA	Sometimes every day, for a while.
F	JACKIE	Then you don't see him for a few days?
M	SHERONDA	Yes'm.
F	JACKIE	You know what's in the bag you're taking?
M	SHERONDA	He say is a surprise.
F	JACKIE	Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
F	JACKIE	You said it yourself. Ray wants Ordell, he don't give a shit about the money. Money won't convict him, guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in their lap, they take it. If they know they got it, they'll look for it... but if they don't...
M	MAX	You're rationalizing.
F	JACKIE	That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
M	MAX	It could work... If she handles the cops right, I could work...
F	ORDELL	Check this out.
M	LOUIS	How much is there?
F	ORDELL	Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
M	LOUIS	Can I ask you about Melanie?
F	ORDELL	Sure.
M	LOUIS	What's your relationship?
F	ORDELL	She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
M	LOUIS	She believed you?
F	ORDELL	Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
M	LOUIS	Do you trust Melanie?
F	ORDELL	If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
M	LOUIS	That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
F	ORDELL	She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
M	LOUIS	Yep.
F	ORDELL	You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
M	LOUIS	Well, why the fuck keep her around?
F	ORDELL	'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
M	LOUIS	Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
F	ORDELL	I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
M	LOUIS	What does that mean?
F	ORDELL	You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
M	LOUIS	I still don't understand why you keep her around.
F	ORDELL	I told you, man. She my fine little surfer gal.
M	MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)	What?
F	JACKIE	It's Jackie.
F	ORDELL	...Now she's gonna pout...
F	ORDELL	Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.
F	ORDELL	She gonna hafta find her sandals... find her bag... find her sunglasses... take twenty damn minutes get her ass out the door. Jackie -- this is Louis, Louis -- Jackie. And the chick stompin' around in the other room is Melanie.
F	ORDELL	You have a nice time, hear?
F	ORDELL	Drink?
F	JACKIE	I need to talk to you alone.
F	JACKIE	I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
F	ORDELL	What the hell you talkin' bout?
F	JACKIE	Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
F	ORDELL	How do you know she did that?
F	JACKIE	I was there, I saw her do it.
F	ORDELL	Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
F	JACKIE	I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
F	ORDELL	Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
F	JACKIE	Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
F	ORDELL	Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It ain't no big thing. The woman you saw was my friend, Simone. She's the one gonna be receiving the money, so I just wanted her to see how it works. She'll be here any minute. Nice woman, you'll like her.
F	ORDELL	Louis, call Simone and tell her to get her tail over here. We're waitin' on her ass.
F	ORDELL	I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I can't tempt you?
F	JACKIE	Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
F	ORDELL	Man, I don't like that part.
F	JACKIE	It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
F	ORDELL	She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
F	JACKIE	Are you sure she don't know about the money?
F	ORDELL	She don't know shit about the money.
F	JACKIE	What does she think she's gettin?
F	ORDELL	I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither. No answer?
M	LOUIS	Uh-huh.
F	ORDELL	Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
F	ORDELL	No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
F	JACKIE	Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
F	ORDELL	She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
F	JACKIE	Designer clothes. She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
F	JACKIE	The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
M	LOUIS	Why we doin' it there?
F	JACKIE	I have a hunch they'll be watchin' me. We can't risk switching bags out in the open or even in the dining area. That's why it has to be a woman, 'cause we do the switch in the fitting room.
F	ORDELL	So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
F	JACKIE	Where you gonna be during all this?
F	ORDELL	I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
F	JACKIE	I gotta go.
F	ORDELL	Who's paging you?
F	JACKIE	Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
F	ORDELL	That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
F	JACKIE	If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
F	ORDELL	Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
F	JACKIE	And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
F	ORDELL	We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
F	JACKIE	Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
F	ORDELL	Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
F	JACKIE	He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
F	ORDELL	Don't you know all them bail bondsmen are crooks...
F	JACKIE	Do you have a phone?
M	WANDA	Yeah, it's in the back.
F	JACKIE	Thanks.
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	Hey!
F	JACKIE	Oh, hi.
F	MELANIE	Buy ya a beer?
F	JACKIE	I'm waiting for the phone.
F	MELANIE	Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
F	JACKIE	Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
F	MELANIE	I know what you and Ordell got goin'. You sit down and have a beer with me. I'll tell you a secret.
F	JACKIE	Sure.
F	MELANIE	Great... ...Wanda!
M	WANDA	What?
F	MELANIE	This lady is thirsty.
M	WANDA	What do you want?
F	MELANIE	What's on tap?
M	WANDA	Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and Killian's Red.
F	JACKIE	Killian's.
F	MELANIE	Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
F	JACKIE	Uh-uh.
F	MELANIE	Gimme one anyway.
M	WANDA	You got it.
F	JACKIE	How long you been with Ordell?
F	MELANIE	This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
F	JACKIE	What were you two fighting about?
F	MELANIE	He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
F	MELANIE	Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
F	JACKIE	That coke was yours, wasn't it?
F	MELANIE	Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about that. I hope they don't come down on you on my account. Ordell should'a told you it was in your bag.
M	WANDA	Seven dollars.
F	JACKIE	He said he didn't know about it.
F	MELANIE	You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
F	MELANIE	He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
F	JACKIE	Beaumont Livingston?
F	MELANIE	You already knew that?
F	JACKIE	Kinda.
F	MELANIE	So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
F	MELANIE	I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to carry in ten thousand dollars, that would be the last motherfuckin' time he saw me. The next trip you're gonna have over half-a-million. If you thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure as hell wouldn't blame you.
F	MELANIE	You think I'm kidding?
F	JACKIE	Dreaming.
F	MELANIE	You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
F	JACKIE	Keep it between us girls?
F	MELANIE	What's that fucker ever done for us?
F	JACKIE	I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
F	MELANIE	Chicken shit.
F	JACKIE	Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
M	NICOLET	You two meet?
F	JACKIE	This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
M	NICOLET	You talk to him?
F	JACKIE	Not really.
M	NICOLET	His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
F	JACKIE	What for?
M	NICOLET	Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
F	JACKIE	I imagine shit needs to be done.
M	NICOLET	We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
M	NICOLET (V.O.)	They served two years together almost twenty years ago in Soledad. But he doesn't live in Hermosa Beach. Ordell's got him staying at a house in... ...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
M	NICOLET	Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
F	JACKIE	Not yet.
M	NICOLET	Who's the other one?
F	JACKIE	White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
M	NICOLET	What's her story?
F	JACKIE	It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
M	NICOLET	And splittin' with her?
F	JACKIE	I'm sure that was the idea.
M	NICOLET	What did you say?
F	JACKIE	I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
M	NICOLET	She told you that?
F	JACKIE	Uh-huh.
M	NICOLET	Was she there?
F	JACKIE	She didn't say.
M	NICOLET	But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
F	JACKIE	Uh-huh.
M	NICOLET	Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
F	JACKIE	Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
F	JACKIE	I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
M	MAX	Do you think they bought it?
F	JACKIE	Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
M	MAX	You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
F	JACKIE	All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
F	JACKIE	Right. Everything's the same except one change. Ordell thinks it's just too hot right now to bring in all his money.
M	MAX	It'll be more than that.
F	JACKIE	Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
M	MAX	But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
F	JACKIE	Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
M	MAX	Where's the rest of it?
F	JACKIE	In the bag underneath.
M	MAX	What if he checks it?
F	JACKIE	He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
M	MAX	You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
F	JACKIE	Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
M	MAX	Then you're out and you get nothing.
F	JACKIE	Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
M	MAX	You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
F	JACKIE	That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
M	MAX	In a dress.
F	JACKIE	Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
F	JACKIE	Excuse me.
F	ORDELL	It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout -- everything's the same -- except for one change. That bitch you saw in the mall, Simone. She wasn't here today, cause she split on me. Me an Louis went over to her place, she's gone. She's gone and all her shit's gone and so's my ten thousand dollars. It ain't nothin' to worry about, girl. Everything's just like we discussed. Except when you do the switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna be Melanie.
F	MELANIE	Chicken shit.
M	PASSENGER	Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink and you spend half the fuckin' flight in the can. Soon as we land I'm making a formal complaint.
F	JACKIE	Why, because I called you an asshole.
M	PASSENGER	You didn't call me that.
F	JACKIE	I didn't? Oh, well, you're an asshole.
M	NICOLET	We have to stop meeting like this.
F	JACKIE	You said that the last time.
M	NICOLET	Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
F	JACKIE	We could, if I'm not in jail.
M	NICOLET	Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
F	JACKIE	Are you saying I'm off the hook?
M	NICOLET	Free as a bird. I still expect you to finish the job, though. How much do you have this time?
F	JACKIE	Fifty thousand, like I said. He's pretty sure he's gonna need it for bail.
M	NICOLET	That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
F	JACKIE	I was told ten thousand in each pack.
M	NICOLET	You didn't count it?
F	JACKIE	I never have. It's not my money.
M	NICOLET	He might have slipped some coke in here. Did you check?
F	JACKIE	Mr. Walker promised he'd never do that again.
F	JACKIE	Ever been tempted?
M	NICOLET	What? To put one of these in my pocket?
F	JACKIE	Uh-huh.
M	NICOLET	If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
F	JACKIE	Yes. All those things are true.
M	NICOLET	After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
F	JACKIE	That would be one point of view.
M	NICOLET	Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
F	JACKIE	How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
M	NICOLET	I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you. Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
F	JACKIE	Si.
M	MAX	I'm going out for a few hours.
M	WINSTON	Hold on a minute. Where you going?
M	MAX	I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
M	WINSTON	Watcha gonna see?
M	MAX	Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
M	WINSTON	Have fun.
F	ORDELL	What the fuck are you two still doing there?!
M	LOUIS	I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.
F	ORDELL	Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
M	LOUIS	Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
F	ORDELL	Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
M	LOUIS	We're leaving now!
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	All right already.
F	AMY	Can I help you?
F	JACKIE	Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
F	AMY	Oh, my God. You look so cool.
F	JACKIE	This looks pretty good on me.
F	AMY	Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
F	JACKIE	I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
F	AMY	Not a problem.
F	JACKIE	Thanks.
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	Jackie?
F	JACKIE	Hi, Melanie. Are you getting that black suit?
F	JACKIE	Yeah, do you like it?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	It looks good on you.
F	JACKIE	Do you got something for me?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	You betcha.
F	MELANIE	We coulda worked this. You know that, dontcha? You would've made out a lot better than you're going to, believe me.
F	JACKIE	I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	Thanks.
F	JACKIE	Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
F	JACKIE	I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
F	AMY	Oh, that's not a problem.
F	JACKIE	Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels.
F	JACKIE	Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She took the money.
F	JACKIE	Melanie burst in the dressing room and took the money!
M	LOUIS	Come on, goddammit, we're late!
F	MELANIE	Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
M	LOUIS	We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
F	AMY	...You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room...
F	MELANIE	That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
M	LOUIS	Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
F	MELANIE	Are you sweating?
F	MELANIE	Job a little too much for you?
F	MELANIE	I'll be over here. You're too conspicuous.
M	LOUIS	Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
M	MAX CHERRY	Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the fitting room.
M	LOUIS	What are you doin'?
F	MELANIE	I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
M	LOUIS	Lemme have the bag.
F	MELANIE	Fuck you. I can carry it.
M	LOUIS	Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
F	MELANIE	Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
M	LOUIS	Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
F	MELANIE	Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's wrong with you?
M	LOUIS	I'm carrying it.
F	MELANIE	Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
M	LOUIS	Fuck you with your chill pill.
F	MELANIE	Remember where we came in?
F	MELANIE	Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came in through Bullocks. I know where it is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
F	MELANIE	You have no idea where you parked, do you?
F	MELANIE	Jesus, but if you two aren't the biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my life... How did you ever rob a bank? When you robbed banks, did you have to look for your car then too? No wonder you went to jail.
F	MELANIE	Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
M	LOUIS	Yeah, down the end.
F	MELANIE	You sure?
F	MELANIE	Is it this aisle or the next one over?
M	LOUIS	This one.
F	MELANIE	You sure?
M	LOUIS	Don't say anything else, okay? I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut.
M	LOUIS	I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
F	MELANIE	Okay, Lou-is.
M	LOUIS	See, just where I fuckin' said it was!
M	LOUIS	Hey, look. I found it!
M	SALESGIRL	Can I show you something?
M	MAX	Not right now. I'm just killing time waiting for my wife. But thanks, anyway.
M	SALESGIRL	Sure thing. If anything grabs you, don't be shy.
M	MAX	Thanks, I won't.
F	AMY	Oh, my God. You look so cool.
M	MAX	And away we go.
F	JACKIE	Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels.
M	MAX	Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks. You walk over to that counter, you're gonna find out what it's like.
M	MAX	Excuse me, but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room?
F	AMY	Yeah, I think they're back there. Go get 'em. There's nobody in there. I think they're in the last stall.
M	MAX	Thanks.
M	MAX	Got 'em, thanks.
F	AMY	Sure thing.
M	BARTENDER	There a Ordell here?
F	ORDELL	That's me.
M	BARTENDER	Don't talks all day.
M	LOUIS	It's Louis.
F	ORDELL	Did you get it?
M	LOUIS	I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
F	ORDELL	When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
M	LOUIS	I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
F	ORDELL	Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.
M	LOUIS	That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
F	ORDELL	Not now, pick me up.
F	ORDELL	You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about. Hey, where's Melanie?
M	LOUIS	That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
F	ORDELL	So what, you left her there.
M	LOUIS	I shot her.
M	LOUIS	I expect she's dead.
F	ORDELL	You shot Melanie?
M	LOUIS	Twice. In the parking lot.
F	ORDELL	Couldn't talk to her?
M	LOUIS	You know how she is.
F	ORDELL	You couldn't just hit her?
M	LOUIS	Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
F	ORDELL	You shot her twice?
M	LOUIS	Uh-huh.
F	ORDELL	So you're sure she's dead.
M	LOUIS	Pretty sure.
F	ORDELL	Where did you shoot her?
M	LOUIS	In the chest and stomach.
F	ORDELL	to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
F	ORDELL	Louis?
M	LOUIS	What?
F	ORDELL	Where's the rest of it?
M	LOUIS	How much it there?
F	ORDELL	Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
M	LOUIS	You said five hundred and fifty!
F	ORDELL	So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
M	LOUIS	Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
F	ORDELL	Came outta where?
M	LOUIS	The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
F	ORDELL	How long was she in there?
M	LOUIS	Maybe a minute. She came right out.
F	ORDELL	Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
M	LOUIS	Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
F	ORDELL	Then what?
M	LOUIS	We went to the parking lot.
F	ORDELL	Where you shot her.
M	LOUIS	That's right.
F	ORDELL	You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
M	LOUIS	Fuck you for asking me that.
F	ORDELL	Pull the car over.
F	ORDELL	What'd you shoot her with?
M	LOUIS	It's in there.
M	LOUIS	What's that gonna tell you? If I was really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken two out, wouldn't I? I thought you trusted me.
F	JACKIE	Gotcha, nigga.
F	ORDELL	Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
M	LOUIS	If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
F	ORDELL	'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
M	LOUIS	Maybe the Feds got it.
F	ORDELL	If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
M	LOUIS	That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
F	ORDELL	Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
M	LOUIS	I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
F	ORDELL	Or... ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
M	LOUIS	Jesus Christ.
F	ORDELL	What?
M	LOUIS	You know who I saw in the dress department?
F	ORDELL	Tell me.
M	LOUIS	I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
F	ORDELL	You gonna tell me who it was?
M	LOUIS	Max Cherry.
F	ORDELL	You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
M	LOUIS	Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
F	ORDELL	Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
M	LOUIS	How am I supposed to know that?
F	ORDELL	You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
M	LOUIS	Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
F	ORDELL	Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
M	LOUIS	I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
F	ORDELL	Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
M	LOUIS	You best back off.
F	ORDELL	What the fuck happened to you, man? Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.
M	NICOLET	You didn't tell me you were gonna do some shopping.
F	JACKIE	I thought I did.
M	NICOLET	You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
F	JACKIE	I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
M	NICOLET	But you didn't do that.
F	JACKIE	Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it.
M	NICOLET	Where's the bag she gave you?
F	JACKIE	She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
M	NICOLET	You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
F	JACKIE	I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
M	NICOLET	What did you do after that?
F	JACKIE	I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
M	NICOLET	There was a guy with Melanie?
F	JACKIE	Not in the fitting room.
M	NICOLET (V.O.)	We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
M	NICOLET	This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
F	JACKIE	I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
M	NICOLET	It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
F	JACKIE	I have no idea.
M	NICOLET	You'd take a polygraph on it?
F	JACKIE	If it'll make you happy.
M	NICOLET	I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
M	DARGUS	Can I have a word with you?
M	NICOLET	Sure.
M	NICOLET	Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
F	JACKIE	I thought you were watching him.
M	NICOLET	We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
F	JACKIE	So what happens now?
M	NICOLET	We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
F	JACKIE	What about me?
M	NICOLET	What about you?
F	JACKIE	Do you think I took some of that money?
M	NICOLET	I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
M	NICOLET	I'll settle for Ordell with the marked bills. If you have something else going on you haven't told me about, it's between you and Ordell. All I gotta say is, you better hope we find him before he finds you.
F	ORDELL	...I can't leave here today... Mr. Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I get my money... You wouldn't have that fuckin' boat weren't for me. Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my friends are... Mr. Walker?
F	ORDELL	Can you believe that shit? Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate nigger. Do things for people and that's how they treat you. Goddamn girl, how can you live like this?
M	RAYNELLE	Like what?
F	ORDELL	Girl, this shit is repugnant.
M	WINSTON (O.S.)	Cherry Bail Bonds.
F	ORDELL	Let me speak to Max Cherry.
M	WINSTON	He ain't here right now.
F	ORDELL	He leave town?
M	WINSTON	He's around.
F	ORDELL	Give me his home number.
M	WINSTON	I'll give you his beeper.
F	ORDELL	Hello.
M	MAX	I've been looking for you.
F	ORDELL	You know who this is?
M	MAX	Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
M	MAX	The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
F	ORDELL	She got off, huh?
M	MAX	They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
M	MAX	You still there?
F	ORDELL	Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
M	MAX	You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
M	WINSTON	Cops can't locate him, huh?
M	MAX	They don't have your winning personality.
M	WINSTON	Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
M	MAX	I think I do. Is that good enough?
F	JACKIE	Hello.
M	MAX	I know where he is.
F	JACKIE	How'd you find out?
M	MAX	All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
F	JACKIE	How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
M	MAX	People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
F	JACKIE	He's liable to shoot you.
M	MAX	On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
F	JACKIE	Ray wants him.
M	MAX	Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
F	JACKIE	That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
M	MAX	It's not that simple.
F	JACKIE	It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
M	MAX	So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
F	JACKIE	Get Ordell to come to your office.
M	MAX	Set him up.
F	JACKIE	Uh-huh.
M	MAX	Tell him you want to see him?
F	JACKIE	Tell him I want to give him his money.
M	MAX	Why?
F	JACKIE	I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
M	MAX	What do you tell Nicolet?
F	JACKIE	Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
M	MAX	We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
F	JACKIE	He's already there.
M	MAX	What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
F	JACKIE	Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
F	ORDELL	What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
M	MAX	I thought you might be asleep.
F	ORDELL	You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
M	MAX	I'm alone.
F	ORDELL	Git your ass in here.
F	ORDELL	You better freeze, motherfucker!
M	MAX	You want your money? Your bond refund?
F	ORDELL	That's all?
M	MAX	I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
F	ORDELL	You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
M	MAX	She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
F	ORDELL	How'd you find me?
M	MAX	Winston found you.
F	ORDELL	How the fuck did he find me?
M	MAX	That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
F	ORDELL	Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
M	MAX	Uh-huh.
F	ORDELL	Well, give it to me then. She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
F	ORDELL	I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
M	MAX	Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
F	ORDELL	Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
M	MAX	All I did was walk out with it.
F	ORDELL	And you did that to protect my interest?
M	MAX	In a way, yes.
F	ORDELL	My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
M	MAX	This place stinks.
F	ORDELL	You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
M	MAX	My office.
F	ORDELL	And where's Jackie?
M	MAX	She's been there since Thursday night.
F	ORDELL	She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
M	MAX	She was afraid.
F	ORDELL	That I gotta see.
M	MAX	She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
F	ORDELL	Have her bring the money here.
M	MAX	It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
F	ORDELL	Call her, tell her the combination.
M	MAX	I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
F	ORDELL	You expect me to just walk in there?
M	MAX	If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
F	ORDELL	That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
M	MAX	Uh-huh.
F	ORDELL	By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
M	MAX	She's all alone.
F	ORDELL	I call your office, she better answer the phone.
M	MAX	She will.
F	JACKIE	I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.
F	ORDELL	All the time I've known her, I never heard her sound scared like that. Ordinarily she's too cool for school. I'm driving, gimme the keys.
M	MAX	It's the next street.
F	ORDELL	I know where it is.
M	MAX	Turn left.
F	ORDELL	I know where to turn.
F	ORDELL	My money's in that office, right?
M	MAX	Uh-huh.
F	ORDELL	She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it. I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
M	MAX	Yeah.
F	ORDELL	Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
M	MAX	No.
F	ORDELL	You sure?
M	MAX	Yes.
F	ORDELL	You better be, motherfucker.
F	ORDELL	Get ahead of me and open the door.
F	ORDELL	Step inside easy.
F	ORDELL	Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting in the goddamn dark for?
F	JACKIE	Mark... ...he's got a gun!
M	DARGUS	He's dead.
M	DARGUS	Does he have the marked bills on him?
M	MAX	In his inside coat pocket.
M	DARGUS	Why were you with him?
M	MAX	I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
M	DARGUS	How'd you know where he was?
M	MAX	I found out.
M	DARGUS	And you didn't tell the Police?
M	MAX	I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
F	JACKIE	Remember when Ray said you hoped you'd get him before he got me?
F	JACKIE	Well, you did. Thank you.
M	JACKIE (O.S.)	Knock knock.
F	JACKIE	Hey.
F	JACKIE	Mark... he's got a gun!
M	MAX	Hey, you.
F	JACKIE	I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
M	MAX	Less ten percent.
F	JACKIE	Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
F	JACKIE	Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
M	MAX	I hesitated taking that much.
F	JACKIE	You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
M	MAX	I'm sure.
F	JACKIE	I'm leaving, I have my things in my car. Why don't you walk out with me? I want to show you something.
F	JACKIE	Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.
F	JACKIE	I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
M	MAX	What's he doing?
F	JACKIE	He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
M	MAX	Did you tell him you were leaving?
F	JACKIE	I told him I might.
M	MAX	That's Ordell's.
F	JACKIE	They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
M	MAX	Not after they're dead.
F	JACKIE	I didn't use you, Max.
M	MAX	I didn't say you did.
F	JACKIE	I never lied to you.
M	MAX	I know.
F	JACKIE	We're partners.
M	MAX	I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
F	JACKIE	Do you blame yourself for helping me?
F	JACKIE	I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
M	MAX	You'll get over that.
M	MAX	Where're you going?
F	JACKIE	Spain.
M	MAX	Madrid or Barcelona?
F	JACKIE	Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
F	JACKIE	I hear they don't eat dinner till midnight.
F	JACKIE	Wanna go?
M	MAX	Thanks, but you have a good time.
F	JACKIE	Sure I can't twist your arm?
M	MAX	Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
F	JACKIE	I thought you were tired of your business?
M	MAX	I'm just tired in general.
F	JACKIE	Are you scared of me?
M	MAX	A little bit.
F	JACKIE	Come over here.
F	JACKIE	I'll send you a postcard, partner.
M	THE END
