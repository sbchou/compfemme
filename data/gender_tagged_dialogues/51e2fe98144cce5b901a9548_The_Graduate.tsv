M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BEN	-- and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncompromising ambition would be meaningless. But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.
M	BEN	The purpose, my fellow graduates -- the purpose is --
M	BEN	-- there is a reason, my friends, and the reason is --
M	BEN	-- the reason is -- the purpose is --
M	CAPTAIN'S VOICE	Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles --
M	CAPTAIN'S VOICE	The sound you have just heard is the landing gear locking into place. The Los Angeles weather is clear and the temperature is a pleasant 72. We do not expect any traffic delay and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the nose. We enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you again in the near future.
M	STEWARDESS' VOICE	Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your seat belts in preparation for the landing and observe the no smoking sign. After we land, you will notice an increase in the sound level as the thrust of the engines is reversed to help reduce forward speed.
M	MAN'S VOICE	Your attention, please! American Airlines Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop to New York is now leaving from Gate Number 40. All aboard, please.
M	MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE	-- associate editor of the college newspaper in his junior year -- managing editor in his senior year --
M	MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE	What's the matter?
M	MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE	The guests are all downstairs, Ben. They're all waiting to see you.
M	BEN	Look, Dad - could you explain to them that I have to be alone for a while?
M	MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE	These are all our good friends, Ben. Most of them have known you since -- well -- practically since you were born.
M	MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE	What is it, Ben?
M	BEN	I'm just --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	-- worried?
M	BEN	Well --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	About what?
M	BEN	I guess -- about my future.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	What about it?
M	BEN	I don't know. I want it to be --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	To be what?
M	BEN	Different.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Is anything wrong?
F	MR. BRADDOCK	No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	The Carlsons' are here.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	They are? Come on.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	They came all the way from Tarzana.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
M	MR. CARLSON	Hey -- there's our award winning scholar.
M	MRS. CARLSON	We're all very proud of you, Ben.
M	BEN	Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.
M	MR. CARLSON	Is that the new car out there? The little red Wop job?
F	MR. BRADDOCK	That's Ben's graduation present.
M	MR. CARLSON	Won't have much trouble picking them up in that, will you?
M	BEN	Sir?
M	MR. CARLSON	The girls. The chicks. The -- the teeny boppers.
M	MRS. CARLSON	I think Ben has gotten beyond the teeny bopper stage -- haven't you, Ben?
M	BEN	Yes, ma'am.
M	BEN	Excuse me -- I think I'd just like to check something on the car for a minute --
M	MR. LOOMIS	Here's the track star himself. How are you, track star?
M	BEN	Just fine, Mr. Loomis.
M	MR. LOOMIS	I want to get a drink and then I want to hear all about that thing you won. That Hopperman award.
M	BEN	Helpingham.
M	MR. LOOMIS	Helpingham! Right! Now you wait right here.
M	LADY 1	Ben -- we're all so proud of you.
M	LADY 2	Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.
M	LADY 3	What are you going to do now?
M	BEN	I was going to go upstairs for a minute --
M	LADY 3	No -- I meant with your future.
M	LADY 2	With your life.
M	BEN	Well -- that's a little hard to say --
M	MR. MCQUIRE	Ben!
M	BEN	Excuse me. Mr. McQuire.
M	MR. MCQUIRE	Ben.
M	BEN	Mr. McQuire.
M	MR. MCQUIRE	Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
M	BEN	Yes, sir.
M	MR. MCQUIRE	Are you listening?
M	BEN	Yes I am.
M	MR. MCQUIRE	Plastics.
M	BEN	Exactly how do you mean?
M	MR. MCQUIRE	There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
M	BEN	Yes, I will.
M	MR. MCQUIRE	Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
M	WOMAN #1	Here he is now. Here's Ben.
M	BEN	Excuse me just a minute --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
M	BEN	It's down the hall.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	How are you, Benjamin?
M	BEN	Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
M	BEN	Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean to be rude but --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Is there an ashtray in here?
M	BEN	No.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Is it a girl?
M	BEN	Is what a girl?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Whatever it is you're upset about.
M	BEN	Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	In general.
M	BEN	That's right.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Will you take me home?
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
M	BEN	Here -- you take it.
M	BEN	Do you know how to work a foreign shift?
M	BEN	You don't?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	Let's go. home. I'll be right back.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Wonderful party.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
M	BEN	Right.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Will you come in, please?
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
M	BEN	What for?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
M	BEN	But it's light in there now.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Please.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What do you drink? Bourbon?
M	BEN	Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
M	BEN	All right then.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What do you drink?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
M	BEN	Why not?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Please wait till my husband gets home.
M	BEN	When is he coming back?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't know.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Drink?
M	BEN	No.
M	BEN	Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
M	BEN	Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I'm very neurotic.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	May I ask you a question?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What do you think of me?
M	BEN	What do you mean?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
M	BEN	Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Did you know I was an alcoholic?
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Did you know that?
M	BEN	Look -- I think I should be going --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Sit down, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	My husband will be back quite late.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	He should be gone for several hours.
M	BEN	Oh my God.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Pardon?
M	BEN	Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What's wrong?
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Like what?
M	BEN	What do you think?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well I don't know.
M	BEN	For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	So?
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
M	BEN	Aren't you?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	It's all right.
M	BEN	It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Sit down.
M	BEN	Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	All right. Now finish your drink.
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
M	BEN	What is wrong with me?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
M	BEN	Her portrait?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
M	BEN	No.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
M	BEN	Very much.
M	BEN	Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she?
M	BEN	I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin?
M	BEN	Yes?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Will you unzip my dress?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I think I'll go to bed.
M	BEN	Oh. Well, goodnight.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Won't you unzip my dress?
M	BEN	I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
M	BEN	No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
M	BEN	I know that. But I'm --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Come on.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	It's hard for me to reach.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
M	BEN	Right.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What are you so scared of?
M	BEN	I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Then why do you keep running away?
M	BEN	Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
M	BEN	Yes, I have --
M	BEN	But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What if he did?
M	BEN	Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't you think he trusts us together?
M	BEN	Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
M	BEN	But they would! Don't you see?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
M	BEN	I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Why is it?
M	BEN	Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Would you like me to seduce you?
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Is that what you're trying to tell me?
M	BEN	I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	BENJAMIN?
M	BEN	Yes.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Will you bring up my purse before you go?
M	BEN	I have to go now. I'm sorry.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
M	BEN	Where is it?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	On that chair in the hall.
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson?
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	I'm in the bathroom.
M	BEN	Well here's the purse.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Could you bring it up?
M	BEN	Well I'll hand it to you.
M	BEN	Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
M	BEN	I'm putting it on the top step.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
M	BEN	I'm putting it here by the door.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Will you bring it in to me?
M	BEN	I'd rather not.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	All right. Put it in the room where we were.
M	BEN	Right.
M	BEN	Oh God.
M	BEN	Let me out.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't be nervous.
M	BEN	Get away from that door.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I want to say something first.
M	BEN	Jesus Christ!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
M	BEN	Oh my God.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
M	BEN	Let me out!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do you understand what I said?
M	BEN	Yes. Yes. Let me out!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Because I find you very attractive and any time --
M	MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Is that Ben's car in front?
M	BEN	Yes, sir!
M	BEN	I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Swell. I appreciate it.
M	BEN	She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
M	BEN	Yes, sir. Here. It looks like you need a refill.
M	BEN	Oh no.
F	MR. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	I've got to go.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
M	BEN	No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Come on. Let's have a nightcap together.
M	BEN	Thank you very much, sir.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Ben -- how old are you now?
M	BEN	Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
F	MR. ROBINSON	That's a hell of a good age to be.
M	BEN	Thank you.
F	MR. ROBINSON	I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
M	BEN	Sir?
F	MR. ROBINSON	You'll never be young again.
M	BEN	I know.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Ben, can I say something to you?
M	BEN	What?
F	MR. ROBINSON	How long have we known each other now?
F	MR. ROBINSON	How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
M	BEN	Quite a while.
F	MR. ROBINSON	I've watched you grow up, Ben.
M	BEN	Yes, sir.
F	MR. ROBINSON	In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
M	BEN	Thank you.
F	MR. ROBINSON	So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
M	BEN	I'd like to hear it.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come. Have a good time with the girls and so forth.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't get up.
F	MR. ROBINSON	I was just telling Ben here he ought to sow a few wild oats. Have a good time while he can. You think that's sound advice?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes, I do.
M	BEN	I've got to go.
F	MR. ROBINSON	You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
M	BEN	Oh no.
F	MR. ROBINSON	What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes, he does.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
M	BEN	Oh yes.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
M	BEN	I will.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Great.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin?
M	BEN	Yes.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you for taking me home.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I'll see you soon, I hope.
M	MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE	Ladies and gentlemen -- your attention, please -- for this afternoon's feature attraction.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Hey, over there -- I mean you! Your attention please!
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
M	BEN'S VOICE	Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
F	MR. BRADDOCK	-- what was I saying?
M	MRS. ARNOLD	Feature attraction.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Right. Hey -- I'm glad to see you're paying attention. A feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Now I'm going to ask for a big round of applause to bring this boy out here -- wait a minute -- let me amend that -- to bring this young man out here -- because today he is twenty- one-years-old --
M	MR. ARNOLD	Let's get on with the show!
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Just hang on a minute because I have a few words to say --
M	MR. ARNOLD	You always do.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
M	MR. ARNOLD	Bring him out!
M	PETER AND LOUISE	On with the show! On with the show!
F	MR. BRADDOCK	I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
M	BEN'S VOICE	I'd like to discuss this.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	-- before he does -- You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Dad -- can you listen --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	I'll give you ten seconds. He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	-- Benjamin Braddock!
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Folks -- this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep --
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Hello.
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Benjamin?
M	BEN	Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Where are you?
M	BEN	-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Where are you?
M	BEN	Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Did you get a room?
M	BEN	No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Give me an hour.
M	BEN	What?
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	I'll be there in an hour.
M	ROOM CLERK	Can I help you, sir!

M	MRS. SINGLEMAN	Braddock -- Braddock?
M	BEN	Yes, but I'm afraid --
M	MRS. SINGLEMAN	I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
M	BEN	No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
M	MRS. SINGLEMAN	I'm afraid I don't understand.

F	MRS. ROBINSON	Did you get us a room?
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Have you gotten us a room yet?
M	BEN	I haven't. No.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to?
M	BEN	Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.

M	ROOM CLERK	Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
M	BEN	Oh no.
M	ROOM CLERK	Sir?
M	BEN	I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
M	ROOM CLERK	Of course.
M	ROOM CLERK	I'll have a porter show you the room.
M	BEN	Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.

M	BEN	Thank you.
M	WAITER NO. 1	Mrs. Robinson.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes?

F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes?
M	BEN'S VOICE	Benjamin Braddock.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- where are you?
M	BEN'S VOICE	Can you look through the glass.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Can you see me now?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes, I can.
M	BEN	I got a single room.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	That's fine.
M	BEN	But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well -- do you want to go up first?
M	BEN	Yes -- I think that would be good.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I'll be up in five minutes.
M	BEN	Well -- goodbye then --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin.
M	BEN	Yes?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Isn't there something you want to tell me?
M	BEN	To tell you?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
M	BEN	Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	The number.
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
M	BEN	Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
M	BEN	You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
M	BEN	I've got it.
M	BEN	I say I've got it.
M	CLERK	Sir?
M	BEN	The toothbrush. I got it all right.
M	CLERK	Very good, sir.
M	BEN	Yes. Well -- goodnight.
M	CLERK	Goodnight, sir.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well?
M	BEN	Well.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin.
M	BEN	Yes?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
M	BEN	Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Why don't you watch?
M	BEN	Oh -- sure. Thank you.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Will you bring me a hanger?
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	A hanger.
M	BEN	Oh -- yes. Wood?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	Wood or wire? They have both.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Either one will be fine.
M	BEN	Okay.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Will you help me with this, please?
M	BEN	Certainly.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
M	BEN	You're welcome.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Would this be easier for you in the dark?
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	You what?
M	BEN	This is all terribly wrong.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
M	BEN	Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Are you afraid of me?
M	BEN	No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, is this your first time?
M	BEN	Is this -- what?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
M	BEN	That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	You can admit that, can't you?
M	BEN	Are you kidding?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	It's nothing to be ashamed of --
M	BEN	Wait a minute!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	On your first time --
M	BEN	Who said it was my first time?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	That you're afraid --
M	BEN	Wait a minute.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
M	BEN	INADEQUATE!
M	BEN	Don't move.
M	MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE	Ben -- what are you doing?
M	BEN'S VOICE	Well -- I would say that I'm just drifting.
M	BEN	-- here -- in the pool.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Why?
M	BEN	Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Have you thought about graduate school?
M	BEN	No.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
M	BEN	You got me.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	The Robinson's are here.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
M	BEN	Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
F	MR. ROBINSON	That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
M	BEN	I will.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Hello, Benjamin.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Can I talk to you a minute?
M	BEN	Sure.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
M	BEN	When I go off?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
M	BEN	No, I do. I want to tell you.
M	BEN	I drive around.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	What else?
M	BEN	Nothing else.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Oh, no.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
M	BEN	Meet someone?
M	BEN	Why did you say that?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
M	BEN	No wait. Wait.
M	BEN	I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Well, wait.
M	BEN	You think I'm being dishonest?
M	BEN	Well why do you -- why do you think that?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
M	BEN	Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Not if you don't want to.
M	BEN	I do.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	But I don't want you to make up something.
M	BEN	I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Goodnight, Benjamin.
M	BEN	You believe me, don't you?
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	No.
M	BEN	You don't?
M	BEN	But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Goodnight.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Wait a minute.
M	BEN	Wait a minute. Sit down a minute.
M	BEN	Will you please sit down a minute.
M	BEN	Will you leave that shoe on for a minute. Please.
M	BEN	Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	If you want.
M	BEN	Good. I mean are we dead or something?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
M	BEN	All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Are you tired of it?
M	BEN	I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well what do you want to talk about?
M	BEN	Anything. Anything at all.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
M	BEN	Oh my God.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well?
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
M	BEN	Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	How about art.
M	BEN	Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
M	BEN	Oh.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't you?
M	BEN	Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Go ahead then.
M	BEN	Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
M	BEN	Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Neither.
M	BEN	You're not interested in art?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	Then why do you want to talk about it?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Can I take off my clothes now?
M	BEN	No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do you really want me to?
M	BEN	Yes I do.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I got up.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to hear it or not?
M	BEN	Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
M	BEN	What one.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	What novel did you read.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't remember.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
M	BEN	There!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Him?
M	BEN	I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	There isn't any.
M	BEN	There's no risk?
M	BEN	How do you get out of the house?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I walk out.
M	BEN	You walk right out the door.
M	BEN	What do you say to him?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	He's asleep.
M	BEN	Always?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
M	BEN	Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
M	BEN	But what about the noise from the car. What if --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	The driveway's on my side of the house.
M	BEN	We're talking.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Calm down, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Now let's keep going here.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Can I undress and talk at the same time?
M	BEN	Right.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
M	BEN	Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	We don't.
M	BEN	So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No we don't.
M	BEN	Well how long has this been going on.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	About five years.
M	BEN	Oh no. Are you kidding me?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	You have not slept with your husband for five years?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
M	BEN	How many times a year.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
M	BEN	Man, is this interesting.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Is it?
M	BEN	So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	We've talked enough, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Not exactly.
M	BEN	But you don't hate him.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
M	BEN	Well how do you feel about him, then?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't.
M	BEN	Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Is it?
M	BEN	I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
M	BEN	Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	What?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
M	BEN	Well, wait a minute. You married him.
M	BEN	Why did you do that?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	See if you can guess.
M	BEN	Well I can't.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Think real hard, Benjamin.
M	BEN	I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't tell Elaine.
M	BEN	Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Are you shocked?
M	BEN	Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
F	MRS. ROBINSON	All right. Now let's get to bed.
M	BEN	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Not particularly.
M	BEN	Was he a law student at the time?
M	BEN	And you were a student also.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
M	BEN	At college.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
M	BEN	What was your major?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Why are you asking me all this?
M	BEN	Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Art.
M	BEN	Art?
M	BEN	But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Kind of.
M	BEN	Well how did it happen?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	How do you think.
M	BEN	I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
M	BEN	I'm curious.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	We'd go to his car.
M	BEN	Oh no. In the car you did it?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't think we were the first.
M	BEN	What kind of car was it?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	Do you remember the make of the car?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Oh my God.
M	BEN	Really. I want to know.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	It was a Ford, Benjamin.
M	BEN	A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	That's enough.
M	BEN	So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't talk about Elaine.
M	BEN	Don't talk about Elaine?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	Why not?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Because I don't want you to.
M	BEN	Well why don't you?
M	BEN	I wish you'd tell me.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	There's nothing to tell.
M	BEN	Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
M	BEN	Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do you understand that?
M	BEN	Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Good.
M	BEN	I was just kidding around.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Good.
M	BEN	But why shouldn't I?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I have my reasons.
M	BEN	Then let's hear them.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	No.
M	BEN	Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
M	BEN	I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Let's drop it.
M	BEN	We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin?
M	BEN	I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
M	BEN	You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I wouldn't know.
M	BEN	Well, I'm not.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	You're not.
M	BEN	No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I see.
M	BEN	And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
M	BEN	Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Are you?
M	BEN	You're goddamn right I am.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	That's how you feel about me.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
M	BEN	Now don't start this.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	What?
M	BEN	Don't start acting hurt.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Did I say that?
M	BEN	Of course you did.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
M	BEN	Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
M	BEN	You wouldn't.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Of course I wouldn't.
M	BEN	What are you doing?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
M	BEN	Well look -- I was kind of upset there. I'm sorry I said those things.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	If that's how you feel --
M	BEN	But it's not.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
M	BEN	Oh no. Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	But if it's sickening for you --
M	BEN	It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	You don't have to say that.
M	BEN	Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	May I stay then?
M	BEN	Yes. Please. I want you to.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
M	BEN	Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you? I want you to promise me that.
M	BEN	Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Then give me your word you won't.
M	BEN	This is absurd.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Promise me, Benjamin.
M	BEN	All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you. Benjamin --
M	BEN	Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Elaine's back from school. I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Don't you think that she's a terribly attractive girl? Because I think she's one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
M	BEN	Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
M	BEN	Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
M	BEN	That has nothing to do with it --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
M	BEN	I do.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
M	BEN	I'll go call Elaine now.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Well, Braddock -- it's about time you got around to this. Come on in. I'm afraid the young lady isn't quite ready yet --
M	BEN	Hello.
F	MR. ROBINSON	What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
M	BEN	Yes.
F	MR. ROBINSON	I'll see if she's ready.
M	BEN	Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
M	BEN	Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
M	MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Hey -- there she is. Miss America -- that's who it is. It's definitely Miss America.
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	Daddy -- can you fix this? The clasp is broken I think.
M	MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE	I'll do it -- I'll do it.
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	Is Ben here?
M	MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE	He's in the living room having a chat with your mother.
F	ELAINE	Hello.
M	BEN	Hello.
M	MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Well -- I want you to keep your wits about you tonight. You never know what tricks Ben picked up back there in the East.
F	ELAINE	You're living at home now. Is that right?
M	BEN	Yes.
F	ELAINE	Do you know what you're going to do?
M	BEN	No.
F	ELAINE	Are you going to graduate school?
M	BEN	No.
F	ELAINE	Do you always drive like this?
M	BEN	Yes.
M	BEN	Do you want some dinner?
F	ELAINE	I'd love some.
M	BEN	Bring a menu.
M	WAITER #2	Dinner for two, sir?
M	BEN	No. Just for her.
F	ELAINE	Aren't you eating?
M	BEN	No.
F	ELAINE	Why not?
M	BEN	If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
F	ELAINE	I've changed my mind. Thank you.
M	BEN	Sit down.
M	BEN	Why don't you watch the show?
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
M	BEN	No -- why should I?
F	ELAINE	I don't know.
M	BEN	You're missing a great effect here.
M	BEN	How do you like that?
M	BEN	Could you do it?
F	ELAINE	No.
M	STRIPPER	Hey!
M	BEN	Elaine -- I'm sorry.
F	ELAINE	Will you take me home now?
M	BEN	I'm sorry I took you in there.
F	ELAINE	I think I'd better go home now please.
M	BEN	But, Elaine --
F	ELAINE	Where is the car?
M	BEN	I just want to tell you something.
F	ELAINE	I want to go home.
M	BEN	But could I just tell you this one thing?
F	ELAINE	What?
M	BEN	This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
F	ELAINE	Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
M	BEN	No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
M	BEN	Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
F	ELAINE	No, I couldn't.
M	BEN	But could you try?
F	ELAINE	No.
M	BEN	Elaine --
F	ELAINE	Not here. Not here.
M	BEN	I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
F	ELAINE	Yes, I do.
M	BEN	It's like I've been playing some kind of -- game -- but the rules don't make any sense to me --
M	BEN	-- they're being made up by all the wrong people -- no -- I mean no one makes them up, they seem to have made themselves up.
M	BEN	Say -- I wonder if I could request you to turn that down a little?
F	ELAINE	Well -- maybe I'd better go in.
F	ELAINE	Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
M	BEN	No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
F	ELAINE	We won't. Let's go inside.
M	BEN	Wait a minute.
F	ELAINE	Is anything wrong?
M	BEN	No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
F	ELAINE	All right.
F	ELAINE	Where we going?
M	BEN	I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
F	ELAINE	Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
F	ELAINE	What is the matter?
M	BEN	Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
M	BEN	Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
F	ELAINE	Veranda Room -- right there.
M	CAR PARKER	Good evening.
M	BELLBOY	Hello, how are you, sir?
M	ROOM CLERK	Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.
M	VOICE #1	Hello again.
M	VOICE #2	Hi, Mr. Gladstone. How are you this evening?
F	ELAINE	Benjamin --
M	BEN	Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- do they know you?
M	BEN	Of course not.
M	VOICE #3	Good evening, sir.
M	VOICE #4	Mr. Gladstone -- how are you?
M	BEN	Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.
F	ELAINE	Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
M	BEN	I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
M	MISS DEWITTE	Hello, Mr. Brannif.
M	BEN	Elaine -- I like you. I like you so much. Do you believe that?
M	BEN	Do you?
F	ELAINE	Yes.
M	BEN	You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
M	BEN	I mean my whole life is such a waste. It's just nothing. I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- are having an affair with someone?
F	ELAINE	I'm sorry.
F	ELAINE	I'm sorry. That is not my business.
M	BEN	It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
F	ELAINE	Was she married or something?
M	BEN	Yes.
F	ELAINE	With a family?
M	BEN	Yes. She had a husband and a son.
F	ELAINE	Did they ever find out?
M	BEN	No.
F	ELAINE	And it's all over now.
M	BEN	Yes.
F	ELAINE	I'm glad. Can we do something tomorrow?
F	ELAINE	All right.
M	BEN	During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
F	ELAINE	Okay.
M	BEN	You sure you really want to?
F	ELAINE	Yes.
M	BEN	Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
F	ELAINE	I do.
M	BEN	You do?
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- I really do.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Drive down the block.
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Do exactly what I say.
M	BEN	Now it seems to me --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson --
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I can makes things quite unpleasant.
M	BEN	How?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
M	BEN	I don't believe you.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Then you'd better start believing me.
M	BEN	Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Go home now.
M	BEN	I just don't believe you would do that.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Try me.
M	BEN	Elaine!
M	BEN	Elaine?
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	Benjamin?
M	BEN	I'm coming up.
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	I'm not dressed yet.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- I said I wasn't dressed --
F	ELAINE	What's the matter?
M	BEN	You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- what's happening?
M	BEN	Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
M	BEN	NO.
M	BEN	Why aren't you ready?
F	ELAINE	Because I want to know what's happening.
M	BEN	There isn't time!
M	BEN	Elaine -- I have to tell you something.
F	ELAINE	What is it?
M	BEN	That woman --
F	ELAINE	What?
M	BEN	That woman. The older woman.
F	ELAINE	You mean the one who --
M	BEN	Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
F	ELAINE	What are you telling me?
F	ELAINE	Please -- will somebody tell me --
F	ELAINE	Oh -- no.
M	BEN	Elaine --
F	ELAINE	Oh my God --
M	BEN	Please.
M	BEN	No -- don't cry --
F	ELAINE	
M	BEN	Don't cry.
F	ELAINE	Get out of here.
F	ELAINE	Get out!
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Goodbye, Benjamin.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Say that again.
M	BEN	I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Well -- well -- well --
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	What's happening?
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	I don't believe it.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	That what he says. Right?
M	BEN	I'm going up to Berkeley today.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
M	BEN	No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	They don't know?
M	BEN	No -- they don't.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	Well -- when did you decide all this?
M	BEN	About an hour ago.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
M	BEN	No. She doesn't know about it.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
M	BEN	No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	When did you two talk this over?
M	BEN	We haven't.
F	MR. BRADDOCK	Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
M	BEN	No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
F	MRS. BRADDOCK	But what makes you think she wants to marry you?
M	BEN	She doesn't. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Dear Elaine -- I am now visiting Berkeley, after growing somewhat weary of family life. I have been meaning to stop by and pay my respects but am not entirely certain just how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and your mother. It was certainly a serious mistake on my part but not serious enough. I hope --
M	BEN'S VOICE	Mr. and Mrs. G. L. Robinson take great pleasure in announcing the wedding of their daughter...
M	BEN'S VOICE	Honey -- I'm home.
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	Hi -- Sweetheart.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Where are the kids?
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	Oh, they're having a wonderful time -- spending the day at Mother's -- she's teaching them to...
M	BEN'S VOICE	Dear Mom and Dad. You may have wondered why Elaine and I haven't written in such a long time, but the postal system here in Greenland isn't the most efficient. Life among these wonderful natives...
M	MAN'S VOICE	Do you, Benjamin Braddock take this woman, Mrs. Robinson, for your Mother- in-law, to love, cherish and...
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Benjamin -- you and Elaine have made such a wonderful marriage. I often laugh when I remember those nights at the Taft.
M	BEN'S VOICE	Yes -- how long ago that all seems.
M	MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	I'll never forget how peeved I was when I first...
M	LADY RECEPTIONIST NO. 1	May I help you?
M	BEN	Elaine Robinson.
M	LADY RECEPTIONIST NO. 1	Yes?
M	BEN	Elaine Robinson. Does she live here?
M	LADY RECEPTIONIST NO. 1	Three-oh-eight. Shall I call her for you?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	You a student?
M	BEN	Not exactly.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	What's that?
M	BEN	I said -- not exactly -- no.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	What are you then?
M	BEN	Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
M	BEN	Ahhh.
M	BEN	I'm not up too much, actually, I'm just visiting. I mean -- I've always wanted to see Berkeley.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	You're not one of those agitators?
M	BEN	What?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	One of those outside agitators.
M	BEN	Oh -- no sir.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	I hate that. I won't stand for it.
M	BEN	Elaine. Hey -- what a surprise. Say -- I thought I remembered that you were going to school up here -- well -- we'll have to get together sometime -- I'll be up here myself for a little while.
M	BEN	-- it certainly has been nice -- I think I'm late -- yes, I am --
M	BEN'S VOICE	Excuse me -- I'm sorry -- I wonder if I could get by -- excuse me --
M	BEN'S VOICE	Well -- how about this for a coincidence.
M	BEN	I was wondering where you were headed.
F	ELAINE	I'm meeting someone.
M	BEN	Ah. Where?
M	BEN	Where are you meeting this person?
F	ELAINE	At the Zoo.
M	BEN	The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
F	ELAINE	I've never been to it.
M	BEN	Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
M	BEN	Is that him over there?
F	ELAINE	No.
M	BEN	Where did he say he was going to meet you?
F	ELAINE	I thought he said by the monkey house.
M	BEN	Oh.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
M	BEN	Here? In Berkeley?
F	ELAINE	Yes.
M	BEN	Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
F	ELAINE	But you're not enrolled.
M	BEN	No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
M	BEN	Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
F	ELAINE	-- really incredible --
M	BEN	Here he comes.
F	ELAINE	What?
M	BEN	I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
M	CARL	Elaine!
M	BEN	He certainly is a good walker.
M	CARL	Am I late? I'm sorry.
M	BEN	We thought you said by the monkey house.
F	ELAINE	This is Benjamin Braddock. Carl Smith. Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.
M	CARL	Glad to meet you, Ben.
M	BEN	Great meeting you, Carl.
M	BEN	Swell seeing you. Have a good time.
M	BEN	Come in.
F	ELAINE	I want to ask you a question.
M	BEN	Come in.
F	ELAINE	No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
M	BEN	Because -- I am.
F	ELAINE	Is it because I'm here?
M	BEN	What do you think?
F	ELAINE	I think it is.
F	ELAINE	I said I think it is.
M	BEN	All right then! Yes!
F	ELAINE	Well, I want you to leave.
M	BEN	Elaine -- I love you.
F	ELAINE	How could you do that, Benjamin?
F	ELAINE	Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
M	BEN	What?
F	ELAINE	I don't understand --
M	BEN	Did you say rape her?
F	ELAINE	-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
M	BEN	What did she say?
F	ELAINE	Let me go.
M	BEN	You've got to tell me what she said.
F	ELAINE	Why?
M	BEN	Because it isn't true.
F	ELAINE	I don't feel well.
M	BEN	Tell me.
F	ELAINE	She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
M	BEN	Then what?
F	ELAINE	Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
M	BEN	Elaine -- that is not what happened.
F	ELAINE	Please let me go.
M	BEN	All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
F	ELAINE	Don't tell me --
M	BEN	-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- this is my mother!
M	BEN	-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
M	MR. MCCLEERY'S VOICE	What's going on in there?
M	BEN	Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	Who screamed?
M	BEN	It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
M	BEN	It was just a visitor. But it's all right now. What did you do to her?
M	BEN	Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
M	A BOY	Shall I get the cops?
M	BEN	What?
M	A BOY	I'll get the cops.
M	BEN	Hey -- wait a minute. Now damn it -- look.
M	BEN	See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
M	BEN	No, sir.
M	MR. MCCLEERY	I want you out of here.
M	BEN	Mr. McCleery?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	You heard me. Out of here.
M	BEN	What for?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	Because I don't like you.
F	ELAINE	I'm sorry I screamed.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
M	BEN	Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
F	ELAINE	Can I just sit here while you're packing?
M	BEN	If you want.
F	ELAINE	What are you looking for?
M	BEN	My belt.
F	ELAINE	
M	BEN	No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.
F	ELAINE	The marble?
M	BEN	The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
F	ELAINE	Oh.
F	ELAINE	What are you going to do now?
M	BEN	I don't know.
F	ELAINE	Are you going home?
M	BEN	No.
F	ELAINE	Well -- where are you going?
M	BEN	Elaine -- you're going to have to stop asking me that.
F	ELAINE	I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
M	BEN	I don't understand.
F	ELAINE	I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
M	BEN	But Elaine --
F	ELAINE	Goodbye.
M	BEN	What's happening?
F	ELAINE	Benjamin?
M	BEN	What?
F	ELAINE	Will you kiss me!
M	BEN	Will you marry me?
M	BEN	You won't?
F	ELAINE	I don't know.
M	BEN	But you might.
F	ELAINE	I might.
M	BEN	Is that so? You might marry me?
F	ELAINE	Yes.
M	BEN	
F	ELAINE	I don't know.
M	BEN	How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
F	ELAINE	I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
M	BEN	You mean you're confused?
M	BEN	Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
F	ELAINE	I don't see how we can.
M	BEN	We just can.
F	ELAINE	I have to go back now.
M	BEN	Elaine -- are you serious about this?
F	ELAINE	I'll think about it.
M	BEN	You really will?
F	ELAINE	Yes.
M	BEN	Well -- let's get together sometime.
M	BEN	Good God! OR SERIOUS REPEAT SERIOUS TROUBLE WILL RESULT. MRS. G. L. ROBINSON
M	BEN	We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
F	ELAINE	Tomorrow?
M	BEN	for it.
F	ELAINE	Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
M	BEN	We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
F	ELAINE	I just don't think it would work.
M	BEN	Why wouldn't it?
M	BEN	Why wouldn't it?
F	ELAINE	I just don't think it would...
M	BEN	Tomorrow then -- can we get our blood tests tomorrow morning?
F	ELAINE	Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
M	BEN	Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
F	ELAINE	Well -- I have to see Carl first.
M	BEN	Carl who?
M	BEN	Carl who?
F	ELAINE	Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
M	BEN	Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
F	ELAINE	Yes.
M	BEN	Why do you have to see him?
F	ELAINE	Well -- I said I might marry him.
M	BEN	You WHAT?
M	BEN	How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
F	ELAINE	No, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
F	ELAINE	He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
M	BEN	Oh no. He said that.
F	ELAINE	Shhhh.
M	BEN	Where did he do it?
M	BEN	I'd like to know where it happened?
M	BEN	It wasn't in his car, was it?
M	BEN	Are we getting married tomorrow?
F	ELAINE	No.
M	BEN	The day after tomorrow?
F	ELAINE	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
M	BEN	Mr. Robinson?
F	MR. ROBINSON	Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
M	BEN	No, it's not --
F	MR. ROBINSON	Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
M	BEN	It was nothing to do with you, sir.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
M	BEN	Now look -- please --
F	MR. ROBINSON	Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
M	BEN	I am not threatening you.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
M	BEN	I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
F	MR. ROBINSON	You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
M	BEN	No, I don't.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
M	BEN	But why?
F	MR. ROBINSON	Why?
M	BEN	It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
F	MR. ROBINSON	That's quite a statement.
M	BEN	Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
M	BEN	You miss the point.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Don't shout at me, Ben.
M	BEN	The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
F	MR. ROBINSON	Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
M	BEN	HUH?
F	MR. ROBINSON	I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent insure...
F	MR. ROBINSON	Stay away from me, Ben!
F	MR. ROBINSON	I don't want to mince words with you. As far as Elaine's concerned you're to get her out of your filthy mind right now. Is that perfectly clear to you? That's all, Ben. You'll pardon me if I don't shake hands with you.
F	MR. ROBINSON	I think you are filth.
F	MR. ROBINSON	I think you are scum.
F	MR. ROBINSON	You are a degenerate!
M	BEN	Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	I want you out of here.
M	BEN	Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	I am going to call the police now.
M	BEN	Could I make one phone call first?
M	MR. MCCLEERY	Get out!
M	LADY RECEPTIONIST #2	Elaine Robinson has left the school.
M	LADY RECEPTIONIST #2	Her roommate is coming down with a note for you.
M	ELAINE'S VOICE	Dear Benjamin -- I promise you some day I will write a long letter about everything but right now I can't think and all I can say to you is please forgive me because I know what I'm doing is the best thing for you. My father is so upset you've got to understand. I love you, but it would never work out.
M	BEN	Elaine -- Elaine --
M	BEN	Elaine?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Hello, Benjamin.
M	BEN	Where is she?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Hello. Get me the police, please.
M	BEN	Where is Elaine?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin. Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him. Are you armed? No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
M	BEN	What have you done to her?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
M	BEN	You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
M	BEN	What the hell have you done?
F	MRS. ROBINSON	Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
M	BEN	I'll find her.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	I don't think so.
M	BEN	Wedding! God Damn it -- wedding!
M	MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Carl -- I think you and Elaine will make a good team.
M	CARL'S VOICE	Your father's right, Elaine. You and I will make a darned good team.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	We have two Carl Smiths. Is it Carl with a "C" or a "K"?
M	BEN'S VOICE	I'm afraid I don't know.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	The Karl Smith with a "K" teaches History of Advertising --
M	BEN'S VOICE	And the other?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	The one with the "C", Carl Smith Junior, is in our medical school. He lives at Gamma Delta Tau.
M	BEN	Say -- fellows --
M	BEN	Do any of you fellows know where Carl Smith is?
M	FRAT BROTHER #1	He took off in the middle of the night to get married.
M	FRAT BROTHER #2	Probably one step ahead of the shotgun.
M	BEN	getting married? I'm supposed to be there.
M	FRAT BROTHER #2	Why don't you ask Carter?
M	BEN	Would you happen to know where I might find him?
M	FRAT BROTHER #2	He's probably still in the sack. He's always in the sack.
M	FRAT BROTHER #3	Or in the can.
M	MAN AT SINK	Hey, Carter -- where's the Make Out King getting married?
M	CARTER'S VOICE	Santa Barbara.
M	BEN	You don't happen to know exactly where the Make Out King is getting married, do you? I'm supposed to be there.
M	CARTER'S VOICE	I don't know. Maybe at his old man's home.
M	MAN AT SINK	You going to the wedding?
M	BEN	Yes.
M	MAN AT SINK	Give the bride a message for me. Tell her to act surprised.
M	BEN	Do you have a phone?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	
M	BEN	Hello -- who is this?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
M	BEN	Is the doctor anywhere?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
M	BEN	Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Oh. Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
M	BEN	Thank you.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	I certainly hope you --
M	BEN	Allan Street. Where is it?
M	ATTENDANT	Six blocks up -- three blocks over. You need any gas, Father?
M	BEN	I'm not a priest -- I'm a minister.
M	BEN	Oh, Jesus -- God -- no --
M	BEN	No!
M	BEN	Elaine -- Elaine!
M	CARL	Who is that guy? What's he doing?
F	MR. ROBINSON	I'll take care of him.
F	MRS. ROBINSON	He's too late.
F	ELAINE	Ben!
M	BEN	Come on -- don't faint.
M	BEN	Out of my way! Elaine -- it's too late.
F	ELAINE	Not for me.
M	BEN	MOVE!
M	BEN	Run, Elaine, run!
M	BEN	How much?
M	DRIVER	Where do you want to go?
M	BEN	To the end.
M	BEN	Let's go. Let's get this bus moving!
F	ELAINE	Benjamin?
M	BEN	What?
