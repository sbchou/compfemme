M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	Story by	KENNETH LONERGAN and PETER TOLAN PURPOSES ONLY 1957 was a big year. The Russians put that Sputnik into outer space, the Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot Frank Costello in the head, and missed, and the Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barber shop in the Park Sheraton Hotel. It was total chaos. With Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese figures he's king shit, but Carlo Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both want to be boss of all bosses. So they call a meeting -- a big meeting.
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	It was the first time the whole commission was ever gonna meet face to face. Bosses and wiseguys were comin' in from all over the country, and all the New York families, too -- maybe sixty bosses, the whole wiseguy world -- all headin' toward this little town upstate to figure out what's what.
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	Your father and me, we were goin' up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.
M	MANETTA (V.O.CONT'D)	He was running the family at the time. Anyway, I don't know what anybody was thinking, but some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting at Joe Babara's farm in the country where nobody would notice.
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	Turns out the local cops were watching Joe Babara like a hawk. So now you got about fifty Caddies and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin and some deputy sheriff with cow shit on his shoes notices all the traffic and calls the Feds.
M	WISEGUY	You wanna be a ribeye? Get away from the fuckin' car.
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	The meeting never even got started. The Feds moved in --
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	-- and we moved out.
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	Your papa and me hid in a field with hay or corn, some kinda foliage, I don't know.
M	MANETTA (V.O.)	Then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor, so your father hauls out his piece, this .44 cannon he used to carry, and hijacks the goddamn tractor. Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.
M	MANETTA	Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now.
F	VITTI	I don't know. I don't like it. What do we need a meeting for? Let everybody worry about their own business.
M	MANETTA	The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. This meeting is about how we're gonna survive. You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with. Everything's changing. We need a leader. Someone with fresh ideas. Someone like you. It's gonna be a new century, Paul. We gotta change with the times.
F	VITTI	What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site?
M	MANETTA	You remember what else happened in 1957, Paul?
F	VITTI	Yeah, I remember.
M	MANETTA	When your father died, I promised him I'd always look out for you. Come to the meeting.
F	VITTI	Wait a second. I'm just gonna grab a toothpick.
F	CAROLINE	I kept telling him that I needed room to grow and find myself as a person. Not just as a woman but as an independent entity.
F	CAROLINE	I told him I needed to get in touch with my uniqueness, but he couldn't handle that. He said I was driving him away. Do you think I was driving him away, Dr. Sobol?
M	BEN	Things end, Caroline. That's just a part of life. It's how we deal with things ending that's important.
F	CAROLINE	I just can't believe it's over between me and Steve. Maybe there's still hope.
M	BEN	Well, he did take out a restraining order against you. I have to be honest, that's usually not a good sign.
F	CAROLINE	But what should I do?
M	BEN	Well, Caroline, I think the first thing you have to do... ... is stop whining about this pathetic loser! You're a tragedy queen! 'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives a shit! Get a fucking life! You are, without a doubt, the most boring human being I have ever met! Please, say something interesting before I lapse into a goddamn coma!
F	CAROLINE	Dr. Sobol?
M	BEN	Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting on your whole -- situation. It's very interesting what you were just saying. I want you to think about it, and I'm going to think about it, so we'll both think about it and we'll continue next week when I get back from my vacation.
M	BEN	Or not.
M	MICHAEL	You're late.
M	BEN	I know. I couldn't get rid of my last patient. I think she was a tick in a past life.
M	MICHAEL	Yeah, what's Caroline's problem? Your boyfriend's gone, he hates your guts, get over it.
M	BEN	Michael! What did I tell you? You can't listen to my sessions! It's private stuff.
M	MICHAEL	I can't help it. I hear you through the vent in my room.
M	BEN	Funny how that happens when you lie on the floor and put your ear up against it.
M	MICHAEL	Okay, okay. How's that guy who dreams about shitting trout?
M	BEN	Fine. He moved up to striped bass. Put on your cummerbund. Boy, have you grown. Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant?
M	MICHAEL	Why do we have to wear rented clothes to Grandpa's party? This blows.
M	BEN	We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable. Forget the tux. Regular clothes.
M	MICHAEL	Are you ambivalent about Grandpa Isaac?
M	BEN (O.S.)	Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff?
M	MICHAEL	Mom.
M	BEN	She's not supposed to do that, you know.
M	BEN (CONT'D)	Your mother and I, when we got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't put you in the middle, or use you as a go-between to talk about each other. So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth. Did she say anything about me getting married again? I think she could be feeling a little anger about it.
M	MICHAEL	Oh, yeah. She really cares. She says you're intimidated by women your own age, and that's why you go for these young babes.
M	BEN	Okay. Listen, for two seconds, pretend I'm not your father. I'm just some guy, okay?
M	MICHAEL	You gonna vent?
M	BEN	Yeah. I hate her! I really hate her! Okay. Dad again. Let's go.
F	VITTI	So what did you find out?
M	JELLY	The word is Primo Sindone must have ordered it, but, uh --
F	VITTI	What?
F	VITTI	What?
M	JELLY	A lot of people think you set him up.
F	VITTI	Why the fuck would I want to kill Dominic? He was like a father to me.
M	JELLY	So you could be the big boss. Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting.
F	VITTI	Oh, is that what they figure?
M	JELLY	It's alright with me if you did --
F	VITTI	I didn't kill him! I told you that! Don't you hear?
M	NICKY	Please, Mr. Vitti, I told 'em I don't know anything but they don't believe me 'cause that one time I said Little Joe hit Dukey and it turned out he didn't but I didn't know because --
M	JIMMY	Shut the fuck up!
F	VITTI	Nicky, you know me, right?
M	NICKY	Yeah. You're Mr. Vitti.
F	VITTI	And you know what I'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right?
M	NICKY	Uh, you're gonna crack me on the head with that pipe?
M	JIMMY	It's a rhetorical question, you fuckin' idiot.
F	VITTI	I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Who killed Dominic Manetta?
M	NICKY	I don't know.
F	VITTI	Don't fuckin' lie to me!
M	NICKY	Honest to God, I don't know!
F	VITTI	You little rat bastard...
F	VITTI	Forget about it. He doesn't know anything.
F	VITTI	Get him outta here.
M	BEN	Look at this. Everybody's nuts. Ooh, I hate walking into that house late.
M	MICHAEL	I think you're reacting like this because you're mad we have to go to this party.
M	BEN	No. Don't. I'm not going to be analyzed by someone who up until a few years ago believed in Santa. Sorry, but we only have room for one Dr. Sobol in this family.
M	MICHAEL	But there's two Dr. Sobols. There's you and Grandpa.
M	BEN	Can we talk about something else?
M	MICHAEL	Are you going to read Grandpa's new book? Mom says you won't because you're...
M	BEN	Does your mother talk about anything else or is it just me twenty-four hours a day?
M	BEN	That's your mother's fault! Your mother did that! Damn!
M	JIMMY	What's the matter with you? Are you some kind of moron?
M	BEN	I'm sorry. It's totally my fault.
M	JIMMY	Did you see anything?
M	BEN	I was talking to my son. I took my eyes off the road --
M	JIMMY	Forget that bullshit. Did you see anything?
M	JELLY	That's all right, sir. It's our fault for being in front of you like that.
M	BEN	Well, I should have been watching. Let me give you my insurance information --
M	JELLY	It's okay. Forget about it.
M	BEN	Really? It looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up.
M	JELLY	No, it was like that before.
M	BEN	Maybe we should call the police?
M	JELLY	Why? Fuck the police.
M	BEN	Right! Fuck 'em.
M	BEN	At least take my card. You might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind.
M	JELLY	You're a doctor?
M	BEN	Ph.D. Psychologist.
M	JELLY	A shrink. You talk to a lotta nuts, huh?
M	JELLY	Pings and knocks. Cheap gas. Hey, how do those minivans handle?
M	JIMMY (O.S.)	Jelly! Let's go!
M	JELLY	Take it easy, Doc.
M	ISAAC	All right, neurotics only! Well, you must have been a beautiful ba-a-by, 'cause baby look at you now, thank God for Prozac, baby look at you now!
M	BEN	What do you mean you're not coming? It's my wedding.
F	DOROTHY	We understand it's a special day for you, Benny, but your father and I can't just pick up and leave town every time you decide to get married.
M	BEN	Every time? This is a once-in-a- -- twice-in-a-lifetime thing.
M	BEN	Dad, you're not coming to my wedding?
M	ISAAC	We want to be there, but I have three book signings next weekend. I can't piss off these big book stores. If I cancel, they'll stick me down on the bottom shelf. That's how they are.
M	BEN	Yeah, that's the word on the street. The self-help book business is full of vindictive pricks.
F	DOROTHY	Ben! The language.
M	BEN	I'm sorry, but I've been alone for eight years, now I've finally met someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and I would really like you to meet her before we get married. You're going to be her family. I think it's better she knows that up front.
M	ISAAC	You're really hostile tonight.
M	BEN	I'm joking.
F	DOROTHY	I think I'll go talk to the mayor.
M	BEN	The mayor's here?
F	DOROTHY	I can only hope.
M	ISAAC	What's wrong?
M	BEN	Nothing. Everything's fine.
M	ISAAC	How's your practice?
M	BEN	It's great. Just great. I've got some very interesting patients -- extremely interesting. Fascinating actually.
M	MICHAEL	Dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout.
M	BEN	Thanks, Mike.
M	ISAAC	Excuse us, Michael.
M	ISAAC	Why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks? New York City is the Mecca of Madness.
M	BEN	I'm just not sure I could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid.
M	ISAAC	It beats a guy with an ass full of flounder.
M	BEN	Trout! And don't minimize my practice.
M	ISAAC	Why are you getting so defensive? This is about your own feelings of inadequacy.
M	BEN	You always turn it back on me. Why do you do that?
M	ISAAC	Why do you think I do that?
M	BEN	Why do you think I think you do that? Go ahead, now you ask me why I think you think I think you do that.
M	ISAAC	Enough. I want you to think about what I said. And when you're ready to talk to me like a normal person, I'll be at the piano with Regis Philbin. Rege!
M	REGIS PHILBIN	I'm not singing, Isaac!
M	ISAAC	Now, ladies and gentlemen, at the piano, Regis Philbin!
M	BEN	Thomas Wolfe was right. You can't go home again -- because your parents still live there.
M	MASIELLO	The Manetta family is asking a lot of questions. They think we hit Dominic.
M	MANGANO	Forget Dominic! They were after Paul. It's a miracle you survived. I thank God.
F	VITTI	Yeah, thank God. All I know is if I didn't have some veal stuck in my teeth, I'd be laying there with Dominic.
M	JOHNNY BIGS	This is all about the big meeting. Primo Sindone wants to run the whole show.
M	MANGANO	Yeah, but Primo's a boss. He knows the rules. He couldn't go after Dominic and Paul unless the other families gave their permission.
F	VITTI	If they did, we're heading for one big fuckin' war. Talk to Zello and Baldassare. Find out what you can. We got two weeks. If the other New York bosses are against us, I want to know it before I walk into that meeting.
M	MANGANO	You all right, Paul? You don't look good.
F	VITTI	I'm a little choked up here. I gotta get some air.
M	JELLY	You feel all right?
F	VITTI	I feel like shit. This whole thing is like a huge fuckin' headache.
M	JELLY	You havin' one of those mindgrains?
F	VITTI	Get the car.
M	DOCTOR	Good news, Mr. Evans. Your heart is just fine.
F	VITTI	How could it be fine? I've had like eight heart attacks in the last three weeks.
M	DOCTOR	Well, based on everything, I'd say you probably had an anxiety attack.
F	VITTI	What?
M	DOCTOR	An anxiety attack. A panic attack. I can give you some Xanax if it happens again soon --
F	VITTI	Look at me. Do I look like a guy who panics?
M	DOCTOR	There's nothing -- I mean -- it's a common thing --
F	VITTI	Where did you go to medical school? I had a heart attack, you quack bastard.
M	DOCTOR	Well, not according to these --
F	VITTI	Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a mild heart attack and now it's over. You understand?
F	VITTI	If anyone asks you, you never saw me, and I was never here. Is that clear?
M	DOCTOR	Yes.
F	VITTI	Good. Take the chart.
F	VITTI	Jelly, I need you to do something for me as my friend.
M	JELLY	Anything.
F	VITTI	You have to find me a doctor.
M	JELLY	We just came from the doctor.
F	VITTI	Not that kind of doctor. I need a head doctor.
M	JELLY	You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black? Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig.
F	VITTI	Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud. Do I have to spell everything out?
M	JELLY	It saves time.
F	VITTI	I need you to find me a psychiatrist.
M	JELLY	Wow. This is like the Psychic Network or something. I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually he ran into me.
F	VITTI	Is he any good?
M	JELLY	Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy. He had a business card and everything --
F	VITTI	He had a card? That's a real fuckin' achievement. What do you need a shrink for anyway?
F	VITTI	It's not for me. It's for a friend. This friend is having some problems, so I'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend.
M	JELLY	Got it.
F	VITTI	And nobody can know. If anyone hears I'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way. You know what I mean?
M	JELLY	Of course. Absolutely. Can I ask you one thing?
F	VITTI	What?
M	JELLY	This friend. Is it me?
M	BEN	Carl, I'm detecting a pattern here. You seem to settle too easily for things.
M	CARL	You're right. I do.
M	BEN	No, well, there you go. You just did it again. I suggested something and you immediately agreed.
M	CARL	You're right. I did.
M	BEN	Why do you think you do that?
M	CARL	I don't know.
M	BEN	Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl. And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. Stand your ground. Don't let people roll over you.
M	JELLY	Dr. Sobol?
M	BEN	Excuse me! I'm in a session here.
M	JELLY	Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
M	BEN	You're... You're one of the guys I rear-ended the other night.
M	JELLY	Bingo. Get outta here.
M	JELLY	Upsa-daisy. You got a coat, nutbar?
M	BEN	What are you doing?
M	JELLY	He's leaving.
M	BEN	The hell he is. He's not going anywhere until we're done with his session.
M	JELLY	I'll give you a hundred bucks to get out of here.
M	BEN	Don't take it, Carl.
M	JELLY	A hundred and fifty.
M	BEN	He's not leaving.
M	CARL	Three hundred.
M	JELLY	You're not that fuckin' crazy.
M	BEN	Listen, if you're upset about your car, I can understand that. But you don't just barge in here --
F	VITTI	You know who I am?
M	BEN	Yes.
F	VITTI	No you don't.
M	BEN	Okay.
F	VITTI	You've seen my picture in the papers?
M	BEN	Yes. And no. Sometimes. Never.
F	VITTI	Jelly, wait outside.
F	VITTI	Sit down.
M	BEN	Sure.
F	VITTI	Tony Bennett, huh?
M	BEN	Yeah. He's my favorite.
M	BEN	Mr. Vitti, I tried to give the guy my insurance information, but he wouldn't take it. Seriously, I tried several times because it was all my please don't kill me.
F	VITTI	I was just gonna ask if you liked baseball.
M	BEN	Yes. Big Yankee fan.
M	BEN	Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your fault, but your friend, he interrupted a patient's session and that's -- not good. I think this is a matter for our insurance companies, don't you think?
F	VITTI	I don't care about the car.
M	BEN	Then what -- ?
F	VITTI	A friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink, so I'm going to ask you a couple questions. Do we sit?
M	BEN	Whatever makes you comfortable.
F	VITTI	Okay, the first thing I gotta know about is privacy. You must hear a lot of weird shit in here. How do I know you won't go testifying -- not testifying -- but, you know, talking about it to somebody else.
M	BEN	I won't discuss a patient with anyone for any reason, unless I know the patient may be a danger to himself. Like if I'm concerned a patient might kill himself...
F	VITTI	Not fuckin' likely --
M	BEN	-- or kill someone else.
F	VITTI	So who starts?
M	BEN	Why don't you tell me why you think you need therapy?
F	VITTI	I don't need therapy. I'm helping out my friend. You didn't hear me say that?
M	BEN	Right. I'm sorry.
F	VITTI	You guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening. You can't remember what I said two seconds ago.
M	BEN	I'm very sorry.
F	VITTI	I have to tell you, Doc, I'm not thrilled with the level of service up to this point.
M	BEN	Why don't you tell me about your friend?
F	VITTI	He's a powerful guy. Never had a problem dealing with things, you know? Now all of a sudden, he's falling apart. He cries for no reason. He's having trouble sleeping. And then he started having these attacks. You know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains -- like you think you're gonna die.
M	BEN	Panic attacks.
F	VITTI	What's with all you doctors and the fuckin' panic? Did I say panic?
M	BEN	Not panic. Dizzy -- breathing -- chest pain attacks.
F	VITTI	Right. So the question is, what can he do to make it stop?
M	BEN	I'm going to go out on a limb here. I think your friend is you.
F	VITTI	You -- you -- you -- you have a gift, my friend. Go on.
M	BEN	Medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy.
F	VITTI	With you?
M	BEN	With me? Oh, I don't know. I'd have to look at my schedule. I'm very heavily booked right now and I'm going on a short vacation tomorrow.
F	VITTI	Where you going?
M	BEN	I don't really share that information with...
F	VITTI	Where?
M	BEN	Miami Beach.
F	VITTI	You know, this could be good. Just getting that off my chest, I feel better already. It's like a load is off my shoulders. Thank you.
M	BEN	Well, I really didn't do anything --
F	VITTI	You did something. The load? Off. Where is it? Don't know. You're good, Doctor. I'll be in touch. But listen to me. If I talk to you and it turns me into a fag, I'll kill you. You understand?
M	BEN	Could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up --
F	VITTI	I go fag, you die. Got it?
M	BEN	Yes.
M	BEN	I hope you didn't leave any food in your room. I don't want to come home and find a science fair.
M	MICHAEL	I didn't. Hey, Dad? One thing though.
M	BEN	Yeah?
M	MICHAEL	I go fag, you die.
M	BEN	Michael! That's it! I am sealing that vent.
M	MICHAEL	You are so cool, Dad. Was that really Paul Vitti?
M	BEN	I didn't ask to see his Mafia decoder ring, but yeah, it was him. And you cannot tell anyone he was here. You understand?
M	MICHAEL	Should I take it off the internet?
M	BEN	What?
M	MICHAEL	I'm kidding!
F	LAURA	So judging from the mob scene around the pool here today, I think you'd have to say that there's nothing 'off' about the 'off-season' in Miami Beach this summer. Now, on a personal note, this is my last report for W.V.B.F. I'm getting married to a wonderful man and moving to New York, so if you're up that way, watch for me on the W.P.I.X. news team. Thanks for everything, Miami. For the last time, this is Laura MacNamara, W.V.B.F. news.
F	LAURA	Catch!
M	PRODUCER	We're clear.
F	LAURA	I'll do the re-asks, then you guys can just shoot the inserts and pack it up. Ben!
F	LAURA	This is him, everyone! This is the guy!
M	BEN	Hi, everybody.
F	LAURA	Oh, I missed you.
M	BEN	I missed you too. Michael, say hello.
M	MICHAEL	Hi, Laura.
F	LAURA	This is Michael? I don't think so. If I remember correctly, Michael was a little boy, and this, this is a great big kid. Hey, you. Tell us what you did with Michael Sobol.
F	LAURA	Okay. Come on. Give me a break. I'm trying.
M	MICHAEL	No, it was nice, but I'm fourteen so it wasn't -- you know -- age appropriate.
F	LAURA	Sorry. Just smack me if I do that again. How are you, Michael?
M	MICHAEL	Great.
M	BEN	Mike, you want to go look at the camera?
M	MICHAEL	Why would I want to look at the camera?
M	BEN	'Cause I bet there's all kinds of cool video stuff over there. Why don't you check it out?
M	MICHAEL	Oh, yeah. Is it okay?
F	LAURA	Go ahead. If you break something, don't worry. I'm out of here.
F	LAURA	You think he likes me?
M	BEN	Michael? He's crazy about you. I am too.
F	LAURA	You are? And you still really want to get married?
M	BEN	Of course.
F	LAURA	But what if you get tired of me? I know so many couples that were really happy, then they got married and just completely lost interest in each other.
M	BEN	That's not going to be us.
F	LAURA	I just don't want to lose the passion.
M	BEN	Yes, I'm brimming with passion. I'm up to here with passion.
F	LAURA	I want us to be like animals. You know just screaming and sweating and tearing at each other all the time --
M	BEN	The sweating shouldn't be a problem. The tearing sounds painful.
M	SOUND GUY	Uhh, Laura? You want me to take your mic, or at least turn it off?
F	LAURA	Oh my God.
M	SHEILA (O.S.)	Oh my God! Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
F	SHEILA	Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Is everything okay, Paul?
F	VITTI	What are you talking for? I'm trying to do this here.
F	SHEILA	You seem -- distracted.
F	VITTI	I got things on my mind. Stop talking.
F	SHEILA	Okay, I'm sorry. Just relax, baby.
F	SHEILA	Were you thinking about your wife?
F	VITTI	No, I wasn't thinking about my wife. Now I'm thinking about my wife. Goddamn it, Sheila, why can't you keep your mouth shut!
F	SHEILA	I'm sorry, Paul.
M	JELLY (O.S.)	Dr. Sobol. Dr. Sobol.
M	BEN	Mom?
M	JELLY	Mr. Vitti wants to see you. I have your robe.
M	VITTI (O.S.)	You no-good little two-bit piece of shit bastard!
F	VITTI	I got news for you. I'm still fucked up. Whatever you did the other day, it didn't take. You did nothing for me.
M	BEN	I did nothing? What did you expect? I saw you for five minutes. I don't work miracles, Mr. Vitti. And I'll tell you something else. I don't appreciate it when someone breaks into my hotel room and kidnaps me. I don't go for that. I have a family and a life and a serious practice, and I don't have time for your bullshit! That got away from me near the end.
F	VITTI	I couldn't get it up tonight.
M	BEN	You mean sexually?
F	VITTI	No, I mean for the big game against Michigan State. Of course sexually!
M	BEN	You flew fifteen hundred miles and dragged me out of bed in the middle of the night because you couldn't get an erection?
F	VITTI	Doesn't that prove I'm motivated?
M	BEN	You can take a pill for that, you know.
F	VITTI	No, that's a cheat. You start with the pills, next thing you know you got implants with pumps. I think a hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not at all.
M	BEN	Did you see that embroidered on a pillow somewhere?
F	VITTI	Are you gonna help me or not?
M	BEN	I don't believe this. All right. Has this happened before?
F	VITTI	The dead dick thing? Never. Well, one time. Tonight. And another time.
M	BEN	So twice?
F	VITTI	Do the math. Two times. There was another time. But it was after a big meal, so, you know, that don't count.
M	BEN	Listen, being unable to perform three or four times --
F	VITTI	Five.
M	BEN	Five times -- it isn't the end of the world.
F	VITTI	but if I can't get it up, that makes me less of a man and I can't have that.
M	VITTI (CONT'D)	In my business I deal with animals. They may seem dumb to an educated guy like you, but make no mistake about it, Doctor, animals are very cunning. And they sense weakness. Right now I'm an injured animal. It's only a matter of time before one of the lions out there catches the scent. Then I'm dead. That's the way it is. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand the life I live and you don't understand me.
M	BEN	Okay.
F	VITTI	I have until the end of the week to get strong or they're gonna eat me up. If they don't kill me in the meantime.
M	BEN	What happens next week?
F	VITTI	I can't tell you and you don't want to know.
M	BEN	It's impossible. I can't do anything that fast. And even if I could, what's my goal here? To make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?
F	VITTI	Look, the other day I saw a commercial on television, some kid playing with a couple of puppies. I cried for 45 minutes. Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman!
M	BEN	I'm sorry. I can't help you.
F	VITTI	You're turning me down?
M	BEN	Mr. Vitti, when I got into family therapy, this was not the family I had in mind. I'm turning you down.
F	VITTI	You with your schmucky little office in your schmucky little house out there in Schmuckville -- you're turning me down? What, so you can spend more time listening to housewives piss and moan about how nobody fucks them right?
M	BEN	I'd like to go now.
F	VITTI	You see this? This is what I'm talking about! I'm a dead man!
F	VITTI	You call yourself a doctor? You should be ashamed. A real doctor couldn't turn his back on a person who's suffering!
M	BEN	All right. What happened with your wife tonight?
F	VITTI	I wasn't with my wife. I was with my girlfriend.
M	BEN	You have a girlfriend? We could do two months on that alone.
F	VITTI	What, you're gonna start moralizing with me now?
M	BEN	Okay. Do you have marriage problems?
F	VITTI	No.
M	BEN	Then why do you have a girlfriend?
F	VITTI	I do things with her I can't do with my wife.
M	BEN	Why can't you do those things with your wife?
F	VITTI	Hey. That's the mouth she kisses my children good night with. What's the matter with you?
M	BEN	Okay, okay. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
F	VITTI	You mean like seeing your best friend murdered? Yeah, I got stress.
M	BEN	Well, based on what you told me before about your attacks, I'd say that's probably it then.
F	VITTI	It's just stress?
M	BEN	I doubt if there's anything physically wrong with you.
F	VITTI	You. You. You're very good.
M	BEN	There's a lot more to it --
F	VITTI	No, you're right. You're right on the money. I can feel the juices rushing back to my manhood as we speak.
M	BEN	Well, I didn't need to know that.
F	VITTI	This settles it. You're my shrink.
M	BEN	I can't treat you, Mr. Vitti. I don't think you're really ready to open up and deal with --
F	VITTI	Listen to you. The honesty. Nobody -- and I mean nobody -- talks to me like this. I'm ready. Let's do it.
M	BEN	You don't hear the word 'no' that often, do you?
F	VITTI	I hear it all the time. Only it's more like, 'No, no, please, no!'
M	BEN	All right. I'm here for two more days. When we get back to New York, I'll treat you exclusively for two weeks. I just need to figure out what to tell my other patients.
F	VITTI	You want me to clear your schedule for you?
M	BEN	No thanks, I'll handle it. Now can I go?
F	VITTI	Thank you.
F	LAURA	What is wrong with you? I woke up, you were gone, no note or anything. I've been going out of my mind, Ben. I walked all over the hotel looking for you. I almost called the police!
M	BEN	Okay, listen. I'm going to tell you the truth. I had a serious patient emergency.
F	LAURA	You have patients in Florida?
M	BEN	Just one. He followed me here from New York. I had to go.
F	LAURA	Who is this patient?
M	BEN	Paul Vitti! Paul Vitti.
F	LAURA	Oh, Ben.
M	BEN	I know. But don't worry. It's not like he's a real patient. He's got this idea in his head that I'm helping him. It's crazy.
F	LAURA	You're not going to treat him.
M	BEN	No.
F	LAURA	Tell me you're not.
M	BEN	I'm not!
F	LAURA	That would be too scary. You don't want a person like that in your life, believe me. I've covered the mob down here. I've seen what they can do.
M	BEN	Listen, it's been taken care of. I told him I couldn't see him again. He understood and it's over.
F	LAURA	You sure?
F	LAURA	I was so worried.
M	MOONY	It doesn't figure. We take out Manetta, what does Vitti do? Nothing. Why doesn't he move?
M	SINDONE	Fuck him.
M	MOONY	I'm telling you, Primo, he's planning something big. The shit is really gonna come down.
M	SINDONE	Then let it come down. Vitti's a tough guy but a lot of tough guys got fed to the crabs off Red Hook over the years. You been down there a long time. Are you measuring my inseam or contemplating a lifestyle change?
M	MOONY	Primo? What about Vitti?
M	SINDONE	Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we were growing up, he was the smart guy; I was the dope. My father was a nickel-and-dime shitheel; his father had it all. Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin because he forgot to kill Gambino before the meeting.
M	SINDONE (CONT'D)	I won't make the same mistake. I want Paul Vitti dead -- now. You two astronauts think you can handle that?
M	HANDSOME JACK	You got it, Primo.
F	LAURA	Come on. Get into it.
M	BEN	I don't understand. They jump out of the water, they splash, they eat fish. It's not a real stretch for a whale. If they did a number from West Side Story, then I'd be into it.
F	LAURA	Just stop. We're having fun, right?
M	MICHAEL	Well, to be real honest. I'm not having as much fun as it looks like I am. I'm pretending, you know, because we have to bond and everything.
M	BEN	You've got to admire the openness.
M	MICHAEL	Here comes the whale again!
M	JIMMY	Fuck me! STANDS
M	BEN	I'm hungry. Yeah, I'm going to get a hot dog. Who wants a hot dog?
M	MICHAEL	I'll go with you.
M	BEN	No, I'll go. You're pretending to have a good time. I don't want to spoil that. Be right back.
M	BEN	What is this? Are you guys following me?
M	JIMMY	Fuckin' fifteen-hundred dollar suit. You think the whales piss in that water?
M	JELLY	No, I think they use the men's room next door at the Burger King. Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
M	BEN	Is this a joke?
M	JELLY	You're an employee of Mr. Vitti's. That means you're on call twenty- four hours a day just like the rest of us.
M	BEN	No, he and I discussed this. I told him I'd see him when I got got back to New York.
M	JELLY	Don't be a skavootz. It is what it is. If he needs you sooner, you go.
M	BEN	No, I'm not going, and if you bother me again I won't treat him at all. Understand? That's it. End of story.
M	BOY	Asshole.
M	BOY	Thanks, mister.
M	BEN	They threw me in the shark tank, Paul. The shark tank!
F	VITTI	They were trying to make a point.
M	BEN	What, that you're a scary guy? I get it.
F	VITTI	You're in a mood, you know that?
M	BEN	Yeah, I get that way when a shark tries to chew on my ass.
F	VITTI	Okay. Okay. Calm down.
M	BEN	I don't want to calm down. My girl friend saw me all wet? I told her I fell into a tank with the manatees. I lied to her last night, now this. I don't like it.
F	VITTI	Manatees. That's a funny word. Manatees.
M	BEN	I'm glad you're entertained. What's the problem?
F	VITTI	Oh, I can tell you really care.
M	BEN	Okay. What's going on?
F	VITTI	I had an episode. Not an actual panic attack, but I started panicking a little thinking I might have one. Does that seem weird to you?
M	BEN	I'm redefining 'weird' on an hourly basis. What were you thinking about when you started feeling anxious?
F	VITTI	I don't know. The usual bullshit. Family problems.
M	BEN	Which family? This one?
F	VITTI	No, regular family.
M	BEN	I want you to draw a picture of a house. In the sand.
F	VITTI	What kind of house? A warehouse? A whorehouse? My house? What house?
M	BEN	A house.
F	VITTI	Why?
M	BEN	I'll tell you after you do it.
F	VITTI	This is good. I come to Florida and draw pictures in the sand like a jerkoff.
M	TINO	I don't know what they're doing. He's talking to some guy. Looks like Vitti is drawing something in the sand... What's he drawing? What am I, Superman? I'm a hundred yards away -- I can't see shit... No way, he's got that fat Jelly with him and his partner, Jimmy Boots. We could take him out with a rifle and a scope, but I don't have any of that shit with me. My scope's in the shop... Nah, it's a warranty item... Hey, don't sweat it. You told me to take care of him, I'll take care of him... Okay, I'll call you back.
F	VITTI	There. You happy?
M	BEN	Where are the people?
F	VITTI	What people? You told me to draw a house.
M	BEN	I know. But usually when people draw a house they draw people. Where are the people who live in your house?
F	VITTI	Well, you see, they'd come out and say hello, but the whole family's in the Witness Protection Program. It's very sad. What the fuck you want from me?
M	BEN	Okay, forget the house. I'm going to say some words, and you say the first thing that comes into your mind.
F	VITTI	Good, more games. Shoot.
M	BEN	Home --
F	VITTI	-- plate.
M	BEN	Mother --
F	VITTI	-- fucker.
M	BEN	Father --
F	VITTI	-- forgive me for I have sinned.
M	BEN	Wife?
F	VITTI	Love.
M	BEN	Son?
M	BEN	Son?
F	VITTI	See this? Again with the crying. Let's get out of here. We're being watched. Don't look. There's Feds on the roof of the hotel.
M	BEN	How do you know that?
F	VITTI	I'm a criminal. It's my job.
M	AGENT RICCI	Who's the new face?
M	AGENT STEADMAN	I don't know. Get somebody down there to see what he drew in the sand.
M	AGENT PROVANO	Whoever this guy is, he must be important to the family.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere. Put his picture on the wire and see what you come up with.
F	VITTI	Look at this, the whole crew. You all right? Good flight?
F	MARIE	Yeah, we're fine. We're on our way to the pool. Kids, get your stuff. We'll get out of your way.
F	VITTI	That's okay. Marie, this is a friend of mine, Ben Sobol. He's -- from the boat. A fishing boat captain. Cuban refugee.
F	MARIE	Nice to meet you, Senor Sobol.
M	BEN	Gracias.
F	VITTI	And this is Theresa and Anna --
F	ANNA	Anne.
F	VITTI	-- Anna, and the big guy, Anthony.
M	ANTHONY	How you doin'?
M	BEN	Nice to meet you.
F	VITTI	Jesus, Theresa, you are not wearing that suit to the pool.
F	THERESA	What do you want me to wear, a one-piece?
F	VITTI	I want you to wear one of those Arab bathrobes with a veil over your face, is what I want.
F	THERESA	Mom!
F	MARIE	Don't worry about it, Paul. We'll be back in time for dinner.
F	VITTI	Okay, babe. Hey, Anthony. Guess what I got?
M	ANTHONY	What?
F	VITTI	Marlins and the Braves -- right behind home plate, tonight.
M	ANTHONY	You and me?
F	VITTI	Of course, you and me. Have fun at the pool. Stay out of the deep end. And don't swim for a couple hours after you eat.
M	ANTHONY	Okay, Papa.
F	VITTI	Send Jimmy down with them.
M	JELLY	Already done.
M	BEN	Nice family. Cuban fishing boat captain?
F	VITTI	I can't tell Marie you're a shrink. She'd worry, you know.
M	BEN	About this? I think she'd be more worried about your career choice.
F	VITTI	Just keep going with the therapy.
M	BEN	You know, normally a patient wouldn't smoke or drink during a session.
F	VITTI	That's an interesting fact I'll have to remember if I'm ever on 'Jeopardy.'
M	BEN	So tell me about your father.
F	VITTI	My father. He was a big man in the neighborhood -- very well respected. Everybody loved him, God rest his soul.
M	BEN	He passed away?
F	VITTI	No, I just like saying 'God rest his soul.' Yeah, he passed away. He died when I was about twelve.
M	BEN	How?
F	VITTI	Heart attack. Sudden thing.
M	BEN	Were you and your father close?
F	VITTI	Close? Yeah, you know, pretty close. I guess we weren't getting along that great right then.
M	BEN	Why was that?
F	VITTI	I was hangin' out in the neighborhood. I had a borghata -- like a kid gang -- hooligan shit, nothin' big. But my father didn't like it.
M	BEN	You fought about it?
F	VITTI	He slapped the shit out of me.
M	BEN	And then?
F	VITTI	And then that night he died.
M	BEN	How did that feel?
F	VITTI	It felt great! How did it feel? I don't know.
M	BEN	Well, think about it. Were you angry, were you afraid? Sad?
F	VITTI	Yeah, I guess.
M	BEN	Any feelings of guilt?
F	VITTI	About what? I didn't kill him.
M	BEN	I'm just speculating, but maybe in some way you wanted him to die.
F	VITTI	Why would I want my father to die?
M	BEN	Well, you said you were fighting. You were rebelling against his authority. There may have been some unresolved Oedipal conflict.
F	VITTI	English.
M	BEN	Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his mother.
F	VITTI	Fuckin' Greeks.
M	BEN	It's an instinctual developmental drive. The young boy wants to replace his father so he can totally possess his mother.
F	VITTI	Are you saying I wanted to fuck my mother?
M	BEN	It's a primal fantasy --
F	VITTI	Have you seen my mother? That is the sickest fucking thing I've ever heard.
M	BEN	It's Freud.
F	VITTI	Well, then Freud's a sick fuck, and you are too for bringing it up. and
F	BELINDA	Well, isn't this wonderful, all of us finally getting to spend some time together.
M	SCOTT	All set for the big day, Ben?
M	BEN	Can't wait, Scott. Can I call you 'Scott?'
M	SCOTT	My friends call me 'Captain.'
M	BEN	Captain.
F	BELINDA	Well, if tomorrow goes as well as the rehearsal, I'd say it's going to be a beautiful wedding.
M	BEN	Yes, thanks for going to all this trouble, and I have to thank you and the Captain for something else.
M	SCOTT	For what?
M	BEN	For this.
F	LAURA	Would you like a drink, because I'm definitely having eight or nine.
F	BELINDA	Shall we go to the table?
M	SCOTT	Ben, there's a lot I'd like to say to you, but I'm going to skip the big father-in-law speech because I know you've been married before.
M	BEN	Technically, it wasn't considered a marriage. It was like the Korean War -- more of a police action.
M	SCOTT	I served in Korea, son. I don't think you'd be laughing if you'd seen some of the things I saw.
M	BEN	You're right. Sorry.
M	VITTI (O.S.)	Senor Sobol!
M	BEN	Mr. Vitti! How are you? Mrs. Vitti! Honey, it's the Vittis!
F	VITTI	Look at everybody. Everybody's smiling, everybody's happy. Nice. This is Marie, my girls, my boy, then all these guys.
M	BEN	Mr. and Mrs. Vitti, this is Laura, my fiancee.
F	VITTI	Nice to meet you.
F	LAURA	Thank you very much.
M	BEN	And this is my son Michael.
F	VITTI	Whoa. He's a bruiser. You're sure this is your kid? You're a pound and a half soaking wet. I've had lobsters bigger than you. You ever want a job, you come talk to me, right?
M	MICHAEL	Seriously?
M	BEN	Michael!
M	SCOTT	You're Paul Vitti. The mobster.
M	BEN	Mr. MacNamara -- uh --
F	VITTI	Excuse me. Is that polite? Is it? I'm trying to be nice here. Do I walk up to you and go, 'You're whoever you are. The prick'?
F	MARIE	Paul!
M	BEN	Mr. Vitti, this is Laura's father.
F	VITTI	Yeah? Okay, well, sorry. But you should know, there is no mob, and, P.S., I personally have never been convicted of a crime. We're nine for nine, right?
M	JELLY	That's right.
F	VITTI	I heard about the wedding. Here you go. A little something for the bride and groom. God bless. You should live and be well.
F	LAURA	Mr. Vitti, we can't accept this.
F	VITTI	Yeah, you can. Now, if you don't mind, I just need to borrow this guy for a couple of minutes, then that's it. I'm out of here. Okay?
F	LAURA	Okay. Then you leave us alone, right?
F	VITTI	Of course. I wouldn't do anything to screw up your wedding. I gotta talk to you. Come on. Have a great night, everybody. Nice to meet you.
M	BEN	I've just got to talk to him for a sec. You okay?
F	LAURA	I've never been less okay.
M	BEN	Great.
F	MARIE	I bet you eat a lot of fish since your fiance's in the business.
F	VITTI	Watch that door. And don't listen to what we say.
M	JELLY	My ears are sealed.
F	VITTI	Okay, listen. I had a really weird dream last night.
M	BEN	I feel like I'm having one right now. How could you interrupt our party?
F	VITTI	You know, you're very rigid about certain things.
M	BEN	Just tell me the dream.
F	VITTI	Okay. I'm asleep. I hear a baby crying. I go to the refrigerator, I get a bottle of milk, I take it to the baby, but when I go to give it to him, I see that the milk is black.
M	JELLY	That's fuckin' weird.
F	VITTI	Okay, get out of here!
M	JELLY	Sorry.
F	VITTI	What's it mean? And I don't want to hear any more filth about my mother.
M	BEN	I don't know what it means. What does it mean to you?
F	VITTI	This is what I'm paying you for? I say something, you say it right back to me? I could get Jelly to do this for nothing.
M	BEN	Then get Jelly.
M	BEN	Mr. MacNamara.
F	VITTI	Why don't you look over that way before I have to bust your fuckin' head open?
M	JELLY	I'm gonna get something to eat. You want like a sandwich or somethin'?
M	BODYGUARD	Yeah. What kinda sandwich isn't too fattening?
M	JELLY	A half a sandwich.
M	BODYGUARD	Sounds good.
M	JELLY	I'll be back in about twenty minutes.
M	SCOTT	Nod your head and smile. Now, you listen to me, goombah. I know what your game is, and you'd better call it quits, because if you and your paisans do anything to hurt my little girl, I'll kill you. Understand? Nod and smile.
F	LAURA	What was that about?
M	BEN	Nothing. Your father thinks I'm in the Mafia.
F	LAURA	Oh.
M	BEN	Let's get married.
M	JUSTICE	If any man here knows why these two people should not be joined in holy matrimony, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
F	VITTI	Tell Mikey to take Marie and the kids right to the airport. You get the car, bring it around to the back and wait for me.
M	BEN	That's it. I've had it with you!
F	VITTI	What happened?
M	BEN	What happened? I just saw a man fall seven stories into a platter of poached salmon! That's what happened.
F	VITTI	Did he break anything?
M	BEN	Yes. Everything! They're still picking the capers out of his forehead.
F	VITTI	Hey, people get depressed, they jump. It's a human tragedy, but it's not my fault.
M	BEN	You're telling me it was suicide?
F	VITTI	I think he left a note. Jelly, did they find that note?
M	JELLY	No, but they will in a minute.
M	BEN	Oh, yeah, here it is.
M	BEN (CONT'D)	'Life is bullshit. I can't fuckin' take it no more. Tino.'
F	VITTI	Enough talking. We got to get out of here. The place is crawling with feds. I'm going back to New York and I suggest you do the same. They're probably onto you too now.
M	BEN	Onto me? What are you talking about? Being an accessory to murder was not part of our understanding.
F	VITTI	Hey, why you busting my balls? I didn't kill him. I can't speak for everyone in the room, but -- The son-of-a-bitch came after me! It was self-defense. Trust me, Doc. In this one, we're the good guys.
M	BEN	Laura!
F	LAURA	How could you do that?
F	VITTI	Great. Another country heard from. Get her outta here.
M	BEN	Honey, why don't you wait downstairs?
F	LAURA	Why, they're going to throw me off the balcony, too? I am thirty -- over thirty years old and all my life I have dreamed of walking down the aisle in a beautiful white dress and marrying the man I love.
F	VITTI	That's a beautiful dress.
F	LAURA	Thank you, but it's not about the dress! We were supposed to get married!
F	VITTI	You're upset.
F	LAURA	Of course I'm upset! I'm going downstairs to pack, then I'm going to New York and I'm getting married with you or without you. Okay?
M	BEN	I'll be right there. Everything's going to be all right. I promise.
M	BEN	Are you happy now? You ruined my life!
F	VITTI	What, you think I wanted this? I'm the victim here! I swear, I'm going to kill that son-of-a-bitch!
M	BEN	Is that all you know? Do you hear yourself? I knew this would happen.
M	BEN (CONT'D)	This whole thing has been one big disaster from the minute you walked into my office. We're finished! You hear me? I am no longer your doctor!
F	VITTI	Just 'cause of this?
M	BEN	Of course because of this! You don't have even the tiniest shred of human decency. All you know is threats and violence and that's all you'll ever know and I can't be around that!
F	VITTI	What do you want me to do?
M	SINDONE	How come I can't get on this show? This is a good show.
M	MOONY	Primo. You got a phone call. It's Paul Vitti.
M	SINDONE	Vitti. Hello?
F	VITTI	Primo, it's Paul Vitti.
M	SINDONE	Yeah, how's it goin'?
F	VITTI	Not good. Whoever killed Dominic is shooting at me now and I'm having a lot of feelings about it and I'd like to get some kinda --
M	BEN	Closure.
F	VITTI	-- closure on this.
M	SINDONE	What kind of feelings?
F	VITTI	I feel very angry, you know. Very, uh, enraged. Mad. Real mad.
M	SINDONE	So why you telling me?
F	VITTI	Why am I telling you? Like you had nothing to do with it?
M	SINDONE	I don't know what you're talking about.
F	VITTI	Okay, whatever, I just wanted to tell you how I feel because I know that anger is --
M	BEN	A blocked wish --
F	VITTI	-- a blocked wish, and I'm getting my wish unblocked and I'm looking forward to getting some closure --
M	VITTI (CONT'D)	-- and if you make one more move on me I swear to God I'll cut your fuckin' balls off and shove 'em up your ass!
M	SINDONE	Vaffancul'!
M	SINDONE	Get a dictionary and find out what this 'closure' is. If that's what he's hitting us with, I want to know what the hell it is.
F	VITTI	Good?
M	BEN	Yeah, right up until the shoving the balls. You can't keep doing this! You want to get physical? Take a walk. Get a punching bag. Hit a pillow.
F	VITTI	There's your fucking pillow.
M	BEN	Feel better now?
F	VITTI	Yeah, I do.
M	BEN	Call the Vatican. Ask them if anything's missing.
M	MICHAEL	So cool!
M	JANET	Michael, get your bags out of the car, please.
M	MICHAEL	It's almost as tall as the house!
M	BEN	He felt bad. It's a wedding gift.
F	LAURA	Well, we're not married, so I guess we'll have to send it back.
M	BEN	Hey, don't blame me. You didn't want to finish the ceremony.
F	LAURA	What did you expect? You think that's what I want to remember on our anniversary? 'Gee, honey, let's go look at the wedding video. There's my parents, there's your parents, and there's the guy who plunged to his death.'
M	BEN	I just want to marry you.
F	LAURA	I'm starting to think that's not going to happen.
M	BEN	Come on. Next Saturday. It's all set. I even asked for a room with a low ceiling, just to discourage the jumpers.
F	LAURA	And who's going to be there?
M	BEN	Us three, a clergyman, and any family members who've completed their crisis counseling.
F	LAURA	And no guests without necks. Everybody has to have a neck.
M	BEN	We'll do a neck check at the door.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	Doctor Sobol, Mrs. Sobol -- I'm Agent Steadman, Agent Ricci, Agent Provano, Federal Bureau of Investigation, O.C.D.
M	BEN	Obsessive-compulsive disorder?
M	AGENT PROVANO	Organized Crime Division. We need to talk.
M	MICHAEL	The FBI! This is better than the fountain!
M	BEN	Michael, go to your room.
M	MICHAEL	But --
M	BEN	Go!
M	MICHAEL	Fine. I can hear better in there anyway.
M	BEN	So. FBI.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	Can you explain these photographs, Doctor Sobol?
M	BEN	I'm a psychotherapist. Paul Vitti is my patient.
F	LAURA	Was your patient.
M	BEN	Right. Was. That's what I meant.
F	LAURA	But not like a real patient.
M	BEN	Right.
M	PROVANO	So why did he send you that fountain?
M	BEN	That was a gift to celebrate the completion of his therapy. We got our television from an agoraphobic, so it's not that unusual -- you know, maybe you should discuss this with my attorney.
F	LAURA	Yeah, maybe you should.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	Doctor Sobol, Paul Vitti is an extremely dangerous man. We're talking conspiracy, fraud, extortion, racketeering, grand theft, murder...
M	BEN	Well, yeah, but don't forget, the man is a sociopath. You've got to expect that kind of behavior --
M	BEN	Excuse me, fellas. My folks are here and I'd like to -- well, die would be my first choice. Can I go out?
M	AGENT RICCI	It's your house.
F	LAURA	Too bad you didn't remember that when you were breaking in.
M	BEN	Honey, maybe the federal agents would like something to drink? Could you see what we have?
F	LAURA	No.
M	BEN	I tried, guys.
M	BEN	Hi! What a surprise.
F	DOROTHY	That certainly makes a statement. It's a little big for the yard, don't you think?
M	BEN	What can I tell you, Mom? It looked much smaller in the store.
M	ISAAC	Think it'll affect your water pressure?
M	BEN	I think it'll affect the tides. What are you doing here?
F	DOROTHY	Your father and I are just very concerned about what happened in Florida.
M	ISAAC	How was your flight home? Anyone hang themselves in first class.
F	DOROTHY	We got in last night, we couldn't sleep a wink. Is Laura inside?
M	BEN	Yeah, but she and Michael are spending some time alone, you know, getting to know each other. That's important. I don't want to disturb that dynamic.
F	DOROTHY	So you're not going to invite us in?
M	BEN	No.
F	DOROTHY	Well, I'm going to wait in the car. There's too much spray.
M	ISAAC	All right. What's with you and Paul Vitti?
M	BEN	Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
M	ISAAC	He's your patient? Are you joking? Have you thought about what this could do to your reputation?
M	BEN	You, know, I always wanted to be great, but then I realized that I might have to settle for just being good enough. Now I've got this guy who's hurting and I'm thinking that if I can help this guy, maybe I can be a little bit great.
M	ISAAC	Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's going to be hurting. I want you to stop seeing him.
M	BEN	Didn't you read your own book? Instead of trying to run my life, why don't you just close your eyes, take a deep breath, tell me what you feel, tell me what you want.
M	ISAAC	This is bullshit.
M	BEN	You wrote it.
M	ISAAC	Okay. I love you -- and I'm afraid for you -- I want you to be safe -- and I want you to have a good life.
M	BEN	Is that really it?
M	ISAAC	That's it.
M	BEN	You know why I became a shrink? Because I grew up with a great one walking around the house.
M	ISAAC	I thought you became a shrink because you were sleeping with your psychology professor at Columbia.
M	BEN	Yes, and because of you.
M	BEN	Okay, so you were saying?
M	AGENT STEADMAN	Let me cut to the chase. Sometime in the next week or so, the heads of every major crime family in the United States are going to meet together somewhere in the New York area.
M	AGENT PROVANO	We think the stage is set for a major bloodbath. Has he mentioned anything about it to you?
F	LAURA	A bloodbath?
M	BEN	No. If he said anything about a bloodbath, I probably would've remembered it. Bloodbath is one of those words that, you know, stands out in a conversation.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	You could really help us out by supplying information about that meeting.
M	BEN	And if I don't?
M	AGENT STEADMAN	If you don't, I will personally make your life a living hell. I want you to think about that and call me at this number when you change your mind.
M	BEN	You mean if I change my mind.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	I mean when.
F	LAURA	Okay. Guess what, fellas? You don't scare me.
M	BEN	Laura --
F	LAURA	Sit down! There's going to be a bloodbath. Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be between you and me. You think you can break into our home and intimidate us? That ain't the way it works here, boys. Whatever he and Paul Vitti talked about is privileged. He doesn't have to tell you a thing.
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	Tarasoff vs. The University of California. Look it up. Now, if he's done something wrong, take him downtown and book him. Otherwise, I'll ask you very kindly to get the hell out of my house.
M	AGENT STEADMAN	We'll be in touch.
M	BEN	Laura, that was really --
F	LAURA	Oh, shut up!
M	MICHAEL (V.O.)	You are in trouble.
M	MASIELLO	Paul, I don't mean this in a disrespectful way. You know I was a good friend to your father and I will always be a good friend to you. But the word is out that you've been talking to a shrink. Is that right?
F	VITTI	What's the point here?
M	MASIELLO	This concerns the whole family. Right now, we're the only ones who know about it, but if it gets out on the street -- what then? Who knows what you've been saying in there?
F	VITTI	It's none of anybody's business what I say in there.
M	MASIELLO	Paul, I beg to differ. If you're doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later, that's one thing. But everybody's gonna think you're falling apart, and that ain't good. They'll take it as a sign of weakness, and that makes us all vulnerable. Sindone would take over everything.
F	VITTI	So what do you want me to do?
M	MASIELLO	It's time to end it.
F	VITTI	What do you mean, end it?
M	MASIELLO	Get rid of this shrink. He knows too much already.
F	VITTI	You want me to whack my doctor?
M	MASIELLO	If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.
F	VITTI	No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?
M	BEN	I'm going to buy some fruit. You want anything?
F	VITTI	No, go ahead.
F	VITTI	Papa! Papa!
F	VITTI	You look lousy. You all right.
M	BEN	Listen, Paul, please don't send me any more gifts.
F	VITTI	You didn't like the fountain?
M	BEN	That's not the point. It's a boundary issue.
F	VITTI	Boundary issue? I say if more people gave from the heart, we'd all be better off. Let's see your watch. Piece of junk. You're getting a Rolex.
M	BEN	Don't buy me a Rolex.
F	VITTI	Who said anything about buying it?
M	BEN	Listen, I really need to talk to you.
F	VITTI	Tommy Angels. We grew up together. Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.
M	BEN	How did he die?
F	VITTI	He was on his way to talk to a federal prosecutor. Got hit by a truck -- twice.
M	BEN	Do I need to know that? I'm having nightmares as it is.
M	BEN	Last night I dreamed we were walking down the street, I stopped to buy some fruit, and they shot me -- like Brando in The Godfather.
F	VITTI	Good scene. Was I there?
M	BEN	You dropped your gun, then you ran over to me and started yelling, 'Papa, Papa!'
F	VITTI	I was Fredo. I don't think so.
F	VITTI	You're losing it, Doc. You may need therapy yourself.
F	VITTI	Him I don't know. Let's get private.
M	OMITTED 65A	
M	BEN	Don't you see? You called me 'Papa.' It's all about your father.
F	VITTI	What're you, nuts? It was your dream.
M	BEN	Yes, but that's what your black milk dream was about, too.
F	VITTI	Uh-uh. I don't buy it. In my dream, I'm bringing the baby the black milk.
M	BEN	Freud believed you're everyone in your dreams.
F	VITTI	Yeah, well, that guy I don't need to hear about. I can't even call my mother on the phone after that thing you told me.
M	BEN	Let's say you are the baby. What kind of milk did you get from your father?
F	VITTI	Could we stop talking about my father?
M	BEN	That's the whole point! We have to start talking about your father. You know what it's like dealing with you? This is you. You gotta help me, Doc. I'm a mess. I'm in pain. Okay, Paul, I can help you. Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti.
F	VITTI	Very good. Now I'll do you. 'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said this would be easy. Let's see how you like it. Let's talk about your father.
M	BEN	Let's not.
F	VITTI	Is he still alive?
M	BEN	Yes, he's still alive.
F	VITTI	What kind of work does he do?
M	BEN	That's not important.
F	VITTI	You paused.
M	BEN	What?
F	VITTI	You paused. That means you had a feeling. What does he do?
M	BEN	He's a psychiatrist.
F	VITTI	Ooh, you're fucked up. Next patient, please.
M	BEN	We're running out of time, Paul. Let's not waste it talking about my problems.
F	VITTI	Your father's a problem?
M	BEN	No!
F	VITTI	That's what you just said! You seem upset.
M	BEN	I'm not upset!
F	VITTI	Hey, I'm good at this.
M	BEN	We have three days left. If you want to spend it screwing around, I can't help you. Call me when you're ready to get serious.
F	VITTI	Say hello to your father for me!
M	POTATOES	We could just pop him right now.
M	HANDSOME JACK	In front of a church? What are you, a fuckin' animal? It's a holy place.
M	POTATOES	Is the sidewalk holy, too? I mean, where does the holiness end?
M	HANDSOME JACK	I don't know. Second Avenue?
M	VITTI (V.O.)	You want me to whack my doctor? If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.
M	VITTI (V.O.)	No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?
M	VITTI (V.O.)	You want me to whack my doctor? If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.
M	VITTI (V.O.)	I'll kill 'em.
M	BEN	What do you want me to do?
M	MASIELLO	Paul, he talked to the Feds.
F	VITTI	I know this guy. He would never talk to the Feds.
M	MASIELLO	The FBI was at his house today.
M	JIMMY	It's the truth. I saw 'em.
M	MASIELLO	You'll see. Next thing is he's gonna call you and ask for a meeting.
F	VITTI	Come on. You don't know this guy.
M	JELLY	It's Dr. Sobol. He says he needs to see you right away.
M	JELLY	Sit up front with Jimmy.
M	BEN	You want me to sit in front? Paul usually sits in front.
M	JIMMY	So this time you'll sit up front. Why you making a federal case?
M	BEN	Federal case? I'm not making a federal case? Let's go.
M	BEN	Wow, this is really good. Delicious. I love Italian food. I've never been to Italy but I'd love to go. I've been to France. And Jamaica. That's nice, but I'm sure it's very different from Italy. A whole different, uh -- So what's everybody doing this summer?
F	VITTI	This is Ben. He's a friend of mine. Say hello to Carlo Mangano.
M	MANGANO	How you doin'?
F	VITTI	Carlo was on my father's crew. He's always been like a -- I don't know -- like a cousin to me.
M	MANGANO	I am your cousin.
F	VITTI	I know, that's what I'm saying. It's like a family thing. The closeness.
M	MANGANO	Anything you need, anything I can do for you, Paul, you know. I'm here for you.
F	VITTI	I know. So did you take care of that thing I asked you about?
M	MANGANO	Is it all right to talk business in front of your friend?
F	VITTI	It's okay.
M	MANGANO	Yeah, I took care of it.
F	VITTI	How about that other thing?
M	MANGANO	I'm waiting for that first thing to come through. I can't move until it does.
F	VITTI	Did the guy give you a problem?
M	MANGANO	A little. He's a lunatic. What did he say?
M	MANGANO (V.O.)	The usual. Did you tell him you weren't going for it? What was I gonna do?
F	VITTI	You always gotta nip that shit in the bud.
M	MANGANO	Yeah. But if the first thing is okay, that should fix everything.
F	VITTI	Including the second thing.
M	MANGANO	Yeah, but --
F	VITTI	Exactly. Don't repeat any of that to anyone.
M	BEN	What? The first thing or the second thing?
F	VITTI	That's Stevie Beef over there. I gotta go say hello to him for a second. Come on.
M	BEN	Stevie Beef. Interesting name. When he was younger they probably called him Stevie Veal. You guys come here often?
M	JELLY	Paretti's has a very special meaning to Paul.
M	JIMMY	Yeah, this is where his father got whacked.
M	JELLY	Hey!
M	JIMMY	What's the big secret?
M	BEN	Wait a second. Paul's father was murdered?
M	JIMMY	Right at that table. With his whole family there.
M	JELLY	Hey, just shut up.
M	BEN	Paul, too? He was there?
M	JELLY	He don't like to talk about it.
M	JIMMY	Where you goin'?
M	BEN	Bathroom.
M	JELLY	I'll go with you.
M	BEN	I gotta -- you know -- poop.
M	BEN	Ahhhh! JELLY
M	JELLY	You need more roughage. A bran muffin in the morning would help with that.
M	BEN	I have to talk to you -- in private.
F	VITTI	Leave us alone.
M	BEN	Why didn't you tell me about your father?
F	VITTI	What about him?
M	BEN	You said he died of a heart attack.
F	VITTI	So what's the problem?
M	BEN	What's the problem? Your father was murdered!
F	VITTI	Heart attack, murdered, what's the difference? He's dead.
M	BEN	There's a big difference. Why didn't you tell me?
F	VITTI	Because it's private. You think I tell you every little thing?
M	BEN	That is not a little thing!
F	VITTI	Okay, you want to know? Analyze this. I was twelve years old, the whole family was having dinner together right over there, two guys walked in and shot him dead right in front of us. Okay?
M	BEN	And you didn't think this was important enough to tell me?
F	VITTI	What am I supposed to do? Spend the rest of my life crying about the past? Forget about it.
M	BEN	You know what? I think you want to talk about it.
F	VITTI	No, I don't want to talk about it.
M	BEN	I think you do.
F	VITTI	No, I don't.
M	BEN	Then why did you choose this restaurant?
F	VITTI	'Cause I like it, okay?
M	BEN	Of all the places we could've gone, why this one?
F	VITTI	White clam sauce. The best.
M	BEN	No, we're here because you wanted me to know about your father. You're reaching out to me.
F	VITTI	I'll reach out to you --
M	BEN	I think we have some major trust issues here.
M	SINDONE	I'd like to see a movie but there's nothing out there. It's all this shoot-'em-up action bullshit. I get enough of that at work.
M	MOONY	That was our friend. He marked your guy at Paretti's.
M	SINDONE	Yeah? Then let's make it the last supper. Jack?
M	HANDSOME JACK	You got it, Primo. Let's go.
M	SINDONE	Hey, Jack. Just for fun, tear out his heart and bring it to me.
M	BEN	Jimmy, you can have shotgun this time. I don't mind.
M	JIMMY	Nah, sit up front. There's more room for your legs.
M	BEN	My legs are short, it's fine in the back.
M	JIMMY	Get in the front.
M	BEN	You know what? It's late. I think I'm just going to call it a night. Why don't I just grab a cab and head on home.
M	JIMMY	Get in the car.
M	BEN	No really, it's all right.
M	JIMMY	Get in the fucking car.
F	VITTI	Do what he says.
M	BEN	You know, we call this a transference neurosis. It's when the patient starts acting out his problems with his therapist instead of out in the world. It's usually considered a good sign. Not for me, in this case, but --
M	AGENT RICCI	What's he doing in there? He's been in the bathroom for half an hour.
F	VITTI	Leave us alone.
M	JELLY	Sorry, Doc. It's not personal, you know.
M	BEN	Don't kid yourself, Jelly. It doesn't get more personal than this.
F	VITTI	You know why I have to do this, don't you?
M	BEN	Because you're a paranoid? No, actually you're a reverse paranoid. You think you're out to get everybody.
F	VITTI	Don't bullshit me! You betrayed me! You stabbed me in the back.
M	BEN	I betrayed you? What are you talking about? Who's got the gun?
F	VITTI	You think I'm an idiot? Don't insult my intelligence. You cooperated! You talked to the Feds!
M	BEN	They played me a tape! You said you were going to kill me.
F	VITTI	Never. I never said that.
M	BEN	It doesn't matter. I didn't betray you, Paul. Yes, they made me wear a wire, but I took it off, because I think I know how to help you now.
F	VITTI	I don't want to know what you think.
M	BEN	Yes, you do.
F	VITTI	No, I don't!
M	BEN	I think you do.
F	VITTI	It's over! Don't you get it? I took one chance and that's it.
M	BEN	Okay. Can I ask you one last question?
F	VITTI	What?
M	BEN	What did you order?
F	VITTI	What?
M	BEN	What did you order?
F	VITTI	When?
M	BEN	That night. What were you eating the night your father got killed?
F	VITTI	How the hell do I know?
M	BEN	You don't remember?
F	VITTI	It was 35 years ago.
M	BEN	What did your father have?
F	VITTI	I told you! I don't remember.
M	BEN	Try.
F	VITTI	What's the matter with you?
M	BEN	It's a simple question. What was your father eating!
F	VITTI	Penne.
M	BEN	Good. And you.
F	VITTI	Ravioli.
M	BEN	The food was on the table?
F	VITTI	They were just serving it.
M	BEN	Did you see the guys coming?
F	VITTI	One of them. Dressed like a busboy.
M	BEN	Did your father see him?
F	VITTI	No, but I knew he looked wrong.
M	BEN	Why?
F	VITTI	His pants. They looked too good for a busboy.
M	BEN	He walked over to the table?
F	VITTI	I watched him the whole way.
M	BEN	Did you say anything?
F	VITTI	My father was so mad at me.
M	BEN	And you were mad at him.
F	VITTI	I couldn't say anything.
M	BEN	And then.
F	VITTI	I never saw the second guy. My mother started screaming.
M	BEN	And you blame yourself?
F	VITTI	I coulda saved him.
M	BEN	But you were mad at him.
F	VITTI	I killed my father.
M	BEN	You didn't kill him, Paul. You were angry but you didn't kill him. That's the life he chose.
F	VITTI	I never got to say good-bye.
M	BEN	Say it now, Paul. Talk to him. What do you want to tell him?
F	VITTI	I can't.
M	BEN	You have to. Tell him, Paul.
F	VITTI	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
M	BEN	It's okay, Paul. You can let go of it now.
M	JIMMY	What's taking so long? I'm ruining my goddamn shoes here. Fuckin' $350 Bruno Maglis.
M	JELLY	What's wrong with you? Don't you have any respect? This is a very difficult thing for Paul.
M	JIMMY	Shoulda let me do it. I'd be home watchin' E.S.P.N.2 by now. World's strongest man. You should see these guys.
M	BEN	You couldn't save him, Paul. He was trying to save you. That's what you fought about. He didn't want this for you, and you don't want it for Anthony. You don't want him to grow up the way you did -- without a father.
M	JELLY	Jesus, the guy's fallin' apart.
M	JIMMY	Why doesn't he just pop him? It's embarrassing.
M	BEN	Your father's not dead, Paul. He's alive -- in you. And he's trying to tell you something.
M	BEN	Oh, my God!
M	BEN	Paul! They're shooting!
M	BEN	Paul! For God's sake, shoot somebody!
M	BEN	Goddamn it!
M	BEN	Oh my God! Did I do that?
M	JELLY	No, Doc. That one's mine. You got the Chevy Camaro and the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.
F	VITTI	Pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it? You can give me back the gun now, Doctor.
F	VITTI	It's okay. I wasn't really gonna whack you. All right, maybe I was gonna whack you, but I was real conflicted about it. Progress, right?
M	BEN	I don't think I can see you anymore.
F	VITTI	Yeah, I figured.
M	BEN	This was big tonight. You might feel a little raw for a while.
F	VITTI	Yeah.
M	BEN	So good luck. It's been --
F	ELAINE	I want to please him in bed, but whatever I do it seems like it's never enough. Now he wants me to say things when we're making love.
M	BEN	What kinds of things does he want you to say, Elaine?
F	ELAINE	Well, he wants me to call him 'big boy.' And he's my bucking bronco, and I'm supposed to ride him hard and put him back in the barn wet.
F	ELAINE	Are you all right, Dr. Sobol?
M	BEN	Let me suggest something, Elaine. If the man wants you to say things ... damn it, you should get down on all fours and bark like a dog if that's going to get the job done. Break out the wine, baby. Smoke a joint. Do what you have to do, because life is too short. It's just too fucking short.
F	ELAINE	Okay.
M	JELLY	How you feelin', boss? You need anything?
F	VITTI	No, I'm great. Never felt better in my life. When this meeting is over they won't know what hit 'em.
F	DOROTHY	Is Ben going to step on the glass?
M	ISAAC	No. He doesn't want to hurt his foot, so they're going to drop a person on it.
M	RABBI	We are put on this earth to find a love, a soulmate, someone with whom we can create joy. How glad we are today that Ben and Laura have found each other, and we anticipate and celebrate the years of joy they will share together from this day on.
M	RABBI	Ben, do you take this woman, Laura, to be your lawfully wedded wife, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part, so help you God?
M	BEN	No!
M	RABBI	Excuse me?
M	BEN	No, not you. I was talking to him.
M	RABBI	Who him?
M	BEN	It's not important. Yes.
M	RABBI	Yes what?
M	BEN	Yes to the thing before. To her. That's a yes. Pick it up from there.
M	JELLY	Doc, we're going to need to hurry it up here. Hi, kid.
F	LAURA	I do not believe this!
M	JELLY	Haul ass, buddy. We got a problem.
F	LAURA	Who the hell do you think you are?
M	JELLY	Ooh, she's feisty. Watch out, Doc. Tick tock, let's go. Hurry up and pronounce them, huh?
M	RABBI	By the power vested me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife.
M	JELLY	Okay. Kiss, kiss --
M	JELLY	I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Sobol, but duty calls, you know?
F	LAURA	Oh. You're the first person to call me Mrs. Sobol.
M	JELLY	Nice, huh?
F	LAURA	No.
M	BEN	Laura, I'm sorry. It's the job.
F	LAURA	Go. Just go. Have him back here by the salad course or you're in serious trouble. Capiche?
M	JELLY	You're a pistol. I like her.
M	OMITTED 97	
M	JELLY	He's bad, Doc. Worse than I ever seen him. I think his inner child is all fucked up.
M	BEN	Have you ever seen an episode like this?
M	JELLY	Yes. Once on 'Bonanza,' Hoss Cartwright got bit by a raccoon. He got this fever and he was shaking --
M	BEN	Never mind.
M	JELLY	This is serious, Doc. If he doesn't make this meeting, they'll kill him for sure.
M	BEN	Can't someone else in the family go for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie the Lip? What about you? You go?
M	JELLY	That would work except for one little detail. I'm a fucking moron. I'm known for it. You have to go.
M	BEN	Me? You must be a moron.
M	JELLY	Hey! Watch that.
M	BEN	You just said it yourself.
M	JELLY	It's different when I say it. When you say it, it sounds very negative.
M	BEN	I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going. I'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. My wife is waiting --
M	JELLY	Doc.
M	JELLY	Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't shoot you. But here's something about me you should know. I never got married, Doctor Sobol. I don't have a hobby. I never got a dog or a cat. I don't even have a goldfish. I live for one reason only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and he's what I'm thinking about when I close my eyes to sleep. If he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would I do it, I would hope to survive so I could do it again and again until he told me to stop. This is all I know. This is all I got. So please don't think I won't kill you, because I'd hate for your last thought to be a wrong one. You're going to that meeting.
M	STEADMAN	Which one is it?
M	AGENT PROVANO	The black one.
M	JIMMY	Just remember. That's a fuckin' $1200 Valentino suit. You spill anything on it, I'll mess you up good.
M	JELLY	Shut up. You're making him nervous. If he gets nervous and fucks up, they'll kill him for sure. Let's go over it again.
M	BEN	This is insane.
M	JELLY	Mr. Vitti's been detained, apologies all around, blah, blah, blah. Then you say you're the new consigliere, and you're prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti.
M	BEN	Then what?
M	JELLY	Then you just keep your mouth shut, and hope nobody asks you nothin'.
M	JIMMY	Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.
M	JELLY	Shut up. If you have to talk, just be vague. Can you do that?
M	BEN	I'm a psychologist. Believe me, I can be vague.
F	VITTI	Shouldn't you be outside playing or something?
M	ANTHONY	No, it's all right.
F	VITTI	How long you gonna sit there?
M	ANTHONY	How long you gonna lay there?
F	VITTI	I'm done.
M	BEN	I can't do this. I'm telling you, I cannot do this.
M	JELLY	Don't fucking whine! Whining's a dead giveaway. Come on! You're the consigliere, for Chrissake.
M	BEN	These are the bosses? That one looks like my Uncle Max.
M	MANGANO	What's goin' on? Where's Vitti?
M	JELLY	On his way. Don't worry.
M	MANGANO	What's he doin' here?
M	JELLY	He's -- it's okay. Forget about it.
M	MANGANO	Forget about it? What the hell is that?
M	SINDONE	Who's the guy with Jelly?
M	MOONY	I don't know.
M	BEN	I can't do this.
M	MOONY	All right, gentlemen. I think we better start. We have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues. And it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags.
M	SINDONE	I'm Primo Sindone. They call me Sonny Long. It's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country. I see Frank Zello, and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other New York family isn't here today. All I see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off little prick nobody knows.
M	JELLY	Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for -- being detained -- and he apologizes for his -- detainment.
M	SINDONE	Detained? What kind of bullshit is that? What's more important than this? As the host of this meeting, I take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men, too, who came a long way to be here.
M	JELLY	Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect. The thing is, he's not feeling well. He's sick and he -- didn't feel well --
M	BEN	Jelly! We don't ever discuss Mr. Vitti's health outside the family. You know better.
M	SINDONE	All right, who is this guy and what the fuck is he doing here?
M	BEN	In answer to your first question, my name is Ben Sobol -- -- leone. Sobboleone. They call me -- 'The doctor.' As for your second question. I'm here representing Paul Vitti. As his conser -- conghili --
M	JELLY	Consigliere --
M	BEN	Don't you ever correct me again! As his consigliere, I'm intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and I'm prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti on all matters.
M	SINDONE	Okay, Doctor, then let's get down to business. Everybody knows there's been this thing between me and Paul Vitti for a long time.
M	BEN	Which thing are you talking about? The first thing or the second thing?
M	SINDONE	What second thing? I only know one thing.
M	BEN	Well, I don't see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing. Didn't you talk to the guy?
M	SINDONE	What guy?
M	BEN	The guy with the thing.
M	SINDONE	What thing? What the fuck are you talking about?
M	BEN	How should I know? You brought it up. This is the whole problem. You can't have an intelligent conversation with the man.
M	SINDONE	How about if I just break your fuckin' neck? What do you think of that?
M	BEN	It's not important what I think. What do you think?
M	SINDONE	What do I think? I think it's a good idea! Why would I say it if I didn't think it was good?
M	BEN	I don't know. Why would you?
M	SINDONE	I wouldn't! That's what I'm saying!
M	BEN	Have you always had a problem dealing with your anger?
M	SINDONE	What are you talking about?
M	BEN	What do you think I'm talking about?
M	SINDONSINDONE	I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
M	BEN	See, you're angry again. Do you feel you have to get angry to be heard?
M	SINDONE	What's he talking about?
M	ZELLO	I don't know. But you do have a tendency to get angry a lot.
M	BALDASSARE	I agree, Primo.
M	SINDONE	I'm trying to talk about Vitti! Why are we talking about me?
M	BEN	Interesting. Do you feel you're not worthy enough to be talked about?
M	SINDONE	What does that mean?
M	BEN	What do you think it means?
M	SINDONE	Fuck you!
M	ZELLO	Primo, calm down.
M	SINDONE	Calm down? How can I calm down when this prick won't stop with the questions?
M	BEN	Could you pass the fruit, please?
M	SINDONE	That's it! You're a dead man!
M	VITTI (O.S.)	Primo!
F	VITTI	Wait outside with the car running.
M	BEN	What are you doing here?
F	VITTI	Saving your ass. Sit down. I'll take it from here.
F	VITTI	I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was late. Those of you who know me will know I meant no disrespect. If it's all right with you, there's something I'd like to say, then I'll leave you to your business.
F	VITTI	About two and a half weeks ago, somebody killed my friend, Dominic Manetta.
M	SINDONE	Don't look at me. Everybody knows you whacked him so you could take over everything.
F	VITTI	What I really came here to say is that I've come to a very important decision in my life. I want out.
F	VITTI	I'm going away for a while, but I will respect the oath I took the day I was made, and whatever I know about anyone else's business, I take with me to the grave. You have my word.
F	VITTI	As for my own organization, I know Carlo Mangano would like to be the new boss.
M	MANGANO	Thank you, Paul.
F	VITTI	That's why he betrayed Dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in Miami.
F	VITTI	But I leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss. And even though it's my right, I won't take revenge, mostly because I'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me.
M	ZELLO	I don't know, Paul. I can see where some people might have a problem with this.
F	VITTI	I realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, I've taken the liberty of writing down everything I know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my family.
M	ZELLO	I don't know what anybody else thinks, but I say good luck and God bless, Paul.
M	BALDASSARE	Good luck, Paul. Salut.
M	BEN	Well done.
F	VITTI	Let's move.
M	SINDONE	Vitti!
F	VITTI	I don't want to do this, Primo.
M	SINDONE	You don't want to do this? That's fuckin' rich. What did you think, you could just quit and walk away? You think this is a fuckin' civil service job? What are you, crazy?
F	VITTI	Not anymore. Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit I always knew you were?
M	MANGANO	I'm not gonna stab you in the back, Paul. I want to see your face when I do it.
F	VITTI	I don't think so. Mo-Mo!
F	VITTI	Bigs!
F	VITTI	Eddie!
F	VITTI	It's over, Primo. Now get the fuck outta here.
M	BEN	Good thinking. I was going to bring a machine gun but I don't have one. Of course, we haven't opened the wedding gifts yet.
M	ZELLO	Oh, shit.
M	AGENT STEADMAN (V.O.)	Drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground. I repeat. Drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground.
M	AGENT RICCI	Don't move! Don't you fucking move!
M	SINDONE	Hey! Take a pill, Robocop.
F	VITTI	I can't believe it. You took a bullet for me. What doctor ever did that much for a patient? I'll never forget that.
M	BEN	Paul -- I tripped.
F	VITTI	Yeah. You tripped over your unconscious.
M	DONNY	I don't think my mother really listens when I talk. She never listened.
F	VITTI	And how does that make you feel?
M	DONNY	It makes me feel angry.
F	VITTI	I'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't you?
M	DONNY	Yes, I do.
M	BEN	Paul, what would you say about what Donny's feeling?
F	VITTI	Donny, when you're thirsty, you don't go to the wall -- you go to the well. You know what I'm saying? Your mother may never be able to listen to you, but you have friends here who will. Okay?
M	BEN	And be patient, Donny. Most people's problems take months, sometimes years to resolve.
M	DONNY	I'm doing twenty-five to life.
M	BEN	That should be plenty of time.
M	BEN	You know they found Primo Sindone dead in a field near LaGuardia.
F	VITTI	I heard. I had nothing to do with it. There were guys lined up from Canarsie to Atlantic City who wanted to whack that bastard.
M	BEN	Okay, just checking.
F	VITTI	You know, Doc, I don't think I ever thanked you properly for curing me.
M	BEN	We don't say 'cured.' We say you had a 'corrective emotional experience.'
F	VITTI	You, you, you're very good.
M	BEN	No. You. You.
M	BEN	Happy?
F	LAURA	I just can't get used to it.
M	BEN	What?
F	LAURA	It's been three weeks since the last time you were kidnapped. I don't know if I can adjust.
M	BEN	What do you say, Tony? One more?
M	TONY BENNETT	Whatever you want, Dr. Sobol. My friend told me to stay as long as you wanted me. What do you want to hear, Mrs. Sobol?
F	LAURA	Your choice, Tony.
M	TONY BENNETT	I was hoping you'd say that. 'World on a String,' fellas.
