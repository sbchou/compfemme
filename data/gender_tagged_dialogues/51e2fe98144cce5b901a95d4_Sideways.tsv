M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MILES (O.S.)	Yeah?
M	WORKER	Hi, Miles. Can you move your car, please?
M	MILES (O.S.)	Why?
M	WORKER	The painters got to put the truck in, and you didn't park too good.
M	MILES (O.S.)	Yeah, hold on.
F	MILES	Fuck!
F	MILES	Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there by noon, but there's been all this work going on at my building, and it's like a total nightmare, and I had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm out the door right this second. It's going to be great. Yeah. Bye.
M	BARISTA	Hey, Miles.
F	MILES	Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.
M	BARISTA	Rough night, huh? For here?
F	MILES	No, I'm running late. Make it to go. And give me a New York Times and... ...a spinach croissant.
M	RANCHO PALOS VERDES	1/4 MILE
M	MRS. ERGANIAN	Look what the cat dragged!
F	MILES	Hi, everybody.
M	JACK	About time you got here, bud. Mr. Prompt.
M	MR. ERGANIAN	We were thinking maybe you took the wrong way and went to Tijuana and they didn't let you back in.
F	MILES	I had to bribe them.
F	CHRISTINE	Hey, Miles.
F	MILES	Seriously though, the freeway was unbelievable today. Unbelievable. Bumper to bumper the whole way. People getting an early start on the weekend, I guess. Granted I got a late start, but still.
M	MRS. ERGANIAN	Christine, why don't you ask Miles about the cake?
F	CHRISTINE	Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to the kitchen with me.
M	JACK	Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
F	CHRISTINE	It'll just take a second.
M	MRS. ERGANIAN	Jack tells us you are publishing a book. Congratulations.
M	MR. ERGANIAN	Yes, congratulations.
F	MILES	Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized yet, but, um, there has been some interest and --
M	MRS. ERGANIAN	Your friend is modest.
M	JACK	Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest. Indulge them. Don't make me out to be a liar.
M	MR. ERGANIAN	What subject is your book? Non- fiction?
F	MILES	No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although there's a lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non- fiction.
M	MR. ERGANIAN	Good, I like non-fiction. There is so much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time.
F	CHRISTINE	So which one do you like better?
F	MILES	I like them both, but if pressed I'd have to say I prefer the dark.
M	JACK	See?
M	JACK	Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
F	MILES	I can't help the traffic.
M	JACK	Come on. You're fucking hungover.
F	MILES	Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
F	MILES	Why did you tell them my book was being published?
M	JACK	You said you had it all lined up.
F	MILES	No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
M	JACK	Yeah, Conundrum.
F	MILES	...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
M	JACK	I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
F	MILES	It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
M	JACK	But I know it's going to happen this time. I can feel it. This is the one. I'm proud of you, man. You're the smartest guy I know.
F	MILES	Don't open that now. It's warm.
M	JACK	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
F	MILES	That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
F	MILES	For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just wasted like half of it!
M	JACK	Shut up. Here's to a great week.
F	MILES	Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
M	JACK	Yeah.
F	MILES	You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
M	JACK	Oh, that's tasty.
F	MILES	100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
M	JACK	Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
F	MILES	Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
M	JACK	Just tell me.
F	MILES	Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
M	JACK	Sure is tasty.
F	MILES	Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
M	JACK	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
F	MILES	And?
M	JACK	I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
F	MILES	How about the new ending? Did you like that?
M	JACK	Oh yeah. Much better.
F	MILES	There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
M	JACK	Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
M	JACK	It's Christine. Hey you.
M	CHRISTINE (ON PHONE)	You guys having fun?
M	JACK	Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Good. That's good.
M	JACK	So what's up?
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	So what do you think? With the Feldmans?
M	JACK	Yeah. The Feldmans.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
M	JACK	Well, then put him at the singles table.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
M	JACK	Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
M	JACK	I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
M	JACK	Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Why are you being so defensive?
M	JACK	I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
M	JACK	Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Bye.
M	JACK	I love you.
M	CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)	Bye.
F	MILES	Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite Tony Levin?
M	JACK	Whoa, why are we getting off?
F	MILES	I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
M	JACK	What?
F	MILES	I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
M	JACK	Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
F	MILES	It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
M	JACK (O.S.)	How old's she going to be?
M	MILES (O.S.)	Um... seventy... something.
M	JACK (O.S.)	That's a good age.
F	MILES	Wait a second.
M	MILES AND JACK	Surprise! Happy Birthday!
M	PHYLLIS	My God. Miles. And Jack! What a surprise. I can't remember the last time you brought me flowers.
M	JACK	They're from both of us.
M	PHYLLIS	A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
F	MILES	A famous actor who's getting married next week.
M	PHYLLIS	Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
M	JACK	Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
M	PHYLLIS	Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
M	JACK	Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
M	PHYLLIS	If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
M	JACK	You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
M	PHYLLIS	Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry?
F	MILES	Yeah, I'm hungry.
F	MILES	Just a snack. Calm down.
F	MILES	Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
M	JACK	Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
M	PHYLLIS (O.S.)	Ready for my close up!
M	PHYLLIS	Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you bring that out onto the lanai? I thought we could eat on the lanai.
M	JACK	Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
M	PHYLLIS	They're just leftovers.
M	JACK	Is it chicken?
M	PHYLLIS	I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
F	MILES	It was a surprise, Mom.
M	PHYLLIS	And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
F	MILES	You talked to Wendy?
M	PHYLLIS	Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
F	MILES	Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
M	PHYLLIS	Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
F	MILES	Uh-huh. I'll be right back.
F	MILES	...six, seven, eight,... Nine.
M	PHYLLIS	And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
M	JACK	Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
M	PHYLLIS	Spray and Wash. That's the one.
M	JACK	Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
M	PHYLLIS	I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
F	MILES	This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
M	JACK	And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
M	PHYLLIS	Miles, when are you going to get married again?
F	MILES	I just got divorced. Phyllis.
M	JACK	Two years ago, buddy.
M	PHYLLIS	You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
M	PHYLLIS	She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
M	JACK	Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
M	PHYLLIS	I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
F	MILES	I'm fine. Jack. Jack.
F	MILES	She'll wake up.
M	JACK	Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
F	MILES	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
M	JACK	That's your problem, Miles.
F	MILES	As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
M	JACK	Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
F	MILES	It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
M	JACK	You need to get laid.
M	JACK	It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
F	MILES	I'd rather have a knife.
M	JACK	No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
F	MILES	I'm working on it.
M	JACK	You still seeing that shrink?
F	MILES	I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
M	JACK	Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
F	MILES	And Lexapro, yes.
M	JACK	Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
F	MILES	Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
M	JACK	And get your bone smooched.
M	JACK	What?
F	MILES	You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
M	JACK	Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
F	MILES	These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
M	JACK	I thought you hated Chardonnay.
F	MILES	I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
F	MILES	Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? And the ocean's just right over that ridge. See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries. Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity.
M	JACK	Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
F	MILES	Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.
F	MILES	So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
M	JACK	I told you. Filet and salmon.
F	MILES	Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
M	JACK	I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
F	MILES	Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
M	JACK	Let me call Christine.
F	MILES	Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
M	JACK	I owe her a call anyway.
M	JACK	Hey, honey. So we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon.
M	JACK	No, I know, I didn't forget, but we wound up at Miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so I'm calling you now. I said I was sorry. Yes, I did. You heard me say I was sorry, right?
M	JACK	Miles heard me say I was sorry.
M	JACK	Give me a break, will you? I just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't call. You're totally right. I know, but I'm trying to make this the best wedding I can with the best wine we can find. Don't I get any credit for that? Okay. Look, I've got to go. I'm out here in the parking lot, and Miles is waiting for me...
M	JACK	Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
F	MILES	Now we're talking.
M	CHRIS	This is the condemned man?
F	MILES	Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.
M	JACK	How you doing?
M	CHRIS	You guys want to start with the Vin Gris?
M	JACK	Sounds good.
M	JACK	This is rose, right?
F	MILES	Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
M	JACK	Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all Pinots are noir.
F	MILES	Let me show you.
F	MILES	First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity. What color is it supposed to be?
F	MILES	Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
M	JACK	Huh.
F	MILES	Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
F	MILES	Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.
F	MILES	What do you smell?
M	JACK	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
F	MILES	There's not much there yet, but you can still find... ...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty Edam cheese.
M	JACK	Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
F	MILES	Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
F	MILES	Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors. Very important. Now we smell again.
F	MILES	That's what you do with every one.
M	JACK	When do we get to drink it?
F	MILES	Now.
M	JACK	How would you rate this one?
F	MILES	Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
M	CHRIS	Released it about two months ago.
F	MILES	Nice job.
M	CHRIS	We like it.
M	JACK	You know, you could work in a wine store.
F	MILES	Yeah, that would be a good move.
F	MILES	Are you chewing gum?
M	JACK	Want some?
F	MILES	Hey Jack, hurry up! Just a minute!
M	JACK	I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
F	MILES	It's not even a mile.
M	JACK	We should have driven.
F	MILES	Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
M	JACK	You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
F	MILES	Whoa.
M	JACK	Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
F	MILES	Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
M	JACK	Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
F	MILES	So you're going to stop acting?
M	JACK	No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
F	MILES	Uh-huh.
M	JACK	We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
F	MILES	If that's what feels right.
M	JACK	It does. Feels right.
F	MILES	Then it's a good thing.
M	JACK	Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
M	GARY	Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
F	MILES	Gary.
M	GARY	When's that novel of yours coming out? We all want to read it.
F	MILES	Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
M	GARY	My condolences.
F	MILES	What are you pouring tonight?
M	GARY	Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
F	MILES	Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.
M	GARY	What do you think?
F	MILES	Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
M	JACK	Yeah. Tight.
F	MILES	Pour us a couple. Here's to my last week of freedom.
F	MILES	It's going to be great. Here's to us.
M	JACK	Miles. Check it out.
F	MILES	Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
M	JACK	You know her?
F	MILES	Sure I know Maya.
M	JACK	You know that chick?
F	MILES	Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
M	JACK	She is very hot.
F	MILES	And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
M	JACK	Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
F	MILES	This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
M	JACK	So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
F	MILES	You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
F	MAYA	Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
F	MILES	Maya, how are you?
F	MAYA	I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
F	MILES	Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
F	MAYA	Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
F	MILES	You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
M	JACK	Hiya.
F	MAYA	Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
M	JACK	Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
F	MILES	Well, she does know a lot about wine.
M	JACK	Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
F	MILES	And she likes Pinot.
M	JACK	Perfect.
F	MILES	Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
M	JACK	Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
F	MILES	She works for tips!
M	JACK	You're blind, dude. Blind.
F	MILES	I also recommend the ostrich. Very lean. Locally raised.
F	MILES	I hate Tony Levin.
F	MAYA	Highliner, please.
M	JACK	That's on us.
F	MAYA	Hey, guys.
F	MILES	You want to join us?
F	MAYA	Sure.
F	MAYA	So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
F	MILES	I finished it.
F	MAYA	Good for you.
M	JACK	It's getting published. That's what we're up here celebrating.
F	MAYA	That's fantastic. Congratulations.
F	MAYA	Are you a writer too?
M	JACK	No, I'm an actor.
F	MAYA	Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
M	JACK	A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
F	MAYA	Anything I'd know?
M	JACK	Maybe. Recognize this?
M	JACK	"Now with low, low 5.8% APR financing."
F	MAYA	That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
M	JACK	I am one of those guys.
F	MAYA	You are not.
F	MILES	He is.
M	JACK	Consult your doctor before using this product. Side effects may include oily discharge, dizziness, hives, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble... you're fucked!
F	MAYA	Oh. I needed that. Thank you.
F	MAYA	So what are you guys up to tonight?
F	MILES	We're pretty wiped. Probably go back to the hotel and crash.
F	MAYA	Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
F	MILES	The Windmill.
M	JACK	Windmill.
F	MAYA	Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
F	MILES	See you.
M	JACK	We'll catch up with you later, okay?
M	JACK	We'll probably go back to the hotel and crash?
M	JACK	you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
F	MILES	Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
M	JACK	The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
F	MILES	Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
M	JACK	I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
F	MILES	Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
M	JACK	Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
F	MILES	How do you know?
M	JACK	No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
M	JACK	Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
F	MILES	Shut up.
M	JACK	She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
F	MILES	Have you no shame?
M	JACK	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
F	MILES	Fuck you.
F	MILES	Shut the fuck up!
M	JACK	You need to get your prostate checked.
F	MILES	So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
M	JACK	So what's the plan today?
F	MILES	We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
F	MILES	What's your problem?
F	MILES	What is it?
M	JACK	I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
F	MILES	Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
M	JACK	Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
F	MILES	Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
M	JACK	No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
M	WAITRESS	Can I take your order?
M	JACK	But I am warning you.
F	MILES	Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye toast. Dry.
M	WAITRESS	Okay. And you?
M	JACK	Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.
F	MILES	How much skin and stem contact?
M	POURER	About four weeks.
F	MILES	Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
M	POURER	About a year.
F	MILES	French or American?
M	POURER	Both.
F	MILES	Good stuff.
M	JACK	Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.
F	MILES	Nice, huh?
M	JACK	Beautiful.
F	MILES	Victoria and I used to like this view. Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
M	JACK	Miles.
F	MILES	She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
M	JACK	Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
F	MILES	I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
M	JACK	Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
F	MILES	She what? When?
M	JACK	About a month ago. Six weeks.
F	MILES	To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
M	JACK	Miles... MILES...
M	JACK	Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
F	MILES	I want to go home now.
M	JACK	You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
F	MILES	Is she bringing him to the wedding?
M	JACK	What do you think?
F	MILES	You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
M	JACK	Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
F	MILES	I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
M	JACK	No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
F	MILES	You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
M	JACK	Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!
M	JACK	Miles?
M	JACK	You going to be okay?
F	STEPHANIE	Hey, guys. How's it going?
M	JACK	Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
F	STEPHANIE	That's what people say.
F	MILES	You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
M	JACK	I'm a quick learner.
F	MILES	I'm trying to teach my friend here some basics about wine over the next few days before he goes off and --
M	JACK	That's right -- I'm here to learn. I never had that much interest in wine before, but this trip has been very enlightening. Always like wine, of course, but I don't know. More of a beer man, really. Microbreweries.
F	STEPHANIE	Well, no better way to learn than tasting.
M	JACK	Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
F	STEPHANIE	Stephanie.
M	JACK	Nice.
F	STEPHANIE	So what do you think?
F	MILES	Quaffable but far from transcendent.
M	JACK	I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.
F	STEPHANIE	Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
F	MILES	Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
M	JACK	Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
F	STEPHANIE	In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
M	JACK	Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
F	STEPHANIE	Oh yeah.
M	JACK	You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
F	STEPHANIE	Sure I know Maya. Real well.
M	JACK	No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
F	MILES	Could we move on to the Syrah, please?
F	STEPHANIE	This is our Estate Syrah...
M	JACK	You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
F	STEPHANIE	I know. I might need to be spanked.
F	STEPHANIE	Excuse me.
M	JACK	A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
F	MILES	Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
M	JACK	Get the trunk.
F	MILES	You have the keys.
M	JACK	We're on.
F	MILES	What?
M	JACK	She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
F	MILES	With Maya?
M	JACK	Been divorced for a year now, bud.
M	JACK	Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
F	MILES	Well, she is cute.
M	JACK	Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
M	JACK	You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
F	MILES	Nah. I want to watch this.
M	JACK	Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.
M	JACK	Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi -- goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts up here. Whole place is wide open. Assylvania.
F	MILES	So what should I wear?
M	JACK	I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
M	JACK	Don't you have any other shoes?
M	JACK	Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking in. Not much. We're about to go out for dinner, probably be out pretty late, so I thought I'd say goodnight now. I know, I love you too. I miss you.
M	JACK	Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
F	MILES	Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
M	JACK	Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
F	MILES	Aye-aye, captain.
M	JACK	And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
F	MILES	If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
M	JACK	Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
M	JACK	And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
F	MILES	Okay! Fuck!
M	JACK	We're going in.
M	JACK	How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
F	STEPHANIE	Good. How're you?
M	JACK	Great. You look great. You both do.
F	STEPHANIE	Not so bad yourself.
F	MILES	What are you drinking?
F	MAYA	A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
F	MILES	Oh yeah? How is it?
F	MAYA	Try it.
F	MILES	Nice. Very nice.
F	MAYA	Twelve months in oak.
F	MILES	On a Sauvignon Blanc?
F	MAYA	I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
F	MILES	This is good. Little hints of clove.
F	MAYA	I know. I love that.
M	WAITER	...medallions of pork with a dusting of black truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped potatoes. And finally a Copper River salmon grilled on an alder wood plank. And that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed watercress.
M	WAITER	And who gets the wine list?
F	MAYA	I guess Miles wants it.
F	MILES	Nope. You ladies choose.
F	MAYA	You choose, Stephanie.
F	STEPHANIE	So what does everyone feel like?
M	JACK	Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
F	MAYA	No, we're paying for the wine.
M	JACK	I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
F	MAYA	Well, in that case...
F	STEPHANIE	What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
F	MILES	Exactement!
F	MAYA	I'm having the salmon.
F	MILES	That's what I'm having.
F	STEPHANIE	I'm thinking about the duck breast.
M	JACK	Me too.
F	MAYA	Well, that narrows things down.
F	STEPHANIE	Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.
M	JACK	Pinot!
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Hello?
F	MILES	Victoria.
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Miles?
F	MILES	Victoria! How the hell are you?
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
F	MILES	Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
F	MILES	Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Where are you?
F	MILES	A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
M	MILES (CONT' D)	Hello?
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
F	MILES	I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Ken.
F	MILES	Ken.
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
F	MILES	Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
F	MILES	You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
F	MILES	I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
M	VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)	Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
F	MILES	Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the boss.
M	JACK	Easy, boy. Easy.
F	MAYA	Are you all right?
F	MILES	Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.
F	STEPHANIE	Excuse us.
F	MAYA	Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.
F	MILES	That's okay.
M	JACK	What the fuck, man? What is up?
M	JACK	Pull yourself together, man.
F	MILES	I'm fine!
M	JACK	Where were you?
F	MILES	Bathroom.
M	JACK	Did you drink and dial?
M	JACK	Why do you always do this? Victoria's gone, man. Gone. Poof.
M	JACK	Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
F	MILES	Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
M	JACK	Oh Jesus, Miles.
M	JACK	And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
F	MILES	Shut up. Shut your face.
M	JACK	Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here. Drink some agua.
F	MILES	Should we get dessert?
F	STEPHANIE	We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
M	JACK	Excellent idea. Waiter!
M	JACK	Let me see that.
M	JACK	Here. One for you, three for me.
F	MILES	You sure you want to do this?
M	JACK	We're here!
F	STEPHANIE	What happened to you guys?
M	JACK	Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.
M	JACK	Hi.
F	STEPHANIE	Hi. Maya's in the kitchen.
F	MILES	Hi.
F	MAYA	Hey.
F	MILES	She got anything good?
F	MAYA	Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
M	STEPHANIE (V.O.)	Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
F	MILES	She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
F	MAYA	Who do you think you're dealing with here?
F	MAYA	How about this?
F	MAYA	Nope. I don't think we know each other well enough. I'd say this guy's more our speed.
F	MAYA	So what gems do you have in your collection?
F	MILES	Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
F	MAYA	You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...
F	MAYA	Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
F	MILES	Yeah, I know.
F	MAYA	It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
F	MILES	I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
F	MAYA	The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
F	MILES	How long have you been into wine?
F	MAYA	I started to get serious about seven years ago.
F	MILES	What was the bottle that did it?
F	MAYA	Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
F	MILES	Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
F	MAYA	I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
F	MILES	Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
F	MILES	Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
F	MAYA	Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
F	MILES	Is she sleeping or...?
F	MAYA	She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie. "And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."
F	MAYA	You got kids?
F	MILES	Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
F	MAYA	Yeah, same here.
F	MAYA	Let's go in there.
F	MAYA	Looks like our friends are hitting it off.
F	MAYA	It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
F	MILES	Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
F	MAYA	Yeah, weird. But great.
F	MILES	Yeah. Definitely.
F	MAYA	So what's your novel about?
F	MILES	Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
F	MAYA	What's the title?
F	MILES	"The Day After Yesterday."
F	MAYA	Oh. You mean... today?
F	MILES	Um... yeah but it's more...
F	MAYA	So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
F	MILES	Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
F	MAYA	Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
F	MILES	Yeah. Thanks.
F	MAYA	Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
F	MILES	A paper?
F	MAYA	Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
F	MILES	Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
F	MAYA	I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
F	MILES	So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
F	MAYA	Well...
F	MILES	I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
F	MAYA	Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
F	MILES	My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
F	MAYA	Can I ask you a personal question?
F	MILES	Sure.
F	MAYA	Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
F	MILES	I don't know. It's a hard grape to grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early. It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.
F	MILES	I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
F	MAYA	What about me?
F	MILES	I don't know. Why are you into wine?
F	MAYA	I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
F	MILES	Yeah? Like what?
F	MAYA	Like what a fraud he was.
F	MAYA	No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline. And it tastes so fucking good.
F	MILES	Bathroom over there?
F	MAYA	Yeah.
F	MILES	You are such a loser. Come on!
F	MAYA	I was just getting some water. You want some water?
F	MAYA	Nice. I should probably get going.
F	MAYA	You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
F	MILES	Got it.
F	MAYA	I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
F	MILES	Good. So did I.
F	MAYA	Okay. See you around.
F	MILES	Um... did you still want to read my novel?
F	MAYA	Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
F	MAYA	Wow. Great.
F	MILES	Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
F	MAYA	Goodnight, Miles.
M	JACK	Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be- lieve-able!
M	JACK	Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
F	MILES	Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
F	MILES	You didn't invite Stephanie to come with us, did you?
M	JACK	Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
F	MILES	We were supposed to play golf.
M	JACK	You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad. It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
F	MILES	Count me out.
M	JACK	Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
M	JACK	Later.
F	MILES	Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
M	JACK	Oh, boy.
F	MILES	She's been leaving messages here too.
M	JACK	Yeah. Okay.
F	MILES	You should call her.
M	JACK	I will. See ya!
F	MILES	Right now.
M	JACK	Okay! Jesus!
M	JACK	I've got no problem calling her.
M	JACK	Wait outside, will you?
F	STEPHANIE	That was fun last night.
F	MILES	Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
F	STEPHANIE	Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
F	STEPHANIE	Where's Jack?
F	MILES	He had to make a phone call.
F	STEPHANIE	So what are you up to today, Miles?
F	MILES	Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
F	STEPHANIE	Huh.
F	MILES	Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
F	STEPHANIE	Oops. Sorry.
F	MILES	You golf?
F	STEPHANIE	Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
F	MILES	Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
M	JACK	Hey Miles. Miles.
M	JACK	Do you have that other condom?
F	MILES	What'd Christine say?
M	JACK	Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
M	SYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.)	No new messages.
M	JACK	Not now! Not now!
M	JACK	Hey, there you are.
F	MILES	Yep.
M	JACK	What're you drinking?
M	JACK	Any good?
M	JACK	Could I get a glass please? Stephanie took me out into the Pinot fields today. It was awesome. I think I finally got a handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the -- what do you call it? -- selection and harvest. And the whole, you know, big containers where they mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes right off the vine. Still a little sour but already showing potential for great structure. Stephanie really knows her shit, Miles.
F	MILES	Where is Stephanie?
M	JACK	Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
F	MILES	What the fuck are you doing?
M	JACK	What?
F	MILES	With this chick.
F	MILES	Does she know about Saturday?
M	JACK	Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
F	MILES	Besides what?
M	JACK	Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
F	MILES	What?
M	JACK	Well, I've been doing some thinking.
F	MILES	Oh, you've been thinking. And?
M	JACK	I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
M	JACK	I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles. I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. And not just for my sake. I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too. I take marriage very seriously -- always have. That's why I've never done it before. The day I get married, it's going to be the real thing.
M	JACK	Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
F	MILES	Deep.
M	JACK	Don't get all judgmental on me. This is my deal. It's my life, and it's my call.
M	JACK	I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
F	MILES	Understanding of what?
M	JACK	Like I might be in love with another woman.
F	MILES	In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
M	JACK	Look who's talking. You've been there.
F	MILES	Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
M	JACK	This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
F	MILES	And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
M	JACK	Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
F	MILES	You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
M	JACK	What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
F	MILES	What? Of course I like Christine.
M	JACK	You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
F	MILES	That was three years ago after that first party!
M	JACK	Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
F	STEPHANIE	Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
F	MILES	Where?
M	CARYL	Stephanie's heard this a thousand times, but if I'd done what I wanted and I'd bought up in Santa Maria when I had the chance, I would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet center and that Home Depot. Your father knew it too, but he was a fucking chickenshit. Always was.
M	JACK	Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
F	MILES	Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
F	STEPHANIE	See you, Miles. You take care.
F	MILES	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
M	SIENA AND CARYL	Bye, Miles.
M	JACK	Call me on my cell if you go out.
F	MILES	Yeah.
F	MILES	And could I get a Barely Leqal?
F	MILES	NO, um, the new one.
M	GARY	How's it hanging, Miles?
F	MILES	You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
M	GARY	Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
F	MILES	Highliner.
M	GARY	Glass or bottle?
F	MILES	Bottle.
M	GARY	You got it.
F	MILES	Say, is Maya working?
M	GARY	Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
F	MILES	Oh, that's tasty.
M	GARY	You okay, Miles?
F	MILES	I'm good.
M	JACK	Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I got us in at Alisal.
F	MILES	That's a public course. No Stephanie?
M	JACK	She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy. This is our day!
M	JACK	Crap.
M	JACK	Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
F	MILES	Nope.
M	JACK	She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
F	MILES	Can you give me some room here?
M	JACK	Oh yeah. Sure.
M	JACK	You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
F	MILES	Thanks, Jack.
M	JACK	Don't whiff it.
M	JACK	Nice shot.
F	MILES	You're an asshole.
M	JACK	What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
F	MILES	Nope.
M	JACK	What do you think's going on?
F	MILES	Could be anything.
M	JACK	Been checking your messages?
F	MILES	Obsessively.
M	JACK	Huh.
F	MILES	They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
M	JACK	But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
M	JACK	Or fuck those New York publishers. Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. Just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it in libraries. Let the public decide.
M	JACK	Don't come over the top. Stay still.
F	MILES	Shut up.
M	JACK	Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
F	MILES	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
M	JACK	Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. Here.
F	MILES	What is it?
M	JACK	I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
F	MILES	Huh. Let me see the label.
M	JACK	What the fuck?
M	HUSBAND #1	Hurry it up, will you?
F	MILES	Fucker hit into us.
M	JACK	Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
F	MILES	Throw me his ball.
M	JACK	Nice shot.
M	JACK	Oh, this is going to be fun. This is going to be fun.
M	JACK	Hit into us again, motherfuckers, and I'll ass-rape all four of you!
M	JACK	Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
F	MILES	I don't want to talk about it.
M	JACK	All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
M	GOLFER	Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?
M	JACK	Is it the money thing?
F	MILES	Is what the money thing?
M	JACK	With Maya.
F	MILES	Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
M	JACK	Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
F	MILES	Slaughterhouse.
M	JACK	Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
M	JACK	It's Steph. Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I mean I would, but let me see. Hey, Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going. We'll be right there. Me too.
M	JACK	We're on.
F	MILES	What's happening?
M	JACK	We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
F	MILES	What exactly are we going to do?
M	JACK	I said okay?
F	MILES	You have to tell me --
M	JACK	I SAID OKAY?
F	MILES	Okay.
F	MAYA	Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
F	MILES	Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
F	MAYA	I had class.
F	MILES	Well, nice to see you now.
F	MAYA	You too.
M	JACK	You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
F	MILES	He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
M	JACK	Huh.
F	MAYA	You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
F	MILES	Great. What's the latest we can get there?
F	MAYA	About two-thirty.
F	MILES	Okay.
F	MAYA	Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
F	MILES	No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
F	MAYA	What rehearsal dinner?
F	MAYA	Who's getting married?
F	MAYA	Were you ever going to say anything?
F	MILES	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
F	MILES	Maya.
F	MAYA	Don't touch me. Just take me home.
F	MILES	I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
F	MAYA	Do you know what he's been saying to her?
F	MILES	He's an actor, so it can't be good.
F	MAYA	Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
F	MILES	I'm sure he believed every word.
F	MILES	Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
F	MAYA	But you wanted to fuck me first.
F	MILES	Oh, Maya. No.
F	MAYA	Yeah.
F	MAYA	You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
F	MILES	And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
F	MAYA	Could I have my paper, please?
M	JACK	Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
F	MILES	Put me down, Jack.
F	MILES	I said put me down. Jack!
M	JACK	I'm so proud of you! Let me love you!
M	JACK	So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
F	MILES	No.
M	JACK	What?
F	MILES	It's private.
M	JACK	You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
F	MILES	Let's leave it alone.
M	JACK	You didn't get any, did you? You're a homo.
F	MILES	Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
M	JACK	Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
M	JACK	Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
F	MILES	Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
F	MILES	Don't answer it.
F	MILES	I'm telling you, don't.
M	JACK	Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Christine.
M	JACK	Listen, honey. Let me call you back. Miles and I are in the middle of something. No, it's nothing serious -- Miles is just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call you right back.
F	MILES	This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. I want to go home.
M	JACK	Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
F	MILES	We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
M	JACK	I know what you need.
M	SALES ASSOCIATE	There you go.
F	MILES	Do you like them?
M	JACK	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
F	MILES	Are they too sporty?
M	JACK	Feel better?
M	JACK	Oh here, wait a second. I want to run in here real quick.
M	JACK	I want to get something for Siena.
M	JACK	How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
F	MILES	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
M	JACK	You ever actually been in there, Miles?
F	MILES	I don't have to.
M	JACK	I say we check it out. You never know.
F	MILES	Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
M	JACK	I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
F	MILES	Let me use your phone.
M	JACK	What's up?
F	MILES	I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn. Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.
F	MILES	Hi, it's Miles.
M	ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)	Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can get her. You're in luck. I'll put you through.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	Miles.
F	MILES	Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	How's the trip?
F	MILES	Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
F	MILES	And?
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
F	MILES	Huh.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	Are you there? Miles?
F	MILES	Yeah, I'm here.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back.
F	MILES	So I guess that's it.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
M	EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)	Just hang in there, and who knows? After you get something else published, we can revisit this one. And next time we can try a different title.
F	MILES	Hit me again.
F	MILES	Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
M	POURER	This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
F	MILES	Just give me a full goddamn pour.
M	POURER	Sir, what are you doing?
F	MILES	I told you I need a drink.
M	POURER	Then buy a bottle and go outside.
M	POURER	Put the glass down.
M	POURER	You're going to have to leave, sir.
M	JACK	It's all right. His mother just died.
M	JACK	Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
F	MILES	No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
M	JACK	What's that supposed to mean?
F	MILES	You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
M	JACK	What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
F	MILES	Thanks.
M	JACK	Don't give up. You're going to make it.
F	MILES	Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
M	JACK	See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
F	MILES	Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
M	JACK	Oh, look. There's Steph!
M	JACK	Hey, baby.
M	JACK	Look what I got for our favorite girl.
F	STEPHANIE	YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
F	MILES	Stephanie! Stop!
F	STEPHANIE	You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
M	JACK	I can explain.
F	STEPHANIE	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
F	STEPHANIE	Fuckface! You too!
F	MILES	Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
M	JACK	Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
F	MILES	No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
M	JACK	You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
F	MILES	Keep it elevated.
M	MAYA (ON THE PHONE)	Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
F	MILES	It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me. And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
F	MILES	Well?
M	JACK	I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
F	MILES	Good thing you have a voice-over career.
M	JACK	Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
F	MILES	That's thoughtful.
M	JACK	Yeah.
M	JACK	I hate this place.
F	MILES	Take a couple of these, and you'll learn to love it.
F	MILES	Two for you. And two for me.
M	JACK	So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
F	MILES	Huh. Let me think.
M	JACK	You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
F	MILES	Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
M	JACK	I don't know. Just seems fishy.
M	JACK	What's it look like to you?
F	MILES	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
M	JACK	I'm hungry.
M	JACK	You know what I'm thinking?
F	MILES	What's that?
M	JACK	I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
F	MILES	Uh-huh.
M	JACK	Mm. Mm.
M	WAITRESS	And here're your Handi-wipes.
M	JACK	Oh, so that's what those are? For a second there I thought you guys were promoting safe sex.
M	WAITRESS	I'll be right back with more corn bread.
M	JACK	I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
F	MILES	I don't know. I wouldn't know.
M	JACK	Nice technique there... ...Cammi.
F	CAMMI	It's all in the wrist. You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
M	JACK	No, we're from San Diego. Why?
F	CAMMI	I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
M	JACK	Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
F	CAMMI	Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
M	JACK	You have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair.
F	CAMMI	No. Way. No way!
F	CAMMI	Oh, my God!
F	MILES	Could you tell me where the bathroom is?
F	CAMMI	Uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo.
M	JACK	She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
F	MILES	You're joking, right? What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
M	JACK	Look, Miles. I know you're my friend and you care about me. And I know you disapprove. I respect that. But there are some things I have to do that you don't understand. You understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight. And that's okay.
M	JACK	Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.
M	JACK	Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My nose.
M	JACK	Fucking chick's married.
F	MILES	What?
M	JACK	Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
F	MILES	Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
M	JACK	Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
F	MILES	That's five clicks, Jackson.
M	JACK	Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
M	JACK	We gotta go back.
F	MILES	What?
M	JACK	I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
F	MILES	Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
M	JACK	You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
F	MILES	Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
M	JACK	No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
F	MILES	No way. No way.
M	JACK	Please, Miles, please.
F	MILES	Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
M	JACK	No, we've got to get my wallet! Those rings are irreplaceable! We've got to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up. You gotta help me. You gotta help me. Pleeeease!
M	JACK	Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing. Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, this one last thing. I can't lose Christine. I can't. I'm nothing without her. Please, Miles, please... uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......
F	MILES	She tell you she was married?
M	JACK	Yeah.
F	MILES	So what the fuck were you thinking?
M	JACK	Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
F	MILES	Cutting it a little close, don't you think? So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
M	JACK	Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
M	JACK	Yeah, this is the block. Just keep going... Yeah! This is it. There's her car.
F	MILES	So what's the plan?
M	JACK	The plan is... you go.
F	MILES	Me?
M	JACK	My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
F	MILES	Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
M	JACK	Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
M	JACK	Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
F	MILES	Hold on.
M	MAN	You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
F	CAMMI	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
M	MAN	You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
F	CAMMI	I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
M	MAN	And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
F	CAMMI	I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
M	MAN (O.S.)	The fuck was that? The wallet! He took Derek's wallet! Get him!
F	MILES	Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn door!
M	MAN	You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! I'll kill you motherfuckers!
M	JACK	You did it! You fucking did it!
M	MAID	Housekeeping.
F	MILES	Hey, Jack. Jack.
M	JACK	Hrnrnrn?
F	MILES	That was quite a day yesterday.
M	JACK	Yep. Quite a day.
F	MILES	Quite a week.
M	JACK	Want me to drive?
F	MILES	No, I'm okay.
M	JACK	Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
F	MILES	Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
M	JACK	You're so negative.
M	JACK	Come on, let me drive.
F	MILES	I'm fine. You rest.
M	JACK	I feel like driving.
F	MILES	What's wrong?
M	JACK	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
F	MILES	What the fuck!
M	JACK	You said it looked like a car accident.
F	MILES	What the fuck!
M	JACK	I'll pay for it.
F	MILES	Look at this!
M	JACK	I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
F	MILES	Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
M	JACK	You need a new car anyway.
M	JACK	I said I'd pay for it.
F	MILES	You broke some.
M	JACK	Whatever. Sorry.
F	MILES	No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
M	JACK	You ready?
F	MILES	Oh, fuck!
M	JACK	It's okay. I've got Triple A.
F	MILES	Well. That about does it.
M	JACK	Why don't you come in?
F	MILES	Uh-uh. You're on your own.
M	JACK	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
F	MILES	Yeah.
M	JACK	Love you, man.
F	MILES	Back at you.
M	JACK	Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
F	MILES	Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
M	JACK	You were wearing your belt.
M	VICTORIA (O.S.)	Hey, Miles.
F	MILES	Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful.
F	VICTORIA	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
M	KEN	How are you?
F	MILES	Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky guy.
M	KEN	Thanks. I'll wait for you at the car. Nice to meet you, Miles.
F	MILES	Ken.
F	MILES	That was big of him.
F	VICTORIA	Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
F	MILES	That's great.
F	VICTORIA	So how're you doing?
F	MILES	Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
F	VICTORIA	So what's happening with your book?
F	MILES	Universally rejected. Strike three.
F	VICTORIA	Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
F	MILES	Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
F	VICTORIA	I am.
F	MILES	Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
F	VICTORIA	I guess.
F	MILES	Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
F	VICTORIA	Not me. I'm not drinking.
F	MILES	You quit drinking?
F	VICTORIA	I'm pregnant.
F	MILES	Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
F	VICTORIA	See you over there, Miles.
F	MILES	Yeah.
M	14-YEAR-OLD BOY (O.S.)	"The marrow of his bone," I repeated aimlessly. This at least penetrated my mind. Phineas had died from the marrow of his bone flowing down his blood stream to his heart.
M	14-YEAR-OLD BOY	I did not cry then or ever about Finny. I did not cry even when I stood watching him being lowered into his family's straight-laced burial ground outside of Boston. I could not escape a feeling that this was my own funeral, and you do not cry in that case.
M	14-YEAR-OLD BOY	Do you want me to keep reading the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?
F	MILES	Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on Monday.
M	ANSWERING MACHINE	One new message.
M	MAYA'S VOICE	Hello, Miles. It's Maya.
M	MAYA'S VOICE	Thanks for your letter. I would have called you sooner, but I think I've needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me. Another reason I didn't call sooner is that I wanted to finish your book, which I finally did last night.
M	MAYA'S VOICE	I think it's really lovely, Miles. You're so good with words. Who cares if it's not getting published? There are so many beautiful and painful things about it. Did you really go through all that? It must have been awfully hard. And the sister character -- Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to say I was really confused by the ending. Did the father finally commit suicide, or what? It's driving me crazy. And the title.
M	MAYA'S VOICE	Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy here lately. But I like winter. So listen, if you ever do decide to come up here again, you should let me know. I would say stop by the Hitching Post, but to tell you the truth I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to be working there. I'm going to graduate soon so I'll probably relocate. We'll see.
M	MAYA'S VOICE	Anyway, like I said, I really loved your novel. Don't give up, Miles. Keep writing. You're really good. Hope you're well. Bye.
