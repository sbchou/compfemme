M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	YOUNG MAN	No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.
M	YOUNG MAN	I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but –
M	YOUNG WOMAN	– but you forget about it in a day or two -
M	YOUNG MAN	– yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?
M	YOUNG MAN	I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	You sound like a duck. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...
M	YOUNG MAN	Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	After tonight.
M	YOUNG MAN	Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
M	WAITRESS	Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Oh yes, thank you.
M	YOUNG MAN	I'm doin' fine.
M	YOUNG MAN	I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Did it work?
M	YOUNG MAN	Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Did they hurt the little girl?
M	YOUNG MAN	I don't know. There probably never was a little girl – the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	You wanna rob banks?
M	YOUNG MAN	I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	So you don't want to be a bank robber?
M	YOUNG MAN	Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	And no more liquor stores?
M	YOUNG MAN	What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
M	YOUNG MAN	I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Well, what else is there, day jobs?
M	YOUNG MAN	Not this life.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Well what then?
M	YOUNG MAN	Garcon! Coffee!
M	YOUNG MAN	This place.
M	WAITRESS	"Garcon" means boy.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Here? It's a coffee shop.
M	YOUNG MAN	What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.
M	YOUNG MAN	Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.
M	YOUNG MAN	See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Yeah.
M	YOUNG MAN	Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Uh-huh.
M	YOUNG MAN	That was a good idea.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Thanks.
M	YOUNG MAN	We made more from the wallets then we did the register.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Yes we did.
M	YOUNG MAN	A lot of people go to restaurants.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	A lot of wallets.
M	YOUNG MAN	Pretty smart, huh?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Pretty smart. I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.
M	YOUNG MAN	Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Got it.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	I love you, Pumpkin.
M	YOUNG MAN	I love you, Honey Bunny.
M	PUMPKIN	Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
M	HONEY BUNNY	Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?
M	JULES	– Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?
M	VINCENT	What so you want to know?
M	JULES	Well, hash is legal there, right?
M	VINCENT	Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
M	JULES	Those are hash bars?
M	VINCENT	Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
M	JULES	That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.
M	VINCENT	You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
M	JULES	What?
M	VINCENT	It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.
M	JULES	Examples?
M	VINCENT	Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
M	JULES	They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
M	VINCENT	No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.
M	JULES	What'd they call it?
M	VINCENT	Royale with Cheese.
M	JULES	Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
M	VINCENT	Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
M	JULES	Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
M	VINCENT	I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
M	JULES	What?
M	VINCENT	Mayonnaise.
M	JULES	Goddamn!
M	VINCENT	I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.
M	JULES	Uuccch!
M	JULES	We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
M	VINCENT	How many up there?
M	JULES	Three or four.
M	VINCENT	Counting our guy?
M	JULES	I'm not sure.
M	VINCENT	So there could be five guys up there?
M	JULES	It's possible.
M	VINCENT	We should have fuckin' shotguns.
M	VINCENT	What's her name?
M	JULES	Mia.
M	VINCENT	How did Marsellus and her meet?
M	JULES	I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.
M	VINCENT	She ever do anything I woulda saw?
M	JULES	I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
M	VINCENT	What's a pilot?
M	JULES	Well, you know the shows on TV?
M	VINCENT	I don't watch TV.
M	JULES	Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?
M	VINCENT	Yeah.
M	JULES	Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
M	JULES	You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.
M	VINCENT	Yeah maybe, fat right?
M	JULES	I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.
M	VINCENT	I think I know who you mean, what about him?
M	JULES	Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
M	VINCENT	What'd he do, fuck her?
M	JULES	No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.
M	VINCENT	Well what then?
M	JULES	He gave her a foot massage.
M	VINCENT	A foot massage?
M	VINCENT	That's all?
M	VINCENT	What did Marsellus do?
M	JULES	Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses – nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.
M	VINCENT	That's a damn shame.
M	VINCENT	Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.
M	JULES	Whaddya mean?
M	VINCENT	You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
M	JULES	You don't think he overreacted?
M	VINCENT	Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
M	JULES	It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.
M	VINCENT	It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out – no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.
M	JULES	Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.
M	VINCENT	Not the same thing, the same ballpark.
M	JULES	It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit.
M	VINCENT	Have you ever given a foot massage?
M	JULES	Don't be tellin' me about foot massages – I'm the foot fuckin' master.
M	VINCENT	Given a lot of 'em?
M	JULES	Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.
M	VINCENT	Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?
M	JULES	Fuck you.
M	VINCENT	How many?
M	JULES	Fuck you.
M	VINCENT	Would you give me a foot massage – I'm kinda tired.
M	JULES	Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed – this is the door.
M	JULES	What time is it?
M	VINCENT	Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
M	JULES	It ain't quite time, let's hang back.
M	JULES	Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.
M	VINCENT	I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.
M	JULES	That's an interesting point, but let's get into character. What's her name again?
M	JULES	Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?
M	VINCENT	Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.
M	JULES	Take care of her?
M	VINCENT	Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.
M	JULES	You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?
M	VINCENT	It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.
M	VINCENT	It's not a date.
M	JULES	Hey kids.
M	JULES	How you boys doin'?
M	JULES	Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.
M	BRETT	We're doin' okay.
M	JULES	Do you know who we are?
M	JULES	We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?
M	JULES	Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?
M	BRETT	I'm Brett.
M	JULES	I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?
M	BRETT	I remember him.
M	JULES	Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?
M	BRETT	Hamburgers.
M	JULES	Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?
M	BRETT	Cheeseburgers.
M	JULES	No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where?
M	BRETT	Big Kahuna Burger.
M	JULES	Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?
M	BRETT	They're good.
M	JULES	Mind if I try one of yours?
M	BRETT	No.
M	JULES	Yours is this one, right?
M	BRETT	Yeah.
M	JULES	Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?
M	VINCENT	No.
M	JULES	You wanna bite, they're real good.
M	VINCENT	I ain't hungry.
M	JULES	Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?
M	BRETT	No.
M	JULES	Tell 'em, Vincent.
M	VINCENT	Royale with Cheese.
M	JULES	Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?
M	BRETT	Because of the metric system?
M	JULES	Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. What's in this?
M	BRETT	Sprite.
M	JULES	Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?
M	BRETT	Sure.
M	JULES	Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?
M	JULES	Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.
M	MARVIN	It's under the be –
M	JULES	– I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing. You were sayin'?
M	ROGER	It's under the bed.
M	VINCENT	Got it.
M	JULES	We happy?
M	JULES	Vincent!
M	JULES	We happy?
M	VINCENT	We're happy.
M	BRETT	Look, what's your name? I got his name's Vincent, but what's yours?
M	JULES	My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit.
M	BRETT	I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace. When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions –
M	JULES	Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about "best intentions."
M	JULES	Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?
M	JULES	What country you from!
M	BRETT	What?
M	JULES	"What" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in "What?"
M	BRETT	What?
M	JULES	English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?
M	BRETT	Yes.
M	JULES	Then you understand what I'm sayin'?
M	BRETT	Yes.
M	JULES	Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
M	BRETT	What?
M	JULES	Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say "What" one more goddamn time!
M	JULES	Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
M	BRETT	Well he's... he's... black –
M	JULES	– go on!
M	BRETT	...and he's... he's... bald –
M	JULES	– does he look like a bitch?!
M	BRETT	What?
M	JULES	Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!
M	BRETT	No.
M	JULES	Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!
M	BRETT	I didn't.
M	JULES	Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?
M	BRETT	Yes.
M	JULES	There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	I think you're gonna find – when all this shit is over and done – I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last. Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about. This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine. Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather-weight champion of the world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps. Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus Wallace was right."
F	BUTCH	I got no problem with that.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	In the fifth, your ass goes down.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	Say it!
F	BUTCH	In the fifth, my ass goes down.
M	ENGLISH DAVE	Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here.
M	VINCENT	Where's the big man?
M	ENGLISH DAVE	He's over there, finishing up some business.
M	ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)	Hang back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over. In the meanwhile, can I make you an espresso?
M	VINCENT	How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American?
M	ENGLISH DAVE	Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow?
M	VINCENT	At Marsellus' request.
M	ENGLISH DAVE	Have you met Mia?
M	VINCENT	Not yet.
M	VINCENT	What's so funny?
M	ENGLISH DAVE	Not a goddamn thing.
M	VINCENT	Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.
M	ENGLISH DAVE	My name's Paul, and this is between y'all.
F	BUTCH	Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?
M	ENGLISH DAVE	Filters?
F	BUTCH	Non.
F	BUTCH	Lookin' at somethin', friend?
M	VINCENT	I ain't your friend, palooka.
F	BUTCH	What was that?
M	VINCENT	I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	Vincent Vega has entered the building, git your ass over here! Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.
F	JODY	...I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on body piercing.
F	TRUDI	You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?
F	JODY	Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle. Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril. One through my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud in my tongue.
M	VINCENT	Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?
F	JODY	It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
M	LANCE (O.S.)	Vince, you can come in now!
M	LANCE	Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. Now the first two are the same, forty- five an ounce – those are friend prices – but this one... ...this one's a little more expensive. It's fifty-five. But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went. Nothing wrong with the first two. It's real, real, real, good shit. But this one's a fuckin' madman.
M	VINCENT	Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
M	LANCE	Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No. You're in my house. White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. My shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week.
M	VINCENT	That's a bold statement.
M	LANCE	This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell.
M	VINCENT	Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand.
M	LANCE	I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?
M	VINCENT	Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?
M	LANCE	No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
M	VINCENT	I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?
M	LANCE	No problem?
M	VINCENT	You don't mind if I shoot up here?
M	LANCE	Me casa, su casa.
M	VINCENT	Mucho gracias.
M	LANCE	Still got your Malibu?
M	VINCENT	You know what some fucker did to it the other day?
M	LANCE	What?
M	VINCENT	Fuckin' keyed it.
M	LANCE	Oh man, that's fucked up.
M	VINCENT	Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days – five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it.
M	LANCE	They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
M	VINCENT	I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?
M	LANCE	It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle.
M	MIA (V.O.)	Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.
M	VINCENT	Hello?
F	MIA	Vincent.
F	MIA	Vincent. I'm on the intercom.
F	MIA	It's on the wall by the two African fellas.
F	MIA	To your right.
F	MIA	...warm. Warmer. Disco.
M	VINCENT	Hello.
F	MIA	Push the button if you want to talk.
M	VINCENT	Hello.
F	MIA	Go make yourself a drink., and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
F	MIA	The bar's by the fireplace.
M	VINCENT	Okay.
F	MIA	Let's go.
M	VINCENT	What the fuck is this place?
F	MIA	This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis man should love it.
M	VINCENT	Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.
F	MIA	You can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don't be a...
M	VINCENT	After you, kitty-cat.
M	BUDDY	Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?
M	VINCENT	I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
M	BUDDY	How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell?
M	VINCENT	Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke.
M	BUDDY	How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?
F	MIA	I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger – bloody – and a five-dollar shake.
M	BUDDY	How d'ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?
F	MIA	Martin and Lewis.
M	VINCENT	Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
F	MIA	Sure did.
M	VINCENT	A shake? Milk and ice cream?
F	MIA	Uh-huh.
M	VINCENT	It costs five dollars?
M	BUDDY	Yep.
M	VINCENT	You don't put bourbon in it or anything?
M	BUDDY	Nope.
M	VINCENT	Just checking.
F	MIA	Whaddya think?
M	VINCENT	It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.
F	MIA	What are you doing?
M	VINCENT	Rollin' a smoke.
F	MIA	Here?
M	VINCENT	It's just tobacco.
F	MIA	Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy?
M	VINCENT	You can have this one, cowgirl.
F	MIA	Thanks.
M	VINCENT	Think nothing of it.
F	MIA	Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.
M	VINCENT	Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
F	MIA	That was my fifteen minutes.
M	VINCENT	What was it?
F	MIA	It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
M	VINCENT	What?
F	MIA	"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex...
M	VINCENT	What was your specialty?
F	MIA	Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist – when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.
M	VINCENT	Do you remember any of the jokes?
F	MIA	Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.
M	VINCENT	Tell me.
F	MIA	No. It's really corny.
M	VINCENT	C'mon, don't be that way.
F	MIA	No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.
M	VINCENT	You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.
F	MIA	That's what I'm afraid of.
M	VINCENT	That's not what I meant and you know it.
F	MIA	You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?
M	VINCENT	I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
F	MIA	That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.
M	VINCENT	What a gyp.
F	MIA	Yummy!
M	VINCENT	Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
F	MIA	Be my guest.
F	MIA	You can use my straw, I don't have kooties.
M	VINCENT	Yeah, but maybe I do.
F	MIA	Kooties I can handle.
M	VINCENT	Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake.
F	MIA	Told ya.
M	VINCENT	I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.
F	MIA	Don't you hate that?
M	VINCENT	What?
F	MIA	Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
M	VINCENT	I don't know.
F	MIA	That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.
M	VINCENT	I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.
F	MIA	Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.
M	VINCENT	I'll do that.
F	MIA	I said goddamn!
F	MIA	bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?
M	VINCENT	We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
F	MIA	Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.
M	VINCENT	No there's not.
M	VINCENT	That's Marilyn Monroe...
M	VINCENT	... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.
F	MIA	Pretty smart.
M	VINCENT	I have moments.
F	MIA	Did ya think of something to say?
M	VINCENT	Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.
F	MIA	Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.
M	VINCENT	Only if you promise not to get offended.
F	MIA	You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
M	VINCENT	Then let's just forget it.
F	MIA	That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
M	VINCENT	Is that a fact?
F	MIA	Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.
M	VINCENT	What do you think about what happened to Antwan?
F	MIA	Who's Antwan?
M	VINCENT	Tony Rocky Horror.
F	MIA	He fell out of a window.
M	VINCENT	That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
F	MIA	Is that a fact?
M	VINCENT	No it's not, it's just what I heard.
F	MIA	Who told you this?
M	VINCENT	They.
F	MIA	They talk a lot, don't they?
M	VINCENT	They certainly do.
F	MIA	Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?
F	MIA	Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?
M	VINCENT	No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.
F	MIA	And...?
M	VINCENT	No and, that's it.
F	MIA	You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?
M	VINCENT	Yeah.
F	MIA	And you believed that?
M	VINCENT	At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.
F	MIA	Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
M	VINCENT	No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.
F	MIA	A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
M	VINCENT	But did it happen?
F	MIA	The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.
M	ED SULLIVAN	Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
M	ED SULLIVAN	...One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.
M	ED SULLIVAN	...Now, who will be our first contestants?
F	MIA	Right here.
F	MIA	I wanna dance.
M	VINCENT	No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.
F	MIA	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy.
M	VINCENT	All right.
F	MIA	So, dance good.
M	VINCENT	All right, you asked for it.
M	ED SULLIVAN	Let's hear it for our first contestants.
M	ED SULLIVAN	Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name?
F	MIA	Missus Mia Wallace.
M	ED SULLIVAN	And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?
F	MIA	Vincent Vega.
M	ED SULLIVAN	All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away!
M	VINCENT	Was than an uncomfortable silence?
F	MIA	I don't know what that was. Music and drinks!
M	VINCENT	I'm gonna take a piss.
F	MIA	That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but go right ahead.
F	MIA	Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.
M	VINCENT	One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.
M	VINCENT	...It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.
M	VINCENT	So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening," go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.
M	VINCENT	Jesus Christ!
M	VINCENT	Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
M	VINCENT	I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?
M	VINCENT	Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.
M	VINCENT	We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.
M	PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)	Hold hands, you love birds.
M	JODY (O.S.)	Lance! The phone's ringing!
M	LANCE	I can hear it! I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late!
M	LANCE	I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now! Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late.
M	VINCENT	Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.
M	LANCE	Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem?
M	VINCENT	You still got an adrenaline shot?
M	LANCE	Maybe.
M	VINCENT	I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin' Doing on me.
M	LANCE	Don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house!
M	VINCENT	No choice.
M	LANCE	She's ODin'?
M	VINCENT	Yeah. She's dyin'.
M	LANCE	Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!
M	VINCENT	Negative.
M	LANCE	She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it – are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?
M	VINCENT	Sorry.
M	LANCE	I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up.
M	VINCENT	Too late, I'm already here.
M	JODY (O.S.)	What the hell was that?
M	LANCE	Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone –
M	VINCENT	If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!
M	LANCE	Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house!
M	VINCENT	This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.
F	JODY	It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here?
F	JODY	Who's she?
M	LANCE	Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenaline shot.
F	JODY	What's wrong with her?
M	VINCENT	She's ODing on us.
F	JODY	Well get her the hell outta here!
M	LANCE AND VINCENT	Get the fuckin' shot!
F	JODY	Don't yell and me!
M	VINCENT	You two are a match made in heaven.
M	LANCE	Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book. What do you need a medical book for?
M	LANCE	To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenaline shot before.
M	VINCENT	You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?
M	LANCE	I never had to use it. I don't go joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs!
M	VINCENT	Well then get it.
M	LANCE	I am, if you'll let me.
M	VINCENT	I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
M	LANCE	Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her.
M	VINCENT (O.S.)	Hurry up man! We're losin' her!
M	LANCE	I'm looking as fast as I can!
M	JODY (O.S.)	What's he lookin' for?
M	VINCENT (O.S.)	I dunno, some medical book.
M	JODY (O.S.)	What are you lookin' for?
M	LANCE	My black medical book!
F	JODY	Whata're you looking for?
M	LANCE	My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.
F	JODY	I never saw a medical book.
M	LANCE	Trust me, I have one.
F	JODY	Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?
M	LANCE	I don't know! Stop bothering me!
F	JODY	While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit. For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room – – get your ass in here, fuck the book!
M	VINCENT	Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!
M	LANCE	While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.
M	VINCENT	Does it have to be exact?
M	LANCE	Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.
M	VINCENT	Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.
M	LANCE	That's it.
M	VINCENT	I need a big fat magic marker, got one?
F	JODY	What?
M	VINCENT	I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great.
F	JODY	Hold on.
M	LANCE	It's ready, I'll tell you what to do.
M	VINCENT	You're gonna give her the shot.
M	LANCE	No, you're gonna give her the shot.
M	VINCENT	I've never does this before.
M	LANCE	I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot.
F	JODY	Got it.
M	VINCENT	Okay, what do I do?
M	LANCE	Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
M	VINCENT	I gotta stab her?
M	LANCE	If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard.
M	VINCENT	What happens after that?
M	LANCE	I'm curious about that myself.
M	VINCENT	This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
M	LANCE	She's supposed to come out of it like – – that.
M	VINCENT	Count to three.
M	LANCE	One...
M	LANCE (O.S.)	...two...
M	LANCE (O.S.)	...three!
M	LANCE	If you're okay, say something.
F	MIA	Something.
F	JODY	Anybody want a beer?
M	VINCENT (O.S.)	Mia!
M	VINCENT	What are your thoughts on how to handle this?
F	MIA	What's yours?
M	VINCENT	Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.
F	MIA	Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.
M	VINCENT	I seriously doubt that.
F	MIA	If you can keep a secret, so can I.
M	VINCENT	Let's shake on it.
M	VINCENT	Mum's the word.
M	VINCENT	If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.
F	MIA	You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE FIVE" joke?
M	VINCENT	Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
F	MIA	Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.
M	VINCENT	I can't wait.
F	MIA	Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him – – and says: catch up.
F	MIA	See ya 'round, Vince.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Butch.
M	MOTHER	Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?
M	BUTCH (O.S.)	Uh-huh.
M	MOTHER	Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
M	CAPT. KOONS	Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy's. We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together. Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim. But the way it worked out is I'm talkin' to you, Butch. I got somethin' for ya.
M	CAPT. KOONS	This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.
M	KLONDIKE	It's time, Butch.
F	BUTCH	I'm ready.
M	SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)	– Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen.
M	SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)	...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead?
M	SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)	My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing. I think any man would've left the ring that fast. Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing?
M	SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)	Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation. But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –
M	ESMARELDA	Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?
F	BUTCH	If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up.
M	ESMARELDA	Where to?
F	BUTCH	Outta here.
M	VINCENT	Mia. How you doin'?
F	MIA	Great. I never thanked you for the dinner.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	What'cha got?
M	ENGLISH DAVE	He booked.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.
M	ENGLISH DAVE	I'll take care of it.
F	BUTCH	Hey, how do I open the window back here?
M	ESMARELDA	I have to do it.
M	ESMARELDA	Hey, mister?
F	BUTCH	What?
M	ESMARELDA	You were in that fight? The fight on the radio – you're the fighter?
F	BUTCH	Whatever gave you that idea?
M	ESMARELDA	No c'mon, you're him, I know you're him, tell me you're him.
F	BUTCH	I'm him.
M	ESMARELDA	You killed the other boxing man.
F	BUTCH	He's dead?
M	ESMARELDA	The radio said he was dead.
F	BUTCH	Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.
M	ESMARELDA	What does it feel like?
F	BUTCH	What does what feel like?
M	ESMARELDA	Killing a man. Beating another man to death with your bare hands.
F	BUTCH	Are you some kinda weirdo?
M	ESMARELDA	No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?
F	BUTCH	Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, I'll give you an answer.
M	ESMARELDA	Deal!
F	BUTCH	So...
F	BUTCH	...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that Mexican?
M	ESMARELDA	The name is Spanish, but I'm Columbian.
F	BUTCH	It's a very pretty name.
M	ESMARELDA	It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."
F	BUTCH	That's one hell of a name you got there, sister.
M	ESMARELDA	Thank you. And what is your name?
F	BUTCH	Butch.
M	ESMARELDA	Butch. What does it mean?
F	BUTCH	I'm an American, our names don't mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?
M	ESMARELDA	I want to know what it feels like to kill a man –
F	BUTCH	– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead. Now I know he's dead, do you wanna know how I feel about it?
F	BUTCH	I don't feel the least little bit bad.
F	BUTCH	What'd I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive. If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive. Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch. How many bookies you spread it around with? Eight? How long to collect? So by tomorrow evening, you'll have it all? Good news Scotty, real good news – I understand a few stragglers aside. Me an' Fabienne're gonna leave in the morning. It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it'll be on Tennessee time.
F	BUTCH	Fabienne my love, our adventure begins.
M	ESMARELDA	Forty-five sixty.
F	BUTCH	Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort.
F	BUTCH	Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?
M	ESMARELDA	The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans.
F	BUTCH	Bon soir, Esmarelda.
M	ESMARELDA	Sleep well, Butch.
F	FABIENNE	Keep the light off.
F	BUTCH	Is that better, sugar pop?
F	FABIENNE	Oui. Hard day at the office?
F	BUTCH	Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
F	FABIENNE	Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
F	FABIENNE	I was looking at myself in the mirror.
F	BUTCH	Uh-huh?
F	FABIENNE	I wish I had a pot.
F	BUTCH	You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?
F	FABIENNE	A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.
F	BUTCH	Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.
F	FABIENNE	Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star," it's not the same thing.
F	BUTCH	I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.
F	FABIENNE	The difference is huge.
F	BUTCH	You want me to have a pot?
F	FABIENNE	No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.
F	BUTCH	You think guys would find that attractive?
F	FABIENNE	I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.
F	BUTCH	If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in it.
F	FABIENNE	You'd punch me in my belly?
F	BUTCH	Right in the belly.
F	FABIENNE	I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.
F	BUTCH	You'd do that to me?
F	FABIENNE	Yes!
F	BUTCH	Did you get everything, sugar pop?
F	FABIENNE	Yes, I did.
F	BUTCH	Good job.
F	FABIENNE	Did everything go as planned?
F	BUTCH	You didn't listen to the radio?
F	FABIENNE	I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?
F	BUTCH	I won alright.
F	FABIENNE	Are you still retiring?
F	BUTCH	Sure am.
F	FABIENNE	What about the man you fought?
F	BUTCH	Floyd retired too.
F	FABIENNE	Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!
F	BUTCH	Not no more.
F	FABIENNE	So it all worked out in the finish?
F	BUTCH	We ain't at the finish, baby.
F	FABIENNE	We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
F	FABIENNE	If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?
F	FABIENNE	But they won't find us, will they?
F	FABIENNE	Do you still want me to go with you?
F	FABIENNE	I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance -
F	FABIENNE	Say it!
F	BUTCH	Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
F	FABIENNE	Forever?
F	BUTCH	...and ever.
F	FABIENNE	Do you love me?
F	BUTCH	Oui.
F	FABIENNE	Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
F	BUTCH	Will you kiss it?
F	FABIENNE	But you first.
F	FABIENNE	Butch my love, the adventure begins.
F	BUTCH	I think I cracked a rib.
F	FABIENNE	Giving me oral pleasure?
F	BUTCH	No retard, from the fight.
F	FABIENNE	Don't call me retard.
F	BUTCH	My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
F	FABIENNE	Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice.
F	BUTCH	Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back! Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.
F	FABIENNE	Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid.
F	BUTCH	I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back.
F	BUTCH	Merci beaucoup.
F	FABIENNE	Butch?
F	BUTCH	Yes, lemon pie.
F	FABIENNE	Where are we going to go?
F	BUTCH	I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there.
F	FABIENNE	So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
F	BUTCH	You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
F	FABIENNE	But I do not speak Spanish.
F	BUTCH	You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria?
F	FABIENNE	What does that mean?
F	BUTCH	Where's the shoe store?
F	FABIENNE	Donde esta el zapataria?
F	BUTCH	Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time.
M	BUTCH (O.S.)	Que hora es?
F	FABIENNE	Que hora es? What time is it?
F	FABIENNE	What time is it?
M	BUTCH (O.S.)	Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
F	FABIENNE	Butch.
F	FABIENNE	Forget it.
F	FABIENNE	Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?
F	BUTCH	What are you watching?
F	FABIENNE	A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.
F	BUTCH	Are you watchin' it?
F	FABIENNE	In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off?
F	BUTCH	Would you please?
F	BUTCH	It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.
F	FABIENNE	What was it about?
F	BUTCH	How should I know, you were the one watchin' it.
F	FABIENNE	No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
F	BUTCH	Oh, I... don't remember. It's really rare I remember a dream.
F	FABIENNE	You just woke up from it.
F	BUTCH	Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember.
F	FABIENNE	Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?
F	BUTCH	I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?
F	FABIENNE	You did last night.
F	BUTCH	What did I say?
F	FABIENNE	I don't know. I couldn't understand you.
F	FABIENNE	Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.
F	BUTCH	One more kiss and I'll get up.
F	FABIENNE	Satisfied?
F	BUTCH	Yep.
F	FABIENNE	Then get up, lazy bones.
F	BUTCH	What time is it?
F	FABIENNE	Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?
F	BUTCH	Eleven.
F	FABIENNE	I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.
F	BUTCH	Anything to drink with that?
F	FABIENNE	Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
F	BUTCH	Pie for breakfast?
F	FABIENNE	Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese –
F	BUTCH	– where's my watch?
F	FABIENNE	It's there.
F	BUTCH	No, it's not. It's not here.
F	FABIENNE	Have you looked?
F	BUTCH	Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
F	BUTCH	What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?
F	FABIENNE	Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
F	BUTCH	– on the little kangaroo.
F	FABIENNE	Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
F	BUTCH	Well it's not here!
F	FABIENNE	Well it should be!
F	BUTCH	Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?
F	BUTCH	Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?... I don't wanna get into it right now... but he went through a lot. Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?
F	FABIENNE	I believe so...
F	BUTCH	You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?
F	FABIENNE	Then I did.
F	BUTCH	Are you sure?
F	FABIENNE	No.
F	BUTCH	No! It's not your fault. You left it at the apartment.
F	BUTCH	If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader.
F	FABIENNE	I'm sorry.
F	BUTCH	Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.
F	FABIENNE	Why does it mean that?
F	BUTCH	Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.
F	FABIENNE	Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?
F	BUTCH	That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split.
F	FABIENNE	I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
F	BUTCH	Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. I love you, remember? Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast.
F	FABIENNE	Don't go.
F	BUTCH	I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie.
F	FABIENNE	Blueberry pie.
F	BUTCH	Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay? Okay?
F	FABIENNE	Okay.
F	BUTCH	Bye-bye, sugar pop.
F	FABIENNE	Bye.
F	BUTCH	I'm gonna take your Honda.
F	FABIENNE	Okay.
F	BUTCH	Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. "Bedside table – on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."
F	BUTCH	Holy shit.
F	BUTCH	That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin' ya.
M	PEDESTRIAN	Jesus, are you okay?
F	BUTCH	I guess.
M	GAWKER #1	He's dead! He's dead!
M	GAWKER #2	If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car.
M	MARSELLUS	Who?
M	GAWKER #2	Him.
M	MARSELLUS	Well, I'll be damned.
F	BUTCH	Sacre bleu.
M	LOOKY-LOO WOMAN	Oh my God, I've been shot!
M	MAYNARD	Can I help you wit' somethin'?
F	BUTCH	Shut up!
M	MAYNARD	Now you just wait one goddamn minute
F	BUTCH	So you like chasing people, huh?
F	BUTCH	Well guess what, big man, you caught me – – hold it right there, godammit!
F	BUTCH	Look mister, this ain't any of your business –
M	MAYNARD	– I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun!
M	MAYNARD	Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.
M	MAYNARD	Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies. Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.
M	MAYNARD	That's Zed.
M	ZED	You said you waited for me?
M	MAYNARD	I did.
M	ZED	Then how come they're all beat up?
M	MAYNARD	They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.
M	ZED	You were gonna shoot him?
M	ZED	Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this place?
M	MAYNARD	Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
M	ZED	No, it's Thursday.
M	MAYNARD	Then she'll be fine.
M	ZED	Bring out The Gimp.
M	MAYNARD	I think The Gimp's sleepin'.
M	ZED	Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?
M	MAYNARD	Wake up!
M	MAYNARD	Down!
M	MAYNARD	Who's first?
M	ZED	I ain't fer sure yet.
M	ZED	Wanna do it here?
M	MAYNARD	Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.
M	MAYNARD	Up!
M	MAYNARD	Keep an eye on this one.
M	MAYNARD (O.S.)	Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!
M	ZED (O.S.)	You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight!
M	MAYNARD (O.S.)	That's it... that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that... that's good. Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!
M	THE GIMP	Huhng?
F	BUTCH	Hey hillbilly.
F	BUTCH	You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
M	MARSELLUS (O.S.)	Step aside, Butch.
F	BUTCH	You okay?
M	MARSELLUS	Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!
F	BUTCH	What now?
M	MARSELLUS	What now? Well let me tell you what now. I'm gonna call a couple pipe- hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on your ass.
F	BUTCH	I meant what now, between me and you?
M	MARSELLUS	Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you. There is no me an' you. Not no more.
F	BUTCH	So we're cool?
M	MARSELLUS	Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask – two things I ask: Don't tell nobody about this. This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'- the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in- agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you're gone, stay gone. You've lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?
F	BUTCH	Deal.
M	MARSELLUS	Go on now, get your ass outta here.
M	MARSELLUS	Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta bit of a situation.
M	FABIENNE (O.S.)	Butch, I was so worried!
F	BUTCH	Honey, grab your radio and your purse and let's go! But what about all our bags?
F	BUTCH	Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train if we don't split now.
M	FABIENNE (O.S.)	Is everything well? Are we in danger?
F	BUTCH	We're cool. In fact, we're super- cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait for you outside.
F	FABIENNE	Where did you get this motorcycle?
F	BUTCH	It's a chopper, baby, hop on.
F	FABIENNE	What happened to my Honda?
F	BUTCH	Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
F	FABIENNE	You're hurt?
F	BUTCH	I might've broke my nose, no biggie. Hop on.
F	BUTCH	Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
F	BUTCH	I'm sorry, baby-love.
F	FABIENNE	You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.
F	BUTCH	I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast?
F	FABIENNE	It was good –
F	BUTCH	– did you get the blueberry pancakes?
F	FABIENNE	No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk – are you sure you're okay?
F	BUTCH	Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about it.
F	FABIENNE	Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
F	BUTCH	It's a chopper.
F	FABIENNE	Whose chopper is this?
F	BUTCH	Zed's.
F	FABIENNE	Who's Zed?
F	BUTCH	Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.
M	JULES (O.S.)	You ever read the Bible, Brett? Yes!
M	JULES (O.S.)	There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men..."
M	JULES (O.S.)	"...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."
M	VINCENT (O.S.)	Friend of yours?
M	JULES (O.S.)	Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.
M	FOURTH MAN	Die... die... die... die...!
M	FOURTH MAN	I don't understand –
M	VINCENT	Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
M	JULES	We should be fuckin' dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.
M	VINCENT	
M	JULES	We should be fuckin' dead!
M	VINCENT	Yeah, we were lucky.
M	JULES	That shit wasn't luck. That shit was somethin' else.
M	VINCENT	Yeah, maybe.
M	JULES	That was... divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?
M	VINCENT	Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
M	JULES	Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
M	VINCENT	I think we should be going now.
M	JULES	Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!
M	VINCENT	Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.
M	JULES	Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.
M	VINCENT	Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?
M	JULES	We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!
M	VINCENT	Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?
M	VINCENT	...Ever seen that show "COPS?" I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens.
M	JULES	If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
M	VINCENT	What the fuck does that mean?
M	JULES	That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.
M	VINCENT	Jesus Christ!
M	JULES	Don't blaspheme!
M	VINCENT	Goddammit, Jules –
M	JULES	– I said don't do that –
M	VINCENT	– you're fuckin' freakin' out!
M	JULES	I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.
M	VINCENT	While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why.
M	JULES	Don't worry, I will.
M	VINCENT	I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.
M	JULES	I don't give a damn if he does.
M	VINCENT	Marvin, what do you make of all this?
M	MARVIN	I don't even have an opinion.
M	VINCENT	C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?
M	JULES	What the fuck's happening?
M	VINCENT	I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.
M	JULES	Why the fuck did you do that?
M	VINCENT	I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.
M	JULES	I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time –
M	VINCENT	– chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off.
M	JULES	The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!
M	VINCENT	Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how!
M	JULES	Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight –
M	VINCENT	– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter.
M	JULES	Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood.
M	VINCENT	Can't we just take it to a friendly place?
M	JULES	This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley.
M	VINCENT	Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules.
M	VINCENT	Who ya callin'?
M	JULES	A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.
M	VINCENT	Where's Toluca Lake.
M	JULES	On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
M	JULES	We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
M	VINCENT	If he kicks us out, whadda we do?
M	JULES	Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.
M	VINCENT	Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
M	JULES	Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.
M	VINCENT	If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.
M	JULES	What the fuck did you just do to his towel?
M	VINCENT	I was just dryin' my hands.
M	JULES	You're supposed to wash 'em first.
M	VINCENT	You watched me wash 'em.
M	JULES	I watched you get 'em wet.
M	VINCENT	I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.
M	JULES	I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.
M	JULES	Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him.
M	JULES	Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?
M	JIMMIE	Knock it off, Julie.
M	JULES	What?
M	JIMMIE	I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.
M	JULES	Jimmie –
M	JIMMIE	– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, "Dead nigger storage?"
M	JIMMIE	– answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage?"
M	JULES	Naw man, I didn't.
M	JIMMIE	You know why you didn't see that sign?
M	JULES	Why?
M	JIMMIE	'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business!
M	JIMMIE	– I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation – fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it.
M	JULES	Jimmie –
M	JIMMIE	– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house.
M	JULES	That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit. We just need to call our people to bring us in.
M	JIMMIE	Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom.
M	MARSELLUS	...well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do? No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't. How bad, a lot or a little?
M	JULES	You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.
M	MARSELLUS	I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs."
M	JULES	I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna hear from your ass is: "you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly."
M	MARSELLUS	You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly.
M	JULES	You sendin' The Wolf?
M	MARSELLUS	Feel better?
M	JULES	Shit Negro, that's all you had to say.
M	THE WOLF	Is she the hysterical type? When she due? Give me the principals' names again? Jules...
M	THE WOLF	...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...
M	THE WOLF	Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.
M	THE WOLF	You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?
M	JIMMIE	Yeah.
M	THE WOLF	I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.
M	JIMMIE	Good, 'cause we got one.
M	THE WOLF	So I heard. May I come in?
M	JIMMIE	Please do.
M	THE WOLF	You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?
M	JIMMIE	
M	THE WOLF	Your wife, Bonnie... ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?
M	JIMMIE	Uh-huh.
M	THE WOLF	I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much.
M	JIMMIE	She won't at that.
M	THE WOLF	That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
M	THE WOLF	Jimmie?
M	JIMMIE	Yes.
M	THE WOLF	Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?
M	JIMMIE	Sure, how do you take it?
M	THE WOLF	Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
M	THE WOLF	About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?
M	JULES	Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
M	THE WOLF	Positive? Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
M	JULES	Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.
M	THE WOLF	Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen.
M	THE WOLF	Thank you, Jimmie.
M	THE WOLF	Okay first thing, you two. Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?
M	JIMMIE	Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink. Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery – now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. But the windows are a different story. Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.
M	VINCENT	A "please" would be nice.
M	THE WOLF	Come again?
M	VINCENT	I said a "please" would be nice.
M	THE WOLF	Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say "please."I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.
M	JULES	It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.
M	VINCENT	I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
M	THE WOLF	If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
M	THE WOLF	It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin', except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon. How we comin', Jimmie?
M	JIMMIE	Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' –
M	THE WOLF	– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.
M	JIMMIE	You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore –
M	THE WOLF	– let me ask you a question, if you don't mind?
M	JIMMIE	Sure.
M	THE WOLF	Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires?
M	JIMMIE	No.
M	THE WOLF	Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do. I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?
M	JIMMIE	Oak's nice.
M	JULES	I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!
M	VINCENT	Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?
M	JULES	Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.
M	VINCENT	I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.
M	JULES	You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.
M	THE WOLF	Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet.
M	JIMMIE	I can't believe that's the same car.
M	THE WOLF	Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two.
M	THE WOLF	Strip.
M	VINCENT	All the way?
M	THE WOLF	To your bare ass.
M	THE WOLF	Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better- half comes pulling into the driveway.
M	JULES	This morning air is some chilly shit.
M	VINCENT	Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
M	THE WOLF	You know what you two look like?
M	VINCENT	What?
M	THE WOLF	Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag.
M	JULES	Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.
M	THE WOLF	Don't worry, we're takin' it with us. Jim, the soap.
M	THE WOLF	Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.
M	JULES	Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!
M	THE WOLF	Better you than me, gentlemen.
M	THE WOLF	Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it around.
M	THE WOLF	Towel 'em.
M	THE WOLF	You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes.
M	THE WOLF	Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've planned this better. You guys look like... what do they look like, Jimmie?
M	JIMMIE	Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
M	JULES	Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.
M	JIMMIE	I guess you just gotta know how to wear them.
M	JULES	Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is.
M	THE WOLF	C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison. Don't make me beg.
M	THE WOLF	Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma. The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me. Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. What did I say?
M	JULES	Don't do shit unless –
M	THE WOLF	– unless what?
M	JULES	Unless you do it first.
M	THE WOLF	Spoken like a true prodigy. How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
M	VINCENT	I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.
M	THE WOLF	Fair enough. I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.
M	JULES	We cool?
F	WINSTON	Like it never happened.
F	WINSTON	Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all this will be hers.
F	RAQUEL	Hi. You know, if they ever do "I SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, I'd be great. What's with the outfits. You guys going to a volleyball game?
F	WINSTON	I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. Maybe I can drop you two off. Where do you live?
M	VINCENT	Redondo Beach.
M	JULES	Inglewood.
F	WINSTON	It's your future: I see... a cab ride. Sorry guys, move out of the sticks. Say goodbye, Raquel.
F	RAQUEL	Goodbye, Raquel.
F	WINSTON	I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
M	JULES	Mr. Wolf.
M	JULES	I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
F	WINSTON	Call me Winston.
F	WINSTON	You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character.
F	RAQUEL	I have character.
F	WINSTON	Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.
F	RAQUEL	Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny.
M	JULES	Wanna share a cab?
M	VINCENT	You know I could go for some breakfast. Want to have breakfast with me?
M	JULES	Sure.
M	VINCENT	Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?
M	JULES	Naw, I don't eat pork.
M	VINCENT	Are you Jewish?
M	JULES	I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine.
M	VINCENT	Why not?
M	JULES	They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
M	VINCENT	Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.
M	JULES	A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.
M	VINCENT	How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.
M	JULES	I don't eat dog either.
M	VINCENT	Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
M	JULES	I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.
M	VINCENT	So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?
M	JULES	We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
M	VINCENT	Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.
M	JULES	I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
M	VINCENT	About what?
M	JULES	The miracle we witnessed.
M	VINCENT	The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.
M	JULES	Do you know that a miracle is?
M	VINCENT	An act of God.
M	JULES	What's an act of God?
M	VINCENT	I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.
M	JULES	Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.
M	VINCENT	But why?
M	JULES	That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.
M	VINCENT	So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?
M	JULES	The life, most definitely.
M	PATRON	Garcon! Coffee!
M	VINCENT	So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?
M	JULES	That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
M	VINCENT	What do you mean, walk the earth?
M	JULES	You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.
M	VINCENT	How long do you intend to walk the earth?
M	JULES	Until God puts me where he want me to be.
M	VINCENT	What if he never does?
M	JULES	If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.
M	VINCENT	So you decided to be a bum?
M	JULES	I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no less.
M	VINCENT	No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be – a fuckin' bum!
M	JULES	Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ –
M	VINCENT	– what happened was peculiar – no doubt about it – but it wasn't water into wine.
M	JULES	All shapes and sizes, Vince.
M	VINCENT	Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
M	JULES	If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.
M	VINCENT	I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
M	PUMPKIN	Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
M	HONEY BUNNY	Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?!
M	PUMPKIN	Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.
M	HONEY BUNNY	Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!
M	PUMPKIN	You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! Asta luego!
M	PUMPKIN	On the floor or I'll cook you ass, comprende?
M	MANAGER	I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all –
M	PUMPKIN	You're gonna give me a problem?
M	PUMPKIN	What? You said you're gonna give me a problem?
M	MANAGER	No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any problem!
M	PUMPKIN	I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!
M	HONEY BUNNY	Don't take any chances. Execute him!
M	MANAGER	Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.
M	PUMPKIN	Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.
M	MANAGER	Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!
M	PUMPKIN	Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.
M	PUMPKIN	Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
M	PUMPKIN	In the bag.
M	PUMPKIN	What's in that?
M	JULES	My boss' dirty laundry.
M	PUMPKIN	You boss makes you do his laundry?
M	JULES	When he wants it clean.
M	PUMPKIN	Sounds like a shit job.
M	JULES	Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.
M	PUMPKIN	Open it up.
M	JULES	'Fraid I can't do that.
M	PUMPKIN	I didn't hear you.
M	JULES	Yes, you did.
M	HONEY BUNNY	What's goin' on?
M	PUMPKIN	Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
M	HONEY BUNNY	Shoot 'em in the face!
M	JULES	I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.
M	PUMPKIN	You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.
M	MANAGER	Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.
M	JULES	Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!
M	PUMPKIN	I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One...
M	PUMPKIN	...two... three.
M	JULES	You win.
M	JULES	It's all yours, Ringo.
M	PUMPKIN	Open it.
M	HONEY BUNNY	What is it? What is it?
M	PUMPKIN	Is that what I think it is?
M	PUMPKIN	It's beautiful.
M	HONEY BUNNY	Goddammit, what is it?
M	HONEY BUNNY	Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!
M	JULES	Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!
M	PUMPKIN	Chill out, honey!
M	HONEY BUNNY	Let him go!
M	JULES	Tell her it's gonna be okay.
M	PUMPKIN	I'm gonna be okay.
M	JULES	Promise her.
M	PUMPKIN	I promise.
M	JULES	Tell her to chill.
M	PUMPKIN	Just chill out.
M	JULES	What's her name?
M	PUMPKIN	Yolanda.
M	JULES	So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?
M	YOLANDA	Don't you hurt him.
M	JULES	Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?
M	JULES	C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?
M	YOLANDA	He's cool?
M	JULES	Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool. Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?
M	JULES	One... two... three.
M	YOLANDA	Okay, now let him go!
M	JULES	Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.
M	YOLANDA	Just know: you hurt him, you die.
M	JULES	That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do. Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass. What the fuck's goin' on here?
M	JULES	It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'. Tell her we're still cool.
M	PUMPKIN	It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool.
M	VINCENT	What the hell's goin' on, Jules?
M	JULES	Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.
M	VINCENT	Check.
M	JULES	Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
M	YOLANDA	I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
M	JULES	Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I. It's almost over. Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
M	PUMPKIN	Which one is it?
M	JULES	It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.
M	JULES	That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?
M	PUMPKIN	About fifteen hundred dollars.
M	JULES	Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.
M	VINCENT	Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.
M	JULES	You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
M	PUMPKIN	What?
M	JULES	Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?
M	PUMPKIN	Not regularly.
M	JULES	There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
M	JULES	It's cold.
M	VINCENT	I think we oughta leave now.
M	JULES	That's probably a good idea.
