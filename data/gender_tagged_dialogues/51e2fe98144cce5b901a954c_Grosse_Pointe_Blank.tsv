M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MARTIN	Hooked it.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
M	CLUB MEMBER #2	He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
M	CLUB MEMBER #3	That's the way life is. The only meaning and value is what we create. Through structure, and discipline. Though they seem to limit our freedom, they actually give us great comfort. Your problem is you're looking for some great answer. Some ultimate truth. When what you really should do is go to work and go home.
M	CLUB MEMBER #2	And take golf lessons.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
M	CLUB MEMBER #2	A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
M	CLUB MEMBER #2	Insane.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	To make a long story short...
M	CLUB MEMBER #3	--Thank God--
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	...at last I found the holistic system of systems that opened up the doors of heaven for me right here on earth. And everyday I see the world through the eyes of a child. A world of creation and wonder.
M	CLUB MEMBER #2	Jesus...
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	Overflowing with love.
M	MARTIN	Tell me about it.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the secrets of your universe are divided up into eight easily digestible slices.
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	See, see. It's in the accessible and everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each day you have a little slice of peace...
M	MARTIN	Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony. You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
M	MARTIN	So you eat-- read it everyday?
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	Yes.
M	MARTIN	And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
M	CLUB MEMBER #1	Correct. That's for you. Keep it.
M	MARTIN AT CAR	He fishes out the laminated "Personal Pan Power" card, looks at it, and tosses it onto the ground. Police cars, now visible in the distance, wind into the long club driveway. Martin gets into his car and pulls away.
M	DRIVER	How was your day, today, sir?
M	MARTIN	Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
M	DRIVER	Do you like the people you work with?
M	MARTIN	I work alone.
M	DRIVER	That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
M	MARTIN	You understand the psychology of the job.
M	DRIVER	I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
M	DRIVER	You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
M	MARTIN	No.
M	DRIVER	Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
M	MARTIN	Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
M	DRIVER	It's only natural....
M	DRIVER	I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
M	MARTIN	Okay.
M	DRIVER	Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
M	DRIVER	I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
M	MARTIN	Up on the right.
M	DRIVER	And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
M	MARTIN	If it's not there, I can't proceed. Tell them.
M	MARTIN	Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. I'm only in town tonight.
M	MARTIN	What's different this time than the last time? I have to be down front...
M	MARTIN	...I don't bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me.
M	MARTIN	Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands full here.
M	MARTIN	Good. Account number 3649367, transfer to account number 96-546-38739-47825. Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's Mr. Duckman. If there are any problems, access file 673594638-IO- 98, and look at it.
M	MARTIN	Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the playoffs. That's why I'm offering a thousand dollars for one seat...
M	MARTIN	...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do I have to do to get courtside tickets for the Knicks...?
M	MARTIN	Never mind. I gotta go.
M	MARTIN	...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
F	MARCELLA	Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
M	MARTIN	Patch him through....
M	MARTIN	What do you want?
M	GROCER	I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
M	MARTIN	Like a union?
M	GROCER	Like a club. Work less, make more.
M	MARTIN	Thank you, no.
M	GROCER	We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
M	MARTIN	And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
M	GROCER	It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
M	MARTIN	Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
M	GROCER	I'm gonna get you, kid. "Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's been ten years? Where are you now...? ...Are you guiding an Outward Bound canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or perhaps in charge of appearances for the NFL like Leslie Gunther....? ...Could it be that you're like Chip Longfellow, at the trade-relations tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser owns a cheese shop...!
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	...Looking at yearbooks and pictures evokes so many memories...!
M	MARTIN (V.O.)	Fuck!
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	...Some good. Some bad. But all interesting...
M	MARTIN	Freeze! Police!
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	...As a graduate of the class of 1984, you are someone special...
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	...Whenever news of you filters back, the school is excited and proud of your accomplishments... ...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared you well to lead the kind of life that makes an impact on the world... ...Remember, "there's no where you can go that you haven't learned how to go in time... It's easy..."
M	HUSKY MAN	Whatever it is that I'm doing that you don't like I'll stop doing it.
M	MARTIN	It's not me.
F	MARCELLA	...So come on back to the old oak tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion committee."
M	MARTIN	Throw that away.
F	MARCELLA	This?
M	MARTIN	Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
F	MARCELLA	It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
M	MARTIN	Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
F	MARCELLA	All of it?
M	MARTIN	And not show it to me. Ever again.
F	MARCELLA	That's going to cost.
M	MARTIN	I'll pay.
F	MARCELLA	They're not happy, sir.
M	MARTIN	I'm not happy.
F	MARCELLA	They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
M	MARTIN	He didn't.
F	MARCELLA	They blame you for the compromise.
M	MARTIN	And they want me to make up for it.
F	MARCELLA	In Detroit. This weekend.
M	MARTIN	Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
F	MARCELLA	They were very upset.
M	MARTIN	Would you describe their position as inflexible?
F	MARCELLA	Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
F	MARCELLA	And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
M	MARTIN	There's nothing to be done about it.
F	MARCELLA	I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
M	MARTIN	Good. What else? Anything interesting?
F	MARCELLA	Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
F	MARCELLA	Enough?
M	MARTIN	Never enough.
F	MARCELLA	But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
M	MARTIN	I have scruples. Next.
F	MARCELLA	Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
F	MARCELLA	You should get going....
F	MARCELLA	Don't forget your identity.
M	MARTIN	See you next week.
M	MARTIN	Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way. Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
M	MARTIN	It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
F	DR. OATMAN	You went to school with these people.
M	MARTIN	Come on.
F	DR. OATMAN	We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
M	MARTIN	Shouldn't you be taking notes?
F	DR. OATMAN	Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
M	MARTIN	It'll be depressing.
F	DR. OATMAN	How do you know?
M	MARTIN	I just know.
F	DR. OATMAN	Say more.
M	MARTIN	They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
F	DR. OATMAN	You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
M	MARTIN	Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
F	DR. OATMAN	You know where I live?
M	MARTIN	We're both professionals, Oatman.
F	DR. OATMAN	I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens." So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
M	MARTIN	So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
F	DR. OATMAN	Yes.
M	MARTIN	Mmm.
F	DR. OATMAN	And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
M	MARTIN	Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me. The church seems to be purging itself of it's pedophile. It's a bull market.
M	MARTIN (V.O.)	Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
M	DR. OATMAN (V.O.)	Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
M	MARTIN	If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
F	DR. OATMAN	What stuff?
M	MARTIN	Morality.
F	DR. OATMAN	Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
M	MARTIN	If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
M	OATMAN	Now we're making progress.
M	CAT	Meow.
M	MARTIN	Just a minute.
M	CAT	Meow!
M	MARTIN	Food soon...
M	MARTIN	Tuna or liver?
M	CAT	Meow.
M	MARTIN	Tuna it is.
M	LARDNER	You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
M	MCCULLERS	Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
M	LARDNER	Lisbon?
M	MCCULLERS	In Portugal, yes.
M	LARDNER	Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
M	MCCULLERS	In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
M	LARDNER	You always say that. You always have to know everybody. Why don't I just take the weekend off and let you kill him. Since you two are so close.
M	BROADCAST (V.O.)	...with highs today in the upper seventies. Related stocks on Wall Street today as scandal continues to rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech Center... ...An unknown "whistle-blower" has leaked a number of critical flaws in the safety designs of next year's models to authorities that could cost millions in recalls....
M	MARTIN	Mein hero. --this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the time. Oldies from the eighties. It's a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--
M	FEMALE DEEJAY	--and I'm ready for some good tunes and angry talk. Or angry tunes and good talk-- --Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau Twins and get over the goo-angry- talking music. As you know-- --for some moments in life there are no words, and a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest man--
M	FEMALE DEEJAY	--The Cocteau Twins, though also a band of the nineties, will be aired due to the fact that they created their own language to sing by--
F	DEBI	--Now that's freedom--
F	DEBI	--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where are all the good men dead? In the heart or in the head? Back later....
M	MARTIN	What are you doing here?
M	CARL	A double shift. What's it look like? Can I help you with something?
M	MARTIN	I don't think so.
M	MARTIN	Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick up if you're there... It's Martin Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not here. My house is gone and now there's a 7-11 here... And that's unfortunate... You can never go home again, Dr. Oatman.
M	MARTIN	But I guess you can shop there.
M	NURSE	Mary, your son's here.
F	MARY	I bought a new rug.
M	MARTIN	That's wonderful, Mom.
F	MARY	What's a revival tent?
M	MARTIN	It's a place where religious people--
F	MARY	Marlin Perkins and Jim!
M	MARTIN	Jim?
F	MARY	His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
M	MARTIN	It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
F	MARY	I spoke to your father the other day.
M	MARTIN	I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
F	MARY	Nature made him then broke the mold.
M	MARTIN	They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
F	MARY	Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
M	MARTIN	You have a headache?
F	MARY	I have a headache. You have a headache?
M	MARTIN	No, I don't have one.
F	MARY	You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
F	MARY	We had a good laugh, didn't we?
M	MARTIN	Yeah. I guess we did.
F	MARY	Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
M	MARTIN	I think I'll go see Debi today.
F	MARY	Of course you will.
M	MARTIN	I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
F	MARY	Take care of her. She's a keeper.
M	MARTIN	Yeah...
F	MARY	And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
M	MARTIN	I have always thought about her and missed her.
F	MARY	Separate the wheat from the chaff and you've got the candle cat.
F	MARY	Remember no matter how impossible your problems feel. I've known people without a chance in the world. And all of a sudden, they have lives. Time allows miracles. Let yourself breathe, son.
M	MARTIN	Mom...
F	MARY	"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ Hey! Look out! You're gonna hurt someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ We really mean it!"
F	MARY	Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's your name?
M	MARTIN	Hey Pop... You got off easy. The house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho- pharmacological punching bag and I murder for cash. If you were here I think you'd be proud.
M	MARTIN	pries out a wall vent, slides in the case and replaces the vent.
M	MCCULLERS	"...Against the wind... just a young man running... Against the wind... let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on it the thuuunder! Night moves..."
F	DEBI	WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. Oldies from the eighties. That was ah... the Specials. Doing... one of their songs...
F	DEBI	...and here's another.
M	MARTIN	"Oldies from the eighties?"
F	DEBI	I just play my own collection.
M	MARTIN	It's nice to see you again.
M	MARTIN	How long has it been?
F	DEBI	Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
M	MARTIN	Ten years, I think. What I miss?
F	DEBI	Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
M	MARTIN	Here is now there. There is here.
F	DEBI	Those are the headlines.
F	DEBI	Hold that thought. WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, all the... No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.
F	DEBI	Tell me about yourself.
M	MARTIN	I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
F	DEBI	That's it?
M	MARTIN	Not much else.
F	DEBI	What's your business?
M	MARTIN	I'm a professional killer.
F	DEBI	Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
M	MARTIN	Well, I'm in town for a few days, anyway.
M	MARTIN	Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
F	DEBI	Okay.
F	DEBI	A man comes to you. He is from the past bringing you pain long since put behind you. He says peculiar things and leaves abruptly. It all comes flooding back...
F	DEBI	It felt like an apparition, or some cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time warp I'd been thrust back into without warning. There's a strangeness in the air and I don't mind telling you, I'm a little spooked. He was a man from my past. A man I loved. A man who disappeared.
F	DEBI	A man who's walking back into the station.
M	LARDNER	Well?
M	MCCULLERS	I don't think so.
M	LARDNER	Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
M	MCCULLERS	--Nooo--
M	LARDNER	--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
M	MCCULLERS	That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
M	LARDNER	It was the PLO.
M	MCCULLERS	Whatever.
F	DEBI	Sit.
F	DEBI	All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
M	MARTIN	Where have I been?
F	DEBI	More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
M	MARTIN	I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a
F	DEBI	--Torn down in the name of convenience--
M	MARTIN	--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
F	DEBI	Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
M	MARTIN	You see someone?
F	DEBI	Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
F	DEBI	All right then. Would you like to share any more deeply personal thoughts with our listening audience before we go to our phone poll and see how the folks in radioland come down on this one?
F	DEBI	Should a broken-hearted girl give a guy a second chance at love....
F	DEBI	You're on the air.
M	OLD WOMAN'S VOICE	I think this young man has avoided the question completely. Has not discussed "what happened" nor if he's sorry for what he has done. Therefore, I don't see any reason why you should see him until he fully discloses his intentions and feelings.
F	DEBI	Thank you caller.
F	DEBI	You're on the air.
M	DUMB GUY VOICE	Are you there?
F	DEBI	Yes.
M	DUMB GUY VOICE	No, the guy.
M	MARTIN	Yeah....
M	DUMB GUY VOICE	Uh... when you guys use to go out... Did you guys ever... heh heh heh heh... ever fuckin', ever totally fuckin' heh heh heh-
F	DEBI	Next caller.
M	GUFF MAN VOICE	I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad gas to me. I would not allow him access to your being.
F	DEBI	Thank you.
F	DEBI	Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you loud and clear: "If you love something set it free. If it comes back to you it's, well...
F	DEBI	...Broken...."
M	MARTIN	Dammit. Never trust my instincts.
M	PAUL	Hell, I would've voted for you, but there's all this apple sauce stuck in my phone... I don't wanna talk about it. How the hell are you?! Here's five good ones!
M	PAUL	Marty! It's me. Paul.
M	MARTIN	Paul?
M	PAUL	You're leaving me hanging here...
M	PAUL	Hey. Give me a break.
M	PAUL	This won't take but a minute. I just gotta hold their hands for a final walk-through. I'll take them in, get 'em out, then you and I can grab a little quality time.
M	PAUL	Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was afraid you joined a cult or something. I half-expected you to come back to town in a fennel wreath and paper pants.
M	MARTIN	There was no money in it.
M	MARTIN	So what happened to you?
M	PAUL	Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
M	MARTIN	Fair enough.
M	PAUL	God it's great to see you.
M	MARTIN	You too. Well, we do what we have to do if we find you on the property. But we don't really enforce the law, we execute company policy for homeowners.
M	MARTIN	So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
M	SOUTHTEC GUARD	Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
M	MARTIN	So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
M	SOUTHTEC GUARD	To shoot you. Correct.
M	MARTIN	How did you get this job?
M	SOUTHTEC GUARD	Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
M	MARTIN	Wow.
M	PAUL	...What more can I say.
M	HUSBAND	We'll talk soon.
M	PAUL	You'll be raising your new family in a work of art. A work of art in a work of art.
M	SOUTHTEC GUARD	I'm sure you'll be very happy.
M	MARTIN	When my time comes, if it ever does, I want a beautiful, normal place like this... and a wife like you...
M	MARTIN	...and you'll be safe here...
M	PAUL	Now. I don't make a habit of pimping my friends, but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see...
M	MARTIN (V.O.)	Debi's house.
M	PAUL (V.O.)	Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
M	MARTIN	No. You drove us here.
M	PAUL	Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
M	MARTIN	No.
M	PAUL	Ten years. What happened!?
M	MARTIN	I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
M	PAUL	Thank you.
M	PAUL	Professional killer, huh? Does that come with a good HMO?
M	MARTIN	He sells BMW's?
M	PAUL	He sold me this bad boy.
M	MARTIN	How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
M	PAUL	He gave me a great deal.
M	MARTIN	Mein Dealer.
M	PAUL	Hey! Bob! The car's running great.
M	BOB	Glad to hear it.
M	MARTIN	Bob...
M	BOB	What?
M	MARTIN	It's me. Martin Blank.
M	BOB	Really...? So what?
M	MARTIN	Okay. See you later.
M	PAUL	See you at the left-a-boy-came-back- a-man-made-good party.
M	CARL	Can I help you?
M	MARTIN	What's done is done.
M	SKATEBOARDER	What the fuck, man?!
M	MARTIN	Are you going to the reunion?
F	DEBI	No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
M	MARTIN	That's part of it.
F	DEBI	Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
M	MARTIN	It's always the little things.
F	DEBI	Yep.
M	MARTIN	I'm wondering how you've been. How you are. I'd like to catch up with you. If it's possible.
F	DEBI	Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
M	MARTIN	Well, there's not much to tell.
F	DEBI	I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
M	MARTIN	Bad experiences.
F	DEBI	You met people.
M	MARTIN	Bad people.
F	DEBI	Watched television?
M	MARTIN	Bad television.
F	DEBI	Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
M	MARTIN	What's that?
F	DEBI	It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
M	MARTIN	That'd be good.
F	DEBI	What do you want?
M	MARTIN	I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
F	DEBI	Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
M	MARTIN	Yes.
F	DEBI	Unbelievable.
M	MARTIN	Seven it is.
F	DEBI	I'll think about it.
M	MONTY	Baby, it's eight o'clock.
F	MARCELLA	Thanks, Monty.
F	MARCELLA	Hey there, how'd it go?
M	MARTIN	It isn't done.
F	MARCELLA	This is not good.
M	MARTIN	I'll do it tomorrow.
F	MARCELLA	What's it look like?
M	MARTIN	It's fine.
F	MARCELLA	You haven't looked at the dossier.
M	MARTIN	I've looked at it.
F	MARCELLA	You have.
M	MARTIN	Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
F	MARCELLA	I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
M	MARTIN	Tell them my house exploded.
F	MARCELLA	I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
M	MARTIN	Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
F	MARCELLA	Will do.
F	DEBI	Are you there?
M	MARTIN	Yes.
F	DEBI	Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
F	DEBI	Hello...?
M	MARTIN	This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
F	DEBI	You're fucking psycho.
M	MARTIN	Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
M	MCCULLERS	I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
M	LARDNER	We can't do our job unless he does his job.
M	MCCULLERS	Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
M	LARDNER	Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
M	MCCULLERS	Wait a minute--
M	LARDNER	-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
M	MCCULLERS	So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
M	LARDNER	Yup.
M	GROCER	moving into the diner.
M	GROCER	Easy, tiger.
M	WAITRESS	Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My name is Melanie and I'll be your server this morning. Let me tell you about some of our specials. Today we have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our feature omelette. And there's our "Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if you're in the mood for something different there's the "I left my heart in San Franchezie."
M	GROCER	I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
M	MARTIN	Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
M	WAITRESS	What would you like in the omelette?
M	MARTIN	Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at all.
M	GROCER	Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
M	MARTIN	No harm no foul.
M	GROCER	A little misunderstanding among my associates.
M	GROCER	I told them to kill you and they didn't.
M	MARTIN	Hard to get good help these days.
M	GROCER	But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
M	MARTIN	I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
M	MARTIN	Look, this is a one-on-one business... Every time you get to know people, bad things happen. If it'll make you feel any better, this is my last job. So what do you say we put our guns away and forget the whole damn thing.
M	GROCER	Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, everything's regulated!
M	MARTIN	No deal.
M	GROCER	Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
M	MARTIN	Is that right?
M	GROCER	Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
M	MARTIN	Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
M	MARTIN	Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell couch insurance. I test-market positive thinking. I lead a weekend men's group, actually. We specialize in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh. Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me? I'm not married, I have no kids and I'd blow your brains out if someone paid me enough... So how've you been? Where do you stand on The Issues? Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, shamed, blahblahblahblah--
F	DEBI	Flowers. That's funny.
M	MARTIN	As long as I get the laugh.
F	DEBI	Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
M	MARTIN	You look beautiful.
F	DEBI	Okay... Hold on... ...Let me get my coat.
M	MARTIN	I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
M	MARTIN	Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
M	MR. NEWBERRY	Good evening, Mr. Blank.
M	MARTIN	How are you? How's business?
M	MR. NEWBERRY	Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
M	MARTIN	How's that?
M	MR. NEWBERRY	I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
M	MARTIN	I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
M	MR. NEWBERRY	Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
M	MARTIN	Why not?
M	MR. NEWBERRY	So what are you doing with your life now, son?
M	MARTIN	I'm a professional killer.
M	MR. NEWBERRY	That's good.
M	DEBI (O.S.)	Okay
M	MARTIN	Do you want to get a drink first?
F	DEBI	I think they'll probably have booze there.
M	MARTIN	Right.
M	MARTIN	I'll just be a second.
F	DEBI	Okay...
M	MARTIN	...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but someone tried to kill me and the guy in the middle got killed. So if I see that guy again I'm definitely going to kill him, but I won't kill anyone else. Oh, except for the guy I was sent here to kill. I don't know...
F	DR. OATMAN	What else? Say more.
M	MARTIN	Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
F	DR. OATMAN	Okay. Repeat this after me.
M	MARTIN	Out Loud?
M	MARTIN	...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
F	DR. OATMAN	Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
M	MARTIN	This is me breating.
M	MARITN	Alright, look. I gotta go.
F	DR. OATMAN	And don't kill anyone.
M	MARTIN	Right. Don't kill anyone...
M	LARDNER	He's falling for her. Look at him.
M	MCCULLERS	He using her.
M	LARDNER	You're wrong. Look at his face.
M	MCCULLERS	One cannot love and kill.
M	LARDNER	I love. I kill.
M	MARTIN	Shoulda brought my gun.
F	DEBI	What?
F	ARLENE	Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
M	MARTIN	I'm Martin Blank.
F	DEBI	Debi Newberry.
F	ARLENE	Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
M	MARTIN	Don't say that.
F	ARLENE	We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
M	MARTIN	Wonderful.
F	ARLENE	So, what are you doing now?
M	MARTIN	Whatever I can get away with.
F	ARLENE	Isn't it cute. It's so everybody knows who everybody was!
M	BATENDER	What can I make you?
M	MARTIN	Beer.
M	MARTIN	Hey, Ken. How have you been?
M	KEN	Hello Martin. How have you been?
M	MARTIN	Not bad. You?
M	KEN	Hello, Bob.
M	MARTIN	Hey, Bob.
M	KEN	I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
M	MARTIN	That sounds pretty interesting...
M	KEN	Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
M	MARTIN	Those all seem kind of related...
M	MARTIN	Tragedy makes you thirsty.
M	MARTIN	Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
M	KEN	Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
M	MARTIN	Thanks.
M	TERRY	I don't know, Blank, all these fucking people, driving me crazy. Look at them over there, memorializing old times, acting all like it was something "life-changing." And the people in the National Honor Society? The name tags?
M	TERRY	They have special blue starts on them like it fucking matters now that they were in the honor club ten years ago. I'm getting fucking nauseous from all this sentimental bullshit. It's making me sick.
M	MARTIN	Why are you here... Terry?
M	TERRY	I wanted to see a couple people. But I don't want to talk about the old days... What did we have together, Martin? Typing?
M	MARTIN	Drafting.
M	TERRY	Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking class. But I appreciate you helping me out, man.
M	MARTIN	Don't mention it.
M	TERRY	Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try and get out of here, man. I'll see you later.
M	DAN	Bob. Bob Destephano.
M	BOB	What?
M	DAN	I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
M	BOB	Computer guy.
M	DAN	Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
M	BOB	I sell BMW's. What do you do?
M	DAN	Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
M	BOB	Remember high school?
M	DAN	Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
M	MIKE	...You gotta hold the fans responsible, though, Dennis, because they're the ones putting up with the mediocre product.
M	DENNIS	I guess, though, you know, if you look at it Mike, that park is a beautiful park, I've gone to that park many times - I've had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let's face it, I tell you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, if you're having the fun you should be having at Tigers Stadium, you don't even know what the hell's going on anyway...
M	DARIUS	Have you two been together since high school?
F	DEBI	No--
M	MARTIN	--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
F	DEBI	We haven't seen each other since high school.
M	DARIUS	I figured. You two look too happy together. I shouldn't say that though, I'm married... So, Martin-- what are you up to these days? What do you do for a living?
M	MARTIN	I'm in pro-active international relations. It's a very specialized company. We execute economic investment opportunities. Sort of economic clean-up... with an emphasis on personnel. It's boring, you know, it's boring. I don't like to talk about it because I don't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is...
M	MARTIN	...I've always tried to refrain from a black-and-white moral lexicon--you know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've been more interested in the gray areas.
M	MARTIN	But that's no way to live. I guess you've got to just take the leap of faith. Believe in something. Fuck it.
M	DARIUS	Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you happy?
M	MARTIN	I just have to close this one last account. I'd like to just stop now, today, but I can't... It's a step in the right direction.
F	DEBI	I don't know, Martin. It sounds like you're feeling compromised. Live the way you want. The only thing that's inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. That's the biggest cop-out there is.
F	AMY	But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
M	MARTIN	I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
F	AMY	You do not.
M	MARTIN	Yes I do.
F	AMY	You don't...
M	MARTIN	In the corporate offices.
F	AMY	Oh... really?
M	MARTIN	Yeah...
F	AMY	What do you do?
M	MARTIN	I sell biscuits to the Southland.
F	AMY	You do not.
M	MARTIN	It's what I do.
F	AMY	You're so funny...
M	MARTIN	I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
F	AMY	--Stop it--
M	MARTIN	You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
F	AMY	--No.
M	MARTIN	Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
M	DENNIS	What do you think about black coaching in the NFL, Darius? Because I think it's great.
M	DARIUS	I don't pay much attention to football.
M	MIKE	I have to agree with you Dennis. It's good to see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head coach or QB when for years in the league they've been kept out of the thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game.
M	DENNIS	But now, you see, you have Warren Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art Shell, and the coach up at Minnesota...
M	MIKE	Dennis Green. And if you remember, Doug Williams was the first black man to prove that on a Superbowl Sunday.
F	AMY	I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior High School.
M	DENNIS	...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand on this whole Louis Farrakhan issue...?
M	DARIUS	I'm a De Klerk man myself.
F	DEBI	I'm going over to play some tunes.
M	DAN	Look at her. There it is. Jenny Slater. The finest thing that ever walked these halls.
M	FORMER-SQUARE #2	I believe she married the state of Maine.
M	DAN	Yeah, he's around here somewhere. What a shame. She would have looked great in my fucking Bentley.
M	FORMER-SQUARE #3	No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only was she as fine, if not finer, than Slater, but she had the "bad girl" thing going for her. And the red hair. C'mon.
M	DAN	She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.
M	FORMER-SQUARE #2	You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti was the finest. No question about it.
M	FORMER-SQUARE #3	The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. All named Jenny...
M	DAN	You know what I'm really hoping? That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And she's twenty-eight--
M	FORMER-SQUARE #3	--she's got half the state of Maine--
M	DAN	She's twenty-eight years old, with two kids, she's still really really fine, and I see her at a bookstore or something, and she sees me for what I was then, and what I am now: the redemption for all her failure.
M	FORMER-SQUARE #3	You mean the redemption for all your failure.
F	DEBI	Which would you rather...?
M	MARTIN	Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
F	DEBI	Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
M	MARTIN	--She's not dead---
F	DEBI	It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
M	MARTIN	Wow. I have to give this some thought.
F	DEBI	No time.
M	MARTIN	Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
M	STACEY	Marty! Debi! How are you! So many people came, but I never expected to see you Marty. Or you Debi... I mean... because of what your divorce... I didn't mean to say that. I just meant you look so good.
F	DEBI	Thank you.
M	STACEY	Do you think you could play "Too Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?
F	DEBI	Stacey, why don't you come up here and take over for a little while?
M	STACEY	I'd love to.
F	DEBI	Everybody thinks they know me now that I'm divorced.
F	DEBI	It's time to see you in private.
M	MARTIN	Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
F	DEBI	Like heroin?
M	MARTIN	Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
F	DEBI	Like love?
M	MARTIN	Could be. The physical substance of love.
F	DEBI	I'll accept that. Follow me.
M	MCCULLERS	Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
M	LARDNER	If he does our job, he's our job.
M	MCCULLERS	I get it.
F	DEBI	I'll be right back....
M	BOB	So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
M	MARTIN	Fine, Bob. How are you?
M	BOB	Never better.
M	MARTIN	Really?
M	BOB	Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
M	MARTIN	You could've been a contender, huh?
M	BOB	Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how smart you are with my foot up your ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!
M	MARTIN	Why would you want to hit me, Bob? Do you really believe that there's some stored up conflict that needs resolution between us? We don't exist. There's nothing between us. So who do you want to hit, Bob? It's not me.
M	BOB	What am I gonna do?
M	MARTIN	What do you want to do?
M	BOB	I want to be an actor.
M	MARTIN	Then express yourself, Bob.
M	MARTIN	Be honest...
M	BOB	Later, Martin.
M	MARTIN	Have you seen Debi Newberry?
M	KEN	Nope.
M	KEN	The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
M	MARTIN	I guess.
M	MARTIN	Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks for the pen.
M	PAUL	What the hell happened to you?
M	MARTIN	I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
M	PAUL	As long as you had a good time.
M	PAUL	What now? Chase the girl?
M	MARTIN	It didn't work out.
M	PAUL	That's too bad.
M	MARTIN	I have to get my head back into my work.
M	PAUL	Work's good for the soul.
M	MARTIN	When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
M	PAUL	See you in ten years.
M	MARTIN	Dumb fucking luck...
F	DEBI	He was trying to kill you, right!
M	MARTIN	Yes.
F	DEBI	Not the other way around...?
M	MARTIN	No.
F	DEBI	Is it something you've done?
M	MARTIN	It's something I do...
M	MARTIN	...Professionally...
M	MARTIN	...About five years now.
F	DEBI	Get the fuck outta here.
M	MARTIN	Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
F	DEBI	You're a government spook?
M	MARTIN	I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
F	DEBI	Jesus Christ!
M	MARTIN	Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
F	DEBI	Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
M	MARTIN	Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
F	DEBI	Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
M	MARTIN	A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
F	DEBI	You never could have kept this from me.
M	MARTIN	I was leaving.
F	DEBI	That's probably a good idea.
M	MARTIN	Will you come with me?
F	DEBI	I'm staying here.
M	MARTIN	What if I come back?
F	DEBI	I'll hide.
M	MARTIN	Don't go.
F	DEBI	You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
M	MARTIN	You don't understand...
F	DEBI	That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
M	MARTIN	"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's up Doc, are you lookin'...?
F	MARCELLA	I'm bringing down the office now.
M	MARTIN	I'll put things right. Then I'll find you.
F	MARCELLA	Uh... why?
M	MARTIN	Don't worry. I left you a little something under your desk.
F	MARCELLA	All right!!
M	GROCER	Oh shit...
M	NEWBERRY	What the fuck is the matter with you?!
M	MARTIN	Well, I was hired to kill you. It's what I do, and come to think of it, I told you that, but... Okay. I'm not going to do it. Get in the car.
M	MARTIN	It's either because I'm in love with your daughter, or because I have a new-found respect for life. Or both. But I don't know.
M	GROCER	That punk is either in love with that guy's daughter or he has new found respect for life... Let's go.
M	NEWBERRY	Why? I build cars! They're paying you to kill me? Why?
M	MARTIN	It was a cost-cutting effort. They can't afford a recall.
M	NEWBERRY	It was a leaky sunroof! A design flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! You want to kill me because of that?
M	MARTIN	It's not me! Why does everybody think it's personal?!
M	LARDNER	We'll go in through the woods.
M	MARTIN	I was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that Goddamned rented tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other. So I was just sitting there, and then the whole night flashed before my eyes, and it struck me like a bullet in the head-- I realized, finally, and for the first time, that... I wanted to kill somebody. So I figured because I loved you so much, that'd it'd be a good idea if I didn't see you anymore. But now I'm different.
M	MARTIN	I'm in love with you. I know we can make this work!
M	MARTIN	I was afraid to commit to a relationship, but now I know I'm ready to make it happen.
M	MARTIN	I just need time to change.
M	MARTIN	It's not easy for me. I was raised to close off, to control my feelings...
M	MARTIN	Lock the door.
M	MARTIN	I wasn't raised in a loving environment. But that's not an excuse. It's a reason.
M	MARTIN	My soul was empty--
M	MARTIN	--and it's up to me to fill it.
M	MARTIN	It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
M	MARTIN	I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving. Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
M	GROCER (O.S.)	You're breaking my heart down here, Blank. I can't shoot through the tears.
M	LARDNER	Did you see Blank in there?
M	MCCULLERS	No...
M	LARDNER	Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
M	GROCER	...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
M	MARTIN	Okay.
M	MARTIN	There you go. I left it blank.
M	GROCER	Excellent. Here they come.
M	MARTIN (V.O.)	Debi... will you marry me?
F	DEBI	This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry cause that's what it does. Bringing you New Ones for the Nineties, a fresh new format designed to pull you out of what's come before, and reel you into what's coming soon--
F	DEBI	I tell you what's coming soon for me, or at least what I dreamed this morning in that weird time just before you actually wake up. But first this commercial. Back after this...
M	ANNOUNCER	Don't miss the show of the season at Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," starring Carol Plummer, Thomas Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee Ordman!...
F	DEBI	RFN...
F	DEBI	Hey out there... Okay... I'm going to finish up that fantasy later. First I'll give you an hour of nonstop music... If I don't come back on after that-- well, nevermind.
F	DEBI	This will never work out.
F	DEBI	You kill people.
M	MARTIN	I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
F	DEBI	Other people can't.
