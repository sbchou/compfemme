M	MAN2	All right. Let's get it!
M	MAN1	Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
M	MAN3	Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
M	SHREK	Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.
M	MEN	No!
M	SHREK	They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.
M	MAN1	Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!
M	SHREK	This is the part where you run away. And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and
M	GUARD	All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
M	HEAD GUARD	Next!
M	GUARD	Your flying days are over. (breaks the
M	HEAD GUARD	That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!
M	GUARD	Get up! Come on!
M	HEAD GUARD	Twenty pieces.
M	LITTLE BEAR	
M	DONKEY	Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!
M	OLD WOMAN	
M	DONKEY	Oh!
M	HEAD GUARD	Next! What have you got?
M	GIPETTO	This little wooden puppet.
M	PINOCCHIO	I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his
M	HEAD GUARD	Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.
M	PINOCCHIO	Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!
M	HEAD GUARD	Next! What have you got?
M	OLD WOMAN	Well, I've got a talking donkey.
M	HEAD GUARD	Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.
M	OLD WOMAN	Oh, go ahead, little fella.
M	HEAD GUARD	Well?
M	OLD WOMAN	Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
M	HEAD GUARD	That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
M	OLD WOMAN	No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.
M	HEAD GUARD	Get her out of my sight.
M	OLD WOMAN	No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!
M	DONKEY	Hey! I can fly!
M	PETER PAN	He can fly!
M	3 LITTLE PIGS	He can fly!
M	HEAD GUARD	He can talk!
M	DONKEY	Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink
M	HEAD GUARD	After him!
M	GUARDS	He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!
M	HEAD GUARD	You there. Ogre!
M	SHREK	Aye?
M	HEAD GUARD	By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.
M	SHREK	Oh, really? You and what army?
M	DONKEY	Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!
M	SHREK	and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!
M	DONKEY	Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.
M	SHREK	Oh, that's great. Really.
M	DONKEY	Man, it's good to be free.
M	SHREK	Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
M	DONKEY	But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
M	DONKEY	Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.
M	SHREK	Why are you following me?
M	DONKEY	I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith...
M	SHREK	Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.
M	DONKEY	Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.
M	SHREK	Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?
M	DONKEY	tall?
M	SHREK	No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you?
M	DONKEY	Nope.
M	SHREK	Really?
M	DONKEY	Really, really.
M	SHREK	Oh.
M	DONKEY	Man, I like you. What's you name?
M	SHREK	Uh, Shrek.
M	DONKEY	Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me Shrek. You all right. (They come over Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that?
M	SHREK	That would be my home.
M	DONKEY	Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?
M	SHREK	I like my privacy.
M	DONKEY	You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
M	SHREK	Uh, what?
M	DONKEY	Can I stay with you, please?
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Really?
M	SHREK	No.
M	DONKEY	Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
M	SHREK	Okay! Okay! But one night only.
M	DONKEY	
M	SHREK	What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No!
M	DONKEY	This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
M	SHREK	Oh!
M	DONKEY	Where do, uh, I sleep?
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...
M	SHREK	stay outside.
M	DONKEY	(from the window) I am outside.
M	BLIND MOUSE1	Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
M	BLIND MOUSE2	It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
M	GORDO	
M	SHREK	Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes
M	GORDO	I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's
M	SHREK	Ow!
M	GORDO	Blah! Awful stuff.
M	BLIND MOUSE1	Is that you, Gordo?
M	GORDO	How did you know?
M	SHREK	Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.
M	SHREK	Huh?
M	BIG BAD WOLF	What?
M	SHREK	I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No!
M	SHREK	What are you doing in my swamp? (this
M	SHREK	All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to
M	DONKEY	Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.
M	PINOCCHIO	Oh, gosh, no one invited us.
M	SHREK	What?
M	PINOCCHIO	We were forced to come here.
M	SHREK	
M	LITTLE PIG	Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice.
M	SHREK	this Farquaad guy is?
M	DONKEY	Oh, I do. I know where he is.
M	SHREK	Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?
M	DONKEY	Me! Me!
M	SHREK	Anyone?
M	DONKEY	Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!
M	SHREK	(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me.
M	DONKEY	All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!
M	DONKEY	with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again.
M	SHREK	What did I say about singing?
M	DONKEY	Can I whistle?
M	SHREK	No.
M	DONKEY	Can I hum it?
M	SHREK	All right, hum it.
M	FARQUAAD	That's enough. He's ready to talk.
M	FARQUAAD	and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man.
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	You are a monster.
M	FARQUAAD	I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others?
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's
M	FARQUAAD	I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.
M	FARQUAAD	All right then. Who's hiding them?
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?
M	FARQUAAD	The muffin man?
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	The muffin man.
M	FARQUAAD	Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	Well, she's married to the muffin man.
M	FARQUAAD	The muffin man?
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	The muffin man!
M	FARQUAAD	She's married to the muffin man.
M	HEAD GUARD	My lord! We found it.
M	FARQUAAD	Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	
M	FARQUAAD	Magic mirror...
M	GINGERBREAD MAN	Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No!
M	FARQUAAD	Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?
M	MIRROR	Well, technically you're not a king.
M	FARQUAAD	hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying?
M	MIRROR	What I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.
M	FARQUAAD	Go on.
M	MIRROR	and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?
M	GUARDS	Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!
M	FARQUAAD	Three? One? Three?
M	THELONIUS	Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord!
M	FARQUAAD	Okay, okay, uh, number three!
M	MIRROR	Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
M	FARQUAAD	Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go...
M	MIRROR	But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
M	FARQUAAD	I'll do it.
M	MIRROR	Yes, but after sunset...
M	FARQUAAD	Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)
M	DONKEY	But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
M	SHREK	So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
M	DONKEY	Uh-huh. That's the place.
M	SHREK	Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking
M	DONKEY	Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.
M	MAN	Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
M	SHREK	Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then
M	SHREK	It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
M	DONKEY	Hey, look at this!
M	WOODEN PEOPLE	Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
M	DONKEY	Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready
M	SHREK	No. No. No, no, no! No.
M	FARQUAAD	Brave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...
M	SHREK	All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.
M	DONKEY	Sorry about that.
M	FARQUAAD	That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous!
M	SHREK	at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.
M	FARQUAAD	Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him!
M	MEN	Get him!
M	SHREK	Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of
M	CROWD	Go ahead! Get him!
M	SHREK	settle this over a pint?
M	CROWD	Kill the beast!
M	SHREK	Come on!
M	DONKEY	Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!
M	SHREK	Yeah!
F	WOMAN	The chair! Give him the chair!
M	SHREK	Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
M	HEAD GUARD	Shall I give the order, sir?
M	FARQUAAD	No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!
M	SHREK	What?
M	FARQUAAD	Congratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
M	SHREK	Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.
M	FARQUAAD	Your swamp?
M	SHREK	Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!
M	FARQUAAD	Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.
M	SHREK	Exactly the way it was?
M	FARQUAAD	Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
M	SHREK	And the squatters?
M	FARQUAAD	As good as gone.
M	SHREK	What kind of quest?
M	DONKEY	Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
M	SHREK	You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.
M	DONKEY	I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.
M	SHREK	Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?
M	DONKEY	Uh, no, not really, no.
M	SHREK	For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.
M	DONKEY	Example?
M	SHREK	Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
M	DONKEY	
M	SHREK	Yes - - No!
M	DONKEY	They make you cry?
M	SHREK	No!
M	DONKEY	You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.
M	SHREK	No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he heaves
M	DONKEY	have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
M	SHREK	I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes.
M	DONKEY	You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.
M	SHREK	No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
M	DONKEY	Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
M	SHREK	You know, I think I preferred your humming.
M	DONKEY	Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.
M	DONKEY	(sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything.
M	SHREK	Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close.
M	DONKEY	Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither.
M	SHREK	Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs...then the laugh turns
M	DONKEY	Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?
M	SHREK	Oh, aye.
M	DONKEY	Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.
M	SHREK	Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
M	DONKEY	You know what I mean.
M	SHREK	You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
M	DONKEY	No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!
M	SHREK	Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.
M	DONKEY	Really?
M	SHREK	Really, really.
M	DONKEY	Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
M	SHREK	Just keep moving. And don't look down.
M	DONKEY	Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!
M	SHREK	But you're already halfway.
M	DONKEY	But I know that half is safe!
M	SHREK	Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.
M	DONKEY	Shrek, no! Wait!
M	SHREK	Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the
M	DONKEY	Don't do that!
M	SHREK	Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces
M	DONKEY	Yes, that!
M	SHREK	Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across
M	DONKEY	No, Shrek! No! Stop it!
M	SHREK	You said do it! I'm doin' it.
M	DONKEY	I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh!
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?
M	SHREK	Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.
M	DONKEY	I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
M	DONKEY	You afraid?
M	SHREK	No.
M	DONKEY	But...
M	SHREK	Shh.
M	DONKEY	Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.
M	SHREK	Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
M	DONKEY	Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.
M	SHREK	be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
M	DONKEY	What makes you think she'll be there?
M	SHREK	I read it in a book once. (walks off)
M	DONKEY	Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.
M	DONKEY	I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.
M	SHREK	Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...
M	DONKEY	(os) Dragon!
M	SHREK	a hold of the dragons tail and holds on) Got ya!
M	DONKEY	Oh! Aah! Aah!
M	DONKEY	No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, what large teeth you have. (the dragon growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. at him) What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
F	FIONA	Oh! Oh!
M	SHREK	Wake up!
F	FIONA	What?
M	SHREK	Are you Princess Fiona?
F	FIONA	I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
M	SHREK	Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!
F	FIONA	But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?
M	SHREK	Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
F	FIONA	Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
M	SHREK	You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?
F	FIONA	(smiles) Mm-hmm.
F	FIONA	But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
M	SHREK	I don't think so.
F	FIONA	Can I at least know the name of my champion?
M	SHREK	Uh, Shrek.
F	FIONA	Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
M	SHREK	Thanks!
F	FIONA	
M	SHREK	It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
F	FIONA	But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.
M	SHREK	Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
F	FIONA	That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek ignores her and heads for a wooden door off to the side.) Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.
M	SHREK	Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you?
M	SHREK	One of a kind. (opens the door into
M	DONKEY	I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room) I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!
M	DONKEY	Hi, Princess!
F	FIONA	It talks!
M	SHREK	Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.
M	SHREK	Oh!
M	SHREK	Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.
M	SHREK	(echoing) Run!
F	FIONA	did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. You're... hill and bump into Donkey) a little unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears his throat.) And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?
M	DONKEY	I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
F	FIONA	The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.
M	SHREK	Uh, no.
F	FIONA	Why not?
M	SHREK	I have helmet hair.
F	FIONA	Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.
M	SHREK	No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.
F	FIONA	But how will you kiss me?
M	SHREK	What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description.
M	DONKEY	Maybe it's a perk.
F	FIONA	No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
M	DONKEY	Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love?
F	FIONA	Well, yes.
M	DONKEY	You think Shrek is your true love!
F	FIONA	What is so funny?
M	SHREK	Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet.
M	SHREK	Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
F	FIONA	Just take off the helmet.
M	SHREK	I'm not going to.
F	FIONA	Take it off.
M	SHREK	No!
F	FIONA	Now!
M	SHREK	Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.
F	FIONA	You- - You're a- - an ogre.
M	SHREK	Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
F	FIONA	Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre.
M	SHREK	Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you.
F	FIONA	Then why didn't he come rescue me?
M	SHREK	Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.
F	FIONA	But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet.
M	DONKEY	Well, so much for noble steed.
M	SHREK	You're not making my job any easier.
F	FIONA	I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.
M	SHREK	Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. her over his shoulder like she was a
F	FIONA	You wouldn't dare. Put me down!
M	SHREK	Ya comin', Donkey?
M	DONKEY	I'm right behind ya.
F	FIONA	Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!
M	DONKEY	Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?
F	FIONA	You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your...(Shrek drops her on the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
M	DONKEY	You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!
F	FIONA	And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?
M	SHREK	Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
M	DONKEY	I don't know. There are those who think little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
M	SHREK	Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.
F	FIONA	It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
M	SHREK	No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.
F	FIONA	But there's robbers in the woods.
M	DONKEY	Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting to sound good.
M	SHREK	Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.
F	FIONA	I need to find somewhere to camp now!
M	SHREK	Hey! Over here.
M	DONKEY	Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.
F	FIONA	No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.
M	SHREK	Homey touches? Like what? (he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona
F	FIONA	A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. (goes into the cave and
M	DONKEY	You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.
F	FIONA	(os) I said good night!
M	DONKEY	Shrek, What are you doing?
M	SHREK	(laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.
M	SHREK	And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.
M	DONKEY	Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?
M	SHREK	The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.
M	DONKEY	I know you're making this up.
M	SHREK	No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.
M	DONKEY	That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
M	SHREK	You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
M	DONKEY	we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
M	SHREK	Our swamp?
M	DONKEY	You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
M	SHREK	We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.
M	DONKEY	You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
M	SHREK	No, do ya think?
M	DONKEY	Are you hidin' something?
M	SHREK	Never mind, Donkey.
M	DONKEY	Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
M	SHREK	No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.
M	DONKEY	Why don't you want to talk about it?
M	SHREK	Why do you want to talk about it?
M	DONKEY	Why are you blocking?
M	SHREK	I'm not blocking.
M	DONKEY	Oh, yes, you are.
M	SHREK	Donkey, I'm warning you.
M	DONKEY	Who you trying to keep out?
M	SHREK	Everyone! Okay?
M	DONKEY	
M	SHREK	Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff
M	DONKEY	What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?
M	SHREK	Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.
M	DONKEY	You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.
M	SHREK	Yeah, I know.
M	DONKEY	So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
M	SHREK	Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.
M	DONKEY	Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?
M	SHREK	That's the moon.
M	DONKEY	Oh, okay.
M	FARQUAAD	Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.
M	MIRROR	Hmph.
M	FARQUAAD	Ah. Perfect.
M	DONKEY	(quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it.
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Huh? What?
M	SHREK	Wake up.
M	DONKEY	What? (stretches and yawns)
F	FIONA	Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?
M	DONKEY	Oh, good morning, Princess!
M	SHREK	What's all this about?
F	FIONA	You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
M	SHREK	Uh, thanks.
F	FIONA	Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. (walks off)
M	DONKEY	Shrek!
M	SHREK	What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs)
M	DONKEY	Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.
F	FIONA	Thanks.
M	DONKEY	She's as nasty as you are.
M	SHREK	(chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what I expected.
F	FIONA	Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.
M	ROBIN HOOD	La liberte! Hey!
M	SHREK	Princess!
F	FIONA	
M	ROBIN HOOD	Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses up her arm while Fiona pulls back in disgust)...beast.
M	SHREK	Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own!
M	ROBIN HOOD	Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?
F	FIONA	know who you think you are!
M	ROBIN HOOD	Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.
M	MERRY MEN	Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.
M	ROBIN HOOD	I steal from the rich and give to the needy.
M	MERRY MEN	He takes a wee percentage,
M	ROBIN HOOD	But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good.
M	MERRY MEN	What a guy, Monsieur Hood.
M	ROBIN HOOD	Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid...
M	MERRY MEN	What he's basically saying is he likes to get...
M	ROBIN HOOD	Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
M	MERRY MEN	That's bad.
M	ROBIN HOOD	When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad.
M	MERRY MEN	He's mad, he's really, really mad.
M	ROBIN HOOD	I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start...
F	FIONA	Man, that was annoying!
M	MERRY MAN	
F	FIONA	Uh, shall we?
M	SHREK	Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?
F	FIONA	What?
M	SHREK	That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?
F	FIONA	uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a...(gasps and points) there's an arrow in your butt!
M	SHREK	What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you
F	FIONA	Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
M	DONKEY	
F	FIONA	Shrek's hurt.
M	DONKEY	Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
M	SHREK	Donkey, I'm okay.
M	DONKEY	You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich?
F	FIONA	Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
M	DONKEY	Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!
M	SHREK & FIONA	Donkey!
M	DONKEY	Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.
M	SHREK	What are the flowers for?
F	FIONA	of Donkey.
M	SHREK	Ah.
F	FIONA	Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little
M	SHREK	yankin'.
F	FIONA	I'm sorry, but it has to come out. No, it's tender.
F	FIONA	Now, hold on.
M	SHREK	What you're doing is the opposite of help.
F	FIONA	Don't move.
M	SHREK	Look, time out.
F	FIONA	Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his hand over her face to stop her from getting at the arrow) Okay. What do you propose we do?
M	DONKEY	Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens
M	SHREK	Ow! Not good.
F	FIONA	Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just about...
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Ahem.
M	SHREK	happend. We were just, uh - -
M	DONKEY	Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?
M	SHREK	Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow!
M	DONKEY	That's...is that blood?
M	SHREK	There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.
F	FIONA	That's DuLoc?
M	DONKEY	Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really...(Shrek steps on his hoof) Ow!
M	SHREK	Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move on.
F	FIONA	Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.
M	SHREK	What?
F	FIONA	I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.
M	DONKEY	What are you talking about? I'm fine.
F	FIONA	what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back. (pause) Dead.
M	SHREK	You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?
F	FIONA	Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.
M	DONKEY	I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, (turns his neck in a very sharp way until his head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
M	SHREK	Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
F	FIONA	I'll get the firewood.
M	DONKEY	Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug.
F	FIONA	Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?
M	SHREK	Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.
F	FIONA	No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
M	SHREK	Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew. (chuckles)
F	FIONA	I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.
M	SHREK	Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.
F	FIONA	(smiles) I'd like that.
M	SHREK	Um, Princess?
F	FIONA	Yes, Shrek?
M	SHREK	Are you gonna eat that?
M	DONKEY	Just look at that sunset.
F	FIONA	(jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.
M	SHREK	What?
M	DONKEY	Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
F	FIONA	Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.
M	DONKEY	Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.
F	FIONA	Good night.
M	SHREK	Good night.
M	DONKEY	Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.
M	SHREK	Oh, what are you talkin' about?
M	DONKEY	I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.
M	SHREK	You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.
M	DONKEY	Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel.
M	SHREK	I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm
M	DONKEY	An ogre?
M	SHREK	Yeah. An ogre.
M	DONKEY	Hey, where you goin'?
M	SHREK	To get... move firewood. (sighs)
M	DONKEY	Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess?
M	DONKEY	It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.
M	DONKEY	Aah!
F	FIONA	Oh, no!
M	DONKEY	No, help!
F	FIONA	Shh!
M	DONKEY	Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
F	FIONA	No, it's okay. It's okay.
M	DONKEY	What did you do with the princess?
F	FIONA	Donkey, I'm the princess.
M	DONKEY	Aah!
F	FIONA	It's me, in this body.
M	DONKEY	Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me?
F	FIONA	Donkey!
M	DONKEY	keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!
F	FIONA	No!
M	DONKEY	Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
F	FIONA	Shh.
M	DONKEY	Shrek!
F	FIONA	This is me.
M	DONKEY	Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.
F	FIONA	I'm ugly, okay?
M	DONKEY	Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - -
F	FIONA	No. I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.
M	DONKEY	What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.
F	FIONA	It only happens when sun goes down. "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."
M	DONKEY	Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
F	FIONA	It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. (begins
M	DONKEY	All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.
F	FIONA	But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.
M	DONKEY	Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?
F	FIONA	I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.
M	DONKEY	But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a lot in common.
F	FIONA	Shrek?
M	SHREK	it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.
F	FIONA	(os) I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.
F	FIONA	ever after is to marry my true love.
F	FIONA	Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.
M	DONKEY	You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
F	FIONA	No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.
M	DONKEY	What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
F	FIONA	Promise you won't tell. Promise!
M	DONKEY	All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. (goes outside) I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.
F	FIONA	I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want...(she looks and sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky she turns back
F	FIONA	Shrek. Are you all right?
M	SHREK	Perfect! Never been better.
F	FIONA	I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.
M	SHREK	You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night.
F	FIONA	You heard what I said?
M	SHREK	Every word.
F	FIONA	I thought you'd understand.
M	SHREK	Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
F	FIONA	But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
M	SHREK	Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at him in shock. He looks past her and spots a group approaching.) Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something.
M	DONKEY	What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey.
M	FARQUAAD	Princess Fiona.
M	SHREK	As promised. Now hand it over.
M	FARQUAAD	Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.
F	FIONA	Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... (Watches as Farquaad is lifted off his horse and set down in front of her. He comes to her waist.) farewell.
M	FARQUAAD	Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings.
F	FIONA	No, you're right. It doesn't.
M	FARQUAAD	Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
F	FIONA	Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - -
M	FARQUAAD	the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
F	FIONA	No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets.
M	FARQUAAD	Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona
F	FIONA	Fare-thee-well, ogre.
M	DONKEY	Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.
M	SHREK	Yeah? So what?
M	DONKEY	Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -
M	SHREK	I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?
M	DONKEY	Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.
M	SHREK	I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
M	DONKEY	But I thought - -
M	SHREK	Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!
M	DONKEY	Shrek.
M	SHREK	Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues with what he's doing.) What are you doing?
M	DONKEY	I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.
M	SHREK	Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.
M	DONKEY	It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.
M	SHREK	Oh! Your half. Hmm.
M	DONKEY	Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.
M	SHREK	Back off!
M	DONKEY	No, you back off.
M	SHREK	This is my swamp!
M	DONKEY	Our swamp.
M	SHREK	with) Let go, Donkey!
M	DONKEY	You let go.
M	SHREK	Stubborn jackass!
M	DONKEY	Smelly ogre.
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.
M	SHREK	Well, I'm through with you.
M	DONKEY	Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
M	SHREK	Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
M	DONKEY	Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
M	SHREK	Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back!
M	DONKEY	Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.
M	SHREK	
M	DONKEY	There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.
M	SHREK	(os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking.
M	DONKEY	She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
M	SHREK	(opens the door and comes out) She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?
M	DONKEY	Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?
M	SHREK	Donkey!
M	DONKEY	No!
M	SHREK	I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
M	DONKEY	Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
M	SHREK	Right. Friends?
M	DONKEY	Friends.
M	SHREK	So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
M	DONKEY	What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?
M	SHREK	The wedding! We'll never make it in time.
M	DONKEY	Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way.
M	SHREK	Donkey?
M	DONKEY	I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
M	SHREK	Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a
M	DONKEY	All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet.
M	PRIEST	People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witness to the union....
F	FIONA	
M	PRIEST	...of our new king...
F	FIONA	Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?
M	FARQUAAD	to indulge Fiona) Go on.
M	DONKEY	If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? (she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?
M	SHREK	about?
M	DONKEY	There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"
M	SHREK	I don't have time for this!
M	DONKEY	Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?
M	SHREK	Yes.
M	DONKEY	You wanna hold her?
M	SHREK	Yes.
M	DONKEY	Please her?
M	SHREK	Yes!
M	DONKEY	got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap!

M	SHREK	of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first of all. Very clean.
F	FIONA	What are you doing here?
M	SHREK	Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding...
M	SHREK	Fiona! I need to talk to you.
F	FIONA	Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me
M	SHREK	But you can't marry him.
F	FIONA	And why not?
M	SHREK	Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.
M	FARQUAAD	Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
M	SHREK	He's not your true love.
F	FIONA	And what do you know about true love?
M	SHREK	Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

M	FARQUAAD	An ogre and a princess!
F	FIONA	Shrek, is this true?
M	FARQUAAD	Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me!
F	FIONA	one way, by day another." (to Shrek) I wanted to show you before.

F	FIONA	No, let go of me! Shrek!
M	SHREK	No!
M	FARQUAAD	Don't just stand there, you morons.
M	SHREK	Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!
M	FARQUAAD	I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!
F	FIONA	No, Shrek!
M	FARQUAAD	as for you, my wife...
M	SHREK	Fiona!
M	FARQUAAD	I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I'm king!

M	DONKEY	All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on the edge!
M	DONKEY	Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

M	CONGREGATION	Aawww!
M	WHISPERS	"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form. Take love's true form. Take love's true form."
M	SHREK	you all right?
F	FIONA	yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.
M	SHREK	But you ARE beautiful.
