M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	COSTELLO (V.O.)	I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product...of me.
M	COSTELLO (V.O.)	Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city.
M	COSTELLO (V.O.)	Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a job, we had the presidency. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chaps it's this. No one gives it to you. You have to take it.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	Don't make me have to come down here again. CONTINUED:
M	PROPRIETOR	Won't happen again, Mr. C.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	Carmen's developing into a fine young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen?
M	YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)	You Johnny Sullivan's kid?
M	YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)	You live with your grandmother?
M	YOUNG COLIN	Yeah.
M	COSTELLO	Get him three loaves of bread. And a couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup. Do you like comic books?
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	You do good in school?
M	COLIN	Yes.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	That's good. I did good in school. They call that a paradox.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the change.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)	You ever want to earn a little extra money, you come by L street. You know where I am on L street.
M	YOUNG COLIN	Thank you. CONTINUED: To you, O Lord we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your Servant; in the sight of this world he is now dead; in your sight may he live forever. Forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness and in your goodness grant him everlasting peace.
M	ALL	Amen.
M	PRIEST (VO)	May the angels lead you into paradise; May the martyrs come to welcome you and take you to the holy city, The new and eternal Jerusalem.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	Church wants you in your place. What sort of man wants to be kept in his place? Do this don't do that, kneel, stand, kneel, stand...I mean if you go for that sort of thing... I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. Non serviam.
M	YOUNG COLIN	James Joyce. CONTINUED:
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	Him and Lucifer. And me. Guineas from the North End and down Providence, tried to tell me what to do...And something maybe happened to them.
M	COSTELLO	Jeez, she fell funny.
F	FRENCH	Frank, you gotta see somebody.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO	You decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you, the Church.
M	YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)	When I was your age, they would say, we become cops or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: When you are facing a loaded gun...
M	YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)	What's the difference? THE SAME EYES.
M	INSTRUCTOR	The slug enters the skull by forming a small entrance hole. Blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from this hole. The bullet, which may expand, fragment or tumble, then passes through the brain...
M	COLIN	Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire. Or pussy. CONTINUED:
M	BARRIGAN	What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, and his son's only a cop.
M	COLIN	You're in trouble if you're "only" anything.
M	BARRIGAN	Don't tell me I'm looking at the first dickhead-American president of the United States.
M	SPEAKER (V.O.)	The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation. As the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity.
M	THE MAYOR VO	Congratulations. You are dismissed. CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	School's out. You earned it. Yeah, no more teachers, no more books.
M	INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)	Begin.
M	BROWN	She tells me, you never finish anything. You finish the police course you get taken care of again baby. So after graduation I get a blowjob again.
F	BILLY	That's great. Your mom must be a wonderful woman.
M	BROWN	Fuck yourself. CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked.
M	BROWN	Ways to get ahead, though, man, ways to get ahead.
F	BILLY	To where. (Yeah)
M	DRILL INSTRUCTOR	This is not the regular police. This is the state police. Your training will illustrate the difference. What's the difference?
F	BILLY	Rage issues and lower median IQ.
M	DRILL INSTRUCTOR	You say something?
F	BILLY	Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir.
M	DRILL INSTRUCTOR	We're not superior, we're the best.
F	BILLY	Sir, yes sir.
M	COLIN	Douchebag!
F	QUEENAN	Congratulations on passing the detective exam, and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit.
M	DIGNAM	Whoop-di fuckin' do.
F	QUEENAN	We won't be working directly together, you'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. You're a worker, you rise fast. CONTINUED:
M	DIGNAM	Like a twelve year old's dick.
M	COLIN	Thank you, Sergeant.
M	DIGNAM	My pleasure.
M	COLIN	Thank you, sir.
M	QUEENAN'S SECRETARY	Congratulations.
M	COLIN	Thanks, hon.
M	QUEENAN'S SECRETARY	You can go in there now.
F	QUEENAN	You can sit. CONTINUED: So. Do you know what we do here? My section?
F	BILLY	Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Whoa, let's say you have no idea and leave it there. No idea. Zip, none. If you had an idea about what we do we would not be good at what we do. We would be cunts. Are you calling us cunts?
F	QUEENAN	Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own. I'm afraid we all have to deal with it.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	You have family connections down in Southie. Through your father. Tell us about your uncle Jackie.
F	BILLY	Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville. He got popped by Nicastro in '95. They found his body out by the airport.
F	BILLY	That's right. I remember his funeral.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Closed casket?
F	BILLY	That's right.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	You tell anybody at Deerfield - that is, before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair - you had an uncle met his demise like that?
M	SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D)	I got a question. How fucked up are you?
M	BARRIGAN	What you got? "Staff Sergeant". In four years you're a sergeant.
M	COLIN	SIU. What a country.
M	BARRIGAN	Perfect. CONTINUED: Meaning to some extent "Perfect for a dick like you". This is
M	COLIN	I don't mind going it alone. If you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself.
M	BARRIGAN	We're cops. This isn't "somewhere".
M	COLIN	I know you're a worker. I might be able to do something for you. You got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you're gonna invade Poland.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Let's look at the rest of the family tree. Your maggot uncle Tommy Costigan--he's another goof-- got busted selling guns to federal officers. Among many, many, many other departures from, ah, "normative behavior".
F	BILLY	What's this got to do with me?
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Why are you pretending to be a cop?
M	ELLERBY	This unit is new, and you are the newest members of it. You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude. CONTINUED: This is an elite unit. Our job is to smash--or at least marginally disrupt-- --organized crime in this city by our own efforts and by enhanced cooperation with the FBI, represented here by Agent Frank Lazio-- and we will do it. And by organized crime in this city...you know who we mean.
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	That's Jackie Costigan...that's an old picture. Jackie met his demise.
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	Last known photograph.
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	Costello uses three key guys. There's Fitzy...off the boat psycho...lives in Brockton with his mother who looks like she's straight out of "Going My Way"... There's Delahunt, muscle, and here's French...the number one. But of course the rock star is...[you know who]
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	We've done a briefing book. Read up. I want to have any and all ideas, so I can pass them off as my own. Do your jobs and you will rise fast. You're in the best position in the department. Let's go to work.
M	DIGNAM	Your old man was a hump from Southie. Baggage-handler at the airport. Family's all criminals except your old man.
F	BILLY	And one priest. Since you seem to know everything.
M	DIGNAM	I ain't sure about him, either. married to a 12 year old boy and Family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Lifers down there. Three decker men at best. You grew up, however, up the North shore. La di (fuckin') da.
M	DIGNAM (CONT'D)	You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man. One kid with your mother. Upper middle class in the week, and then dropping your 'r's and hanging in the Southie projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends. I got that right? CONTINUED:
M	SGT. DIGNAM	You have different accents? You did, didn't you. (You little fuckin' snake.) You were different fuckin' people.
F	BILLY	You a psychiatrist?
M	SGT. DIGNAM	If I was I'd ask you why you're a Statie making thirty grand a year. And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I wouldn't get an answer. So tell me, what's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties?
F	BILLY	Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right?
F	QUEENAN	Who said that?
F	BILLY	Hawthorne.
M	DIGNAM	What's the matter, smartass? You don't know any fuckin' Shakespeare?
F	QUEENAN	We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV...
M	SGT. DIGNAM	A lot of em just want to slam a nigger's head through a plate glass window.
F	BILLY	I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant.
M	DIGNAM	What the fuck did you say to me, trainee?
F	BILLY	Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me?
M	DIGNAM	Hey asshole, he can't help you. I know what you are, and what you aren't. I'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth. I'm gonna help you understand something: You're no fuckin' cop.
F	QUEENAN	He's right. We deal in deceptions here. But what we don't deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State trooper.
F	BILLY	You sure of that?
F	QUEENAN	I'm sure of that.
M	DIGNAM	Guaranteed.
F	QUEENAN	You don't have much family.
F	BILLY	I don't have any family.
M	WASP UNCLE	What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?
F	BILLY	You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie?
M	UNCLE	That Stephanie.
F	BILLY	Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.
M	UNCLE	Are you trying to prove something to the family?
F	BILLY	When you say "family", what do you mean? You? CONTINUED:
M	UNCLE	You always question everything, don't you?
F	BILLY	Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. "Am I an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?" "Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?" Those are questions. "Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?" Too late now, right?
M	UNCLE	Do you need some money for the funeral?
F	BILLY	When my mother dies we don't have any connection. You got it?
M	REALTOR	This is it. Nice. You've got high ceilings, parquet floors. There's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues.... Joke...not a very good one. So, you're a policeman? CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	I'm a State Police detective.
M	REALTOR	State Police Detective. You a married State Police Detective?
M	COLIN	...No.
M	REALTOR	Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if a cop...
M	COLIN	I have a cosigner.
M	REALTOR	You intend to have a housemate. That's cool.
M	COLIN	Give me the fuckin' papers.
F	BILLY	So what do I do?
F	QUEENAN	During the war, Churchill used river mines. He'd float them down the rivers into Germany. They'd either hit something, or not. That's what we'll use you for. I'll float you down the river. The rest will happen. Or it won't... CONTINUED: By the way, this isn't police work for peanuts. There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a cop, but there is a bonus involved. Tax free.
M	DIGNAM	Luck of the Irish. All that and you're still young enough to fuck undergraduates.
F	QUEENAN	We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense.
M	DIGNAM	Given your nature.
F	QUEENAN	You'll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that it's no set- up. You'll be on probation. The whole nine yards.
M	DIGNAM	I need you, pal. You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.
F	BILLY	Every weekend...Sergeant.
M	DIGNAM	Perfect.
F	QUEENAN	Do it again. For me.
M	OTHER PRISONER	You're Bill Costigan?
F	BILLY	Who wants to know?
M	OTHER PRISONER	Nothin.' I know a Sean Costigan. L Street.
F	BILLY	My cousin. Connected but not too bright-- No offense.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Sorry I'm late.
M	ELLERBY	Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison with the undercover section. Their undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sgt. Dignam.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	OK. They're out there, my people. They're like the fuckin' Indians. You're not gonna see them. You're not gonna hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan. You will not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. This shit hole, unfortunately, has more fuckin' leaks than the Iraqi navy.
M	ELLERBY	Fuck yourself.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	I'm tired from fucking your wife.
M	ELLERBY	How's your mother?
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Good. She's tired from fucking my father. OK, today, girls, what I got for you is microprocessors. CONTINUED: Somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route 128. They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. That's what they do out there on "America's Technology Highway". Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie projects.
M	COLIN	What was his name? The, ah, departed.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in...
M	LAZIO	South Boston?
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Who forged your transcript, dickhead?
M	COLIN	I know that guy. His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.
M	ELLERBY	We are not here to solve the "Case of the Dead Scumbag". We are here to nail Costello.
M	SGT. DIGNAM	We got a guy says that he hears Costello is moving the processors to China...that he set up the whole fuckin' job and popped Kennefick. You don't want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.
M	ELLERBY	We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI (Bureau)...
M	LAZIO	Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently?
M	SGT. DIGNAM	Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day.
M	BILLY'S AUNT	Billy?
F	BILLY	Aunt Cathy?
M	BILLY'S AUNT	Good to see you. Good to see you. CONTINUED:
M	BILLY'S AUNT	They said you were in the Staties, I couldn't believe it.
F	BILLY	I got kicked out about four months ago.
M	SEAN	It was in the papers.
F	BILLY	Well. So you know.
M	SEAN	And why are we graced with your presence?
F	BILLY	I brought your mother some pictures of my father.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	My mother had them. My mother's dead.
M	SEAN	I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your troubles.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a matter of fact. You workin'?
F	BILLY	No.
M	SEAN	When did I see you after that?
F	BILLY	Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think.
M	SEAN	Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had that fuckin' buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the doors at the hotel. I was trippin'...All of them. That was a night.
F	BILLY	Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance.
M	SEAN	Yeah?
F	BILLY	In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?
M	SEAN	My line of work... I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars.
F	BILLY	That's what I'm saying.
M	SEAN	You know what we usually say at these moments. CONTINUED: You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin.
M	SEAN	Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	Double the money, double the fun. Cinnamon toasty apple bun... R is for Ricans...P is for pigs...
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	I can't stop drinkin.
F	BILLY	Why would you even think of stopping drinking?
M	SEAN	He don't like it. He don't like drinkin...he don't like fightin... ...he says stay out of the bars... You know, we're not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin' Worcester.
F	BILLY	Who says?
M	SEAN	He says. Costello says. God says, as far as you're concerned.
M	SEAN	Not a cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks like his shit don't stink but he's good people.
M	VILLAIN	Cunt cop.
M	MISTER FRENCH	I knew his father. I liked his uncle Jackie better.
M	SEAN	Uncle Jackie was excellent.
M	AN IRISH VILLAIN	Fucking guineas.
F	BILLY	A cranberry juice.
M	WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR	It's a natural diuretic. My girlfriend drinks it when she got her period. You got your period?
F	BILLY	Get your hands off me.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Do you know me? CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	No.
M	MISTER FRENCH	I'm the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you don't. That's not quite a guy you can't hit, but it's almost a guy you can't hit, so I'm fucking ruling on it right now that you don't hit him, understand?
F	BILLY	Yeah. Excellent. Fine.
M	MISTER FRENCH	I know you. I know your family. Also I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop- magnet cousin I'll forget your grandmother was very nice to me and cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that?
F	BILLY	Yeah.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Now you know me.
F	BILLY	Yeah.
M	MISTER FRENCH	What are you drinking?
F	BILLY	Cranberry juice.
M	MISTER FRENCH	What is it, your period?
M	MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)	Get him a cranberry juice.
M	MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)	That's Jackie's nephew.
M	WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG	Oh...
M	MISTER FRENCH	Oh, what?
F	FRENCH	Get the fuck out of here.
M	COLIN	Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those responsible. Don't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him?
M	MRS KENNEFICK	Allegedly.
M	COLIN	"Allegedly".
M	MRS KENNEFICK	If he was killed he probably did something wrong.
M	COLIN	You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick? That's not what you think he did wrong.
M	COSTELLO	Wave to your girlfriend.
M	MRS KENNEFICK	I mean fuck yourself.
M	COLIN	You get that?
M	BARRIGAN	"Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?"
M	COLIN	Welcome to the neighborhood.
M	COSTELLO	Cut 'em here.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Bye, bye. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	Making a house call?
F	MADOLYN	Have I seen you professionally?
M	COLIN	No, no. I know what you do. I know who you are.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	When guys have to "use their "service revolvers" in the "course of duty" they get to talk to you about their "feelings" and whatnot.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.
F	MADOLYN	I have an appointment on this floor.
M	COLIN	That's good. They're all fuckin' crazy on that floor. I'm one floor up.
F	MADOLYN	Oh, fancy policeman.
M	COLIN	That's right. Fancy.
F	MADOLYN	Are you a Statie?
M	COLIN	Yeah, I'm also getting my law degree.
F	MADOLYN	Suffolk, nights?
M	COLIN	They don't run Harvard Law at night, last time I checked.
F	MADOLYN	When was the last time you checked?
M	COLIN	Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
F	MADOLYN	I went to U Mass. I wasn't insulting you.
M	COLIN	Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner.
F	MADOLYN	Maybe you could shoot someone and I'd have to see you professionally.
M	COLIN	Whatever it takes. I'll stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I don't need a card, I'm a detective.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I'm only joking. Nice to meet you... "Madolyn". I didn't know about your tail until I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day.
F	BILLY	You guys from Providence?
M	PROPRIETOR	What have you done to my place! Get out of here. CONTINUED: You also do probation work, right?
F	MADOLYN	That's right. I see "violent offenders".
M	COLIN	Bad guys.
F	MADOLYN	That's one way to look at it. Not necessarily.
M	COLIN	That have this and they don't have duck l'orange.
F	MADOLYN	Was your dinner OK?
M	COLIN	Oh, the lobster was excellent. I just thought, French restaurant...
F	MADOLYN	I'm waiting for you to make your move.
M	COLIN	I don't know what you're gonna do, but if it moves I'm going to arrest it (shoot it). What's it like having people "find themselves?" All day long people "finding themselves." Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around the room?
F	MADOLYN	Why, does that make you uncomfortable?
M	MADOLYN (CONT'D)	You know what Freud said about the Irish?
M	COLIN	Yes I do.
F	MADOLYN	If you actually do I'll see you again.
M	COLIN	Who says I want to see you again?
F	MADOLYN	Don't you?
M	COLIN	Yes, course I do. What Freud said about the Irish is We're the only people impervious to psychoanalysis.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Tough luck for you with a client list of Mick cops, isn't it. "Opening up"? Good luck to you. Why do you do it?
F	MADOLYN	Some people do get better.
M	COLIN	Fair enough.
F	MADOLYN	Sometimes, though, I want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.
M	COLIN	Including the criminals?
F	MADOLYN	If they don't do their jobs you don't have one.
M	COLIN	Me? I'd just arrest innocent people. I'll arrest you right now.
F	MADOLYN	You're trouble.
M	COLIN	You don't know the half of it. around)... CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	Do you know who I am?
F	BILLY	No.
M	COSTELLO	You met my friend, Mister French the other night.
F	BILLY	Is his real name Mister French?
M	COSTELLO	No. Come with me. I'm not the cops. I'm not askin' you.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence, and this can cause problems for me.
M	COSTELLO	Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them?
F	BILLY	Is it something I can't do personally? CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	I'm going to have my associate search you.
F	BILLY	Search me? Search me for what?
M	MISTER FRENCH	C'm here.
M	COSTELLO	Contra-fucking-band. Take your fuckin' shoes off.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Shoes off.
M	COSTELLO	I knew your father.
F	BILLY	Yeah. He's dead.
M	COSTELLO	I'm sorry. How did he go?
F	BILLY	He didn't complain.
M	COSTELLO	That was his problem.
F	BILLY	Who said he had a fuckin' problem.
M	COSTELLO	I just said he had a fuckin' problem. There's a man could have been anything.
F	BILLY	Are you saying he was nothing?
M	COSTELLO	I'm saying he worked at the airport.
M	MISTER FRENCH	He's clean.
M	COSTELLO	The arm.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	It makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the Staties, and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in...that department, anyway.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Are you still a cop?
F	BILLY	No.
M	COSTELLO	You swear on your mother's grave that you're not a cop.
F	BILLY	I am not a cop. You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin?
F	BILLY	Yes!
M	COSTELLO	Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas.
M	COSTELLO	in my bar?
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Only kidding. How's your mother?
M	JIMMY	Ah, she's on her way out.
M	COSTELLO	We all are. Act accordingly.
M	COSTELLO	Do you trust him?
M	MISTER FRENCH	These days, who's reliable? CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	His Uncle Jackie was.
M	MISTER FRENCH	The Costigans are talented in general.
M	COSTELLO	You don't trust a guy behaves like he's got nothin' to lose.
M	MISTER FRENCH	I'm reliable.
M	COSTELLO	Well, you're one in a million.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Ten million.
M	COSTELLO	What about your wife?
M	MISTER FRENCH	I thought she was.
M	COSTELLO	She wasn't.
M	MISTER FRENCH	She got reliable.
F	GWEN	Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?
M	COSTELLO	"Another county heard from."
M	MISTER FRENCH	One too many.
M	COLIN	The principles of detection tell me that these men came from Providence.
M	LYNN DETECTIVE	I'd appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene.
M	COLIN	This is my crime scene, but knock yourself out.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I saw a dead guy. I think I have post traumatic stress. You available for lunch? See you then.
M	COSTELLO	Who's the lead detective?...Good, he's a moron.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	I want you to get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of course he had nothing to do with it and will say so. You look in CONTINUED: his car...and find...the gun that did it.
M	COLIN	In the trunk or the glove box?... All right.
M	COLIN	Wanna see some dead guys?
M	COSTELLO	Have a seat, Billy.
F	BILLY	Thank you.
M	COSTELLO	You know John Lennon?
F	BILLY	Yeah, he was president before Lincoln.
M	COSTELLO	Lennon said `I'm an artist. You give me a fuckin' tuba and I'll get you something out of it'.
F	BILLY	I'd like to squeeze some fuckin' money out of it.
M	COSTELLO	Smart mouth. Too bad.
M	COSTELLO	The point with John Lennon is a man can look at anything and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think what can I use you for?
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Get rid of this. Maybe we can work something out. Let me get dressed.
M	DIGNAM	That was quick. He dead already? CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news.
M	BARRIGAN	No wonder you get ahead.
F	BILLY	I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. Micro what?
F	QUEENAN	Microprocessors. We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in twenty- odd years and Costello is selling them military technology. Microprocessors, chips, computer parts. Anybody says anything about anything like that, you let us know.
M	REPORTER	Did you have a tip from an informant?
M	ELLERBY	No, it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It's the right thing to do, personally I don't trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the State Police.
M	BROWN	Really?
M	COLIN	Yeah. Really.
M	BROWN	Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers?
M	COLIN	No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint me.
M	BARRIGAN	I know why I'm here. I made him feel guilty. Why are you here?
M	BROWN	Intelligence and aptitude.
M	BARRIGAN	That's new.
M	COLIN	Hello Dad. I have a new job.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Where's your fucking license? I don't see no fucking license.
M	BOOKIE	What license.
M	MISTER FRENCH	There's no such thing as a license, of course, but you definitely have to have one. If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.
M	HARD GUY	I was going for my fucking cigarettes...
M	MISTER FRENCH	Hey, that's Jimmy Bags. What the fuck you doin'? CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	What the fuck. I didn't know....
M	BOOKIE	There's no profit if I pay him two grand a week. I'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Then make more money or go out of business. This is America. If you don't make money you're a fucking douchebag. What are you going to do?
M	BOOKIE	Make more money.
M	MISTER FRENCH	That's the spirit.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Very interesting.
F	BILLY	Yeah, well. Fuck.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Don't worry about it. Guy didn't need need his teeth anyway. Maybe if he was an Eskimo. But in this country we eat a variety of items.
M	MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)	He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.
M	COSTELLO	So?
F	BILLY	He was... CONTINUED:
M	MISTER FRENCH	Reaching for his cigarettes.
F	BILLY	Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn't no reason----he put his hand in his coat! I don't know if he's a bookie or what the fuck he's doing...
M	COSTELLO	Well, you know what the fuck a bookie does?
F	BILLY	Pays you.
M	COSTELLO	Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Here. From now on call the bar and ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there's no Mikey. Wait. We'll call.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Forty-eight hours from the time this phone first rings, you take the fucking chip out - like so - and you fucking destroy it. After three days a phone ain't clean. If you use a phone which is not clean, you will have a accident. You never call us. We call you. You got that?
F	BILLY	I got it.
M	MISTER FRENCH	I can't fuckin' hear you.
F	BILLY	I got it.
F	BILLY	Don't look. There's a white van across the parking lot?
M	COSTELLO	They don't have directional microphones.
F	BILLY	What, do you got x-ray vision?
M	COSTELLO	They don't have directional microphones.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	People looking at you make you self- conscious?
F	BILLY	I don't know.
M	COSTELLO	Why? They're minuses. They can't tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal.
F	BILLY	Anyone not a criminal is a minus? CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	What are you soft? That's not what I said. Eat something, Jesus Christ, we got a nice day by the water. Sun's shining, gulls are up...Nice smell of ozone...
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	You know if your father were alive and saw you, sitting here with me, let's say he would have a word with me about this, in fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could do it, which is something you may not know about William Costigan, Sr.
F	BILLY	He never, ah, I mean never?
M	COSTELLO	He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money. You can't do a thing with a man like that. Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money. But even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I think about this.
F	BILLY	So what are talking about here?
M	COSTELLO	Fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I don't see you up the dog track as a general manager.
F	BILLY	Look at it this way. It's like a tuba. I want to see if I can get something out of it.
M	COSTELLO	You ever think of going back to school?
F	BILLY	With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school's out.
M	COSTELLO	Well that's your problem. Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Good day, Fathers.
M	PRIESTS	Good morning [day], Francis, good morning.
M	COSTELLO	You recall our chat? "I am as God made me", was that what you said? May I remind you, God don't run the bingo in this archdiocese.
M	YOUNG PRIEST	May I remind you, Mr. Costello, that pride comes before the fall.
M	COSTELLO	What comes before the Fall is the Summertime.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.
M	COLIN	I'm not making enough progress with Costello?
M	ELLERBY	"Progress" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up.
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough. Who did the two guys from Providence?
M	COLIN	Jimmy Pappas.
M	ELLERBY	And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?
M	COLIN	He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers. CONTINUED:
M	ELLERBY	Are you happy with this result?
M	COLIN	It's a result.
M	ELLERBY	Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.
M	COLIN	Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it.
M	ELLERBY	I think you are a cop, my son.
M	BRIAN	No, please...
F	FRENCH	Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt you. CONTINUED:
M	FRENCH (CONT'D)	Wake the fuck up.
F	QUEENAN	Hey. Let's go through the routine.
M	DIGNAM	You think you can pop someone. There's no special card to play. The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police Department.
F	BILLY	I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day.
M	DIGNAM	Most of the people in the world do it every day. What's the big deal?
F	BILLY	I'm not them.
M	DIGNAM	You're nobody. You signed the paper. We're the only people in the world who know that you're a cop. Maybe we'll just erase your file. CONTINUED: And zip, you're a soldier for Costello, open to arrest for how many felonies? Maybe we'll do that.
F	BILLY	Maybe I'll fucking kill you.
F	QUEENAN	Easy now. That was a joke, Billy.
M	DIGNAM	Just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy.
F	QUEENAN	Be smart. If someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you?
M	QUEENAN (CONT'D)	Get in the car. Keep your act together. It's just a little while longer.
F	BILLY	Costello? What's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. Get him for pissing in the street. What, are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?
M	DIGNAM	Well. That would stick...
F	QUEENAN	You shut up. We're building a case. It takes time. You know that.
F	BILLY	There's something wrong.
F	QUEENAN	Maybe. Maybe.
M	DIGNAM	Keep your ears opened. No bullshit.
F	QUEENAN	I want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the Special Investigation Unit. You hear anything like that?
F	BILLY	Are you serious?
F	QUEENAN	I'm afraid so.
F	BILLY	Jesus H. Christ.
F	QUEENAN	Hang tight for me. Just a little longer. We're this close.
F	BILLY	Okay.
F	QUEENAN	Thank you, Billy
M	COLIN	What have you got?
M	BROWN	Uniform clipped him on the Pike for a suspended licence. However, as he's the subject of an open investigation----
M	COLIN	At least one. He's one of Costello's crew.
M	BROWN	----we're entitled to get a warrant. We can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.
M	COLIN	Who's the lawyer?
M	BROWN	He didn't know the name. He just had the number on a card. Beeper number.
M	COLIN	Did he beep him?
M	BROWN	Twice.
M	COLIN	All right.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Give me your phone. Turn the camera off. Turn it off. CONTINUED:
M	BROWN	What?
M	COLIN	Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this? I'm gonna take this.
M	BROWN	He can't do that, can he?
M	BARRIGAN	He just did.
M	COLIN	Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.
M	FITZY	You my attorney?
M	COLIN	What do you think? Did you make any statements or phone calls I need to be aware of?
M	FITZY	I beeped you. The card they gave me...that's it.
M	COLIN	That's it? Don't you have to call your mother and tell her you're not gonna be home for supper? CONTINUED: The cameras are off. Call your mother.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Lookit. They're in there suiting up for a raid. I don't know where they are going, but they do. And so do you. Call your mum.
M	FITZY	Mum, I'm not gonna make it for supper. I got held up. Yeah, talk to you later.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Everybody out. Move.
M	FITZY	Who are you? When do I get out of here? CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day.
M	COLIN	Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra.
M	BROWN	Why'd you use my phone?
M	COLIN	Because you didn't go in there.
F	MADOLYN	The light's nice here in the morning.
M	MADOLYN (CONT'D)	It's all right. Guys tend to make a big deal out of it. It's actually quite common.
M	COLIN	I gotta go to work.
F	BILLY	It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing. CONTINUED:
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	People make things up in confession. You know that?
F	MADOLYN	I know they do.
F	BILLY	People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films.
F	MADOLYN	That's an interesting observation.
F	BILLY	Do you lie?
F	MADOLYN	Why do you?
F	BILLY	I'm asking if you lie.
F	MADOLYN	Honesty isn't synonymous with truth.
F	BILLY	You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?
F	MADOLYN	I expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel.
F	BILLY	So, you had a parent who was a drunk?
F	MADOLYN	Did you?
F	BILLY	No.
F	MADOLYN	Let's keep this with you.
F	BILLY	There was a cop leaving when I came in.
F	MADOLYN	How do you know he was a cop?
F	BILLY	Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops?
F	MADOLYN	That's part of what I do. Although, I don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy.
F	BILLY	You should get a better job... Do they all come in and cry...your cops?
F	MADOLYN	Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons.
F	BILLY	Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV.
F	MADOLYN	I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail?
F	BILLY	You want to hear about the showers?
F	MADOLYN	Did something happen to you? No. You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand...steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever.
F	MADOLYN	What do you expect from coming here?
F	BILLY	I have to come here.
F	MADOLYN	I know it's not elective...on your part...but, now that you're here, what do you want?
F	BILLY	You want the truth? Valium.
F	MADOLYN	If you lied, you'd have an easier time getting what you wanted.
F	BILLY	What's that say about what you do for a living?
F	MADOLYN	Look, I think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions.
F	BILLY	I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks.
F	MADOLYN	Is this true?
F	BILLY	Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here.
F	MADOLYN	Yes, you are.
F	BILLY	If only fuckin' here.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Two pills. Why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit?
F	MADOLYN	You can leave!
F	BILLY	What if that was a legitimate threat? (Hot shot).
F	MADOLYN	Fuck...
F	MADOLYN	Why is the hardest patient of the day always the last one?
F	BILLY	Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not supernatural.
F	MADOLYN	Look, I'm not just...somebody you have to see or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you.
F	BILLY	What's this?
F	MADOLYN	My card. And a prescription for twenty Lorazepam.
F	BILLY	Is it enough to kill myself?
F	MADOLYN	Maybe it is. All right? Have I done my job up to your goddamned standards? Because by my standards you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior, and fuck you if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.
F	BILLY	Thank you. CONTINUED:
F	MADOLYN	I'm transferring you to another counselor.
F	BILLY	You wanna get a cup of coffee?
M	ELLERBY	All right, let's bring it in, please. Come in please. Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don't know what they are. You don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team... Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones.
M	COLIN	Did you guys know anything about this?
M	ELLERBY	How long have we been tapped on this building?
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	Our unit will not take action until a man Captain Queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction. Questions? Anyone? This is who we're after. CONTINUED: We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him. Get to work.
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	We've been after this son of a bitch for a long time, and we're getting him tonight. Get to work.
M	COLIN	Go find out what we're doing and get on it.
M	ELLERBY	Sorry to get you at the last minute. But things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy.
M	COLIN	Dad?
M	COSTELLO (O.S.)	Yes?
M	COLIN	I'm not going to make dinner. Something big has come up.
M	COSTELLO	Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamned day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends.
M	COLIN	Oh, my friends are still coming.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	We'll just say lunch tomorrow. All right, bye.
F	QUEENAN	The readiness is all. You know the players, call the game.
M	COLIN	Thank you, Captain.
M	GEEK COP	Piece of cake. I'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log them.
F	QUEENAN	All cellphone signals are under surveillance through the courtesy there...
M	ELLERBY	Patriot Act. Love it. Love it. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46.
M	BROWN	Who are they meeting?
M	ELLERBY	I don't know. Some Chinamen from points unknown. They're already inside.
M	CAMERA GEEK COP	We have a blind spot.
M	ELLERBY	Why do you have a blind spot?
M	CAMERA GEEK COP	We had two hour's notice. Two hours. What the fuck you think this is, NASA?
M	ELLERBY	It never crossed my mind. You get a camera in the back? CONTINUED:
M	TECH COP IN DOWN VEST	What back?
M	COSTELLO	Turn off your cell phones.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Check your weapons...Fitzy has the chicken...
M	CAMERA COP	Maybe if we had some Homeland security money like some other fucking douchebags I could mention...
F	QUEENAN	Any calls?
M	PHONE TECH COP	They turned off their phones.
M	ELLERBY	Search randomly for calls made from the area. CONTINUED:
M	PHONE TECH COP	Eight hundred seven phones are live in this area.
M	ELLERBY	Narrow the area.
M	LAZIO	What you see for coverage is what you get.
M	DIGNAM	Why the fuck did they turn off their phones?
M	PHONE TECH COP	Wait, there's still one phone up.
M	DIGNAM	Where?
F	QUEENAN	The buyers are there.
M	ELLERBY	You know, direct access to your fucking guys would have certain fuckin' advantages.
F	QUEENAN	Not to my guy.
M	DIGNAM	This is unbelievable. Fuck it, who put the cameras in the fucking place?
M	CAMERA TECH COP	Who the fuck are you.
M	DIGNAM	I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.
F	QUEENAN	Hey, hey, hey...
M	COSTELLO	How you going, Robert?
M	CHINESE TRANSLATOR	Tops, Mr. Costello. I want to tell you that at least two of these gents have machine guns.
M	CHINESE GANGSTER	Waiting, waiting. We almost departed! This man is from the Embassy. He will have to blow his brains out if he is captured. His entire family will be killed.
M	CHINESE TRANSLATOR	He's a little upset.
M	COSTELLO	Tell him light on the starch. CONTINUED:
M	CHINESE TRANSLATOR	He's fronting the Chinese government and he's just scared shitless.
M	COSTELLO	Government man. I'm concerned about Chinamen who think it's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction.
M	CHINESE GANGSTER	Ngup, Ngup, Ngup. Ngaw um ming. Kay ngup mutt. [Yap, yap, yap. I don't understand. What is he saying?]
M	COSTELLO	For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here, in this country, it don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.
M	CHINESE GANGSTER	Put away that machine gun.
M	COSTELLO	If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century, you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	What we generally do in this country is one guy shows up with the items, and the other guy pays him. No tickee...no laundry.
M	CHINESE GANGSTER	Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon. [Make sure it's real. It's a million dollars.]. ALTERNATE/ALSO dong maw gok nay chun. [Next time you make me wait, I'm going to cut your dick off.
M	COSTELLO	In English, thank you, also.
M	CHINESE GANGSTER	Du ne. [Fuck you.]
M	COSTELLO	The expedition continues this way.
M	ELLERBY	Don't tell me those cars were empty. Please don't tell me those Chinamen's cars were empty. Do you have a camera in the back.
M	ELLERBY (CONT'D)	Can I talk to you a minute?
M	COSTELLO	See, no surveillance here. They didn't figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with.
F	BILLY	What about us, Frank? What're we gonna do?
M	COSTELLO	We depart. We didn't commit no illegalities.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Except sell the ching chongs a bunch of fuckin' plastic. CONTINUED:
F	MADOLYN	Good Morning.
M	COLIN	Good morning.
F	MADOLYN	I beat the movers.
M	COLIN	How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment?
F	MADOLYN	Lonely.
M	COLIN	I'm glad to hear that. It sucked here, too.
F	MADOLYN	I'm gonna thank your Uncle Alphonsus for the square footage.
M	COLIN	Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven. So am I. CONTINUED:
F	MADOLYN	French donut?
M	COLIN	Yeah. Hey, can I...
F	MADOLYN	Sure yeah.
M	COLIN	Well, we're not having this out.
F	MADOLYN	What?
M	COLIN	You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company.
F	MADOLYN	Company?
M	COLIN	Why work for the state?
F	MADOLYN	Why not? You do.
M	COLIN	Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor?
F	MADOLYN	I believe in public service.
M	COLIN	Now you're just being ridiculous.
F	MADOLYN	You like me living here?
M	COLIN	Yes I do.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Answer it. You live here.
F	MADOLYN	Mayor Sullivan's Office.
M	MADOLYN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry!
M	COLIN	Who is it?
F	MADOLYN	I think it's a guy with a, ah, A cancer guy.
M	COLIN	Hello?
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Something for work.
M	COSTELLO (V.O.)	What the fuck is it with your phone?
M	COLIN	Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have any power, that's all. It just happened once.
M	COSTELLO	Was that that shrink cunt answered the phone?
M	COLIN	Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in, so she moved in.
M	COSTELLO	You better get organized, quick.
M	COLIN	Last time I checked, I tipped you off and you're not in jail.
M	COSTELLO	Are you listening to me?
M	COLIN	Yes. CONTINUED: Are listening to me, son? Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking your cock?
M	COLIN	Yes. Yes I do.
M	COSTELLO	So earn it. I'm gettin' the feeling we got a cop in my crew.
M	COLIN	I been gettin' that same feeling.
M	COSTELLO	He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?
M	COLIN	Look, I have no access to undercover files in Queenan's department. It's locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the snitches. They don't give anybody a peep. I'm doing the best...
M	COSTELLO	Your best? What do you think we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery business?
M	COLIN	Please Frank, if you don't relax I can't relax. Let's start with this...get me all the information on the people around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first names. Get me...
M	COSTELLO	Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for?
M	COLIN	Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you please get me social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names, dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything that you don't get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a...
M	COSTELLO	Collie, calm down or you'll shoot in your pants. I'll get you the records and whatnot. You'll have 'em but listen to me son, don't disappoint me on this, or some other guy will be putting their cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.
F	QUEENAN	How are you, Francis?
M	COSTELLO	My mother called me Francis.
F	QUEENAN	I know she did. And your father called you the tumor.
M	COSTELLO	Oh, what did your father call you, Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't around.
F	QUEENAN	Where are the real microprocessors, Frank? CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	Microprocessors...oh yeah, I heard that story. You arrested some Chinese government guy at the border carrying some light sockets or somethin'.
M	DIGNAM	I can't wait to wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face.
M	COSTELLO	Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?
F	QUEENAN	I will get you, Frank.
M	COSTELLO	If you could've you would've but I guess you like to go at your own pace.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Excuse me, I've got a date with some angels.
F	QUEENAN	Sooner than you think, Francis.
M	COLIN	What?
F	MADOLYN	You have a boss that has a laryngectomy?
M	COLIN	No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me. CONTINUED:
F	MADOLYN	You're lying to me.
M	COLIN	Not exactly. There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about.
F	MADOLYN	Okay, then say that.
M	COLIN	I will. Thank you.
F	MADOLYN	That's the movers.
M	COLIN	You still wanna stay?
F	MADOLYN	I do.
M	COLIN	All right. All right. I'm coming. CONTINUED: I'm gonna get on a plane unless you put Queenan on the phone.
M	DIGNAM	Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.
F	BILLY	Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan?
M	DIGNAM	He's not here.
F	BILLY	They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out.
M	DIGNAM	And how do we do that Mr... fucking genius who didn't even graduate the academy?
F	BILLY	Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan.
M	DIGNAM	Are you deaf? He's not here. Call me when you get something real. CONTINUED: It's me.
F	MADOLYN	I'm assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at all...
F	BILLY	Confucius say that?
F	MADOLYN	So you do...something radical.
F	BILLY	"Something radical," huh?
F	MADOLYN	...yeah, you do... Sometimes it's just a matter of picking a thing and doing it...
F	BILLY	So how long you been with this guy?
F	MADOLYN	Oh, four months. About four months.
F	BILLY	You love this guy?
F	MADOLYN	It's pretty serious, yeah, it is.
F	BILLY	A head case or anything? I'm just curious...
F	MADOLYN	No more than I am. CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	Then you're lucky. Considering the odds, right?
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Good, give him a shot.
F	MADOLYN	Doctors aren't supposed to have illusions.
F	BILLY	Yeah, that's because of vastly superior intelligence. Godlike, really.
F	MADOLYN	OK, I'm in a serious, newly serious, relationship...there are...ups and downs...everybody has doubts, problems -- I mean doubts.
F	BILLY	What would you do if he was standing right there and saw us?
F	MADOLYN	I'd lie. To keep things on an even keel. You know all about it. CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence?
M	BANKROBBER	Fucking now I do.
F	BILLY	What the fuck do you do.
M	BANKROBBER	What, I pay Costello and wait for him to trade me to the FBI? Cause that's what he does.
F	BILLY	FBI? What the fuck are you talking about.
M	BANKROBBER	Oh my God, is that French out there?
F	BILLY	What the fuck did you just say about the FBI?
M	BANKROBBER	Forget what I said. I'm fucking high, I'm high.
F	BILLY	Whatever's going through your very poor, very limited, brain...I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just fucking said.
M	BANKROBBER	Forget it, I'm high, I must be high, I would never say what you thought I said.
F	BILLY	Tell me what the fuck you said.
M	BANKROBBER	Why do you think he's not arrested? Costello's a protected FBI informant. He'll trade you out. I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts. It fucking hurts.
F	BILLY	Let's go.
F	BILLY	Hey, it's me.
F	QUEENAN	What do you want? What are you doing here?
F	BILLY	Come here.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Costello is giving people up to the FBI.
F	QUEENAN	The FBI?
F	BILLY	He gives information to the FBI. He's a protected informant. Aren't they trying to make it a Federal case? And it never gets made?
F	QUEENAN	Go around the back. Go around the back.
F	QUEENAN	My wife's asleep. She left supper out. Come and have something to eat. CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	No, I...
F	QUEENAN	We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and have something to eat.
M	ELLERBY	Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy like you since me. You'll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation Unit.
M	COLIN	I don't get it.
M	ELLERBY	We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit.
M	COLIN	Right.
M	ELLERBY	You'll investigate. Everybody. Anybody.
M	COLIN	Well, that's just a dream job for a cop.
M	ELLERBY	We have considered all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do. I have an immaculate record. CONTINUED: Play golf?
M	COLIN	No.
M	ELLERBY	That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form relationships. How's the wedding coming along?
M	COLIN	Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor.
M	ELLERBY	Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think: someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works.
M	COLIN	Oh, it's working. Overtime.
M	ELLERBY	I'm glad to hear that. CONTINUED:
M	MISTER FRENCH	Boss wants your real name, your social, your license number, all your bank account numbers.
F	BILLY	I don't have a bank account.
M	MISTER FRENCH	I'm a cash business myself.
F	BILLY	What's he doing, setting up IRAs?
M	MISTER FRENCH	You fill in the papers, real name, all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here.
M	MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)	No, I ain't.
M	DELAHUNT	Put the forms in there.
M	FITZY	I don't know if this is how you spell Citizens'.
F	BILLY	No, no, no. Jesus Christ.
M	FITZY	What are you, retarded? That ain't right.
M	DELAHUNT	Billy, he said to stay here.
F	BILLY	I'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot. I'm not staying.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Where you going?
M	ONSCREEN	Follow the envelope.
F	BILLY	Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.
F	QUEENAN	They can't. They are compromised.
M	COSTELLO	Oh yeah, be dirty. CONTINUED: See anything you like?
M	COLIN	Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot you.
M	COSTELLO	You're not indulging in self abuse are you?
M	COLIN	Frank, we got problems.
M	COSTELLO	I hope you're not turning into one of those sob sisters, who wants to get caught. You're not crackin' up are you?
M	COLIN	I don't crack up.
M	COSTELLO	Pick a place where any cop could see you...
M	COLIN	Why did you show up then?
M	COSTELLO	I own the place.
M	COLIN	Why am I not fuckin' surprised. Look...
M	COSTELLO	You're gettin' reassigned.
M	COLIN	How the fuck did you know that?
M	COSTELLO	Where'd they put you?
M	COLIN	I have to find myself.
M	COSTELLO	You're telling me, sonny boy.
M	COLIN	I have to find the guy you have in the department.
M	COSTELLO	With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding nothing.
M	COLIN	Frank, for me, you've got to lay low.
M	COSTELLO	Laying low is not what I do.
M	COLIN	Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank, what good am I to you if you don't listen to me? Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's fuckin' smart, you know that. I will find this rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job.
M	COSTELLO	Okay. But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you, that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won't be me who pays for it.
M	COLIN	Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this. It involves lying, and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right?
M	COSTELLO	Maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theatre.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Who knows what's easy? Collie, take care of business. CONTINUED:
M	TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL	Make arrest.
F	BILLY	Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients.
F	MADOLYN	How obsessive are you?
F	BILLY	Medium.
F	MADOLYN	Are you okay? Why are you here?
F	BILLY	I really liked our conversations. I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations.
F	MADOLYN	I'm glad you want to see me...it's nice to see you...I enjoyed talking...I enjoyed having coffee with you, very much...but I don't see people...I don't see people in my home.
F	BILLY	Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave. CONTINUED:
F	MADOLYN	No, it's, it's, it's not inappropriate...you're not a patient...
F	BILLY	You moving in or out?
F	MADOLYN	I still have three weeks on the lease...
M	MADOLYN (CONT'D)	That's me.
F	BILLY	Yeah, I know.
F	MADOLYN	Would you like a cup of tea?
F	BILLY	Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.
F	MADOLYN	Do you want some...
F	BILLY	Sugar? No...
F	MADOLYN	I've always needed my own place.
F	BILLY	Hedging your bets?
F	MADOLYN	No. I'm not "hedging my best"...I told you when we had coffee...There's a choice. You choose...you have to make a...
F	BILLY	Decision.
F	MADOLYN	...decision...and stick by what...you choose...you have to...
F	BILLY	Move in with your boyfriend?
F	MADOLYN	Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise it's... I have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now. Is it real?
F	BILLY	Yeah, I think so. You don't have cats.
F	MADOLYN	No.
F	BILLY	I like that. That's good.
M	COSTELLO	You got a girlfriend?
F	BILLY	No. No. What does that matter?
M	COSTELLO	Depends. I'm sure you know by now there's an informer in my crew. Cop. Staties or Boston Police department, I'm not sure.
F	BILLY	What about the FBI.
M	COSTELLO	It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife, an old friend or stupid...that's what brings you down in this business.
F	BILLY	Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.
M	COSTELLO	Past days, case like this...I killed everybody who works for me.
F	BILLY	Better safe than sorry, I suppose. CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	On the other hand, back then, it was only five...or six...and French.
F	BILLY	I look around at your guys. They're all murderers right? I think "could I do murder?" And all I can answer myself is, "what's the difference".
M	COSTELLO	Give em up to the Almighty. Like that.
F	BILLY	Yeah, that's my point. You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice, I quit. If you make me fear for my life, I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else.
M	COSTELLO	You got something you want to say to me, William?
F	BILLY	You're seventy fucking years old. One of these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. And you don't need the money.
M	COSTELLO	I haven't needed "the money" since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell the truth, I don't need pussy any more,but I still like it. Point I'm making...you see...I got this rat...gnawing, cheese eating fucking rat...questions come up...questions...see, Bill, you're the new guy...and the girlfriend. Why don't you stay in the bar when I get the numbers. Your numbers. Everybody's numbers.
F	BILLY	Is there something you want to ask me, Frank?
M	COSTELLO	Start with, you agree there is a rat?
F	BILLY	You said there is one. I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do.
M	COSTELLO	Sure, sure, all that aside...but you Bill, what would you do?
F	BILLY	How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise. The question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than you?
M	COSTELLO	Only one that can do what I do is me. You want to be me?
F	BILLY	I probably could be you. I know that much. But I don't want to be you. Heavy lies the crown...sort of thing.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Francis.
M	BARTENDER	We're out of here, Mister Costello. You'll have to set the alarm.
M	COSTELLO	Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	There's a boat coming in, up in Gloucester. French will give you all the details.
M	COSTELLO	You heard nothing?
M	COLIN	No.
M	COSTELLO	Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new guys, nothing about Gloucester?
M	COLIN	No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I would have heard about it.
M	COSTELLO	You're sure. No other departments, no codes, like that... CONTINUED:
M	COLIN'S VOICE	Frank. You can relax on this one.
M	COSTELLO	Okay, Collie. I will.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	It ain't Bill. No way, he says. Thank God for Billy.
M	COLIN	Morning.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	A problem?
M	DIGNAM	Yeah, I run rat fucks like you. I don't like them.
M	COLIN	The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours.
M	DIGNAM	Fuck yourself.
M	COLIN	I need to know the identity of your undercovers.
M	DIGNAM	Blow me. Not literally, there's no promotion in it for ya.
M	COLIN	Morning, Captain.
F	QUEENAN	Look who's here. The Queen of the prom.
M	COLIN	They are not happy with me. Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam.
F	QUEENAN	What do you expect? Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat.
M	COLIN	Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right?
F	QUEENAN	Two days ago, my undercover guy in Costello's organization----
M	COLIN	Who is that?
F	QUEENAN	Lots of luck. (Not a chance.) You can go over my head, high as you like. You still won't get an answer.
M	COLIN	Fair enough.
F	QUEENAN	As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is. He lost him in the street. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	Really? Did he get a look at him?
F	QUEENAN	...No.
M	COLIN	Nothing that could help us?
F	QUEENAN	Nah.
M	COLIN	(Too bad.) Any advice? Generally?
F	QUEENAN	without coordinating with his source... Who is here. In SIU. Follow Costello and you'll find his rat.
M	QUEENAN (CONT'D)	You're going to be looking at my people. Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me get you a coffee. Follow Costello and you'll find his informer.
M	VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)	Internal Investigations.
M	COLIN	This is Sullivan. I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now.
M	COLIN	If I wasn't with the Mass State Police. If I did it full time,law school, I'd be through in a year. I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a trooper.
F	MADOLYN	What's going on?
M	COLIN	Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing going on. Just thinking.
F	MADOLYN	Okay, all right. And what about money?
M	COLIN	I got some money. Another city...I'm thinking that.
F	MADOLYN	Another city? It'd be a clean slate. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	I want you to know you don't gotta stay. If we're not going to make it, it's got to be you that gets out. I'm not capable I'm fuckin' Irish, so I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.
F	MADOLYN	Not a bad idea, another city.
M	DELAHUNT	Of course I know how to spot a cop.
M	FITZY	Oh yeah, how's that?
M	DELAHUNT	If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop.
M	DELAHUNT (CONT'D)	See that guy over there, he's a cop. He's not paying attention to us. He's a cop.
M	FITZY	Lot of fucking cops. What kind of dog is that? CONTINUED: She's a cop.
M	DELAHUNT	She's probably the fucking Police Commissioner.
M	COSTELLO	You can get out of here. This is the crew for tonight.
F	BILLY	I thought I was on for that.
M	COSTELLO	I changed my mind. Take the night off. Jimmy, get the mop.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Go out the back. Some guys answer the questions right. Some don't.
M	DELAHUNT	You're a cop.
F	BILLY	Huh? CONTINUED:
M	DELAHUNT	You're ignoring us. You're a cop. We're guessing who cops are. Most good looking women are cops.
F	BILLY	Right. I'm going home. He's playing with his new boys.
M	DELAHUNT	See you later.
F	BILLY	Later.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	He's moving something with all new guys. (A whole new crew.) I don't want to tell you what or where. It might be disinformation. It probably is. Just keep following him. I need to see you today. No. Today.
M	DETECTIVE 1	Can I ask a question, Sergeant?
M	COLIN	Yes, go ahead.
M	DETECTIVE 2	Why the fuck are we following Captain Queenan? To find out about the good Catholic life? CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	I have to follow every lead, however unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities.
M	DETECTIVE 1	Who says I have delicate sensibilities?
M	COLIN	I have reason to believe that Queenan is Costello's informer. Follow him, and don't get made.
M	DETECTIVE 1	Copy that, Sarge We got him.
M	DETECTIVE 2	Sarge, we got the target.
F	QUEENAN	Where are you now? CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	Look down the car.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Got me?
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Any reason you'd have a tail?
F	QUEENAN	No...Of course not.
F	BILLY	I'm watching a guy...
F	QUEENAN	I don't have a tail, Billy.
F	BILLY	Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait there for ten minutes. After I leave I'll text message you the address where we'll meet. I'll make sure you don't have a tail.
F	QUEENAN	South Station. Wait ten minutes.
M	DETECTIVE 1	He went into a building on the waterfront. Address is 344 Wash...
M	DETECTIVE 1	He went to the top floor. It's empty. No tenants. I don't know what we're doing here.
M	COLIN	I think I've got him. I think Queenan is meeting with him right now.
M	DELAHUNT	Get the van. Get the boys.
F	QUEENAN	I assume these premises do not have an anti-smoking ordinance. So, what's going on?
F	BILLY	I told you, he's got dope coming in, I don't know where. He's getting spooky, Captain...
F	QUEENAN	What do you mean?
F	BILLY	He's crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood all over him. I can't get any more information for you. I can't trust it. He's not including his regular guys... I'm telling you, he's gonna find out who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill me, I know it.
F	QUEENAN	All right, all right. I hear you. I'm sorry for you trouble. Look, I'm not gonna jeopardize your safety any longer. I'll get you out. I can't do it overnight but I'll do it. We can bust him for what we have. At least I think we can...I hope. You're out of there ASAP.
F	BILLY	Yeah? What about the FBI?
F	QUEENAN	They're compromised.
F	BILLY	What?
F	QUEENAN	They're fucked, just like this lighter. CONTINUED:
M	DELAHUNT	Billy, where the fuck are you? We been trying to reach you. We found the rat. Top man says we're gonna take care of him. The address is 314 Washington Street. You got it? All right. See you there.
F	QUEENAN	What?
F	BILLY	You were fucking followed.
F	QUEENAN	By who?
F	BILLY	Costello's people.
F	QUEENAN	Impossible.
F	BILLY	No. One of the cops he's got inside tipped him. CONTINUED:
M	DETECTIVE 1	What the fuck is going on?
M	DETECTIVE 2	Holy fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's meeting with all of them.
M	COLIN	Yes.
F	BILLY	They'll be on the elevators, too.
F	QUEENAN	Take the back fire escape.
F	BILLY	What'll you do?
F	QUEENAN	I'll be fine. If you get made I can't protect you. Go down the fire escape. Now. That's an order. I'll be fine.
F	QUEENAN	Can I help you gentlemen?
M	FITZY	I guess we've had enough of this shit. Where's your boy?
M	DETECTIVE 1	Fuck! Something came off the roof.
M	COLIN	What came off the roof? What do you mean something came off the roof? Go again with that information.
M	FITZY	You're fuckin' late. Where the fuck were you? Get in the fuckin' van. CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	What the fuck happened? I came to meet you.
M	DETECTIVE 1	Stay in the fucking car. Stay in the fucking car. This is a surveillance unit. Do I pursue.
M	COLIN	No. Stay where you are. I need some fucking information here. What came off the building?
M	DETECTIVE 1	I'm not sure.
M	DETECTIVE 1	No pursuit. No pursuit.
M	DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)	Fuck that.
M	DETECTIVE 4	Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X to CP. We're being fired upon. I repeat.
M	DETECTIVE 4 (V.O.)	We have an officer down. An officer has been shot. Request immediate assistance.
M	FITZY	And where the fuck were you?
F	BILLY	Boss told me to go home.
M	FITZY	Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. At any rate you weren't fuckin' home.
F	BILLY	I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh?
M	DELAHUNT (OS)	Billy. Billy
F	BILLY	Jesus Christ. CONTINUED:
M	DELAHUNT	Two days...two days ago the Boss says to me, it's been ten years already, and you've never done me wrong. He asked me, if one of the other guys is a rat, would I take him out. I told him I would but I don't know if I would. Now I know I can't. I've done a lot of bad things but I've never been a murderer.
M	DELAHUNT (CONT'D)	Hey Billy, I don't want no one to put me in a dumpster. Just don't put me in a dumpster.
F	BILLY	When you're dead it makes no difference where they put you.
M	DELAHUNT	You know what I thought today?
F	BILLY	What's that?
M	DELAHUNT	Who didn't show up today is the rat.
F	BILLY	Yeah, so?
M	DELAHUNT	You never been late in your life. And when I called you... I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address. But you showed up at the right one.
M	DELAHUNT (CONT'D)	Tell me why I didn't say anything. Tell me why.
M	FITZY	That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop.
F	BILLY	He's dead. I'm going home.
M	ELLERBY	Do you know why Queenan went to that building?
M	COLIN	No.
M	DIGNAM	A better question is why your fuckers were following him.
M	COLIN	I told Internal Investigations to follow him.
M	DIGNAM	Why?
M	COLIN	That's internal Investigations business.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I have to investigate everybody and anybody. I don't have to justify anything. Nor does anyone have to like it. I now have information... CONTINUED: from a very good source...that Queenan may have been killed by his own undercover.
M	DIGNAM	That's a fucking lie.
M	COLIN	Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam here have information on this undercover, and other informants, in a locked file. I need those files unlocked.
M	DIGNAM	I don't have the password. Why don't you come down to the garage...
M	COLIN	That's a lie.
M	DIGNAM	No one calls me a liar. Especially when I'm lying.
M	ELLERBY	Everybody shut up. Work with the tech guys to unlock the files. Dignam. You take a leave of absence.
M	DIGNAM	Leave of what?
M	ELLERBY	Queenan's dead. That makes me your boss.
M	DIGNAM	I'll hand in my papers first.
M	COLIN	What?
M	ELLERBY	bartenders. Two weeks with pay.
M	DIGNAM	Good.
M	COLIN	I need those codes.
M	ELLERBY	No, you want those codes.
F	BILLY	I tried to call you a few times.
F	MADOLYN	I know. (I know.). I can't...
M	MADOLYN (CONT'D)	I can't be a friend to you. I can't. I'm sorry.
F	BILLY	It's okay, okay, I know.
M	COSTELLO	Now, when I hear Lucia, I can't stop thinking about the cocaine curtsy you did on that nigger broad's face. What? CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	Your shouldn't have killed Queenan.
M	COSTELLO	One of us was going to have to die. With me it tends to be the other guy.
M	COLIN	You're crazy, Frank. You killed the guy who has all the information. And Dignam's not in the office, he's gone. He resigned.
M	COSTELLO	I don't give a fuck about Dignam.
M	COLIN	He's fucking gone. They took his papers in. He's not talking. I don't know where he is.
M	COSTELLO	Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie. That Irish piss-ant won't be a problem. He's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it. Let's give him a whiff.
M	COLIN	I will.
M	COSTELLO	Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Sweetheart, you're giving me a hard- on.
F	GWEN	Are you sure it's me or all that talk about whiffin' and crawlin' up asses?
M	COSTELLO	Hey, watch your fucking mouth.
F	GWEN	You watch it.
M	GWEN (CONT'D)	Let me straighten you out.
M	COLIN	Yeah.
F	BILLY	You called this number on a dead guy's phone. Who are you?
M	COLIN	So it is you. Thank God you're all right. We were very worried. CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	Who are you?
M	COLIN	You're talking to Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit.
F	BILLY	Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it.
M	COLIN	Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a leave of absence. He's very upset. We're all very upset. The best thing would be for your to come in. We need you to come in.
M	NEWS ANCHOR	State Police have confirmed that the body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday afternoon is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the City of Boston.. This was the scene today.... If you have any information about this murder, you are urged to call the Boston Police. CONTINUED:
M	FITZY	Fuck. I can't believe it.
M	MISTER FRENCH	Don't believe what?
M	FITZY	I'm embarrassed. How the fuck did they find him so fast? I spent all fuckin' night out there, dragged the poor bastard.... I must have been there seven hours. In three feet of mud. What the fuck is a marsh? And who walks their dog in a fuckin' marsh? In three feet of water? I don't believe it. I still don't believe he's a fuckin' cop.
M	COSTELLO	The cops are saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop. Are you soft? The next time I tell you to dump a body in the marshes, put it in the fuckin' marshes, not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a blowjob!
M	COSTELLO (CONT'D)	Proceed.
M	COSTELLO	Jesus Christ. CONTINUED: What?
M	COLIN	Don't go. You've got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They won't be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you.
M	COSTELLO	Get rid of them.
M	COLIN	There's no need to go yourself, Frank.
M	COSTELLO	Get rid of the fuckin' tail!
M	COLIN	I will. All right.
M	COSTELLO	Tails. Fuckin' rats. This rat shit is wearing me thin.
F	FRENCH	Francis, they're all rats. Women are rats... cunts...Yeah, we're becoming a nation of rats.
M	COLIN	Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your team to stop following Costello. We don't need to surveil him. CONTINUED:
M	ELLERBY	What the fuck are you talking about?
M	COLIN	I have it from an undercover: Costello knows he's being followed. Let our UC take him in.
M	ELLERBY	What informant?
M	COLIN	Queenan's guy. He called me when he found out Queenan was dead. I'm running him.
M	ELLERBY	No. You give him to me.
M	COLIN	No. But I can give you Costello's destination.
M	ELLERBY	You know where he's going?
M	COLIN	Yes. And what he's about to do. Call off the tail, and get Special Ops. Get them on standby. We meet him where he's going. Suit up. We're gonna take this prick tonight.
M	BROWN	All units fall back. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	It's the heavy equipment warehouse Costello owns on Sheffield. He must have a container or a truck in there. Go.
M	COLIN	There's an exit on the other side. Cover it. We'll take him when he comes out.
M	COSTELLO	Load it.
F	BILLY	How do you know you don't have a tail? CONTINUED:
M	COSTELLO	Were you in the fuckin' car?
F	BILLY	What if they took one off and put another one on, Frank?
M	COSTELLO	Load.
F	BILLY	Frank told me to check out the back. You guys go ahead.
M	FNG DENNIS	Watch your ass.
M	COSTELLO	Cocksucker. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	You're an FBI informant.
M	COSTELLO	Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm talking to the FBI.
M	COLIN	Do they know who I am?
M	COSTELLO	I never gave up anybody who wasn't goin' down anyway.
M	COLIN	Did you give me up?
M	COSTELLO	Nobody knows nothin'.
M	COLIN	Frank, Frank, do they know about me?
M	COSTELLO	I know you, Colin. You know I'd never give you up. You're like...
M	COLIN	A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks?
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I got Costello! I got Costello here!
M	COLIN	It's not any reason for, ah...
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Thank you.
M	QUEENAN'S SECRETARY	No, thank you.
M	BROWN	He's waited a long time for you. How'd you get him without the files?
M	COLIN	Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy? CONTINUED:
M	BROWN	Yeah, we were classmates together.
M	COLIN	I'm gonna go talk to him.
M	COLIN	Good to see you Trooper.
F	BILLY	Yeah. "Trooper".
M	COLIN	Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How long have you been undercover?
F	BILLY	Long time. Long fuckin' time.
M	COLIN	I can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you. I want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit.
M	BILL	Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's kinda like a gold star around here, right?
M	COLIN	It's the highest honor we got.
F	BILLY	I just want my identity back.
M	COLIN	You want to be a cop again?
F	BILLY	No, being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back. CONTINUED: You'll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink.
M	COLIN	A police shrink. Was that... helpful for you?
F	BILLY	What are you gonna do about the rat in this building?
M	COLIN	I'm gonna find him. Don't you worry about that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything...
F	BILLY	I'm all done being a cop. I just want to get my money and go home.
M	COLIN	Fair enough. You've given a lot. I can get you your file. I just need your password.
F	BILLY	The password's my name, William Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to explain myself to someone like you.
M	COLIN	All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go in the other room. This computer's gone blooey on me.
F	BILLY	I know. I'm not here to...I'm not here for that. I've got something to...to give to you...something I need you to keep. For me.
F	MADOLYN	What is it? CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	I need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions. That's for you to hold.
M	BILLY (CONT'D)	Only you. Open this if I'm dead or if I call you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly what it says, please.
F	MADOLYN	All right.
F	BILLY	I'm sorry to show up here like this. There was no one else I could give it to. I'm sorry. There was no one else.
F	MADOLYN	I...we... I've, it's, been so confused... I just want to say...
F	BILLY	Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right? CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	I was dreaming...
F	MADOLYN	What?
M	COLIN	I was dreaming I was dead.
F	MADOLYN	Death is hard. Life is much easier.
M	COLIN	What's this?
F	MADOLYN	Open it
M	COLIN	Really?
F	MADOLYN	Yeah.
M	COLIN	Really?
F	MADOLYN	Yeah.
M	COLIN	You're joking...
F	MADOLYN	It's not a joke, it's a human being.
M	COLIN	What?
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Your guys shouldn't have done that.
M	COSTELLO	One of us was going to have to die. It tends to be the other guy.
M	COLIN	I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam.
M	COSTELLO	So Dignam's the only one with the keys to the kingdom.
M	COLIN	He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking.
M	COSTELLO	Give me his location. Tonight.
F	MADOLYN	I thought I was the liar.
M	COLIN	I can explain.
F	BILLY	Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried.
M	COLIN	What do you want?
F	BILLY	I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick.
M	COLIN	Where are you? CONTINUED:
F	BILLY	Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on.
M	COLIN	Did we not talk about this? This is my job.
F	BILLY	Get your hands up. Hands. Hands.
M	COLIN	Put the fuckin' gun down.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money.
F	BILLY	What did you say?
M	COLIN	I can get you your... CONTINUED:
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Fuck, shit...
F	BILLY	You didn't come here to talk, you fuckin' maggot, you came here to get arrested.
M	COLIN	Arrested? Arrested for what. So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant.
F	BILLY	Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.
M	COLIN	What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are.
F	BILLY	Would you shut the fuck up.
M	COLIN	I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU.
F	BILLY	You erased me?
M	COLIN	Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what happens.
F	BILLY	What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head.
M	COLIN	Watch what happens.
F	BILLY	What, you think you're gonna get the parade? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. I'm arresting you.
M	COLIN	That's the stupidest thing you could do.
F	BILLY	Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. I don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick. But I'm still fucking arresting you. [You are what you do.] Get up. I said get the fuck up.
M	BROWN	Put down the weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.
F	BILLY	I called you. You specifically. You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.
M	COLIN	Help me.
M	BROWN	Put the weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.
M	COLIN	Shoot the fuckin' prick.
F	BILLY	Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!
M	COLIN	Shoot the motherfucker!
M	BROWN	Put the weapon on the ground and we'll discuss it.
F	BILLY	He was Costello's rat. I got evidence. Tapes. Other documents.
M	BROWN	Maybe you do, but right now I need you to drop the weapon.
F	BILLY	I told you I've got the evidence cold linking this prick to Costello... You fuckin' know who I am. I'm taking him downstairs now.
M	COLIN	I can't wait for you to try to explain this to a Suffolk County grand jury. This is gonna be fun. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Just fucking kill me.
F	BILLY	I am killing you.
M	BROWN	Shit...
M	BARRIGAN	Did you think you were the only one he had? Costello was going to sell us to the FBI. It's you and me now. We have to take care of each other. You understand?
M	COLIN	All right. Give me that. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head. At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I'd like to go on record that I am recommending Trooper William Costigan for the Medal of Merit. CONTINUED:
M	COLIN	What about the baby?
M	COLIN	OK.
M	FREEZES.
