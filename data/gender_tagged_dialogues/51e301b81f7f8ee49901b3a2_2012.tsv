M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	Second Draft	
M	PROF. WEST	Watch out!
M	PROF. WEST	How deep are we?
M	SATNAM	8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir.
M	PROF. WEST	Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions.
M	SATNAM	Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me...
M	SATNAM (CONT'D)	There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe.
M	PROF. WEST	How can that be?
M	SATNAM	We don't know, Professor, sir.
M	SATNAM (CONT'D)	The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves.
M	POLITICAL AID #1	Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he was President. Did you hear, he wants us to sign in and out like school boys?
M	ADRIAN	I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House.
M	POLITICAL AID #2	Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress.
M	ADRIAN	Shame he's such a pompous ass.
M	ANHEUSER (O.S.)	Somebody mention my name?
M	ADRIAN	Yes sir... No, sir.
M	ANHEUSER	Which one is it?
M	ADRIAN	We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir.
M	ANHEUSER	It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that.
M	POLITICAL AID #2	That guy scares the shit out of me.
M	ADRIAN	Professor West?
M	PROF. WEST (O.S.)	I've been trying to reach you!
M	PROF. WEST	Listen, Adrian. The situation is much worse than we thought...
M	ADRIAN	Sir, the President needs to know this.
M	ANHEUSER	Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor?
M	ADRIAN	Four months this week.
M	ANHEUSER	I would say that's enough time to learn that we have rules here. You'll just have to wait until the quarterly science briefing.
M	ADRIAN	If this is about what I said last night, I am truly sorry, sir.
M	ANHEUSER	So you didn't like my speech?
M	ADRIAN	Can you please have a look at this, sir? It's really important.
M	ANHEUSER	Who wrote this?
M	ADRIAN	An Indian astrophysicist I graduated with from Harvard and Prof. West, the preeminent geologist in the US.
M	ANHEUSER	Who else knows about it?
M	ADRIAN	No one, sir.
M	ANHEUSER	Let's keep it that way, Helmsley. Good Morning...
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	I hereby present a motion to meet privately with my seven fellow Heads of State, kindly excluding the rest of the delegates.
M	RUSSIAN INTERPRETER	Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his interpreters present.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Mr. President, judging from the conversations we've had in the past, I can assure you, your English is absolutely fine, for what I have to say.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	Six months ago I was made aware of a situation so devastating, that at first, I refused to believe it. However through the concerted efforts of the brightest scientists of several nations, we have now confirmed its validity.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	The world as we know it, will soon come to an end.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You will have new houses, electricity and running water... ... Some among you will even have the chance to work for the glorious People's Republic of China building the biggest dam project in the world...
M	LIN	I will send you money mother.
M	COLONEL	Who can read and write?
M	COLONEL (CONT'D)	Who can weld?
M	MI-6 OFFICER (O.S.)	Has his Highness had the opportunity to study the dossier?
M	SAUDI PRINCE	You must understand I have a very big family. Mister...
M	MI-6 OFFICER	Isaacs.
M	SAUDI PRINCE	Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a lot of money.
M	MI-6 OFFICER	I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your Highness.
M	MANFRED PICARD	Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in your people.
F	LAURA	There are too many crazy people who could hurt her, Manfred. The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world.
M	MANFRED PICARD	And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in the Swiss Alps?
F	LAURA	Perfectly safe.
M	NEWSCASTER (O.S.)	... The mass suicide was discovered by a BBC documentary crew in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal...
M	NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)	... the victims were said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche Calender which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st of December this year, due to the sun's destructive forces...
M	NEWSCASTER (O.S.)	... Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history...
F	JACKSON	Oh no. Not again. Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30...
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Damn it! Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake...
F	JACKSON	They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun?
F	JACKSON	... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way.
M	NEIGHBOR	Merrill, we should move back to Wisconsin.
M	RADIO HOST (O.S.)	... Those shake-proof coffee mugs are a genius idea, and they just show the true nature of us Californians.
M	RADIO HOST (O.S.) (CONT'D)	We'll not bow to little inconveniences like these so called `mini-quakes'...
M	RADIO HOST (O.S.)	... If you have a funny `mini-quake' story you wanna share, call Lisa & Randy at 1-800...
M	NOAH	Jackson, what is this?
F	JACKSON	Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your father.
M	LILLY (O.S.)	Noah! Look! Daddy's got Space-Busters in the car... and Space-Busters 2. Awesome!
F	KATE	So what, you're a chauffeur now? What happened to the temp work?
F	JACKSON	This is better hours for me. Means I can still write.
F	KATE	Of course.
M	GORDON	Simone, how many times have I told you, we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too messy.
M	GORDON (CONT'D)	Have fun guys. And watch out for those bears. Nice car.
F	KATE	Noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day...
M	KATE (CONT'D)	... and Lilly has to put these on, before she goes to sleep.
F	JACKSON	Still?
F	KATE	Jackson, they've been really looking forward to this you know. Don't let them down.
M	HARRY	So this time we'll hit the Japs.
M	TONY	So what?
M	HARRY	Well Tony, electronics are cheap there and... you could visit your boy Will.
M	TONY	Afternoon ladies...
M	HARRY	Are you even listening to me?
M	TONY	Yes unfortunately I am Harry.
M	HARRY	I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now.
M	TONY	Why don't you keep your nose out of my family. You're cramping my style.
M	HARRY	He married a Japanese girl - how is that the end of the world? You should at least go see him.
M	TONY	Why? Do you see your boy?
M	HARRY	Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long way. But at least we talk.
M	TONY	What about?
M	HARRY	Life, how short it is...
M	TONY	What the hell was that?
M	MANFRED PICARD (O.S.)	Laura? They lied to us.
F	LAURA	Manfred is that you?
M	MANFRED PICARD	I had my suspicions. I should have said something. They are following me.
M	LAURA (O.S.)	Who is?
M	MANFRED PICARD	They may be listening to us too. Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham.
M	LAURA (O.S.)	What?
M	MANFRED	The art you collected, it's not in the Alps. Then where is it?
M	JACKSON AND LILLY	`We all live in a Yellow Submarine...'
M	RADIO HOST	... After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, I told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows...
F	LILLY	What happened to the music?
F	JACKSON	Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment...
M	RADIO HOST	... There's been government people flying in and out all morning. And trust me, they did not look happy...
M	RADIO HOST (CONT'D)	... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie.
F	LAURA	You have to see this.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	It's alright Sally.
M	CNN ANCHOR	... Mr. Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years. As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997.
F	LAURA	I just talked to him, Dad. He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham. Is that true? You knew too? You sleep with me and you didn't say anything?
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	I can't even look at you. Either of you!
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Honey, calm down.
F	LAURA	A man was killed! I want the truth Dad. Right now.
M	LILLY (O.S.)	Daddy, where are we going?
F	JACKSON	To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love. Remember the book I gave you?
M	NOAH	I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. I'm not ready for that, Jackson.
F	JACKSON	I'm your dad, Noah. Daddy!
F	JACKSON	This wasn't here before.
M	NOAH	Don't you see the signs?
F	JACKSON	It's fine guys.
F	JACKSON	It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone. I swear you guys there was a lake here.
M	NOAH (O.S.)	Jackson!
F	JACKSON	It's okay, Noh'.
M	ADRIAN	I'll be with you in a second, Professor.
M	OFFICER	... And then you climbed over a posted fence? Just like that?
M	NOAH	I told you.
F	JACKSON	Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway?
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	We're geologists...
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
F	JACKSON	So, where did the lake go?
M	ADRIAN	That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	... Curtis.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'?
F	JACKSON	Yeah, that's me.
M	ADRIAN	What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space.
F	JACKSON	You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
M	ADRIAN	Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me.
F	JACKSON	Oh, I see.
M	ADRIAN	Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
F	LILLY	He was very nice.
F	JACKSON	Yes he was, Lil'bee.
M	CHARLIE FROST	What did the government guys tell you?
F	JACKSON	They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable.
M	CHARLIE FROST	Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable! That's funny...
M	NOAH	There are mosquitos in here. Did anybody spray the tent?
F	JACKSON	We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie.
F	LILLY	Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book.
F	JACKSON	I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups?
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Did mommy buy you that?
M	NOAH	No... Gordon gave it to me for my birthday.
F	JACKSON	Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family.
M	NOAH	What family?
F	JACKSON	Go to sleep guys.
M	ADRIAN	... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected. Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm... ... But you guys said...
M	ADRIAN	We were wrong! By five or six months...
M	ON THE RADIO	... We have a listener calling in. Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show. I wanted to know, where will this all start?
M	ON THE RADIO (CONT'D)	Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But seriously, they've got the earth cracking under their asses already, Bill.
M	ON THE RADIO (CONT'D)	Our family believes in the gospel of our Lord Jesus. We have nothing to fear, Charlie. Good for you Bill, good for you!
M	CHARLIE FROST	... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano.
F	JACKSON	Hi. Mind if I join you?
M	CHARLIE FROST	I only got a few minutes.
F	JACKSON	I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood?
M	CHARLIE FROST	Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast...
F	JACKSON	What are you talking about?
M	CHARLIE FROST	The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of... I got to eat... Just check my blog. You can download it for free.
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	... However, we do take donations.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange...
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'...
M	CHARLIE FROST	... and Albert Einstein endorsed it...
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	The forces of mother nature will be so devastating it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice 12-21-12.
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on YouTube. I did the animation myself. I know what you're thinking. But all the governments know about this.
F	JACKSON	If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us?
M	CHARLIE FROST	They can't. Just think about it. First the stockmarket would crash...
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	Then the economy... boom. The dollar... boom. And then the people in the streets... Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution, war! They would never tell us. Beer?
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates, or maybe one of those Russian billionaires do you stand a chance to buy a seat.
F	JACKSON	A seat?
M	CHARLIE FROST	They're building spaceships, man.
F	JACKSON	Oh... I see.
M	CHARLIE FROST	No really... One of my listeners, a geography professor at UTSC, has even figured out where they're building them. He sent me a map.
F	JACKSON	Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My kids are sleeping.
M	CHARLIE FROST	Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's gonna get ugly here.
F	JACKSON	Night, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE FROST	Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in times like these, a man has got to eat...
M	GORDON	Why don't we make a baby?
F	KATE	Stop it! We're in public.
M	GORDON	Honey, I created them. And now suddenly I can't touch them?
M	GORDON (CONT'D)	You always act strange after he shows up?
F	KATE	Just because I don't care for your arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting strange. He is the father of my kids.
M	GORDON	Maybe biologically. Can I remind you what that guy did? First you gave up med school to have Noah... Then you practically raise him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk.
F	KATE	Some of his stuff is actually... He's published Gordon.
M	GORDON	Yeah, published! You know your mother was right. You've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets. But not this time right, sweetheart?
F	KATE	Did you see that?
M	GORDON	See what?
M	GORDON (CONT'D)	You know Kate, we have to keep working at this... our relationship. Because I won't end up being just a re-run of you and Jackson. I mean Honey, I feel like... something is pulling us apart?
F	JACKSON	Just stop scratching. You'll get them infected.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Something for Mosquito bites please?
M	CASHIER	Before or after?
F	JACKSON	What?
M	CASHIER	I'd get before and after.
F	LILLY	Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on TV!
M	NOAH	That's our supermarket.
F	JACKSON	Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy.
M	ANHEUSER	Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Is this even possible? What's our information from China?
M	ANHEUSER	They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Only four?
M	ANHEUSER	If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	I would like to pass this over to my science advisor, Adrian Helmsley.
M	ADRIAN	I'll make this brief...
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated...
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours.
M	GERMAN CHANCELLOR	How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley?
M	ADRIAN	Two, maybe three days if we're lucky.
M	ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER	How can you speak about luck in such a situation?
M	ANHEUSER	Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision. Introducing the 320 pound muscle machine from the Ukraine...
M	BOXING ANNOUNCER	... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. Here he is... Mister Zultan Balashin!
M	YURI	Zultan!
M	ZULTAN	Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would not see you.
M	COACH	He needs to concentrate now, Mister Karpov.
M	YURI	You shut up... when I talk to my boy, understand?
M	COACH	Yes, Mr. Karpov.
M	YURI	Good... That is good. Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are fighters. We never go down. We always stay on our feet...
M	YURI (CONT'D)	... No matter who is hitting us. No matter how hard.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	Now, go kill the bastard.
F	TAMARA	Yuri bear... where are you going?
M	PUBLIC RADIO NEWS (O.S.)	... Caltech believes that the incident in the Westwood supermarket has released most of the surface tension...
M	PUBLIC RADIO NEWS (O.S.)	... It looks like life in the city will soon be back to normal, Mayor Gonzales said at an early morning news conference from his home in Hancock Park.
F	JACKSON	Lilly, we're home sweetie. Wake up big man.
F	KATE	Oh honey, I'm so glad you're back... And you too, darling.
F	JACKSON	We tried calling but -
M	LILLY (O.S.)	I'm hungry Mummy.
F	KATE	At least it looks like the Mosquitos ate well.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Wanna come in?
M	YURI (O.S.)	Where are you Curtis?
M	JACKSON (O.S.)	Back in Westwood, Mister Karpov.
M	YURI	Good. That is good. I'm sending the Gulfstream to pick up Alec and Oleg.
F	TAMARA	Tell him to bring Caesar's raincoat, it's in the Range Rover.
M	YURI (O.S.)	Curtis, make sure you get my boys as fast you can.
M	ALEC	Curtis, you are late.
M	OLEG	Careful with our stuff. Don't get it dirty.
M	PREACHER	... There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord.
M	ALEC	Curtis, can't you go faster?
F	JACKSON	Are you guys blind? I can't run people over.
M	OLEG	Why not? They're idiots anyway.
M	SASHA	Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
M	ALEC	Ouch! Be more careful!
M	OLEG	Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are going on a big ship. We will live... and you will die.
F	JACKSON	Where can I rent a plane?
M	GOVERNOR	... just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare...
F	JACKSON	... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five.
F	KATE	The kids have plans today...
F	JACKSON	Are you kidding me!
F	KATE	No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate.
M	GORDON	Not that we'd expect him to remember.
F	JACKSON	California is going down! Pack up the kids!
F	KATE	You're crazy! The Governor just said we're fine now.
F	JACKSON	The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on.
F	LILLY	Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy?
F	LAURA	Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling.
M	GOVERNOR	... it looks to me, like the worst is over.
F	JACKSON	We have to leave! Noah, let's go!
F	KATE	I think we're safer here!
F	JACKSON	Noah, now! Kate please...
M	GORDON	I think he's right.
F	JACKSON	Get in the car!
M	NOAH	Holy shit!
F	JACKSON	Damn it! Where's the pilot?
F	KATE	Gordon, you know how to fly.
M	GORDON	I... had a couple lessons...
F	JACKSON	Did you cover taking off?
M	GORDON	Yeah.
F	JACKSON	That's good enough for me. Jackson, what are you doing?
F	JACKSON	I'm coming.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Come on, come on...
M	GORDON	But I'm supposed to check all these first...
M	NOAH	Guys, behind us!
M	EVERYBODY	Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
M	GORDON	I can't get it up!
M	NOAH	That was amazing, Gordon!
F	JACKSON	Are you okay?
F	KATE	I'm fine. How did you know this was gonna happen?
F	JACKSON	I didn't. Do we have enough fuel to make it to Yellowstone?
M	WAITER	You got fans Tony...
M	WAITER (CONT'D)	There's a call for you Harry. Want me to take a message?
M	HARRY	I'll be right there.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for the one and only Tony Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	Dad... what I have to tell you is very serious...
M	ADRIAN	You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	The President has ordered us to clear out the White House.
M	HARRY	Hah... About time someone cleaned up that mess.
M	ADRIAN	Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?...
M	HARRY (O.S.)	It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry about your old man. You have more important things to do now.
M	HARRY	You know, your mom and I, we had a hell of a great life... and a hell of a great kid too. And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship you know... Don't write your old man off, just yet.
M	HARRY (O.S.)	... Besides, I could never leave Tony alone. You know how he can't keep decent time by himself.
M	ADRIAN	I love you, dad.
M	HARRY	Love you too, son.
M	HARRY	Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the rocks.
M	TONY	After twenty-five years on the wagon?
M	HARRY	Why not? Who cares how long we do certain things? How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people... Or how long we don't talk to people.
M	TONY	Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with you? Let's go. We're back on.
M	HARRY	Call your kid, you stubborn old ass. I'm not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him.
M	WAITER	Tony, the ladies are waiting for you.
M	HARRY	Promise me, Tony... please.
M	TONY	Yeah, maybe I should call him...
M	NEWS ANCHOR	... There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of the Western seaboard was hit...
M	ADRIAN	Have you seen this?
M	PROF. WEST	We have satellite images. Here's the sequence we've got so far.
M	ADRIAN	Any news from Yellowstone?
M	PROF. WEST	Anytime now.
F	JACKSON	Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and I'll look for Charlie.
F	KATE	You're sure about this?
F	JACKSON	Kate, everything this guy said so far has happened. I'll be right back.
F	LILLY	Daddy wait! I wanna come with you!
F	KATE	Lilly! Come back!
F	JACKSON	It's fine! I'll take her.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	... I am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano...
F	JACKSON	He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...
F	LILLY	Let's go back, Daddy.
F	JACKSON	Listen to me. We have to find Charlie. He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Lil', we have to work as a team now, okay? You have to help me.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	... The last time this baby blew, was 640,000 years ago...
F	JACKSON	Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart. Hi mommy...
F	KATE	Where are you, honey!?
F	JACKSON	Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.
F	LILLY	We're looking for a secret map, mommy.
F	KATE	Let me speak to your daddy, darling.
M	LILLY (O.S.)	Daddy can't talk right now, he's driving really fast...
F	LILLY	Ouch! LILLY!
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	... I tell you guys, any minute now... any minute the fireworks will start...
M	KATE (O.S.)	Who's in the car with you? Who's that man screaming?
F	LILLY	He's not in the car. He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks.
M	LILLY (CONT'D)	There he is! Up there!
F	JACKSON	You're the best, darling. Give Daddy the phone... Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...
M	KATE (O.S.)	Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW!
F	JACKSON	You wait here for me! You watch the ship while Captain Curtis talks to the pirate. Okay?
F	LILLY	Okay...
M	CHARLIE FROST	... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV...
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	How did you make it up here? Thought you were toast.
F	JACKSON	The spaceships Charlie, where are they?
M	CHARLIE FROST	You can't make it there.
F	JACKSON	We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie!
M	CHARLIE FROST	You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid?
F	JACKSON	Where is that god damn map!
M	CHARLIE FROST	Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper.
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	Wow! Look at that!... Fly birdies fly! This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow...
M	CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)	... the last of mankind. Soon they'll see us from a million miles away, out there in the milky way...
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	... The ash cloud will travel everywhere. First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St. Louis and then Washington DC...
F	JACKSON	We're on our way.
F	KATE	Jackson, things are really looking bad here!
M	CHARLIE FROST	... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful!
F	LILLY	It's following us!
F	JACKSON	Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Majestic!... Oh yeah!
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Oh baby! It's coming!
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	`This is the end, my friend'...
M	CHARLIE FROST	... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie.
F	JACKSON	LILLY! DOWN!
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost there! Just keep looking at daddy.
F	LILLY	Mommy!
F	JACKSON	Stay down darling.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	You guys go! I'll be right there!
M	NOAH	Give me your hand, Lil'.
M	GORDON	We have to take off!
M	NOAH	No!
F	LILLY	Where's daddy?!
M	GORDON	Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die!
F	KATE	Gordon! Wait! JACKSON! NO!
F	LILLY	It's daddy!
F	KATE	Jackson! Here!
M	NOAH	Faster Dad. You can make it!
M	GORDON	Kate, grab him for god sake. We're almost out of runway.
F	JACKSON	Thanks for waiting guys.
F	KATE	So, now that you got your map, where are we going?
F	JACKSON	We're gonna need a bigger plane.
M	ADRIAN	Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds...
M	ANHEUSER	And the crustal displacement?
M	ADRIAN	No one knows, sir.
M	ANHEUSER	Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now.
M	ANHEUSER	Where is the President, Sally?
F	SALLY	He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone. I think he's over at the chapel.
M	ANHEUSER	The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church!
M	ADRIAN	He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea.
M	ANHEUSER	Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
F	SALLY	I really don't like that man.
M	ADRIAN	Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk. Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made.
M	ADRIAN	That's not your fault sir.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	You sound like Anheuser.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady?
M	ADRIAN	A little.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital? `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done.
M	ADRIAN	There would have been chaos, sir.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser.
M	ADRIAN	But sir?
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Go. That's an order Helmsley.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)	Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her.
M	GORDON	I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies.
F	KATE	Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
F	JACKSON	You don't understand, it's our only chance.
M	GORDON	This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China?
M	NOAH	Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California.
M	YURI (O.S.)	Careful with the landing gear! Tamara, get the boys out of the way!
M	VOICE	Attention! The US National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas.
M	VOICE (CONT'D)	We strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately...
M	FIRE MAN	Let's move people! Inside the terminal!
M	ADRIAN	Where's Anheuser?
M	OFFICER	In the command center, sir.
M	ADRIAN	The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to.
M	ANHEUSER	So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship? Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.
M	ADRIAN	What about the Speaker of the House?
M	ANHEUSER	In this chaos... I have no idea!
M	ADRIAN	But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think -
M	ANHEUSER	I don't care what you think, Helmsley.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady... and because of all that affirmative action bullshit.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	There was a white kid, much more qualified than you. Just so you know.
M	LAURA (O.S.)	Where is my father?
M	ADRIAN	He wanted to stay with his people.
F	LAURA	We have to go back!
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the Captain.
M	ANHEUSER	There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	Tell the Captain, to take off immediately.
M	RESCUE WORKER	People, stay away from the windows!
F	JACKSON	We can't get stuck here. Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here?
M	GORDON	She's a patient, honey.
F	JACKSON	Nice work.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	You bastard. You knew it all along! You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours...
M	SASHA	I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them.
M	YURI	Can you still fly that thing?
M	SASHA	Sure... But I need a copilot.
F	LILLY	Gordon is a pilot.
F	JACKSON	Let's go!
M	RESCUE WORKER	Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back!
M	NOAH	Wow, that is a big plane.
M	YURI	It's Russian.
M	SASHA	Guys, follow me!
M	SASHA	You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold...
M	SASHA (O.S.)	... Sit down and buckle up!
M	NOAH	Wow! Look at those!
M	YURI	We had VIP tickets for that.
M	SASHA	You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.
M	GORDON	Uh... What?
M	SASHA	Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay?
M	RESCUE WORKER	Move back, people... down on the floor!
M	GORDON	We have to get going!
M	SASHA	We're going, we're going.
M	GORDON	We're not gonna make it!
M	SASHA	Shut up! We will!
M	SASHA	GOVNO! (shit). Help me pull!
M	GORDON	Was that the Eiffel Tower?
M	SASHA	Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China.
M	LAMA YAK LA	Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it, Neng.
M	NENG	But Lin is my brother. He is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made.
M	NENG (CONT'D)	What is in your wisdom for us to do, great Lama... if Lin is right, if our world is indeed coming to an end?
M	NENG (CONT'D)	It's full, great Lama. It can hold no more!
M	LAMA YAK LA	Like this cup, Neng, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you wisdom unless you first empty your cup?
M	LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D)	Be careful with the clutch. It tends to slide.
M	MRS. PANG	Bata! Neng is coming!
M	NENG	Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on.
M	MRS. PANG	I thought Lin is working on the dam?
M	NENG	The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood.
M	MRS. PANG	Not here in the mountains... Let's eat first.
M	NENG	No mother! We must pack up right away.
M	NENG'S MOTHER	We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way.
M	MR. PANG	Neng, I did not know you were coming for dinner.
M	OLEG (O.S.)	Look, the new Bentley.
M	ALEC	Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year.
M	OLEG	But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships.
M	NOAH	If I was rich, I'd get one of those.
M	OLEG	We have one. How many cars does your family have?
M	NOAH	My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4.
M	ALEC	Our parents are divorced too.
M	NOAH	Nothing we can do about that.
M	NOAH (CONT'D)	Wow... look at this.
M	KATE (O.S.)	Be careful, Noh'!
F	TAMARA	How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he?
F	KATE	I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids...
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Did your husband ask you to get your's done?
F	TAMARA	We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them.
F	KATE	I bet he did.
F	LILLY	What did the man pay for mommy?
F	KATE	Nothing, Lil'bee.
F	TAMARA	What's your situation?
F	KATE	Way too complicated...
M	YURI	They seem to like each other.
F	JACKSON	I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay?
M	YURI	One billion euro, per seat.
F	JACKSON	That's disgusting.
M	YURI	You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach... ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	What would you have done, if you rich like me? Just look at your gorgeous kids. And call me Yuri...
M	SASHA (O.S.)	Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I will do the rest.
M	GORDON	Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying.
M	SASHA	Why did you give up?
M	GORDON	It didn't work.
M	GORDON (CONT'D)	What about the wheels we lost at take- off?
M	SASHA	There's 14 on each side. Some of them must still be there.
M	SASHA (O.S.)	Still nothing from the tower?
M	GORDON	Guys, you really oughta take a look at this.
M	YURI	What is that?
M	SASHA	The State of Hawaii!
M	YURI	Not good. That is not good.
F	JACKSON	How much fuel do we have?
M	SASHA	Not enough. We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea.
M	GORDON	At least we won't need our landing gear.
M	YURI	What about it?
M	GORDON	We lost it all... in Vegas.
M	ADRIAN	Can I come in?
F	LAURA	I've got nothing to say to you.
M	ADRIAN	But I do...
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Your Dad and I... we were trying to protect you.
F	LAURA	I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need protection. You used me. You guys had me gallivanting around the world, as part of your little cover-up.
M	ADRIAN	But you were doing a good job.
F	LAURA	Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso. But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough. People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God.
M	ADRIAN	You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself.
F	LAURA	That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive.
M	ADRIAN	That's not true. What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane?
F	LAURA	Zero. What's your point?
M	ADRIAN	It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.
M	INTERCOM (O.S.)	Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your presence immediately.
M	ADRIAN	What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me...
F	LAURA	I need to know that too, Adrian.
M	ADRIAN	One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too.
M	OLD LADY	She can't find her mother.
M	PRESIDENT	Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross...
M	OLD LADY	No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley.
F	SALLY	I know, she was amazing.
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Who can help me with missing persons?
M	RED CROSS VOLUNTEER	Sorry man, I'm busy right now.
M	RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D)	I mean, of course sir. I didn't realize... What can I do for you, Mr. President?
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son...
M	SCIENCE OFFICER	The capitol was hit by a 9.4.
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	We lost communication with the White House, sir.
M	LIEUTENANT #2	President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space.
M	ANHEUSER	That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action...
M	NENG	Hold on back there!
F	JACKSON	Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither.
F	KATE	Anything?
F	JACKSON	Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal.
F	KATE	I can't think about what's going on down there.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I wanted to thank you. For coming back for us.
F	JACKSON	I couldn't have left you...
F	KATE	Do you think people change?
F	JACKSON	By `people' are we talking about me?
F	KATE	Do you think you've changed since we separated?
F	JACKSON	Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now...
F	KATE	You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson.
F	JACKSON	Do you love him? Gordon...
F	KATE	I love him enough.
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	... Cho Ming reports the first tremors, however none higher than 5.0.
M	SCIENCE OFFICER #1	The crust has begun to shift, Prof. West.
M	PROF. WEST	By what degree?
M	SCIENCE OFFICER #1	1.2 percent, but still moving.
M	ANHEUSER	Any clue what to expect next, Professor? Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir... proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes.
M	ADRIAN	Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard?
M	SCIENCE OFFICER #2	We've recorded two quakes averaging
M	NEWSCASTER	... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water...
M	TONY	I called... But I never got through.
M	HARRY	I'm so sorry.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	Tony!!
M	PRESIDENT WILSON	I'm coming home Dorothy...
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #1	All global ground communication has ceased sir.
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #2	The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming.
M	ANHEUSER	At least some good news. Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment?
M	ADRIAN	We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. ... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... ... These are their new positions.
M	ANHEUSER	So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?
M	ADRIAN	It's the south pole, sir.
M	YURI (O.S.)	What's that?
M	SASHA	Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready.
F	JACKSON	Let's go wake up the kids.
M	NOAH (O.S.)	Why do you hate Gordon?
F	JACKSON	What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon.
M	NOAH	But you don't like him either.
F	JACKSON	I don't know him that well.
M	NOAH	But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well.
F	JACKSON	I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise.
F	KATE	Is it time?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to land.
M	NOAH	What's wrong?
F	JACKSON	Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet.
F	JACKSON	Your daddy has to tell you something.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both...
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	... And I am so very sorry for that. Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys should come back up here.
M	SASHA	Don't ask me how that happened.
M	SASHA (CONT'D)	There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go.
M	GORDON	It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles...
F	JACKSON	No shit. It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Way to go Charlie!
M	SASHA	We lost our last two engines.
M	SASHA (CONT'D)	I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the brake fluids. It's going to get rocky... There, the blue levers!
M	SASHA (CONT'D)	Listen up guys! This may sound a little crazy, but here's what you got to do...
M	YURI	Get up! Follow me!
F	TAMARA	Yuri bear, what are we doing?
M	YURI	We're taking the Bentley! CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast!
M	SASHA (CONT'D)	Now! Open it!
M	YURI	SHUT UP EVERY ONE! Engine... start...
M	YURI (CONT'D)	Voice control... Sold me on it.
M	SASHA	Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down!
M	GORDON	What about you?!
M	SASHA	I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! What are you waiting for!
M	YURI (O.S.)	Push it Curtis!
F	JACKSON	We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.
M	NOAH	Tamara! Open the door!
F	TAMARA	Where's Sasha?
M	GORDON	He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down.
F	LILLY	Daaadddy!
M	JACKSON (O.S.)	Everybody okay back there?
M	KATE (O.S.)	We're all fine.
M	CHINESE COMMANDER	Welcome to the People's Republic of China.
F	JACKSON	Thank you... Say thank you, kids.
M	CHINESE COMMANDER	What color are your passes?
M	CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D)	What color are your boarding passes?
M	YURI (O.S.)	I have green card.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	For my boys and me.
F	TAMARA	It's a joke... a mistake... Right Yuri?
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	You disgust me. You pig.
M	YURI	You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys!
M	GORDON	What!... Did that just happen!?
M	CHINESE OFFICER	Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you!
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father...
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)	Your party is the last to arrive.
M	ANHEUSER	I've been told of damages?
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)	There it is!
M	YURI	What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor.
M	SOLDIER	I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements.
M	YURI	I want your name!
M	SOLDIER	Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained.
F	JACKSON	Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great.
F	TAMARA	I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it.
M	GORDON	Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments?
F	TAMARA	Cheap bastard.
M	GORDON	You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?
F	TAMARA	Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri.
F	JACKSON	You guys hear that?
F	JACKSON	Hey! Help! Wait for us!
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	Shit! Shit!
F	LAURA	Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people?
M	ANHEUSER	Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	Captain? Where is the Bridge?
M	CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.)	Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.
M	ADRIAN	Satnam? Where are you? On the Nampan Plateau...
M	ADRIAN	What?!
M	SATNAM	There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge!
M	ADRIAN	Satnam, what happened?
M	SATNAM (O.S.)	We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came!
M	SATNAM	I have to go!
M	ADRIAN	Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India?
M	SCIENCE OFFICER	One moment, sir.
M	ANHEUSER	Helmsley, what's going on here?
M	ADRIAN	Looks like our model was wrong.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Satnam was talking about a wave from the East.
M	PROF. WEST	Jesus!
M	ANHEUSER	What does this mean?
M	ADRIAN	The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please?
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Satnam didn't get picked up.
M	SCIENCE OFFICER (O.S.)	Ready sir.
M	ADRIAN	This one is at least 1500 meters high!
M	ANHEUSER	Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us?
M	ADRIAN	Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down?
M	ANHEUSER	Get me the other Heads of State.
M	LIN	Who are they?
M	NENG	We found them by the side of the road, my brother.
M	LIN	You must send them back.
M	NENG	I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that.
F	JACKSON	Come with daddy.
M	JACKSON (CONT'D)	At least take our children with you. Please.
M	LIN	Why should I do that?
F	JACKSON	For the same reason you sent for your parents.
F	KATE	I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you!
M	MRS. PANG	We are all children of this earth.
M	LIN	My plan will not work for so many, mother.
M	MRS. PANG	We will take them all. Bata?
F	KATE	Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
M	YURI	They're leaving without us!
M	SOLDIER	What did I tell you!
M	YURI	Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too!
M	LIN	We have to hurry! They launch! We run out of time!
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds.
F	LAURA	Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?
M	SCIENCE OFFICER	He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me.
M	LIN	Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand.
F	JACKSON	Move Lil'bee!
F	TAMARA	Oh my god, that's Yuri!
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	Caesar!
M	YURI	Let that stupid dog go!
M	LIN	Okay. Now!
F	JACKSON	Tamara! Come on! Get in!
M	YURI	Down there! Oleg, you go first!
M	OLEG	Daddy look, Tamara!
F	TAMARA	Caesar darling!
F	JACKSON	Tamara! Get in!
F	TAMARA	Come to mommy!
M	LIN	I need your help.
F	LAURA	What in god's name is happening Adrian?
M	ADRIAN	Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
M	ADRIAN	Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this.
M	ANHEUSER	What do you think you're doing?
M	ADRIAN	I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on!
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson...
M	GERMAN CHANCELLOR	Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann?
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization...
M	ADRIAN	... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. Or at least I don't want to be part of it.
M	ANHEUSER	We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	That's an order soldier.
M	ADRIAN	Don't do it!
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them.
M	ANHEUSER	Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?!
M	ADRIAN	There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why?
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	He died because we forgot to pick him up. I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children?
F	LAURA	If my father were here, he would open the gates.
M	RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.)	The people of Russia along with...
M	RUSSIAN PRESIDENT	... China and Japan agree to open the gates.
M	GERMAN CHANCELLOR	The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister...
M	GERMAN CHANCELLOR (O.S.)	... We vote to open the gates.
M	ADRIAN	Captain Michaels, you heard them.
F	LILLY	Phew... It stinks in here.
F	TAMARA	Sssh...Caesar.
M	LIN	They're opening the gate! It will crush us!
F	JACKSON	Noah! Watch out!
F	KATE	No!
M	NOAH	Something happened, mom.
F	JACKSON	We have to stop it!
F	JACKSON	You did it, man. You did it.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	What's wrong with the gate?
M	OFFICER	I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir.
M	SURVEILLANCE OFFICER	Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay.
M	ADRIAN	Can you zoom in?
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	We're loaded. We can close the gates sir.
M	ANHEUSER	Do it!
M	YURI	Pull yourself up!
M	DECK OFFICER (O.S.)	To the lower decks people!
M	YURI	Oleg! Catch your brother!
M	DECK OFFICER	Boys, you gotta move.
M	ALEC	We wait for our father! He's still down there!
M	DECK OFFICER	There's no one down there. Come on boys, come...
M	ANHEUSER	Why is the stern gate not closing?
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. Captain, over here.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	I think we found the problem.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	How did they get in there?
M	SURVEILLANCE OFFICER	They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There...
F	LAURA	That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong.
M	ANHEUSER	You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean...
M	ADRIAN	Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber.
M	ANHEUSER	You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter?
M	ADRIAN	What are you all waiting for?
M	TECHNICAL OFFICER	If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start.
M	ADRIAN	There's no way to override it?
M	TECHNICAL OFFICER	No sir, it has to be done manually.
M	NENG	Almost there, Lin...
M	SURVEILLANCE OFFICER	Water has penetrated the stern!
F	LAURA	What now?
M	SURVEILLANCE OFFICER	The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time.
M	ADRIAN	Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber?
M	SURVEILLANCE OFFICER	If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.
F	KATE	Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I was so worried about you.
F	LILLY	Mummy!
F	TAMARA	Lilly run!
M	TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D)	Lilly! Take him.
M	ADRIAN	Is there any way to talk to them?
F	JACKSON	We have to move him higher. Over there!
M	NAVAL OFFICER	Moving at 34 knots, sir.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	What is our position?
M	NAVIGATION OFFICER	Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	You must be kidding!
F	KATE	We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die.
M	NOAH	Mum, will this do?
M	ADRIAN	Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me.
F	KATE	Lilly!
F	LILLY	I'm alright Mom!
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it.
M	ADRIAN	You're our only hope.
F	JACKSON	I'll go back. I'll try my best.
M	NOAH	I'll go with you.
F	JACKSON	You stay with Mommy. I'll be right back...
M	ANHEUSER	Captain, what's happening?
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	What's happening?... We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.
F	KATE	Noah!
M	NOAH	Mom, we did it!
M	NOAH (O.S.)	We got it free. Can you hear me? We did it!
M	ADRIAN	Captain Michaels - close the gate!
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	That's affirmative. Close the gate!
M	TECHNICAL OFFICER	Ay, ay, Sir.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	Engage starboard stabilizers!
M	OFFICERS	One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir!
F	KATE	Noah! Where is he?
M	NOAH	He was just behind me...
F	JACKSON	If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me.
F	KATE	Whatever you do... I will never let you go again. We hear a voice. ... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen...
M	ADRIAN	... and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. The end.
F	LAURA	How many copies did you say that sold?
M	ADRIAN	Less than 500. It's what you might call a cult classic.
F	LAURA	It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley?
M	ADRIAN	Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements.
F	LAURA	Actually my diary's pretty open.
M	OFFICER (O.S.)	Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)	Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I will be giving the orders to unseal the decks.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)	Please be careful when you step out and of course... enjoy the fresh air.
F	LILLY	Daddy? When can we go back home?
F	JACKSON	There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared.
F	LILLY	I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.
F	JACKSON	That's my big girl.
M	OLEG (O.S.)	Can we pet him?
F	LILLY	Of course you can. He's your doggie.
M	ADRIAN	You called for me, sir?
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)	Looks like your scientific projections are way off again.
M	PROF. WEST	The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian...
F	LAURA	What's that?
M	PROF. WEST	It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	Our European colleagues have already set course for it.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)	Here, somebody wants to talk to you.
M	ADRIAN	This is Helmsley.
M	VOICE	No, this is Helmsley.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	Dad!... Is that you?
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS	We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly.
M	ADRIAN	Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony?
M	HARRY HELMSLEY	He's fine, son. We're all fine. See you guys soon. Bye dad.
M	ANHEUSER (O.S.)	Put that woman down Helmsley.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world...
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.
M	ANHEUSER (CONT'D)	There was no one.
M	ADRIAN	Pardon me?
M	ANHEUSER	There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that.
M	CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)	This is your Captain speaking. Standby to open Deck 1.
M	OFFICER	Standing by Sir.
M	MRS. PANG	I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars?
M	MR.PANG	Do not fear. Some things will never change.
F	JACKSON	I thought you might want this.
M	NOAH	Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad?
M	ADRIAN	I finally finished your book Jackson.
F	KATE	Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end.
F	JACKSON	Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think?
M	ADRIAN	I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole.
