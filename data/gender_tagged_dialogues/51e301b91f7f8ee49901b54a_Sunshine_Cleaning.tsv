M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	OWNER	I've got the five stores here and then two in Rio Rancho. CONTINUED: 4 That's fantastic. See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf.
M	OWNER	Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order.
M	OWNER	How about I give you a call if I decide to--
M	JOE	I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.
M	OWNER	Yeah, tomorrow's not good.
M	JOE	Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break.
M	JOE	My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this...
M	JOE	Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather? CONTINUED: (2) 4
F	MR. KIM	You are fired.
F	NORAH	I so don't care.
F	NORAH	Fuck.
M	CARL	Yep, these shotgun cases are a real pain in the ass. What we call a wide field of contamination. Guy's all over the place and every little glob of him's a biohazard.
M	CARL	Gonna lose some inventory.
M	OWNER	Selfish bastard.
M	CARL	Trust me, you do not want some lady suing you cuz she found this guy's tooth in her brand new fanny pack.
M	CLEAN SWEEP WORKER	He's over here in fishing too.
M	CARL	Yep, a real pain in the ass.
F	MAC	We're wrapping it up.
M	OWNER	Three grand just to have the asshole wiped up off the floor. Can you believe that?
F	MAC	Hey, can you handle the report tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do.
M	DETECTIVE	A blonde thing or a brunette thing? CONTINUED: 12
F	ROSE	I am strong. I am powerful. I can do anything. I am a winner.
F	NORAH	The fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means I'm under no obligation to blow you.
M	RANDY	I think you're scared of it.
F	NORAH	I'm not scared of it.
M	RANDY	Uncomfortable then. You just need to get better acquainted.
F	NORAH	Dad, get the phone.
M	RANDY	There's absolutely no pressure here. CONTINUED: 13
M	RANDY	You can touch it if you want.
F	NORAH	Hello.
M	ROSE (O.S.)	You haven't left yet? Damn it Norah, my class starts in fifteen minutes.
F	NORAH	I know, I know. Doesn't Rose have her thing * tonight? * I'm going. I need to borrow your * car. *
M	JOE *	Here. Take some corn. *
M	RANDY *	I'm really nuts about your * daughter, Mr. Lorkowski. * CONTINUED: 14 That's nice. Give me a hand with * this. *
M	RANDY *	I see they sold that house across * the street. I bet they'll come * knocking on your door soon. *
M	JOE *	They can knock all they want. Wait, * wait, whaddaya doing? Don't put the * lime sticker on the cheddar can. * Maybe I better just do this myself. * CONTINUED: (2) 14
F	NORAH	Sorry.
F	ROSE	I'm gonna be so late.
F	NORAH	I brought fancy corn!
F	ROSE	How can you eat that stuff?
F	ROSE	He'll be hyper all night.
F	ROSE	Be good. CONTINUED: 16
F	ROSE	And no lobsterman stories. He had nightmares all week. Just use some common sense.
F	NORAH	You're welcome.
F	ROSE	You want me?
F	MAC	Yeah... baby... I want... Oh...
F	NORAH	He's slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there... somewhere... coming for him. And he's totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox.
M	OSCAR	Why did he lick the mailbox?
F	NORAH	I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes.
M	OSCAR	Why wasn't he in school? CONTINUED: 18 Are you gonna let me tell the story?
F	NORAH	An then, he hears a horrible sound. Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag. Lobsterman is coming.
M	OSCAR	Maybe he didn't go to school because he had the ACD.
M	OSCAR	Sorry.
F	NORAH	He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws.
F	ROSE	Still sore?
F	ROSE	I don't know why you did that.
F	MAC	You should hear the way he goes on about his lean body mass index bullshit. Drinking that antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme crap all the time. CONTINUED: 19
F	ROSE	When was the last time you even played basketball?
F	MAC	He needed to be brought down a peg or two.
F	ROSE	I'm sure you pulling a groin muscle humbled him.
F	MAC	I should introduce him to your sister.
F	ROSE	Norah and a cop? That would happen.
F	MAC	We were working a scene today where this guy offs himself in a sporting goods store. So they had this cleaning crew out there, right? You would not believe how much money they charge for that shit. It's ridiculous.
F	ROSE	With the dead body there?
F	MAC	Naw, the body's gone, it's just the blood and stuff.
F	ROSE	Sounds horrible.
F	MAC	You ask me it's a racket. You should get into that. CONTINUED: (2) 19
F	ROSE	You think that's all I can do? Clean other people's shit?
F	MAC	Come here.
F	MAC	You know that's not what I think.
F	ROSE	I am gonna be a real estate agent.
F	MAC	I know. With business cards.
F	NORAH	It's about time. I thought your class got over at 9:30.
F	ROSE	Why isn't he in bed?
F	NORAH	Said he was scared. I think he was fakin' it though.
F	NORAH	I'm not taking money.
F	ROSE	It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad told me about you getting fired. CONTINUED: 20
F	ROSE	What happened?
F	NORAH	Nothing.
F	ROSE	What, were you stoned or something?
F	NORAH	It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head.
F	ROSE	I thought you liked Mr. Kim.
F	NORAH	Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God.
F	ROSE	When are you going to grow up and start taking responsibility for--
F	NORAH	Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody.
F	ROSE	Shut up and take the ten.
F	NORAH	There was a diner scene earlier. With a waitress.
F	ROSE	Any pie?
F	NORAH	Completely pie free.
M	MOLLY MAID	The lady's here.
F	ROSE	We're all finished. Since it's our first visit we did the blinds and appliances but normally we'll alternate those weekly. Nobody mentioned anything to us about laundry so we didn't bother with that but if you want laundry included there is an extra...
F	PAULA	Rose? Rose Lorkowski?
F	PAULA	It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading squad junior year.
F	ROSE	Paula Datzman. Wow.
F	ROSE	How are you?
F	PAULA	Great! I'm Paula Datzman-Mead now. CONTINUED: 22
F	ROSE	Congratulations.
F	PAULA	Thanks. We're expecting our second in a couple of months.
F	PAULA	How are you? You look just the same.
F	ROSE	I'm good. Really good!
F	PAULA	God, I always envied you so much. Head cheerleader... dating the quarterback... So did you and Mac end up getting married?
F	ROSE	Nope. No. I'm not sure...I think he ended up marrying Heather Volkman.
F	PAULA	Wow. Well it's so good to see you. Let me get your info so I can send you an invite to the baby shower.
F	PAULA	It'll be like a big reunion. The whole gang from high school will be there.
F	PAULA	So what are you doing now?
F	ROSE	I... I've just gotten my real estate license, and so... CONTINUED: (2) 22
F	PAULA	Real estate?
F	ROSE	Yeah, this... this is just kind of a temporary thing and I'm about to just really phase over into the real estate full time.
F	PAULA	You're kidding, I'm in real estate!
F	PAULA	With Long and Foster. Who are you with?
F	ROSE	Me? Um. You know, I haven't really decided yet. I might check out Long and Foster.
F	PAULA	Maybe you'll just be independent.
F	ROSE	Yeah. Maybe.
F	PAULA	What was that about the laundry? CONTINUED: 23
F	ROSE	Hello.
M	COUNSELOR	It's not just this incident. There have been several episodes over the past year where Oscar has... has engaged in disruptive behavior.
M	COUNSELOR	There was the incident in gym class.
F	ROSE	I did pay the damages for that.
M	COUNSELOR	And the chalk thing.
M	COUNSELOR	And the time he locked Jeremy Johnston in the--
F	ROSE	Okay. What did he do this time?
M	COUNSELOR	Now it's... licking. CONTINUED: 25
M	TEACHER	I will not tolerate it. I will not tolerate that behavior in my classroom.
M	COUNSELOR	Oscar has started licking things in the classroom.
M	TEACHER	First it was the pencil sharpener. Then the aquarium.
M	COUNSELOR (O.S.)	It's unsanitary. And it's disturbing to the other children.
M	COUNSELOR	We think Oscar might benefit from an environment where he could receive more specialized attention.
M	TEACHER	He licked my leg.
M	JOE	Where'd you get those?
M	OSCAR	Up there.
M	JOE	Come here.
M	JOE	Those were your grandma's. She'd watch birds with those.
M	JOE	Hey, hey. Careful.
M	JOE	Why don't we put those away. CONTINUED: 28
M	OSCAR	Why can't I play with them?
M	JOE	Because it's not a toy. It's a scientific instrument.
M	JOE	You can play with them when I'm around to supervise.
M	OSCAR	You're around now.
M	JOE	I'm tired now.
F	ROSE	Well I'm not putting him in special ed. I'll figure out a way to put him in private school before I do that.
F	NORAH	Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school?
M	JOE	Who's going to private school?
F	ROSE	Nobody dad, we're just talking.
M	JOE	Oscar get suspended again? CONTINUED: 29
M	JOE	The kid's a little strange. What? That's against the law now? It's not like he's out killing kittens or any damn thing. I swear everyone's so damn uptight these days.
F	MAC	Hello.
F	ROSE	Mac, it's me.
F	MAC	What are you doing calling here?
F	ROSE	I know, I'm sorry.
F	MAC	Heather could have easily--
F	ROSE	I thought she had yoga on Saturdays.
F	MAC	Still, it's not cool. CONTINUED:
F	ROSE	I know, I'm sorry. I just needed to ask you... you know the other day... you said that... about the specialized cleaning guys making so much money...
M	ROSE (O.S.)	Are you even listening?
F	NORAH	No thanks.
F	ROSE	What do you mean `no thanks'? What else do you have to do? You don't have a job. You don't go to school. What, are you going to live with Dad the rest of your life?
F	NORAH	I don't think you're in any position to feel superior. CONTINUED: 31
M	JOE	Girls, come on. Lets have a nice dinner.
F	ROSE	It's just until I get my real estate license.
M	OSCAR	I want to have my birthday at Hinkle's.
M	JOE	The hell with Hinkle's, I'm taking us to Disney Land!
F	ROSE	Dad don't.
M	OSCAR	Why? I think Disney Land is a great idea!
M	JOE	Yeah, what's wrong with Disney Land? And I think it'd be great if you girls worked together.
F	NORAH	You are so out of touch.
M	SUPER	Some sorta domestic disturbance kind of a deal. It was the lady who got the last word I guess. Course she's in jail now, so... Heard one bullet completely shot off his ring finger. How long you gals been doin' this kind a work? CONTINUED: 32
F	ROSE	A while. CONTINUED: (2) 32
M	SUPER	You know Mac pretty well?
M	SUPER	Just swing by the office when you're done and we'll settle up.
M	ROSE (O.S.)	Found it.
F	NORAH	Think they loved each other?
F	ROSE	Yeah. CONTINUED: 35
M	SUPER	You gals did a real nice job.
M	BARTENDER	Hey Joe, what you got for me?
M	JOE	World's finest corn snack. CONTINUED: 40
M	BARTENDER	See where old Miller's house sold?
M	REGULAR	Bet you could get a chunk of change for your place. You should cash out now before the market turns sour.
M	JOE	I'm not selling my house. No way. I don't care how much those idiots would shell out for it. I got history in that house. You think they understand about history?
M	REGULAR	Still... How much commission you get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta sell a lot of corn to-
M	JOE	Hey, the corn's good. Really good. Not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon.
M	JOE	It'll get there. Takes time to get to know the market. Develop a relationship with the buyers. But it'll get there. Who doesn't like popcorn for Christ's sake.
M	REGULAR	My brother-in-law's in sales.
M	REGULAR	Last year he buys a cow.
M	JOE	Why would you buy a cow? CONTINUED: (2) 40
M	REGULAR	Not a live cow. A whole butchered cow from a rancher. On the hoof they call it.
M	JOE	Mm hmm.
M	REGULAR	He sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants. Direct. Made a killing.
M	JOE	What'd he do with the brains and intestines?
M	JOE	So he cuts out the middle man. Not a bad idea.
M	JOE	Course it'd be smarter to do that with something that didn't have bad parts. Like... shrimp.
M	JOE	Rose is on the phone. Norah?
F	NORAH	I'm sleeping. CONTINUED: 42
M	JOE	She says it's important.
F	NORAH	What do you want?
F	ROSE	Mac got us another gig.
F	NORAH	I'm sleeping.
F	ROSE	I'll pick you up in an hour.
F	NORAH	No.
F	NORAH	You suck.
F	ROSE	Money.
F	NORAH	You still suck.
F	ROSE	Apparently some crazy bag lady squatter person died and--
F	NORAH	You didn't get me coffee?
F	ROSE	I didn't know you wanted any.
F	NORAH	Of course I... CONTINUED: 44
F	NORAH	How long is this gonna take?
F	ROSE	All we have to do is go in and throw everything away. Cake.
F	ROSE	Great, now we're gonna have to clean that up too.
F	ROSE	Where are you going?
F	NORAH	There is no way. CONTINUED: 47
F	ROSE	You said you would help me. CONTINUED: (2) 47
F	NORAH	Maybe if you'd gotten me a coffee.
F	NORAH	I'm standing here.
F	NORAH	What do we do with that? CONTINUED: 50
F	ROSE	Dumpster?
M	MANAGER	You're telling me this Fancy Corn stuff is some kind of health food?
M	JOE	Well, it's a candy... and a health food. Absolutely. Absolutely.
M	MANAGER	Yeah, I don't know. We don't have much more shelf space.
M	JOE	Glycerol monostearate? What is that? I can't even read that.
M	JOE	Read that.
M	MANAGER	High fructose--
M	JOE	No. The first thing listed. The number one ingredient. CONTINUED: 52
M	MANAGER	Corn.
M	JOE	Exactly. Corn. Can you think of anything more wholesome? It's all American for Christ's sake.
M	OSCAR	Do you know if they sell fancy corn here?
M	OSCAR	Do you even know what fancy corn is?
M	GIRL	Yes.
M	OSCAR	Well, do they sell it here?
M	GIRL	I dunno.
M	OSCAR	I heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength.
M	GIRL	That's stupid.
M	OSCAR	It's true. Some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. If you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength.
M	GIRL	I don't believe you.
M	OSCAR	I don't care if you do or not. CONTINUED: (2) 52
M	JOE	I read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! You think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? No way. More and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now.
M	MANAGER	Like I said, I already put in all the orders I want for this year.
M	GIRL'S MOTHER	Excuse me. Do you carry something called fancy corn? CONTINUED: (3) 52
F	NORAH	It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away.
F	NORAH	I bet this is her.
F	NORAH	Wow, look at this.
F	NORAH	Think it's her daughter?
F	NORAH	Shouldn't we do something? Try to find her or something?
F	ROSE	That's none of your business, Norah. CONTINUED: 53
F	ROSE	Hand me that.
F	NORAH	What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't you want to know if this was mom?
F	ROSE	Mom was never like this. Mom would never have been like this.
F	NORAH	I wonder how she died?
F	ROSE	Damnit Norah, we still have a lot of shit to do here. Are you just gonna talk?
M	JOE	That was real good. You're a natural. You got the timing, you got the nerve. You're a real sharp cookie, you know that?
M	OSCAR	No I'm not. I'm stupid.
M	JOE	You're not stupid. What are you saying? You're not stupid. CONTINUED: 54
M	OSCAR	Yes I am. They want to put me in retard classes.
M	JOE	Don't say that.
M	OSCAR	What?
M	JOE	It's those teachers who are retarded. You're probably just too advanced for those classes. You're bored. Do you get bored in class?
M	OSCAR	Yeah.
M	JOE	See. You're too smart! And those teachers just don't know how to handle you. You're probably a goddamn genius.
M	OSCAR	You think so?
M	JOE	I know so!
F	ROSE	It was so disgusting. I mean the smell, you would not believe.
F	ROSE	There were flies everywhere and, really, the smell. I can't even describe it.
F	MAC	Shhhh.
F	ROSE	But, after we finished... you woulda never even known. We took all that away... made it right.
F	MAC	I can't believe you... I mean, I feel like I got you into this mess.
F	ROSE	No, I--
F	MAC	Listen, I'm gonna pay for new real estate classes. Okay?
F	MAC	We'll get you your license and then get you a little photo in the real estate section. You can drive people around all day and talk about... Gosh, what would you talk about? Crown molding?
F	ROSE	Oh yeah, definitely talk about crown molding.
F	ROSE	Property easements, square footage, appliances...
F	MAC	You're holding out on me.
F	ROSE	Freak.
F	MAC	Say it. Come on. One time.
F	ROSE	Curb appeal.
F	ROSE	Why'd you pick her? CONTINUED: (2) 58
F	MAC	You know it wasn't like that.
F	ROSE	How was it like?
F	MAC	Are you going to do that?
F	ROSE	No.
F	MAC	If this is going to get all heavy--
F	ROSE	No.
F	ROSE	Winston?
F	ROSE	I spoke with you on the phone. I'm Rose Lorkowski.
F	ROSE	So, our situation is...
F	ROSE	We're doing some postmortem kind of um... specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult...
F	NORAH	Smelly.
F	ROSE	Really smelly job where the lady had died and they didn't find her for a while and it was really...
F	NORAH	Stinky.
F	ROSE	The odor was really strong.
M	WINSTON	A decomp.
F	ROSE	Yeah, a decomp!
M	WINSTON	General purpose cleaners, extraction cleaners, odor control. We carry both the Winzyme and the DR 450. Disinfectants, stain removers and shampoos. Steamers, buffers, foggers, that kinda stuff's in there, for rent or purchase. Quick absorbing sawdust, good for vomit.
M	WINSTON	And you've got your personal protective gear back here.
M	CARL	You hear there're a couple of amateurs poaching jobs?
M	CARL	Bruce said they took a decomp for five hundred bucks. What do you wanna bet they threw all that shit right in the dumpster.
F	ROSE	Hey, I have that puzzle. It's a hard one. I think I got lost in the white and gave up.
M	WINSTON	Fifty-eight twenty-four. CONTINUED: 61
F	ROSE	You like cats?
F	NORAH	Great. You freaked him out.
F	ROSE	I asked him if he liked cats.
M	WINSTON	Bring these back.
F	NORAH	Turns out it's against the law to throw bio hazards in the dumpster. Who knew?
F	NORAH	How perfect was he with the one arm?
F	ROSE	Hmm?
F	NORAH	The creepy guy. Do you think he was born like that?
F	ROSE	I didn't think he was creepy.
F	NORAH	Dude, he has one arm.
F	ROSE	They think we're just a couple of hacks.
F	NORAH	We are a couple of hacks. CONTINUED: 62
F	NORAH	Stop here.
F	ROSE	Why?
F	NORAH	I gotta thing. Just drop me off here.
F	ROSE	I'll drop Oscar by around seven.
F	NORAH	You have class tonight?
F	ROSE	Mortgage lenders and financing.
F	NORAH	Heather's pregnant again. Did you know that? He's never going to leave her.
F	NORAH	God, you're pathetic.
F	LYNN	Who are you?
F	NORAH	What?
F	LYNN	Why are you following me?
F	NORAH	I'm not following you.
F	LYNN	You are following me!
F	LYNN	Aren't you?
F	LYNN	Oh no.
F	NORAH	What? CONTINUED: 67
F	LYNN	Shit! This is not happening.
F	LYNN	Listen, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought you were following me.
F	NORAH	That's all right.
F	LYNN	You think I'm crazy.
F	NORAH	No. No I don't.
F	LYNN	I'm not crazy.
F	NORAH	It was a mistake. No big deal.
F	LYNN	It's not moving.
F	NORAH	Let's press the alarm button.
F	LYNN	Go to the university?
F	NORAH	Me? No. CONTINUED: (2) 67
F	NORAH	Hobby...
F	NORAH	There's this gorilla who knows sign language and I've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. You know? To actually talk to a gorilla.
F	LYNN	I think I've seen something on--
F	NORAH	KoKo.
F	LYNN	Yeah, yeah, with the kitten.
F	NORAH	Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's fault. She was heartbroken.
F	LYNN	Kind of weird, don't you think? Teaching a gorilla to talk. Probably, gorillas aren't supposed to talk.
F	NORAH	That's what's so cool about it.
F	LYNN	I'm sorry again about the...
F	NORAH	No, don't... it's fine. CONTINUED: (3) 67
F	LYNN	You've got nice veins.
F	LYNN	You should give blood.
F	ROSE	Hi. Could you tell me what time you have? Okay. Thanks. CONTINUED: 71
F	ROSE	I am strong. I am powerful. I am a winner. I'm a fucking idiot.
M	JOE	You're back early.
F	ROSE	I'm quitting real estate.
M	JOE	What are you talking about? You can't quit real estate. You're gonna be great at real estate. You got the whole look and besides, that's where everything's headed. Hell, it's what I should have done forty years ago.
F	ROSE	Shut up.
M	OSCAR	Want me to make you something happy?
F	ROSE	Yeah. I'd like that.
M	JOE	Make me something happy too.
M	WINSTON	Sunshine Cleaning. Nice.
F	ROSE	Thought we'd put a positive spin on things. My son drew the design. CONTINUED: 73
M	WINSTON	That's a nice job you did there.
M	OSCAR	Where's your arm?
F	ROSE	Oscar!
M	WINSTON	That's all right.
F	ROSE	I was thinking maybe I could set a few out by the register?
M	WINSTON	Yeah sure.
M	WINSTON	This is great but you guys should really get out there and market yourselves.
M	WINSTON	Funeral Homes, property managers... What you really want is to get in with the insurance companies. They can throw you a ton of work. CONTINUED: 74
M	WINSTON	Do you guys have your B.B.P. certification?
F	ROSE	B.B. who?
M	WINSTON	Blood Born Pathogens. The big money jobs... they'll expect you to be certified. I can register you for the next seminar if you want.
F	ROSE	Did you ask him to come.
F	NORAH	Not exactly.
M	JOE	Now Sherm's gonna say he's against the wall but don't you believe him. There's always some wiggle room.
F	ROSE	I can handle it.
M	SHERM	I think you're gonna like this Econoline. CONTINUED: 76
M	JOE	The girls have started up their own specialized cleaning business. Crime scene and trauma clean-up.
F	ROSE	It's a real growth industry.
M	SHERM	Sounds kinda gory. CONTINUED: (2) 76
F	ROSE	Can be. Can be.
F	ROSE	We gotta take any contaminated materials to the incinerators. So we'll need lots of space back here.
M	OSCAR	For the bloody stuff.
F	ROSE	So, how much is this?
M	SHERM	Nineteen Ninety-nine.
M	JOE	What's the play on that?
M	SHERM	Oh, that's the floor right there. I'm actually taking a loss on this to make room for some new product.
F	ROSE	Well, I could pay cash.
M	SHERM	Cash is good.
M	JOE	Ask him about the bumper.
F	ROSE	What?
M	JOE	The dented bumper.
F	ROSE	I noticed the bumper's kind of banged up. CONTINUED: (3) 76
M	SHERM	Character.
M	JOE	We were over at Motor Mart on Lomas earlier. They got a nice looking Chevy G series for eighteen.
M	SHERM	Power steering?
M	OSCAR	What's that?
F	NORAH	Oh, excellent.
F	ROSE	God, do people even use those anymore?
M	OSCAR	What is it?
M	SHERM	It's a CB. You talk into this thing and hold this thing down and it turns your voice into radio waves and sends it into the heavens.
M	OSCAR	Heaven? CONTINUED: (4) 76
M	SHERM	Why don't you take it for a test drive.
F	NORAH	Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive?
F	ROSE	No.
M	OSCAR	Try the CB!
F	ROSE	Antenna's probably broke.
F	NORAH	Ice Cream Hut!
F	NORAH	How cool to live across from the Ice Cream Hut.
F	ROSE	You should rent it. Seriously, you're making money now. CONTINUED: 79
F	NORAH	Yeah well, what about Dad?
F	ROSE	Oh please, Dad would survive just fine. You should do it.
F	NORAH	Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter. Don't you teach this kid anything?
M	LYNN (O.S.)	It's the gorilla girl.
F	LYNN	You never came to donate.
F	NORAH	Yeah.
F	NORAH	My sister.
F	LYNN	We have snacks you know. Juice boxes.
F	NORAH	Had I known about the juice boxes... CONTINUED: (2) 79
F	LYNN	Okay. Well, see you around.
M	SHERM	You still selling that luggage?
M	JOE	No, no. That was a whole big mess.
M	SHERM	Crappy zippers. Wasn't that it?
M	JOE	Yeah, that's been a while now. Dropped the luggage around the time your other lot when out of business.
M	SHERM	I could maybe drop it to nineteen even.
M	SHERM	And toss in some wiper fluid.
F	ROSE	What the hell? CONTINUED: 81
F	NORAH	I just wanted to give her the pictures.
F	ROSE	You took the pictures? Why would you do that? We could get in a lot of trouble for that.
F	NORAH	Relax, I didn't give them to her.
F	NORAH	It's just three blocks away.
M	JOE	I know. CONTINUED: 82 It's not like I'm never gonna see you.
M	JOE	Hey, I think you should have done this a long time ago.
M	SPEAKER	OK. Let's take a quick break before we move on to potential pathogens suspended in excrement.
M	CARL	Food's better at the bar. Carl Swanson, Above and Beyond.
F	ROSE	Rose- Rose Lorkowski. Nice to meet you.
M	CARL	I hear you're my new competition. CONTINUED: 85
F	ROSE	We're hardly competition for you.
M	CARL	I'm glad to see you're doing a little homework. A lot of people, you know, they think they can just jump in to this, make lots of money. But, they don't know what they're doing. No idea. They're not professional and that makes us all look bad.
F	ROSE	Well, we're not like that. I just have to complete this seminar and we're certified.
M	CARL	You're not certified?
F	ROSE	Not yet. Probably by the end of the month.
M	CARL	You had a...
F	ROSE	I think it's starting.
M	CARL	Sure I can't buy you a drink?
M	CARL	If you spray the enzyme at that point it'll just turn back to liquid which is a pain in the ass. The key is to bag it when it's kind of Jell-o-ee. CONTINUED: 86
F	ROSE	That makes total sense. Why didn't I think of that?
M	CARL	You just figure all this shit out as you go. Experience.
F	ROSE	It's not how I thought it'd be. I thought it'd be gross.
F	ROSE	Sometimes it's gross. The maggots are gross. The maggots kind of freak me.
M	CARL	Yeah.
F	ROSE	The sound. The munching sound.
M	CARL	And it's so hard to kill the little fuckers.
F	ROSE	Tell me about it. You pour industrial bleach right on `em...nothing.
M	CARL	Just roll their eyes and call you a pussy. CONTINUED: 87
F	ROSE	I am strong. I am powerful.
M	OSCAR	What's a bastard?
M	OSCAR	Jeremy said I was a bastard. What does that mean?
F	NORAH	It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son. Use it to impress the chicks. Trust me, the whole bastard thing... it's working for you.
F	ROSE	Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well, I'm glad you liked the Fancy Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah.
F	ROSE	Okay... 2327 Grove Avenue. Got it... Sure. Yeah. Thank you. CONTINUED: 88
F	NORAH	What was that?
F	ROSE	A suicide!
F	ROSE	Oh, man.
F	ROSE	OK. Stay in the van. You want a soda or anything?
F	ROSE	We won't be long.
F	ROSE	Mrs. Davis?
F	ROSE	We're the cleaning service.
F	MRS. DAVIS	Yes, yes. I... I wanted to give you the keys.
F	MRS. DAVIS	In the sunroom. That's where my husband... I had bridge and... CONTINUED: 89 Do you need me to show you?
F	ROSE	No, no. I think we can find it.
F	MRS. DAVIS	Oh. Okay. That's good then.
F	MRS. DAVIS	My son-in-law's coming to take me to lunch at the Howard Johnson's. They have such nice rolls there.
F	ROSE	Would you like to sit for a moment, Mrs. Davis?
F	MRS. DAVIS	Yes dear, I think I would. CONTINUED: 91
F	NORAH	She okay?
M	OSCAR	That lady seemed really sad.
F	ROSE	Her husband died.
M	OSCAR	So he's in heaven?
M	OSCAR	Maybe we could let her use our CB and she could talk to him.
M	OSCAR	Maybe he would hear her.
F	ROSE	Maybe. CONTINUED: 93
M	OSCAR	I won a million dollars!
M	JOE	Let me see that.
M	JOE	You gotta get two hydrants with a matching amount. See? None of your fire hydrants match.
M	JOE	And three zeros is a thousand dollars. You woulda won a thousand dollars but it doesn't match anything.
M	OSCAR	What happens if it doesn't match anything?
M	JOE	You toss it and try the next one.
M	OSCAR	I think I won five hundred dollars.
M	OSCAR	I'm gonna buy a trampoline and a karaoke player and some chocolate honey dipped donuts. CONTINUED: 95
M	JOE	Whoa now. Hold up there kiddo. That's not your money. That's my money.
M	OSCAR	I scratched it.
M	JOE	Yes you did. You scratched the ticket that I bought. CONTINUED: (2) 95
M	JOE	And we're not going to spend the money. We're going to invest the money.
M	JOE	See, that's the difference between a regular person and somebody with business acumen. That's a good word for you to know. A-cu-men. Means smarts.
M	JOE	Bobby! Joe Lorkowski here. I told you I'd call. Yeah well, I got the money and we're in. But you gotta throw in twenty bags of ice.
M	OSCAR	We're gonna make the money grow because that's the smart way. It's capital and you don't spend that. You invest it. That way you can get the SP250 and have money left over.
F	ROSE	What are you talking about?
M	OSCAR	The binoculars that grampa's gonna get me for my birthday. CONTINUED: 96 They've got an internal stabilizer thingy that's electronic so if you're in a speed boat or something it won't matter and... CONTINUED: (2) 96
F	ROSE	Oh honey, come here.
F	ROSE	Sometimes your grampa promises things that he really wants to happen.
M	OSCAR	No, he's really gonna get `em. He's got a plan.
F	ROSE	Okay. If you say so.
F	NORAH	You made it seem so fun.
F	LYNN	Oh it is fun. Would you like a refreshment?
F	LYNN	No?
F	LYNN	Can you squeeze that for me?
F	LYNN	That's good. One more time. CONTINUED: 97
F	NORAH	Oh my God, is that the needle? It's a fucking cocktail straw.
F	LYNN	Trust me, I'm very good at this. Squeeze again.
F	LYNN	Wasn't that fun?
F	NORAH	You might have oversold it.
F	LYNN	Kind of twirl the ball around in your hand. Good. It doesn't hurt, does it?
F	NORAH	Feels hot.
F	LYNN	That's a good sign.
F	NORAH	My friend's having a thing tonight.
F	NORAH	Never mind.
F	LYNN	What?
F	NORAH	Nothing it's... CONTINUED: (2) 97
F	LYNN	What?
F	NORAH	You wouldn't like it.
F	LYNN	I might like it.
F	NORAH	I knew you wouldn't have any fun here.
F	LYNN	I am having fun.
F	LYNN	No thanks.
F	NORAH	Lambs breath.
F	LYNN	Yeah, no thanks.
F	NORAH	Straight edge?
F	LYNN	Just kind of superstitious. CONTINUED: 99
F	NORAH	She's Mormon.
F	LYNN	I'm not Mormon. I just... You're gonna think it's weird.
F	NORAH	What?
F	LYNN	Sometimes I think that when you get high or drink or alter your consciousness like that--
F	NORAH	You don't drink?
F	LYNN	I think it weakens you psychically... like it creates these cracks and then bad things can seep in and maybe never go away.
F	NORAH	All right, you're kind of freakin me out.
F	LYNN	Sorry.
F	NORAH	You should just tell people you're Mormon.
F	LYNN	I think your boyfriend is winning.
F	NORAH	Yes. Yes, he is. CONTINUED: (2) 99
F	LYNN	Breathe.
F	NORAH	I need more beer.
F	NORAH	Um. Can I get you anything?
F	LYNN	I'm good.
M	REPORTER	control driver crashed his car into a south side Quicky Lube killing one employee.
M	RANDY	What are you doing?
F	NORAH	Shh. CONTINUED: 100
M	REPORTER	The driver of the automobile, apparently suffered a heart attack at the wheel and is currently in critical condition.
F	NORAH	Hello.
M	RANDY	Unbelievable.
F	NORAH	Yeah, I'm watching it now.
M	RANDY	Hey.
M	RABBIT LADY	Hey.
M	RABBIT LADY	You like rabbits? CONTINUED: 103
M	OFFICER	Nut job goes through the window there. You guys are BBP Certified, right?
F	ROSE	Legally, it's not really necessary.
F	NORAH	We are.
F	ROSE	We're in the process.
F	NORAH	You went to that thing.
F	ROSE	We adhere to all the proper procedures when dealing with a potentially hazardous situation. We are very professional.
F	NORAH	Wait. I thought you went to that thing.
F	ROSE	Are you guys all finished?
M	OFFICER	It's all yours.
F	ROSE	Why don't you grab the wet-vac and I'll start bagging the loose stuff.
F	NORAH	I thought you went to the thing.
F	ROSE	I did. I mean, I went to part of it. Most of it.
F	NORAH	What do you mean you went to part of it? It was a one day thing.
F	ROSE	I got side tracked.
F	NORAH	Side tracked?
F	ROSE	That Above and Beyond guy was there. Carl. We got talking shop and--
F	NORAH	Oh my God, you humped Carl!
F	ROSE	I'm already registered for the next one.
F	NORAH	That's disgusting.
M	JOE	You got twenty bucks and you want three pizza's. They cost five dollars each and you have a coupon for two dollars off. You figure you'll tip the delivery guy a couple bucks but the delivery guy turns out to be a lady. Real sizzler. So you give her a crisp five. How much do you have left?
M	OSCAR	Two dollars?
M	JOE	Hey, how'd you come up with that?
M	OSCAR	Math.
M	JOE	The thing is Oscar...and this is important to learn early...life is sales. Buying and selling. It's the core of social interaction. And human beings are social beings. CONTINUED: 108
M	JOE	No, no, no, no, no. CONTINUED: 109
F	ROSE	I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted to let you know that we're all finished up and--
M	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN	Oh, you want to get paid.
F	ROSE	We can come back later if that's better.
M	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN	I can't believe I have to deal with this now. My son just died for Christ's sake.
F	ROSE	I'm so sorry for your loss.
M	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN	Thank you.
M	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN	For what you did. Thank you.
F	ROSE	You want a Coke?
F	NORAH	Sure.
F	ROSE	Dammit.
F	HEATHER	You think I don't know?
F	HEATHER	You may have been hot shit in high school but what are you now? Nothing. A waste of space.
M	JOE	Stupid shit heap!
M	JOE	It's alright. Everything's okay.
M	JOE	Come on, come on, come on, come on.
M	JOE	Make like you're crying.
F	ROSE	What did you guys do today?
M	OSCAR	Nothing.
F	ROSE	How's it without Norah here?
M	JOE	Weird.
M	RANDY	I'm sorry. I know it was stupid.
F	NORAH	On so many levels. CONTINUED: 114
M	RANDY	I'm really sorry. I swear it won't happen again. It's just... you weren't around and...
F	NORAH	Listen, Randy I think we should stop hanging out.
M	RANDY	You're breaking up with me over the rabbit lady?
M	RANDY	I don't know, the way you act, I didn't even think that you'd care that much.
F	NORAH	Yeah, I don't. I should, but I don't. And you're a really great guy. But...I don't care if you have sex with the rabbit lady... and I mean, it seems like I should care about that.
F	ROSE	Shit.
F	MAC	Rose.
F	ROSE	What are you doing here?
F	MAC	Can we talk a minute?
F	ROSE	Oscar's asleep. CONTINUED: 115
F	MAC	It was great seeing you last night. You looked so professional and confident. Your own business...
F	ROSE	How's the baby?
F	MAC	I just wanted to congratulate you on the business. Seems like things are really going great for you.
F	ROSE	They are. If we keep going at this rate I can hire a couple of employees soon, put a little more in marketing, give those Clean Sweep guys a run for their money.
F	ROSE	I'm a business woman.
F	MAC	You're a business woman.
F	NORAH	Ever been trestling? CONTINUED: 117
F	LYNN	Are the bodies there?
F	NORAH	No. The person is gone. It's weird `cuz we're connected to them in this strangely intimate way... but we never actually meet them. It's just kind of weird.
F	NORAH	I have seen a dead body once though.
F	LYNN	Yeah?
F	NORAH	My mom. CONTINUED: 120
F	NORAH	She was in a movie of the week once, ya know. CONTINUED: (2) 120
F	LYNN	Your mom?
F	NORAH	A bunch of Hollywood people were filming down in Old Town. They thought my mom was so beautiful and so talented that they gave her a speaking part. You want to hear it?
F	NORAH	`I recommend the pecan pie.'
F	LYNN	I recommend the pecan pie?
F	NORAH	That was her line. It was on TV and everything.
F	LYNN	That's pretty cool.
F	NORAH	Me and Rose, we didn't actually see it but Rose says mom talked about it all the time. I don't remember.
F	NORAH	I don't remember her much at all. I have this box of her stuff though, little things she touched. When it seems like she never even really existed... it's proof.
F	NORAH	All right. This is where we climb.
F	LYNN	What? CONTINUED: (3) 120
F	NORAH	Up to that girder.
F	LYNN	I'm not climbing up there.
F	NORAH	Best place to be when it comes.
F	LYNN	Uh-uh.
F	NORAH	You're gonna miss the best part.
F	LYNN	I accept that.
F	NORAH	pissed off God up in your face just screaming at you. So close you can smell the metal on his breath.
F	LYNN	Sounds great.
F	NORAH	It is. I'm telling you.
F	NORAH	I didn't mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff. I just thought you would... I don't know, I guess I thought...
F	LYNN	What? CONTINUED: (4) 120
F	NORAH	He's coming.
M	OSCAR	What was I before I was born? What happens when we die? Do animals go to the same place as we go after we die? Is heaven really crowded? When somebody gets an arm chopped off does it go to heaven? Is Jesus another name for you or are you two separate people? Were you born? Will you die? If you already live in heaven where do you go when you die? CONTINUED: 123
F	NORAH	Rose, wait for me.
F	LYNN	Oh, shit.
F	LYNN	You idiot.
F	NORAH	Sneaky fucker. CONTINUED: 125
F	LYNN	That was really stupid.
F	NORAH	I think I broke my hand.
F	LYNN	Really?
F	NORAH	No. But it hurts like a mother. CONTINUED: 129
F	ROSE	Oscar?
F	LYNN	How's the hand?
F	NORAH	Ow!
F	LYNN	Sorry.
F	LYNN	Better?
F	LYNN	Is that?
F	LYNN	Are those... CONTINUED: 130
F	LYNN	How do you have my school pictures?
F	NORAH	I just... I found them. I was gonna tell you.
F	LYNN	Where would you find old pictures of me?
F	NORAH	At work.
F	LYNN	What?
F	NORAH	We did this job a while back. This woman...
F	LYNN	My mom.
F	LYNN	My mom is dead.
F	NORAH	I wanted to tell you... that first day. That's why I--
F	LYNN	You knew this whole time?
F	NORAH	I think... You know, I think there's a reason that I found them. The pictures. Because that lead me to you, right? And I don't know exactly what went on between you and your mom... what the situation was... but it just seems like... You know, of anybody, I would understand.
F	LYNN	You would understand?
F	NORAH	Wait. Please. Don't...I--
F	LYNN	You're sick, you know that? There's something wrong with you.
F	ROSE	The blue or the flowery?
M	OSCAR	The blue.
F	ROSE	Good call. CONTINUED: 132
F	ROSE	Sunshine Cleaning.
M	INSURANCE GUY	Hello, this is Henry Schmidt at State Farm.
F	ROSE	State Farm? State Farm! Yes. Hello.
M	INSURANCE GUY	I spoke with you about a month ago.
F	ROSE	Yes! Hi. What can I do for you?
M	INSURANCE GUY	We've got a house we need to turn around and our regular guys are busy in Santa Fe today. Thought I'd give you all a call.
F	ROSE	Great. No problem.
F	ROSE	Shit, shit, shit.
F	ROSE	Honey, call grampa.
M	OSCAR	It's busy. CONTINUED: (2) 132
F	NORAH	Blow off the shower.
F	ROSE	I can't I... I RSVPed.
F	NORAH	So tell him we can't do it.
F	ROSE	It's an insurance company. They could throw us a ton of work. This is our in. So, don't go to the damn baby shower. It's not like you ever even liked Paula.
F	ROSE	I promise I'll come straight after the shower and help finish up. CONTINUED: 134
M	OSCAR	Pee-ew.
F	ROSE	Stay out here.
M	OSCAR	Why do I-- CONTINUED: (2) 134
F	ROSE	Because I said so.
F	ROSE	Dad!
F	ROSE	Dad! Daddy!
M	JOE	I'm busy here.
F	ROSE	Damn it dad, you scared me.
M	JOE	Those snotty restaurant fucks wouldn't buy my shrimp. Some bullshit about health codes or whatever. I don't believe that shit for a second.
F	ROSE	God, dad what were you-- CONTINUED: 136
M	JOE	Don't. Don't start with me. Bastards completely shut me out. They got their own little cartel. Little restaurant mafia. I bet they screwed with my car too. I wouldn't put it past `em. Bunch of shady mother fuckers.
F	ROSE	I need you to watch Oscar.
M	JOE	I can't.
F	ROSE	What do you mean you can't?
M	JOE	I can't watch Oscar today Rose.
F	ROSE	I'm in a real bind here.
M	JOE	Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it? Raising a kid on your own. Try two.
M	WINSTON	You look nice. CONTINUED: 138
F	ROSE	Thanks. CONTINUED: (2) 138
F	ROSE	I was wondering if Oscar could hang out here for a little while.
F	ROSE	I've got this baby shower to go to and Norah's working a job and my dad's incapacitated... Do you mind?
M	WINSTON	I guess not.
F	ROSE	You're a lifesaver.
M	WINSTON	You did your hair different.
F	ROSE	You like it?
F	ROSE	All right. Be good. I'll pick him up in a few hours when I'm done.
M	OSCAR	What's that?
M	WINSTON	This is a World War Two Mitchell Cannon Nose Bomber.
M	OSCAR	You make all these models? CONTINUED: 139 Dab the end of that in the glue. Just a little bit.
M	OSCAR	What's that piece for?
M	WINSTON	It's a strut.
M	OSCAR	What's a strut?
M	WINSTON	Supports the wing.
M	OSCAR	Seems like it'd be hard to build models with just one hand.
M	WINSTON	It is. CONTINUED: 142 CONTINUED: 143
M	MOUSEY	So Rose, what are you doing? Are you still cleaning houses?
F	PAULA	Rose has gone into real estate.
M	MOUSEY	Really?
F	ROSE	Actually, I own my own business.
M	MOUSEY	A real estate business?
F	ROSE	No. It's a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service. It's a growth niche industry right now ­ highly technical and competitive.
M	MOUSEY	What does that mean ­ biohazard removal whatever?
F	ROSE	A lot of times, when somebody dies, it can be kind of, you know, messy. So, we go in and clean up all that left over mess. Make sure that the area is clean and sanitary.
F	ROSE	People just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids. CONTINUED: 144 Oh my God.
F	ROSE	Course, we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um... professional techniques. Like I said, it's a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated, you know... methodology behind it.
F	ROSE	Real growth industry.
M	MOUSEY	I can't imagine. You like doing it?
F	ROSE	Yeah.
F	ROSE	I do. We come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound. They've lost somebody. The circumstances are different but that's the same.
F	ROSE	And we help them. In this one small way... we help.
M	MOUSEY	Sounds horrible to me.
F	PAULA	I believe I'd vomit. CONTINUED: 145
F	NORAH	Shit.
F	NORAH	Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind?
F	NORAH	It's okay.
F	NORAH	No, no, no. CONTINUED: 147
M	PEPPY	Okay, ladies. For our first game we've taken five different kinds of candy bars and melted them in these diapers.
M	MOUSEY	Oh I love this game.
M	PEPPY	You all can--
F	ROSE	Sorry.
M	PEPPY	You can look, smell and taste. The first to identify all five correctly wins!
F	ROSE	Hello, you've reached Sunshine Cleaning. You're call is very important to us so...
F	NORAH	FUCK! CONTINUED: 149
F	ROSE	You know what? I... uh...Actually, there's somewhere I need to be.
F	PAULA	Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're just starting the games.
F	ROSE	Yeah. Well... Yeah.
F	NORAH	It was an accident.
F	ROSE	Oh my God, what have you done?
F	NORAH	It was an accident. How does this happen? Huh? How do you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus fucking Christ!
F	NORAH	Jesus Rose, Calm down.
F	NORAH	Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me.
F	ROSE	This is on you. You did this. You set a fucking house on fire! You.
F	NORAH	Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing.
F	ROSE	I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility.
F	NORAH	I am so sick of all your holier than thou bullshit. Why don't you take a look at you're own life, huh? You're a real inspiration.
F	ROSE	Well maybe if I didn't have to take care of everybody in this family. CONTINUED: (2) 151
F	NORAH	Fuck you. I'm done being your excuse.
F	ROSE	Oh that's great. Turn everything to shit and then walk away.
F	ROSE	Great.
M	WINSTON	Long baby shower.
F	ROSE	I'm sorry, I... everything's horrible.
M	WINSTON	Oscar's asleep in back.
F	ROSE	Norah's ruined everything. She burnt down a house. A client's house. CONTINUED: 153
M	WINSTON	Yeah.
F	ROSE	You know?
M	WINSTON	Carl told me.
F	ROSE	How does he...?
F	ROSE	That's just great. We burnt down a client's house. How do you get around that?
M	WINSTON	Insurance?
F	ROSE	I figured we'd wait and get the better rate once I got certified.
M	WINSTON	Didn't you go to that?
F	ROSE	There's not a lot I'm really good at, you know. CONTINUED: (2) 153
F	ROSE	Really. I'm good at getting guys to want me. Not date or marry me. But want me. I've always been good at that.
F	ROSE	And cheering. I was pretty good at that too.
M	WINSTON	Cheering is good.
F	ROSE	Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd think.
F	ROSE	You brush your teeth?
M	MAC (O.S.)	Rose?
F	MAC	Hey beautiful.
F	MAC	I was starting to think you were on a date or something.
F	MAC	You okay?
F	ROSE	Long day.
F	MAC	Can I come in?
F	ROSE	It's not really a good time.
F	MAC	I got you something.
F	MAC	It's for your business cards. You put `em in there and, I don't know... impress people.
F	ROSE	It's beautiful. CONTINUED: 157
F	MAC	You don't like it?
F	ROSE	No, I like it very much.
F	ROSE	It's just this thing we're doing.
F	MAC	Come on, let's not do that.
F	ROSE	I don't want this anymore.
F	MAC	So that's it?
F	MAC	That's it then.
M	GUY IN WHITE COAT (O.S.)	Is this your first time donating?
F	NORAH	No. CONTINUED: 158
M	GUY IN WHITE COAT	Can I get your name?
F	NORAH	I need to talk to Lynn.
F	LYNN	She can't donate. You can't donate.
F	LYNN	Forty-eight days. It's not been forty-eight days.
F	NORAH	Why are you acting like this? Why haven't you called me back.
F	LYNN	Listen, I just, don't think you're the kind of person I need to be hanging out with right now. What's that supposed to mean?
F	LYNN	Do I really need to spell it out?
F	NORAH	Here. CONTINUED: 159
M	WINSTON	I'm sure I can turn this stuff around pretty quick.
F	ROSE	Thanks. For everything.
M	OSCAR	Are you coming to my party?
F	ROSE	We're going to Hinkle's Saturday for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great if you came.
M	WINSTON	Sounds like a blast.
M	JOE	That other pair we looked at, full of gadgets and gimmicks. They just didn't have the heft you want in a pair of lenses. No weight. No history.
M	JOE	These here are the real deal. I want you to have them.
F	ROSE	Dad, you promised him those others. From the store. He's been talking about it for weeks.
M	JOE	No Rose, I want to him to have these.
M	WINSTON	Wow, is that an old Zeiss?
M	WINSTON	Porro prism?
M	JOE	Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks on the objectives. Perfect bloom.
M	WINSTON	You got yourself some classic binoculars there.
F	NORAH	Sorry I'm late. CONTINUED: (2) 162
F	NORAH	Hey.
M	JOE	Where are you going?
F	NORAH	Winston cleans up pretty good. CONTINUED: 163
F	NORAH	I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all that. So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot.
F	NORAH	Listen, I know I fucked up, okay? Like really huge and I know that and I'm sorry, okay?
F	ROSE	God, that drives me crazy! That whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a big fuck up' routine. Like that's a legitimate excuse.
F	NORAH	I really am sorry. But it really isn't all my fault, Rose.
F	ROSE	I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job. CONTINUED: (2) 163
F	NORAH	You finished? CONTINUED: (3) 163
F	ROSE	I know. I should have been there.
F	NORAH	What are you going to do now?
F	ROSE	I got some ideas. I was thinking maybe we could--
F	NORAH	I've got my own ideas.
F	ROSE	So, you really think he's hot?
F	NORAH	Winston? No.
F	NORAH	You gonna open my present?
M	OSCAR	Cool.
F	NORAH	The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month. And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit. They're all based on classic biker designs.
M	OSCAR	Cool.
F	ROSE	What's that say?
F	NORAH	Li'l bastard.
F	ROSE	Cool.
F	NORAH	I'm thinking of taking a road trip.
M	JOE	Where?
F	ROSE	How?
F	NORAH	Haven't worked it all out yet. I was thinking I could maybe take the van.
F	ROSE	I'm selling the van.
M	JOE	Don't sell the van.
F	ROSE	Have to. Can't afford the payment.
M	JOE	No, listen... just don't sell the van. CONTINUED: (2) 164
M	JOE	Just don't sell the van yet. Okay?
M	JOE	Rose tells me you make models.
M	WINSTON	Yeah.
M	JOE	Any money in that?
M	WINSTON	Not really.
F	NORAH	What?
F	ROSE	Turn your TV on. Channel sixty- five. CONTINUED: 167 What's good?
M	TV WAITRESS/MOTHER	I recommend the pecan pie.
F	ROSE	Hello? Mom?
F	ROSE	Oscar turned eight today. We had this whole big thing at Hinkle's. Winston came. After dinner Oscar and Norah got a high score on Centipede and put in ASS as their initials and got in trouble by the manager. I don't know if you're in heaven or what. But you're not here and that's too bad for you `cuz you've missed out. You've missed out on some really great stuff.
F	ROSE	Dad?
M	JOE	There's something I wanted to talk to you about.
F	ROSE	Okay.
M	JOE	Well, I was wondering if I could move in with you and Oscar.
F	ROSE	What?
M	JOE	Just temporarily - until I find a place.
F	ROSE	You lost the house. Oh my god, you lost the house. Dad how could you lose the house?
M	JOE	I didn't lose the house. I sold the house. There's this business opportunity--
F	ROSE	Not shrimp I hope. CONTINUED: 170
M	JOE	It's not just some get rich quick scheme. And I got a partner who has experience. I'd learn from her.
F	ROSE	Nineteen sixty-three?
M	JOE	Don't make a big deal out of it.
F	ROSE	Dad.
M	JOE	It's a business lie, not a real lie.
F	ROSE	I can live with that.
M	JOE	And you'd be the boss.
F	ROSE	Thank you. CONTINUED: 173
M	KOKO	I have a tooth ache.
F	NORAH	Me too.
