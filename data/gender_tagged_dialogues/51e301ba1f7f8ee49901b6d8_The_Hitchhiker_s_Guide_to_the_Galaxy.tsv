M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	GUIDE VOICE	It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double- backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but in fact the message was this... "So long and thanks for all the fish." Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the

M	ARTHUR	What do you mean he's gone out to lunch? You just said he was still at breakfast!
M	PROSSER	Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever.
M	ARTHUR	I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.
M	PROSSER	This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago.
M	ARTHUR	The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	PROSSER	Look. These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year.
M	ARTHUR	On display? I had to go down to a cellar!
M	PROSSER	That's the display department.
M	ARTHUR	I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.
M	PROSSER	Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
M	ARTHUR	How much?
M	PROSSER	None at all.
M	FORD (O.S.)	Arthur! towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket. He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.
M	ARTHUR	Ford?
M	FORD	Arthur! There you are. Here drink and eat with me. We need to talk.
M	ARTHUR	Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford They're going to demolish my home,
M	FORD	Whoa. You already know? How? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Oh. When you say "they" you mean they. Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you something important, and I gotta tell you now.
M	ARTHUR	But what about my house? The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
M	FORD	C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers.
M	ARTHUR	Can we trust him?
M	FORD	I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.
M	ARTHUR	And how far's that?
M	FORD	About twelve minutes away.
M	FORD	Six pints of bitter. And quickly. The world's about to end.
M	BARMAN	Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.
M	ARTHUR	Well, when does he get back from lunch? Or is he going straight out for tea?!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	This is shaping up to be a crap day. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	It's about to get a lot crappier.
M	BARMAN	There you are, six pints.
M	FORD	Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to spend it.
M	ARTHUR	Three? At lunchtime?
M	FORD	Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
M	ARTHUR	Very deep. You should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you.
M	FORD	Drink up.
M	ARTHUR	Why three pints?
M	FORD	Muscle relaxant. And eat these. You'll need the salt.
M	ARTHUR	What's going on. Ford?
M	FORD	What would you say if I told you I wasn't really from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Eetelgeuse?
M	ARTHUR	Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say?
M	FORD	Remember when we met? That car was racing toward me, I was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
M	FORD	Didn't you find it a little strange that I was trying to shake hands with a car?
M	ARTHUR	I assumed you were drunk.
M	FORD	I thought cars were the dominant life form. I was trying to introduce myself.
M	ARTHUR	And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies?
M	FORD	You saved my life that day. Now I'm saving yours.
M	ARTHUR	This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays.
M	FORD	Look, if it's about your house...
M	ARTHUR	No, it's not that. It's....
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I told you about?
M	FORD	This isn't a long story, is it? We've only got six minutes. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD (CONT'D)	Okay. Talk and drink. Fancy dress party.
M	ARTHUR	At that flat in Islington. I told you about it. Last week, remember?
M	ARTHUR (V.O.)	I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, I don't know, brush the dog. Anything. But there I was -- and then, there she was...
M	TRICIA (O.S.)	Who are you?
M	ARTHUR	I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.
M	TRICIA	No, I mean who are you?
M	ARTHUR	Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um... Livingston, I presume. Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice.
M	TRICIA	You're the first person who's got it right. Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock.
M	ARTHUR	Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.
M	ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics, another in biology...
M	TRICIA	I've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable. Let's drink to that!
M	ARTHUR (V.O.)	And just as I was asking myself, "Why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out of nowhere she says...
M	TRICIA	Let's go somewhere.
M	ARTHUR	Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a lovely little cafe around the corner...
M	TRICIA	I was thinking Madagascar.
M	ARTHUR	Is that a new club on Dean Street?
M	TRICIA	No. It's a country. Off the coast of Africa.
M	ARTHUR	Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go then. Good God, you're serious. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Well...that's...an extraordinary proposition. But...I can't just up and go. What about my job?
M	TRICIA	Quit. Get a new one when we return.
M	ARTHUR	I can't just...what about my house? Who would feed my dog?
M	TRICIA	Bring him with.
M	ARTHUR	He's a Welsh Collie. He'd feel all out of place in Madagascar. You don't want to go to Madagascar.
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy -- of course, you probably already know that. I'm headed for a lost and distant planet. Would you like to see my spaceship? I went to refresh our drinks. When I came back, she was gone.
M	ARTHUR	"Would you like to see my spaceship?" Really, what sort of chat up line is that?
M	FORD	More popular than you'd think.
M	ARTHUR	I've left messages, sent letters... It's like she's vanished off the face of the earth. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	Hey, it happens. Speaking of... We've got two minutes. So drink up.
M	ARTHUR	My house!
M	FORD	A round for everyone, on me.
M	BARMAN	You really think the world's going to end? Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something?
M	FORD	If you want.
M	BARMAN	Will it help?
M	FORD	Not really.
M	BARMAN	Last orders, then?
M	ARTHUR	STOP! STOP, YOU BASTARDS!! blown sideways. Trees are uprooted. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D}	WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE THINGS?!
M	FORD	Ships from a Vogon Constructor Fleet. I picked up their signal this morning.
M	FORD {CONT'D}	Here. You'll need this. People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace planning council.
M	JELTZ (VOICE ONLY)	As you are probably aware, plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system...
M	JELTZ	...and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	TECHNICIAN	Hello! Can you hear us? Please respond!
M	JELTZ (INTO THE P.A.)	There's no point in acting all surprised about it. The plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints.
M	VOGON CAPTAIN	What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.
M	JELTZ	Apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all. Energize the demolition beams.
M	JELTZ (O.S.)	Detonate. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GUIDE VOICE	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book...
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD PERSON, ANYWAY?
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in large friendly letters on its cover. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	So you're not from Guilford, which would explain the accent -- which I've always wondered about...and you're not an out of work actor -- but rather a writer for this...this...book thing. I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.
M	FORD	Here. Eat these. If you've never been through a transmat beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein.
M	ARTHUR	If I asked where we were would I regret
M	FORD	We're safe. For now.
M	ARTHUR	Good.
M	FORD	We're in a storage hold in one of the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet ...
M	ARTHUR	Obviously some strange usage of the word safe I wasn't previously aware of.
M	FORD	Is it?
M	ARTHUR	Tell me you're joking.
M	FORD	Okay. I'm joking.
M	ARTHUR	And do a reassuring little laugh.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Now tell me where we really are. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	In the storage hold of a Vogon constructor ship.
M	ARTHUR	Get me home. Ford.
M	FORD	Home? Arthur...your home... is...
M	ARTHUR	Oh God - it was demolished! I've got to reach my lawyer! He must be back from lunch by now...
M	FORD	You don't remember, do you? Okay. I've got something to tell you. It ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have to just deal, okay?
M	ARTHUR	Good god. Is this really the interior of a flying saucer?
M	FORD	Yeah. Why?
M	ARTHUR (V.O.)	Well, it's a bit squalid isn't it?
M	FORD (V.O.)	Hey man, you're in denial.
M	ARTHUR	Blown up? BLOWN UP?! Couldn't you have done something?!!
M	FORD	I did. I saved you. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	But there's six billion other people.
M	FORD	And all those ants.
M	ARTHUR	Yes, but ants aren't exactly people!
M	FORD	And now you're thinking like a Vogon. I saved your life, okay? Which makes us even. Next thing.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive out here, you really gotta know where your towel is. Now gimme a hand over here.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	Careful, it's hot.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	We've got to get off this ship before the Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. Pull.
M	ARTHUR	What's a Vogon?
M	FORD	Ask the guide. Say "Vogons."
M	ARTHUR	"Vogons."
M	GUIDE VOICE	Vogons. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters. The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you.
M	FORD	They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run things. And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty.
M	ARTHUR	It can't be gone. It can't be! Earth!
M	FORD	Shhh!
M	ARTHUR	EARTH!!
M	GUIDE VOICE	Earth.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	Harmless. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? "Harmless?"
M	FORD	Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded.
M	ARTHUR	What does it say now?
M	FORD	Mostly harmless.
M	ARTHUR	Ahhh, what the hell is that?!
M	FORD	Here. Put this in your ear.
M	ARTHUR	WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH...
M	ARTHUR	Argh! What's happening...?
M	JELTZ (ON SPEAKER)	This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention!
M	FORD	The fish. It's translating for you.
M	JELTZ (ON SPEAKER)	According to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	JELTZ (CONT'D)	...and this is not a taxi service for degenerate freeloaders.
M	VOGON GUARD	Resistance is useless!
M	GUIDE VOICE	The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe.
M	GUIDE VOICE	It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable thing that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved in the Universe purely by chance that many thinkers have chosen to see this as a final clinching proof of the NON-existence of God.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	The argument goes something like this... "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing." HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	"But," says Man, "the Babelfish is a dead give-away. It proves you exist, and so therefore you don't. QED." "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book, 'WELL THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP FOR GOD.'
M	VOGON GUARD	Resistance is useless!
M	ARTHUR	Ford...
M	FORD	Don't panic. If we're lucky, they'll throw us out into space.
M	ARTHUR	And if we're unlucky? He faces them, holds up a book entitled... " " --
M	JELTZ	Oh freddled gruntbuggly! Thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GUIDE VOICE	Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.
M	JELTZ	Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don't!
M	GUIDE VOICE	The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix. It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was.
M	JELTZ	So, Earthlings, I present you with a simple choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or -- tell what you thought of my poem.
M	ARTHUR	Actually...I rather liked it.
M	FORD	Good tact. Run with it.
M	ARTHUR	Um...some of the words I didn't understand, but I found the imagery quite effective.
M	JELTZ	Continue. . . HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity...
M	FORD	Vogonity!
M	ARTHUR	... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er...
M	FORD	... whatever it was ...
M	ARTHUR	... the poem was about.
M	FORD	Damn.
M	ARTHUR	What?
M	FORD	I think you just saved my life again.
M	JELTZ	An astute analysis. Very impressive. Throw them off the ship.
M	VOGON GUARD	Resistance is useless!
M	JELTZ	Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor..." Death's too good for them.
M	ARTHUR	So this is it? We're going to die? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	Yes. No, wait! What's this switch? No, it's nothing. We are going to die.
M	ARTHUR	You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.
M	FORD	Why? What did you she tell you?
M	ARTHUR	I don't know. I didn't listen.
M	FORD	You're sweating. to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then --
M	GUIDE VOICE	"Space..." says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space..." and so on.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	It also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds -- but with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	...which, by a staggering coincidence, is also the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur once went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to connect with.
M	FEMALE VOICE (TRILLIAN)	Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling...
M	FEMALE VOICE (TRILLIAN)	Two to the power of ten thousand to one against and falling.
M	ARTHUR	Ford...
M	FORD	Yes?
M	ARTHUR	I think I'm a sofa.
M	FORD	I think I know how you feel.
M	FEMALE VOICE (TRILLIAN)	Five to one against and falling...
F	TRILLIAN	Four to one against and falling... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	...and of course, the top story is still the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of Gold last week, stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox.
M	ZAPHOD (ON TV)	So, in the name of the people and freedom and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like that, I hereby declare this ship officially stolen!
M	FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)	Three to one...two to one...
F	TRILLIAN	Probability factor of one to one...we have normality, I repeat we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon.
M	ZAPHOD	Hey. Do you mind? I can't hear.
F	TRILLIAN	Can we put your ego aside for one moment? Something important has happened.
M	ZAPHOD	If there's anything more important than my ego on this ship, I want it caught and shot now. ...the question everyone seems to be asking is, has the Big Z finally flipped? We asked his private brain care Specialist, Gag Halfrunt...
M	GAG HALFRRUNT	Vell, Zaphod's just zis guy, you know -- HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	Hey...
F	TRILLIAN	We have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay. I didn't pick them up. The ship did.
M	ZAPHOD	Huh?
F	TRILLIAN	When you engaged the Improbability Drive.
M	ZAPHOD	I didn't engage the drive.
F	TRILLIAN	We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha -- where you picked me up.
M	ZAPHOD	That's impossible.
F	TRILLIAN	No. Just very, very improbable.
M	ZAPHOD	I don't have time for this! We've got the police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, eh?
F	TRILLIAN	Marvin! shouldered toward Zaphod.
M	MARVIN	I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.
F	TRILLIAN	We have something to take your mind off things. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	MARVIN	It won't work, I have an exceptionally large mind.
F	TRILLIAN	I know. Go down to the number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here.
M	MARVIN	Just that?
F	TRILLIAN	Yes.
M	MARVIN	I won't enjoy it.
M	ZAPHOD	She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do it will you?
M	MARVIN	All right. I'll do it.
M	MARVIN (CONT'D)	I'm not getting you down at all am I?
F	TRILLIAN	No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just part of life.
M	MARVIN	Life. Don't talk to me about life.
M	DOOR	Mmmmmyaaahhhhhh!
M	VOGON CAPTAIN	Commander Kwaltz. We've located the spaceship Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox. Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Requesting hyperspace clearance. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)	Hold your position, captain, until clearance is granted.
M	KWALTZ	Get me the vice-president.
M	KWALTZ (CONT'D)	Hyperspace permission granted, Captain.
M	ARTHUR	Now this is more like my idea of a spaceship. Look at all these buttons...
M	FORD	Shhh.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	This way.
M	DOOR	Thank you for using this door. I've enjoyed opening for you. Hhmmyaahh...
M	MARVIN (0.S.)	Ghastly, isn't it? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	MARVIN (CONT'D)	I've been ordered to take you up to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you up to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? - 'cause I don't.
M	DOOR	What a pleasure it is to open for you. I will gladly close for you now.
M	MARVIN	"All the doors in this spacecraft have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.
M	MARVIN (CONT'D)	Hateful, isn't it? You can thank the Marketing Division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation for building robots with GPP.
M	ARTHUR	GPP?
M	MARVIN	"Genuine People Personalities." I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't you?
M	ARTHUR	Er. . .
M	MARVIN	Sorry, did I say something wrong? Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway, so I don't know why I even bother to say it. Oh god, I'm so depressed. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 And then I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side. I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens.
M	ARTHUR	Really? Wonder why?
M	FORD	Probably because he's so negative.
M	ARTHUR	Yes, I know. I was being...never mind.
M	MARVIN	I've brought the aliens. Don't thank me or anything.
M	ZAPHOD	Freeze!
M	MARVIN	Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?
M	ZAPHOD	I wasn't talking to you.
M	FORD	Zaphod?
M	ZAPHOD	Ixxie? It is you! IXXIE!
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Praxibetel Ix, you zarking hoopy! What the hell are you doing here?
M	FORD	I don't know! Just stuck out the thumb and here I am. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	That is so you.
M	FORD	And look at you! President? Last time I saw you, you were a beach bum.
M	ZAPHOD	Is it a great galaxy or what? I still can't believe this. Ixxie! Here! ON MY SHIP!
M	FORD	Hey, it's Ford now.
M	ZAPHOD	Hmm?
M	FORD	My name. It's Ford Prefect. Picked it up on Earth. Sorta grew on me.
M	ZAPHOD	Okay "Ford" -- you zarking frood.
M	FORD	Oh, this is Arthur. Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox. My cousin? Semi-half brother?
M	ZAPHOD	He shares three of the same mothers as me.
M	ARTHUR	We've met.
M	ZAPHOD	Have we? Sorry. I've got a terrible memory for species.
F	TRILLIAN	Everything okay?
M	ZAPHOD	Hey, hon. Come here. You won't believe this. Ix...um, sorry..."Ford"...this is...
M	ARTHUR	Tricia McMillan?
F	TRILLIAN	Arthur? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	I can't believe this...I've been looking...and you're here? I went to get wine and...
F	TRILLIAN	I know. And it was rude to just leave, but I told you I wanted to get away, and he had a spaceship parked outside, well, honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a book type. But you're here...
M	ARTHUR	Actually -- I am that type. But...well you do know what happened, don't you?
M	ZAPHOD	--Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride, and here we all are. Now, enough small talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember? I stole a ship?
M	ARTHUR	We're having a bit of a chat if you don't mind. somewhere under his chin.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up or I'll kick you in the gones!
M	FORD	There's the Zaphod I remember.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford. He's a guest on my ship.
M	FORD	I thought you said you stole it. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Fine. Get technical.
F	TRILLIAN	Are you all right?
M	ARTHUR	I feel like a bloody idiot. I've spent all week looking for Tricia McMillan and that isn't even your name.
F	TRILLIAN	It is my name. I shortened it.
M	ZAPHOD (0.S.)	Trillian...!
M	ARTHUR	Well, I'm still Arthur. Just plain average one-headed doesn't-own-a-space ship Arthur. Sorry to disappoint.
M	ZAPHOD (O.S.)	A little help over here?
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a missile! DO SOME DAMAGE!
F	TRILLIAN	Computer?
M	EDDIE	Hi, guys, this is Eddie your shipboard computer and I just know I'm gonna get a bundle of kicks out of any program you want to run through me.
F	TRILLIAN	Can you identify our pursuers? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	EDDIE	I'd be happy to! Stand by, please. Hey, guys, I'm just pleased as punch to report that it's a fleet of a hundred Vogon Battle Destroyers. You must be super important to warrant such an effort, and gee am I impressed. They're sending a message. I'd be super happy to play it.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Fine! Play it!! This people personality thing is gonna drive me nuts! Can't you change it?
M	QUESTULAR (ON MONITOR)	This is Vice President Questular Rontok. I am speaking to the kidnapper of the President. Surrender your stolen vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Leap to hyperspace!
M	EDDIE	Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you we need proper authorization before entering a hyperspace expressway.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Or else what? They'll send a hundred and one ships? DO it!
M	FORD	Brace yourself. This is a bit like being drunk.
M	ARTHUR	What's so bad about being drunk?
M	FORD	Ask a glass of water. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 KWALTZ Did they have proper hyperspace authorization?
M	VOGON WORKER	No, Commander.
M	KWALTZ	Add that to their list of offences! Blatant disregard for protocol.
F	QUESTULAR	You do realize he did what he did because he knew this is what you would do.
M	KWALTZ	Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President. And they are made to be followed.
F	QUESTULAR	Don't you think this many ships is a bit, oh I don't know -- excessive?
M	KWALTZ	The provisions are clear. Under subsection 37a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-
M	KWALTZ (CONT'D)	-- and these are the forces we deploy to apprehend any intentional or actual kidnapper.
F	QUESTULAR	You are aware, Commander, that the President kidnapped himself.
M	KWALTZ	Hence...
F	QUESTULAR	Do you have any idea how ridiculous this is?
M	KWALTZ	I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President. I just do what I do. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Damn, I'm good.
M	ZAPHOD	So -- you along for the ride or am I dropping you somewhere?
M	FORD	Depends. Where you going?
M	ZAPHOD	Into the pages of history, cousin. And when you see what I'm about to show you, you'll beg me to take you with us.
F	TRILLIAN	You okay?
M	ARTHUR	Normally I would say "I'll live," but given the circumstances... Is there any tea on this spaceship?
F	TRILLIAN	This way.
M	ZAPHOD	Hey, apeman. Earthman. I'm sorry, what was your name again?
M	ARTHUR	Arthur. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	Right. No hard feelings, okay? And sorry to hear about your planet, but don't mention it to the girl because if you do I'll...I'll...
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	I'll pull your spleen out through your ass!
M	FORD	Two heads. Interesting choice.
M	ZAPHOD	Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain.
M	FORD	So you carved it up?
M	ZAPHOD	Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is-- --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and that's when I realized I had this.
F	TRILLIAN	I suppose I should have said it resembles tea.
M	ARTHUR	So two heads is what does it for a girl, then? I mean, if I'd had two heads. Or three?
F	TRILLIAN	Or your own space ship. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	Anything else he's got two of?
F	TRILLIAN	Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.
M	ARTHUR	Well, what am I supposed to be like? Green? Bleeping? What?
F	TRILLIAN	Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it hurt?
M	ARTHUR	No, I suppose it wouldn't..
F	TRILLIAN	I mean...
M	TRILLIAN (CONT'D)	I might have an aspirin.
M	TRILLIAN (CONT'D)	Hey. What are they doing in there? They were from my lab at university. Odd...
M	ARTHUR	So all that's left is me and you, "mostly harmless," and two lab rats.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Look, there's something I should tell you... Showtime, Trill!
F	TRILLIAN	Can it keep? You might want to see this. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	--and when I saw what I'm about to show you, that's when I realized why I did what I did to my brain -- or it least, I think that's why.
M	DEEP THOUGHT	What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence?
M	LUNKWILL	Your task, O computer...
M	FOOK	Hang on. Did you say second greatest?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Second greatest. Yes.
M	FOOK	But we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could...
M	LUNKWILL	You're not talking about the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus, mention it not.
M	FOOK	The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	DEEP THOUGHT	The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.
M	FOOK	Then what's the problem?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to need.
M	LUNKWILL	Let's just ask the question.
M	FOOK	Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We want you to tell us -- the Answer.
M	DEEP THOUGHT	The Answer...to what?
M	LUNKWILL	You know. The answer. To Life...the Universe...Everything.
M	FOOK	We'd really like an answer. Something simple. Can you do it?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an answer. But I'll have to think about it. Return to this place in exactly... seven and a half million years.
M	LUNKWILL & FOOK	What?!
M	FORD	That's it? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	No, no. There's more. They go back.
M	ARTHUR	Seven and a half million years later?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Can I help you?
M	FOOK	Deep Thought. Do you have...
M	DEEP THOUGHT	An answer for you? Yes. I have.
M	FOOK	There really is an answer?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Yes. There really is one.
M	FOOK	Oh!
M	LUNKWILL	Can you tell us what it is?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Yes. Though I don't think you're going to like it.
M	FOOK	Doesn't matter! We must know it!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	You're really not going to like it.
M	FOOK	Tell us!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Alright. The answer to the ultimate question ...
M	LUNKWILL	Yes ... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 DEEP THOUGHT ... of Life, the Universe, and Everything ...
M	FOOK	Yes!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	... is ...
M	CROWD	Yes ...!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Forty two.
M	DEEP THOUGHT (O.S.) (CONT'D)	I checked it thoroughly. It would have been simpler, of course, to have known what the actual question was.
M	LUNKWILL	But it was the Question. The Ultimate Question!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Yes, but what actually is it? Everything! You know ... just EVERYTHING!
M	DEEP THOUGHT (O.S.)	That's not a question. Only when you know what the actual question will you know what the answer means.
M	LUNKWILL	Give us the Ultimate Question then!!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	I can't. But there is one who can. A computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program. I shall design this computer for you. And it shall be called... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	That's it?
M	ZAPHOD	That's it.
M	FORD	You're looking for the Ultimate Question?
M	ZAPHOD	Yep.
M	FORD	You.
M	ZAPHOD	Me.
M	FORD	Why?
M	ZAPHOD	No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work. Let's get her ready, babe.
M	FORD	I mean, why do you want to know the Ultimate Question?
M	ZAPHOD	Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's for the fame and the money.
M	ARTHUR	But -- you're President of the Galaxy, aren't you?
M	ZAPHOD	Yes, Arman.
M	ARTHUR	Arthur.
M	ZAPHOD	Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary, I find the Question, that's permanent. It sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep. Win-win. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 FORD But you don't know the name of the computer that other computer was talking about.
M	ZAPHOD	Which is why I'm going there.
M	FORD	Where?
M	ZAPHOD	There. To find Deep Thought. On Magrathea.
M	FORD	Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a legend...
M	ZAPHOD	No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.
M	FORD	You mean to tell me you carved up your brain so you could become President so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this ship...so you could steal it... so you could go to Magrathea -- which, according to most sane people, doesn't even exist?
M	ZAPHOD	Yep.
M	FORD	Beautiful.
M	ARTHUR	Why this ship? What's so special about it?
M	ZAPHOD	I don't seem to be letting myself in on any of my secrets.
M	TRILLIAN (O.S.)	Because of this, obviously. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	Infinite Improbability Drive? So they finally built one that works. And that's how we got picked up.
M	ZAPHOD	Exactly. And I'm guessing if we hit that button -- we go to Magrathea.
M	ARTHUR	You're guessing?
M	ZAPHOD	Hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's the door. Now who's in?
M	FORD	For a trip to a place that doesn't exist? I'm in. My editor will think I'm crazy, but what the hell -- he already thinks I'm dead.
F	TRILLIAN	Definitely. I'm in.
M	ARTHUR	Do I even have a choice?
M	ZAPHOD	No!
M	ARTHUR	What exactly does an Infinite Improbability Drive do?
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	THIS!! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood.
M	GUIDE VOICE	Such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.
M	KWALTZ	Well, Captain...?
M	GUIDE VOICE	Many respectable physicists said they weren't going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.
M	VOGON CAPTAIN	We had them sir. These are the coordinates. But -- they're not here.
M	KWALTZ	I can see that. WHERE ARE THEY? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	KNITTED ZAPHOD	Is this going to happen every time we hit that button?
M	KNITTED TRILLIAN	Very probably, yes.
M	ARTHUR	Did it work? Are we there?
M	ZAPHOD	Yes!...I think. Computer?
M	EDDIE	Hi, fella!
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Can you please change that zarking annoying voice!!?
F	TRILLIAN	Computer? What planet is that, please?
M	EDDIE	CHECKING!!
M	ARTHUR	Did you just pluck a hair from my head?
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Yeah, as if, apeman. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	EDDIE	Thanks for waiting, everyone. I'm just tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle 6.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Humma Kavula!
M	VOGON CAPTAIN	Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should I pursue?
M	KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)	That is not a request to which I can respond, captain. Should I pursue what? Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so that you may pursue the fugitive?
M	VOGON CAPTAIN	Yes, commander.
M	KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)	Then you must say that, captain -- in request form.
M	VOGON CAPTAIN	Requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue the fugitive, sir.
M	KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)	Thank you. Request acknowledged. Await response.
M	KWALTZ	Bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
F	QUESTULAR	This is ridiculous! What do you need, an executive order? Fine. I order you. Stop doing this! Go and get him!
M	KWALTZ	According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2, you're not authorized to make such an order.
F	QUESTULAR	But I'm acting president!
M	KWALTZ	Then act like a president, and do nothing.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Humma Kavula!
M	ARTHUR	Why does he keep saying that?
F	TRILLIAN	I don't know. I'm not used to seeing him this way.
M	ARTHUR	You mean fully clothed?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Sorry, but I can't for the life of me figure out why you, the most brilliant woman I have ever met, have ended up with that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid politician! I mean, look at him! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 TRILLIAN Clearly unlike any guy I've ever met. Look, if you're going to pout your way around space, then maybe you should just go home.
M	ARTHUR	I can't. That's the whole point -- and I've been trying to tell you...
M	FORD	Hey, look what I found in the guide.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	I wouldn't tell her if I were you.
M	ARTHUR	She deserves to know.
M	FORD	But if you tell her and she ends up with you because you're literally the last guy on Earth -- you'll always doubt her intentions.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	Got your towel? Do I need it?
M	FORD	Only always.
M	GUIDE VOICE	In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle 6 firmly believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 of the time they call "The Coming of Great White Handkerchief" are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each. ...who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Humma Kavula!
M	ZAPHOD	I'll handle this. something, oozing charm. The creature points down the street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
M	HUMMA KAVULA	The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are you ready? Let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us.
M	HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)	Almighty Arkleseizure, we lift our noses, clogged and unblown in reverence to you.
M	ZAPHOD	Hello, Humma. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	That's Humma Kavula? I thought he was just using a swear word.
M	FORD	Humma Kavula was his opponent in the election. Something happened during the campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.
M	ARTHUR	What was it?
M	HUMMA KAVULA	Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may wipe us clean. We ask this in your precious holy name...
M	CONGREGATION	Achoo.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	Bless you.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President. The Arkleseizure has exhaled many blessings upon you. What brings you to our humble planet?
M	ZAPHOD	I think you know why I'm here.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	I don't think I do.
M	ZAPHOD	Oh, I think you think you don't, but we both know -- you do.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your ability to communicate a clear thought never ceases to amaze. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	You called me stupid!
M	HUMKA KAVULA	Interesting. And I don't know what you're talking about.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	During the campaign, Humma -- you said I was stupid.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	This Humma you speak of no longer exists. He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways. He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his devoted followers.
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!
M	ZAPHOD	Thank you.
M	ARTHUR	Why do I get the feeling he's going to get us all killed?
M	FORD	Probably because it's very possible. Just don't save me, okay? We're even. the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the the end of the table. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 HUMMA KAVULA The election is ancient history, Zaphod, but if memory serves -- you won, proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and ability to govern.
M	HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)	And incidently -- you are stupid.
M	ZAPHOD	That's really not the point.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	You haven't come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you here, Zaphod?
M	ZAPHOD	I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea, I ended up here.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	How very, very... ...improbable.
M	HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)	I kept a few souvenirs from my former life. Ah, the heady days of space piracy... so young, so foolish..,
M	HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)	I'll gladly give you the coordinates to Magrathea... ...provided you bring me something in return. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	What?
M	HUMMA KAVULA	A gun.
M	ZAPHOD	A gun?
M	HUMMA KAVULA	A very special gun. Designed by the greatest computer ever invented, now buried in the bowels of Magrathea.
M	ZAPHOD	Fine. I'll get your gun. Just give me the coordinates.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	And what will you give me to insure your return?
M	ZAPHOD	My word as President.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	Ha! I'd be better off with the dung of a Bethusian Mega Donkey.
M	ZAPHOD	Okay, then I'll get you that.
M	HUMMA KAVULA	I need a hostage, something you hold dear. Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	Nooo!!! instruments everywhere. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the words "I'm with Stupid." An arrow points to Zaphod's Head 2 -- which is shouting...
M	ZAPHOD HEAD 2	IDIOT! ZARKING MORON!! COME BACK!! YOU NEED ME!! COME BAAAAACKKKK!!!!
M	HUMMA KAVULA	You should quit while you're "a head" Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the Magrathean defence system alive. blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.
M	ARTHUR	Are we sure this is the right way?
M	FORD	Yes! I think. I don't know. Maybe not.
M	ARTHUR	Yes, thank you for clearing that up.
M	CROWD	Mr. President!...Zaphod, over here!...I want to have your baby!, etc...
M	FORD	Back to the ship. Quickly.
M	VOGON POLICE #1	Mr. President! We are here for your protection! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	KWALTZ	Fire upon the kidnapper!
M	ZAPHOD	Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that's what they want--
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Hey! Let's do lunch! Nice haircut, fella! Hey! Your kids are the same age as mine-- We should get them together some time!
F	QUESTULAR	Commander! The President is the kidnapper!
M	KWALTZ	Cease fire!
M	ARTHUR	Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.
M	FORD	Zaphod, what do we do?
M	ZAPHOD	Build bridges between the stars! He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon.
M	ARTHUR	What?
M	FORD	I think that was his campaign slogan.
F	TRILLIAN	Alright, follow me. She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers
F	QUESTULAR	There they are!
F	TRILLIAN	Back off or I'll kill him, I swear I will!
M	KWALTZ	Could that actually kill him?
M	ADMIRERS	Mr. President, Mr. President!...
M	FEMALE ADMIRER	I totally voted for you!
M	ZAPHOD	Thank you!
M	KWALTZ	Get her!
M	VOGON POLICE	Resistance is useless! move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist.
M	ARTHUR	Tricia!
M	FORD	This way! ARTHUR NO!! TRICIA!!!
M	KWALTZ	Bring her to Vogsphere for processing, Captain.
F	QUESTULAR	They're coming here!? But they've only accomplished half the mission. What about Zaphod? HE MUST FACE JUSTICE!!
M	KWALTZ	My instructions were clear...
M	KWALTZ (CONT'D)	"Apprehend the kidnapper, rescue the president." We do them in that order. And until the kidnapper is properly processed, she isn't officially apprehended, now is she, Mr. Vice- President?
M	ARTHUR	We have to go! Let's GO!
M	ZAPHOD	Right!
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Computer! Take us to Magrathea!
M	ARTHUR	What? No! Follow those ships! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ZAPHOD	Hey -- my third arm. I had one, didn't I?
M	ARTHUR	We have to go after her!
M	EDDIE	Boys, please! Not so rough. You're damaging my joystick.
M	FORD	Who is that?
M	MARVIN	Ghastly, isn't it? I was asked to change the personality type, this was the emergency back-up.
M	EDDIE	How, if you want me to take you somewhere, we're going to have to start using our magic words, "please" and "thank you."
M	ARTHUR	Can you change it back?
M	MARVIN	I can -- but I won't enjoy it.
M	EDDIE	I'm wait-ing...
M	ARTHUR	Ford?
M	FORD	Marvin?
M	MARVIN	Don't look at me. I'm too depressed. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ARTHUR Computer?! Isn't there some kind of manual override switch thing?
M	EDDIE	Yeeessss...
M	ARTHUR	WELL WHERE THE HELL IS IT?!
M	EDDIE	Magic words?
M	ARTHUR	Show me the override switch or I'll reprogram you with a very large axe.
M	EDDIE	I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at.
M	FORD	I think I should push this button.
M	ARTHUR	What's that? What happened?!
M	FORD	A sign lit up saying "Please do not push this button again." HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	Wow...
M	MARVIN	I know. Dreadful, isn't it?
M	ARTHUR	Sorry about the landing. Where are we?
M	ZAPHOD	Magrathea!
M	FORD	Wrong. This is the Vogon planet. This is Vogsphere.
M	ZAPHOD	No. It's Magrathea! I know it!
M	FORD	Little something I learned about on an Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them when they really need to concentrate.
M	ARTHUR	What is it?
M	FORD	A Thinking Cap.
M	MARVIN	This will all end in tears, I just know it.
M	FORD	I checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't." I'm assuming your plan is better. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	Well, I sort of had this idea we could...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Did anyone see that?
M	ZAPHOD	See what?
M	ARTHUR	Nothing.
M	FORD	What was it?
M	ARTHUR	Nothing. Just my imagination.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch me. Something's happening.
M	FORD	Okay. I think we...
M	FORD (CONT'D)	AH!
M	ARTHUR	You, too?
M	FORD	Yes. What was that? I th... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 What do you think, Zaphod?
M	ZAPHOD	I think we should keep going.
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	AAAH!!
M	ARTHUR	What the blazes is that?
M	FORD	I have... an idea.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	Okay, don't think of anything. Don't have ideas or theories -- nothing.
M	ARTHUR	I can't, help it! Trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her.
M	ZAPHOD	I have an idea. (SMACK!) Run!
M	FORD	Ever the politician.
M	ARTHUR	Okay, so... ...not thinking, not thinking, no ideas coming... ...this is by no means an idea that has any merit, but Marvin -- can you give me a hand? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit.
M	ARTHUR	Alright, where is she?
M	VOGON BEHIND COUNTER	Who? The Director of Robot Arm repair? Next building, out the door to the left.
M	ARTHUR	Actually, we're looking for... ...someone you're detaining, perhaps in some form of incarceration...
M	VOGON BEHIND COUNTER	Prisoner Release Department. Six buildings down, out the door, right, left, then two rights. Big gray building, can't miss it.

F	TRILLIAN	No. Tricia Imogene McMillan of Earth.
M	VOGON OFFICER	Sorry. No record of "Earth." HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 TRILLIAN Earth. In the Milky Way? Um...galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.
M	VOGON OFFICER	Right. Here it is. "Earth. Destroyed." Do you have a second home planet?
F	TRILLIAN	Destroyed? No -- that's impossible.
M	VOGON OFFICER	Says here it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway. The order was given...three weeks ago.
F	TRILLIAN	WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND GIVES AN ORDER TO DESTROY A PLANET!?
M	ZAPHOD	He said the gray building, right?
M	ARTHUR	There. That's it. This way. windows. It's packed with all manner of species.
M	ARTHUR	Leave this to me. I'm British. I know how to queue.
F	TRILLIAN	I don't believe you. This is some sort of trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet, especially mine.
M	KWALTZ	These are the orders.
F	TRILLIAN	Love and kisses...?
M	KWALTZ	Now -- according to Section 8, sub-section 34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode to the Removal of Your Left Kidney." Unless -- said kidnapping is of the President, in which case you are to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. We thank you for your cooperation.
M	FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR	Next!
M	ARTHUR	Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a prisoner released?
M	FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR	Prisoner release form? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	Right. Once I've filled it out can I return to the front of the line, seeing as I've already waited...
M	FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR	No. Next!
M	ARTHUR	Can't you do something?! You're President, aren't you?
M	ZAPHOD	You want me to make a speech, shake a hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's all a little fuzzy.
M	FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR	This Prisoner is being detained for... Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for release at this time. You can make an appointment for a later date or take a number and wait.
M	ARTHUR	Alright, look. This is the President.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	He says the whole kidnapping thing was a terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean anything by it and he's ordering you to let her go.
M	FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR	But this isn't a Presidential Release of Prisoner form. Those are blue.
M	FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR (CONT'D)	Okay...
M	VOGON PROCESSOR	Go to the Prisoner Release Lobby, out the door, right, left, 2nd door on the right.
M	KWALTZ	You're free to go. Release her.
F	QUESTULAR	What!? He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go get him!
M	QUESTULAR (CONT'D)	Commander? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
F	TRILLIAN	You bastard. You signed the order to destroy Earth?!
M	ARTHUR	He did?
M	ZAPHOD	I did?
F	TRILLIAN	"Love and kisses, Zaphod?" I saw the form. You didn't even read it, did you?
M	ZAPHOD	Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy. I don't get a lot of time for reading.
F	TRILLIAN	An entire planet, Zaphod. My home. Gone. All because you thought someone wanted your autograph!
M	ZAPHOD	They framed me! It's routine for controlling Presidents!
M	KWALTZ	Cancellation of the Rescue of the President. Now. Get me the Apprehension of the President form.
M	ARTHUR	Trillian...
F	TRILLIAN	You knew. Why didn't you tell me? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ARTHUR I tried. He threatened me.
F	TRILLIAN	Get a backbone, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	What about coming here to rescue you?! That was my brilliant idea!
M	KWALTZ	The President tests my patience. This time, I shall pursue him myself. Ready my ship!
F	QUESTULAR	Yes! This is more like it.
F	QUESTULAR	THIS IS INSANITY!
M	KWALTZ	My license is expired, Mr. Vice President. I can't fly with an expired license -- it's against the law. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 EDDIE Hi, fellas. Hold on to your hats!
M	ZAPHOD	Eddie! Welcome back!
M	FORD	WHAT'S HAPPENING, ZAPHOD?! WHERE DID YOU TELL IT TO GO?!
M	ZAPHOD	I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!
M	FORD	ARE YOU SURE WE REATTACHED THIS THING THE RIGHT WAY?!
M	ZAPHOD	ISN'T IT GREAT?!
M	EDDIE	Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma Z8B530.
M	ZAPHOD	Okay, that's it...I think. Computer? Is that...where are we headed again?
M	FORD	Magrathea?
M	EDDIE	Hang on, fella, and I'll check. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	Look, you're right. You deserved to know and I should've told you. I don't blame you if you're angry.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Right. Anyway...I'm sorry. Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.
M	ZAPHOD	Take us in.
M	ZAPHOD	The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...
M	MARVIN	It's rubbish.
M	GHOSTLY IMAGE	Greetings. This is a recorded announcement as we're all out the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted, kindly do so at the tone. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	Closed? How can a planet be closed?
M	ZAPHOD	For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay, computer. Keep going. Take us down.
M	EDDIE	Happy to!
M	GHOSTLY IMAGE	It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated. As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure on-going quality of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you.
M	EDDIE	Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are two thermonuclear missiles headed right for us. Should I take evasive action?
M	FORD	Um...yes, computer. Evade!
M	EDDIE	There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems. Impact minus 45 seconds. Call me Eddie if it'll help you relax.
M	ARTHUR	Computer! DO SOMETHING!! EDDIE Sure thing, fellah. Handing over manual control. Good luck!
M	ZAPHOD	I can't do this without my other arm!
M	ZAPHOD	Did we lose them?
M	FORD	No. They're right behind us.
M	ARTHUR	Look, why don't I just hit this thing?
M	ZAPHOD	NO! We're here! No telling where it will send us! lid. ZAPHOD NO! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 same place they were - dazed.
M	ZAPHOD	Um...where are we?
F	TRILLIAN	Exactly where we were, I think.
M	ZAPHOD	And the missiles?
M	FORD	Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale.
M	EDDIE	At an improbability factor of eight million, seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to one against.
M	ARTHUR	I could really use a cup of tea.
M	GUIDE VOICE	It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more. This is what it thought as it fell. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Ahhhh!!!! What's happening? Excuse me! Who am I? Hello? Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? What is this 'I' that I want to know what it is? Calm down, get a grip now ... ooh! This is an interesting sensation...
M	WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in ... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite strong now. And hey,what's this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do. Perhaps I can give it a better name later when I've found out what it's for! It must be very important because there certainly seems to be an awful lot of it. Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call it a tail - yeah! Tail!
M	WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to achieve much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on. How. Have I built up a coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind. Hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, ao much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation ... Or is it the wind? There really is an awful lot of that now, isn't there? And hey! What's this thing coming suddenly coming towards me very fast, so big and flat and round it needs a big wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if it'll be friends with me? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GUIDE VOICE	Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was "Oh no, not again."
M	GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)	Many have speculated that if we knew why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.
M	FORD (O.S.)	Hey...this looks familiar.
M	FORD (CONT'D}	Must be portal doors.
M	ARTHUR	You mean -- the hippies were right?
M	ZAPHOD	Okay. In we go. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 What?! Are you out of what's left of your mind? We can't step into that...that.
M	FORD	We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the right one, we come back and pick another. No biggie.
M	ARTHUR	Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the last door we ever step through? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle...thingies.
M	ZAPHOD	It's the right one. I have a hunch.
M	ARTHUR	Ford..?
M	FORD	He's got good hunches. I say we go.
M	ARTHUR	Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?!
M	ZAPHOD	Hey, I think I resent that.
M	ARTHUR	I don't care what you think you think... her ears -- then screams....
F	TRILLIAN	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
M	ZAPHOD	That's supposed to happen...I think. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Hey, wait for me!
M	ARTHUR	No. No! NOOO!!! collapses and buries his head in his hands.
M	MARVIN	I told you this would all end in tears. beside them.
M	ARTHUR	Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?
M	MARVIN	Don't talk to me about life.
M	ARTHUR	Here I am, God knows how far from home...
M	MARVIN	Don't talk to me about God.
M	ARTHUR	...and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at home. Planet called Earth. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	MARVIN	I know. You keep going on about it. It sounds awful.
M	ARTHUR	Oh no, it's beautiful. Or at least, it was...
M	MARVIN	Did it have oceans?
M	ARTHUR	Yes. Great wide rolling blue oceans.
M	MARVIN	Can't bear oceans.
M	ARTHUR	So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet -- with a manically depressed robot.
M	MARVIN	You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (0.S.)	Excuse me.
M	ARTHUR	Aah!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Who are you?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	My name is not important.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)	You must come with me. Terrible events are afoot. You must come or you'll be late.
M	ARTHUR	Late? What for?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	What is your name, Earthman? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ARTHUR Dent. Arthur Dent.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Late as in "the late Dentarthurdent." It's a sort of threat you see. Never been much good at them myself, but I'm told they can be terribly effective.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)	Your friends are safe. You can trust me.
M	ARTHUR	Trust a man who won't tell me his name?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	My name? Very well... My name is...Slartibartfast.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D)	I said it wasn't important.
M	MARVIN	I could calculate your chances of survival -- but you won't like it.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	I must warn you. We are about to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It may disturb you. It scares the willies out of me.
M	ARTHUR	Whaa!
M	MARVIN	Funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse, it suddenly does. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	GHOSTLY IMAGE	This is a recorded announcement as we're all out at the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for...
M	KWALTZ	Turn that off.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	I told you you might find it a bit disturbing.
M	ARTHUR	I have found this whole day a bit disturbing.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Did you know we built planets?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)	Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines was always my favorite. Used to have endless fun doing all the little fiddly bits round fjords. But the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom- built planets are something of a luxury commodity... At any rate, there's been a terrible mix up with your planet. You must come with me or it's all going to blow up in our faces. The best laid plans of mice, you know...
M	ARTHUR	...and men.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Mmmm? What?
M	ARTHUR	The best laid plans of mice and men. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	I don't think men have got much to do with it.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)	Welcome to our factory floor.
M	ZAPHOD	This is it!
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Deep Thought...!
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Shhh. This is a good bit. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ZAPHOD Oh great Deep Thought...we have traveled long...and far. Have you calculated... the Ultimate Question? Of Life, the Universe and Everything?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	No.
M	ZAPHQD	No?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	I've been watching TV.
M	ZAPHOD	Oh...
M	DEEP THOUGHT	I designed another computer to perform that great task.
M	ZAPHOD	Oh, right...I forgot. Is it here?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Not here. Another world.
M	ZAPHOD	It's on another world?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	It is another world. Or was.
M	ZAPHOD	Where?
M	DEEP THOUGHT	Ask your companion.
M	DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)	Not him.
M	ZAPHOD	0kay -- you're sure you don't have the Question? Or a way to you, you know -- access it or something. I think I've done like a lot to get here... HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 DEEP THOUGHT Shhhhhh...
M	DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)	The show's back on.
M	ZAPHOD	Great. This is just great. Let's go find something else for my entire life to be about.
M	FORD	Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We have to get it. You gave the guy your head.
M	ZAPHOD	I know. Why did I do that?
M	FORD	Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have a g... robotic arm pushes it forward. Here. Take it. I don't do guns.
M	ZAPHOD	Thank you. finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has happened.
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Great! This is a bust, too! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	Hey, man, you must be really frustrated. To go through all you did only to come here and get no answer, which means no fame and money, and you deserve that, man. Because you're great -- you're just really, really great.
F	TRILLIAN	Give me that thing. BACK TO: clouds obscure our view.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the boring jobs.
M	ARTHUR	Oh, you had that problem, too?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	In spades. So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face.
M	ARTHUR	What? You did that? I've been there!
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Then I gather you've met some of the inhabitants.
M	ARTHUR	The Vogons?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Relentless blighters. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	MARVIN 99	Life. Loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it.
M	ZAPHOD	...and you're right, I shouldn't be so upset 'cause life goes on and I should just go on with it, right?
F	TRILLIAN	Shoot him again.
M	ZAPHOD	Hitchhiking is good. Towels are good, too.
F	TRILLIAN	Brilliant.
M	FORD	Yeah. I kinda like this.
F	TRILLIAN	A gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view. Useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses, eh?
M	TRILLIAN (CONT'D)	We should get back. Arthur's waiting.
M	ZAPHOD	Who cares?
F	TRILLIAN	I do -- especially since we're both somewhat of an endangered species now. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ZAPHOD Why so edgy?
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who signed the order
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	You actually wanted to know the Question because you always thought there was more to life, and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't.
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	You've got no home, no family, no one to be with -- and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't appreciate you because he's too busy appreciating himself.
M	ZAPHOD (CONT'D)	Give me that thing.
F	TRILLIAN	Won't affect me. I'm already a woman.
M	ZAPHOD	Uh oh -- oh. It's okay, it's only a couple of...
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Here we are, then. Look familiar? HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	ARTHUR	So -- it wasn't destroyed?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Actually, it was. This is a back-up. Earth Mark II.
M	ARTHUR	So you're saying you ... made the Earth?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Well, not me alone. It was a group effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it's called Norway?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)	That was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry to hear about it being blown up. Shocking cock up. The mice were furious.
M	ARTHUR	Mice? Who cares about bloody mice?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Are you a fan of plate tectonics? Voila! Himalayas. Good, eh?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)	Earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built. Ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. But we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back-up copy. And they've brought you with them. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ARTHUR They brought...I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	These creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must've been a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer program...
M	ARTHUR	Ah. I see where you're confused. You see -- we were experimenting on them.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Oh, I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.
M	ARTHUR	So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	That's bureaucracy for you.
M	ARTHUR	Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ...
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that. rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 SLARTIBARTFAST I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired, but I always think that the chances of finding out what's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy than right any day.
M	ARTHUR	And are you?
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	No. That's where it all falls down of course. Here we are, then.
M	ARTHUR	Is this...?
M	TRILLIAN (O.S.)	Arthur!
M	ARTHUR	What -- what are you doing? What happened to you?
M	FORD	attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase Stun Mist (chew, chew) then brought us to this amazing meal as a way to make it up to us (chew, chew). Try the mutton. It's fantastic. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 ZAPHOD Zarking incredible. drugged.
M	ARTHUR	Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea? Now that's a cup of tea.
M	FRANKY MOUSE (O.S.)	We're glad you like it, Earth creature.
M	BENJY MOUSE	After ten million years on Earth, and a rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly humiliating if we didn't know how to make a decent pot of tea.
F	TRILLIAN	Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse and Franky mouse (chew, chew). They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension (chew, chew). I'm sorry, I thought you were told about the mice...
M	ARTHUR	Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it.
M	BENJY MOUSE	Sit, Earthman. Eat.
M	ARTHUR	In a moment, perhaps. I can't seem to let go of this table. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 SLARTIBARTFAST Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be getting back to work now.
M	BENJY MOUSE	That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.
M	ZAPHOD	Smarty fart blast?
M	BENJY/FRANKY	Eat!
M	ZAPHOD	Right.
M	BENJY MOUSE	Earth after all, now that we've found the only living native of the planet.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	But...they've nearly finished the oceans.
M	FRAHKY MOUSE	That will be all, Slartibartfast.
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry, when you say "the only living native" -- do you mean me? What about her?
M	BENJY MOUSE	We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship. She's half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan.
F	TRILLIAN	Which explains a lot.
M	ARTHUR	So -- mostly harmless and me. That's it.
M	BENJY MOUSE	We're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any means necessary. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 FRANKY MOUSE We've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you're here.
M	BENJY MOUSE	Sit, Earthling. Sit. NOT THERE!
M	BENJY MOUSE	This chair is much more -- comfortable.
M	BENJY MOUSE (CONT'D)	Drink.
M	ARTHUR	Mmmm. This really is delicious.
M	BENJY MOUSE	Good. Glad you like it. Now -- to business.
M	FORD/ZAPHOD	To business!
M	ZAPHOD	Sorry. Thought you were proposing a toast.
M	BENJY/FRANKY	EAT!
M	BENJY MOUSE	About this Ultimate Question. You see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FRANKY MOUSE	But - and here's the point - we have to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question.
M	BENJY MOUSE	Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.
M	FRANKY HOUSE	Yes. Got to sound good.
M	ARTHUR	An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show.
M	FRANKY MOUSE	And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea?
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain?
M	BENJY MOUSE	Yes. To extract the question.
M	ARTHUR	You can't have my brain. I'm using it.
M	FRANKY MOUSE	Barely.
M	BENJY MOUSE	We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe.
M	FRANKY MOUSE	A simple one should suffice. Who would know the difference?
M	ARTHUR	I would!
M	FRANKY MOUSE	No, you wouldn't. We could program you not to.
M	ARTHUR	Ford! Zaphod! TRILLIAN!! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 What are they-- what's in the food?! WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!?
M	BENJY MOUSE	Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.
M	ARTHUR	Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING MINUTE!!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	You want the question that goes with the answer "42" How about "What's six times seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one, "How many roads must a man walk down?"
M	BENJY MOUSE	Hey, that's not bad.
M	ARTHUR	Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?
M	BENJY MOUSE	We don't want to be happy. We want to be rich.
M	FRANKY MOUSE	Take his brain. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 their feet.
M	BENJY MOUSE	Shoot him!!
M	FRANKY MOUSE	Oh, shit.
M	ZAPHOD	Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick.
M	MARVIN	I must warn you, I'm feeling very depressed.
M	KWALTZ	Mr. President! We are here for your protection!
M	ZAPHOD	Thank you! HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
M	FORD	Okay -- that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even? Scratch that. Save at will.
F	TRILLIAN	We need that gun.
M	ZAPHOD	We need tighter gun control!
M	FORD	We need his other head. Okay -- I'll create a distraction.
M	ARTHUR	Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.
M	FORD	You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.
M	FORD (CONT'D)	AHHHHHHHH!!!!
F	TRILLIAN	Now!
M	ARTHUR TRILLIAN	I thought I was...what are I thought I was...I'll get you... get back... okay it... you already... fine, fine... fine

M	SLARTIBARTFAST	I've just been informed by some of the lads that since we're so near completion, we're going to go ahead and finish Earth. We can put it back exactly the way it was when you left, you know -- unless there's anything you'd like to change. Something you think your planet could do without?
M	ARTHUR	Yes. Me.
F	TRILLIAN	Let's go somewhere.
M	ARTHUR	Yes, You name it. I'll go.
M	ZAPHOD	I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.
M	FORD	And I'm hungry. After we get your head let's grab a bite. I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe.
M	SLARTIBARTFAST	Okay. Hold tight.
