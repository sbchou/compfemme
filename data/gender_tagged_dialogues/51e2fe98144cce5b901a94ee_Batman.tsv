M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MOM	For God's sake, Harold, can we please just get a taxi??
M	DAD	I'm trying to get a -- TAXI!!
M	JIMMY	We're going the wrong way.
M	DAD	Put that away. We'll look like tourists.
M	DAD (cont.)	We'll never get a cab here. Let's cut over to Seventh.
M	JIMMY	Seventh is that way.
M	DAD	I know where we are!
M	VOICE	Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?
M	DERELICT	Mister. How about it. One dollar? One dollar, man. Are you deaf? Are you deaf? -- Do you speak English??
M	STREET PUNK	Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't scream.
M	NICK	All right. The Gold Card. Don't leave home without it.
M	EDDIE	Let's beat it, man. I don't like being up here.
M	NICK	What, scared of heights?
M	EDDIE	I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny Gobs --
M	NICK	Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? No big loss.
M	EDDIE	That ain't what I heard. That ain't what I heard at all. I heard the bat got him.
M	NICK	Gimme a break, will you? Shut up...
M	EDDIE	Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
M	NICK	No shit. It was all over the pavement.
M	EDDIE	There was no blood, man. My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
M	NICK	Listen to this. How old are you? There ain't no bat.
M	EDDIE	My brother's a priest, man.
M	NICK	No wonder you're such a chickenshit. Now shut up. There ain't no bat.
M	EDDIE	You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
M	NICK	Do you want this money or don't you? Now shut up! Shut up -- I'm gettin' outta here. Don't kill me... don't kill me...
M	BATMAN	I won't kill you. I want you to do me a favor.
M	BATMAN (cont.)	Tell your friends. Tell all your friends.
M	DENT	... it is no longer enough to go after the small-time punks and petty criminals who infest the streets of Gotham City. Crime and corruption must be attacked at the root! If elected, my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against Boss Carl Grissom!
M	DENT	Together we can make Gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play.
M	JACK NAPIER	Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace else.
F	ALICIA	Anything new?
M	JACK	The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom... I would've had to kill him by now.
F	ALICIA	If Grissom knew about us... he might kill you.
M	JACK	Don't think so, angel. I'm too valuable. That's the way I've planned it. And besides, he doesn't know.
F	ALICIA	You look just fine, Jack.
M	JACK	... I didn't ask.
M	MEDIC	That one there won't say a word. The other one's raving his head off.
M	ECKHARDT	Variety, huh? The spice of life.
M	PATROLMAN	They found him hugging a drainpipe. He was scared to come off the roof.
M	KNOX	Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week.
M	PATROLMAN	I dunno. What's "what"?
M	KNOX	Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation.
M	ECKHARDT	Oh Christ, it's Knox.
M	KNOX	Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about?
M	ECKHARDT	Nothing out of the routine.
M	NICK	A bat, I tell you, a giant bat! He wanted me to do him a favor...!
M	KNOX	No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing something up there.
M	ECKHARDT	No comment. Print what you like.
M	KNOX	Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City?
M	KNOX (cont.)	If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after taxes?
M	JACK	You didn't show up.
M	ECKHARDT	We had another bat sighting.
M	JACK	I'm sure that was vitally important. Listen: things are heating up. Someone is leaking information to Harvey Dent.
M	ECKHARDT	I'm doing the best I can. If it's a problem --
M	JACK	Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
M	ECKHARDT	I'll work on it.
M	JACK	Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think?
M	ECKHARDT	I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you.
M	JACK	You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future.
M	ECKHARDT	Ambition. Forget it, Jack. You'll never run that organization.
M	JACK	And why's that?
M	ECKHARDT	You're a psycho, friend. You're an A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows it.
M	JACK	Here. Use mine.
M	JACK (cont.)	It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt here is a good cop. A real good cop. Inexpensive.
M	KNOX	What have you got for me, Jerry? Nice, but... maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh?
M	COLLEAGUE	Hey Knox, you got a visitor.
M	KNOX	I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and dust him, okay?
M	COLLEAGUE	This one you might want to dust yourself.
M	KNOX	... Vicki Vale.
F	VICKI	How'd you know it was me?
M	KNOX	Honey -- I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.
M	KNOX (cont.)	Where the hell have you been?
F	VICKI	A nice, restful vacation.
M	KNOX	God, a girl could get hurt doing this.
F	VICKI	I do get hurt.
M	KNOX	Got any more of those?
F	VICKI	Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal here. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
M	KNOX	It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
F	VICKI	Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
M	KNOX	Small so far. I mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they.
F	VICKI	Speaking of which... I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.
M	KNOX	Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there. Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --
M	KNOX (cont.)	Aw, Vicki. Vicki! Got a date?
M	KNOX (cont.)	Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always loved you. Will you marry me?
F	VICKI	No.
M	KNOX	Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
F	VICKI	Yes, but please -- be gentle.
M	GRISSOM	Nine points ahead in the new poll. I don't like the way this is shaping up.
M	JACK	We can always pop him. -- Or pop someone close to him.
M	LIEUTENANT	Let's feed him to the bat.
M	GRISSOM	He's going after our front companies. Specifically Ace Chemical. Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane, Senator Miller... on up the line. We have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down.
M	LIEUTENANT	How do we go? The usual fire?
M	GRISSOM	I'm thinking break-in. Trash the office, remove the relevant documents...
M	JACK	"Industrial espionage."
M	GRISSOM	That's right. And Jack -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
M	JACK	... Me?
M	GRISSOM	Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room. Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
M	GRISSOM	Because I want someone I can trust. We'll work out the details later. But it's got to be soon. -- All right, that's all for now. You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an important job. I can't trust it to somebody who'll screw up.
M	JACK	I understand.
M	GRISSOM	Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.
M	GRISSOM (cont.)	My friend, your luck is just about to change. Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.
M	KNOX	How high up would you say that is?
M	ALFRED	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
M	KNOX	You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
M	ALFRED	Which bathroom is that, air?
M	KNOX	The small one. Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people?
F	VICKI	Some. I am a rich bitch, remember. I'm quoting.
M	KNOX	Yeah, I guess we move in different circles. -- Though I did meet a one-eyed pimp last week.
M	KNOX	Commissioner Gordon! What do you hear from our pointy-eared friend?
M	GORDON	Knox, for the ninth time, and you can quote me -- there is no bat.
M	KNOX	Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be one honest cop in Gotham city.
M	DENT	How's your luck, Jim?
M	KNOX	Mr. Dent. What's your stand on winged vigilantes?
M	DENT	Mr. Knox, I think we have enough real problems in this city without worrying about ghosts and goblins and Halloween characters.
M	KNOX	My question is, where does one man get all this junk.
F	VICKI	All over the world. They say he spends most of the year overseas -- until recently, anyway.
M	KNOX	Holy shit... ... We found the arsenal.
M	KNOX (cont.)	This guy has just gotten interesting. What else do you know?
F	VICKI	Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.
M	KNOX	Likes to kill?
F	VICKI	Women find him magnetic.
M	KNOX	I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
F	VICKI	That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
M	KNOX	Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
M	BRUCE WAYNE	You disappoint me. Why not the world?
M	KNOX	I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. Alexander Knox.
M	BRUCE	Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it.
M	KNOX	Great. Give me a grant.
M	BRUCE	I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
M	KNOX	"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
M	BRUCE	You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you.
F	VICKI	That's intriguing. They haven't been published yet.
M	BRUCE	... You have an extraordinary eye.
M	KNOX	Some people think she has two.
F	VICKI	Don't mind my friend. He's a little nervous tonight. This is an amazing house. I'd love to shoot it sometime.
M	BRUCE	I don't... seek publicity. -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
F	VICKI	As far as I know.
M	BRUCE	Good. Then with any luck we'll run into each other.
M	ALFRED	Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave -- very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets.
M	BRUCE	Thank you, Alfred. I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. And you.
M	KNOX	I know the rich are different, but that guy is real different.
M	KNOX (cont.)	Hello? Vicki?
F	VICKI	Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.
M	KNOX	What were you thinking?
F	VICKI	Yum, yum.
M	KNOX	Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room.
F	VICKI	I get it. Bruce Vain.
M	PATROLMAN	... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace Chemical Company.
M	GORDON	Good Lord, it we could put our hands on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told about this? Who's in charge of the --
M	PATROLMAN	Lt. Eckhardt, sir.
M	GORDON	Eckhardt. Oh my God...
M	ECKHARDT	Shoot to kill.
M	SAFECRACKER	... Empty.
M	HOOD I	Just like the file cabinets.
M	HOOD II	I don't get it. If this place is cleaned out already, what do we need five men?
M	ECKHARDT	What are you trying to do, blow the collar?
M	GORDON	You men are dismissed. We'll take over from here. Any man who opens fire on Jack Napier... will answer to me.
M	GORDON (cont.)	You. Stick around.
M	COP	Freeze!
M	ECKHARDT	Nice work, Commissioner.
M	GORDON	I'm in charge here. Not Carl Grissom.
M	COP	LOOK!
M	GORDON	My God... it's him.
M	VOICE	HOLD IT!
M	HOOD V	Let him go or I'll do it.
M	HOOD V	Nobody makes a move. We go out clean.
M	JACK'S VOICE	ECKHARDT!!
M	GORDON	NO!! Goddammit, we had him. We -- Hold it right there, Mister.
M	COP	LOOK!
M	GORDON	HOLD YOUR FIRE!
M	COP	... Who is this guy?
M	GORDON	I don't know, but he's one hell of a showman.
M	KNOX	Commissioner. Do us both a favor. Don't tell me some lie you'll have to retract later. Vick! Looks like our friend the bat is getting ambitious. -- Why the dopey grin?
F	VICKI	Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne.
M	KNOX	Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked you for a date?... Shit. HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE! I want you to pay close attention to this. Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
M	MIRANDA	You mean Mister One-Nighter?
M	KNOX	Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter." Because that's the average length of his relationships with women.
M	MIRANDA	The current record is almost two weeks. That cover girl -- what's her name? You must've shot her, Vicki --
M	KNOX	Tell her about the peanuts.
F	VICKI	Peanuts?
M	KNOX	Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women.
M	MIRANDA	Like Planter's Peanuts.
F	VICKI	Plain or roasted? Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
M	KNOX	Why? Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious. I do this for a living. -- What'd you tell him?
F	VICKI	I told him yes.
M	VICKI (cont.)	You're awfully sweet to be concerned, but it's really not necessary. I'll call you, okay?
M	KNOX	... What was that?
M	MIRANDA	That was one of the most gracious fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure to watch. -- What a nice girl.
M	KNOX	Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.
F	VICKI	Do you sail?
M	BRUCE	Too much work. I'm not really the physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.
F	VICKI	You do a very convincing imitation. Mm, this is tasty. What's yours? ... Ginger ale?
M	BRUCE	Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. Tell me, Vicki. There's something I'm very curious about. What took you down to Corto Maltese?
F	VICKI	... I guess I needed a change.
M	BRUCE	You were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city. Everyone wanted you.
F	VICKI	Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?
M	BRUCE	Not since the shooting started.
F	VICKI	We went there once when I was little. I played on the beach. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced with my father on the hotel patio. That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
M	BRUCE	What did you see?
F	VICKI	... Terror.
M	BRUCE	There's terror everywhere. Some types are just more -- familiar than others.
F	VICKI	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I know it all seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this --
M	BRUCE	Insulation?
F	VICKI	Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
M	BRUCE	I think you see things very clearly.
F	VICKI	I'm happy to talk about something else. I don't want to be depressing.
M	BRUCE	Do you assume that if I know you better I won't like you as much?
F	VICKI	I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are you like this with the other women you know? -- Because I just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
M	BRUCE	Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
F	VICKI	-- but it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even --
M	BRUCE	Would you like me to take you home?
F	VICKI	God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.
M	BRUCE	Maybe we should just kiss.
F	VICKI	... We could try that.
M	DOCTOR	Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we did.
M	JACK (V.O.)	Mirror.
M	JACK (V.O.)	Mirror.
M	DOCTOR	You understand the facial muscles were completely severed -- -- you can see what I have to work with here --
M	DOCTOR (cont.)	I'm sure that with proper recon-- recon-- reconstructive surgery --
M	KID	Nice hair, dude!
M	GRISSOM (O.S.)	That you, sugar bumps? Who the hell are you?
M	JACK	It's me. "Sugar Bumps."
M	GRISSOM	Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been --
M	JACK	Is that what you "heard"? YOU SET ME UP! Over a girl. You must be insane! Keep your hands on the desk.
M	GRISSOM	Sooner or later you would've tried to take me, Jack. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
M	JACK	I've died once already. It wasn't so bad. -- In fact I recommend it.
M	GRISSOM	Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
M	JACK	JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?? I'm not a Jack any more. You made me a Joker!
M	GRISSOM	Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
M	JACK	HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!! What a view. Our little city. It always brings a smile to my face. Guess it's my little city now. get done with it. I bet it'll be something real fine. Real fine and pretty.
F	VICKI	I didn't mean to scare you. I just had to come in here and see it that was really you singing.
M	VICKI (cont.)	"Don't buy sugar -- you just have to touch my cup." Come on. "You're my sugar --" Bruce, you are such a case.
M	BRUCE	I don't sing very well.
F	VICKI	Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is. -- Now you'll have to kill me.
M	VICKI (cont.)	Poor thing. You should stay off that horse.
M	KNOX	...Peanut.
M	COPY BOY	Here's that morgue file you wanted.
M	KNOX	Come on. Gimme some dirt!
M	KNOX (cont.)	... Why don't you like your picture taken?
M	DOORMAN	Miss Hunt! No need to sneak in. The rent's been taken care of.
F	ALICIA	... The rent? Paid?
M	VOICE	Honey -- I'm home!
M	JOKER (O.S.)	So that's how it is, gents. Until Grissom decides it's safe to come up for air... I'm running the show.
M	GANG BOSS	So why don't we hear this from Grissom?
M	RACKETEER	I got something I'd like to know. How come you're wearing that stupid smirk?
M	JOKER	'Cause I got an army, chum. And I got Grissom's army. And this city is mine.
M	ROTELLI	I don't like taking orders, from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
M	JOKER	I've considered that possibility.
M	ROTELLI	And what happens if we say no?
M	JOKER	Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
M	ROTELLI	That's it?
M	JOKER	That's it. Looks like Carmine got a little hot under the collar.
M	CRIMELORD	... You're insane!
M	JOKER	That's what they said about Lee Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And THINK IT OVER!
M	JOKER (cont.)	Heck, they're not such bad guys. I say we give 'em a couple of days to come around. We-e-ll... maybe one day. Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.
F	VICKI	... To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
M	BRUCE	I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did. -- And here we are.
F	VICKI	Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.
M	BRUCE	Vicki. Do you want the whole truth? All coyness aside? I wish I had more time to give you. Every day I don't see you, I miss you. Now. Are you going to waste this lovely afternoon being all mad at me?
F	VICKI	Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so much like someone I used to... Bruce? I know this is silly, but -- you're not married, are you?
F	VICKI	All street mimes should be executed.
M	BRUCE	... Looks like a convention.
F	VICKI	BRUCE!!
M	BRUCE	Oh my God... are you all right?
M	ANCHORWOMAN	... live from Halliday Plaza, where a gangland-style execution claimed the life of racketeer Philly Ricorso. Ricorso's death is the third in a rash of underworld killings...
M	ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)	Commissioner, you've heard the rumors. Are these murders the work of the mysterious 'Batman'?
M	JOKER	All reet! I think it's about time we called another meeting, huh?
M	ALFRED	I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him your messages. That's all I can do.
F	VICKI	Please tell him... I'm not trying to make his life difficult. I'd just -- I'd just like to know what's going on.
M	KNOX	Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd like you to see.
M	KNOX	Okay, here we go. Check it out.
M	THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED	Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed
F	VICKI	Oh my God... I've seen this picture.
M	KNOX	I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
F	VICKI	His face. Allie, look at his face.
M	KNOX	Yep. He watched the whole thing happen. -- Recognize the beat cop? Jim Gordon.
F	VICKI	Oh, Bruce...
M	KNOX	Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
F	VICKI	Alexander, you are on drugs.
M	KNOX	He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, the Caped Crusader turns up in full bat-drag. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to change. Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all right.
F	VICKI	You're pissing me off, Allie. I know exactly why you're doing this.
M	KNOX	Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
F	VICKI	He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know.
M	KNOX	... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession to make. I'm the Batman. Don't believe me? Why not?
F	VICKI	Alexander... I know you.
M	KNOX	Right. And they know him. And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
F	VICKI	This is pointless. I'm leaving.
M	KNOX	Your little chum is out of his mind. Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night -- think it over.
M	JOKER	How's that first shipment coming?
M	VOICE ON PHONE	Right on schedule. Oh, we got that address for you -- 79 East End, #12-C.
M	JOKER	Mmm. How'd you find it?
M	VOICE ON PHONE	Called her agent.
M	CLAIRE	... of course, after Corto Maltese, this must all seem pretty tame.
F	VICKI	Not to me. I need a job.
M	CLAIRE	Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.
F	VICKI	Then "everyone" must know something I don't.
M	CLAIRE	Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on, dear, Tony's dying to see you.
M	TONY	Yes, ladies, smiles, show me those smiles, fabulous, tropical smiles, think Tahiti, I want to see teeth, yes, those glorious teeth --
M	TONY (cont.)	My God no, don't stop now, those smiles, I need those smiles -- Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's -- No! Too far, too far! Pull back, pull back! OH MY GOD!
M	PATSY	The fashion world was stunned today by the sudden deaths of top models Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg. Cause of death has been attributed to a violent allergic reaction, although authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of drug use. Dave?
M	DAVE	In Gotham, plans continue for the city's 300th birthday celebration. The four-day event will conclude with the unveiling, in Gotham Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady Gotham'... This bulletin just in. Nine more mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor in --
M	DAVE (cont.)	Patsy! This is hardly the -- PATSY!! KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --
M	MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)	... Love that Joker!
M	DIRECTOR	WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?? I DON'T KNOW!
M	JOKER	... new improved Joker brand. With the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL! Let's go to our blind taste test. Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of sorts. He's been using Brand X! But with new improved Joker brand... ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!
M	JOKER (cont.)	-- and the world smiles with you! Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --
M	JOKER	I know what you're saying. Where can I buy these fine, fine products? Well, that's the gag, folks, you never know. Chances are... you've bought 'em already!!!
M	ALFRED	... Sir!
M	JOKER	Baby's got a tummyache? Here's something that'll fix him quick!
M	JOKER (cont.)	Now on your grocer's shelf. So remember -- use Joker brand -- and put on a happy face!!
M	PANIC GRIPS GOTHAM	Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?
M	ANCHORWOMAN	... sixteen new deaths, with no clues as to the Joker's identity or demands. The list at potentially lethal products now includes: perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --
M	ANCHORMAN	Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash -- underarm deodorant --
M	ANCHORWOMAN	Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil -- moisturizing cream --
M	VOICE	She's outside the Fluegelheim.
F	ALICIA	Jack? Who was that?
M	JOKER	Get dressed. We're going out.
F	VICKI	I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?
M	MAITRE D'	No, but your table is ready.
M	WAITER	Miss Vale, this just arrived for you. PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.
M	JOKER	Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.
M	JOKER (cont.)	I kinda like this one. Leave it.
M	JOKER	I think it's safe to take that off.
M	JOKER (cont.)	You're quite beautiful.
F	VICKI	... Thank you.
M	JOKER	Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
M	JOKER (cont.)	You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know who I am. -- Is this your portfolio?
M	JOKER (cont.)	Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye. The panic. The bloody skulls. The armless screaming fellows... you know, the atrocities. Somehow, when you shoot it, it all comes out so clean, so lovely.
M	JOKER (cont.)	I guess I'm just an old cornball, but... I live for beauty. I look around at my little city, it gets me down. We don't have anything like this. Well, it came to me that what this city needs... is beautification. Kind of a big makeover. Miss Vale, I finally realized that one man can make a difference. You know the saying. "In his image... created he them"?
F	VICKI	And you want a --
M	JOKER	A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. This could make your reputation.
F	VICKI	Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
M	JOKER	... Behind the makeup? Oh. Yes. I see what you mean. Silly little TWIT -- I can't take you ANYWHERE! Well? What are you waiting for??
M	JOKER (cont.)	You see, Miss Vale -- that was my makeup. What do you think?
F	VICKI	I've seen worse. Much worse.
M	JOKER	Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman. -- Maybe we can do business after all.
M	VOICE	Jack?
M	JOKER	Christ, it's my girlfriend. WHAT?
F	ALICIA	You said I could look at the pictures before you -- before you --
M	JOKER	Shucks, honey, I forgot. I'm in trouble now. This is business, sweetie. Why don't you go outside and see how the boys are coming?
F	VICKI	... Why the mask?
M	JOKER	Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
M	JOKER (cont.)	You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful. One in a million. A work of art. In fact...
M	JOKER (cont.)	She makes you look sick.
F	VICKI	You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
M	JOKER	What? I improved her a little...
F	VICKI	I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead. -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
M	JOKER	Miss Vale, was it something I said? Do you want to sniff my flower?
F	VICKI	NO!
M	JOKER	Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL THE ROSES!! ... YOU!! GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!! GET IN THE CAR!
F	VICKI	WHICH CAR? ... Oh.
M	BATMAN	Ignition!
M	COMPUTER	Ignition.
M	JOKER	I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!
F	VICKI	Look! Police!
M	BATMAN	I called them.
F	VICKI	Shouldn't we --
M	GOON	There they are! Dead ahead!
M	JOKER	ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!
F	VICKI	What about her? What about the girl?
M	BATMAN	He won't kill her. GODDAMMIT!
F	VICKI	Can't we --
M	BATMAN	Too many people. Come on! SHIELDS!!
M	COMPUTER	Shields.
M	GOON AT WHEEL	Are they ours?
M	JOKER	... I don't know. We'd better get out of here. Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??
M	GOON I	We got 'em! Take 'em! I want his head!
M	BATMAN	How much do you weigh?
F	VICKI	... A hundred and eight?
M	BATMAN	HANG ON! Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!
M	GOON I	... No blood.
M	GOON II	Jesus.
M	GOON III	Wait a minute.
M	GOON IV	... What is that?
M	GOON III	Some kind of body armor.
M	GOON I	He's human after all. -- Take that mask off.
M	GOON I	Well?... Who is this guy?
M	GOON II	I dunno. You seen him before?
M	GOON III	Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.
M	GOON IV	Good idea. Let's check his wallet.
M	GOON I	We'll worry about it later. Plug him. In the head.
M	GOON III	Goddam, it's the redhead!
M	GOON II	Did you hit her?
M	GOON I	Who cares? Wax that freak.
M	BATMAN	... Not even a 'thank you'?
F	VICKI	Well -- I think you might consider thanking me. You were good as dead.
M	BATMAN	That's because you lied about your weight. Thank you.
M	BATMAN (cont.)	I'll have to ask you for that film.
F	VICKI	I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
M	BATMAN	Please.
F	VICKI	I won't let you have it.
M	VICKI (cont.)	I know you can break my neck and take it. But the Joker's on that same roll. I --
M	BATMAN	The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
F	VICKI	Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
M	BATMAN	All right, here's a compromise. I'll develop the photos. You keep the Jokers and I'll keep the rest.
F	VICKI	How do I know you won't keep them all?
M	BATMAN	Because I'll take you with me.
M	BATMAN (cont.)	Thank you, Vicki.
F	VICKI	... Where are you going to take me?
M	BATMAN	Shields open.
M	COMPUTER	Shields open.
M	BATMAN (V.O.)	Ignition.
M	COMPUTER	Ignition.
M	COP	There's somebody in there!
M	BATMAN	STOP!
F	VICKI	... How long have I been out?
M	BATMAN	Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
F	VICKI	Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. What's that?
M	BATMAN	Garage door.
F	VICKI	I meant to ask you. Up on the roof -- how did you know my name? I'm serious. How did you know?
F	VICKI	What is this stuff? Kevlar?
M	BATMAN	Better. It's not on the market yet.
F	VICKI	It doesn't protect your head, though.
M	BATMAN	That's why I wear a target on my chest.
F	VICKI	How'd you find this place?
M	BATMAN	Stumbled across it when I was a boy.
M	BATMAN (cont.)	They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
F	VICKI	I don't like bats. Not that kind.
M	BATMAN	They used to terrify me. But I forced myself to keep coming back, and -- -- I guess I became the thing I feared the most. I'll do your photos now.
F	VICKI	Who pays for all this?
M	BATMAN	I have sponsors.
F	VICKI	The computers?
M	BATMAN	I'm running a check on the tainted products. There is a pattern. Beauty products. Personal hygiene.
F	VICKI	No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll all be showing our true faces now.
M	BATMAN	I've tracked all the records. Every shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. Nothing. No opportunities for tampering. Somehow the Joker is supplying tainted ingredients... at the source.
F	VICKI	Wait. You can just tap into any corporate database you want? Anywhere?
M	BATMAN	Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos are ready.
F	VICKI	You could've killed him, you know. You could have killed the Joker.
M	BATMAN	I had to save you, Vicki. Here you go. I think I'll let you keep the whole set.
M	BATMAN (cont.)	Care for an autograph?
F	VICKI	... Bruce?
M	BATMAN	Are you talking to me?
M	BATMAN (cont.)	Maybe we've had enough for one night. I'll take you home. Do you want to do it this time?
M	BATMAN (cont.)	Don't be afraid. I'm here.
M	BRUCE (V.O.)	Vicki... ?
M	BRUCE	Vicki, I've been thinking about you. I know it's late. I'm sorry. I -- Are you there?
F	VICKI	Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
M	BRUCE	I'm sorry about the way things went between us. I'd very much like to see you again.
F	VICKI	Well, Bruce... I don't think... that would be possible.
M	BRUCE	I wish you'd reconsider. I didn't stand you up today. The museum was closed when I got there.
F	VICKI	I, uh...
M	BRUCE (V.O.)	Vicki? Vi --
M	KNOX	Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're telling me -- the car, the equipment -- somebody's paying for it.
F	VICKI	I just can't --
M	KNOX	The FBI. You know who's got the FBI computer contract? Wayne Technologies. The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. This is gonna be the most incredible --
F	VICKI	But he's not.
M	KNOX	Not what?
F	VICKI	He's not crazy.
M	KNOX	Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope. Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.
F	VICKI	Allie... he wants to tell me. That's why he took me there. Because he's trying to tell me.
M	KNOX	Gimme a break. If he wants to chat, he can talk to his car.
F	VICKI	He has to tell someone. And I'm the one. He's trying to tell me.
M	KNOX	Well, when he does you know my number.
M	WAR OF THE FREAKS	Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout Product Scare Drops Dow to 1100 Biggest One-Day Decline in History
M	BRUCE	Don't sell. It won't last. We'll ride it out.
M	WAILING COLLEAGUE	... a nine-million-dollar bath!
M	BRUCE	Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
F	VICKI	... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it.
M	BRUCE	Who's this "Bruce"? Are you trying to make me jealous?
M	VICKI (V.O.)	I'm serious, Bruce. We have to --
M	FINANCIER	Hi, Bruce.
M	DENT	... We deal.
M	ADVISER	Harvey, please. I mean -- If your first official act as D.A. is to cut a deal with a terrorist...
M	DENT	Screw that, Ed. We've got a market panic of national proportions. -- We've got 786 people dead. I won't sacrifice one more life for the sake of appearing strong.
M	POLITICO	Harvey's right. We've got the 300th anniversary gala coming up. The networks won't even send in a crew.
M	ADVISER	Harvey, the police are working round the clock, the feds are coming in. This thing could break any minute now. Tell him, Jim.
M	GORDON	Cut the deal.
M	NEWS ANCHOR	... at City Hall, where the mayor is waiting to open negotiations with the clown-faced terrorist known as the Joker. It is now eight minutes past the appointed deadline, and still no word from --
M	REPORTER I	Look at 'em sweat. Can't wait for the next Gallup Poll.
M	REPORTER II	Hey Knox, cheer up. It ain't the Batman but it's pretty choice.
M	JOKER	Joker here. Can we talk?
M	MAYOR	"While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace."
M	JOKER	Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
M	JOKER (cont.)	But I'm a reasonable fella. If you want to make me an offer...
M	MAYOR	All right, all right. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
M	JOKER	Ten million dollars. Ten million dollars. Ten mi-- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions! I want ten million and one.
M	MAYOR	No, wait, please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
M	JOKER	Goddammit, I expect to be treated like an ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
M	JOKER (cont.)	I might just think up some demands. And I'm gonna talk to all my friends, and see what they want, too. And then maybe we'll get together -- have a little party -- exchange presents. Happy Birthday, Gotham.
M	ALFRED (V.O.)	Yes?
M	KNOX	Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
M	ALFRED (V.O.)	Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
M	KNOX	Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
M	BRUCE	I've been expecting to hear from you.
M	KNOX	Well, that's how it is, chum. She tells me everything.
M	BRUCE	What is it you want?
M	KNOX	Simple. You know the score. One column -- and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets once and for all. I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
M	BRUCE	I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still out there.
M	KNOX	Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word. See, I don't know how it happened -- she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but she's in love with you.
M	BRUCE	There's something I don't understand. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
M	KNOX	Because I -- Because she'd never speak to me again.
M	KNOX (cont.)	Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What have you got to offer? You gonna marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman? Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be Best Rodent?
M	BRUCE	Do you want a drink?
M	KNOX	Yeah, a drink. "Civilized." Man-to- man, right?
M	BRUCE	Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox. -- I'll have one too.
F	VICKI	... So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
M	BRUCE	It wouldn't matter much.
F	VICKI	I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
M	BRUCE	Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself. -- I'm extraneous to the process.
F	VICKI	You're one man. You can't save everybody.
M	BRUCE	What it I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
F	VICKI	Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
M	BRUCE	Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
F	VICKI	Oh, God. I've got to have some coffee or something.
M	BRUCE	Are you expecting anyone? Who's there?
M	DELIVERY BOY	Package tor Miss Vale.
M	BRUCE	Set it down by the door. On the left-hand side.
F	VICKI	BRUCE!
M	VICKI (cont.)	It's just like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
M	BRUCE	Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
F	VICKI	Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
M	BRUCE	I feel naked without it.
M	BRUCE (cont.)	Not a bomb. But it could be rigged. Wait in the next room.
M	BRUCE	... They're wax.
F	VICKI	"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.
M	BRUCE	That does it. It's going to be this weekend.
F	ALICIA	I thought you ought to know -- he's coming for you...
M	BRUCE	Keep her on the line!
F	VICKI	... Where are you calling from?
F	VICKI	I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
M	BRUCE	Finding out where she is.
F	VICKI	How can you do that if she's already off the line?
M	BRUCE	I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
M	BRUCE	Got it!
F	VICKI	What now!
M	BRUCE	Hang on. I have to leave a message.
M	THUG I	Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have to --
M	BRUCE	There's a garage in this building? I've got to take him out now.
M	BRUCE (cont.)	Pick an apartment and stay there. And listen: call the police. Give them that address. Every available man.
M	BRUCE	Oh, hell!
M	GOON	Hey, boss, something's up. The elevator's working.
M	JOKER	DAMMIT! You can't get good help these days. -- Let's move out.
M	JOKER	Slow down, you maniac!
M	DRIVER	Boss! Jesus! They've --
M	JOKER	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!
M	JOKER	MOVE! Can't you do something??
M	DRIVER	It's some kind of detour. They're backed up for blocks!
M	JOKER	Oh my God. How does he do it... ?
M	EMCEE	-- the most spectacular, most death- defying aerial stunt ever devised. Tonight -- for the first time anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!
M	PILOT	Ready to go, Dick?
M	DICK	What's all the ruckus down there?
M	JOKER	Head for the truck!
M	JOKER	I love fireworks!
M	DICK	NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!
M	DICK	LET ME GO! LET ME -- YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--
M	JOKER	Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot. Hands off the belt.
M	BATMAN	Take me. Let the boy go.
M	JOKER	Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And I'd be real, real sad if you couldn't make it.
M	BATMAN	What are you talking about?
M	JOKER	Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... You made me what I am today.
M	DICK	HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED MY --
M	REPORTER	... on a tip attributed to the mysterious Batman. The apartment was booby-trapped with the Joker's laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen dead. Also found dead at the scene was Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --
M	DICK	... Where am I?
M	BRUCE	My name is Bruce Wayne. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.
M	DENT	We'll send a team into Ace the moment the warrant comes through.
M	BRUCE	He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
M	DENT	All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
M	BRUCE	I suggest a nice big bomb.
M	DENT	Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.
M	BRUCE	Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
M	DENT	We've told him we'll deal. What could he possibly have to gain by --
M	BRUCE	Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
M	DENT	I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all your expert sources.
M	DICK	... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride so I figured I'd hoof it.
M	BRUCE	Sorry. I can't let you leave.
M	DICK	You can't keep me here, man. That's kidnapping.
M	BRUCE	If I let you leave, you'll do the same thing again. You'll go after the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
M	DICK	Hey, man. Look at you. You're rich. You got everything you want. How do you know what's in my mind?
M	BRUCE	I don't care what's in your mind. You're staying.
M	DICK	... You're him.
M	ALFRED (V.O.)	FREEZE!
M	BRUCE	It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
M	ALFRED	... Very good, sir.
M	JOKER	Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs, I'm here to tell you... we have had one helluva quarter. Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear -- fear's gone straight through the roof. You guys should be proud -- 'cause I couldn'ta done it without each and every one of you!
M	JOKER (cont.)	I feel it's time to expand the Joker line. I was askin' myself, what are the products that every consumer wants most? And that's when it hit me: the water you drink, and the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo! Now, some of you have your eye on the profit margin. You're thinkin': this boy's too ambitious. You don't approve. In fact, some of you have been talking about turning me in to the cops. Or knocking me off. But that's okay. I understand. Not everyone shares my eye for beauty. And just to show there's no hard feelings, I'm throwin' a little shindig tonight -- and you're all invited! How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??
M	JOKER	Look at that, folks. We got 'em rolling in the aisles!
M	BRUCE	All this apparatus, Vicki... this house, and the money, and the power... it was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
F	VICKI	I'm not frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
M	BRUCE	In all these years... why couldn't I see how it would turn out?
M	BRUCE (cont.)	I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't for me, there'd be no Joker.
M	BRUCE	Where's the boy?
M	ALFRED	Upstairs. He's quite docile.
M	BRUCE	I know that feeling. It won't last. He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age. I want you to treat him just as if he were me. Promise.
M	ALFRED	Yes, sir.
M	BRUCE	He'll be taken care of financially. Beyond that... you know what to do. Don't let all this go to waste. Alfred? -- Thank you.
M	DISPATCHER	Boston, Philly: loading bay one.
M	COMPUTER	... Detonate.
M	COP	Good Lord!
M	GOVERNOR GILROY	As Governor of this great state, it is now my honor to unveil for you a very special lady -- a lady who stands tall for life and liberty -- America's favorite lady... LADY GOTHAM! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a little token of my esteem. HAVE FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!
M	KNOX	VICKI!
M	KNOX (cont.)	Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
F	VICKI	Yeah. Deja vu.
M	KNOX	What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
M	KNOX	So much for Underdog.
F	VICKI	ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!
M	KNOX	WHAT HAPPENED?!?
F	VICKI	Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's got the balloons rigged with compressor tanks!!
M	KNOX	Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.
F	VICKI	Allie -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
M	KNOX	Great. How?? COME ON!
M	KNOX	GIMME A HAND UP HERE!
M	JOKER	No... NOOOOO!!!
M	JOKER	There. There. -- GET 'EM!!
M	KNOX	GET THE CAR!
M	KNOX	HOLY SHIT!!
F	VICKI	You okay?
M	KNOX	Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
F	VICKI	God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever --
M	KNOX	Holy shit. Holy --
F	VICKI	ALLIE!!
M	KNOX	Jesus, Vicki.
M	JOKER	He'll be back... he'll be back!!
M	JOKER	You do him. I'm outta here.
M	VOICE	Yo.
M	DICK	HEY! COME ON!
M	DICK	Now we're even, huh? Even up.
M	BATMAN	How did you...
M	DICK	I hitched. MOVE IT!
M	BATMAN	The Joker. Is he --?
M	DICK	Forget it. Relax. ... He's mine now.
M	BATMAN	DICK!
M	JOKER	Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.
M	JOKER	I'm in the belltower. Don't land.
M	PILOT	E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.
M	JOKER	... Batman? Batman? Batman?
M	JOKER (cont.)	I thought you'd be more comfortable here in the belfry. Before I kill you I'd like to see who you are. Would that be okay?
M	JOKER (cont.)	Oh my, aren't we pretty. I know you! You're the rich boy!!
M	JOKER (cont.)	My goodness, what in the world made you do it? It must've been something pretty terrible!
M	JOKER (cont.)	You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
M	BATMAN	Mad... man...
M	JOKER	Well now, you're not exactly the picture of mental health, are you.
M	BATMAN	... Murderer...
M	JOKER	Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. I have to do it now, Bruce, but it won't even hurt. Now relax. The bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world...
M	JOKER (cont.)	Why, Bruce... IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!
M	BRUCE	No... sense... of humor?
M	CO-PILOT	PULL UP!! PULL --
M	ANCHORWOMAN	As the details of the Joker's heinous plan become known, a city's gratitude goes out to the mysterious Batman. His whereabouts remain unknown, but Batman -- if you're alive -- if you're listening -- thank you.
F	VICKI	I loved you too.
M	ALFRED	No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm afraid he's quite unreachable.
F	VICKI	I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
M	BRUCE	Ohhhh... you don't mean that.
F	VICKI	I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I --
M	BRUCE	Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
F	VICKI	I guess you did it, didn't you. You saved everyone. Almost.
M	BRUCE	I don't know how to explain this so it makes sense... but you saved me.
