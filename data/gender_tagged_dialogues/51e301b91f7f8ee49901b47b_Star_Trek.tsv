M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MIDWIFE	He is strong.
F	AMANDA	... hello.
M	YOUNGER MIDWIFE	The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
M	MIDWIFE	She is human.
M	MIDWIFE (CONT'D)	Sarek arrives.
M	SAREK	Well done.
F	AMANDA	Thanks.
M	SAREK	Your tone suggests disappointment. The Science Council required my presence for a session regarding--
F	AMANDA	Don't do that. You knew I wanted you here.
M	SAREK	As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.
F	AMANDA	Well traditionally, I'm not the one giving birth. CONTINUED: 15C I moved here -- to another planet -- to be with you. I needed you to be with me today. Holding my hand and telling me I'm doing great, even when I'm just... breathing the best I can.
M	SAREK	You are correct. I should have been here. I am sorry.
M	SAREK (CONT'D)	I had a thought. That we might name the child after one of our respected early society-builders. His name was "Spock".
M	SAREK (CONT'D)	Your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm.
F	AMANDA	No... Spock. ... Spock.
M	SAREK	The child has your eyes.
F	AMANDA	... and your ears.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU OFFICER PITTS	-- our sensors haven't made -- no sir, it looked like a -- how far are we from the of space -- Klingon Neutral Zone? -- 150,000 kilometers, but the its registry doesn't match any recorded profile --
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Report.
M	FIRST OFFICER	Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU FIRST OFFICER	Are they transmitting on any Negative, Captain -- all shut down.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU FIRST OFFICER	Hail the ship. What's the Nothing even close, Sir. closest match on registry?
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Any response?
M	OFFICER PITTS	No Sir -- hails met with silence.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Maybe they're incapable -- any identifiable damage?
M	OFFICER PITTS	Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem confused-- CONTINUED: 15D
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Confused?
M	OFFICER PITTS	-- not only is the ship unregistered -- but even its construction materials seem unrecognizable.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	... oh my God... A lightning storm... then this... Signal all departments: first contact protocols. Looks like we have someone new on the block. All Stop.
M	FIRST OFFICER	Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	That could be seen as an act of provocation -- all readings passive--
M	OFFICER PITTS CAPTAIN ROBAU	Sir, I have a reading -- they've locked weapons on us! -- Red alert! Arm weapons! Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees, mark two -- incoming -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Damage report!
M	CHIEF ENGINEER	Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen anything like it! Weapons off-line! Main power at 38 percent!
F	WINONA	-- what was that-- what's happening?!
M	FIRST OFFICER	-- you're okay-- thank God-- where are you?
F	WINONA	Medical bay-- I had a few close contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?
M	FIRST OFFICER	Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be fine--
M	OFFICER PITTS	They're firing another, Captain!
M	HELMSMAN OFFICER PITTS	-- life support failing on -- this is the U.S.S. Kelvin, unknown aggressor!

M	AYEL	My commander requests the presence of your captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire. You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal would be unwise.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Walk with me.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	If I don't report within fifteen minutes, execute general order 13.
M	FIRST OFFICER	Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	There is no help for us out here. If we're going down, we're taking them with us -- you save as many as you can. CONTINUED: 26A
M	FIRST OFFICER	... aye, Captain.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.
M	GEORGE KIRK	Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital signs to the main view screen.
M	OFFICER PITTS	Yessir.
M	SCIENCE OFFICER	Vitals on line.
M	GEORGE KIRK	-- thank you.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Computer, initiate departure sequence.
M	OFFICER PITTS	The shuttle's pulling out of main bay, Sir.
M	GEORGE KIRK	I want to see him -- floodlights please.
M	OFFICER PITTS	His heart rate's elevated--
M	HELMSMAN	He's scared.
M	GEORGE KIRK	He's brave. That's what he is.
M	AYEL	Are you familiar with this craft?
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Who is your commander? Is it him?
M	AYEL	You will speak only to me.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	Then ask your commander what right he has to attack a Federation vessel.
M	AYEL	That was hardly an attack. My commander will easily destroy your ship. If you do not respond to the question.
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.
M	AYEL	Are you familiar with -- or better, know the location of -- Ambassador Spock?
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.
M	AYEL	A final question. What is the current stardate? CONTINUED: 26H
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	... Stardate? ... it's 2233.04. ... hey, where are you from--?
M	OFFICER PITTS GEORGE KIRK	They're launching again! Evasive! Evasive! Delta-Five
M	GEORGE KIRK	I'm initiating General Order 13! Set self-destruct for maximum matter- antimatter yield! Two minute countdown!
M	OFFICER PITTS	Yessir!
M	GEORGE KIRK	I want auto-pilot targeted for their fuel cells!
M	TACTICAL OFFICER	Sir, unable to locate the ship's power source!
M	GEORGE KIRK	Then just target the damn thing dead center!
M	HELMSMAN	We got bigger problems: the first hit destroyed auto-pilot! CONTINUED: 26K The only way we're gonna ram that ship is to fly manual control!
M	GEORGE KIRK	shuttles, now! THAT'S AN ORDER! GO!
M	GEORGE KIRK (CONT'D)	All decks, this is the Captain speaking -- evacuate the ship immediately, get to your designated shuttle crafts --
M	GEORGE KIRK (V.O.) WINONA	-- repeat: evacuate ship and get to designated shuttles -- that's George's voice --
M	NURSE	We're packing it up -- you'll deliver in the shuttle!
F	WINONA	-- George!
M	GEORGE KIRK	I have medical shuttle 37 standing by, get to it now -- can you do that?
F	WINONA	Yes -- where are you? CONTINUED: 26M
M	GEORGE KIRK	I'm on my way.
F	WINONA	Good-- and George, it's coming-- our baby, it's coming now.
M	GEORGE KIRK	I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart.
F	WINONA	-- Agh! That was-- that was a big one!
M	NURSE	Just keep breathing, Honey, you're gonna be just fine--
F	WINONA	-- the baby, too, right?
M	NURSE	-- the baby too. CONTINUED: 26R
M	GEORGE KIRK	Captain to shuttle 37 -- is my wife on board?
M	SHUTTLE PILOT	Yessir, she is--
M	GEORGE KIRK	I need you to go now, d'you hear me?
M	SHUTTLE PILOT	We're waiting for you, Sir--
M	GEORGE KIRK	No-- go, take off, immediately.
M	SHUTTLE PILOT	... yessir!
F	WINONA	Wait! We can't go, my husband isn't here yet! Please! STOP--!
M	NURSE	You'll need to push now-- are you ready?
F	WINONA	The shuttle's leaving-- where are you?
M	GEORGE KIRK	My love? Listen carefully, okay?
F	WINONA	-- we're about to have this baby --
M	GEORGE KIRK	Sweetheart... I'm not going to be able to be there.
F	WINONA	-- no-- no, no-- wait--
M	GEORGE KIRK WINONA	I want you to hear me. Please. Are you still on the ship? No- -- There's no other way-- my - no, you need to be here-- love-- you know all I want-- -- George, I can't do this all I want in the world is to without you-- -- please -- don't d--!
F	DOCTOR	Okay-- you need to push.
M	GEORGE KIRK	Hey! Hey, so what is it?
M	WINONA'S VOICE	-- it's a boy.
M	GEORGE KIRK	It's a boy? Yeah? Tell me... tell me about him-- please--
F	WINONA	He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you. George, you should be here --
M	GEORGE KIRK	I know-- so what should we call him, huh?
F	WINONA	We could name him after your father.
M	GEORGE KIRK	Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No, that's the worst-- we'll name him after your dad-- let's call him Jim.
F	WINONA	... Jim. Jim it is. CONTINUED: 26ZA
M	GEORGE KIRK WINONA	Sweetheart? Sweetheart? I love you. Can you hear me? -- yes-- yes, I hear you... -- I love you. I love y--
M	KLINGON VOICE (P.A.)	Trespassing vessel: you have entered the jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire. Power down and prepare to be boarded or you will be destroyed.
M	AYEL	Commander Nero -- we're surrounded. Sir-- what are your orders?
M	COMPUTER VOICE SPOCK	What is the square root of 2,396,304? -- one-thousand-five-hundered- forty-eight -- -- Correct. What is the central assumption of Quantum -- everything that can happen parallel universes -- -- Correct. Identify the 20th century earth composers of the following musical progression: -- Paul McCartney and John Lennon. -- Correct CONTINUED: 45
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Your score is one-hundred percent. Congratulations. Spock.
M	YOUNG SPOCK	I presume you've prepared new insults for today.
M	VULCAN BULLY #1	Your mother lies with many men.
M	YOUNG SPOCK	I have no such information.
M	VULCAN BULLY #2	You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and therefore, have no place in the universe.
M	YOUNG SPOCK	This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me. Logic dictates you would cease by now.
M	VULCAN BULLY #1	Look. He has human eyes. They look sad, don't they?
M	VULCAN BULLY #2	Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli.
M	VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)	He's a traitor, you know. Your father. For marrying her.
M	AMANDA SAREK	-- where I'm from, when someone hits you, you hit back- - how is that not logical? -- Spock had no reasonable -- They pick on him -- they expectation of being tease him -- every day. physically injured -- -- Which is precisely when reason must guide his actions -- I want him to embrace above all. Vulcan, you know that... but he has to be himself-- which means, occasionally, being -- His "humanity" is very the -- When Vulcans get disgusted with each other, they never just walk away, do they? -- No. -- Well humans do.
M	YOUNG SPOCK	I did not mean to create conflict between you and mother.
M	SAREK	In marriage... conflict is...
M	YOUNG SPOCK	... constant?
M	SAREK	Natural. Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly destroyed us... that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you must choose.
M	YOUNG SPOCK	... between you and mother?
M	SAREK	Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings... so that they do not control you.
M	YOUNG SPOCK	They called you a traitor. You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan... and yet you married a human... why?
M	SAREK	As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother... was logical. Spock. You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are faced with... is which path you will take. This is something only you can decide.
M	UNCLE FRANK	Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I could give a damn!
M	YOUNG KIRK	-- wait-- no! Where are you going?
M	GEORGE JR.	Anywhere but here, far as I can get!
M	UNCLE FRANK	Which won't be far enough -- know what your problem is?! No one ever taught you respect! How to follow orders! Do as you're told! -- what the hell are you doing?
M	YOUNG KIRK	I-- I just don't want my brother to go.
M	UNCLE FRANK	Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the car! How many damn times do I need to repeat myself?! How many damn times? How many?
M	YOUNG KIRK	Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!
M	GEORGE JR.	This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank. I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no idea what he's like when she's not here-- d'you hear him talking like he's our dad?! And that's not even his car you're washing! That was Dad's car! You know why you're washing it? Because he's gonna sell it!
M	JIM	Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom when she gets back from Africa.
M	GEORGE JR.	She's gone for five more months, by then I'll be in a different system. You're gonna be okay. You always are. Always doing everything right -- good grades and obeying every stupid order... I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me how to do that and I'll stay.
M	COP	Son, you pull over that car!
M	JIM	I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
M	GEORGE JR.	-- no... way.
M	COP	What's your name, son?
M	JIM	My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.
M	KLINGON GUARD (O.S.)	You say they are not yours...
M	KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)	... these Federation maps we found in your pockets.
M	ALIEN	I speak the truth. I do.
M	KLINGON GUARD	Then who are they for?
M	KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)	You would rather die then tell us?
M	ALIEN	... NERO!!!
M	KLINGON INTERROGATOR	I have come far to meet you. "The One Who Does Not Speak." Ten years is a long time to maintain silence. Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon, just as I do not speak Romulan. CONTINUED: 54B But I assume we both speak the language of our common enemy.
M	KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)	We found this book in your cell. Cartography, mathematics-- what do these mean? This date here -- eleven years from now-- what happens then? And why attempt to smuggle in maps of Federation space?
M	KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)	When you were captured we assumed you were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil the Empire. But because the Romulans deny your existence, I believe you are much more than that.
M	KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)	Your ship remains in orbit above us now. We've been asking for its secrets for too long. That is why I am here. We want to know how it works and I believe now, finally... you will tell us.
M	KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)	Centaurian slugs. Their native planet is in constant sunlight. As a result, there's nothing they hate more... than darkness. CONTINUED: (2) 54B They try to claw and bite their way out of any dark space they're in.
F	AMANDA	Spock, come here, let me see you. No.
F	AMANDA	Spock. There is no need to be so anxious. You'll do fine.
M	SPOCK	I am hardly "anxious", mother. And "fine" has variable definitions. "Fine" is unacceptable.
M	SPOCK (CONT'D)	May I ask a personal query?
F	AMANDA	... anything.
M	SPOCK	Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all emotion... I trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you.
F	AMANDA	As always... whoever you choose to be... you will have a proud mother.
M	SCIENCE MINISTER	You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well.
M	SPOCK	It was logical to cultivate multiple options.
M	SCIENCE MINISTER	Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy.
M	SPOCK	If you would clarify, Minister-- what "disadvantage" are you referring to?
M	SCIENCE MINISTER	... your human mother. CONTINUED: 58
M	SPOCK	Council -- ministers. I must decline.
M	SCIENCE MINISTER	No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy.
M	SPOCK	Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished.
M	SAREK SPOCK	Spock. You have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan At the moment, Father, I can honor our race than to attend Starfleet as its first Vulcan.
M	SCIENCE MINISTER	Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?
M	SPOCK	I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your "insight" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper.
M	UHURA	Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	That's a lot of drinks for one woman. Wearing those boots.
M	UHURA	And a shot of Jack, straight up.
F	KIRK	Make it two -- her shot's on me.
M	UHURA	Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.
F	KIRK	Don't you want my name before you completely reject me?
M	UHURA	I'm good without it.
F	KIRK	You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim Kirk. If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up.
M	UHURA	Uhura.
F	KIRK	Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what?
M	UHURA	Just Uhura.
F	KIRK	They don't have last names in your world?
M	UHURA	Uhura is my last name.
F	KIRK	They don't have first names in your world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying. What's your focus?
M	UHURA	Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't know what that means.
F	KIRK	Let me guess: study of Alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means you've got a talented tongue.
M	UHURA	And for a moment I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals.
F	KIRK	Well. Not only.
M	UHURA	You think you're smart.
F	KIRK	Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.
M	BURLY CADET	This guy bothering you?
M	UHURA	Beyond belief, but nothing I can't handle.
F	KIRK	You could handle me. That's an invitation.
M	BURLY CADET	Hey. You mind your manners.
F	KIRK	At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke. Like your hairline.
M	UHURA	Hey -- Jim: enough.
M	BURLY CADET	What was that?
F	KIRK	You heard me, Moon Beam.
M	BURLY CADET	You know how to count farm boy? There's five of us... and one of you.
F	KIRK	Okay, so go get some more guys, come back and it'll be an even fight.
M	UHURA	Enough! STOP!
M	PIKE	Outside, all of you! NOW!
M	PIKE (CONT'D)	Y'alright, Son?
F	KIRK	You can... whistle really loud, y'know that?
M	PIKE	I couldn't believe when the bartender told me who you are.
F	KIRK	... and who am I, Captain Pike?
M	PIKE	Your father's son. For my dissertation, I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about your dad... he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.
F	KIRK	He sure learned his lesson.
M	PIKE	Depends on how you define winning. You're here, aren't you? That instinct to leap without looking-- that was his nature, too. And in my opinion it's something Starfleet has lost. We're admirable, respectable. But overly-disciplined. Those cadets you took on, they'll make competent officers -- but you can bet your ass they'll run home to momma the minute they're looking down the barrel of a Klingon phaser cannon.
F	KIRK	-- why are you talking to me?
M	PIKE	I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor. Your aptitude tests were off the charts-- what is it, d'you like being the only Genius Level repeat-offender in the midwest?
F	KIRK	Maybe I love it.
M	PIKE	So your daddy dies... you can settle for a less-than-ordinary life. Or do you feel like you're meant for something better? Something special?
F	KIRK	Come to think of it, I do want to feel special. You know what? I'm gonna go start a book club--
M	PIKE	Enlist in Starfleet.
F	KIRK	Enlist. You must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month--
M	PIKE	If you're half the man your father was, Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could be an officer in four years, have your own ship in eight.
F	KIRK	We're even, right? I can go.
M	PIKE	Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800. Your father was Captain of a Starship. For twelve minutes. I dare you to do better.
M	SHUTTLE PILOT	Waiting for something, Cap?
M	PIKE	... No. Guess not.
M	PIKE (CONT'D)	Hold her a second...
M	SHIPYARD WORKER	Nice ride, man.
F	KIRK	Live it up. Four years? I'm gonna do it in three.
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	At ease, Gentlemen. Never did get that first name.
M	UHURA	And you never will.
M	MAN'S VOICE	Are you people deaf? I told you I don't need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!
M	FLIGHT OFFICER MAN	-- you need to find a seat -- -- I had one, in the bathroom, -- Sir, for your own safety, -- I suffer from Aviaphobia, siddown, or I will MAKE you case you don't understand big
M	MAN	I might throw up on you.
F	KIRK	I think these things're pretty safe--
M	MAN	Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds -- solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell, some of the damn passengers are blue. And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles, see if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding-- space is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence.
F	KIRK	I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space.
M	MAN	Yeah, well my ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce, I got nowhere to go but up. Leonard McCoy.
F	KIRK	Jim Kirk-- you really gonna throw up--?
M	MCCOY	Maybe--
M	KLINGON GUARD #1	The day you've been waiting for is upon us, Silent One. And look. No sign of salvation. No sign of change. Just more pain.
F	NERO	The wait is over.
F	KIRK	So you'll do it for me, right?
M	MCCOY	I have no interest.
F	KIRK	I didn't ask if you have interest, I asked if you'd do it.
M	MCCOY	I'm about to ask you an obvious question: why bother?
F	KIRK	Because I've failed the test twice.
M	MCCOY	And you're determined to make it three. We've all failed it-- everyone has, and that's the point! No one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not like you need to pass it to graduate.
F	KIRK	So Bones: why do they make us take it?
M	MCCOY	I told you to stop calling me that. You're very annoying.
F	KIRK	And you're the greatest -- thank you.
M	MCCOY	You'd better study for it this time.
F	KIRK	Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date. CONTINUED: 64H
M	MCCOY	A date? Listen, as smart as you are, which ain't much, if you don't prepare--
F	KIRK	You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna be-- no idea.
M	MCCOY	Seriously, stop calling me Bones! "Bones".
M	GAILA	-- oh Jim... Jim... Jim, I love you.
F	KIRK	... Yeah. I sent you a message.
M	GAILA	I say "I love you", and you say "I sent you a message?"
M	KIRK GAILA	-- but you can only open it tomorrow at three o'clock on the dot -- -- what are you talking about? What is it? What does it say? -- Gaila, promise me you're not going to open it 'till -- what is it? Tell me what three -- it says! you don't promise me you'll -- All right!! Three o'clock! wait -- I prom--
M	GAILA (CONT'D)	You can't get caught in this dorm-- hide! Under the bed, quick!
M	GAILA (CONT'D)	Hey-- I thought you were going to be in the long-range sensor lab all night.
M	UHURA	I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I picked up an emergency transmission from a Klingon prison planet -- there was an escape and a ship stolen from th-- ... you okay?
M	GAILA	Yeah, been running simulations all week, just catching up on some rest. Tired. That's all.
M	UHURA	Were you running simulations with the mouth-breather hiding under the bed?
F	KIRK	Your hearing is scary-- you sure both your parents are human?
M	UHURA	The hell are you doing with him in here?
M	GAILA JIM	I can't help it! I love him! Gaila loves me-- Get outta here -- it's my ass too if administration catches you in this dorm.
F	KIRK	You and I have a big day tomorrow --
M	UHURA	You're gonna fail.
F	KIRK	If I pass, will you tell me your first name?
M	UHURA	No. Good night.
F	KIRK	I think the fact that you picked up a transmission of a Klingon prison escape is very interesting.
M	AYEL	We have arrived at the coordinates you requested. Stardate confirmed. 2258.5.
F	NERO	Standby.
M	AYEL	Captain... long range scans of Beta Quadrant complete. Romulus is there. She's there. We could go. Right now, go home...
F	NERO	Not yet -- not like this. Not how we left. This is our chance... to serve our people. We owe it to them -- to do what no other Romulan could ever do. CONTINUED: 81
M	NERO (CONT'D)	Welcome back. Spock.
M	UHURA	-- we are receiving a distress signal from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship has lost power and is stranded. Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them.
F	KIRK	"Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them... Captain."
M	MCCOY	Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral Zone. And they are firing upon us.
F	KIRK	That's okay.
M	MCCOY	It's okay?
F	KIRK	Yeah, don't worry about it.
M	TEST ADMINISTRATOR #1	Did he say "don't worry about it"?
M	TEST ADMINISTRATOR #2	-- what's he doing?
M	MCCOY	Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking -- and targeting our ship -- I don't suppose this is a problem either?
F	KIRK	Nah.
M	WEAPONS OFFICER	They're firing, Captain.
F	KIRK	Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship.
M	UHURA	And how do you expect us to rescue them when we're surrounded by Klingons?
F	KIRK	Alert medical.
M	MCCOY	Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty percent.
F	KIRK	I understand.
M	MCCOY	Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?
F	KIRK	Mmmm... no.
M	MCCOY	Of course not.
M	TEST ADMINISTRATOR #1	-- the hell's happening?!
M	UHURA	-- the Kobayashi Maru is still in distress... but... the Klingons have stopped firing.
F	KIRK	Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.
M	MCCOY	Jim, their shields are up.
F	KIRK	Are they?
M	MCCOY	... no.
F	KIRK	Fire on all enemy ships -- one photon each should do -- let's not waste ammunition.
M	WEAPONS OFFICER	Target lock acquired on all warbirds -- firing!
F	KIRK	Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So. We've eliminated all enemy ships, no one on board was injured and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	Anything else?
M	TEST ADMINISTRATOR #2	How the hell'd that kid beat your test?
M	SPOCK	... I do not know.
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT	James T. Kirk. Step forward.
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)	An incident has occurred today that concerns the entire student body. Academic immorality by one is an assault on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code. Is there anything you care to say before we begin?
F	KIRK	Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly. CONTINUED: 83
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT	Step forward please. This is Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years.
M	SPOCK	Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.
F	KIRK	Your point being?
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT	In academic vernacular, you cheated.
F	KIRK	Respectfully. Define "cheating".
M	SPOCK	To deceive by trickery.
F	KIRK	Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable.
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT	Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings.
F	KIRK	Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat.
M	SPOCK	Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario --
F	KIRK	I don't believe in no-win scenarios -- CONTINUED: (2) 83
M	SPOCK	Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson.
F	KIRK	Please, enlighten me.
M	SPOCK	You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.
F	KIRK	"I of all people?"
M	SPOCK	Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?
F	KIRK	How long did it take you to look that up?
M	SPOCK	How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat?
F	KIRK	Maybe you just don't like that I beat your test.
M	SPOCK	I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our vernacular. I've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar.
F	KIRK	What an idiot I am for taking that personally --
M	SPOCK	Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.
M	48A	CONTINUED: (3) 83
F	KIRK	Enlighten me again.
M	SPOCK	The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.
F	KIRK	So you're telling me the point. Of the whole thing. Is to be afraid?
M	SPOCK	Fear is necessary, yes.
F	KIRK	Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?
M	SPOCK	Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions.
F	KIRK	You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan. And I'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all? And if that's the case -- What's that say about your ability to make command decisions?
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT	We've received a distress call from Vulcan. Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic probation pending the result of your hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is at recess until further notice -- dismissed.
M	PIKE	Cheating isn't winning.
F	KIRK	Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
M	MCCOY	I don't know, but I like him.
F	KIRK	Excuse me, you didn't call my name. Kirk, James T.. CONTINUED: 84
M	BARRACKS LEADER	You're on academic probation. That means you're grounded until the Academy Board rules.
M	MCCOY	... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor. Most likely. Look, Jim -- I gotta go --
F	KIRK	... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.
M	MCCOY KIRK	Come with me -- -- what're you doing --?
M	UHURA	Commander, a word?
M	SPOCK	Yes, Lieutenant?
M	UHURA	Was I not one of your top students?
M	SPOCK	Indeed you were --
M	UHURA	Did I not receive a Gold rating for Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet first place over Kyoto and MIT at the Oxford Invitational?
M	SPOCK	An exceptional achievement, to be su--
M	UHURA	-- and did I not, on multiple occasions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies" in subspace transmission tests?!
M	SPOCK	Consistently, yes--
M	UHURA	And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the Farragut.
M	SPOCK	It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
M	UHURA	No. No. I am assigned to the Enterprise.
M	SPOCK	Oh. Yes, I believe you are.
F	KIRK	What are you doing?
M	MCCOY	Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave you there, looking all pitiful-- roll up your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas.
M	KIRK MCCOY	Ow-- what for? To give you symptoms. -- I don't understand-- -- you're gonna start to lose vision in your left eye -- -- yeah, I already have -- -- don't stand up yet -- -- what'd you do to me? -- you're gonna get a really (in pain) bad headache. And flopsweat. -- this is a favor?! -- yeah, you're welcome.
M	SCANNING OFFICER	"Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise --
M	MCCOY	But I am, and Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient's to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me. You can see he's suffering, he needs me as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to this ship, so's he, or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers?
M	SCANNING OFFICER	... as you were.
M	MCCOY	As you were.
F	KIRK	I might throw up on you.
M	MCCOY	You should look at this.
F	KIRK	Bones. Thanks for getting me on board. But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.
M	MCCOY	Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard.
M	SPOCK	Captain, engineering reports "ready for launch".
M	PIKE	The maiden voyage of our newest flagship deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today, but her christening will have to be our reward for a safe return-- All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare for immediate departure. Helm, thrusters. CONTINUED: 90
M	SULU	Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock Control reports ready -- thrusters fired, separating from space dock --
M	KIRK MCCOY	-- oh, this wasn't worth it -- I wish I didn't know you-- I'm itching in my mouth, this is Here's a short-lasting horrible-- sedative -- those symptoms won't last long, don't be an infant.
M	SULU	The fleet's cleared space dock, Captain. All ships ready for warp.
M	PIKE	Set course for Vulcan.
M	SULU	Course laid in.
M	PIKE	Maximum warp. Punch it.
M	PIKE	Lieutenant, where's Helmsman McKenna?
M	SULU	Uh, he has lungworms, Sir? He'll be fine but couldn't report to his post-- I'm Hikaru Sulu --
M	PIKE	-- and you are a pilot, right?
M	SULU	Very much so, Sir-- I'm not sure what's... wrong here...
M	PIKE	Is the parking brake on?
M	SULU	-- no, I'll figure it out, just--
M	SPOCK	Have you disengaged the External Inertial Dampener?
M	SULU	Ready for warp, Sir.
M	PIKE	The external inertial dampener. That's... the parking brake.
M	SULU	... yessir.
M	PIKE	Let's punch it!
M	ROMULAN CREW MEMBER	Captain Nero, drilling has begun.
F	NERO	Prepare the Red Matter. Tell me when we reach core depth.
M	SULU	Engines at Maximum Warp, Captain.
M	PIKE	Russian whiz kid-- what's your name again? Chanko? Cherpov?
M	CHEKOV	Ensign Chekov, Pavel H., Sir.
M	PIKE	Fine, Chekov, Pavel H.: begin shipwide mission broadcast.
M	CHEKOV	Yessir, happy to. Ensign authorization code: Nine-Five- Wictor Wictor-Two--
M	CHEKOV (CONT'D)	Aigh, thees is the 23rd Century -- what good is woice recognition that doesn't recognize your woice? Nine-Five-Victor-Victor-Two.
M	CHEKOV ON SCREEN	Your attention, plees: At twenty-two hundred hours, telemetry detected an anomaly in the Neutral Zone. What appeared to be a lightning storm in space.
M	CHEKOV ON SCREEN	Soon after, Starfleet received a distress signal from the Vulcan High Council that their planet was experiencing seismic activity. We then lost contact with Vulcan entirely.
M	CHEKOV ON SCREEN (CONT'D)	Our mission is to assess the condition of Vulcan and assist in evacuations, if necessary.
M	CHEKOV ON SCREEN (CONT'D)	We should be arriving at Vulcan within two minutes. Thank you for your time.
M	MCCOY	Jim, I told you to stay d-- good God!
F	KIRK	-- what's this?!
M	MCCOY	-- I don't know-- a reaction to the vaccine -- damnit --
M	CHEKOV ON SCREEN	-- telemetry detected an anomaly in the Neutral Zone. What appeared to be a lightning storm in space.
F	KIRK	-- Bones -- we have to stop the ship--
M	MCCOY	-- you're not allergic to Cardassian vole dander, are you?
F	KIRK	--- what? How the hell would I know? Is Uhura on board?
M	MCCOY	You need an antidote, Jim, or you're gonna die.
M	MCCOY	Jim, I'm not kidding, you gotta keep your heart rate down.
F	KIRK	Computer, locate crew member Uhura --
M	MCCOY	I haven't seen a reaction this severe since Med school.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Lieutenant Uhura is at signals monitoring station twelve -- deck four.
F	KIRK	We're flying into a trap.
M	MCCOY	You're delusional, you know that.
M	MCCOY	Come here -- Jim -- don't move --
F	KIRK	-- ow! Stop it! The transmission from the Klingon prison planet -- what exactly did you hear?
M	UHURA	What are you doing here-- what happened to your hands?!
F	KIRK	Who was it who escaped? What was the ship that was stolen--?! -- what's happening to my mouth?
M	MCCOY	-- you've got Numb Tongue --
F	KIRK	Numb tongue?
M	MCCOY	That's not good-- I can fix that--
F	KIRK	OW, DAMNIT!!! SONOFABITCH!
M	SAREK	AMANDA! WE MUST GET TO THE SHELTER!
M	MIT	
F	KIRK	Captain Pike-- Sir, we have to stop ship!
M	PIKE MCCOY	-- Mr. Kirk! How the hell did you get on board the This man is under the Enterprise?! influence of a severe reaction to a vaccine. He is delusional and I take full responsibility for -- Vulcan isn't experiencing a natural disaster, it's being attacked -- by Romulans.
M	PIKE	Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough attention for one day -- Dr. McCoy, return to medical, we'll have words later.
M	MCCOY	Yessir.
M	SPOCK KIRK	As you know, Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel. By Starfleet Yeah, I get it, you're a regulations, that makes him a great arguer, I'd love to do stowaway... it again with you, too. -- By recommending a full stop in trans-warp in the midst of a rescue mission? -- It's not a rescue mission-- listen to me! It's an attack! -- Based on what facts?
F	KIRK	Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting storm in space -- that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth, before a Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin. You know that, I read your dissertation. Which was good. Fact: This ship -- which had formidable and advanced weaponry -- was never seen or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin attack took place on the edge of Klingon space and at 11-hundred hours last night there was an escape from a Klingon prison planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and it was reported that they stole a ship from the prison dock.
M	PIKE	And you know of this prison escape how?
M	UHURA	Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the message myself. Kirk's report is accurate.
F	KIRK	We're warping into a trap-- there are Romulans waiting for us, I promise you that.
M	SPOCK	The cadet's logic is sound. And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion.
M	PIKE	Scan Vulcan space, check if any transmissions are being made in Romulan.
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Sir, I'm-- not sure I could distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan.
M	PIKE	How about you -- you speak Romulan, Cadet...?
M	UHURA	Uhura, Sir. All three dialects.
M	PIKE	Uhura, relieve the Lieutenant -- Mr. Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.
M	HANNITY	The other ships are out of warp and have arrived at Vulcan, Sir-- but we seem to have lost all contact--
M	UHURA	Captain, I pick up no Romulan transmissions -- or transmissions of any kind in the area. There seems to be something jamming all communication around Vulcan.
F	KIRK	It's because they're being attacked. Captain. Please.
M	PIKE	Shields up. Ready all weapons.
M	SULU	Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds! Four... three... two--
M	CAPTAIN PIKE SULU	EMERGENCY EVASIVE! ON IT, SIR!
M	ROMULAN FIRST OFFICER	Sir, another Federation ship!
F	NERO	Destroy it, too.
M	SPOCK	Captain, they're locking torpedoes!
M	PIKE	Full reverse, come about Starboard ninety degrees! Drop us down underneath them! Prepare to fire all weapons!
M	SULU	Shields at thirty-two percent! Their weapons are powerful, Sir, we can't take another hit like that!
M	PIKE	Get me Starfleet Command!
M	SPOCK	Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere-- its signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities!
M	PIKE	All power to forward shields -- prepare to fire all weapons!
M	ROMULAN TACTICAL OFFICER	Fire torpedoes, take them out--!
F	NERO	WAIT!!!
M	NERO (CONT'D)	The hull -- magnify --
M	PIKE	Divert auxiliary power from port nacelle to the shields--!
M	UHURA	Captain, we're being hailed!
F	NERO	Hello.
M	PIKE	I am Captain Christopher Pike, to whom am I speaking?
F	NERO	I am called Nero.
M	PIKE	You've declared war against the Federation. Withdraw, and I'll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral loca--
F	NERO	I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart. As does your Vulcan crew member... isn't that right? Spock?
M	SPOCK	Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I are acquainted.
F	NERO	... no, we're not. Not yet. I would like you to see something. Spock. Captain Pike-- your transporter capability is disabled. You will man a shuttle and come aboard the Narada for negotiations. That is all.
M	KIRK SPOCK	-- he'll kill you, you know that-- Your survival is unlikely-- -- Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy-- going over to that -- I, too, suggest you rethink
M	PIKE	I understand that -- I need officers who have been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat!
M	SULU	I have training, Sir!
M	PIKE	Then come with me -- Kirk, you too-- you're not supposed to be here anyway. Radio the engine room, have Chief Engineer Olsen meet us at Shuttle Bay Five.
M	CHEKOV	Aye, Keptin.
M	PIKE	Let's go.
M	PIKE	Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do our job. I'm creating an opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have chutes -- you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship.
F	KIRK	... okay.
M	PIKE	Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the ship. Once we have transport capability and communications back up, you'll contact Starfleet and report what the hell's happening here. CONTINUED: 117 Something you've got only precious few minutes to figure out. If all else fails, fall back and rendezvous with the fleet in the Laurentian System. Kirk. I'm promoting you to First Officer.
M	KIRK SPOCK	What!?! -- Captain? While I'm gone we need to keep the chain of command. And you two make a swell team.
M	SPOCK	Captain. Please. I apologize, but the complexities of human pranks escape me.
M	PIKE	It's not a prank, Spock. And I'm not the Captain. You are.
F	KIRK	Once we knock out that machine... Sir, what happens to you?
M	PIKE	I guess you'll have to come get me. Careful with the ship. She's brand new. Suit up, Gentlemen.
M	SPOCK	Dr. Puri, report --
M	MCCOY	It's McCoy-- Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he's dead.
M	SPOCK	Then you have just inherited his responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.
M	MCCOY	Aye, Sir.
M	RED SHIRT ENGINEER	I am pumped to kick some Romulan ass! No joke. BRING IT ON!
F	KIRK	So what kinda combat training d'you have?
M	SULU	Fencing.
F	KIRK	... fencing.
M	PIKE (V.O.)	Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.
M	PIKE (CONT'D)	Good luck.
M	CHEKOV	Away team's entering the atmosphere --
M	OLSON	WHOOOAAAHYYYEAAAAH!
F	KIRK	OLSON, PULL NOW, NOW!!!
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	I'M COMING FOR YOU!
M	SULU	BEHIND YOU!!
M	PIKE	I'm Captain Christopher Pi-- So much for diplomacy.
M	SULU	None of this is familiar-- the interface, the controls--
M	KIRK SULU	Step back-- -- what, you have an idea? -- yeahyeah, I do--
M	UHURA	The jamming signal's gone -- communications are re-established --
M	CHEKOV	Transporter control re-engaged --
M	SPOCK	Chekov, run gravitational sensors -- I want to know what they're doing to the planet.
M	CHEKOV	Aye, Commander-- Keptin, sorry. Keptin.
M	ROMULAN HELMSMAN	The drill's been sabotaged, Sir.
F	NERO	Launch the red matter. Now.
F	KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise -- they just launched something toward the planet!
M	CHEKOV	Keptin: gravitational sensors are off the scale -- if my calculations are correct, that pod they launched is creating a singularity... that will consume the planet.
M	SPOCK	They're creating a black hole... at the center of Vulcan?
M	CHEKOV	... yessir.
M	SPOCK	How long does the planet have?
M	CHEKOV	... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes.
M	SPOCK	Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --
M	UHURA	What? Spock, wait --
M	UHURA (CONT'D)	-- where are you going?
M	SPOCK	To evacuate the Vulcan High Council-- they're tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among them--
M	UHURA	-- you can't beam them out?
M	SPOCK	It's not possible -- they'll be in the Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--
F	NERO	Retract the drill, let's move out!
F	KIRK	I GOTCHA! NOW PULL MY CHUTE! ENTERPRISE, WE'RE FALLING WITHOUT A CHUTE!!! BEAM US UP!!! BEAM US UP!!!
M	TRANSPORTER CHIEF	I'm trying! I can't lock on your signal! -- you're moving too fast!
M	CHEVOK	-- no-- I can do that-- I CAN DO THAT!!!
M	CREW MEMBER	The black hole's expanding, we won't reach minimum safe distance if we don't leave immediately!
M	CHEKOV	MOVE! I CAN DO THAT! I CAN DO THAT!!!
M	CHEKOV	I CAN LOCK ON! GIMME MANUAL CONTROL! QUICK!!!
F	KIRK	ENTERPRISE, WHERE ARE YOU?!?!
M	CHEKOV	-- holdonholdonholdonholdon!
F	KIRK	NOW NOW NOW!!! DO IT NOW!!!!!!
M	CHEKOV	Compensating gravitational pull and-- GOTCHA!
M	SULU	... thanks.
F	KIRK	... yeah, not a problem.
M	SPOCK	Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.
F	KIRK	The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN THERE? Are you nuts?!
M	SPOCK	Energize --
F	AMANDA	Spock--!
M	SPOCK	The planet's not safe, it has only seconds left -- we must evacuate now --
M	SPOCK	Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!
M	CHEKOV	Locking volume, transport in 5-4-3--
F	AMANDA	It's okay. To be scared. CONTINUED: 146
M	SPOCK	MOTHER!!!!
M	CHEKOV	NO!!! I'M LOSING HER!!! Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42: I have assumed command of the Enterprise.
M	SPOCK (V.O.)	We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.
M	SPOCK	Nero, who has destroyed my home planet. And most of its six billion inhabitants. I estimate no more than ten thousand survived. While the essence of our culture has been saved, in the elders who now reside upon this ship... I am now a member of an endangered species.
M	UHURA	I'm so sorry. What can I do? Tell me what you need.
M	SPOCK	... I need... I need for us all to continue performing admirably.
F	KIRK	Hey. Listen, about what happened at Starfleet. The test and everything-- I know it looks like I was... using you, or whatever. And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I just hope you'll forgive me.
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	... you're not Gaila, are you?
M	NOT GAILA	No.
F	KIRK	Sorry.
M	SPOCK	Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?
M	UHURA	Their trajectory suggests no other destination, Captain.
F	KIRK	Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet's a target.
M	CHEKOV	Yes, agreed-- but why didn't they destroy us?
M	SULU	Why waste a weapon? We weren't a threat.
M	SPOCK	That's not it. He said he wanted me to see something. The destruction of my home planet.
M	MCCOY	And how the hell did they do that by the way? When did they jump so far ahead in the arms race?
M	SPOCK	The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time.
M	MCCOY	Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist -- are you suggesting they're from the future?
F	KIRK	That is what he's suggesting and I don't buy it.
M	SPOCK	If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains -- however improbable -- must be the truth.
M	MCCOY	How poetic.
F	KIRK	Then what would an angry future Romulan want with Captain Pike?
M	SULU	As Admiral he knows details of Starfleet's defenses. What we need to do is catch up to that ship. Disable it, take it over and get Pike back.
M	82A	
M	MCCOY	Fantastic, I'm in.
M	SPOCK	Captain Pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant. We're technologically outmatched in every way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.
F	KIRK	"Illogical"-- you're funny.
M	CHEKOV	Not to mention we couldn't do it anyway: Nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them --
F	KIRK	-- what about assigning Engineering crews to try and boost our warp yield?
M	SPOCK KIRK	Remaining power and crew are being used to repair radiation leaks on the lower decks and damage to the main deflector shield-- without which we cannot communicate with -- okay--okay, okayokayokay--
M	SPOCK	We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to balance the terms of our next engagement --
F	KIRK	There won't be a next engagement, Spock: by the time we've "gathered", it'll be too late -- how many planets are you willing to risk? You say he's from the future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.
M	SPOCK	You're assuming Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. The contrary: Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the events of today -- thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.
M	MCCOY	Does anyone understand him?
M	UHURA	... an alternate reality.
M	SPOCK	Precisely. Whatever lives we might have lived, if the time continuum was disrupted... our destinies have changed. Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three-- -- wait-- don't do that -- Spock -- running back to the rest of the fleet for a confab is a massive waste of time-- -- These were the orders -- He also ordered us to go Captain Pike issued when he back and get him! Spock, left ship-- you're Captain now--! -- I am aware of my -- Every second we waste, responsibilities, Mr. Kirk! Nero's getting closer to his next target--! -- that is correct -- and why I'm instructing you to accept -- I will not allow us to go that I alone am in command. backwards, away from the problem, instead of hunting -- then I must remove you from Nero down! this ship. If I confine you to the brig, you'll likely escape. Mr. Chekov: have transportation prepare a deployment capsule. Mr. Sulu, escort him out.
M	SULU	I'm sorry.
F	KIRK	Yeah, don't worry ab --
F	NERO	You are only the second human I have ever met, face to face. You must have so many questions for me. I only have one for you. I need the subspace frequencies of Starfleet's border detection grids. Specifically those surrounding Earth.
M	PIKE	Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.
F	NERO	Christopher. Answer my question.
M	PIKE	No. You answer for the genocide you just committed on a peaceful planet--
F	NERO	I prevented genocide. Where I come from, Christopher... this ship is just a mining vessel. I chose a life of honest labor to provide for myself... and the wife who was carrying my child. I sit here now... knowing you as enemies. Not just of today. But of tomorrow. I watched as your Federation did nothing. They let us burn to death... as our planet broke in half.
M	PIKE	Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has not been destroyed. How can you blame the Federation for something that hasn't happened--?
F	NERO	It did happen. I remember it. I... felt it. When I lost her... I promised myself I would not speak another word until the day of my retribution. In twenty five years I forgot the sound of my own voice... but I didn't forget the pain. That feeling cannot be erased. A feeling that every surviving Vulcan now shares.
M	PIKE	If what you say is true... you can save Romulus. You have a second chance to --
F	NERO	-- yes, which is a gift I won't waste on mercy. My purpose, Christopher, is not simply to avoid the destruction of the home I love... ... but to create a Romulus which exists, free of the Federation. Only then will she be saved.
M	PIKE	Then we have nothing more to discuss.
F	NERO	It's not the fault of the human race that Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your extinction.
M	PIKE	How reassuring.
F	NERO	The frequencies, please.
M	PIKE	Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.
F	NERO	As you wish.

M	SPOCK PRIME	How did you find me--? Does Starfleet know of my presence?
F	KIRK	HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
M	SPOCK PRIME	I have been... and always shall be... your friend.
F	KIRK	-- no, I don't know you -- the only Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.
M	SPOCK PRIME	You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona -- you were born in 2233 --
F	KIRK	Stop. Please. I don't understand.
M	SPOCK PRIME	... I am Spock. One hundred and thirty years senior to the Vulcan you know.
F	KIRK	Bullshit.
M	SPOCK PRIME	It's remarkably pleasing to see you again. ... especially after the events of today.
F	KIRK	Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea how you know what you know. But I don't know you and if you are Spock we're not friends. You hate me. You marooned me here for mutiny...
M	SPOCK PRIME	Mutiny? You are not the Captain?
F	KIRK	You're the captain. Pike was taken hostage.
M	SPOCK PRIME	... by Nero.
F	KIRK	What do you know about him?
M	SPOCK PRIME	... he is a remarkably... CONTINUED: 161A troubled Romulan. ... Please. Allow me -- it will be easier--
F	KIRK	What're you doing--?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Our minds... one and together...One hundred and twenty-seven years from now everything ends.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova -- and like a cancer left untreated... it will grow... and destroy everything.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan Science Academy devised a plan to stop it. We built a ship containing a material capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a supernova. A black hole.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I would not return.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	My sacrifice, in service of all races, seemed only logical.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Unfortunately... before I could begin the mission... the supernova destroyed Romulus.
F	KIRK	Nero's planet was destroyed--
M	SPOCK PRIME	Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me continue.
M	KIRK SPOCK PRIME	This annoys me, I don't like -- I know, I know, I'm not it-- do we have to do it like surprised to hear you complain this--? -- allow me to finish. Nero came after me. Determined to thwart my mission. If Romulus was allowed to die, he said... all planets should share its fate.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	I needed an exit. I knew if this mission failed... everyone, everywhere... would lose everything.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	I realized: a large black hole could destroy the supernova. A smaller one... could be my escape. Could send me back in time, allowing me to complete my mission. So I created a black hole...
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	Nero must have understood what I was trying to do. Because he began racing for it.
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	Nero simply got to it first. How long I was travelling... I couldn't tell you. It was timeless. But when I arrived...
M	SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)	Nero was waiting for me.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Forgive me... emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld.
F	KIRK	... so you do feel...
M	SPOCK PRIME	"Cthia" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan.
F	KIRK	Going back in time... you changed all our lives.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people... seem to overlap significantly. Tell me about the rest of the crew? Chekov-- Uhura --?
F	KIRK	Tactical and Communications --
M	SPOCK PRIME	-- Sulu --
F	KIRK	-- he's the helmsman, why?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose.
F	KIRK	... he'd call it a damn miracle.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage. We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here.
F	KIRK	Where you came from... did I know my father?
M	SPOCK PRIME	... yes. You often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet.
M	SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)	You should know. He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise.
F	KIRK	... Captain?
M	SPOCK PRIME	A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.
M	SULU	Warp three. Course one-five-one mark three, the Laurentian System.
M	MCCOY	You wanted to see me?
M	SPOCK	Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as you did, must have been difficult.
M	MCCOY	... are you thanking me?
M	SPOCK	I'm simply acknowledging your difficulties.
M	MCCOY	Permission to speak freely, Sir.
M	SPOCK	I welcome it.
M	MCCOY	Do you. Okay then: are you out of your Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical thing? Maybe. The right one? Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure -- that kid doesn't know how to lose. Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize stallion in the stable."
M	SPOCK	... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential.
M	MCCOY	My God, Man... you could at least act like it was a hard decision.
M	SPOCK	I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical expertise.
F	KIRK	I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT NOW!
F	KIRK	... hello?!
M	KEENSER	... can I help you?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Are you the station chief?
M	KEENSER	... no. This way.
M	STARFLEET OFFICER	Hm.
M	KEENSER	Visitors.
M	STARFLEET OFFICER	You realize how unacceptable this is.
F	KIRK	Excuse me?
M	SPOCK PRIME	... Fascinating.
F	KIRK	What?
M	STARFLEET OFFICER	I'm sure it's no' your fault, and I know youse lads are just doing your jobs, but could you no' have come a wee bit sooner?! Six months I've been living on nothing but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the promise of a real food delivery! Six months, boys! It's pretty clear what's going on here, isn't it? Punishment! Ongoing! For something that was clearly an accident!
M	SPOCK PRIME	You're Montgomery Scott.
F	KIRK	You know him?
M	SCOTTY	Yes, that's me -- Scotty-- you're in the right place-- are there any other hard- working and equally-starving Starfleet officers around?
M	KEENSER	Me.
M	SCOTTY	You eat nothing. A bean and you're done for a week, I need food. And now you're here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.
M	SPOCK PRIME	You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming.
M	SCOTTY	Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about! How d'ya think I ended up here? I got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel... He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles -- so I told my instructor I could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system -- which is no big deal anyway -- but if I were so inclined I could actually do it with a lifeform! So I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle. Which... was a mistake.
F	KIRK	I know that dog. What happened to it?
M	SCOTTY	I'll tell ya when it reappears. Dunno. Feel guilty.
M	SPOCK PRIME	What if I told you your trans-warp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium?
M	SCOTTY	I haven't been stationed here that long. If such an equation had been discovered, I'da heard.
M	SPOCK PRIME	The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott... is because you haven't discovered it yet.
M	SCOTTY	Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant. D'they still have sandwiches where you're from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties? Cockaleekie soup?
F	KIRK	What is he talking about?
M	KEENSER	Food.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Allow us access to your shuttle... and I will show you what a genius you actually are.
M	SCOTTY	She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few other things. CONTINUED: 177
M	SCOTTY (CONT'D)	... rapid. That's impressive.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Your equation for achieving trans-warp beaming.
M	SCOTTY	Imagine that! Never occurred to me to think of space as the part that's moving.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Point of fact: it did occur to you. Extrapolating Enterprise's course --
M	SCOTTY	-- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage already, has it? Well, you must've done something right to be assigned to that ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady -- love to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you'll pardon the engineering parlance.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.
M	SCOTTY	Look, even if I believed you -- where you're from, what I've done-- which I don't -- we're still talkin' bout slingshotting aboard while she's going faster than light. Without a proper receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a blindfold. On a horse.
M	SPOCK	I calculate no more than a four meter margin of error.
M	SCOTTY	That's all well and good unless you rematerialize four meters outside the ship. CONTINUED: (2) 177
M	SPOCK PRIME	Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks --
F	KIRK	-- you're coming with us, right?
M	SPOCK PRIME	No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path.
M	KIRK SPOCK PRIME	Your destiny can wait -- he (simply, strong) won't believe me, only you can Under no circumstances can he explain w-- be made aware of my existence. You must promise me this.
F	KIRK	You're telling me I can't tell you I'm following your own orders? Why not? What happens?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.
F	KIRK	How, over your dead body?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command.
F	KIRK	So I need to emotionally compromise you?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Jim. I just lost my planet. I can tell you. I am emotionally compromised. What you must do... is get me to show it.
F	KIRK	Hm.
M	SCOTTY	Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's get this over with. he Enterprise has a decent cafeteria I'm guessing.
F	KIRK	You know... coming back in time... changing history... that's cheating.
M	SPOCK PRIME	A trick I learned from an old friend.
M	SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)	Live long, and prosper.
F	KIRK	-- no-- shit! -- no--nonono-- COMEONCOMEONCOMEON -- like the simulator: manual control enabled, pressure seal: enabled -- shutdown--
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Turbine Shutdown Not Allowed.
F	KIRK	DAMNIT!
M	CHEKOV	Keptin, we're detecting unauthorized access to a water turbine control board!
M	SPOCK	Bring up video.
M	SPOCK (CONT'D)	Security, this is the captain -- seal engineering deck and bring me the intruders in turbine station three -- set phasers to stun.
F	KIRK	You all right?
M	SCOTTY	-- nice -- (cough) -- ship. Really.
F	KIRK	-- let's get to the bridge--
M	SECURITY OFFICER #1	Come with me. Moon Beam.
F	KIRK	Surprise.
M	SPOCK	Who are you?
F	KIRK	He's with me.
M	SPOCK	We're travelling at warp -- how did you manage to get aboard this ship?
F	KIRK	You're the genius, you figure it out.
M	SPOCK	As Captain of this vessel I order you to answer the question.
F	KIRK	Well I'm not telling. Captain.
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	Does that frustrate you? My lack of cooperation... does it make you angry?
M	SPOCK	You are not a member of this ship's crew. Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you beamed ab --
F	KIRK	-- Don't answer him.
M	SPOCK	You will answer me.
M	SCOTTY	I'd rather not take sides.
M	SPOCK	Escort them to the Brig.
F	KIRK	What is it about you, Spock? Your planet was just destroyed -- your mother murdered -- and you're not even upset?
M	SPOCK	Your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate--
F	KIRK	HA! And yet you said fear was necessary for command. I mean -- did you see that bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?
M	SPOCK	Yes, of course I--
F	KIRK	So are you afraid or aren't you?!?
M	SPOCK	I will not... allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.
F	KIRK	Then why don't you stop me.
M	SPOCK	Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.
F	KIRK	What is it like? Not to feel? Anger. Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?!
M	SPOCK	-- back away --
F	KIRK	You must not feel anything! It must not even compute for you! You must not have loved her at all--!
M	SAREK	Spock!
M	SPOCK	Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been... emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
M	SCOTTY	I like this ship. It's exciting.
M	MCCOY	Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no Captain and no first officer to goddamn replace him.
F	KIRK	Yeah we do.
M	MCCOY	WHAT?!
F	KIRK	Thanks for the support!
M	UHURA	I sure hope you know what you're doing.
F	KIRK	... so do I. Attention crew of the Enterprise. This is James Kirk...
M	KIRK (V.O.)	Mr. Spock has resigned commission and advanced me to acting Captain. I know you were all expecting to regroup with the fleet, but I've ordered a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth.
F	KIRK	I want all departments at battle stations and ready in ten minutes. Either we're going down, or they are. Kirk out.
M	UHURA	I want some answers.
M	UHURA (CONT'D)	Right now. Where the hell'd you get trans-warp technology?
F	KIRK	-- yeah, you know that's complicated --
M	UHURA	
M	SULU	I'm a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can handle it -- how'd you get back?
M	CHEKOV	You vant us to trust you but you von't tell us the truth?
F	KIRK	No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain now! I don't have to tell you anything! Now listen: we need to figure out a way to catch up and get to Nero's ship.
M	SULU	There's not a chance. They're gonna be in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in ten minutes. We'll never make it.
M	MCCOY	Even if we could, you can't go in guns blazing, not with their technology, that's suicide.
F	KIRK	Then we find a way to get on that ship and steal the black hole device away from them.
M	SCOTTY	Well you can forget transwarp. No way to predict the Narada's position from here.
F	KIRK	Uhura: anything from Captain Pike?
M	UHURA	No... I've been monitoring all channels.
M	SAREK	You must not punish yourself. Speak your mind, Spock.
M	SPOCK	That would be unwise.
M	SAREK	What is necessary is always wise.
M	SPOCK	I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a child. Have I made so little progress?
M	SAREK	You will always be a child of two worlds. I am grateful for that. And for you. And not only because you are all I have left of her.
M	SPOCK	I feel anger. For the one who took her life. An anger I cannot stop.
M	SAREK	I believe she would say... do not try to. You asked me once. Why I married your mother. I married her because I loved her.
M	CHEKOV	Keptin Kirk? Excuse me, plees, could I...? Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask permission to--
M	CHEKOV	Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan, I've projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. If we could drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to Nero's sensors. We could follow him to Earth by staying in his blind spot.
F	KIRK	What blind spot?
M	CHEKOV	Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect us.
M	MCCOY	Wait a minute-- anyone understand this kid? How old are you?
M	CHEKOV	I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?
M	MCCOY	We're all old enough to shave here. Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.
M	SPOCK (CONT'D)	I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr. Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero's ship.
F	KIRK	I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.
M	SPOCK	Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ship's computer to locate the device. Also, my mother was human. Which makes Earth the only home I have left. CONTINUED: (3) 189
F	KIRK	Then I'm coming with you.
M	SPOCK	I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it.
F	KIRK	See, we're getting to know each other.
M	AYEL	The men and I have discussed this. What we are about to do. We have to turn the ship around. We can save our home. Stop.
M	AYEL (CONT'D)	We can go back. That's what we want. We have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No more. We want to go home now.
F	NERO	There is no need, Ayel. To threaten me. I understand. I understand. But you are wrong.
M	NERO (CONT'D)	We will return to Romulus when the Federation lies in ruins and not a moment before. When those who watched our people burn at last understand our pain, our loss. I refuse to return as a slave! We will return as conquerors! Deploy the drill.
M	SULU	Mr. Chekov, transfer manual control to the Captain's chair.
M	CHEKOV	Aye. I've projected the parabolic course you must follow. If you deviate by so much as a meter, we will be detected.
M	SULU	Give me one quarter impulse burst for five seconds and I'll do the rest with thrusters. On my mark. Three... two... one... fire.
M	SULU	All stop in three... two... one...
M	SULU (INTO CHAIR COMM)	Transporter Room. We're in stable geosynchronous orbit behind the Narada.
M	CHEKOV	No sign they've detected us --
M	SCOTTY	Well done, Mr. Sulu.
F	KIRK	Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel you have a tactical advantage fire on that ship. Even if we're still aboard. It's an order.
M	SULU	Yessir. Good luck.
M	UHURA	We'll be monitoring your frequency...
M	SPOCK	Thank you, Nyota.
F	KIRK	Her first name is...
M	SPOCK	I have no comment on the matter.
M	SCOTTY	If there's any common sense to their ship design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight.
F	KIRK	Energize. CONTINUED: 199
F	KIRK	Mine had a gun.
M	SPOCK	I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of Suus Mahna.
M	SPOCK (CONT'D)	I am unable to meld with these Romulans -- there are subtle differences in their physiology I did not anticipate --
M	KIRK SPOCK	-- punch him in the face -- make him talk! Suus Mahna his -- Suss Mahna is only intended longer a threat -- -- then pretend it's a threat - - I'm your captain, that's an order! What is your computer access code?
M	SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)	CODE!
M	ROMULAN HELMSMAN	The plasma drill is repaired and fully deployed.
F	NERO	Good. Let's begin.
M	CHEKOV	They've activated the drill --
M	UHURA	Communications and transporter inoperative --
M	SULU	They're on their own now.
M	SPOCK	What you refer to as the "Red Matter Device" is in the main hangar -- and I've located Captain Pike.
F	KIRK	Is he alive?
M	SPOCK	Unknown.
F	KIRK	Let's move.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled.
F	KIRK	Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.
M	SPOCK	Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar with this ship's design.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.
F	KIRK	Wow. That's weird.
M	SPOCK	Computer: what is your manufacturing origin?
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Stardate 2397, commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy.
M	SPOCK	It appears you've been keeping rather important information from me.
F	KIRK	Just trust me. Can ya do that?
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	I'll get Pike.
M	ROMULAN HELMSMAN	Primary core rupture, warp engines off- line!
F	NERO	HOW?!!
M	ROMULAN TACTICAL OFFICER	Someone has detonated weapons in the main hangar!
F	NERO	Restore power! Engage auxiliary systems!
M	ROMULAN TACTICAL OFFICER	The drill's been severed!
M	ROMULAN COMMANDER	Ambassador Spock's ship has been stolen as is heading out of the solar system!
F	NERO	-- WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?!
M	ROMULAN COMMANDER	... Spock.
F	NERO	Open a channel --
M	ROMULAN COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Channel Open --
F	NERO	Spock -- I should've killed you when I had the chance.
M	SPOCK	Under authority granted me by the Europa convention, I'm confiscating this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel. No terms. No deals.
F	NERO	You can't cheat me again, Spock. I know you better than you know yourself.
M	SPOCK	Last warning: unconditional surrender or you will be destroyed.
F	NERO	Fire at will.
M	ROMULAN COMMANDER	Sir-- if you ignite the red matter, the--
F	NERO	I want Spock dead! Fire!
M	PIKE	... Kirk?
F	KIRK	Came back, Sir. Just like you ordered.
M	NERO ON COMMS	... you should've fled, Spock. Sight target, standby torpedoes... FIRE!
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Warning: Shields off-line.
M	SPOCK	Computer, prepare self destruct sequence.
F	NERO	
F	KIRK	Nice timing, Lieutenant --
M	SCOTTY	Never beamed two targets from two places onto the same pad before! That was pretty good!
M	MCCOY	-- we're gonna need gastric stimulators, let's prep him for surgery, now!
M	ROMULAN COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Nero-- it's the Enterprise!
F	NERO	LOAD WEAPONS AND RAISE SHIELDS!!!
M	ROMULAN HELMSMAN	ENGINES USING ALL OUR POWER, SIR!
M	CHEKOV	Keptin! The enemy ship is losing power-- its shields are down!
F	KIRK	Hail them -- now!
M	KIRK (CONT'D)	This is Captain James T. Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise -- your ship is compromised -- too close to the singularity to survive without assistance -- which we are willing to provide.
M	SPOCK	Captain -- what are you doing?
F	KIRK	We show them compassion-- it may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus. It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like that.
M	SPOCK	No, not really, not this time.
F	NERO	I would rather suffer the death of Romulus a thousand times than accept assistance from you.
F	KIRK	You got it. Lock phasers! Fire everything we've got!
F	KIRK	Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here, Scotty! -- you bet yer ass, Captain --
F	NERO	Forgive me... Romulus...
F	KIRK	WHY AREN'T WE AT WARP?!
M	CHEKOV	-- WE ARE --!
M	SCOTTY OVER SPEAKERS	CAPTAIN, WE'RE TRAPPED IN THE GRAVITY WELL! IT'S GOT US!
F	KIRK	GO TO MAXIMUM WARP! PUSH IT!!!
M	SCOTTY	I'M GIVIN' HER ALL SHE'S GOT, CAPTAIN!
F	KIRK	ALL SHE'S GOT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH! WHAT ELSE D'YOU GOT?!
M	SCOTTY	IF WE EJECT THE CORE AND DETONATE, THE BLAST COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH US AWAY BUT I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING!
F	KIRK	
M	SPOCK	Father...?
M	SPOCK PRIME	I am not... our father.
M	SPOCK	... Fascinating.
M	SPOCK PRIME	There are so few Vulcans left. We cannot afford to ignore each other.
M	SPOCK	Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could've explained the truth?
M	SPOCK PRIME	Because you needed each other. Opposing yet complimentary opposites. It was that balance between us -- I should say you and Kirk -- that often made the impossible, possible.
M	SPOCK	... it was a test?
M	SPOCK PRIME	I'm in no position to pass judgment... my actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together... of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.
M	SPOCK	How did you persuade him to keep your secret?
M	SPOCK PRIME	I inferred universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.
M	SPOCK	You lied.
M	SPOCK PRIME	I implied.
M	SPOCK	A gamble...
M	SPOCK PRIME	An act of faith. One I hope you'll repeat in the future.
M	SPOCK	The future's not what it used to be... in the face of extinction, it's only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race.
M	SPOCK PRIME	And yet, you are in a unique position... you can be in two places at once. I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony, and assist in the foundation of a new science academy.
M	SPOCK	My future cannot be determined by your past. We are one, but not the same.
M	SPOCK PRIME	Then I ask that you do yourself a favor. Put away logic. Do what feels right. The world you've inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation... but there's no reason you must face it alone.
M	SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)	As my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving, I will simply say... good luck.
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT	This assembly calls Captain James Tiberius Kirk... CONTINUED: 243
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)	Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew, and the Federation. For your... unique solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award you with a commendation for original thinking.
M	ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)	By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby directed to report to Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.
F	KIRK	I relieve you, Sir.
M	PIKE	I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.
F	KIRK	Thank you, Sir.
M	SULU	Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines at your command, Sir.
M	CHEKOV	Weapons systems and shields on standby.
M	UHURA	Dock control reports ready. Yard Command signalling clear.
F	KIRK	Scotty how are we?
M	SCOTTY (O.S. OVER COMM LINK)	Dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency, Captain.
M	MCCOY	Same ship, different day.
F	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--
M	SPOCK	Permission to come aboard, Captain.
F	KIRK	... Permission granted.
M	SPOCK	As you have yet to select a first officer, respectfully, I would like to submit my candidacy. Should you desire, I can provide character references.
F	KIRK	It would be my honor, Commander. Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu. Take us out.
M	SULU	Aye, Captain.
M	SPOCK/NIMOY	Space... the final frontier. These are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission... to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life forms, and new civilizations... To boldly go, where no one has gone... before...
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	... oh my God... A lightning storm... then this... Signal all departments: first contact protocols. Looks like we have someone new on the block. All Stop.
M	KELVIN CREW MEMBER	All stations, FC-3 procedures initiated..."
M	KELVIN CREW MEMBER COMMS	Broadcasting universal greeting on all open frequencies.
M	FIRST OFFICER	Sir, should we initiate an active scan?
M	CAPTAIN ROBAU	That could be seen as an act of provocation -- all readings passive--

M	KELVIN CREW MEMBER (CONT'D)	Power signature detected -- level's increasing.
M	OFFICER PITTS CAPTAIN ROBAU	Sir, I have a reading -- they've locked weapons on us! -- Red alert! Arm weapons! locked on us at 320 mark two -- incoming -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!

M	KELVIN CREW MEMBER	Dispatch repair teams to deck 4.
M	CHIEF ENGINEER	Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen anything like it! Weapons off-line! Main power at 38 percent! ALTERNATE SCENE B Then I ask that you do yourself a favor... put away logic, and do what feels right. The world you've inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation... but there's no reason you must face it alone.
M	SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)	This was a gift to me. Representing... a dream. One we were unable to fulfill. The way you can now.
M	SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)	As my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving, I will simply say... good luck.
M	KIRK/ SHATNER	Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you... I know I know, it's illogical to celebrate something you had nothing to do with, but I haven't had the chance to congratulate you on your appointment to the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell me your first mission may take you away for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish you luck... and to say... I miss you, old friend. I suppose I'd always imagined us... outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching life swing us into our Emeritus years...
M	KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)	I look around at the new cadets now and can't help thinking... has it really been so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we stepped onto the Enterprise as boys? That I had to prove to the crew I deserved command... and their respect?
M	COMMANDANT	This assembly calls Captain James Tiberius Kirk...
M	COMMANDANT (CONT'D)	Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew, and the Federation. By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby directed to report to Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.
F	KIRK	I relieve you, Sir.
M	PIKE	... I am relieved.
M	PIKE (CONT'D)	And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award you with a commendation for original thinking.
M	PIKE (CONT'D)	Congratulations, Captain.
F	KIRK	Thank you, Sir.
M	BONES	... Same ship, different day. I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn now, Jim...' And of course you're right... but it got me thinking:
M	KIRK/SHATNER	Who's to say we can't go one more round? By the last tally, only twenty five percent of the galaxy's been chartered... I'd call that negligent. Criminal even -- an invitation. You once said being a starship captain was my first, best destiny... if that's true, then yours is to be by my side. If there's any true logic to the universe... we'll end up on that bridge again someday.
F	KIRK	Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the journey itself... is home. ALTERNATE SCENE C
