M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	VOICE-OVER	A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, like- wise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'. They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold-- wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.
M	VOICE-OVER	Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause sometimes there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man.
M	VOICE-OVER	And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles.
M	GEORGE BUSH	This aggression will not stand... This will not stand!
M	VOICE-OVER	...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County.
M	VOICE-OVER	...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man... sometimes there's a man.
M	VOICE-OVER	Wal, I lost m'train of thought here. But--aw hell, I done innerduced him enough.
M	DUDE	It's the LeBaron.
M	VOICE	We want that money, Lebowski. Bunny said you were good for it.
M	VOICE	Where's the money, Lebowski!
M	VOICE	Where's the money, Lebowski!
M	VOICE	WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
M	DUDE	It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
M	VOICE	Don't fuck with us. If your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn.
M	CHINESE MAN	Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.
M	DUDE	Oh, man. Don't do--
M	BLOND MAN	You see what happens? You see what happens, Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Look, nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man.
M	BLOND MAN	Your name is Lebowski. Your wife is Bunny.
M	DUDE	Bunny? Look, moron.
M	DUDE	You see a wedding ring? Does this place look like I'm fucking married? All my plants are dead!
M	BLOND MAN	The fuck is this?
M	DUDE	Obviously you're not a golfer.
M	BLOND MAN	Woo?
M	WOO	Yeah?
M	BLOND MAN	Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
M	WOO	Uh?
M	WOO	Fuck.
M	BLOND MAN	What do you think?
M	WOO	He looks like a fuckin' loser.
M	DUDE	Hey. At least I'm housebroken.
M	WOO	Fuckin' waste of time.
M	BLOND MAN	Thanks a lot, asshole.
M	MAN	Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight. Mark it, Dude.
M	WALTER	This was a valued rug.
M	WALTER	This was, uh--
M	DUDE	Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
M	WALTER	This was a valued, uh.
M	DONNY	What tied the room together, Dude?
M	WALTER	Were you listening to the story, Donny?
M	DONNY	What--
M	WALTER	Were you listening to the Dude's story?
M	DONNY	I was bowling--
M	WALTER	So you have no frame of reference, Donny. You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
M	DUDE	What's your point, Walter?
M	WALTER	There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
M	DONNY	Yeah Walter, what's your point?
M	WALTER	Huh?
M	DUDE	What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
M	WALTER	Huh? No! What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
M	DONNY	What the fuck is he talking about?
M	DUDE	My rug.
M	WALTER	Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element.
M	DUDE	This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
M	WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh... Asian- American. Please.
M	DUDE	Walter, this is not a guy who built the railroads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
M	WALTER	What the fuck are you--
M	DUDE	Walter, he peed on my rug--
M	DONNY	He peed on the Dude's rug--
M	WALTER	YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT! This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
M	DUDE	So who--
M	WALTER	Jeff Lebowski. Come on. This other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two... And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug. Am I wrong?
M	DUDE	No, but--
M	WALTER	Am I wrong!
M	DUDE	Yeah, but--
M	WALTER	Okay. That, uh.
M	WALTER	That rug really tied the room together, did it not?
M	DUDE	Fuckin' A.
M	DONNY	And this guy peed on it.
M	WALTER	Donny! Please!
M	DUDE	Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
M	DONNY	His name is Lebowski? That's your name, Dude!
M	DUDE	Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
M	WALTER	Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug.
M	YOUNG MAN	And this is the study. You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
M	DUDE	Yes, uh, very impressive.
M	YOUNG MAN	Please, feel free to inspect them.
M	DUDE	I'm not really, uh.
M	YOUNG MAN	Please! Please!
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	YOUNG MAN	That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	YOUNG MAN	That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year! Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
M	DUDE	Hey, is this him with Nancy?
M	YOUNG MAN	That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
M	DUDE	Lebowski on the right?
M	YOUNG MAN	Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when--
M	DUDE	He's handicapped, huh?
M	YOUNG MAN	Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
M	DUDE	Far out.
M	YOUNG MAN	And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
M	DUDE	Nancy's pretty good.
M	YOUNG MAN	Wonderful woman. We were very--
M	DUDE	Are these.
M	YOUNG MAN	These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
M	DUDE	Different mothers, huh?
M	YOUNG MAN	No, they--
M	DUDE	I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
M	YOUNG MAN	They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
M	DUDE	I see.
M	YOUNG MAN	--without the means for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski has committed to sending all of them to college.
M	DUDE	Jeez. Think he's got room for one more?
M	YOUNG MAN	One--oh! Heh-heh. You never went to college?
M	DUDE	Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
M	YOUNG MAN	Heh-heh--
M	DUDE	--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
M	YOUNG MAN	Yes, heh--
M	DUDE	--and bowling. I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez! Fuck me!
F	LEBOWSKI	Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very busy so what can I do for you?
M	DUDE	Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
F	LEBOWSKI	You told Brandt on the phone, he told me. So where do I fit in?
M	DUDE	Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
F	LEBOWSKI	I'll say it again, all right? You told Brandt. He told me. I know what happened. Yes? Yes?
M	DUDE	So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
F	LEBOWSKI	Did I urinate on your rug?
M	DUDE	You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
F	LEBOWSKI	Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
M	DUDE	Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
F	LEBOWSKI	Hello! Hello! So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
M	DUDE	Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
F	LEBOWSKI	You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. That, or Duder. His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
F	LEBOWSKI	Are you employed, sir?
M	DUDE	Employed?
F	LEBOWSKI	You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
M	DUDE	Is this a--what day is this?
F	LEBOWSKI	But I do work, so if you don't mind--
M	DUDE	No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man. I mean, if your wife owes--
F	LEBOWSKI	My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
M	DUDE	Ah fuck it.
F	LEBOWSKI	Sure! Fuck it! That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead! Your answer to everything!
F	LEBOWSKI	Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost!
F	LEBOWSKI	...My advice is, do what your parents did! Get a job, sir! The bums will always lose-- do you hear me, Lebowski? THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--
M	HALLWAY	--in a high coffered hallway. Brandt is approaching.
M	BRANDT	How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Okay. The old man told me to take any rug in the house.
M	BRANDT	Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
M	DUDE	It's the LeBaron.
M	BRANDT	Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
M	DUDE	Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Blow on them.
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	G'ahead. Blow.
M	DUDE	You want me to blow on your toes?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Uh-huh... I can't blow that far.
M	DUDE	You sure he won't mind?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Dieter doesn't care about anything. He's a nihilist.
M	DUDE	Practicing?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	You're not blowing.
M	BRANDT	Our guest has to be getting along, Mrs. Lebowski.
M	DUDE	You're Bunny?
F	BUNNY	I'll suck your cock for a thousand dollars.
M	BRANDT	Ha-ha-ha-ha! Wonderful woman. Very free-spirited. We're all very fond of her.
F	BUNNY	Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred.
M	BRANDT	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! That's marvelous.
M	DUDE	I'm just gonna find a cash machine.
M	DONNY	Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in the water!!
M	DUDE	Your maples, Carl.
M	WALTER	Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream.
M	DUDE	You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
M	WALTER	Theodore Herzel.
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	WALTER	State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no--
M	DUDE	What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
M	WALTER	Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
M	DUDE	What the fuck are you--
M	WALTER	I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
M	DUDE	You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
M	WALTER	What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer. He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
M	DUDE	Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself. Why can't she board it?
M	WALTER	First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can't board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out.
M	DUDE	Hey man--
M	WALTER	Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
M	SMOKEY	Huh?
M	WALTER	Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
M	SMOKEY	Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
M	WALTER	Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
M	SMOKEY	Bullshit. Walter!
M	WALTER	This is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.
M	DUDE	Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey. So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
M	WALTER	This is a league game. This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
M	SMOKEY	Yeah, but--
M	WALTER	Am I wrong!?
M	SMOKEY	Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight.
M	WALTER	Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
M	DUDE	Hey Walter--
M	WALTER	Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
M	SMOKEY	I'm not--
M	WALTER	A world of pain.
M	SMOKEY	Look Dude, I don't hold with this. This guy is your partner, you should--
M	WALTER	HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY? AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES? MARK IT ZERO!
M	DUDE	Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
M	WALTER	MARK IT ZERO!
M	SMOKEY	Walter--
M	WALTER	YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
M	SMOKEY	All right! There it is! It's fucking zero!
M	SMOKEY	You happy, you crazy fuck?
M	WALTER	This is a league game, Smokey!
M	DUDE	Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
M	WALTER	You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course--
M	DUDE	And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
M	WALTER	You mean--beyond pacifism?
M	DUDE	He's fragile, man! He's very fragile!
M	WALTER	Huh. I did not know that. Well, it's water under the bridge. And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
M	DUDE	No, you're not wrong--
M	WALTER	Am I wrong!
M	DUDE	You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
M	WALTER	Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They'll be pushovers.
M	DUDE	Just, just take it easy, Walter.
M	WALTER	That's your answer to everything, Dude. And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
M	DUDE	Well, just take 't easy, man.
M	WALTER	I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
M	DUDE	Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?!
M	WALTER	Calmer than you are.
M	DUDE	Just take it easy, man!
M	WALTER	Calmer than you are.
M	VOICE	Dude, this is Smokey. Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round. Or maybe forfeit it to us--
M	DUDE	Shit!
M	VOICE	--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning. Tell Walter.
M	ANOTHER VOICE	Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, well--at Mr. Lebowski's office. Please call us as soon as is convenient.
M	ANOTHER VOICE	Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski with the Southern Cal Bowling League. I just got a, an informal report, uh, that a uh, a member of your team, uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded weapon during league play--
M	DUDE	Hiya Allan.
M	ALLAN	Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted. I'm performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
M	DUDE	Sure Allan, I'll be there.
M	ALLAN	Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
M	DUDE	Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
M	ALLAN	Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
M	DUDE	Yeah, okay.
M	VOICE	--serious infraction, and examine your standing. Thank you. Beep.
M	VOICE	Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again. Please do call us when you get in and I'll send the limo. Let me assure you--I hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug, which, I assure you, is not a problem. We need your help and, uh--well we would very much like to see you. Thank you. It's Brandt.
M	BRANDT	We've had some terrible news. Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
M	DUDE	Huh.
M	BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski.
F	LEBOWSKI	It's funny. I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. What... What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Dude.
F	LEBOWSKI	Huh?
M	DUDE	I don't know, sir.
F	LEBOWSKI	Is it... is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
M	DUDE	Sure. That and a pair of testicles.
F	LEBOWSKI	You're joking. But perhaps you're right.
M	DUDE	Mind if I smoke a jay?
F	LEBOWSKI	Bunny.
M	DUDE	'Scuse me?
F	LEBOWSKI	Bunny Lebowski... She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
M	DUDE	Fuckin' A.
F	LEBOWSKI	Strong men also cry... Strong men also cry.
F	LEBOWSKI	I received this fax this morning.
F	LEBOWSKI	As you can see, it is a ransom note. Sent by cowards. Men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play. Men who will not sign their names. Weaklings. Bums.
M	DUDE	Bummer.
F	LEBOWSKI	Brandt will fill you in on the details.
M	BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
M	DUDE	Why me, man?
M	BRANDT	He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
M	DUDE	So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
M	BRANDT	Well Dude, we just don't know.
M	DUDE	Fucking Quintana--that creep can roll, man--
M	WALTER	Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	WALTER	The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
M	DUDE	Huh.
M	WALTER	When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
M	DONNY	What's a pederast, Walter?
M	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.
M	WALTER	Anyway. How much they offer you?
M	DUDE	Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.
M	WALTER	Just for making the hand-off?
M	DUDE	Yeah.
M	DUDE	...They gave Dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call--
M	WALTER	What if it's during a game?
M	DUDE	I told him if it was during league play--
M	DONNY	If what's during league play?
M	WALTER	Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
M	DONNY	What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
M	DUDE	I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
M	WALTER	Huh?
M	DONNY	What do you mean, Dude?
M	DUDE	Rug-peers did not do this. I mean look at it. Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough. She owes money all over town--
M	WALTER	That... fucking... bitch!
M	DUDE	It's all a goddamn fake. Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit. And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
M	DONNY	I am the Walrus.
M	WALTER	That fucking bitch!
M	DUDE	Yeah.
M	DONNY	I am the Walrus.
M	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
M	DONNY	What the fuck is he talking about?
M	WALTER	That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude! That makes me fucking SICK!
M	DUDE	Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
M	DONNY	Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
M	WALTER	Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing--I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
M	DUDE	I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
M	WALTER	Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
M	DUDE	Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. It's your roll. Have it your way. The point is--
M	DUDE	It's your roll--
M	WALTER	The fucking point is--
M	DUDE	It's your roll.
M	VOICE	Are you ready to be fucked, man?
M	QUINTANA	I see you rolled your way into the semis. Deos mio, man. Seamus and me, we're gonna fuck you up.
M	DUDE	Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man.
M	QUINTANA	Let me tell you something, bendeco. You pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes "click".
M	DUDE	Jesus.
M	QUINTANA	You said it, man. Nobody fucks with the Jesus.
M	WALTER	Eight-year-olds, Dude.
M	DUDE	Oh man.
M	BRANDT	They called about eighty minutes ago. They want you to take the money and drive north on the 405. They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only. What happened to your jaw?
M	DUDE	Oh, nothin', you know.
M	BRANDT	Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	BRANDT	Her life is in your hands.
M	DUDE	Oh, man, don't say that..
M	BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
M	DUDE	Shit.
M	BRANDT	Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
M	WALTER	Take the ringer. I'll drive.
M	DUDE	The what?
M	WALTER	The ringer! The ringer, Dude! Have they called yet?
M	DUDE	What the hell is this?
M	WALTER	My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.
M	DUDE	Agh--
M	DUDE	Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
M	WALTER	Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
M	DUDE	Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
M	WALTER	Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking. I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
M	DUDE	We? What the fuck we? You said you just wanted to come along--
M	WALTER	My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong?
M	DUDE	Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
M	WALTER	It is a fucking game. You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
M	DUDE '	Yeah, but--
M	DUDE	Dude here.
M	VOICE	Who is this?
M	DUDE	Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go?
M	VOICE	...Us?
M	DUDE	Shit... Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver. I'm not handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking--
M	VOICE	Shut the fuck up. Hello?
M	DUDE	Yeah?
M	VOICE	Okay, listen--
M	WALTER	Dude, are you fucking this up?
M	VOICE	Who is that?
M	DUDE	The driver man, I told you--
M	DUDE	Oh shit. Walter.
M	WALTER	What the fuck is going on there?
M	DUDE	They hung up, Walter! You fucked it up! You fucked it up! Her life was in our hands!
M	WALTER	Easy, Dude.
M	DUDE	We're screwed now! We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
M	WALTER	Dude, nothing is fucked. Come on. You're being very unDude. They'll call back. Look, she kidnapped her--
M	WALTER	Ya see? Nothing is fucked up here, Dude. Nothing is fucked. These guys are fucking amateurs--
M	DUDE	Shutup, Walter! Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
M	WALTER	Okay Dude. Have it your way.
M	WALTER	But they're amateurs.
M	DUDE	Dude here.
M	VOICE	Okay, vee proceed. But only if there is no funny stuff.
M	DUDE	Yeah.
M	VOICE	So no funny stuff. Okay?
M	DUDE	Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
M	DUDE	That was the sign.
M	WALTER	Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
M	DUDE	Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
M	WALTER	That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him.
M	WALTER	...Huh?
M	DUDE	Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.
M	WALTER	Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
M	DUDE	Dude.
M	VOICE	You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar. Do not slow down. Vee vatch you.
M	DUDE	FUCK. What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?
M	DUDE	There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out of the car!
M	WALTER	Huh?
M	DUDE	We throw the money out of the moving car!
M	WALTER	We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan.
M	DUDE	Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it! That's the beauty of it Walter!
M	WALTER	Wooden bridge, huh?
M	DUDE	I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
M	WALTER	The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop-chop!
M	DUDE	Fuck that! I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
M	WALTER	Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Here's the bridge--
M	DUDE	Walter!
M	WALTER	Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!
M	DUDE	What the fuck?
M	WALTER	Your wheel! At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out! I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! The uzi!
M	DUDE	Uzi?
M	WALTER	You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
M	DUDE	Walter, please--
M	WALTER	Fifteen! This is it, Dude! Let's take that hill!
M	DUDE	WE HAVE IT! WE HAVE IT!!
M	DUDE	WE HAVE IT!!... We have it!
M	WALTER	Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.
M	WALTER	Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used to say.
M	DUDE	What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
M	WALTER	Huh? Oh, him, yeah. Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
M	DUDE	Huh? The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
M	WALTER	What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude. You said so yourself--
M	DUDE	No, Walter! I said I thought she kidnapped herself! You're the one who's so fucking certain--
M	WALTER	That's right, Dude, I am certain--
M	DONNY	They posted the next round of the tournament--
M	WALTER	Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
M	DONNY	This Saturday. Quintana and--
M	WALTER	Saturday! Well they'll have to reschedule.
M	DUDE	Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
M	WALTER	I told that fuck down at the league office--who's in charge of scheduling?
M	DUDE	Walter--
M	DONNY	Burkhalter.
M	WALTER	I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
M	DONNY	It's already posted.
M	WALTER	WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
M	DUDE	Who gives a shit, Walter? What about that poor woman? What do we tell--
M	WALTER	C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
M	DONNY	How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
M	WALTER	I'm shomer shabbas.
M	DONNY	What's that, Walter?
M	DUDE	Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
M	WALTER	Saturday is shabbas. Jewish day of rest. Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
M	DONNY	Sheesh.
M	DUDE	Walter, how--
M	WALTER	Shomer shabbas.
M	DUDE	That's it. I'm out of here.
M	WALTER	For Christ's sake, Dude.
M	DONNY	Oh yeah, how'd it go?
M	WALTER	Went alright. Dude's car got a little dinged up--
M	DUDE	But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand-off! They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
M	WALTER	Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
M	WALTER	Kill that poor woman.
M	DONNY	Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
M	WALTER	Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit. They're not gonna do shit. What can they do? Fuckin' amateurs. And meanwhile, look at the bottom line. Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
M	DUDE	Walter--
M	WALTER	Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here? "Our" car, Walter? And what do they got, Dude? My dirty undies. My fucking whites--Say, where is the car?
M	DONNY	Who has your undies, Walter?
M	WALTER	Where's your car, Dude?
M	DUDE	You don't know, Walter? You seem to know the answer to everything else!
M	WALTER	Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped spot. It, uh, it was probably towed.
M	DUDE	It's been stolen, Walter! You fucking know it's been stolen!
M	WALTER	Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
M	DUDE	Aw, fuck it.
M	DONNY	Where you going, Dude?
M	DUDE	I'm going home, Donny.
M	DONNY	Your phone's ringing, Dude.
M	DUDE	Thank you, Donny.
M	DUDE	1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
M	YOUNGER COP	Color?
M	DUDE	Green. Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
M	YOUNGER COP	And was there anything of value in the car?
M	DUDE	Huh? Oh. Yeah. Tape deck. Couple of Creedence tapes. And there was a, uh... my briefcase.
M	YOUNGER COP	In the briefcase?
M	DUDE	Papers. Just papers. You know, my papers. Business papers.
M	YOUNGER COP	And what do you do, sir?
M	DUDE	I'm unemployed.
M	OLDER COP	...Most people, we're working nights, they offer us coffee.
M	DUDE	...Me, I don't drink coffee. But it's nice when they offer.
M	DUDE	...Also, my rug was stolen.
M	YOUNGER COP	Your rug was in the car.
M	DUDE	No. Here.
M	YOUNGER COP	Separate incidents?
M	OLDER COP	Snap out of it, son.
M	DUDE	You find them much? Stolen cars?
M	YOUNGER COP	Sometimes. I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though. Or the Creedence tapes.
M	DUDE	And the, uh, the briefcase?
M	FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE	Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you. Call when you get home and I'll send a car for you. My name is Maude Lebowski. I'm the woman who took the rug.
M	OLDER COP	Well, I guess we can close the file on that one.
M	VOICE	I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Lebowski.
M	VOICE	All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow. Elfranco. Pedro. Help me down.
F	MAUDE	Does the female form make you uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Is that what that's a picture of?
F	MAUDE	In a sense, yes. Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.
M	DUDE	Oh yeah?
F	MAUDE	Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
M	DUDE	"Johnson"?
F	MAUDE	Thank you.
F	MAUDE	All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases. My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. Now. As for this... "kidnapping"--
M	DUDE	Huh?
F	MAUDE	Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier. And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
M	DUDE	Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
F	MAUDE	Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Excuse me?
F	MAUDE	Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?
M	DUDE	I was talking about my rug.
F	MAUDE	You're not interested in sex?
M	DUDE	You mean coitus?
F	MAUDE	I like it too. It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
M	DUDE	Oh, no.
F	MAUDE	Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
M	DUDE	Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
F	MAUDE	Take a look at this, sir.
M	DIETER	Hello. Nein dizbatcher says zere iss problem mit deine kable.
M	DUDE	Shit, I know that guy. He's a nihilist.
F	MAUDE	And you recognize her, of course.
F	BUNNY	The TV is in here.
M	DIETER	Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.
F	BUNNY	This is my friend Shari. She just came over to use the shower.
F	MAUDE	The story is ludicrous.
M	DIETER	Mein nommen iss Karl. Is hard to verk in zese clozes--
F	MAUDE	Lord. You can imagine where it goes from here.
M	DUDE	He fixes the cable?
F	MAUDE	Don't be factious, Jeffrey. Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times. However. I am one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father. The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts and--
M	DUDE	Shit yeah, the achievers.
F	MAUDE	Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous. This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.
M	DUDE	Yeah, but my-
F	MAUDE	I'm getting to your rug. My father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
M	DUDE	Well--sure, I could do that--
F	MAUDE	If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 10% of the recovered sum.
M	DUDE	A hundred.
F	MAUDE	Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
M	DUDE	Yeah, but what about--
F	MAUDE	--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
M	DUDE	Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
F	MAUDE	Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man, and thorough.
M	DUDE	That's really thoughtful but I--
F	MAUDE	Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man, and thorough.
M	DRIVER	--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me. I can't complain."
M	DUDE	Fuckin' A, man. I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man. I gotta tell ya Tony.
M	TONY	Aw, forget about it.
M	DUDE	Yeah, man! Fuck it! I can't be worrying about that shit. Life goes on!
M	TONY	Home sweet home, Mr. L. Who's your friend in the Volkswagon?
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	DUDE	When did he-
M	SECOND CHAUFFEUR	Into the limo, you sonofabitch. No arguments.
M	DUDE	Fuck, man! There's a beverage here!
F	LEBOWSKI	Start talking and talk fast you lousy bum!
M	BRANDT	We've been frantically trying to reach you, Dude.
F	LEBOWSKI	Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
M	DUDE	Well we--I don't--
F	LEBOWSKI	They did not receive the money, you nitwit! They did not receive the goddamn money. HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
M	BRANDT	This is our concern, Dude.
M	DUDE	No, man, nothing is fucked here-- NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!
M	DUDE	C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
F	LEBOWSKI	WHAT?!
M	DUDE	I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
F	LEBOWSKI	What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
M	DUDE	I'll tell you what I'm blathering about! I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
M	DUDE	Well sure, look at it! Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool--but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
F	LEBOWSKI	No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
M	BRANDT	That had not occurred to us, Dude.
M	DUDE	Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for. Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
F	LEBOWSKI	Brandt, give him the envelope.
M	DUDE	Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.
M	BRANDT	We received it this morning.
F	LEBOWSKI	Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust.
F	LEBOWSKI	I have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski. And with Brandt as my witness, tell you this: Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head.
F	LEBOWSKI	...By God sir. I will not abide another toe.
M	WALTER	That wasn't her toe.
M	DUDE	Whose toe was it, Walter?
M	WALTER	How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates--
M	DUDE	The nail polish, Walter.
M	WALTER	Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
M	DUDE	Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
M	WALTER	You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
M	DUDE	But Walter--
M	WALTER	I'll get you a toe by this afternoon--with nail polish. These fucking amateurs. They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit ourselves with fear. Jesus Christ. My point is--
M	DUDE	They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
M	WALTER	Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude. So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
M	DUDE	What about the toe?
M	WALTER	FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
F	WAITRESS	Could you please keep your voices down--this is a family restaurant.
M	WALTER	Oh, please dear! I've got news for you: the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!
M	DUDE	Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing.
F	WAITRESS	Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
M	WALTER	Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
M	DUDE	All right, I'm leaving. I'm sorry ma'am.
M	WALTER	Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
M	WALTER	Our basic freedoms!
M	WALTER	I'm staying. Finishing my coffee.
M	WALTER	Finishing my coffee.
M	VOICE THROUGH MACHINE	Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.
M	VOICE THROUGH MACHINE	We've recovered your vehicle. It can be claimed at the North Hollywood Auto Circus there on Victory.
M	DUDE	Far out. Far fuckin' out. You'll just need to present a--

M	POLICEMAN	You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr. Lebowski. Must've been a joyride situation; they abandoned the car once they hit the retaining wall.
M	POLICEMAN	These were on the road next to the car. You'll have to get in on the other side.
M	DUDE	My fucking briefcase! It's not here!
M	POLICEMAN	Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report. You're lucky they left the tape deck though.
M	DUDE	My fucking briefcase! Jesus--what's that smell?
M	POLICEMAN	Uh, yeah. Probably a vagrant, slept in the car. Or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on.
M	DUDE	When will you find these guys? I mean, do you have any promising leads?
M	POLICEMAN	Leads, yeah. I'll just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab. They've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts.
M	DONNY	And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
M	WALTER	Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
M	DUDE	I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
M	WALTER	Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No one is going to cut your dick off.
M	DUDE	Thanks Walter.
M	WALTER	Not if I have anything to say about it.
M	DUDE	Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling.
M	WALTER	Dude--
M	DUDE	That makes me feel all warm inside.
M	WALTER	Now Dude--
M	DUDE	This whole fucking thing--I could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
M	WALTER	Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
M	DONNY	They were Nazis, Dude?
M	WALTER	Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
M	DONNY	Uh-huh.
M	WALTER	Are you gonna split hairs?
M	DONNY	No--
M	WALTER	Am I wrong?
M	DONNY	Well--
M	DUDE	They're nihilists.
M	WALTER	Huh?
M	DUDE	They kept saying they believe in nothing.
M	WALTER	Nihilists! Jesus.
M	WALTER	Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos.
M	DUDE	Yeah.
M	WALTER	And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
M	DUDE	What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
M	WALTER	No, I'm--
M	DUDE	Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
M	WALTER	--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
M	DUDE	Fuck your sympathy! I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
M	DONNY	What do you need that for, Dude?
M	WALTER	You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
M	DUDE	Fuck the tournament! Fuck you, Walter!
M	WALTER	Fuck the tournament?!
M	WALTER	Okay Dude. I can see you don't want to be cheered up. C'mon Donny, let's go get a lane.
M	DUDE	Another Caucasian, Gary.
M	VOICE	Right, Dude.
M	DUDE	Friends like these, huh Gary.
M	GARY	That's right, Dude.
M	MAN	D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?
M	BARTENDER	Sioux City Sarsaparilla.
M	THE STRANGER	That's a good one.
M	THE STRANGER	How ya doin' there, Dude?
M	DUDE	Ahh, not so good, man.
M	THE STRANGER	One a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh. That some kind of Eastern thing?
M	THE STRANGER	Far from it.
M	DUDE	Mm.

M	VOICE	Dude! Dude!
F	MAUDE	Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
M	DUDE	No it's fine, really, uh--
F	MAUDE	Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
M	DUDE	I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
F	MAUDE	She most certainly was not!
M	DUDE	Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally? You might learn something. Now I got--
F	MAUDE	And please don't call her my mother.
M	DUDE	Now I got--
F	MAUDE	She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
M	DUDE	I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
F	MAUDE	From who?
M	DUDE	The main guy, Dieter--
F	MAUDE	Dieter Hauff?
M	DUDE	Well--yeah, I guess--
F	MAUDE	Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
M	DUDE	Beaver? You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
F	MAUDE	Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. under 'Autobahn.'
F	MAUDE	That was his group--they released one album in the mid-seventies.
M	DUDE	Roy Orbison... Pink Floyd.
F	MAUDE	Huh? Autobahn. A-u-t-o. Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
M	DUDE	Jeez. I miss vinyl.
F	MAUDE	Is he pretending to be the abductor?
M	DUDE	Well... yeah--
F	MAUDE	Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with. You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
M	DUDE	Well yeah... I know that.
F	MAUDE	So Dieter has the money?
M	DUDE	Well, no, not exactly. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins. Lotta outs. And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's--
F	MAUDE	Do you still have that doctor's number?
M	DUDE	Huh? No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
F	MAUDE	Please Jeffrey. I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
M	DUDE	Delayed after-eff--
F	MAUDE	I want you to see him immediately.
F	MAUDE	I'll see if he's available. He's a good man, and thorough.
M	VOICE	Could you slide your shorts down please, Mr. Lebowski?
M	DUDE	Huh? No, she, she hit me right here.
M	VOICE	I understand sir. Could you slide your shorts down please?
M	DUDE	Fuck Me.
M	DUDE	Fuckola, man.
M	WALTER	He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
M	DUDE	The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
M	WALTER	Near the In-and-Out Burger--
M	DONNY	Those are good burgers, Walter.
M	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny. This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
M	DUDE	Who the fuck is that?
M	WALTER	Huh?
M	DUDE	Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
M	WALTER	Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
M	DUDE	Yeah.
M	WALTER	All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek?
M	DUDE	Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
M	WALTER	Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	WALTER	The bulk of the series.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	WALTER	Not exactly a lightweight.
M	DUDE	No.
M	WALTER	And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
M	DUDE	Uh.
M	WALTER	Yeah, go figure. Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
M	WALTER	What have you. We'll, uh--
M	DONNY	We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
M	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny. We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already. Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs. Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
M	DUDE	Fuck me, man! That kid's already spent all the money!
M	WALTER	Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Wait in the car, Donny.
F	WOMAN	Jace?
M	WALTER	Hello, Pilar? My name is Walter Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

F	PILAR	No, no. He has healt' problems.
M	WALTER	Uh-huh.
M	WALTER	I just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous--on a personal level, Branded, especially the early episodes, has been a source of, uh, inspir---
F	PILAR	See down, Sweetie. These are the policeman--
M	WALTER	No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly. We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police.
M	WALTER	But that is up to little Larry here. Isn't it, Larry?
M	WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?
M	WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?

M	DUDE	Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
M	WALTER	Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry?
M	DUDE	Is the car out front yours?
M	WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?
M	DUDE	We know it's his fucking homework, Walter! Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
M	WALTER	Look, Larry... Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
M	DUDE	Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
M	WALTER	You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car--
M	DUDE	And the fucking money!
M	WALTER	And the fucking money. And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
M	WALTER	You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.
M	WALTER	Ah, this is pointless.
M	WALTER	All right, Plan B. You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry.
M	WALTER	This is what happens when you FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.
M	WALTER	Fucking language problem, Dude.
M	WALTER	Maybe he'll understand this.
M	WALTER	YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!
M	WALTER	YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!
M	WALTER	THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS!
M	WALTER	HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!
M	WALTER	HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS! FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS!
M	MAN	WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!
M	MAN	I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!
M	WALTER	Hunh?
M	MAN	I KILL JOO, MANG! I--I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
M	DUDE	No! No! NO! THAT'S NOT--
M	MAN	I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
M	MAN	I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
M	MAN	I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
M	DUDE	I accept your apology... No I, I just want to handle it myself from now on... No. That has nothing to do with it... Yes, it made it home, I'm calling from home. No, Walter, it didn't look like Larry was about to crack.
M	DUDE	Well that's your perception... Well you're right, Walter, and the unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE... Yeah, I'll be at practice.
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	WOO	Pin your diapers on, Lebowski. Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
M	BLOND MAN	And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
M	WOO	Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
M	BLOND MAN	You're not dealing with morons here.
M	MAN	Hello Dude, thanks for coming. I'm Jackie Treehorn.
M	DUDE	This is quite a pad you got here, man. Completely unspoiled.
M	TREEHORN	What's your drink, Dude?
M	DUDE	White Russian, thanks. How's the smut business, Jackie?
M	TREEHORN	I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
M	DUDE	Which one was Logjammin'?
M	TREEHORN	Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude. Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
M	TREEHORN	People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
M	DUDE	On you, maybe.
M	TREEHORN	Of course, you do get the good with the bad. The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software. Wave of the future, Dude. 100% electronic.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh. Well, I still jerk off manually.
M	TREEHORN	Of course you do. I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is. Where's Bunny?
M	DUDE	I thought you might know, man.
M	TREEHORN	Me? How would I know? The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
M	DUDE	But she hasn't run off, she's been--
M	TREEHORN	I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it. I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband. That's your business. All I'm saying is, I want mine.
M	DUDE	Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
M	TREEHORN	Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
M	DUDE	Does the Pope shit in the woods?
M	TREEHORN	Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
M	DUDE	Okay, Jackie, done. I like the way you do business. Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies. So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent... of half a million... fifty grand.
M	DUDE	I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.
M	TREEHORN	A fifteen-year-old? Is this your idea of a joke?
M	DUDE	No funny stuff, Jackie... the kid's got it. Hiya, fellas... kid just wanted a car. All the Dude ever wanted... was his rug back... not greedy... it really... Darkness warshed over the Dude-- darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. There was no bottom.
M	DUDE	He was innocent. Not a charge was true. And they say he ran awaaaaaay.
M	CHIEF	This is your only I.D.?
M	DUDE	I know my rights.
M	CHIEF	You don't know shit, Lebowski.
M	DUDE	I want a fucking lawyer, man. I want Bill Kunstler.
M	CHIEF	What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	CHIEF	Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
M	DUDE	That guy treats women like objects, man.
M	CHIEF	Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski. You don't draw shit. We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet. So let me make something plain. I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski. I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk-off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off--do I make myself clear?
M	DUDE	I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
M	DUDE	--Ow! Fucking fascist!
M	CHIEF	Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!
M	CHIEF	Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat! Keep your ugly fucking goldbricking ass out of my beach community!
M	DUDE	Jesus, man, can you change the station?
M	DRIVER	Fuck you man! You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
M	DUDE	I've had a--
M	DRIVER	I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
M	DUDE	--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
M	DRIVER	That's it! Outta this fucking cab!
M	DUDE	Jesus.
F	MAUDE	Jeffrey.
M	DUDE	Maude?
F	MAUDE	Love me.
M	DUDE	That's my robe.
F	MAUDE	Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
M	DUDE	Well, uh... Not much to tell.
M	DUDE	I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
F	MAUDE	Uh-huh.
M	DUDE	Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh... Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
F	MAUDE	Mmnun.
M	DUDE	And then... let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
F	MAUDE	Oh?
M	DUDE	Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.
F	MAUDE	Uh-huh.
M	DUDE	Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
F	MAUDE	What do you do for fun?
M	DUDE	Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.
F	MAUDE	What happened to your house?
M	DUDE	Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
F	MAUDE	Finder's fee?
M	DUDE	He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
F	MAUDE	It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?
M	DUDE	Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
F	MAUDE	Jeffrey--
M	DUDE	It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs. Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber. I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close. It's just--
F	MAUDE	I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.
M	DUDE	Huh? He's fucking loaded.
F	MAUDE	No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
M	DUDE	But your father--he runs stuff, he--
F	MAUDE	We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
M	DUDE	But he's--
F	MAUDE	He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
M	DUDE	Huh. Jeez. Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
F	MAUDE	It increases the chances of conception.
M	DUDE	Increases?
F	MAUDE	Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?
M	DUDE	Well... no, of course not--
F	MAUDE	I want a child.
M	DUDE	Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
F	MAUDE	Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
M	DUDE	Huh...
M	DUDE	So... that doctor.
F	MAUDE	Exactly. What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
M	DUDE	No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary... So your father... Oh man, I get it!
F	MAUDE	What?
M	DUDE	Yeah, my thinking about the case, man, it had become uptight. Yeah. Your father--
M	PHONE VOICE	This is Walter Sobchak. I'm not in; leave a message after the beep.
M	MAUDE'S VOICE	What're you talking about?
M	DUDE	Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone. Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency. I'm not--
M	WALTER	Dude?
M	DUDE	Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
M	WALTER	I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	WALTER	Erev shabbas. I can't drive. I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
M	DUDE	It is a fucking emergency.
M	WALTER	I understand. That's why I picked up the phone.
M	DUDE	THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
M	WALTER	Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
M	DUDE	WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA! COME PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
M	MAUDE'S VOICE	Jeffrey?
M	DUDE	Get out of that fucking car, man!
M	DUDE	Who the fuck are you, man! Come on, man!
M	MAN	Relax, man! No physical harm intended!
M	DUDE	Who the fuck are you? Why've you been following me? Come on, fuckhead!
M	MAN	Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
M	DUDE	Brother Shamus? Like an Irish monk?
M	MAN	Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about? My name's Da Fino! I'm a private snoop! Like you, man!
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	DA FINO	A dick, man! And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
M	DUDE	I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
M	DA FINO	Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
M	DUDE	She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend. I'm just helping her conceive, man!
M	DA FINO	Hey, man, I'm not--
M	DUDE	Who're you working for? Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
M	DA FINO	The Gundersons.
M	DUDE	The? Who the fff--
M	DA FINO	The Gundersons. It's a wandering daughter job. Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
M	DA FINO	See?
M	DUDE	Jesus fucking Christ.
M	DA FINO	Crazy, huh? Ran away a year ago.
M	DA FINO	The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her. The family farm.
M	DA FINO	Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota. They think it'll make her homesick.
M	DUDE	Boy. How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.
M	DUDE	She's been kidnapped, Da Fino. Or maybe not, but she's definitely not around.
M	DA FINO	Fuck, man! That's terrible!
M	DUDE	Yeah, it sucks.
M	DA FINO	Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
M	DUDE	Yeah, I get it. Fuck off, Da Fino. And stay away from my special la-- from my fucking lady friend.
F	WAITRESS	You folks ready?
M	DIETER	I haff lingenberry pancakes.
M	KIEFFER	Lingenberry pancakes.
F	FRANZ	Sree picks in blanket.
M	DIETER	Lingenberry pancakes.
M	DUDE	I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off. And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything. Huh?
M	WALTER	Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
M	DUDE	I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man! He's had enough! He no longer digs her! It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
M	WALTER	What's your point, Dude?
M	DUDE	His million bucks was never in it, man! There was no money in that briefcase! He was hoping they'd kill her! You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
M	WALTER	Yeah?
M	DUDE	Shit yeah!
M	WALTER	Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
M	DUDE	Huh?
M	WALTER	I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
M	DUDE	Walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
M	WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about?
M	DUDE	You're fucking Polish Catholic--
M	WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
M	DUDE	Yeah, and you were--
M	WALTER	You know this!
M	DUDE	And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
M	WALTER	Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?
M	DUDE	This driveway.
M	WALTER	I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
M	DUDE	It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past.
M	WALTER	Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST! I--Jesus. What the hell happened?
M	WALTER	Jesus Christ.
M	BRANDT	He can't see you, Dude.
M	DUDE	Where'd she been?
M	BRANDT	Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs. Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
M	DUDE	But I guess she told Dieter.
M	WALTER	Jesus, Dude! He never even kidnapped her.
M	BRANDT	Who's this gentleman, Dude?
M	WALTER	Who'm I? I'm a fucking VETERAN!
M	BRANDT	You shouldn't go in there, Dude! He's very angry!
F	LEBOWSKI	Well, she's back. No thanks to you.
M	DUDE	Where's the money, Lebowski?
M	WALTER	A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS! YOU ARE SCUM, MAN!
F	LEBOWSKI	Who the hell is he?
M	WALTER	I'll tell you who I am! I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
M	DUDE	We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
F	LEBOWSKI	Well, you have your story, I have mine. I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
M	WALTER	AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
M	DUDE	You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear. All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me. You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
F	LEBOWSKI	Well? Aren't you?
M	DUDE	Well... yeah.
F	LEBOWSKI	All right, get out. Both of you.
M	WALTER	Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
F	LEBOWSKI	I said out. Now.
M	WALTER	Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker.
M	WALTER	This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
F	LEBOWSKI	Stay away from me, mister!
M	WALTER	Walk, you fucking phony!
F	LEBOWSKI	Put me down, you son of a bitch!
M	DUDE	Walter!
M	WALTER	It's all over, man! We call your fucking bluff!
M	DUDE	WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN!
M	WALTER	Sure, I'll put him down, Dude. RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
M	WALTER	Oh, shit.
F	LEBOWSKI	You're bullies! Cowards, both of you!
M	WALTER	Oh, shit.
M	DUDE	He can't walk, Walter!
M	WALTER	Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
F	LEBOWSKI	You monsters!
M	DUDE	Help me put him back in his chair.
M	WALTER	Shit, sorry man.
F	LEBOWSKI	Stay away from me! You bullies! You and these women! You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
M	DUDE	Walter, you fuck!
M	WALTER	Shit, Dude, I didn't know. I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
M	DUDE	We're sorry, man. We're really sorry.
M	DUDE	There ya go. Sorry man.
M	WALTER	Shit. He didn't look like a spinal.
M	WALTER	Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
M	DUDE	Uh-huh.
M	WALTER	I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk. I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
M	DUDE	Yeah.
M	WALTER	That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary.
M	DONNY	Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
M	WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny. Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank. This is not a worthy--
M	VOICE	HEY!

M	DUDE	Then what's...
M	WALTER	It's a heart attack.
M	DUDE	Wha.
M	WALTER	Call the medics, Dude.
M	DUDE	Wha... Donny--

M	MAN	Hello, gentlemen. You are the bereaved?
M	DUDE	Yeah man.
M	MAN	Francis Donnelly. Pleased to meet you.
M	DUDE	Jeffrey Lebowski.
M	WALTER	Walter Sobchak.
M	DUDE	The Dude, actually. Is what, uh.
M	DONNELLY	Excuse me?
M	DUDE	Nothing.
M	DONNELLY	Yes. I understand you're taking away the remains.
M	WALTER	Yeah.
M	DONNELLY	We have the urn.
M	DONNELLY	And I assume this is credit card?
M	WALTER	Yeah.
M	WALTER	What's this?
M	DONNELLY	That is for the urn.
M	WALTER	Don't need it. We're scattering the ashes.
M	DONNELLY	Yes, so we were informed. However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
M	WALTER	This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
M	DONNELLY	Yes sir. It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
M	DUDE	Well can we--
M	WALTER	A hundred and eighty dollars?!
M	DONNELLY	They range up to three thousand.
M	WALTER	Yeah, but we're--
M	DUDE	Can we just rent it from you?
M	DONNELLY	Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
M	WALTER	We're scattering the fucking ashes!
M	DUDE	Walter--
M	WALTER	JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
M	DONNELLY	Sir, please lower your voice--
M	DUDE	Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
M	DONNELLY	That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
M	WALTER	GODDAMNIT! IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND HERE?!
M	WALTER	I'll say a few words.
M	WALTER	Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was... He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern California from Redondo to Calabassos. And he was an avid bowler. And a good friend. He died--he died as so many of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom you took him, Lord. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc and Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And Donny too. Donny who... who loved bowling.
M	WALTER	And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of...
M	WALTER	the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well.
M	WALTER	Goodnight, sweet prince.
M	WALTER	Shit, I'm sorry Dude.
M	WALTER	Goddamn wind.
M	DUDE	Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole!
M	WALTER	Dude! Dude, I'm sorry!
M	DUDE	You make everything a fucking travesty!
M	WALTER	Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
M	DUDE	What about that shit about Vietnam!
M	WALTER	Dude, I'm sorry--
M	DUDE	What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?!
M	WALTER	Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
M	DUDE	You're a fuck, Walter!
M	WALTER	Awww, fuck it Dude. Let's go bowling.
M	DUDE	Two oat sodas, Gary.
M	GARY	Right. Good luck tomorrow.
M	DUDE	Thanks, man.
M	GARY	Sorry to hear about Donny.
M	DUDE	Yeah. Well, you know, sometimes you eat the bear, and, uh...
M	THE STRANGER	Howdy do, Dude.
M	DUDE	Oh, hey man, how are ya? I wondered if I'd see you again.
M	THE STRANGER	Wouldn't miss the semis. How things been goin'?
M	DUDE	Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
M	THE STRANGER	Sure, I gotcha.
M	DUDE	Thanks, Gary... Take care, man, I gotta get back.
M	THE STRANGER	Sure. Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
M	DUDE	Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides.
M	THE STRANGER	The Dude abides.
M	THE STRANGER	I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I sure hope he makes the finals.
