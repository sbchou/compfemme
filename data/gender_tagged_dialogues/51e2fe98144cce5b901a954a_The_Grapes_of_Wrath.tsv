M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	WAITRESS	When you be back?
M	DRIVER	Couple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about!
M	TOM	How about a lift, mister?
M	DRIVER	Can't you see that sticker?
M	TOM	Sure I see it. But a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.
M	DRIVER	Scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.
M	DRIVER	Goin' far?
M	TOM	Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
M	DRIVER	Lookin' for a job?
M	TOM	No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
M	DRIVER	Oh!
M	DRIVER	Been doin' a job?
M	TOM	Yeah.
M	DRIVER	I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time. Got a trade?
M	TOM	Why don't you get to it, buddy?
M	DRIVER	Get to what?
M	TOM	You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
M	DRIVER	I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
M	TOM	Naw--not much!
M	DRIVER	I stay in my own yard.
M	TOM	Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
M	DRIVER	You ain't got to get sore.
M	TOM	Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
M	DRIVER	I didn't mean nothing.
M	TOM	Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all. See that road up ahead?
M	DRIVER	Yeah.
M	TOM	That's where I get off.
M	TOM	You're about to bust to know what I done, ain't you? Well, I ain't a guy to let you down. Homicide!
M	DRIVER	I never asked you!
M	TOM	Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
M	CASY	Mmmmm he's my saviour. Mmmmm my saviour, Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now. Howdy, friend.
M	TOM	Howdy.
M	CASY	Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
M	TOM	Yeah. On my way home now.
M	CASY	Well, I do declare! I baptized you, son.
M	TOM	Why, you're the preacher!
M	CASY	*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call. But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em! But not no more. I lost the sperit.
M	TOM	Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
M	CASY	I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
M	TOM	Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
M	CASY	At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
M	TOM	I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
M	CASY	But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls. I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes! So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
M	TOM	percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion, pulls Have a little snort?
M	CASY	Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food-- --but my heart ain't in it. Nice drinkin' liquor.
M	TOM	Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
M	CASY	Been out travelin' around?
M	TOM	Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
M	CASY	No, I never. What?
M	TOM	I been in the penitentiary for four years.
M	CASY	Excuse me for asking.
M	TOM	I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
M	CASY	And you ain't ashamed?
M	TOM	He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
M	CASY	Ain't you seen your folks since then?
M	TOM	No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
M	CASY	It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other. I'll go your way.
M	TOM	Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
M	CASY	I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
M	TOM	Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
M	CASY	Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
M	CASY	Is it fur?
M	TOM	Just around that next bend.
M	CASY	Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
M	TOM	That's our place.
M	CASY	And it ain't any too close, either! We better run!
M	TOM'S VOICE	Ma?... Pa?... Ain't nobody here? Somepin's happened.
M	CASY'S VOICE	You got a match?
M	TOM'S VOICE	There was some pieces of candle always on a shelf.
M	TOM	They're all gone--or dead.
M	CASY	They never wrote you nothing?
M	TOM	No. They wasn't people to write.
M	TOM	This was Ma's. Had 'em for years.
M	TOM	This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away. You reckon they could be dead?
M	CASY	I never heard nothin' about it.
F	MULEY	Tommy?
M	TOM	Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
F	MULEY	They gone.
M	TOM	I know that! But *where* they gone?
M	TOM	This is Muley Graves. You remember the preacher, don't you?
M	CASY	I ain't no preacher anymore.
M	TOM	All right, you remember the *man* then.
M	MULEY AND CASY	Glad to see you again. Glad to see you.
M	TOM	Now where is my folks?
F	MULEY	Gone-- --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
M	TOM	But what's happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
F	MULEY	Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks. Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
M	TOM	But who done it?
F	MULEY	Listen! That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
M	TOM	Are you crazy?
F	MULEY	Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
M	TOM	That's what I asked you, ain't it?
F	MULEY	The way it happens--the way it happened to me--the man come one day...
M	THE MAN	Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
F	MULEY	But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now. The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
M	THE MAN	I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
F	MULEY	You mean get off my own land?
M	THE MAN	Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
M	SON	Whose fault is it?
M	THE MAN	You know who owns the land--the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.
F	MULEY	Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
M	THE MAN	It ain't nobody. It's a company.
M	SON	They got a pres'dent, ain't they? They got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they?
M	THE MAN	But it ain't *his* fault, because the *bank* tells him what to do.
M	SON	All right. Where's the bank?
M	THE MAN	Tulsa. But what's the use of picking on him? He ain't anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying to keep up with his orders from the east!
F	MULEY	Then who *do* we shoot?
M	THE MAN	Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
F	MULEY	Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
M	TOM	Well?
F	MULEY	They come. They come and pushed me off.
F	MULEY	They come with the cats.
M	TOM'S VOICE	The what?
F	MULEY	The cats--the caterpillar tractors.
M	MULEY'S VOICE	And for ever' one of 'em ten-fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes--one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road. The Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses, the Joadses--one after another they got throwed out. Half the folks you and me know--throwed right out into the road. The one that got me come a month ago.
F	MULEY	You come any closer and I'm gonna blow you right outa that cat!
F	MULEY	I *tol'* you!
F	MULEY	Why, you're Joe Davis's boy!
M	DAVIS	I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
F	MULEY	Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
M	DAVIS	For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
F	MULEY	But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
M	DAVIS	*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
F	GIRL	What's he fixin' to do, ma?
F	MA	Hush!
F	MULEY	Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
M	DAVIS	You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
F	WIFE	Don't! Please don't!
F	MULEY	I'm tellin' you!
F	MULEY	What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
M	TOM	But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
F	MULEY	The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
F	MULEY	You think I'm touched.
M	CASY	No. You're lonely--but you ain't touched.
F	MULEY	It don't matter. If I'm touched, I'm touched, and that's all there is to it.
M	TOM	What I can't understand is my folks takin' it! Like ma! I seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken. She aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand but she got mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got through with that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs.
F	MULEY	Just a plain 'ol graveyard ghost, that's all.
M	TOM	She's settlin'.
M	CASY	What you figger to do?
M	TOM	It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
F	MULEY	Listen! That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
M	TOM	Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
F	MULEY	You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
M	CASY	Come on, Tom. You're on parole.
F	MULEY	All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
M	TOM	Won't they come out here?
F	MULEY	I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
M	MAN	Muley? He ain't here.
M	TOM	Anybody ever 'tol me I'd be hidin' out on my own place...!
M	MA'S VOICE	Lord, make us thankful for what we are about to receive, for His sake. Amen.
M	GRANMA	I seen you!--You et durin' grace!
M	GRAMPA	One little ole dab!--one teeny little ole dab!
M	RUTHIE	Ain't he messy though!
M	GRANMA	I seen him!--gobblin' away like an ole pig!
M	GRAMPA	Whyn't you keep your eyes shet durin' grace, you ole...
M	NOAH	What's it say again?
M	JOHN	Says plenty work in California-- peaches. Eight hundred pickers needed.
M	GRAMPA	Wait'll I get to California! Gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever I want it! Or grapes. That there's somethin' I ain't *never* had enough of! Gonna get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush and I'm gonna squash 'em all over my face and just let the juice dreen down offen my chin!
M	GRANMA	Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!
M	GRAMPA	Maybe I get me a whole *washtub* fulla them grapes and jest sit in 'em and scrooge around till they was gone! I shore would like to do that!
M	RUTHIE	Look. I'm Grampa!
F	MA	Thank God. Oh thank God. Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
M	TOM	No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
F	MA	I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
M	TOM	I'd a found you, Ma.
M	TOM	Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
F	MA	We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy. Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
M	TOM	Mad, Ma?
F	MA	Sometimes they do.
M	TOM	No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
F	MA	Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
M	TOM	No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
F	MA	Thank God. I--I don't want no mean
M	son	
M	PA	It's Tommy! It's Tommy back! What'd you do, son--bust out?
M	WINFIELD AND RUTHIE	Tom's outa ja-ul! Tom's outa ja-ul!
M	GRAMPA	I knowed it! Couldn't keep him in! Can't keep a Joad in! I knowed it from the fust!
M	GRANMA	Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!
M	GRAMPA	You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
M	TOM	I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
M	NOAH AND JOHN	Fine, Tommy. Glad to see you.
M	GRAMPA	I was the same way myself. Put me in jail and I'd bust right out. Couldn't hold me!
M	NOAH	Bust out?
M	TOM	Parole.
M	AL AND ROSASHARN	Hi, Tom! Howya doin'?
M	TOM	Rosasharn! Hi, Rosasharn! Howya, Al!
M	GRAMPA	The jailbird's back! The jailbird's back!
M	OMNES	Hi, Ma! Hi, Connie! Hiya, Grampa!
M	PA	That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now. She's due about three-four months.
M	TOM	Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
M	AL	You bust outa jail, Tom?
M	TOM	Naw. They paroled me.
M	AL	Oh.
F	ROSASHARN	Heh'o Tom. This is Connie, my husband.
M	TOM	If this don't beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!
F	ROSASHARN	You do not see either!--not yet!
M	OMNES	Lookut his face! Y'see his face? Lookut Rosasharn! Y'ever see anything like her face when Tom said it? Look around, Rosasharn! Let's see it again!
M	MAN	Hey, Joad! John Joad!
M	MAN	Ain't forgot, have you?
M	JOHN	We ain't forgot.
M	MAN	Comin' through here tomorrow, you know.
M	JOHN	I know. We be out. We be out by sunup.
M	TOM	How you get all this money?
M	PA	Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
M	TOM	Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
M	AL	She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
M	PA	Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'?
M	TOM	How about it, Ma?
F	MA	I'm ready.
F	MA	Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. We're fixin' to leave.
M	PA	Where's Grampa? Al, go git him.
M	GRANMA	I'm gonna sit up front! Somebody he'p me!
M	RUTHIE AND WINFIELD	Goin' to California! Goin' to California!
M	PA	You kids climb up first, on top. Al's gonna drive, Ma. You sit up there with him and Granma and we'll swap around later.
M	GRANMA	I ain't gonna sit with Grampa!
M	PA	Connie, you he'p Rosasharn up there alongside Ruthie and Winfiel'. Where's Grampa?
M	GRANMA	Where he al'ays is, prob'ly!
M	PA	Well, leave him a place, but Noah, you and John, y'all kinda find yourself a place--kinda keep it even all around.
M	TOM	Think she'll hold?
M	CASY	If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
M	GRAMPA'S VOICE	Lemmo go, gol dang it! Lemmo go, I tell you!
M	AL	He wasn't sleepin'. He was settin' out back a the barn. They's somepin' wrong with him.
M	GRAMPA	Ef you don't let me go--
M	TOM	What's the matter, Grampa?
M	GRAMPA	Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
M	PA	What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
M	GRAMPA	I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
M	PA	But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
M	GRAMPA	All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
M	TOM	How 'bout Granma?
M	GRAMPA	Take her with you!
F	MA	But who'd cook for you? How'd you live?
M	GRAMPA	Muley's livin', ain't he? And I'm *twicet* the man Muley is!
M	PA	Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
M	GRAMPA	And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do. And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California! This here's my country. I b'long *here*. It ain't no good-- --but it's mine.
M	TOM	Ma. Pa. Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
M	GRAMPA	And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
M	TOM	Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
M	PA	Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self. Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
M	TOM	Ain't no whisky, is they?
F	MA	Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here. It put the chillun to sleep.
M	TOM	Don't taste bad.
F	MA	And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
M	TOM	That's right. And douse some in it.
M	PA	Better give him a good 'un. He's awful bull-headed.
M	GRAMPA	If Muley can scrabble along, I can do it too. I smell spareribs. Somebody been eatin' spareribs? How come I ain't got some?
F	MA	Got some saved for you, Grampa. Got 'em warmin' now. Here's a cuppa coffee.
M	GRAMPA	Awright, but get me some a them spareribs, too. Get me a whole mess of 'em. I'm hongry.
M	GRAMPA	I shore do like spareribs.
M	PA	Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
M	GRAMPA	Ain't a-goin', thas all...
M	PA	Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck. Ever'body set now? Awright, Al, letta go!
M	PA	You be awright, Grampa.
M	CASY	Good-by, an' good luck.
M	PA	Hey, wait! Hold 'er, Al! Ain't you goin' with us?
M	CASY	I'd like to. There's somethin' happenin' out there in the wes' an' I'd like to try to learn what it is. If you feel you got the room...
M	PA	Come on, get on, plenty room!
M	OMNES	Sure, come on, Casy, plenty room!
M	PA	Here we go!
M	TOM	California, here we come!
M	AL	Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
F	MA	We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
M	AL	That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
F	MA	I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
M	GRAMPA	*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
M	TOM	'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
M	GRAMPA	Thas it, jus' tar'd thas all... jus' tar'd...
M	TOM'S VOICE	This here is William James Joad, dyed of a stroke, old old man. His folkes bured him becaws they got no money to pay for funerls. Nobody kilt him. Jus a stroke an he dyed.
M	TOM	I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt. Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
M	PA	Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
M	TOM	Casy, won't you say a few words?
M	CASY	I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
M	TOM	We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
M	CASY	I'll say 'em--an' make it short. This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.
M	OMNES	Amen.
F	MA	Tommy.
M	TOMMY	What is it, Ma?
F	MA	Wasn't that the state line we just passed?
M	TOM	Yes'm, that was it.
F	MA	Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
M	TOM	Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
F	MA	Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
M	TOM	Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
M	GRANMA	I gotta git out!
M	TOM	First gas station, Granma--
M	GRANMA	I gotta git *out*, I tell ya! I gotta git *out*!
M	TOM	Awright! Awright!
M	TOM	They shore don't waste no time! Take her out.
M	COP	Save your strength, lady. Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
M	TOM	We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
M	COP	Lissen, I heard that before--
M	GRANMA	I tell ya I gotta git out!
M	TOM	She's kinda ol'--
M	GRANMA	I tell ya--
M	COP	Okay, okay!
M	GRANMA	Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory!
F	ROSASHARN	Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
F	MA	Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
F	ROSASHARN	Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
F	MA	Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
F	ROSASHARN	But will it--hurt the baby?
F	MA	They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
F	ROSASHARN	You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
F	MA	Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n-- --I'll do it.
F	ROSASHARN	Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
F	MA	No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
M	PA	Thas my son-in-law.
M	FIRST MAN	Sings real nice. What state y'all from?
M	PA	Oklahoma. Had us a farm there, share- croppin'.
M	TOM	Till the tractors druv us out.
M	FIRST MAN	We from Arkansas. I had me a store there, kind of general notions store, but when the farms went the store went too. Nice a little as you ever saw. I shore did hate to give it up.
M	PA	Wal, y'cain't tell. I figure when we git out there an' git work an' maybe git us a piece a growin' lan' near water it might not be so bad at that.
M	OTHER MEN	Thas right... Payin' good wages, I hear... Ever'body got work out there... Can't be no worse...
M	SECOND MAN	You folks must have a pot a money.
M	PA	No, we ain't got no money. But they's plenty of us to work, an' we 're all good men. Get good wages out there an' put it all together an' we'll be awright.
M	SECOND MAN	Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
M	PA	We gonna take whatever they got.
M	TOM	What's so funny about it?
M	SECOND MAN	What's so funny about it? I just *been* out there! I been an' *seen* it! An' I'm goin' *back* to starve-- because I ruther starve all over at once!
M	PA	Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
M	SECOND MAN	Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
M	PA	But what about this?
M	SECOND MAN	I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
M	TOM	Wait a minute, buddy. You jus' done some jackassin'! You ain't gonna shut up now. The han'bill says they need men. You laugh an' say they don't. Now which one's a liar?
M	SECOND MAN	How many you'all got them han'bills? Come on, how many?
M	PA	But what does *that* prove?
M	SECOND MAN	Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
M	PROPRIETOR	What are you, a troublemaker? You sure you ain't one a them labor fakes?
M	SECOND MAN	I swear I ain't, mister!
M	PROPRIETOR	Well, don't you go roun' here tryin' to stir up trouble.
M	SECOND MAN	I tried to tell you folks sump'n it took me a year to fin' out. Took two kids dead, took my wife dead, to show me. But nobody couldn't tell me neither. I can't tell ya about them little fellas layin' in the tent with their bellies puffed out an' jus' skin on their bones, an' shiverin' an' whinin' like pups, an' me runnin' aroun' tryin' to get work-- --not for money, not for wages--jus' for a cup a flour an' a spoon a lard! An' then the coroner came. "Them children died a heart-failure," he says, an' put it in his paper. Heart-failure!--an' their little bellies stuck out like a pig-bladder!
M	FIRST MAN	Well--gettin' late. Got to get to sleep.
M	PA	S'pose he's tellin' the truth--that fella?
M	CASY	He's tellin' the truth awright. The truth for him. He wasn't makin' nothin' up.
M	TOM	How about us? Is that the truth for us?
M	CASY	I don't know.
M	PA	How can you tell?
M	FAT MAN	You folks aim to buy anything?
M	AL	Need some gas, mister.
M	FAT MAN	Got any money?
M	AL	Whatta you think:--we's beggin'?
M	FAT MAN	I just ast, that's all.
M	TOM	Well, ask right. You ain't talkin' to bums, you know.
M	FAT MAN	All in the worl' I done was ast!
M	BILL	Kinda pie y'got?
F	MAE	Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
M	BILL	Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
M	FRED	Make it two.
F	MAE	Two it is. Seen any new etchin's lately, Bill?
M	BILL	Well, here's one ain't bad. Little kid comes in late to school. Teacher says--
F	MAE	Yeah?
M	PA	Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
F	MAE	This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
M	PA	I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
F	MAE	Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
M	PA	I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
F	MAE	You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
M	BERT	Give 'em the bread.
F	MAE	We'll run out 'fore the bread truck comes.
M	BERT	Awright then, run out!
F	MAE	Come in.
F	MAE	This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
M	PA	Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
M	BERT	Give 'im the loaf!
M	PA	No, sir, we wanta buy ten cents worth, thas all.
F	MAE	You can have this for ten cents.
M	PA	I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
F	MAE	Go ahead--Bert says take it.
M	PA	May soun' funny to be so tight, but we got a thousan' miles to go, an' we don't know if we'll make it.
M	PA	Is them penny candy, ma'am?
F	MAE	Which ones?
M	PA	There, them stripy ones.
F	MAE	Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
M	PA	Well, give me two then, ma'am.
M	PA	Sure, take 'em, take 'em!
M	PA	Thank you, ma'am.
M	BILL	Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
F	MAE	What's it to you?
M	BILL	Them was nickel apiece candy.
M	FRED	We got to get goin'. We're droppin' time.
M	BILL	So long.
F	MAE	Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
M	BILL'S VOICE	What's it to you?
F	MAE	Bert.
M	BERT	What ya want?
F	MAE	Look here.
F	MAE	Truck drivers.
M	BERT	I figgered No. 3 was about ready to pay off.
M	GUARD	Where you going?
M	TOM	California.
M	GUARD	How long you plan to be in Arizona?
M	TOM	No longer'n we can get acrost her.
M	GUARD	Got any plants?
M	TOM	No plants.
M	GUARD	Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
M	TOM	Sure. We aim to.
M	PA	There she is, folks--the land a milk an' honey--California!
M	CONNIE	Well, if *that's* what we come out here for...
F	ROSASHARN	Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
M	TOM	Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
M	PA	Course not. Come on, let's get goin'. She don't look so tough to me!
M	TOM	Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
M	PA	How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
M	AL	She's off her chump, seems to me.
M	NOAH	She's outa her senses, awright. All night on the truck keep talkin' like she was talkin' to Grampa.
M	TOM	She's jus' wore out, that's all.
M	PA	I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
M	NOAH	Like to jus' stay here myself. Like to lay here forever. Never get hungry an' never get sad. Lay in the water all life long, lazy as a brood sow in the mud.
M	TOM	Never seen such tough mountains. This here's a murder country, just the *bones* of a country. Wonder if we'll ever get in a place where folks can live 'thout fightin' hard scrabble an' rock. Sometimes you get to thinkin' they *ain't* no such country.
M	MAN	How's the swimmin'?
M	TOM	Dunno. We ain't tried none. Sure feels good to set here, though.
M	MAN	Mind if we come in an' set?
M	TOM	She ain't our river. But we'll len' you a little piece of her.
M	PA	Goin' west?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Nope. We come from there. Goin' back home.
M	TOM	Where's home?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Panhandle, come from near Pampa.
M	PA	Can you make a livin' there?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Nope.
M	MAN	But at leas' we can starve to death with folks we know.
M	PA	Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
M	TOM	Me an' you both.
M	SON	He ain't gonna tell you nothin' about it.
M	PA	If a fella's willin' to work hard, can't he cut her?
M	MAN	Listen, mister. I don't know ever'thing. You might go out an' fall into a steady job, an' I'd be a liar. An' then, you might never get no work, an' I didn't warn you. All I can tell ya, most of the folks is purty mis'able. But a fella don't know ever'thing.
M	PA	John, you never was a fella to say much, but I'll be goldanged if you opened your mouth twicet since we lef' home. What you think about this?
M	JOHN	I don't think *nothin'* about it. We're a-goin' there, ain't we? When we get there, we'll get there. When we get a job, we'll work, an' when we don't get a job we'll set on our behin's. That's all they is to it, ain't it?
M	TOM	Uncle John don't talk much but when he does he shore talks sense.
M	FIRST BOY	You people got a lotta nerve.
M	TOM	What you mean?
M	FIRST BOY	Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
M	TOM	You been acrost?
M	FIRST BOY	Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
M	TOM	If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
M	FIRST BOY	Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
M	TOM	It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do.
F	MA	Don't you worry, Granma. It's gonna be awright.
M	GRANMA	Grampa... Grampa... I want Grampa...
F	MA	Don't you fret now.
M	FIRST BOY	Holy Moses, what a hard-lookin' outfit!
M	SECOND BOY	All them Okies is hard-lookin'.
M	FIRST BOY	Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert in a jalopy like that!
M	SECOND BOY	Well, you and me got sense. Them Okies got no sense or no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so miserable.
M	FIRST BOY	Just don't know any better, I guess. What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
M	TOM	People done it. If they could, we could.
M	AL	Lots must a died, too.
M	TOM	Well, we ain't out a it yet.
M	RUTHIE	This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
M	WINFIELD	I wisht it was day.
M	RUTHIE	Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you. I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
M	WINFIELD	Man bones?
M	RUTHIE	Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
F	MA	'S awright, honey. Everything's gonna be awright.
F	ROSASHARN	Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
M	CONNIE	Women is always tar'd.
F	ROSASHARN	You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
M	CONNIE	No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
F	ROSASHARN	But we can still do it, honey.
M	CONNIE	I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
F	MA	We can't give up, honey. The family's got to get acrost. You know that.
M	JOHN'S VOICE	Ever'thing all right?
F	MA	Yes, ever'thing's all right. I--I guess I dropped off to sleep.
M	TOM	What's this here?
M	OFFICER	Agricultural inspection. We got to go over your stuff. Got any vegetables or seed?
M	TOM	No.
M	OFFICER	Well, we got to look over your stuff. You got to unload.
F	MA	Look, mister. We got a sick ol' lady. We got to get her to a doctor. We can't wait. You can't make us wait!
M	OFFICER	Yeah? Well, we got to look you over.
F	MA	I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it. An' Granma's awful sick. Look!
M	OFFICER	You wasn't foolin'! You swear you got no fruit or vegetables?
F	MA	No, I swear it.
M	OFFICER	Then go ahead. You can get a doctor at Barstow. That's just eight miles. But don't stop. Don't get off. Understand?
M	TOM	Okay, cap. Much oblige.
F	MA	Tell Tom he don't have to stop. Granma's all right.
M	AL	Will ya look at her!
M	PA	I never knowed they was anything like her!
M	TOM	Where's Ma? I want Ma to see it. Look, Ma! Come here, Ma!
M	TOM	Ma, you sick?
F	MA	Ya say we're acrost?
M	TOM	Look, Ma!
F	MA	Thank God! An' we're still together-- most of us.
M	TOM	Didn' you get no sleep?
F	MA	No.
M	TOM	Was Granma bad?
F	MA	Granma's dead.
M	TOM	When?
F	MA	Since before they stopped us las' night.
M	TOM	An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
F	MA	I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
F	MA	So it's all right. At leas' she'll get buried in a nice green place. Trees and flowers aroun'. She got to lay her head down in California after all.
M	POLICEMAN	How far you figger you gonna get *this* way?
M	TOM	Right here. We give out a gas.
M	TOM	Where's the bes' place to get some work aroun' here? Don't matter what kin' either.
M	POLICEMAN	If I seen one a them things I must a seen ten thousan'.
M	PA	Ain't it no good?
M	POLICEMAN	Not here--not now. Month ago there was some pickin' but it's all moved south now. Where'bouts in Oklahoma you from?
M	TOM	Sallisaw.
M	POLICEMAN	I come out from Cherokee County--two years ago.
F	ROSASHARN	Why, Connie's folks from Cherokee County--
M	POLICEMAN	Okay, ma'am, let's don't go into it. I already met about a hundred firs' cousins an' it mus' be five hundred secon'. But this is what I got to tell you, don't try to park in town tonight. Keep on out to that camp. If we catch you in town after dark we got to lock you up. Don't forget.
M	PA	But what we gonna *do*?
M	POLICEMAN	Pop, that just ain't up to me. But I don't min' tellin' you, the guy they *ought* to lock up is the guy that sent out *them* things.
M	ATTENDANT	How many, folks?
M	AL	One.
M	TOM	She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
F	MA	On a gallon a gas? Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
F	GIRL	I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
F	MA	You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
F	GIRL	Yes, ma'am.
F	MA	Didn' you have no breakfast?
F	GIRL	No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
F	MA	Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
M	BOY	I did. Me an' my brother did. We et good.
F	MA	Then you ain't hungry, are you?
M	BOY	We et good.
F	MA	Well, it's a good thing *some* a you ain't hungry, because they ain't enough to go all the way roun'.
F	GIRL	Aw, he was braggin'. Know what he done? Las' night, come out an' say they got chicken to eat. Well, sir, I looked in whilst they was a-eatin' an' it was fried dough jus' like ever'body else.
M	PA	How 'bout it?
F	MA	Go get Tom an' Al. I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
M	JOHN	You take this. I ain't hungry.
M	TOM	Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
M	JOHN	I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
M	TOM	You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
M	JOHN	Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
M	TOM	You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
F	MA	We can't send 'em away. Take your plates an' go inside. Take a plate to Rosasharn. Look. You little fellas go an' get you each a flat stick an' I'll put what's lef' for you. But they ain't to be no fightin'! I don't know if I'm doin' right or not but--go inside, ever'body stay inside. They ain't enough. All you gonna get is jus' a taste but--I can't help it, I can't keep it from you.
F	MA	I done fine! Now nobody got enough!
M	AGENT	You men want to work?
M	PA	Sure we wanta work. Where's it at?
M	AGENT	Tulare County. Fruit's opening up. Need a lot of pickers.
M	FLOYD	You doin' the hirin'?
M	AGENT	Well, I'm contracting the land.
M	FIRST MAN	Whay you payin?
M	AGENT	Well, can't tell exactly, yet. 'Bout thirty cents, I guess.
M	FIRST MAN	Why can't you tell? You took the contrac', didn' you?
M	AGENT	That's true. But it's keyed to the price. Might be a little more, might be a little less.
M	FLOYD	All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
M	AGENT	You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
M	FLOYD	'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know-- --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
M	AGENT	Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
M	FLOYD	Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry. 'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
M	AGENT	Joe!
M	FLOYD	You see? If this guy was on the level, would he bring a cop along?
M	DEPUTY	What's the trouble?
M	AGENT	Ever see this guy before?
M	DEPUTY	What'd he do?
M	AGENT	He's agitatin'.
M	DEPUTY	Hmmm. Seems like I have. Seems like I seen him hangin' around that used car lot that was busted into. Yep, I'd swear it's the same fella. Get in that car.
M	TOM	You got nothin' on him.
M	DEPUTY	Open your trap again and you'll go too.
M	AGENT	You fellas don't wanta lissen to troublemakers. You better pack up an' come on to Tulare County.
M	DEPUTY	Might be a good idea to do what he says. Too many of you Okies aroun' here already. Folks beginnin' to figger it ain't maybe *safe*. Might start a epidemic or sump'n. Wouldn't like a bunch a guys down here with pick handles tonight, would you?
M	DEPUTY	Now, you.
M	CASY	Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
M	TOM	I ain't gonna run.
M	CASY	He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
M	TOM	You're right!
M	CASY	Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
M	CASY	Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
M	AL	How 'bout you?
M	CASY	*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know. An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
M	AL	But ain't no reason--
M	CASY	Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
M	AL	Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
M	CASY	Sure. Why not?
M	SECOND DEPUTY	What's goin' on here?
M	CASY	This man a yours, he got tough an' I hit him. Then he started shootin'-- hit a woman down the line--so I hit him again.
M	SECOND DEPUTY	Well--what'd you do in the first place?
M	CASY	I talked back.
M	CASY	They's a woman down there like to bleed to death from his bad shootin'.
M	SECOND DEPUTY	Take a look at her. Mike, is this the fella that hit you?
M	DEPUTY	Don't look like him.
M	CASY	It was me, all right. You just got smart with the wrong fella.
M	DEPUTY	Don't look like him, but... maybe it was. I ain't sure.
M	SECOND DEPUTY	Get in that car.
M	MAN	Boy, what a mess a .45 does make! They got a tourniquet on. We'll send a doctor out.
M	DEPUTY	But what you gonna do? Must be *thousands* of 'em around here, sore and hungry and living in them dumps. What you gonna do about 'em?
M	SECOND DEPUTY	You gotta hold 'em down. Hold 'em down or they'll take over the whole country. That's all you *can* do.
M	DEPUTY	Well, they ain't gonna take over *my* country. I been livin' here too long for *that*. Maybe some a the boys better drop around tonight and give 'em something to think about.
M	PA	Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
M	AL	Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
F	MA	You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
M	PA	Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
F	MA	You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
M	PA	Now don't get sassy, Ma.
F	MA	Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away. An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
M	PA	I never *seen* her so sassy. An' she ain't so young, neither!
M	AL	I'd come back--
F	MA	But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
M	PA	Jus' sassy, that's all.
F	MA	Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
M	AL	But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
F	MA	Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us-- --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
M	TOM	Hey, Al!
M	AL	Tom? You can come on. They gone.
M	TOM	We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
M	JOHN	Here I am.
M	PA	What's a matter now?
M	TOM	Fella tells me some a them poolroom boys figgerin' to burn the whole camp out tonight. Got to get that truck loaded--what you doin' with the jack-handle, Ma?
M	MA, PA, AND AL	Al's tryin' to go away... She jus' got sassy... All I aimed to do...
M	TOM	Awright, you can fight it out later. Right now we got to hustle. Where's Connie?
F	MA	Connie's gone. Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
M	PA	Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
F	MA	Pa! Shh!
M	PA	How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
M	TOM	Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck. Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
F	ROSASHARN	Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
M	TOM	Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry.
M	TOM	Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
M	PA	I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
M	TOM	Give 'im a fryin' pan.
F	ROSASHARN	Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
F	MA	Maybe that's jus' what he done.
M	TOM	Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
F	MA	Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
M	TOM	I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
F	MA	You promised, Tommy.
M	TOM	I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
F	MA	You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.

M	PA	It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
M	TOM	Fella tells me they's three hunerd thousan' aroun' here like us, a- scrabblin' for work an' livin' like hogs. Can't figger what it is, but *sump'n's* wrong.

M	TOM	Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
F	MA	You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
M	AL	Know what I'm a-gonna do? I'm a-gonna save up an' go in town an' get me a job in a garage. Live in a room an' eat in restaurants. Go to the movin' pitchers *ever'* night. Cowboy pitchers.
M	AL	What is it, a wreck?
M	COP	Where you think you're going?

M	COP	Want to work, do you?
M	TOM	Sure do.
M	COP	Pull up behind that car. Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
M	TOM	What's the matter? What's happened?
M	COP	Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
M	AL	Maybe the road's out.

F	MA	Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.

M	TOM	Okay. I be back a little later.
F	MA	You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
M	TOM	Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
M	GUARD	Where you think you're going?
M	TOM	Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
M	GUARD	Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
M	TOM	You mean I can't even get outa here?
M	GUARD	Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
M	TOM	I'll walk back.
M	TOM	Evenin'.
M	JOE	Who are you?
M	TOM	Jus' goin' pas', that's all.
M	JOE	Know anybody here?
M	TOM	No. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you.
M	CASY	What's the matter?
M	TOM	Casy! What you doin' here?
M	CASY	Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
M	TOM	Thought you was in jail.
M	CASY	No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in.
M	FRANK	This the fella you been talkin' about?
M	CASY	This is him. What you doin' here, Tommy?
M	TOM	Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
M	FRANK	This here's a strike.
M	TOM	Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
M	FRANK	Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
M	TOM	Sure. We made a buck since midday.
M	CASY	Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids... So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
M	TOM	I dunno. Payin' five now.
M	CASY	I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
M	TOM	I aim to.
M	CASY	Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
M	FRANK	You hear sump'n?
M	TOM	I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
M	CASY	Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
M	TOM	They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
M	CASY	But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
M	FRANK	An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
M	TOM	Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
M	CASY	I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
M	TOM	We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
M	CASY	Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*. I don't. I got to *ask*.
M	JOE	I don't like it.
M	CASY	What's the matter?
M	JOE	Can't tell. Seems like I hear sump'n, an' then I listen an' they ain't nothin' to hear.
M	FRANK	'Tain't outa the question, y'know.
M	CASY	All of us a little itchy. Cops been tellin' us how they gonna beat us up an' run us outa the country. Not them reg'lar deppities, but them tin- star fellas they got for guards. They figger I'm the leader because I talk so much.
M	FRANK	Turn out that light an' come outside. They's sump'n here.
M	CASY	What is it?
M	FRANK	I dunno. Listen.
M	CASY	Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
M	TOM	I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
M	JOE	Down that way--under the bridge span.
M	VOICE	There they are! Stand where you are!
M	DEPUTY	That's him! That one in the middle, the skinny one! Chuck! Alec! Here they are! We got 'em!
M	CASY	Listen, you fellas. You don't know what you're doin'. You're helpin' to stave kids.
M	DEPUTY	Shut up, you red--
M	SECOND DEPUTY	Looks like to me you killed him.
M	DEPUTY	Turn him over. Put the light on him.
M	DEPUTY'S VOICE	Serves him right, too.
M	SECOND DEPUTY	Where's that flash?
M	THIRD DEPUTY	Here.
M	THIRD DEPUTY	Boy, he's *good* and dead! You see that fella that done it?
M	SECOND DEPUTY	I ain't sure--but I caught him one across the face, and believe me, I give him a trade-mark *he* ain't gonna be able to shake off easy!
F	MA	Anybody ask anything?
F	ROSASHARN	No'm.
F	MA	Stand by the door.
F	MA	How's it feel, Tommy?
M	TOM	Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
F	MA	Looks like you done it.
M	TOM	I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
F	MA	Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
M	TOM	They killed Casy first.
F	MA	That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
M	TOM	They know what--this fella looks like?
F	MA	They know he got hit in the face.
M	TOM	I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
F	MA	It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
M	TOM	I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
F	MA	Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn-- --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
M	TOM	Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
F	ROSASHARN	Here come a lot of people.
M	BOOKKEEPER'S VOICE	How many of you?
M	MIGRANT'S VOICE	Ten of us. Whatcha payin'?
M	BOOKKEEPER	House 25. Number's on the door.
F	MIGRANT	Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
M	BOOKKEEPER	Two and a half cents.
F	MIGRANT	Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
M	BOOKKEEPER	Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
F	MIGRANT	But--but how we gonna eat?
M	BOOKKEEPER	Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
F	MIGRANT	Which way is House 25?
M	TOM	That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
F	MA	Comes night we'll get outa here.
F	MA	It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
M	TOM	I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
M	GUARD'S VOICE	What's goin' on here?
M	PA	We're goin' out.
M	GUARD	What for?
F	MA	We got a job offered--good job.
M	GUARD	Yeah? Let's have a look at you. Wasn't there another fella with you?
M	AL	You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
M	GUARD	I guess that's what he looked like.
M	AL	We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
M	GUARD	What'd he look like again?
M	AL	Short fella. Pale face.
M	GUARD	Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
M	AL	I didn't see nothin'.
M	GUARD	Okay. Go on.
M	SECOND GUARD	Goin' out for good?
M	AL	Yeah. Goin' north. Got a job.
M	SECOND GUARD	Okay.
F	MA	You done good, Al. Just good.
M	PA	Know where we're a-goin'?
F	MA	Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
F	ROSASHARN	Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
F	MA	I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
M	TOM	Full up. Uncle John come through with five bucks he been hol'in' out on us since we lef' home.
M	TOM	She's hotter'n a heifer.
M	AL	Fan-belt's shot.
M	TOM	Picks a nice place for it, too, don't she?
M	TOM	Any gas?
M	AL	Gallon or two?
M	TOM	Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
F	ROSASHARN	Tommy. Some smoke up there.
M	TOM	Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
M	AL	She got to make it.
F	MA	What is it?
M	TOM	Don't know--but it's better'n this.
M	CARETAKER	You hit 'er too fast.
M	AL	What's the idea of that?
M	CARETAKER	Well, a lot a kids play in here. You tell folks to go slow and they liable to forget. But let 'em hit that hump once and they don't forget!
M	AL	Got any room here for us?
M	CARETAKER	You're lucky. Fellow just moved out half-hour ago. Down that line and turn to the left. You'll see it. You'll be in No. 4 Sanitary Unit.
F	MA	What's that?
M	CARETAKER	Toilet and showers and washtubs.
F	MA	You mean you got *washtubs?* An' runnin' water?
M	CARETAKER	Yes, ma'am. Camp committee'll call on you in the morning and get you fixed.
M	AL	Cops?
M	CARETAKER	No. No cops. Folks here elect their own cops. The ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am, about the kids and the sanitary unit and who takes care of 'em. Come inside and sign up.
M	TOM	Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
M	PA	We gonna stay, ain't we?
M	TOM	You're tootin' we're gonna stay.
M	CARETAKER	I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
M	TOM	Joad. Tom Joad.
M	CARETAKER	How many of you?
M	AL	How 'bout it, Uncle John? Gotta pitch this tent.
M	JOHN	I'm a-comin'.
F	MA	You don't look so good.
M	JOHN	I *ain't* so good, but--I'm a-comin'.
M	CARETAKER	Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
M	TOM	We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
M	CARETAKER	We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
M	TOM	Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
M	CARETAKER	That's the way it is.
M	TOM	An' you say no cops?
M	CARETAKER	No cop can come in here without a warrant.
M	TOM	I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
M	CARETAKER	They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
M	TOM	You got dances too?
M	CARETAKER	We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
M	TOM	Say, who runs this place?
M	CARETAKER	Government.
M	TOM	Why ain't they more like it?
M	CARETAKER	*You* find out, I can't.
M	TOM	Anything like work aroun' here?
M	CARETAKER	Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
M	TOM	Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
M	CARETAKER	That cut you got?

M	RUTHIE	It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!
M	RUTHIE	Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
M	WINFIELD	Won't they ketch us?
M	RUTHIE'S VOICE	Them's where you wash your han's.
M	WINFIELD'S VOICE	What's these?
M	RUTHIE'S VOICE	Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
M	WINFIELD'S VOICE	Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
M	RUTHIE'S VOICE	I seen 'em b'fore you did.
M	WINFIELD'S VOICE	What's this?
M	RUTHIE'S VOICE	Now don't you go monk'ing--
M	RUTHIE'S VOICE	Now you done it! You busted it!
M	WINFIELD'S VOICE	I never--
M	WINFIELD	Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
M	RUTHIE	Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
M	WINFIELD	I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
M	RUTHIE	Lissen. You done busted it. You hear? But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
M	WINFIELD	Please don't.
M	RUTHIE	I won't-- --if you won't tell what *I* done!
M	TOM	If this don't feel good!
M	WILKIE	Wait'll about 'leven o'clock, see how good she feels then!
M	TOM	Seems like a nice frien'ly fella to work for, too.
M	TIM	Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
M	TOM	Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
M	THOMAS	Lissen here. Maybe I'm talkin' myself outa my farm, but I like you fellas, so I'm gonna tell you. You live in that gov'ment camp, don't you?
M	TOM	Yes, sir.
M	THOMAS	And you have dances every Saturday night?
M	WILKIE	We sure do.
M	THOMAS	Well, look out next Saturday night.
M	TIM	What you mean? I belong to the central committee. I got to know.
M	THOMAS	Don't you ever tell I told.
M	TIM	What is it?
M	THOMAS	Well, the association don't like the government camps. Can't get a deputy in there. Can't arrest a man without a warrant. But if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting--a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp. Like last night. Lissen. "Citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters' camp, warn agitators to get out of the county."
M	TOM	Listen. What *is* these reds? Ever'time you turn aroun' somebody sayin' somebody else's a red. What is these reds, anyway?
M	WILKIE	Well, I tell you. They was a fella up the country named King--got about 30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a winery--an' he's all a time talkin' about reds. Drivin' the country to ruin, he says. Got to git rid of 'em, he says. Well, they was a young fella jus' come out an' he was listenin one day. He kinda scratched his head an' he says, "Mr. King, what *is* these reds you all a time talkin' about?" Well, sir, Mr. King says, "Young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when I'm payin' twenty-five."
M	THOMAS	I ain't talkin' about that one way or the other. All I'm saying is that there's going to be a fight in the camp Saturday night. And there's going to be deputies ready to go in.
M	TOM	But why? Those fellas ain't botherin' nobody.
M	THOMAS	I'll tell you why. Those folks in to being treated like humans. Suppose the Government closes its camps. Suppose too many people pass through 'em. Well, when those people go back to the squatters' camps they'll be hard to handle. Go on back to work now. Maybe I've talked myself into trouble, but you're folks like us, and I like you.
M	TIM	Nobody won't know who tol'. We thank you. An' they ain't gonna be no fight, either.
M	COMMITTEE MAN	Ev'nin', ma'am. Who'd you say invited you?
M	GUESTS	Mister an' Mizz Clark, they ast us.
M	COMMITTEE MAN	Yes, ma'am. Come right in, ma'am.
M	WILKIE	Hidy, Mr. Thomas. Hidy, Mizz Thomas.
M	THOMAS	You watching out, ain't you?
M	WILKIE	Don't you worry. Ain't gonna be no trouble.
M	THOMAS	I hope you know what you're talking about.
F	ROSASHARN	Ma... Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
F	MA	Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
F	ROSASHARN	I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
F	MA	You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
F	ROSASHARN	An' you won't let nobody touch me?
F	MA	No--an' look what I got for you.
F	MA	I used to wear these--when your pa come callin' on me. You'll look pretty in 'em tonight.
M	WILKIE	They tell me you're half Injun. You look all Injun to me.
M	JULE	No, jes' half. Wisht I was full- blooded. Gov'ment'd be lookin' out for me an' I'd be ridin' around in a Buick eight.
M	COMMITTEE MAN	Who give you the invitation?
M	MAN	Fella named Jackson--Buck Jackson.
M	COMMITTEE MAN	Okay. Come on in.
M	JULE	Them's our fellas.
M	WILKIE	How you know?
M	JULE	Jes' got a feelin'. They're kinda scared too. Follow 'em an' get a holt of Jackson. See if he knows 'em. I'll stay here.
M	FIDDLER	Swing your ladies an' a dol ce do. Join han's roun' an' away we go! Swing to the right an' a swing to the lef'. Break, now break--back to back!
F	MA	Thank you kin'ly but she ain't well.
F	MA	Maybe you wouldn't think it, but your pa was as nice a dancer as I ever seen, when he was young. Kinda makes me think a ol' times.
M	JACKSON	I seen 'em before. Worked at Gregorio's with 'em. But I never ast 'em.
M	WILKIE	Awright. Keep your eye on 'em. Jus' keep 'em in sight, that's all.
M	BOY	I seen 'em, Mr. Wallace. A car with six men parked down by the euc'lyptus tree an' one with three men on the main road. They got guns, too. I seen 'em.
M	TIM	Thank you, Willie. You done good. Well, it looks like the fat's in the far this time.
M	FIRST MAN	What them deppities want to hurt the camp for? How come they can't leave us be?
M	SECOND MAN	What we oughta do, we oughta git us some pickhandles an'--
M	TIM	No! That's what they want. No sir. If they can git a fight goin', then they can run in the cops an' say we ain't orderly--
M	WILKIE	They're here. We got 'em spotted.
M	TIM	You sure you got ever'thing ready?
M	TOM	Ain't gonna be no trouble.
M	TIM	You ain't to hurt them fellas.
M	WILKIE	You don't have to worry. We got ever'thing arranged. Maybe nobody'll even see it.
M	TIM	Just don't use no stick nor no knife, no piece a arn. An' if you got to sock 'em, sock 'em where they won't bleed.
M	TOM	Yes, sir.
M	TIM	Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
M	TOM	Ain't gonna get outa han'.
M	FIRST MAN	Mighty sure a themselves, looks like.
M	TIM	All I hope, I hope they don't kill nobody.
M	AL	Gonna dance tonight? I can waltz.
F	GIRL	That's nothin'--anybody can waltz.
M	AL	Not like me!
F	WOMAN	You git right along! This here girl's spoke for. She's gonna be married, an' her man's a-comin' for her.
M	TOM	She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
F	MA	Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
M	TOM	Excuse me, Ma.
M	AL	Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
M	BLONDE GIRL	Don't hold me so tight.
M	AL	Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
M	BLONDE GIRL	You're *ticklin' me!*
M	AL	That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
M	BLONDE GIRL	Now I can't breathe.
M	LEADER	I'll dance with this girl.
M	AL	You an' who else?
M	LEADER	Don't gimme no argament-- --you little--
M	DRIVER	Open up! We hear you got a riot.
M	CARETAKER	Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
M	DRIVER	Deputy sheriffs.
M	CARETAKER	Got a warrant?
M	DRIVER	We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
M	CARETAKER	Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot. Look for yourself. You got no right to arrest anybody without a warrant, you know.
M	FIRST COP	We'll have a warrant--just as soon as we check with headquarters.
F	MA	Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy?
M	TOM	I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if I ought.
M	TOM	Come outside.
M	TOM	They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
F	MA	It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
M	TOM	I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya-- --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But-- --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
F	MA	I could hide you, Tommy.
M	TOM	I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
F	MA	Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
M	TOM	You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
F	MA	He was a good man.
M	TOM	I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
F	MA	Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
M	TOM	They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
F	MA	You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
M	TOM	No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it. But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
F	MA	How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
M	TOM	Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
F	MA	Then what, Tom?
M	TOM	Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
F	MA	I don't understan' it, Tom.
M	TOM	Me neither. It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.
F	MA	Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
M	TOM	Sure. Good-by.
F	MA	Good-by, Tommy.
M	AL, PA, JOHN	Get them buckets on! Somebody tie down the mattress! You little fellas keep outa the way!
M	MAN	What y'all hurryin' so for? Tell me they got twenny days work.
M	PA	Yes, sir, an' we aim to git in all twenny of 'em.
M	AL	Ready, Ma?
F	MA	I'll get Rosasharn.
M	PA	All aboard, ever'body! All aboard for Fresno!
F	MA	Try to be strong, honey. Someday it'll be diff'rent--someday you'll have another one. You're still jus' a little girl, remember.
M	PA	Make her easy, John. Watch her.
F	MA	She'll be awright.
M	AL	Ready, Pa?
M	PA	Let 'er go, Gallagher!
M	CARETAKER	Good luck to you! Good luck, ever'body!
M	THE JOADS	Good-by, Mr. Conway! Much oblige to you for ever'thing!
M	AL	Twenty days work, oh boy!
M	PA	Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
F	MA	Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
M	AL	Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
F	MA	No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
M	AL	Watch me pass that Chevvy.
M	PA	You the one that keeps us goin', Ma. I ain't no good any more, an' I know it. Seems like I spen' all my time these days a-thinkin' how it use'ta be--thinkin' of home--an' I ain't never gonna see it no more.
F	MA	Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
M	AL	Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
M	PA	Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
F	MA	I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people.
