M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	An original script	by Luc Besson Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
M	PROFESSOR	"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."
M	PROFESSOR	"..the black hole like a door is open... Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..." See? The snake, Billy. The Ultimate Evil ... make sure you get the snake!
M	BILLY	And when is this door opening snake act supposed to occur?
M	PROFESSOR	..if this is the five..and this the thousand..
M	PROFESSOR	Every five thousand years..
M	BILLY	So I have some time..
M	PRIEST	I will take it to them my son.
M	PRIEST	Go with God.. be safe from Evil.. As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.
M	PROFESSOR	"..then arrange the elements of life against the Terror just so.."
M	PROFESSOR	"..Water..fire..earth..air..four elements around the fifth.."
M	PROFESSOR	Aziz! Light!
M	PRIEST	Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
M	PROFESSOR	"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Amen..
M	PROFESSOR	Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
M	PRIEST	Only too well... here you must be parched..
M	PROFESSOR	I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..
M	PROFESSOR	Here the Good.. Here the Evil..
M	PROFESSOR	Here..
M	PROFESSOR	A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
M	PRIEST	Then let us toast to your fame! Here Billy..
M	PRIEST	Drink!
M	PROFESSOR	To fame.. salud..
M	PROFESSOR	We cannot toast with water.. Billy ! In my sack.. the Grappa!
M	PROFESSOR	"..this perfect person.. this perfect being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?
M	PROFESSOR	Where is that boy? Billy!
M	PROFESSOR	And this divine Light they talk about.. what is Divine light?
M	PROFESSOR	Aziz light!
M	PROFESSOR	Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen..
M	PROFESSOR	...Uh, yes?
M	PRIEST	Master... He was about to discover everything, but I had the situation under control.
M	PROFESSOR	Who are you? Are you Germans? Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
M	PRIEST	What did I do wrong?
M	KOMMANDER	Servant, you and the thousand guards before you... You have done your work well, but we have to recover the elements. War will soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.
M	PROFESSOR	Unbelievable!!!
M	PRIEST	The Fifth Element...
M	KOMMANDER	Take them and put them in a safe place.
M	PRIEST	Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
M	KOMMANDER	When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
M	PRIEST	Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
M	KOMMANDER	Time is of no importance, only life is important.
M	KOMMANDER	When EVIL returns so shall we.
M	PRIEST	We will be ready, Lord.
M	BILLY	Stop.
M	PRIEST	No!!! Don't!!!
M	CLERK	Hurry, Kommander! The wall's closing!!!
M	KOMMANDER	A mission is a mission, Savoia. You'll learn that. armor is too bulky, the opening too small. He manages to get his arm and
M	KOMMANDER	My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..
M	STAEDERT	Don't you have anything? Not even a temperature?
M	CAPTAIN	The thermo-analyzers have jammed. One of them reads over a million degrees, the other's at minus 5000... Never seen anything like it.
M	TECHNICIAN	It's taking shape.
M	CAPTAIN	What the hell can it be?
M	TECHNICIAN	Hook-up with the president in one minute, General.
M	STAEDERT	...Send out a probe.
F	AIDE	On air in 30 seconds.
M	CAPTAIN	President on line sir.. Staedert, do you read me?
M	STAEDERT	I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you . His face fills the screen.
M	PRESIDENT	Is that better?
M	STAEDERT	Perfect, Mr. President.
M	PRESIDENT	I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
M	STAEDERT	There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
M	PRESIDENT	What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
M	STAEDERT	Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
M	PRESIDENT	Options.
M	STAEDERT	Wait or act.
M	PRESIDENT	Recommendations.
M	STAEDERT	My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
M	PRESIDENT	Gentlemen?
M	HEAD CHEMISTS	I think it would be foolish to shoot at an organism that seems alive, without first taking the time to study it more! Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.
M	PRESIDENT	No... it's just getting bigger.
M	HEAD CHEMISTS	So do people, but that's no reason to shoot them.
M	PRESIDENT	The security of the Federated Territories is and remains number one priority. I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is acceptable to you?
M	PRESIDENT	All right, then! Staedert? Mr. President?
M	PRESIDENT	...Yes? Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.
M	PRIEST	Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish. I have a different theory to offer you, Mr. President.
M	PRESIDENT	I'm listening.
M	CORNELIUS	Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
M	PRESIDENT	One more reason to shoot first eh?
M	CORNELIUS	Evil begets evil, Mr. President. Shooting would only make it stronger.
M	TECHNICIAN	The probe will attain its objective in five seconds.
M	STAEDERT	Mr. President, we're at crisis point.
M	PRESIDENT	Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
M	CORNELIUS	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
M	PRESIDENT	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
M	STAEDERT	..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile. Marker lights on the objective.
M	SCIENTIST	Its structure has just solidified on the surface, as if the object felt something. If that's the case, we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.
M	CORNELIUS	The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr. President.
M	CAPTAIN	...The ship is in combat formation. The missile is loaded, General.
M	PRESIDENT	Staedert? Give me a minute... I have a doubt.
M	STAEDERT	I don't, Mr. President.
M	STAEDERT	Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum shield protection.
M	CAPTAIN	Yes, Sir.
M	PRESIDENT	Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
M	STAEDERT	I'm about to, Mr. President.
M	SCIENTIST	The planet's diameter has greatly increased and it's moving toward the ship.
M	PRESIDENT	Staedert? Get out of there immediately! I don't want an incident, do you hear me, Staedert?
M	STAEDERT	...What do we have that's bigger than 240?
M	CAPTAIN	Nothing, General.
M	PRESIDENT	Staedert, get out of there! That's an order!
M	STAEDERT	... Good God!
M	KORBEN	I'm coming.
M	KORBEN	Yeah? Hey bud! Finger here. Hi sweetie!
M	FINGER (V.O.)	I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
M	KORBEN	I was talking to the cat.
M	FINGER (V.O.)	Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
M	KORBEN	At least, the cat comes back.
M	FINGER (V.O.)	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
M	KORBEN	I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
M	FINGER (V.O.)	Don't exist bud.
M	KORBEN	I just found a picture of you. How do I look?
M	KORBEN	Like shit. On the packet is an ad: WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.
M	FINGER (V.O.)	Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring me your hack for the 6 month overhaul. A.S.A.P.
M	KORBEN	I don't need one.
M	FINGER (V.O.)	You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
M	KORBEN	Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
M	FINGER (V.O.)	How many points you got left on your license?
M	KORBEN	Uh... at least fifty. In your dreams! See you tonight!
M	KORBEN	Cheers! point.
M	CORNELIUS	We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
M	PRESIDENT	And then? And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
M	PRESIDENT	Is there anything that can stop it?
M	CORNELIUS	Yes..thank God..
M	CORNELIUS	The Mondoshawans don't belong to the Federated Territories, but they are peaceful... in their possession are the four elements of life. These elements when they are gathered around a fifth: The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect life......
M	CORNELIUS	..will produce what the ancients called the light of creation, the light of total goodness which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.
M	PRESIDENT	But what happens if instead of who stands here?
M	CORNELIUS	White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
M	CAPTAIN	Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory.
M	PRESIDENT	I guess I should make a decision..
M	CORNELIUS	They are the only ones who can help..
M	GENERAL	Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the federation. We do not know their intention.. I must recommend a full trinuclear assault..
M	PRESIDENT	Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop? You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
M	CORNELIUS	Thank you, Mr. President.
M	FIRST OFFICER	Two non-identified ships approaching.
M	CAPTAIN	Must be the welcoming committee.
M	CAPTAIN	We've been hit! General alert!!!
M	CAPTAIN	We're losing control! We have to land fast!
M	CAPTAIN	Send out a distress signal!!! Activate the emergency landing procedure!
M	FIRST OFFICER	Impact in less than ten seconds!
M	CAPTAIN	Time is of no importance...
M	KORBEN	Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your mind. Bye sweetie..
M	MUGGER	The cash man!
M	KORBEN	Been here long?
M	MUGGER	Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
M	KORBEN	Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
M	MUGGER	Uh..
M	KORBEN	You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
M	MUGGER	It's not?
M	KORBEN	You gotta push the little yellow button...
M	MUGGER	Thanks..
M	KORBEN	You're welcome..
M	KORBEN	..you know these things are VERY illegal.. you could get in a shit load of trouble.. I better hang onto it for you..
M	VOICE	Please enter your license..
M	VOICE	Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
M	KORBEN	How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't.
M	VOICE	Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
M	KORBEN	I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
M	VOICE	You have nine points left on your license..
M	KORBEN	Thanks for reminding me..
M	VOICE	Have a nice day..
M	KORBEN	Right..
M	CORNELIUS	We are lost!
M	GENERAL MUNRO	Mr. President, the attack was launched by two unregistered warships.
M	PRESIDENT	Close all borders and declare a state of general alert.
M	GENERAL MUNRO	Yes, sir.
M	PRESIDENT	Try to contact these Mondoshawans. We owe them an explanation.
M	CORNELIUS	What are we going to do?
M	PRESIDENT	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
M	PRESIDENT	I promise to keep you informed.
M	PRESIDENT	...Has the rescue team found any survivors?
M	MUNRO	This is all that survived?
M	MACTILBURGH	Actually only one cell survived..
M	MUNRO	Have you identified it?
M	MACTILBURGH	It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
M	MUNRO	Talk English Doc.
M	MACTILBURGH	This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
M	MUNRO	Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
M	MACTILBURGH	Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
M	MACTILBURGH	The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
M	MUNRO	Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
M	MACTILBURGH	We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect. self-destruct box.
M	MUNRO	OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite... otherwise I turn him into cat food.
M	DOCTOR	Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.
M	MACTILBURGH	...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
M	MUNRO	Wonderful!
M	ASSISTANT	... End of reconstruction, beginning of reanimation .
M	MACTILBURGH	Activate life support system.
M	ASSISTANT	Life support system activated.
M	MACTILBURGH	Remove the shield.
M	MACTILBURGH	I told you ... perfect!
M	MUNRO	...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the before she wakes up.
M	GIRL	Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla. Tokemata tokemata! Seno santonoi-aypa! Minoi ay Cheba! Givomana seno!
M	MUNRO	What's she saying?
M	MACTILBURGH	Activate the phonic detector.
M	MACTILBURGH	And give her a light sedative... and something to wear!
M	MUNRO	This thing solid?
M	MACTILBURGH	An elephant couldn't crack it.
M	GIRL	Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!
M	MUNRO	You're gonna have to learn to communicate better than that angel if you want out.
M	CHIEF	Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you go through the main ventilation!
M	CHIEF	Go on follow her!
M	COP	...No way.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	This in the police. Your status is illegal. Please put up your hands and follow our instructions!
M	COP	Christ! She dove off! She lands on the roof of a flying cab.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You have just had an accident. Seven points have been temporarily removed...
M	VOICE / KORBEN	You have one point left on your license. Have a good day.
M	GIRL	Akina delutan, nou-shan.
M	KORBEN	...'Scuse me?
M	COP	You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle. We are going to arrest her. Please leave your hands on the wheel. Thank you for your cooperation.
M	KORBEN	Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left on my license and I gotta get to the garage! Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
M	GIRL	Please... HELP...
M	KORBEN	Don't put me in this position... I can't... I'm late as it is...
M	KORBEN	Finger's gonna kill me.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Your license has been revoked. Would you please....
M	KORBEN	I hate when people cry... I got no defense...
M	GIRL	Daya deo dono Dato. Dalutan!
M	KORBEN	It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
M	COP	Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!
M	KORBEN	We'll wait till things quiet down a bit. You mind?
M	GIRL	...Priest...
M	KORBEN	You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
M	GIRL	Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
M	KORBEN	Vito Cornelius?
M	KORBEN	Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
M	CORNELIUS	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
M	KORBEN	She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
M	CORNELIUS	That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
M	KORBEN	She dropped in on me... holding this.
M	CORNELIUS	The fifth element.
M	KORBEN	Finger's gonna kill me...
M	CORNELIUS	Who are you?
M	KORBEN	I brought the girl remember?
M	CORNELIUS	The girl?
M	KORBEN	Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre language...
M	CORNELIUS	He's a she!
M	KORBEN	You noticed...
M	CORNELIUS	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
M	KORBEN	So you do know her.
M	CORNELIUS	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
M	KORBEN	Perfect...
M	CORNELIUS	It's a miracle!!!
M	DAVID	What is?
M	CORNELIUS	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
M	GIRL	Eto Akta Gamat!
M	KORBEN	I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
M	KORBEN	You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't have kissed you... especially since we haven't been introduced and... Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is Korben, Korben Dallas. Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll need a cab one day. I'll be happy to open the door this time!.
M	DAVID	Father, will you please explain what's going on?
M	CORNELIUS	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
M	KORBEN	...What's your name?
M	GIRL	Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
M	KORBEN	Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
M	GIRL	...Leeloo.
M	KORBEN	That's... really cute...
M	CORNELIUS	Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
F	LEELOO	Corn-i-Lius?
M	CORNELIUS	At your service.
M	DAVID	Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
M	CORNELIUS	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
M	KORBEN	They all like this in your family, father?
M	CORNELIUS	She's an exception..
M	CORNELIUS	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
M	KORBEN	Dallas. Korben Dallas.
M	CORNELIUS	Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
M	KORBEN	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
M	CORNELIUS	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
M	KORBEN	I know. I was there when she arrived.
M	KORBEN	Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
M	CORNELIUS	It means, "Never without my permission".
M	KORBEN	That's what I thought.
M	KORBEN	...Thanks.
M	KORBEN	Evening...
M	NEIGHBOR	Fuck you!
M	KORBEN	...Thanks... You, too.
M	KORBEN	Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry! How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize? How does that sound, huh?
M	KORBEN	Hello? Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
M	KORBEN	Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist.. So, just how big was this fare?
M	KORBEN	5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
M	FINGER (V.O.)	Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
M	KORBEN	Leeloo..
M	DAVID	What's she doing?
M	CORNELIUS	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
M	CORNELIUS	What're you laughing about?
F	LEELOO	Napoleon... small.
M	DAVID	Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
M	CORNELIUS	Yes. Of course..
M	CORNELIUS	Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..
M	CORNELIUS	The case..with the stones... Where is it?
F	LEELOO	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
M	CORNELIUS	The case was stolen?
M	CORNELIUS	Who in gods name would do such a thing?
M	RIGHT ARM	Excuse me sir, the council is worried about the economy heating up. They wondered if it would be possible to fire 500...
F	ZORG	But... 500 is all they need, sir. This is not a man to cross, or contradict.
M	RIGHT ARM	1000! Fine, sir! Sorry to have disturbed you.
M	CORNELIUS	There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
M	DAVID	I didn't know your size.
M	DAVID	They really made her...
M	CORNELIUS	Perfect.
F	LEELOO	Domo danko!
M	CORNELIUS	Leeloo? The Stones... We must get them back.
F	LEELOO	Ikset-kiba. Me imanetaba oum dalat!
M	CORNELIUS	You know exactly where they are!
F	ZORG	Aknot? Is that you?
F	ZORG	...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all! Take it off...
F	ZORG	That's better! Never be ashamed of who you are... You're warriors... be proud...
F	ZORG	So what if the Federal Army crushed your entire race and scattered your people to the wind... Your time for revenge is at hand... Voila... the ZF1.
F	ZORG	...It's light... the handle's adjustable for easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.
F	ZORG	... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. With the replay button, another Zorg innovation, it's even easier... one shot.
F	ZORG	... and replay sends every following shot to the same location...
F	ZORG	I recharge, but the enemy has launched a cowardly sneak attack from behind, the automirror takes care of that. Gives me the time to turn around and finish the job. 300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...
F	ZORG	...Rocket launcher. The always efficient flame thrower... My favorite. Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very practical. And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube system!
F	ZORG	...Four full crates, delivered right on time! What about you, my dear Aknot, did you bring me what I asked you for?
F	ZORG	...Magnificent.
M	CORNELIUS	What do you mean empty?
F	ZORG	Alright..I've got an open mind here.. anyone care to explain?
M	CORNELIUS	She says that the Guardians never really had much faith in humans. They were afraid of being attacked. The stones were given to someone they could trust who took another route. She's supposed to contact this person in a little less than twelve hours from now in a hotel. She's looking for the address!
F	LEELOO	Dot!
M	DAVID	Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation
M	CORNELIUS	...We're saved!
F	ZORG	I'm fucked!
M	AKNOT	You asked for a case. We brought you a case.
F	ZORG	A case with four stones in it. Not one! Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!! What the fuck am I supposed to do with an EMPTY case?!!
M	AKNOT	...We are warriors, not merchants!
F	ZORG	But you can still count. Look... my fingers.
F	ZORG	...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones... ZERO CRATES!!! Put everything back, we're outta here.
M	AKNOT	We risked our lives. I believe a little compensation is in order.
F	ZORG	So, you are a merchant, after all. Leave them one crate. For the cause!
F	ZORG	I don't like warriors! They're too narrow-minded, no sublety. Worse, they fight for hopeless causes..for honor! Honor has killed millions of people but hasn't saved a single one. You know what -- do I like though, I like killer. A real dyed in the wool killer. Cold-blooded. Clean. Methodical. Thorough. A killer, when he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately asked about the little red button on the bottom of the gun.
F	ZORG	Bring the priest.
M	KORBEN	So you forgive me?
M	THAI	Not going to open?
M	KORBEN	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
M	THAI	How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
M	KORBEN	The last two messages I got? The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
M	THAI	You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
M	THAI	...You're fired. Oh!
M	KORBEN	At least I won lunch.
M	THAI	Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
M	DAVID	I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
M	CORNELIUS	Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there.
M	CORNELIUS	I'll get it. Finish your work my son.
M	RIGHT ARM	Father Cornelius?
M	CORNELIUS	My son?
M	RIGHT ARM	Mr. Zorg would like a word with you.
M	CORNELIUS	Mr. Who?
F	ZORG	Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
M	CORNELIUS	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
F	ZORG	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
M	CORNELIUS	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
F	ZORG	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
M	CORNELIUS	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
F	ZORG	Why? What's wrong with me?
M	CORNELIUS	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
F	ZORG	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
F	ZORG	...would you like a drink?
M	CORNELIUS	No thank you.
F	ZORG	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
F	ZORG	Here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is...
F	ZORG	Destroyed...
F	ZORG	...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life!
M	CORNELIUS	They are robots!
F	ZORG	Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. I gave work to at least fifty people today. The engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong. Children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life!
F	ZORG	Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
M	CORNELIUS	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
F	ZORG	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
M	CORNELIUS	Where's the robot to pat your back?
M	CORNELIUS	Can I give you a hand?
F	ZORG	You saved my life... So, I'm going to spare yours. Throw him out!
M	CORNELIUS	You are a monster, Zorg!
F	ZORG	I know...
F	ZORG	...Torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but I want those Stones. You have an hour.
M	CAPTAIN	It's gobbling up all the communication satellites in the galaxy!
M	PRESIDENT	Why the hell is it eating up all those satellites like that?
M	HEAD SCIENTIST	...We're working on it, Mr. President. We're working on it.
M	PRESIDENT	It should only choke on them.
M	MUNRO	I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
M	PRESIDENT	And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
M	MUNRO	The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
M	PRESIDENT	...What do you mean?
M	MUNRO	The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race..they felt we're too unpredictable.. so they gave up the Stones to somebody they do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She's a Diva and she's going to sing at the charity ball on Fhloston Paradise in a few hours. She has the Stones with her.
M	PRESIDENT	Excellent!
M	PRESIDENT	I want your best man on this!
M	MUNRO	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
M	THAI	Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..
M	KORBEN	Saved by the bell.
M	KORBEN	...Hello?
M	MOTHER (V.O.)	You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
M	KORBEN	Hi Ma... I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes. Korben strikes one and it fizzles. You wouldn't even eat one to help your poor mother, and you win the big prize? Know something? The whole thing makes me sick! Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
M	KORBEN	Yes ma..
M	KORBEN	Go on... This is gonna take a while!
M	KORBEN	Other than that... You all right?
M	MOTHER (V.O.)	...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
M	KORBEN	I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
M	KORBEN	All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
M	MOTHER (V.O.)	You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
M	KORBEN	Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
M	MOTHER (V.O.)	They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
M	KORBEN	Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back. MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
M	MUNRO	Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
M	KORBEN	What mission?
M	MUNRO	To save the world.
M	KORBEN	Where have I heard this song before?
M	MUNRO	You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
M	KORBEN	Just one... why me?
M	MUNRO	Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
M	MUNRO	Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
M	KORBEN	And the third one?
M	MUNRO	You're the only one left alive...
M	MUNRO	Don't you open your messages?
M	KORBEN	I've had enough good news for today
M	MUNRO	You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
M	KORBEN	You rigged the contest?
M	MUNRO	Major Iceborg will accompany you... as your wife...
M	KORBEN	You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
M	MUNRO	Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
M	KORBEN	I'm not going.
M	MUNRO	Why not?
M	KORBEN	One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
M	KORBEN	...Scuse me.
M	KORBEN	...Shit!
M	MUNRO	What is it?
M	KORBEN	It's my wife.
M	MUNRO	I thought you were divorced.
M	KORBEN	I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished. She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
M	KORBEN	...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
M	MUNRO	Three of us will never fit in there!
M	KORBEN	Oh, yes you will...
M	KORBEN	...Coming! shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between eyes held by Cornelius.
F	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
M	KORBEN	I suppose that means "Hi" ?
M	CORNELIUS	I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
M	KORBEN	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
M	CORNELIUS	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
M	KORBEN	What kind of mission?
M	CORNELIUS	We have to save the world.
M	KORBEN	Good luck..
M	CORNELIUS	Of course.
M	KORBEN	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
M	KORBEN	I'm sorry..
M	VOICE	This is a police control action..
M	VOICE	This is not an exercise. This is a police control.
M	CORNELIUS	Oh my god oh my god..
M	KORBEN	Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!
M	CORNELIUS	What are you doing?
M	KORBEN	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
M	VOICE	...Spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles, please.
M	COP 1	Put your hands in the yellow circles, please. a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair Sir? Are you a human?
M	KORBEN	No, I'm a meat popsicle.
M	COP 3	I found him!
M	COP 1	Sir, this is a control. Please put your hands in the yellow circles.
M	NEIGHBOR	Fuck you!!
M	KORBEN	Wrong answer.
M	COP	OK, we got the guy under wraps.
M	COP (O.S.)	It was not easy, but we bagged him!. Thanks for the tip!
M	RIGHT ARM	Glad to help.
M	RIGHT ARM	They just arrested the guy for Uranium smuggling. Everything's going as planned.
M	RIGHT ARM	All I have to do now is to go to the airport and take his place. I should be in Fhloston in less than four hours.
F	ZORG	Don't come back without the Stones.
M	KORBEN	I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.
M	KORBEN	Here let me wrap you up.
M	KORBEN	..It's funny. I've met you twice today and you've ended up in my arms both times.
F	LEELOO	Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
M	KORBEN	Uh..you're welcome.
M	KORBEN	Coffee! That's what you need! A nice, hot cup of coffee!
M	KORBEN	With some honey! You'll see, honey's great!...
M	KORBEN	A hot cup of coffee... with honey...
M	KORBEN	I've got this great honey somewhere. You know about honey? There used to be these little animals who made it with antenna...
M	KORBEN	..and these other animals who ate it.. one were bees the other were bears..
M	KORBEN	I forget which ate it and which made it but..
M	KORBEN	Here it is!
M	KORBEN	Taste this...
M	KORBEN	It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?
M	KORBEN	You hear that?
F	LEELOO	Cornelius..
M	KORBEN	Oh god!
M	KORBEN	I'm really sorry.. let me help you..
F	LEELOO	Achta ge lumitai de matala..
M	KORBEN	What?
F	LEELOO	Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
M	CORNELIUS	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
M	AKANIT	Korben Dallas! We got him.
M	AKNOT	Perfect... Take command, Akanit. Go to Fhloston and get the Stones... If Zorg really wants them... He'll have to negotiate. Revenge is at hand.
M	KORBEN	Jesus!... Some priest!
M	KORBEN	Yeah? Have you pulled yourself together?
M	KORBEN	...Not yet.
M	KORBEN	I'll take the mission. A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Illegal gathering in Zone 4.
M	CORNELIUS	Leeloo, be careful.
M	CORNELIUS	Did you get them?
M	CORNELIUS	Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.
M	CORNELIUS	And Korben David Dallas.
F	LEELOO	Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
M	CORNELIUS	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
M	CORNELIUS	He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva... get the Stones... See you at the temple... God be with you.
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	Congratulations on winning the contest.
M	KORBEN	Hey! I really thought I was going to miss my flight! Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on the conveyor belt?
M	DAVID	Uh... yeah.
M	KORBEN	Great! Now beat it!
M	KORBEN	Excuse me. I was so afraid I'd miss the flight that I sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card.
M	KORBEN	...My cousin David...
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	Your wife?
M	KORBEN	Uh, yes... Newlyweds. You know how it is... Love at first sight. You meet, something goes tilt,. you get married, you hardly know each other. Right, darling?
F	LEELOO	Dinoine chagantakat!
M	KORBEN	Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
M	COP	
M	CORNELIUS	I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work. I know she was made to be strong but she's also so fragile... So human. You know what I mean?
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	Dallas... Korben...
M	NEIGHBOR	Yes, that's me.
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	Just a minute, please.
M	NEIGHBOR	We'll be right back ... we're gonna check out the duty free...
M	ROBOT	The same?
M	CORNELIUS	Yeah... Make that two...
M	CORNELIUS	Where's Leeloo?
M	DAVID	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
M	CORNELIUS	It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
M	CORNELIUS	Here's the key to the Temple.. Prepare for our arrival! A police patrol is coming. This time, it seems to be for them.
M	NEIGHBOR	Tell Aknot plan A flopped. Tell him to go to plan B.
M	COP	...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!
M	STEWARDESS	You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the coolest DJ in the universe.
M	KORBEN	Listen... I don't want to be interviewed. I'd prefer to remain anonymous.
M	STEWARDESS	Forget anonymous. You'll be doing Loc Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!
M	KORBEN	You gotta be kidding!
M	LOC RHOD	Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated man in the universe. The one and only winner of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy is perfect.. ...The right size, right build, right hair. Right on! Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out there D-man!
M	KORBEN	...Hi.
M	LOC RHOD	Does it get any better or what!
M	LOC RHOD	...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates. And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
M	KORBEN	Uh... not really.
M	LOC RHOD	Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause Korben is on the case with a major face...
M	LOC RHOD	...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your every desire.
M	LOC RHOD	Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and one follies, home of luxury and beauty. A magic fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and Bootchie Koochie Koo...
M	LOC RHOD	Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on the prowl. Owwww!
M	LOC RHOD	...And start licking your stamps little girls, this guy's gonna have you writing home to Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail of the sexiest man of the year... D-man... Your man... My man.
M	VOCODER (O.S.)	End of transmission.
M	LOC RHOD	Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow, when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make believe you have more than a one word vocabulary. OK pal? Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.
M	KORBEN	I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
M	LOC RHOD	Crystal.
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?
M	RIGHT ARM	That's right.
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on my list... and he's already checked in.
M	RIGHT ARM	That's impossible! He's in j... I mean, there must be some mistake. I have my ticket! I'm the real Korben Dallas!
M	CHECK-IN ATTENDANT	I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished. Right Arm totally loses it.
M	RIGHT ARM	I want to see your boss! Get rid of this fucking window! Somebody's made a mistake, goddamnit!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	This is not an exercise. This is a police control. Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...
M	RIGHT ARM	Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited... that's all... I'm calm now.
F	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
M	KORBEN	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
M	KORBEN	Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets... they're not mine... I mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks... I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble... I'd love to be on vacation with you... but now.... now I've got to work... And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.
F	LEELOO	Love...
M	KORBEN	Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
F	LEELOO	Peace... and love...
M	KORBEN	Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
F	LEELOO	What is... Make Love?
M	KORBEN	Know what? On that subject maybe you'd be better off asking the screen.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	...to make your flight as short and agreeable as possible, our flight attendants are switching on the timing sleeper which will regulate your sleep during the trip...
F	LEELOO	OK! Finished!
M	KORBEN	Finished what?
F	LEELOO	Learning language.
M	KORBEN	Which one?
F	LEELOO	All 900.
M	KORBEN	You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
F	LEELOO	Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
M	KORBEN	I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
F	LEELOO	Apipoussan!
M	KORBEN	Apipoussan?
F	LEELOO	Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
M	KORBEN	Uh...
F	LEELOO	...Hoppi-hoppa.
M	KORBEN	Help...
M	STEWARDESS	Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!
M	STEWARDESS 2	Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume your individual position.
M	LOC RHOD	I don't want an individual position, I want all positions!
M	STEWARDESS 2	We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!
M	LOC RHOD	Now you're talking!
M	COPILOT	Molecular axis authorization. Vector 130. Destination Fhloston. Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.
M	PILOT	Thanks, Miss.
M	MECHANIC	Tell the ground crew we've got parasites in the landing gear.
M	GROUND CREW MEMBER	Disinfecting!
M	RIGHT ARM	Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.
F	ZORG	I'm listening.
M	RIGHT ARM	The real Korben Dallas is on the plane! He took my place.
F	ZORG	This is a joke, right?
M	LOC RHOD	No!! I swear to God! I've never been this sincere with a human before!
M	GROUND CREW MEMBER	You're fueled and ready to go. Have a nice flight.
M	PILOT	Everything ready for liftoff?
M	STEWARDESS	No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...
F	ZORG	I cannot hear you. We have a bad connection here. What's your number?
M	RIGHT ARM	
F	ZORG	I'll call you back.
M	COPILOT	Anti static pressure?
M	MECHANIC	Primed.
F	ZORG	
M	COPILOT	10 seconds...
M	PILOT	Power increase.
F	ZORG	
M	PILOT	Liftoff.
M	COPILOT	Landing gear secure. Let's light one up.
M	TECHNICIAN	All right! We're finally getting something!
M	HEAD SCIENTIST	The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!
M	PRESIDENT	What the hell does it want with radio waves?
M	HEAD SCIENTIST	...Probably wants to make a call!
M	SECRETARY (O.S.)	Mr. Shadow on the line.
F	ZORG	Yes... Zorg here.
M	SHADOW	Am I disturbing you?
F	ZORG	No... not at all. Where are you?
M	SHADOW	...Not far, now.
F	ZORG	Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
M	SHADOW	Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
F	ZORG	Got it.
M	SHADOW	How's our deal coming along?
F	ZORG	Fine, just fine! I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now. But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
M	SHADOW	Money is of no importance... I want the Stones!
F	ZORG	The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
M	SHADOW	...I can't wait to be among you.
M	STEWARDESS	Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent toward Fhloston Paradise...
M	STEWARDESS	I wanted to tell you that...
M	PILOT	Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.
M	PILOT	Docking activated. You can let the passengers out.
M	KORBEN	Pardon me. Excuse me. I'm trying to reach my wife.. Sorry!
M	HOSTESS	Welcome to Paradise.
M	HOST	If you don't have the code you can't open it!
M	LOC RHOD	My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
M	KORBEN	I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
M	LOC RHOD	Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
M	KORBEN	I don't think this is a good time...
M	LOC RHOD	...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
M	KORBEN	Yeah, very big, a giant.
M	LOC RHOD	I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
M	KORBEN	For the concert it says formal attire... I didn't bring...
M	HOSTESS	Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after the concert to open it.
M	KORBEN	Hello? You little sleaze bag!
M	KORBEN	...Ma??? Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
M	KORBEN	...Ma!!!
M	FOG	The Diva's ship is coming in.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	I want maximum security.
M	FOG	Yes. Sir!
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	OK, let's hear it.
M	CORNELIUS	Where was I?
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	...You open the door. There's a cabby with a girl in his arms.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	What happened? A bomb go off in your face?
M	BEAT-UP COP	Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb... with green eyes.
M	CORNELIUS	And the smile of an angel?
M	CORNELIUS	May I speak to you alone.
M	DIVA'S ASSISTANT	Please forgive this little incident. She wants you to know that she senses great powers in you... in the service of a noble cause... She will give you what you have come to get, but she wants to sing first... One last time...
M	DIVA'S ASSISTANT	Miss.
M	FOG	Hello, I'm head of security. Everything is in order. You can...
M	FOG	...make yourselves at home safely. If you need anything...give it a knock!
M	KORBEN	Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days vacation and I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend them on the phone.
M	KORBEN	...Hang on, it's the door. No! I told you I didn't bring anybody! I'm all alone... as usual!
M	KORBEN	...I'll call you back.
M	KORBEN	Here we go again...
F	LEELOO	You know women normally change five times more than men.
M	KORBEN	You get that off the screen?
F	LEELOO	Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
M	KORBEN	You noticed..
F	LEELOO	OK, you can turn around!
M	KORBEN	Where you going?
F	LEELOO	I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
M	KORBEN	No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
F	LEELOO	Do you know how this works?
M	KORBEN	I have an idea. Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.
M	KORBEN	I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
F	LEELOO	And you can't concentrate with me around?.
M	KORBEN	It's difficult.
M	KORBEN	Army issue. I'm sorry.
F	LEELOO	You're nothing but a... a...
M	KORBEN	The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
M	LOC RHOD	Hey Stud we gotta...
M	LOC RHOD	Korben my man what's happening here? Who's the chick? What's the gig? We free forming here? Getting funky with the monkey? Can I get in on this?
M	KORBEN	No..to all of the above.
M	LOC RHOD	We have just walked into what is probably the most beautiful concert hall in the universe. Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he must have busted his balls! I see a row of former ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets. He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's stone-deaf!
M	BABY RAY	...to who?
M	LOC RHOD	...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king of laserball and the best paid player in the League. ...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar. "I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she recently confessed to me. She will no doubt prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.
M	AKANIT	It's showtime!
M	MANAGER	Yeah!? Flowers for the Diva.
M	MANAGER	She's allergic to flowers!!!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	There's champagne as well...
M	CORNELIUS	...My God!
M	CAPTAIN	Commander, I have a ship with a main malfunction. He requests permission to dock for repairs.
M	COMMANDER	Did you check out his registration number?
M	CAPTAIN	Everything's in order.
M	COMMANDER	Put him in the docking garage and inform the police. Permission granted. Dock 575. You have an hour. Will that be enough time'?
F	ZORG	More than enough.
M	CORNELIUS	Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped. We must stop them!. I'm going to free you but you must promise to help me!
M	MANGALORE	I have it.
F	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
M	MANGALORE	They were waiting for us! It was an ambush!
M	AKANIT	If it's war they want it's war they'll get! Enact the Final Plan!
F	ZORG	My compliments, little lady! ...And thanks for doing all the dirty work! I couldn't have done it any better myself! ...Now hand over the Stones!
F	ZORG	Nice knowing you.
F	ZORG	You can run but you can't hide...
M	AKANIT	Nobody move! We're taking over this ship!
M	CORNELIUS	I told you...
M	MANGALORE 1	Everyone down!
M	LOC RHOD	Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being... attacked. The place is crawling with warriors.
F	ZORG	You want something done, do it yourself!
M	LOC RHOD	They're hideous. They've got a crest on the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers all over their hands. Totally hideous!
M	MUNRO	...Mangalores!
M	PRESIDENT	Send a battalion out immediately!
M	KORBEN	I was sent by the government to help you.
F	DIVA	Don't worry. This is my fate... How was the concert?
M	KORBEN	I've never heard anything so beautiful in my life.
F	DIVA	You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
M	KORBEN	Who?
F	DIVA	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
M	KORBEN	Leeloo... is... she's...
F	DIVA	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
M	KORBEN	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
M	CORNELIUS	Of course I was telling you the truth!... If you had listened to me in the first place, we wouldn't be in this predicament now!
F	DIVA	She needs you. She needs your help and your love. She's more fragile than she seems...
M	KORBEN	...Yeah, so am I.
F	DIVA	She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
M	KORBEN	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
F	DIVA	Do you love her?
M	KORBEN	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
F	DIVA	I don't have time... I need to know.
M	KORBEN	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
F	DIVA	I would like to have died in peace...
M	KORBEN	You tell me to save the world then you go off and leave me in the shit!
M	KORBEN	Come on! You're not gonna die in peace! You're not going to die at all! You hear me? Where are the Stones?
M	KORBEN	I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
F	DIVA	They are... with me...
M	MANGALORE 2	Stay calm and nobody will get hurt! Hands on your head and into the hall!
M	KORBEN	...The Stones are with me?
M	KORBEN	...In me?
M	LOC RHOD	Don't you think we'd better be going?
M	MANGALORE	Hey, you! With the others!
M	KORBEN	That's it... I've had... all day people have been sticking guns in my face...
M	LOC RHOD	Korben man... These dudes are going to waste us if we don't do what they say.
M	KORBEN	You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
M	LOC RHOD	Got it... walkie-talkie.
M	AKANIT	What's the situation in the hall?
M	MUGGER	There's no more resistance. Everything's under control.
M	KORBEN	Everybody down! Laser bullets stinging all around his head.
M	LOC RHOD	This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas, the winner of the Gemini Croquette contest just killed three warriors like he was swatting flies... He dives for cover behind the bar.
M	LOC RHOD	It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center forward joining in the battle...
M	PRINCESS AACHEN	All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?
M	LOC RHOD	GET OFF MY BACK!
M	KORBEN	Toss me the balls!
M	BABY RAY	What?
M	KORBEN	The balls for Christ's sake!
M	EMPEROR JAPHET	He wants the balls! You deaf or something?
M	KORBEN	How far is he from here?
M	EMPEROR	I'd say about thirty yards to the left.
M	LOC RHOD	...And our man Korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch.
M	FOG	Thanks for your help.
M	KORBEN	Forget it.
M	KORBEN	Leeloo???
F	LEELOO	Kor... ban...
M	COP 1	Hey, who are you?
M	KORBEN	The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.
M	KORBEN	Seven to the left. Five to the right.
M	COP	What's he doing?
M	KORBEN	Six to the left. One to the right.
M	LOC RHOD	He's on vacation.
M	KORBEN	We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
M	AKANIT	One more shot and we start killing hostages, got that?
M	KORBEN	Found him...
M	AKANIT	Send someone to negotiate!
M	KORBEN	Mind if I go? I'm an excellent negotiator.
M	COP 1	Uh... Sure, go ahead.
M	COP 1	We're sending someone in who's authorized to negotiate.
M	KORBEN	Anyone else want to negotiate?
M	COP 2	Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?
M	MUNRO	From us!
M	CORNELIUS	You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
M	KORBEN	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
M	CORNELIUS	Leeloo's in trouble?
M	KORBEN	When is she not in trouble?
M	CORNELIUS	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
M	POLICEMAN	More trouble?
F	ZORG	Nothing I can't fix myself.
M	KORBEN	Leeloo?
F	LEELOO	Korben...
M	LOC RHOD	Korben man... what the hell is this?
M	KORBEN	A molecular bomb.
M	LOC RHOD	And, uh, what're these numbers clicking by?
M	CORNELIUS	Probably the time remaining before it explodes.
M	LOC RHOD	You're just saying that to scare me! Right? If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off. There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	This is a Type A alert. For security reasons the hotel must be evacuated. Please proceed calmly to the lifeboats located in the main hallways.
M	LOC RHOD	Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
M	KORBEN	Not without Leeloo.
M	LOC RHOD	Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh, like, we're down to 2 minutes here...
M	KORBEN	It's the latest model.. I've never seen one before... it works off a magnetic coded card... Let's see if I can rig it up.
M	LOC RHOD	Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!
M	KORBEN	Don't worry, I'm here now!
M	KORBEN	Just relax. I've got the Stones. Everything's going to be fine.
M	LOC RHOD	Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
M	KORBEN	I'll be right back.
F	ZORG	Allow me...
F	ZORG	Just for the fun of it.
F	ZORG	Well, what do we have here? Is this Korben Dallas? The famous winner of the Gemini Croquette contest? Or is this Korben Dallas from Special Section sent by old Lindberg himself.
F	ZORG	...In any event, whoever you are, I was glad to meet you.
F	ZORG	...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off 3000 rounds... did I?
M	KORBEN	Don't you know how to count. It's not all that hard. Watch!
M	KORBEN	One! That's for trying to kill me!
M	KORBEN	Two! That's for firing me! Three! That's for pushing around a priest! And the rest is for what you did to my wife!
M	KORBEN	We're outta here!
M	LOC RHOD	Are you nuts, Father? That hurts! I can't feel my teeth.
M	CORNELIUS	Doesn't matter all you need are your legs.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Two minutes to complete evacuation...
F	ZORG	I didn't fire three thousand rounds... One minute to total evacuation...
M	LOC RHOD	You know how to fly this thing?
M	KORBEN	It's like a cab isn't it?
M	VOICE	30 seconds...
M	KORBEN	Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
F	ZORG	Maximum Protection.
M	KORBEN	Found it?
M	LOC RHOD	I don't even know what I'm looking for!
M	KORBEN	Fuck it! Hold tight!
M	KORBEN	Solid little jobs, aren't they?
M	LOC RHOD	Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
M	VOCODER (O.S.)	Beep. End of transmission.
M	LOC RHOD	The best show I ever did!
F	ZORG	How's that? Can you hear me better now? Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
F	ZORG	Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
M	SECRETARY (O.S.)	Yes, Sir!
F	ZORG	Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
M	SECRETARY (O.S.)	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
F	ZORG	I'm not at the hotel!
F	ZORG	Hello?...
M	BEEPER (O.S.)	Battery dead.
F	ZORG	Stay calm.... stay calm...
M	MUNRO	Major Dallas has the Five Elements on board. The priest is guiding them directly to the temple.
M	PRESIDENT	Thank God! We've been saved!
M	SCIENTIST	Mr. President.
M	PRESIDENT	Yes? Now, what?
M	PRESIDENT	What do you mean, "its advancing"?!
M	COMMANDER	It's not only advancing, but it's moving at incredible speed! We're having trouble following it.
M	PRESIDENT	...And... Do you have any idea where it's heading?
M	KORBEN	Apipoulai..
F	LEELOO	I'm so very sad.
M	KORBEN	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
F	LEELOO	Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
M	KORBEN	I told you not to read all that crap!
F	LEELOO	Protect life... Until death.
M	CORNELIUS	There's a General on the phone... His name's Mambo, I think.
M	MUNRO	Munro here. President Lindberg wants to talk to you. Hold the line.
M	PRESIDENT	Major, first off, I want to thank you, in my name and in the name of the Federation...
M	PRESIDENT (O.S.)	For the praiseworthy courage you have shown us! I'd like to congratulate General Munro for his choice. He found the ideal man for such a...
M	KORBEN	So now what's the problem?
M	PRESIDENT	There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for the earth. And we have no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.
M	KORBEN	How much time before the collision?
M	SCIENTIST	If its speed remains constant... in an hour and 57 minutes.
M	KORBEN (O.S.)	I'll call you back in two hours. Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along. David appears at the door of the
M	DAVID	You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
M	CORNELIUS	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
M	KORBEN	Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray later?
M	MUNRO	They just landed in the desert.
M	PRESIDENT	How much time is left?
M	SCIENTIST	About nine minutes.
M	CORNELIUS	Uh, this one... must be water!
M	KORBEN	Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
M	CORNELIUS	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
M	KORBEN	Match the symbols!
M	LOC RHOD	What is this some kinda game? Like chess?
M	KORBEN	No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure out where these Stones go in five minutes, we're all dead! Think you got it?
M	KORBEN	There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
M	CORNELIUS	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
M	KORBEN	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
M	CORNELIUS	That's what I'm saying.
M	KORBEN	Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
F	LEELOO	The wind blows... the fire burns...
M	KORBEN	I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
F	LEELOO	...The rain falls... He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.
M	KORBEN	The rain falls... the wind blows?
M	KORBEN	Try and figure out how this fucking thing opens, instead of staring at me like that!
M	LOC RHOD	I'm looking, I'm looking.
M	SCIENTIST	...Three minutes.
M	MUNRO	We've lost contact with them.
M	LOC RHOD	...we'll never make it.
M	LOC RHOD	It... it moved! Korben! Korben!
M	KORBEN	What did you say? What did you do?
M	LOC RHOD	Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
M	KORBEN	Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
M	LOC RHOD	I was like this... With my hands here and... I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!
M	KORBEN	Is that all?
M	LOC RHOD	Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
M	KORBEN	The wind! The wind blows...
M	KORBEN	Quickly, everyone on a Stone! Water for water! Fire for fire! Earth for earth!
M	LOC RHOD	I don't have a light. I stopped smoking last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...
M	KORBEN	Don't breathe.
M	SCIENTIST	Two more minutes.
M	KORBEN	It's up to you now, Angel!
F	LEELOO	I'm so tired...
M	KORBEN	You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
F	LEELOO	I want to sleep... forever...
M	KORBEN	Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
M	CORNELIUS	Come on Leeloo! Come on!
M	SCIENTIST	It'll be entering the atmosphere in one minute.
M	KORBEN	Leeloo! If you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die! And that's not on my agenda for today.
F	LEELOO	What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
M	KORBEN	You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
F	LEELOO	...Like love...
M	KORBEN	Exactly.
F	LEELOO	But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
F	LEELOO	I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
M	KORBEN	Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
F	LEELOO	Why?... Why would you need me?
M	KORBEN	Because...
M	CORNELIUS	Tell her, for God's sake!
M	KORBEN	Because...
F	LEELOO	Tell me...
M	KORBEN	I love you...
F	LEELOO	Now you're allowed to kiss me. Strangely enough, it looks like the moon. Everything is calm around it.
M	SCIENTIST	The planet seems to have stopped at... 62 miles from impact.
M	LOC RHOD	This guy is a killer with the babes. I knew it from the moment I laid eyes on him.
M	MUNRO	Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
M	MACTILBURGH	It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
M	PRESIDENT	Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?
M	MACTILBURGH	They were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning..
M	PRESIDENT	I have 19 more meetings after this one Professor..
M	PROFESSOR	Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.
F	AIDE	We go live in one minute, Mr. President. Mactilburgh looks troubled.
M	MACTILBURGH	I.. uh.. they need five more minutes, Mr. President.
F	AIDE	No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...
M	PRESIDENT	Who is it?
F	AIDE	Some woman... claims she's Korben's mother...
M	PRESIDENT	Give it here...
M	PRESIDENT	Mrs. Dallas, this in the President. On behalf of the entire Federation, I would like to thank... Don't pull that crap with me, Finger... I'd recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain storm. You tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz for the way he's ignored his mother... when I think of all I sacrificed for him... Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.
