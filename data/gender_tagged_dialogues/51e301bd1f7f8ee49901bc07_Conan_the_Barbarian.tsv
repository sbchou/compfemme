M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NARRATOR (V.O)	In between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles under the stars. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a king born of battle.
M	CORIN	Islene!!!
M	AESIR	Now, now little whore. Did I get you or your little one?
M	ISLENE	I'd ask you the same.
M	ISLENE (CONT'D)	Take your child.
M	CORIN	I cannot.
M	ISLENE	There is no time, husband. I would see my child's face.
M	ISLENE (CONT'D)	A boy. He will be strong. A warrior with no equal.
M	CORIN	Do not speak, love.
M	ISLENE	You have never been able to still my tongue, and you will not this day. He will be wild, Corin. You must temper him. Conan. His--name--is--Conan.
M	URAN	A Cimmerian warrior is like any other man. A Cimmerian warrior feels hunger. He feels cold. Like other men he may lie and cheat. But when a Cimmerian warrior hungers, he hungers only for the blood of his enemy. When he feels cold, it is the cold steel of his sword. When he lies, he lies in wait for his enemy. And when he cheats, he cheats death itself! Conan! You are too young to be here. Withdraw.
M	LARGEST TEEN	He said leave, motherless whelp.
M	URAN	In the black crag in the high pass stands a wooden training sword. The one who claims it, with stone still in his mouth, will have earned the right to train with the warriors.
M	URAN (CONT'D)	Well? What are you waiting for?! And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
M	CIMMERIAN BOY	Conan! Run!
M	CORIN	Conan? Conan?! What have you done, boy?
F	CONAN	They killed one. I killed three. I am a warrior now.
M	CORIN	A warrior? What you have done a jackal would do. Never a warrior.
F	CONAN	They would have done the same --
M	CORIN	As I said, jackals. He is not ready. I will forge him myself.
M	CORIN	Stoke your fire, boy.
F	CONAN	"Stoke your fire, chop your wood." I have slept where wolves dare not. I have balanced a thousand river stones. When will you teach me the sword?
M	CORIN	Think you're ready? Then tell me: what is a sword's purpose?
F	CONAN	To slay ones enemies.
M	CORIN	No. That is what it does. Its purpose is why you use it.
M	CORIN (CONT'D)	Tell me, which makes the best sword?
M	CORIN (CONT'D)	The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall make a sword of it, and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields.
F	CONAN	Why did it break?
M	CORIN	Because it had no life.
M	CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)	The strongest blade isn't made of the hardest steel, boy. The hardest ore is what a man will die for. It is strong and unyielding. It neither cowers nor concedes. But without the softer ore, it can be shattered like glass. The softer ore is what a man lives for. It is flexible and lasting. It survives, even against the greatest of foes. But too much of the soft ore, the blade will not cut deep enough when it must.
M	CORIN (CONT'D)	A sword must be tempered, the two ores united through fire and ice. Through its suffering the sword comes to hold both life and death.
M	CORIN (CONT'D)	Now tell me, what is this sword's purpose?
M	CORIN (CONT'D)	This one is not ready yet.
M	CIMMERIAN SENTRY	See something?
M	UKAFA	That's the last of their guard towers.
M	LUCIUS	All this sneaking around for a lowly tribe of barbarians.
M	KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)	This lowly tribe of barbarians have buried every warrior ever to set foot on this land, Lucius.
M	LUCIUS	That is only because they have never faced my legion.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Then show us. But should you fail, remember the plan.
M	CORIN	Conan?
M	LUCIUS	Retreat!
M	CORIN	Wait! Hold your ground!
M	URAN	Death is in the air, invaders. Can you taste it?
M	LUCIUS	Indeed. I savor it.
M	CHARGE --	
F	CONAN	Father!
M	CORIN	Come.
F	CONAN	Do we need more weapons?
M	CORIN	Go. There is a hunting lodge in the North Pass with provisions.
F	CONAN	No! I will fight!
M	CORIN	This fight is over, but yours has just begun. You wanted to be a warrior of the tribe, Conan--now you must be its last.
F	CONAN	Father, I am not afraid to die.
M	CORIN	Good. Make your death have purpose.
F	CONAN	No!
M	KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)	I said I wanted a word with him.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	As promised.
M	PICT	Their heads. You promised me their heads.
M	KHALAR SINGH	All you wish, once we are gone. I take no pleasure in this day, barbarian. Your people are fierce warriors, deserving of every story told of them. But now you must choose the story for yourself. I am Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked from the best Hyboria. My second, Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo and his Shadow Scouts from the jungles of Zingara. And countless others. They all had a day like this one. They all chose a way forward.
M	CORIN	What is it you want?
M	KHALAR SINGH	I seek neither gold nor steel, but flesh and blood. The last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years.
M	CORIN	Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each man is free here.
M	KHALAR SINGH	But I seek a woman.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	A queen in hiding. Point her out and you'll spare the lives of your own. Perhaps even your wife?
M	CORIN	My wife was killed, long ago, by swine such as you.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Then our stories began in the same place, Cimmerian. I too lost my wife to marauders. How many men, in how many lands have suffered so? The only answer is power, strength unfettered, the kind of which can unite all Hyboria under a single crown. That is the legacy I seek. Will you join me?
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Very well. Then death will be your story. Your men will die. And your women too, when I am done with them. None will survive to carry your name forth, and over time, even your enemies will forget you ever were. You will be wiped from the pages of history. Take your blood, but leave the kill.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Fariq! Come!
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Before you lies our enemy. His tribe waits for him in the beyond. What would you do?
M	FARIQ	I would cut out his eyes, father, so that he will not find them. So he will wander the afterlife forever.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Show me your strength, Fariq. Without it, you will never rule. With it, you will never be forgotten.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	You have your desire. Death has found you.
M	CORIN	Soon -- it comes for you.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Burn this place. It no longer exists.
M	BARKEEP	He's back there. What's this one done?
M	BARKEEP	What's he done?! What hasn't he done? He's bedded six of my whores and finished off three casks of mead--and he hasn't paid so much as a silver piece for it.
M	CITY GUARD #1	So have your men deal with him.
M	BARKEEP	I did.
M	CITY GUARD #2	Sounds like a real problem. Too bad we have other places to be right now.
M	BARKEEP	Just get that behemoth out of here.
M	DRUNKEN MAN	Piss-water! You'll serve my friends and I your best, barman, or you'll taste steel!
M	CITY GUARD #1	Time to leave, northerner. CONAN
F	CONAN	No, my small friends. It's time to die. Now--
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Who's first --
M	CITY GUARD #1	By the gods, he's as heavy as a horse.
M	CITY GUARD #2	Even a dead horse smells better than this.
M	LIEUTENANT	What's the charge?
M	CITY GUARD #2	Public drunkenness. Another damn hill ape who can't handle his liquor.
M	LIEUTENANT	Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
F	CONAN	Where's the Captain of the Guard?
M	LIEUTENANT	In the cells, interrogating a prisoner. And you'll get the same if you don't answer. You're accused of public drunkenness. How do you plead?
F	CONAN	In truth, I've been guilty of much. Jewels stolen from the crowns of kings, men's heads split in battle for the price of a night's drink. But through that I've searched and waited and hunted my prey.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	But drink? Haven't had a drop all night.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	The key to the cells.
M	LIEUTENANT	I don't have it. There's a guard inside the door. Only he can open it.
M	LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)	You can't kill me! He'll only open the door for me! What is it? Need to see the Captain.
M	GUARD #1	Fine, fine.
M	LUCIUS	Men! From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
M	LUCIUS (CONT'D)	You've made a huge mistake, ape. You'll never make it out of this place.
F	CONAN	I came for you, Lucius.
M	LUCIUS	You talk as though you know me, ape.
F	CONAN	I do. And I am no ape. I am Cimmerian.
M	LUCIUS	What do you want? Who are you?
F	CONAN	I'm the one who made you pretty.
M	LUCIUS	Impossible! You're dead!
F	CONAN	No. I am death. And I came a long way for you.
M	LUCIUS	Wait!! Wait!! I can tell you where the rest are.
F	CONAN	Where?
M	LUCIUS	The end of the earth. You kill me, and you'll never find them.
F	CONAN	Who are you offering?
M	LUCIUS	Who do you think? All of them. Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and Khalar Singh himself. But you have to swear you won't kill me.
F	CONAN	You have my word. You tell me where I will find Khalar Singh, and I will not kill you.
M	LUCIUS	He is in a city called on the edge of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of Hyboria. Khor Khalba. You gave your word! What are you doing?!
F	CONAN	Toasting, to our deal.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Go. You are free.
M	ONE-EYED PRISONER	I won't get far like this.
F	CONAN	The key to your shackles sits in the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
M	LUCIUS	Barbarian! I had your word! You said you would spare my life!
F	CONAN	No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
M	UKAFA	Khalar Singh, we've lost half our cavalry legion, and still Fariq presses on! We must turn back!
M	KHALAR SINGH	He says the Queen is here.
M	UKAFA	He leads us in circles. He knows nothing of leading an army --
M	KHALAR SINGH	Take care, Ukafa. You hold a special place in my kingdom, but blood you are not.
M	UKAFA	My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am simply concerned for your army.
M	KHALAR SINGH	And I would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the Queen. And in that respect, Fariq has my confidence. He knows more of the legends of Acheron than anyone.
M	FARIQ	Father, they are here! The hidden oasis, just as it was written. Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
F	TAMARA	Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
M	ILIRA	I'm bored.
F	TAMARA	Then hit yourself.
M	FASSIR (O.S.)	Is that how one shows penitence?
M	FASSIR (CONT'D)	I expect more from a queen.
M	ILIRA	I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of saying the same prayer every day.
M	FASSIR	Then you should be able to translate it from its original Acheronian.
F	TAMARA	Of course she can. She even taught it to me. "Never again."
M	FASSIR	Go on.
F	TAMARA	Never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world. Never again will innocents suffer for others' power. Never again will the Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
M	FASSIR	Very good, Tamara. You must have taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
M	FASSIR (CONT'D)	The Queen must not be captured. Take her out the North Gate. Quickly!
M	ILIRA	We can't leave them.
F	TAMARA	If you are caught, everything we live for is lost!
M	REMO	No swords. Khalar needs them alive.
F	TAMARA	Good to know.
M	REMO	The north gate. Destroy it.
F	TAMARA	Run!
M	ILIRA	We'll die!
F	TAMARA	We'll die if we stay!
F	TAMARA	NO!!!
M	KHALAR SINGH	Who was guarding that gate?
M	REMO	It was I, Lord.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Take four legions. Hunt her. Before I hunt you.
F	TAMARA	Water -- please --
M	HEAD SLAVER	The gods are good. Chain this one in my cage. She'll be the prize of the auction in Khor Kalba.
M	KHALAR SINGH	All these years searching the ends of the earth. And here you are. Just a two day ride from Khor Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
M	FASSIR	Say nothing.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't know who we are. Maybe he's not looking for the Queen.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	That's right, my brethren, you have been lied to all your lives. Told you must hide yourselves, told you were alone. I want you to look at me, and see me for what I am. A brother. A friend. I have come not to hurt you, but liberate you.
M	FASSIR	You come for your own dark purposes, to raise Acheron.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Yes. I come to resurrect the greatest empire Hyboria has ever known.
M	FASSIR	An empire of evil, soaked in blood sacrifice and the blackest of magic.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? Blood, magic, death: it is everywhere. Acheron is no different than any other kingdom, but for its glory. And in place of that glory, you offer shame? I knew shame, but that was before I was shown my true lineage.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	When I was but a child, raiders destroyed my village, cut our fathers to ribbons, and burned our women as sacrifice to foreign gods. Those few who survived, we ran for our lives, chased into caves at the edge of the Eastern Sea, left with nothing to live for. But then we discovered it. Acheron. The temple that spawned an empire. We learned that we were not broken goat- herders on a desolate coastline. We were the sons and daughters of kings. And queens.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	For thirty years I have searched for you. In that time I built both an army and empire, but they are nothing compared to what we can create together. We can raise Acheron again. Never again will we hide like rats. Never again will we watch as our loved ones are slaughtered. I call forth the Queen. Stand and join me, and this day will have a joyous end.
M	FASSIR	You would have all the world suffer, as you have suffered. We will die before we help you.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Yes. You will.
M	FARIQ	The caves beneath Khor Khalba contain all manner of creature, many -- altered -- by centuries of blood magic. But one, in particular, has developed a special connection to the blood. A thirst. It is said that only the Queen of Acheron itself can resist its embrace.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	So what say you? Will you be the lucky one, or will you tell me who is?
M	SLAVE TRADER	Wake up, slags! Smile! A new owner approaches!
F	TAMARA	Let me go. I promise you'll be rewarded.
M	SLAVE TRADER	And I would sample that reward, fair one, but you wear white.
M	SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)	Tell me, have the stars aligned and delivered a virgin slave into my care? No matter. I'll know soon enough. Good day, sir! A lone rider in a desolate land. The perfect customer for what I sell.
M	SHEMISH WOMAN	Please, master! Your gold can free me from this hole! I can bring you PLEASURE--
M	SLAVE TRADER	Silence whore!
F	CONAN	Khor Kalba. Which way?
M	SLAVE TRADER	This is the road to Khor Kalba. Ahead. Past the Great Wall.
M	ENORMOUS BOULDERS	
F	CONAN	Use your whips on the horses' legs! Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	You!
M	REMO	The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
F	CONAN	Who are you?
F	TAMARA	I am nobody.
F	CONAN	Many died to capture nobody. Get up.
F	TAMARA	And if I don't wish to ride with you?
F	TAMARA	Stop! I want water.
F	CONAN	Perhaps the slavers took your orders. I don't.
F	TAMARA	I never knew men could be so cruel. Now I wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you.
F	CONAN	You speak of animals as if they were less than men. But animals don't stab their brothers in the back or steal their mother's only possession. And they never lie.
F	TAMARA	I haven't lied.
F	CONAN	Very well. Give me your name.
F	TAMARA	I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And you?
F	CONAN	I am Conan.
F	TAMARA	Conan? That's it?
F	CONAN	What more names do I need?
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	There is only one truth I need from you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why does Khalar Singh want you?
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Then let's hope it's for your cooking.
F	CONAN	Trying to poison me? What are you doing?
F	TAMARA	Before we eat, I must pray.
F	CONAN	Crom! What would you pray for? That a bone may not get stuck in your throat? No words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you.
F	TAMARA	Then you have no faith. And I am sorry for you.
F	CONAN	I need no pity.
F	TAMARA	But you do. You live in a world that is harsh and short. Where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke. I live in a world with a purpose that guides me, where faith sustains me.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	Why did you--
F	CONAN	Don't worry. His back is broken. He won't be slinking away this time. Now, let's eat.
F	TAMARA	But -- what about him?!
F	CONAN	I enjoy a little music with my meal. Only the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and
M	REMO	Please! Mercy!
F	CONAN	You are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it. Your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are.
M	REMO	Stop! Stop! I know how make you rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar Singh? You have what he want. The girl, yes? Khalar give you anything for her. More!
F	CONAN	Why would he?
M	REMO	She could be the one.
F	CONAN	One what?
M	REMO	The one. The Queen.
F	CONAN	A queen in hiding.
M	REMO	Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring her. He wait for me now, at Great Wall. He pay you anything. More! So I should ransom her to your master? Not exactly loyal -- but still, a good idea.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	You'll help me deliver it.
M	REMO	Please! Please! I help you! I do anything you wish!
F	CONAN	Good. Die. KHALAR
M	KHALAR SINGH	He brought a message?
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for me to deliver in person.
M	UKAFA	I'll find them -- and come back with their heads.
M	FARIQ	You let the girl escape once, Ukafa. What makes you think you can do better now?
M	UKAFA	I did what?
M	FARIQ	I found the monastery. It was my understanding that you were in charge of its capture --
M	KHALAR SINGH	Enough! We will take no chances. We will pay this thief what he wants, and more. He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at
F	CONAN	Here. Eat.
F	TAMARA	Couldn't you at least cook it first?
F	CONAN	Fire draws attention.
F	TAMARA	Does it bother you, blood on your hands?
F	CONAN	The only blood on these hands I claimed with my own sword.
F	TAMARA	What does that mean?
F	CONAN	Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and Queens claim more lives than I will ever meet, and not a drop is spilled in their presence.
F	TAMARA	What are you talking about? I've done no harm to you. I've done no harm to anyone.
F	CONAN	You lie. You are the very reason my people are dead.
F	TAMARA	Are you mad? I never met your people.
F	CONAN	But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed my people, looking for you.
F	TAMARA	The one who came for us? His name is Khalar Singh?
F	CONAN	You know this.
F	TAMARA	We did not know who sought us, only that we were sought.
F	CONAN	You hid from him. And while you did, others died in your place.
F	TAMARA	If we did not hide, countless more would have been killed! You do not know what purpose he has for our queen.
F	CONAN	And I do not care, for he will not live to see it bear fruit!
F	TAMARA	Wait -- you seek to kill this Khalar? We have the same aim. He takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I have sworn an oath to protect her. I can help you.
F	CONAN	Enough lies.
F	CONAN	You will keep quiet. What use is talking? You won't believe a word I speak. I only want to know this -- how will you kill Khalar? You are too big to play the assassin.
F	CONAN	You will be the lure that will draw me close. Then I will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands.
F	TAMARA	And the archers and cavalry? They will be napping?
F	CONAN	They will not be a problem.
F	TAMARA	No. Not good enough.
F	CONAN	Did I ask?
F	TAMARA	Should you fail, I'll be left without a weapon, helpless in my enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
F	CONAN	I will not fail.
M	FARIQ	Let me take care of this thief, father. He's beneath your notice.
M	KHALAR SINGH	He killed Remo, likely his cavalry legion as well. Whatever he is, he is more than a mere thief.
F	CONAN	Be still!
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	I have what you want! Where's my gold?!
M	KHALAR SINGH	Triple your price. Come and claim it. Send her to me.
F	CONAN	Send the gold.
M	KHALAR SINGH	You're fast. But are you fast enough?
M	FARIQ	You should have run, while you could.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Fariq!
F	CONAN	I was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering.
M	KHALAR SINGH	I wasn't cowering. I was studying. You're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. Your speed and power makes up for a lack of -- finesse. I've seen such fighting before -- Cimmerian.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Cimmerian it is. Now it makes sense. You came for blood, not gold.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Your people barely afforded me a challenge. You're little more than beasts.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	You've come a long way, barbarian, only to fail.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	So much for vengeance. Get me oil -- and a torch.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Is that really the best you could do? Is that as far as you could think ahead? Just rush in and kill me?
M	CHEREN	No!!
M	KHALAR SINGH	Ukafa, you will take half our forces North, to the Sea. I will take the rest South.
M	FARIQ	What of me, father?
M	KHALAR SINGH	You will return to Khor Kalba. You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen.
M	FARIQ	I will not. I will track the barbarian with you --
M	KHALAR SINGH	You think I care what you wish?! You want to play warrior? It is not in you. One day you will be king, but warlord, never.
M	FARIQ	I can. Let me prove it to you!
M	KHALAR SINGH	You will not risk your life again. You are my line, my successor. You will not throw away all that I have worked for.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	If I find you smiling before you bring me the girl, I will take every tooth I see.
M	CORIN (O.S.)	More wood boy! We must test the steel with our fire. But when he hands them to his father, he notices his father
M	CORIN (CONT'D)	What are you waiting for? The fire is dying.
F	CONAN	It's not enough. I've failed you father.
M	CORIN	It will never be enough, Conan.
F	CONAN	I don't understand --
M	CORIN	Through suffering, you will learn your purpose, boy. And you have not begun to suffer yet.
F	TAMARA	I wouldn't move so fast. I bound your wounds as best I could, but I'm no healer.
F	CONAN	Where am I?
F	TAMARA	On the Wasp. You told me where it laid, just before you passed out. Though I can't say as I feel much safer here.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	Don't embarrass me with thanks, I only saved your life.
F	CONAN	You were -- adequate.
M	ARTUS	Look what we have here. A hill ape in over his head.
F	CONAN	I was just wondering what that smell was. Now I know.
M	ARTUS	We take no stowaways. Only paying passengers. You've best be laden with gold.
F	CONAN	If it's metal you seek, perhaps you'd settle for steel.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Still fast Artus.
M	ARTUS	Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly handsome. All hail Conan!
M	PIRATES	All hail Conan!
M	ARTUS	Sorry, friend. Looks like you've had a rough road.
F	CONAN	It won't get easier. Khalar Singh lives. He'll be coming for me and the girl.
M	ARTUS	Good. We're scrapping for a fight these days.
F	CONAN	This one may be more than you wish. I need you to get me close to Khor Kalba.
M	ARTUS	Rest up. We'll get you there.
F	TAMARA	We go to Khor Kalba?
F	CONAN	I do.
F	TAMARA	No. We do.
F	CONAN	Just leave me to sleep.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	You would risk your life for royalty? Why?
F	TAMARA	Because she represent freedom, not just ours but all Hyboria's. What do you know of Acheron?
F	CONAN	A tall tale. Meant to scare children.
F	TAMARA	It is no fable. It's my people's history. Acheron was an empire that swallowed all of Hyboria, led by the King and his legion of demon warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable. Immortal. But still it had one weakness. For the true power of Acheron laid not with its King, but the Queen. Every twenty years, a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron. Spikes would pierce her, slowly drain her precious blood, and through her suffering Acheron would remain invincible. Until one of my ancestors, an Acheronian himself, put a stop to this tyranny. He and others spirited the new Queen away, hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again.
F	CONAN	What care I for queens and empires?
F	TAMARA	Didn't you hear me? This evil faces us all. All of civilization will fall if the army of Acheron is raised again.
F	CONAN	I heard. Only I would happily put all of your "civilization" to the torch myself.
F	TAMARA	But -- you owe me a debt, you thankless oaf!
F	CONAN	My only debt is to my people. And it still lies unpaid.
M	SAILOR	It was a pirate ship. They left as soon as the girl and the large one boarded.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Which way did they sail?
M	SAILOR	North.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Are you certain?
M	SAILOR	Yes, please, I'm telling you the truth!
M	KHALAR SINGH	Send word to Ukafa. They come to him by sea.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Find me a warship.
M	ARTUS	Try not to taste it going down would be my advice.
F	TAMARA	You've known Conan long?
M	ARTUS	We sailed with him for a while. I would like to say I know the man.
F	TAMARA	He is a riddle to me.
M	ARTUS	Aye, he's that too.
F	TAMARA	We have the same goal. Why will he not trust me?
M	ARTUS	Why would he? He's a stranger in every land he trods. A man with no home, no people, none but the company of ghosts. And he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day.
F	TAMARA	That is no way to live.
M	ARTUS	He doesn't live. I've seen in him great mirth, only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy. He owes a blood debt, and he can entertain no other joy, no other cause, until it is fulfilled.
F	TAMARA	And yet you call him friend, and risk death to help him.
M	ARTUS	Let me tell you something of Conan. He will never lie. He will never break a trust, once given. And he will never, ever give up.
F	TAMARA	He's a stubborn ass.
M	ARTUS	He is that, lass. He is that.
M	FARIQ	Here we stand again. Will the queen reveal herself, or must another innocent suffer?
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	My father, he tires of your charade. He grows impatient. But I have no such haste. I enjoy watching you squirm.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	Perhaps you'd like to see the end your sisters faced back at the monastery?
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	No? Your fear is not enough yet? Let's try harder.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	I've read all there is to know of mighty Acheron. Why would true Acheronians protect a traitor to their own? You once held the entire world in your grasp, now you hide and cower like pitiful mice.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	And mice are meant to be swallowed whole.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	What was in the box could only drink from you one at a time. But the beast of Acheron, it will claim four of you this night. Who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen?
M	FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)	I am here, swine.
M	FEMALE MONK	I am the one you seek.
M	FARIQ	At last. Some bravery. But of course, you wouldn't expect me to take your word, would you?
F	TAMARA	No!!!
M	CONAN (O.S.)	I hope I awoke with less clamor.
F	TAMARA	You're drinking? You were near death this time yesterday.
F	CONAN	Is there a better reason to drink?
F	TAMARA	Do you think--I could try some of that? I'm curious of its taste.
F	CONAN	You've never tasted mead?
F	TAMARA	It's good.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	Let me ask you something. Once you've killed Khalar and claimed your vengeance, then what? You will be free from your ghosts. What of your future, Conan?
F	CONAN	I have no future. It died with my people, as I should have.
F	TAMARA	So your life is penance? For what, for living? And when you too die, what do you believe happens then?
F	CONAN	Nothing.
F	TAMARA	Nothing? I couldn't live without some kind of belief in the world after this.
F	CONAN	I believe in the cold of steel, the warmth of flesh. All else is fairy tales.
F	TAMARA	Perhaps. But I still die with faith in my heart, belief in something greater than one's self. What will you die with?
F	CONAN	Purpose. I die with purpose.
M	PIRATE 1	To stations! To stations!
M	ARTUS	What do you think? They have us outnumbered, but we might beat their speed.
F	CONAN	That is what they wish. They drive us to another force, approaching from the south.
M	ARTUS	Then we fight?
F	CONAN	No. We give them what they think they want. About ship! Now!
M	CAPTAIN	They're turning to run.
M	UKAFA	Good. We only need stay close.
M	ARTUS	And now?
F	CONAN	Let us show them why she is called the Wasp.
F	TAMARA	Why is she called the Wasp?
M	ARTUS	Open astern! Load the stinger! THE BLACK WARSHIP
M	CAPTAIN	They are doing -- something.
F	CONAN	Fire!
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Rip her apart!
M	SAILOR	We're taking on water!
M	CAPTAIN	Hard to port!
M	UKAFA	No. Let them fire again!
M	CAPTAIN	We will sink.
M	UKAFA	So be it. Get below. Be ready.
M	GALLEY	
F	CONAN	Fire!
M	UKAFA	Now!
M	ARTUS	Bring her back!
M	ARTUS (CONT'D)	She's dead in the water!
F	CONAN	Good. I was growing weary with boredom.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Hide her below.
M	BATTLE	
M	UKAFA	Find the girl!
M	UKAFA (CONT'D)	We are each the last of our tribe, Cimmerian. Yours dies this day. Your head will top my spear today, but know Khalar's pig son will soon share your fate. Now finally, you die.
F	CONAN	Time to go.
M	ARTUS	I could get you closer. Another half day along the coast --
F	CONAN	I need you head west, to draw off our pursuers. I'll find another path to Khor Kalba.
M	ARTUS	So be it. Swift wind at your backs.
F	TAMARA	So you are taking me with you to Khor Kalba.
F	CONAN	I never said that. But I won't leave a virgin onboard a pirate ship, alone.
F	TAMARA	I -- but -- who said I was a virgin?
F	CONAN	We'll rest here until morning.
F	TAMARA	Will I awake alone? Do you intend to leave me?
F	CONAN	I would do you a kindness. Khor Kalba will bring only death.
F	TAMARA	Please, Conan. Artus told me of how you lost your tribe. I too had to watch as my people were taken from me.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	All I ask is that you let me travel with you. I too have a purpose. I must get to the queen. I would rather you kill me here, than fail her again.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	I was wrong about you. You are no fearless warrior. Your heart is closed to all but fear -- and hate.
F	CONAN	We leave at dawn. I will not break stride for you. Not once. I will get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond that I have my purpose, and you yours.
F	TAMARA	Nice fire. Does it mean you'll actually cook the meat this time?
M	CAPTAIN	The pirate ship sailed to the west. Even under full sail it'll be no easy task to overtake her.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Fariq has done well. Head east, back to Khor Kalba.
M	CAPTAIN	But our chase points the other way.
M	KHALAR SINGH	The chase is over. They come to me now. Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He
F	TAMARA	What were the women of your tribe like, Conan?
F	CONAN	They fought beside the men.
F	TAMARA	So they were equals. And your mother?
F	CONAN	She died in battle, even as I was born.
F	TAMARA	So you never knew her. It was the same with me. I've always known being a mother was somehow not my fate. But--
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	You said earlier Khor Kalba will bring only death. Were you trying to scare me, or do you really believe our end lies there?
F	CONAN	I don't lie.
F	TAMARA	Then we don't have much time. Your mother perished too young, but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	So -- do you care, Conan?
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	I've only ever heard you speak of what you'd die for, Conan. What would you live for?
F	CONAN	Do you ever tire of talking? Let me rest, woman.
F	TAMARA	I thought that may work.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	I see you clearly now, finally, after all this time. I would be that which you live for, Conan, if you would have me. You may have faith in nothing, Conan -- but I have faith in you.
F	CONAN	We'll slip in, along with those traders. But you'll need a change of clothes, those monks' robes will draw attention.
F	TAMARA	What will I wear?
F	TAMARA	I don't understand why I couldn't be dressed as you are. I look like a whore.
F	CONAN	And what better disguise for a monk? Do not test me, beast.
F	TAMARA	Is there not a living thing you can be at peace with?
F	CONAN	It's probably only way into Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night.
F	TAMARA	So we must try to scale the cliff.
F	CONAN	And dodge arrows as we do so?
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	During the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb. And it would be useless to even attempt at night. No, we must find another way.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Halt.
F	CONAN	Thieves. You'll regret finding me. I think not.
M	ONE EYED THIEF	It took longer than you think to cut this out of Lucius' stomach. After all that work, I figured I'd keep it -- for old times' sake. What? Do you wish to join in?
M	ONE EYED THIEF	--so you were right about the platform. You'll be long dead before you make it top. Same with scaling the cliff. There's no known way to break into the fortress.
F	CONAN	So that's it?
M	ONE EYED THIEF	I didn't say that. I just said there's no known way in -- because no one has ever tried to. But breaking out -- that's another story. It's not much easier, but it's possible.
M	ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)	You just need to find someone crazy enough to show you the way.
M	ONE EYED THIEF	These catacombs run underneath the entire city, even to the cistern that drains out from the fortress dungeon.
F	TAMARA	Catacombs? You mean sewers.
M	ONE EYED THIEF	Piss and shit are the last things you need to worry about down here. Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its
F	CONAN	What is it?
F	TAMARA	A warning. These catacombs are connected to the sea. It says that the beasts of Acheron protect its secrets.
F	CONAN	Not from me.
M	ONE EYED THIEF	Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've heard too much about what lies within to go any further.
F	TAMARA	Where now?
F	CONAN	Around. Up.
F	CONAN	
F	TAMARA	Oh!!!
F	CONAN	What?
F	TAMARA	Something touched me. Something slimy.
F	CONAN	Crom! Stop wasting time.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Crom indeed. Let's go.
F	TAMARA	What is that?
F	CONAN	Nothing good.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Welcome.
M	AKHUN	Which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl, lives.
F	CONAN	Stay behind me.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Who dies first?
M	TENTACLED MONSTER	Crom!
M	AKHUN	Get her! TAMARA
M	AKHUN (CONT'D)	You'll make a nice meal.
F	TAMARA	Where is Ilira?
M	FEMALE MONK	She was taken away by Fariq.
F	TAMARA	Then I'm too late.
M	ELDER MONK	No. She was just taken this morning. It's not yet midnight, and Khalar still must bring her to the cave of Acheron.
F	CONAN	You're going to fight Khalar's troops? Just you?
F	TAMARA	Cimmerians aren't the only women who know how to fight. And to kill.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	Our duty was to keep the queen safe. We failed. But if Khalar brings her to Acheron, it will rise again -- and all our peoples' sacrifice is for nothing.
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	So if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight -- she must be already dead.
F	CONAN	You want my help again.
F	TAMARA	No. You kept your word, I'll keep mine. I pray you fulfill your debt.
M	ELDER MONK	Guard.
F	TAMARA	Don't kill him. We need to find out which way Ilira was taken.
F	TAMARA	Tell us where the last girl was taken.
M	CONAN (O.S.)	Let me ask.
F	TAMARA	Your debt --
F	CONAN	Will be where your queen is.
F	TAMARA	Ilira!
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	She's dead. It's over.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Not yet.
M	KHALAR SINGH	It's only begun. Because that one was not the heir to Acheron.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	She is.
F	TAMARA	No. It can't be --
M	KHALAR SINGH	Secretive, the traitors of Acheron. It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl. That poor innocent was forced to live a lie, even as the truth was kept from the queen herself. And you did the rest, barbarian. My thanks for delivering the Queen to me.
F	TAMARA	No!
M	FARIQ	At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's been hours you've made me wait for my fun.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	You made me lose face in front of my father. That wasn't wise. But what should I expect from a Cimmerian?
F	CONAN	A swift end!
M	FARIQ	Hardly. But that is a difference between you and me. A swift end would be a mercy I do not intend to grant. No, you must suffer for your transgressions.
M	FARIQ (CONT'D)	You must beg for your suffering to end. Just as your people did.
F	CONAN	You lie. I was there. My father never uttered a sound.
M	FARIQ	You were there? What were you doing, warrior? Watching your father die, without saying a sound? Taking your eyes will be justice indeed, coward.
F	CONAN	I saw my father die. Slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees.
M	FARIQ	I've killed many in battle, cur.
F	CONAN	Really? Then why did your father not let you face me before, when I had sword in hand. He thought you unequal to the task.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Coward! Prove your strength!
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.
F	TAMARA	This is no empire, only a graveyard.
M	KHALAR SINGH	You see only with your eyes.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Close the gates and stay here. Send my son to me when he arrives. You two, come with me.
M	KHALAR SINGH	The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	For a hundred generations the kings of Acheron were crowned, and the queens were sacrificed. What a day for you. This morning you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you are a queen giving birth to an empire.
F	TAMARA	Stop. You don't know what you are about to do.
M	KHALAR SINGH	But I do. For thirty years I have dreamed of this day. The day our people rise from the ashes.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	It begins. You give birth to an empire.
F	CONAN	Crom.
M	KHALAR SINGH	It's good that you pray. Gods will be here soon.
F	TAMARA	He'll--be---here--sooner.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Who?
M	CONAN (O.S.)	Me!
M	KHALAR SINGH	I will say this for you, barbarian. You are hard to kill.
F	CONAN	Let her go.
M	KHALAR SINGH	You've faced me before and lost. What do you think has changed now?
F	CONAN	My purpose.
M	THE ALTAR	
M	KHALAR SINGH	You are strong, Cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal.
F	CONAN	Once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength. Now let me teach you.
M	KHALAR SINGH	No.
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Cimmerian!!!
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	The Queen. Shackle her!
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Beyond my dreams --
F	TAMARA	Conan!!!
M	KHALAR SINGH	I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron. I command you to kneel!
M	KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)	Show him the might of the army of Acheron!
M	ACHERONIAN COMMANDER	First, we feed.
M	KHALAR SINGH	Fine. Take your fill. I will kill him myself. KHALAR
F	CONAN	Your story ends here.
M	CONAN (CONT'D)	Like a woman, Fariq cried and begged me to spare him. Conan!!! They take her to a place you can never follow. Who will you fail, Cimmerian? Your father or your woman?
F	CONAN	Tamara!!
F	TAMARA	Conan!
M	TAMARA (CONT'D)	Conan, you know what you must do. Kill me.
F	CONAN	No.
F	TAMARA	It is the only way to end this. My death gives others life.
F	CONAN	I cannot.
F	TAMARA	You must. Your parents both understood that purpose. Now it is yours. Live, Conan.
M	TAMARA (O.S.)	Live, Conan. Live.
M	FADE TO BLACK.
