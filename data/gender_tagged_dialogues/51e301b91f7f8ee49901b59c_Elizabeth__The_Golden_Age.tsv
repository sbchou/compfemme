M	HOWARD	But while she lives, majesty, she is a beacon that draws our enemies' eyes and hopes.
F	ELIZABETH	While she lives?

M	HATTON (V.O.)	We believe half the nation clings to the old superstitions. ELIZABETH What would you have me do? `Cut out' half the people of England? HOWARD We must act, majesty.
