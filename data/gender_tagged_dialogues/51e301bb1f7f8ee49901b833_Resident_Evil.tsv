M	FIRST DRAFT	This text orginiated from www.New-Blood.com, please check them
M	MARCUS (filter)	Stay away from here!
M	MARCUS (cont. filter)	This lab must remain sealed! For God's sake, don't come in!
M	VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)	Look. Here.
M	CHRIS	Take it, Goliath. It's yours.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	See ya next year, guy.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Cleopatra.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Come on. Come on down.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	What's the matter, beautiful?
M	CHRIS	here, lady
F	JILL	It's my apartment.
M	CHRIS	
F	JILL	I've been awake. Since you left.
M	CHRIS	Sorry. There was... something wrong.
F	JILL	What, with my dinner? I never had a mother. I'll learn.
M	CHRIS	I'll do the cooking. On the mountain...there...must have been something... prowling around up there.
F	JILL	There are probably all kinds of things prowling around up there. In the middle of the night.
M	CHRIS	I'm sorry. Really. You...have to be there at dawn. They ride the wind over the ridge.
F	JILL	Dawn? You left at one A.M.
M	CHRIS	I had to go fishing. It's the fish that bring them down, so I can get a close look at them. (Enthused) I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill. Twelve of those big bruisers. I can actually recognize them. I've even given them names, over the years.
F	JILL	You've been doing this for years?
M	CHRIS	Only in the early Autumn. When they're' migrating.
F	JILL	I'II set the alarm for next. October.
M	JILL (cont.)	I wish I could get excited. Really. That's the truth. As excited as you, over such... simple things.
M	CHRIS	Beauty... isn't simple. If it was... I'd be beautiful.
F	JILL	You are.
M	CHRIS	No, no, no. I'm simple. You, on the other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have all that... stuff... hiding underneath somewhere. That's what fascinates me.
F	JILL	Fascination. Not love?
M	CHRIS	I... honestly don't know. I guess I've been... living alone too long. You're the first, the only woman I've ever thought of as... a real partner.
F	JILL	I've always been...afraid of living alone. I've always had... people... talking at me... knowing they could wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ... whatever they wanted. We all have... something hidden... underneath. Beauty may not be simple. But it's not all that complicated, Either. Most of the time, you find It... right in the middle of all the... confusion.
M	CHRIS	I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never confused. At least, they never let it show. The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
M	Pg-6	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
M	RAKE	Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin' around. Get in.
M	RAKE (cont.)	Swear. If I didn't know you was just an animal, I'd say you was all full of yourself. GET IN THERE!
M	RAKE (cont.)	What's wrong with you two?
M	RADIO MAN	Top brass, sir!
M	MAN WITH TATTOO	Alpha Leader.
M	VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)	How long before you get in there?
M	MAN WITH TATTOO	Fifteen minutes.
M	MAN WITH RING	You're good, soldier. But not that good. It's five hundred miles away. In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
M	MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)	We have troopers on site. A first- strike force. Under cover.
M	MAN WITH RING	Very resourceful. You have my permission activate them.
M	MAN WITH TATTOO	I've already done that. You have my permission... to say that you gave me permission.
F	JILL	(Softly) Valentine. If this is just another a drill, I'll strangle you. (She listens) Shit. Give me the activation code.
M	JILL (cont.)	a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
F	DISIMONE	Another practice run, right?
M	RUSSO	We been practicin' six months! For what?
F	JILL	For this. This is the real deal.
M	WILLIAMS	Honest to God?
F	JILL	Based on my experience, Williams, God isn't always honest
F	DISIMONE	Where we goin'?
F	JILL	In there. If you had the jing to build a place like this, would you build it in the middle of fuckin' nowhere?
M	WILLIAMS	Paris.
F	DISIMONE	Manhattan. Upper west.
F	JILL	Our orders are to secure the area.
F	DISIMONE	From what? This area's been 'secure' since the French and Indian War!
F	JILL	Bravo Team. We, er... we might be in trouble, here. WE ARE IN TROUBLE! Under attack... by.. .assailants... Unidentifi...
M	WESKER	Can you get a trace?
M	LAGUARDIA	Lost the beacon. It just cut out. Like it was...swallowed by something.
M	WESKER	I do believe, gentlemen...that we're gonna be earning some combat pay.
M	BARRY	Damn, if you don't love a fight.
M	WESKER	Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine- nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.
M	BULLHORN	There's been an accident in the hills nearby. A military aircraft, carrying live weapons, has crashed...
M	SOLDIER	Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16) You gonna be a good boy?
M	MAN	Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...
M	SOLDIER	Step aside.
M	SHERIFF	But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you. There is no immediate danger, but as a precaution, we are evacuating the area. You will be provided shelter until the weapons have been removed from the crash site.
M	SHERRIFF	That's a worn-out scenario. If a plane crashed nearby, don't you think somebody would have heard it go down? Tell us the truth, guys. What's this really about?
M	SOLDIER	I said, STEP ASIDE!
M	WESKER	Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack. I'm going on target with Alpha Team. All forces stand ready to support.
M	CHRIS	Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.
M	RAKE	outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't know what they was. Figure... maybe some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...
M	RAKE	I... I never seen 'em comin'.
M	CHRIS	Don't try to talk, Rake.
M	RAKE (cont.)	I... ain't... never left this farm... untended... since yer daddy first took it over.
M	CHRIS	I know. You... kept the place runnin'... better than me.
M	RAKE	I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy. Never even...had a chance to...turn a gun on 'em.
M	CHRIS	Where are they going? There's nothing in there... except...
M	RAKE	Y'oughta... remember it... real good. I do. From... when you was a kid.
M	CHRIS	The... the old Arkley place?
M	RAKE	I remember them days. I surely do... Remember them... them old days. I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake. You're...in a bad time. If there's any way to save you, I'll find it, I swear. You just... hang in there, old guy. I'll be right back.
M	CHRIS	Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Sorry, old hoss. The earth keeps us.
M	WESKER	You'll have to rotate or you'll run out of fuel, but I want one chopper to remain in the air at all times. We might need help in a hurry.
M	VICKERS	Holy... Goh... gaah...
M	AIKEN	You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?
M	SULLIVAN	Aiken... a guy with a brain your size would be better off dead. Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?
M	RODRIGUEZ (cont.)	I'm ready ta shoot somebody.
M	ALKEN	I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.
M	WESKER	Radio Washington. Bravo Team found on site. No survivors.
M	WESKER	We're goin' in. Watch your backs.
M	WESKER	Who fired? WHO FIRED?
M	RODRIGUEZ	Let's get inside. NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST... UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !
M	BARRY	Even-Steven, boss. You saved my ass in the desert. I saved yours I in Pennsylvania.
M	WESKER	I don't believe in being... 'Even- Steven' with anybody. A man saves my ass...I pay him back. Before this day is over, I'll pay you back, Barry. Just... stick with me, okay?
M	BARRY	Look here, man. I'd follow you into any kind of enemy fire. But these things ain't firin' at us. They want us for breakfast! When are you gonna tell us what the hell is goin' on here?
M	WESKER	When you need to know. Just do your job, soldier. That's what I'm doin'. My job.
M	AIKEN	Old. They probably don't have cable.
M	SULLIVAN	They probably don't have radio.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Who's they? Who's place is this?
M	WESKER	Guy named Arkley. Bootlegger. Built this old fortress during prohibition. He figured nobody'd ever find him out here in the back woods. Nobody did. Till he died. Feds have had it ever since. Place has been here for eighty years... derelict... a safe-house.
M	BARRY	A safe-house... for who? For what?
M	WESKER	There's a... a secret installation. Below. A network of laboratories.
F	REBECCA	What kind of... laboratories?
M	WESKER	gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay to breathe.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Why send in a strike-force?
M	SULLIVAN	Yeah. What are we supposed to do? Polish the silver? There's a man downstairs. A top- priority man. It's our job to... bring him out. Hopefully, there are others alive, as well. We'll Rescue them, too... if we can...but Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive at any and all cost.
M	WESKER	Three men stay here. Chambers...
F	REBECCA	I'm not a man.
M	WESKER	Rodriguez...
M	RODRIGUEZ	I'm better than a man.
M	WESKER	Alright. you come with us. Aiken, Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.
M	AIKEN	Why us?
M	SULLIVAN	I dunno why me. You? I guess the C.O. figures you're as worthless as a dame, Aiken. Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't ... I meant Aiken... Not you.
F	REBECCA	Relax. I get it.
M	BARRY	That thing...tells you where to go?
M	WESKER	One man stays here. Ridley. You're it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure it's not one of us. The rest of you... this way.
M	RIDLEY	Who... who's there?
M	RIDLEY	Who are you?
M	CHRIS	Who are YOU? What the hell is S.T.A.R.S.?
M	RIDLEY	How'd you get in here?
M	CHRIS	Who sealed the door?
M	RIDLEY	Who knew there a door?
M	RIDLEY	Who... who... ?
M	SPEYER	Where'd that come from?
M	BARRY	Back...where we just were.
M	SPEYER	Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!
M	SPEYER	Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.
M	BARRY	That's not what killed him. Blood's still running. Wounds are fresh. But look at his skin. This guy's been dead for a couple of days.
M	RODRIGUEZ	He was dead... before he was shot?
M	REBECCA (O.S.)	Ridley?
M	REBECCA (cont.)	Who... who are...
M	CHRIS	I... I'm one of the good guys, okay I'm just trying to...
F	REBECCA	
M	CHRIS	Shit. Pg-27
M	AIKEN	Who was that?
M	SULLIVAN	Forget him. What are they?
M	CHRIS	Somebody did some major remodeling.
F	REBECCA	We gotta get him out!
M	AIKEN	What? Smart fuckin' plants?
M	SULLIVAN	No big deal. Most-plants are smarter than you, Aiken.
M	SPEYER	Why would anyone shoot a dead man?
M	RODRIGUEZ	Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was... walkin' around?
M	BARRY	Head-shot. We were sprayin' those dogs outside... but think about it. Were any of 'em brought down without a head-shot.
F	JILL	I lost three me. You killed them, Wesker. You did... and I did. Because I didn't know what to expect... because you... didn't tell me!
M	WESKER	
F	JILL	Anything! I wasn't told anything!
M	WESKER	Put down the gun. Put down the gun.
F	JILL	Not until...
M	WESKER	RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER! How... did you get in here?
F	JILL	(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine? Good to see ya. Glad you're still alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...
M	WESKER	How did you get in here?
F	JILL	dogs got out! Through their pens! (Relaxing some) I... locked them off.
M	WESKER	Good thinking.
M	VOICE (o.s.)	MAN DOWN!
M	WESKER	Ladies first.
F	JILL	Fuck you.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Maybe... they're in the house. More of them dogs.
F	REBECCA	Diameter's too small. It... almost looks as if... it was done by a...
F	JILL	(Arriving) A human? REBECCA Yes, but... what kind of... human... would do something like this?
M	AIKEN	Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.
M	SULLIVAN	Aiken, you'd be better off...
F	REBECCA	There was a guy. Not part of the team. And there was... some kind of... plant... that seemed... alive.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Gimme a fuckin' break.
M	AIKEN	No shit. It disappeared... right into the wall.
M	WESKER	I guess it's... time to spill it.
M	WESKER (cont.)	I don't know... much more than I already told you. I'll tell you the rest now. The labs hare are... were...working on special apps for bio-eng1neered materials.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Speak English, hombre.
M	WESKER	Marcus has been experimenting with an artificial... man-made... virus. Coded...the 'T'-virus. Financing came from a private corporation, you may have heard the name... Umbrella.
F	JILL	They're... multi-national. Huge.
M	WESKER	So huge that they have... connections... in high places. That's why we're here.
M	BARRY	This virus... it jumped, right?
M	SPEYER	Shit! We're all dead! We got the bug, and we're all dead!
M	WESKER	It's not airborne. It was spread... in the water supply. Lab animals and... the researchers themselves... passed it on... by...
F	JILL	By... biting.
M	BARRY	You catch this virus and... what?
M	WESKER	You die. But... not for long. The chemical...revives the brain, and...
M	RODRIGUEZ	You stand back up... and chew on the first guy you see.
M	SPEYER	Christ, this is like... Night of the Living Dead!
M	BARRY	Why, in the name of Jesus, would anybody wanna mess with shit... that does that shit?
M	WESKER	Victory, friend. Civilization has come a long way, but we still have... war. Imagine... a soldier who can't die. That... was the concept.
F	JILL	But the virus... jumped.
M	WESKER	Hopefully... if we got all the dogs... we've contained it.
F	JILL	Hopefully? Jesus... why didn't you tell us?
M	WESKER	By telling you NOW, I've put your lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this information. Except a few high-and- mightys. Me. And now, you.
M	WESKER (cont.)	We have to get Marcus out of here. He developed this thing. He's the only one who... understands it.
F	REBECCA	I don't know, this all sounds pretty shaky to me...
M	RODRIGUEZ	Guess that proves it. A head-shot knocks 'em down.
F	REBECCA	Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking) I... I'm a doctor! I should know! That man was dead!
M	VICKERS	I hope you have a lot of these.
M	CHRIS	HEY! HEADS UP!
M	JILL (cont.)	Hang on! We're gonna get wet!
M	AIKEN	Where the fuck is a shark's brain?
M	SULLIVAN	In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you would be better off dead.
M	WESKER	Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You set off a containment breach!
F	JILL	It must have been the water. God, the water! (She turns to Chris} Did you swallow any?
M	SPEYER	I did.
M	SULLIVAN	A bunch of us did, man.
M	WESKER	Separate systems. Salt water. No germs. But.. .it breached! We can go in deeper. But we can't get out. Not with my card-key.
M	RODRIGUEZ	So...we live here now.
M	RODRIGUEZ (cont.}	Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my family out of six apartments. I got use to sayin'...'So...we live here now'.
M	WESKER	There are override exits... but I can't find them without THIS!
M	CHRIS	That was a smart move.
M	WESKER	And... you are?
M	CHRIS	Nobody. Just a...a local guy...
M	CHRIS (cont.)	...who gets pissed-off when he finds... his farm animals... and his father's oldest friend... dead. And the only woman he ever cared about turns out to be a goddam METAL HEAD!
M	WESKER	Valentine...who is this asshole?
F	JILL	His name is Chris Redfield. He was... part of my cover, sir.
M	CHRIS	Cover?
F	JILL	This is not the time to mouth off, Chris! You're in deep shit here!
M	CHRIS	Why didn't you let me in on this?
F	JILL	Why did you have to come after me? How did you get in here, anyway?
M	CHRIS	I used to play here, when this was a fucking laundry room! And what makes you think I came after YOU?
M	BARRY	(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here. Is this the pile of shit we're supposed to bring out of here?
M	WESKER	It...it once was. I got something here.
M	BARRY	A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits marked...blue and green.
M	WESKER	The greens are the overrides. (To Brad) Can you print this out?
M	VICKERS	I can try.
M	VICKERS (cont.)	(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.
M	WESKER	We have to get down to level 'D'.
M	BARRY	Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this mission was about bringin' him out, we're outta here, right?
M	WESKER	I wish we were, but no. We have a potential outbreak here. We might be the only ones who can stop it.
M	SPEYER	Stop it? How?
M	WESKER	There's... an antidote.
M	WESKER (cont.)	We can't bring Marcus out, but we can bring out the serum. Maybe somebody...can analyze it... and figure how to beat the virus.
F	JILL	
M	CHRIS	We only have to decide... what's right... and what's wrong.
F	JILL	(Privately) I forgot. You're never confused. So...what's right, Mohawk? And what's wrong?
M	VICKERS	Shit. (At the computer) There are no green exits on this level. Why... why would that be?
M	CHRIS	They don't want anybody up here to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.
M	WESKER	Pretty good guess. You must have been in the military, son.
M	CHRIS	Native American. Exempted.
M	VICKERS	There... there's no way out!
M	CHRIS	Yes there is.
M	WESKER	Not a bad idea. (Turning to Vickers) See if you can call up... service charts, schematics.
M	VICKERS	Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders. The whole infrastructure.
M	WESKER	Print it. Print all of it.
F	REBECCA	What's that from?
M	VICKERS	desk. When we were scrambling.
F	REBECCA	Lemme look at it. VICKERS (Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!
M	CHRIS	There's a... part of an old laundry chute. It might not show on there. It runs up to the kitchen.
M	WESKER	I'm not going up. I'm going down.
M	WESKER (cont.)	I'd like to let you guys off the hook. But I can't. I need back up. You're comin' with me. Any objections?
F	JILL	No objections. We'll back you up.
M	CHRIS	wind you up and you do whatever they want you to do.
M	WESKER	Stay out of this, son. You're the only one who doesn't have a choice in this. There's no place to lock you up. I can't let you go, you're a security risk. I could shoot you. Legally. But your lady-friend would probably get all over my ass. So... I'm afraid you're comin' with us... whether you like it or not. (To Jill, pointedly) He's your responsibility, Valentine. See that he doesn't make trouble.
M	CHRIS	You up to the challenge?
F	JILL	Try me.
M	CHRIS	(Snappy) I already have.
M	CHRIS	Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just... angry. When I... thought you were gone, I... Then... when I saw you. Alive. I realized that...
F	JILL	That you were still... fascinated.
M	CHRIS	Stop. Stop! Come with me. We can get out of here.
F	JILL	(Tempted) I...I want to. I want... nothing more. But... I can't. When I'm in this uniform, I'm more than... just me. Try to understand...there's no "I" in Team, Chris.
M	CHRIS	There's no "I" in DEAD, either.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	I should order you to come with me. You'd never refuse an order.
F	JILL	You go. You're not part of this.
M	CHRIS	I'm part of it as. long as you are.
M	BARRY (o.s.)	This is very uncomfortable.
M	CHRIS	For me, too, brother.
M	BARRY	It's very uncomfortable.
M	BARRY (cont.)	This is gettin' old, Man, I swear. I been in this Army eighteen years.
M	CHRIS	Eighteen years?
M	BARRY	Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.
F	JILL	Desk job, right? Nobody lasts that long if they've seen action.
M	BARRY	I've seen action in Granada. And Desert Storm. Would have lost it all there... if my buddy didn't bring in a team, against orders, to pull my ass out. Buddy named... Wesker.
M	CHRIS	You've been with this asshole since... ?
M	BARRY	Since before that. We were... kids together. Macon, Georgia. He's... only an asshole some of the time...
M	VICKERS	Who knows what we'll find down there?
M	AIKEN	Think positive. The farther down we go, the worse it's gonna get. So... until we hit bottom, we're in good shape... relatively speaking.
M	SPEYER	What the fuck?
M	VICKERS	Whatever it is.. .it can't get us. We're in the ceiling!
M	AIKEN	Maybe it's like... really tall.
M	SULLIVAN	Aiken...
M	WESKER	Main-frame. Might have some data we could use. (A quick decision) Fox, Marini, Vickers. Down.
M	CHRIS	The man has balls, I'll say that.
M	WESKER	Hustle it, Vickers. You're the guy we need. To cut into the network.
M	WESKER	Watch these entrances, guys.
M	VICKERS	AAAAH ! Shit.
M	VICKERS (cont. )	I'm alright. I'm alright.
M	WESKER	Hold tight. It doesn't sound like it's on this level.
M	VICKERS	out. Any clues for a password?
M	WESKER	Try... Umbrella.
M	VICKERS	Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No. No data. Just some kind of video feed. Time-coded. Yesterday. It's a play-back. (Watching the screen) Holy shit! Please...please.. .if anyone is receiving this... the situation is completely. out of control. We...
M	W	HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is
M	FOX	Maybe the ceiling's not such a safe place, after all.
M	WESKER	Scram! SCRAM!
M	BARRY	Haul ass, boss!
M	WESKER	That's...two I owe ya.
M	BARRY	One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .
M	WESKER	Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ... is not in my vocabulary.
M	WESKER (cont.)	Let's move.
M	CHRIS	Those things could get up here. We can't let that happen. This is our way out...
M	CHRIS	(Reading) Caruso. Can you hear me?
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Caruso! Can you hear me?
M	CHRIS	Thank you.
F	JILL	Any time. How do we get back UP?
M	CHRIS	Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you shouldn't have jumped down here.
F	JILL	We have a real problem here, Chris.
M	CHRIS	How big is this place? How many people were down here? How...
F	JILL	HOW DO WE GET UP?
M	CHRIS	(Straining) Big. Heavy.
F	JILL	It got you!
M	BARRY	No skin broken. I'm alright.
M	CHRIS	We owe you a pair of pants.
M	WESKER	Stand down. Five minutes.
M	SPEYER	I'm through, Wesker.
M	MARINI	Me too, man. This ain't nothin' I signed on for.
M	WESKER	(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.
M	MARINI	Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!
M	WESKER	You can't. (He flashes his access card.) Not without this.
M	SPEYER	Fuck you! And your fancy doors and your green key! The choppers have rockets. They can blow out a wall if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.
M	WESKER	You wanna see a wall blow, I'll blow all of 'em for ya.
M	WESKER (cont.)	I'll put a crater in this forest that takes out Racoon City and everything else for twenty miles... with this.
M	WESKER (cont.)	It's a radio detonator...to set off explosives that are...buried under neath us somewhere. The ultimate containment measure. Incinerate the place. (Smiling again) It has a... dead-man mechanism... .(he taps the ear-piece) ...that reads my pulse. My heart stops, and... boom.
M	CHRIS	You...lunatic! That damn thing can slip out of your ear by accident!
M	WESKER	That's right. It's your job...all of your jobs...to see that it doesn't. And to see that my heart... doesn't skip any beats.
M	WESKER (cont.)	Give me the radio, soldier. GIMME THE FUCKIN' RADIO, OR WE ALL GO UP! This text orginiated from www.New-Blood.com, please check us out for Resident Evil coverage.
M	SULLIVAN	Sumbitch might do it, Speyer.
M	WESKER	I'II be obliged to do it! If I don't get that antidote, I'll have to burn this place out! (Beat) Valentine. The radio.
M	CHRIS	flunky? He just threatened to blow us all up, for Christ's sake!
F	JILL	That's what I'm trying to prevent!
M	LAGUARDIA	How many digits did you receive?
M	RADIO MAN	Six. The beginning of an air- support code, but... it just went dead on me.
M	LAGUARDIA	Call S.T.A.R.S. in Washington. I want...
M	RADIO MAN	Hold it...
M	RADIO MAN (cont.)	It's Wesker. (Into mike) Yes, sir. We got the signal sir. (He clicks off) He says it was... a mistake.
M	LAGUARDIA	Call Washington anyway. I want the authority to take action if necessary.
M	MAN WITH RING (o.s.)	Holden. Denied. This is Wesker's show. If he was in real trouble, we'd have lost half of Pennsylvania by now. No authorization.
M	RADIO MAN	No independent action.
M	LAGUARDIA	Damn. I feel so fuckin'... helpless!
M	WESKER	You guys were hand-picked. A Special Unit. Most of you have been sitting on your asses, drawing pay checks for more than two years. Well... it's time to repay those... Government loans.
M	SPEYER	Bull shit. I'm not...
M	WESKER	Pitch your empties. Put all your loaded clips on that crate there. I want a count. Then I want the rounds divvied up... evenly.
M	WESKER (cont.)	Alright. We're on.. .(checking the maps) ...level "C"...
M	AIKEN	Lingerie. Notions.
M	WESKER	GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have men dead upstairs! This hell-hole is full of people who died... because of this stinkin' ...BUG!
F	JILL	Forty two.
M	SPEYER	That's all we have?
M	WESKER	We weren't expecting a war, Speyer. (To Jill) I'll take three. Three to your boyfriend...
M	CHRIS	Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.
M	WESKER	Good. Then... we all get four clips.
M	SPEYER	They must have... weapons down here, somewhere. A powder magazine.
M	WESKER	No more side trips. It was a mistake to go into that lab upstairs. My mistake. And I'm not makin' another one. From now on it's straight ahead. In and out.
M	WESKER (cont.)	Not an override. My key won't work here on the way out. Prop the door.
M	CHRIS	Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.
F	JILL	He's just... trying to get the job done. Doing what he has to do.
M	CHRIS	Yeah, well...I hope you'll say the same about me... when I do... what I have to do.
M	WESKER	which way to go.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Want me to flip a coin?
M	SULLIVAN	What's that sound like to you?
M	AlKEN	A meat-eater.
M	CHRIS	of the whole place. They've got to have it... protected somehow. DUCK! HIT THE DECK! FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN! Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins
M	SULLIVAN	There's no way outta this mousetrap!
M	RODRIGUEZ	So we live here now?
M	SPEYER	We gotta run for it.
M	AIKEN	Bad idea, Speyer.
M	CHRIS	Down. Through these.
M	VICKERS	Where do they go?
M	SULLIVAN	Does it matter?
F	JILL	On three...
M	CHRIS	One... two...
F	JILL	God...and it doesn't even stop them...
M	CHRIS	It's not meant to stop them. It's meant to stop...something else.
M	SPEYER	We damn near got turned into Rice Krispies by that gizmo of yours. If you don't want me to nail that fuckin' thing into your ear, you deactivate it. Right now.
M	WESKER	I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you can't chicken out. The system can only be turned off at the main panel.
M	BARRY	Where the hell is that?
M	WESKER	Where the explosives are. Down... farther than we need to go. We only have to make it down one more level. If... when... we make it back up to the choppers... we can fly out of the detonator's signal range.
M	CHRIS	I'm not willing to rely on that. I live here, this is my town!
M	WESKER	The town's been evacuated. Just... just in case.
M	CHRIS	That explains the lie. About the plane crash. An airplane down... with weapons on board... would nicely explain a big explosion, wouldn't it? You figured all along you might have to blow this place!
M	WESKER	I don't want to do it. I... I hope I don't have to. That's the best I can do for you, kid. Good faith. Now... let's knock on it.
M	CHRIS	I...I can't let this happen. I've got to find that bomb.
F	JILL	I'll help. Once Wesker gets what he wants, my obligation is over.
M	CHRIS	No. I want you out. With the rest of them. Wesker won't push the button until you're clear.
F	JILL	He doesn't want to push the button.
M	CHRIS	He has to. Don't you see? He can't leave these labs here. And, Jesus... walking corpses! He's gotta get rid of the evidence.
F	JILL	Chris, no!
M	CHRIS	I've got to try and stop this.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Shit. One thing after another.
M	WESKER	Sit tight. Ride it out.
F	JILL	CHRIS!
M	WESKER	This way. (He starts off.)
F	JILL	No. That way. Chris and the others...
M	WESKER	If they're dead, they're dead. If they're alive, they'll still be alive in twenty minutes. When we get back.
F	JILL	Maybe not. And how do we know it's only going to be twenty minutes? How do we know we'll be able to come back this way?
M	WESKER	We don't. But we'll do our damndest to try. This is it, guys. The home stretch. Let's go.
M	WESKER (cont.)	(Looking back) Valentine. You're on the clock! Fall in!
F	REBECCA	Th-this thing was no accident. It was cultivated!
M	CHRIS	And it didn't rip out the ceiling for the fun of it. Stay alert.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Here.
M	AIKEN	My mother made me eat vegetables. I know 'em all. This ain't one of 'em.
M	SULLIVAN	Aiken...
M	AIKEN	Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!
M	CHRIS	Get out of the away! Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!
M	AIKEN	They.. .they killed Sullivan. The bastards... whoever did this shit... they KILLED SULLIVAN!
M	CHRIS	(To Rebecca) Hold this. GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!
M	AIKEN	K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd be.. .better off dead. That...ain't never been truer than now. Kill me! We're close. I think I'll be able to get the package. It's been... very interesting.
M	VOICE IN THE ROOM	Anything you can't handle?
M	VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)	(Chuckling) There's nothing I can't handle.
M	HOLDEN	Keep us appraised. reassured, gentlemen...that every- thing is...under control.
M	WESKER	Where are the others?
F	JILL	Right behind me. Were you... talking to someone?
M	WESKER	To Washington. To my... superiors. They're your superiors too, Valentine. Don't forget that.
M	BARRY	Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'. We hit a dead end.
M	SPEYER	Us too. Cement wall.
M	VICKERS	We're never gonna get to that lab.
F	REBECCA	(Crying quietly) I... can't take this any more.
M	CHRIS	We take what comes. That's the secret of our genius.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	How old are you?
F	REBECCA	Not very old at all. Not nearly old enough to...to...
M	CHRIS	None of us is old enough for that.
F	REBECCA	Jill... told me... you were nice .
M	CHRIS	She did? She never told me. creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's
M	CHRIS	Hurry.
M	BARRY	Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!
M	WESKER	That was the idea.
M	BARRY	What idea?
M	WESKER	To win. The idea was... to win. Now that... is a metal-head.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	What d'ya think? Should I wait for orders, or just wing it?
F	JILL	Wing it!
M	CHRIS	You know...that just might be the ticket. Wing the fuckers.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Forget the head shots. They're useless. Shoot for the joints. The JOINTS!
M	SPEYER	Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!
M	BARRY	Where? As far as we'll get, either way, is a cement wall.
F	ADA	You lost a man. If I had only been faster. I was unfamiliar with the mechanism.
M	ADA (cont.)	God. One of them... is still .. Quickly. Inside. Quickly!
F	ADA	Don't worry, it's mindless. It doesn't realize that it's strong enough to push the door open.
M	BARRY (cont.)	Sometimes the dumb get lucky.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Hasn't happened to me, yet. After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark
F	ADA	My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro. As far as we know, we are the...only ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C" level. One of the biologists saved us. Brought us down here. He knew that... he didn't have long to live. He... started the mechanism... out there, in the corridor.. .and he let it... take him.
M	ADA (cont.)	I only saw it used that one time. Or perhaps...I could have been faster. The man...you lost...
M	RODRIGUEZ	You did fine, lady. We're obliged.
F	ADA	As are we. (Sighing) We believed... we would die here. Believed...the bomb would destroy us.
F	JILL	You knew.. .about the bomb?
F	ADA	it fails... must be a bomb, yes? But now... that you are here... the bomb will not come.
M	CHRIS	It... already came. ma'am. We brought it. The colonel, here... he's wearing it.
F	ADA	here to... rescue? Or destroy?
M	WESKER	If I have to pick only one... I'll pick destroy.
F	ADA	You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.
M	WESKER	Two salaries. Three if you count combat pay.
F	ADA	The man I loved, John Marcus... developed the organism that caused all this. He... he did it for humanitarian purposes. It was taken away from him...for in-human purposes...by men like you!
M	WESKER	No, ma'am. Men like me... are just errand boys. Sent in to do the wet-work. All of the glory. None of the benefits.
F	ADA	After what you've seen down here, do you think any of it could be turned into... benefit?
M	WESKER	Yes. I think it could be turned into five or ten million dollars. How do we get into "D" lab?
F	ADA	Death lab. (She slumps) John was killed...never even knowing it existed. They kept him... isolated, upstairs, while a separate team was down here...corrupting his research. Using it to build B.O.W.s.
M	CHRIS	B.O.W.s?
F	ADA	Bio-organic weapons.
F	REBECCA	The sharks. The plant.
F	ADA	Early experiments.
M	CHRIS	The snake.
F	ADA	A failure. Its behavior remained reptilian. All they could ever get it to do was... grow in size.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Those dogs. They were weapons.
F	ADA	No. They... simply became infected. As did... everyone else. Janitors. The cook. Electricians. Guards. People who believed they were serving their flag. Scientists. Great minds... turned into mindless.. .ghouls!
M	CHRIS	Before the outbreak, the experiments went further, didn't they? Those... ceiling-crawlers out there.. .
F	ADA	The product of human DNA spliced with the DNA of vicious carnivores... animals, even insects. Plated with armor, beneath newly cultivated skin. Then... injected with poison, so their biological components would die.
F	JILL	Die.
F	ADA	The "T"-virus reactivates them in a matter of minutes, but... in battle, lost minutes are... inconvenient. So, the B.O.W.s had to die... and be allowed to revive before they could be used to... full advantage. They were murdered... by their own people... so they could never be murdered again... by the enemy. Were any more of these...weapons... developed?
M	WESKER	HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?
F	ADA	You don't. It can't be opened. Thank God. None of us is cleared for that level of security.
M	WESKER	How fortunate... that I am.
M	WESKER (cont.)	Barry. Come with me. The rest of you.. .make sure this door doesn't close. Remember...
F	ADA	Have...you been leaving doors open?
F	JILL	Yes. This place is going to be overrun by...
F	REBECCA	Brad's in really bad shape.
M	REBECCA (cont.)	That's not just a scrape. You were bitten, weren't you? Pg-73
M	VICKERS	One...of the sharks. Its teeth. I Just...brushed up against its teeth...after it was dead.
F	ADA	shoot him!
F	JILL	No! We're so close. The antidote.
M	BARRY	What's got into you man? This... this isn't like you.
M	WESKER	Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.
M	WESKER (cont.)	This is...what I've been all my life. A guy... suckin' up to the honchos. Wipin' the shit off their asses... all the while lookin' for a break. A way to get some of my own! Well this it, friend. I'm myself, alright. And I know exactly what I'm doing. I told you...before this day was over... I'd pay you back.
M	RODRIGUEZ	(Looking at the gun) You know how to use that thing, chica?
F	ADA	Of course I do. I'm a scientist.
F	REBECCA	No! You can't! Not while there's still a chance to save him!
M	WESKER	Nobody knows it exists. Except us... and Holden.
M	BARRY	Holden?
M	WESKER	Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him. He signs the checks. (Excited) We've got it, Barry! Our fortune!
M	BARRY	You're not gonna try to get this big mother outta here ?
M	WESKER	Don't have to. All we need is the data. Then.. .these things can be cranked out on an assembly line! YES! This is it!
M	BARRY	What about the antidote?
M	WESKER	Antidote? (Laughing) There is no antidote. That was just happy horse shit, to keep the team going.
M	BARRY	You're gonna give this to Umbrella?
M	WESKER	No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account... right next to yours. God...damn!
M	JILL (cont.)	That thing... can't be real!
M	WESKER	It's real, alright. And it's worth... more than gold. More than uranium!
M	RODRIGUEZ	Do we get a piece of that action?
M	WESKER	All of you do. Anyone who comes out of this alive... gets a taste. I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my life. I'm happy to eat some more... as long as it's got some gravy on it.
M	WESKER	Anybody else see it my way?
F	ADA	
M	TOSHIRO	I...I want to live.
M	WESKER	Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?
M	CHRIS	And I was gonna try to disarm the bomb. This place should be destroyed! It needs to be destroyed!
M	WESKER	Gotcha, son. It's only because of Valentine, here, that I didn't squeeze the trigger.
M	CHRIS	If she's on your side... she doesn't mean shit to me. And I don't mean shit to her.
F	JILL	Chris, please. There's only... one way to go, here .
M	WESKER	That's right. My way! Yes, sir. Your way!
M	JILL (cont.)	I...can't yell you, Chris...how much I wanted...things to have turned out differently. (Beat) Goodbye. Shit. I got all my courage up... and we still have fifteen minutes!
M	BARRY	You shoot. I shoot, boss. Shit.. here I am still callin' you 'boss'.
F	JILL	We believed in you. I believed in you. Boy, was I a sucker.
F	ADA	Get out! Now! Or you never will!
M	RODRIGUEZ	So... we'll live here! (Glancing at the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks like a sonuvabitch.
F	ADA	I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!
F	JILL	Everybody! OUT!
M	CHRIS	(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.
M	BARRY	Go. You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere. Not just now, boss.
M	BARRY (cont.)	This thing gets loose, it's gonna be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it back. Give you guys a fair chance.
F	JILL	LOOK OUT!
M	WESKER	Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so help me God, you're a dead man.
M	CHRIS	Get going.
F	JILL	Not without...
M	CHRIS	MOVE!
M	WESKER	COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE! THAT'S AN ORDER !
M	CHRIS	Orders don't mean shit any more, Wesker. Especially when they come from sell-out bastards like you.
M	WESKER	B-buddy. You gotta get us out.
M	BARRY	Not sure I know how, boss. Do you? Is there some other...'need-to-know' secret for shutting down the Big Bopper, here?
M	WESKER	No. It.. it can't be shut down.
M	BARRY	The ultimate warrior. The ultimate soldier. We'll see. How it does against a couple of hard-ass career guys, like you and me.
F	ADA	The corridor outside... can be moved. You won't come out in the same place. But you'll find a freight loader that can be accessed with...
F	JILL	...a blue key. I hope.
F	ADA	No. Pot blue or green. Red. I took it from an Umbrella agent assigned to us here. He died... like all the rest.
M	CHRIS	Red... overrides green.
F	ADA	Yes.
M	CHRIS	So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.
F	ADA	I was hoping it would never be un- locked again. Go. I will see that this.. .(she holds up the data disk) ... is destroyed.
M	CHRIS	It's destroyed. It's worthless But you're not.
F	ADA	I helped develop it! Pg-82
M	CHRIS	Unwittingly. They lied to you. They lied to Marcus. They made you believe you were doing a good thing when it wasn't good at all. It was evil! The kind of evil that... resides in all of us. Makes us... greedy, uncaring. The kind of evil that will... wipe us out, in the end. Unless we stand up against it.
F	ADA	Stand up? Against powers that have... ruled the world since before we were born? We will only be...eliminated. Or locked away someplace else. I'd rather die here. Knowing that the virus has died with me .
F	JILL	What if it's already spread? You're the only one...who knew anything about it.
F	ADA	(The thought penetrating) But, I... know so little.
M	CHRIS	More than anyone else. You have... a responsibility.
F	JILL	To a higher command. The highest.
M	BARRY	That's one helluva big pump.
M	WESKER	An implant.
M	BARRY	From what? A fuckin' elephant?
M	WESKER	Rhinoceros.
M	BARRY	Shit. I figured you knew more than you were telling. How do we kill this thing?
M	WESKER	I told you, we don't. W-we can't. It's unstoppable!
F	ADA	I don't know if I can face this.
M	CHRIS	Just get us upstairs. I'll take care of it from there.
F	ADA	Alright. (With a sigh) Come.
F	ADA	Doors... were left open.
F	ADA	Step on.
F	JILL	I don't know if it's gonna happen.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Come on. I been waitin' all day for somthin. like this.
M	CHRIS	
M	RODRIGUEZ	I'm havin' too much fun. You got a lady. I just got me. Anyway... I ain't gonna die in this rat hole. I'll make it. Get outta here.
F	ADA	Have your weapons ready.
M	RODRIGUEZ	Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to
M	BARRY	Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna feed this thing a pineapple.
M	WESKER	NO! It might damage the system! I've got to get this data!
M	BARRY	Forget it. Bullets don't work!
M	WESKER	They seem to work just fine. That's it. Take a little lunch break, Mr. "T". I just need a few more seconds.
M	WESKER (cont.)	(To the computer) Come on, come on.. . EAT SHIT, YOU...
F	ADA	Level "B".
F	REBECCA	Don't see anything.
F	ADA	Good.
F	ADA	We're almost there. You'll have to jump off. The belt won't stop.
F	REBECCA	Bats! There are bats in here!
F	ADA	No. They're crows! Infected! Don't let them bite you!
M	RODRIGUEZ	Rats. FLYING RATS! AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !
M	CHRIS	
M	RODRIGUEZ	Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.
F	REBECCA	I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.
F	ADA	Climb out. OUT!
M	CHRIS	ROSIE!?
M	RODRIGUEZ	I'M ALRIGHT! Here! Here, you... lizard. You fuckin' cockroach, HERE! THING'S NOT SO STUPID!
M	CHRIS	(From above) Climb, Rosie!
F	ROSIE	No. I'm finished. I live here now.
M	CHRIS	ROSIE, NOOOOO!
F	ROSIE	EAT ME, YOU PILE OF SHIT!
F	ADA	Come.
M	CHRIS	ROSIE ...
F	ADA	COME! You convinced me that there were...larger matters. We're at the top. You said you'd get us out.
M	CHRIS	Th-this way.
F	REBECCA	Hell of a shit-house.
F	JILL	The guy was a bootlegger... with a sense of humor. Pg-92
M	CHRIS	I hope they haven't disabled this.
M	CHRIS (cont.)	Alright. We made it.
M	LAGUARDIA	I'm goin' in.
M	RADIO MAN	You don't have authority.
M	LAGUARDIA	Fuck authority.
M	CHRIS	Watch it. WATCH IIIIT!
M	RADIO	What in God's name is that thing!
M	LAGUARDIA	Somethin' we weren't supposed to see. Drop the ladder. And drop the Stinger.
M	CHRIS	GET UP!
M	RADIO MAN	Catch this!
F	JILL	Toss it to me! CHRIS!
F	JILL	have to get out of range.
M	CHRIS	No. (To the pilot) Circle around.
M	LAGUARDIA	Are there more survivors?
M	CHRIS	No. Just...circle, okay? I want to...take a last look. It's... your home. CHRIS I hoped... it would be our home.
F	JILL	I guess... we're gonna be moving.
M	CHRIS	Out of here, man! This text orginiated from www.New-Blood.com, please check them
