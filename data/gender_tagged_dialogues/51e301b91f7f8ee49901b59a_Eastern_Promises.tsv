M	OZIM	He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. Here, look... Ekrem, take this...
M	EKREM	Ozim... memnum etmek.
M	OZIM	We had a deal now he's backing out.
M	SOYKA	Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It's obviously a psychological thing...
M	OZIM	Take it Ekrem.
M	SOYKA	Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.
M	OZIM	This is the kid who walks around like Al Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca.

M	AZIZ	Speak to me...
F	ANNA	We need to get the baby out now.
M	AZIZ	OK, let's go.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	My name is Tatiana. My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. We were all buried there. Buried under the soil of Russia. That is why I left to find a better life.
F	ANNA	You had a girl. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 6.
M	AZIZ	Ok. Call it.
M	JUNIOR DOCTOR	Unidentified woman, died December 24th at 11.13.
M	NURSE	Baby girl, born December 24th at
M	AZIZ	Merry Christmas, Anna.
F	ANNA	Oh, don't be ridiculous.
M	AZIZ	And you have to open it in front of me.
M	AZIZ (CONT'D)	At least pretend.
F	ANNA	In the whole entire history of my life, I have never felt this special.
M	AZIZ	Thank you. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 7. Wear them. It's cold.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	I am so excited this morning. Yesterday a friend came back to our village and he told us all about the places on the map that I look at... Paris, Amsterdam, London. He's been there for real...
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	...he said the future of everything was already happening in all those places.
F	HELEN	Did you sleep?
F	ANNA	A bit.
F	HELEN	There's no point us tiptoeing around if you're not even sleeping.
F	ANNA	Mum? Are you OK? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 8.
F	HELEN	Of course not. It's Christmas.
F	HELEN	It's the chicken. The smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him.
F	ANNA	You should have done beef, then.
F	HELEN	It wouldn't be Christmas without tears in the gravy, would it.
M	STEPAN (V.O.)	Anna! Anna! Where did you get this?
F	HELEN	It's your own fault for giving him something to play with.
F	ANNA	Well, I can't read Russian, can I? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 9.
F	ANNA	I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found it in the handbag of a girl who died in my ward.
M	STEPAN	Do you always rob the bodies of the dead?
F	ANNA	Of course, we all do it. It's one of the perks of working in a hospital.
M	STEPAN	Did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 10.
F	ANNA	Stepan, is there an address?
M	STEPAN	You have an uncle who doesn't steal things from the dead. Not even their secrets.
F	HELEN	Oh, don't go all momentous on us, Stepan. Lift your elbows.
M	STEPAN	You should put this in her coffin, Anna. Bury her secrets with her bodies.
F	ANNA	Body. Singular.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	How long will dinner be?
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	When I was little, London was like a place in the Bible. I wasn't even sure if it was real. My friend has told me there is a place in London where they pay girls to sing. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 11. He said if I sang in this restaurant I would make more money in a week than my father made in a year.
M	KIRILL	So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Then I'll think of an excuse and we can get away.
M	NIKOLAI	I'll think of an excuse. Your excuses are like fucking fairy tales.
M	KIRILL	Who the fuck's that? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 12.
M	NIKOLAI	Maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for Christmas.
M	KIRILL	You're so... fucking unbelievably disrespectful.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Hey, you've got work to do. Go...
M	SEMYON	We are closed.
F	ANNA	I know.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Sorry... I'm a midwife. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 13.
M	SEMYON	Then unless one of my daughters is keeping something from me, you have the wrong address.
F	ANNA	I'd like to speak to the Manager.
M	SEMYON	Khitrova?
F	ANNA	My dad was Russian.
M	SEMYON	And his name?
F	ANNA	Ivan.
M	SEMYON	So, you are Anna Ivanovna.
M	SEMYON	We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill. Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for red! Come on! BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 13A. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 14.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	My angels. You should be practising. You must make the wood cry. Like this, like this... You see... overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas
M	SEMYON	Come, come, hurry, hurry. They will be here any moment. Ok, show me this card.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	It is the old card. From before the renovations. But even so, if she had worked here I would remember the name. Perhaps she ate here once. Try this.
F	ANNA	God, that's amazing. My dad made gravy just like that. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 15.
M	SEMYON	So did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died?
M	SEMYON	This is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. Maybe you will have more luck there. But I think they will be closed until New Year.
M	KIRILL	Papa, Ozim is here.
M	SEMYON	Ten minutes!! Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes! OK, Kirill, get him a drink and tell him I am coming. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 16.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help. It is sad.
F	ANNA	That's OK. I'll probably find out more when I get her diary translated.
M	SEMYON	Her diary?
F	ANNA	I found her diary in her bag.
M	SEMYON	Why did you not tell me you found a diary?
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	OK, Anna, this is how it will be. You will bring the diary here and I will translate it for you. Then if we get the names of any relatives I will call them myself. I am something of a... community leader for the Russians here in this unfriendly city. What do you say?
F	ANNA	I was going to ask my uncle....
M	SEMYON	And when you come I will make you some more gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 17.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	fish with the sauce. OK? Tomorrow, yes? Shall we say seven?
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Then it is settled. But for now, you must forgive me.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Dosvedania.
F	ANNA	Dosvedania.
M	SEMYON	Oh Anna, you always work at the Trafalgar hospital?
F	ANNA	Yes, always.
M	KIRILL	Hey, you OK? You want a drink?
F	ANNA	No, thanks. I'm driving. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 18.
M	KIRILL	OK. Merry Christmas. Drive safely.
M	NIKOLAI	Nice bike.
F	ANNA	What?
M	NIKOLAI	Nice bike.
F	ANNA	Thank you.
M	NIKOLAI	A Ural. You don't see them anymore.
F	ANNA	It was my dad's.
M	NIKOLAI	How much do you want for it?
F	ANNA	It has sentimental value. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 18A.
M	NIKOLAI	`Sentimental value'. I've heard of that. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 19.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	You're not staying for the party?
F	ANNA	No.
M	NIKOLAI	Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead?
F	ANNA	It's Christmas. Everything's closed.
M	NIKOLAI	Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know?
M	STEPAN	Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve?
F	ANNA	I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit.
F	HELEN	For as long as you want.
M	STEPAN	I knew he would run away from you. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 20.
F	ANNA	He didn't run away. You make me sound like a burning building.
M	STEPAN	Black men always run away.
F	HELEN	Oh Stepan!
M	STEPAN	What? I am allowed to be honest?
F	HELEN	He was a doctor, Stepan.
F	ANNA	with it?
M	STEPAN	It is not natural to mix race and race. That is why your baby died inside you.
F	HELEN	Stepan, shut up! Please Anna. You're just how he was. Stupid bloody drunken Russians. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 21.
F	ANNA	It's Christmas. I'm thirty-one.
F	HELEN	Anna, you know what he's like.
F	ANNA	I don't give a damn about Stepan. Who has that poor baby got in the whole world?
F	HELEN	I knew this would happen.
F	ANNA	Good. Fine. So you know everything.
F	HELEN	Anna, she isn't your responsibility.
F	ANNA	The baby is my responsibility until I hand her over to the mother. The mother is dead.
F	HELEN	Then it's up to the proper authorities.
F	ANNA	The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year.
F	HELEN	It's part of the grieving.
F	ANNA	What grieving? GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 22.
F	HELEN	In the last year you've lost your father and you lost a baby.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Come in and have your dinner.
F	ANNA	I'm not hungry.
M	KIRILL	He's called Goofy... Goofy yeah. So the coast is clear, yeah? What? I said `coast'. GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 22A.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	No, not the beach. It's an English expression, you fucking baboon. I mean... ...there are no police. You sure? Good. GREEN Revision - 11/24/06 23.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	No, my dad's not involved. I'm a big boy now. I do my own stuff. Yeah. Merry Christmas.
M	OZIM	The driver stays down here.
M	KIRILL	You really think I do this kind of thing?
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	This guy's not a driver. He's an undertaker.
M	OZIM	Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun, durgun.
M	EKREM	I got tickets, Ozim. It's with Chelsea. They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game.
M	OZIM	OK, OK, OK. You go and watch a DVD, yeah? watches him go.
M	KIRILL	He knows to say he hasn't seen us, right Ozim?
M	OZIM	He don't know anything. He's touched by the angels. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 25.
M	KIRILL	That's him.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	There was a time when he was like a brother to me.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Now he looks like a fucking ice cream.
M	OZIM	Hey, hey, show some respect for a dead man.
M	KIRILL	Respect? This is respect.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And show some respect. This Muslim is scared of ghosts.
M	NIKOLAI	Have you got a hair dryer? WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 26.
M	NIKOLAI	You'd better burn that.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Did you finish cutting his hair? I just thought you might want six- fifty out of his pockets. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 27. OK, now I'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers. You might want to leave the room.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	You too, Kirill.
M	KIRILL	Aren't you going to weight him down or something?
M	NIKOLAI	If you want to dump a body, this is the place. The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	My friend said he would get me to Amsterdam and from there we could find a way into London. I have been practising my singing and BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 28.
M	TATIANA (V.O.) (CONT'D)	have even rejoined the church choir. I am also practising my English.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	My friend says his uncle owns the restaurant where you can sing. He is sure this man will take care of me.
M	SEMYON	Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting you so early.
F	ANNA	Is it OK?
F	ANNA	I copied the whole thing.
M	SEMYON	Where is the original? WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 29.
F	ANNA	I'm going to keep it. Maybe give it to Tatiana's daughter someday.
M	SEMYON	I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Then I will bring what I have done to your home. Where do you live, Anna?
F	ANNA	Not far. I can drop by and pick it up.
M	SEMYON	Then maybe I can drive you home.
F	ANNA	I'm fine. I'm on my motorbike.
M	SEMYON	So what will happen to the poor child?
F	ANNA	After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.
M	SEMYON	Who will?
F	ANNA	The police. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 30.
F	MARIA	Grandpa.
M	SEMYON	Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.
F	MARIA	I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days.
M	SEMYON	But you have had so many presents.
F	MARIA	You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.
M	SEMYON	I know.
M	KIRILL	We're partners now, man, you know? BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 31.
M	NIKOLAI	Yeah, yeah, I know.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	What? You never seen anybody pissed before?
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Come on, Kirill. Where are your keys? Who are you, anyway?
M	NIKOLAI	We went to a Kurdish place. They don't even celebrate Christmas. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 32.
M	KIRILL	Hey, Papa, what did I do? This is Merry Christmas or what?
M	NIKOLAI	I think he's had enough.
M	SEMYON	Who... the fuck... are you to tell me enough?
M	NIKOLAI	We're partners.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	He's thunder, I'm lightning. He makes all the noise, I do all the damage.
M	SEMYON	I hired you as a driver...
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	...someone to stop him killing himself.
M	NIKOLAI	Well, you got more than a driver.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	I run a mini-cab business. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 33.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Albanians, Chechens, Russians. They deliver packages. Anything. Anywhere. I only took this job so that I could get to meet you. I think you and I could do business together.
M	SEMYON	I have no idea what business you're talking about. Now get out.
M	NIKOLAI	You've got water in it.
F	ANNA	Water? What makes you think that?
M	NIKOLAI	The postmen used these. In my village. When I was a boy. Russian copy of BMW flat twin. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 33A. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 34.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Get a bus.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	You got far to go?
F	ANNA	Just across the park.
M	NIKOLAI	I'm a driver. I even do limousines. Look...
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	If Semyon found out I let one of his guests walk home in the rain, he'd fire me. And I can take care of your bike. So...
M	NIKOLAI	So you're a midwife. Jesus. What's it like?
F	ANNA	You get used to it.
M	NIKOLAI	I didn't faint, but it was close. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 35.
F	ANNA	How many have you got? What, you don't know?
M	NIKOLAI	Yeah, I know, I know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They're back in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains.
F	ANNA	Left here.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	So Semyon employs you?
M	NIKOLAI	I'm... sort of freelance.
F	ANNA	You said he'd fire you.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Did you ever meet a girl called Tatiana?
M	NIKOLAI	I meet lots of girls called Tatiana.
F	ANNA	She was pregnant.
M	NIKOLAI	In that case, no, I never heard of her.
F	ANNA	She died last night on my shift. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 36.
M	NIKOLAI	I thought you did birth.
F	ANNA	Sometimes birth and death go together. She had needle punctures all over both arms. Dehydration, emaciation. Early presentation of syphilis. Probably a prostitute. At the age of fourteen.
M	NIKOLAI	You know what? I hate the rain. This time of year. You ever been to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow that covers your whole house.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes covered in ice. You don't want to walk across them, though. Ice gets thin where you least expect it.
F	ANNA	You think Semyon's son knew her?
M	NIKOLAI	Like I said, I'm a driver. I go left, I go right, I go straight ahead. That's it.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	What?
F	ANNA	Just here is great.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	How much do I owe you? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 37.
M	NIKOLAI	Christmas present.
M	OFFICER	We think he might be Russian Mafia.
M	YURI	He is actually a Chechen. He is also a member of the vory v zakone. The stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	In Russian prisons, your life story is written on your body in tattoos. You don't exist without tattoos. He was a captain. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 37A. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 37B.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	But he has been processed professionally. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 38.
M	OFFICER	There was something else. It was... inside the body. Chest cavity.
F	HELEN	Anna?
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Stepan, come here. Tell her what you told me.
F	ANNA	What? Stepan, what? I'm late for work.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Who gave you that?
F	HELEN	It was on the dresser.
F	ANNA	Mum, you can't go through my things. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 38A.
F	HELEN	You wanted him to translate it. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 39.
F	ANNA	And he said he wouldn't do it so I've found somebody else.
M	STEPAN	No Anna! You don't go to someone else with this! You don't go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.
M	STEPAN (CONT'D)	I go to wash my hands.
F	HELEN	Anna, Stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. Do you know what that means?
F	ANNA	Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again.
F	HELEN	You never listened to me even then!
F	ANNA	Look, if I don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put Christine out for fostering. Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again.
F	HELEN	Who named her Christine? BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 40.
F	ANNA	I had to call her something. It sounds like Christmas. She's very beautiful.
F	HELEN	If I can persuade Stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police?
F	ANNA	Tell him I've heard bad words before.
F	HELEN	Your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. There's no cure once they've touched you.
F	ANNA	Momma, this is London. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 41.
M	ALBANIAN	OK, boss is here. Boss, boss. You make him happy...
M	ALBANIAN (CONT'D)	No fucking crying. It's a party!
M	KIRILL	So he said to me, `who is this driver guy?' I laughed so hard.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	And I said you were the safest guy I'd met. Solid.
M	NIKOLAI	And what did he say?
M	KIRILL	You know my dad. He didn't say nothing. But his eyes looked impressed.
M	ALBANIAN	Kirill!
M	KIRILL	Get out of the fucking way, you black gypsy baboon. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 42.
M	KIRILL	OK, which one you going to fuck!?
M	NIKOLAI	What's it to you?
M	KIRILL	Serious. Pick one.
M	NIKOLAI	I'm just enjoying myself, man...
M	KIRILL	You hear me? You're going to fuck one of these girls.
M	NIKOLAI	OK, OK, Jesus...
M	KIRILL	You're going to fuck one of these girls right now. That's an order.
M	NIKOLAI	What? What's the matter with you? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 43.
M	KIRILL	Come on Nikolai. Who are you going to fuck?
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	I'm recommending you to my dad. I want to make sure you're not a fucking queer.
M	NIKOLAI	You've drunk enough Kirill.
M	KIRILL	Enough? You fucking Siberian ox don't tell a vor what is enough.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	I've brought you to my dad's best stable. He uses this place himself. They're all clean. Now I'm going to watch you fuck one of these girls to prove to me that you ain't queer. So which one is it going to be?
M	NIKOLAI	Her. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 44.
M	KIRILL	You did OK! You did OK.
M	NIKOLAI	Yeah?
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Well if my examination is over, get the fuck out of here while I get dressed.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	What's your last name?
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Tell me your last name.
M	GIRL	Kirilenko. GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 45.
M	NIKOLAI	Where are you from?
M	GIRL	Ukraine.
M	NIKOLAI	Where? Which village? Which town?
M	GIRL	Irpen. Outside Kiev.
M	NIKOLAI	Stay alive a little longer.
M	SEMYON	Hello Anna. I came on tiptoes.
F	ANNA	How did you get in here? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 45A.
M	SEMYON	There are always open doors, Anna Ivanovna. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 46.
F	ANNA	You're not allowed in here.
M	SEMYON	Please Anna, let me speak.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	I translated the diary... I was shocked to discover... that my son Kirill is mentioned many times.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	I have known for some years that he has strayed from the path I set out for him. His mother died when he was very young.
F	ANNA	What does it say about him?
M	SEMYON	Many bad things.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	But Anna please. Let me deal with him. If the diary should find its way to the police...
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Some of the things my son did are illegal. Anna, he is a good boy. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 47.
F	ANNA	I don't care about him. I care about the baby.
M	SEMYON	Of course. Of course. And that is the baby?
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Anna, I have made some inquiries and I have found out an address for Tatiana's family in Russia. That's where the baby belongs, no? So... perhaps we can do a deal.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Do you understand me, Anna?
M	NURSE	Anna?
F	ANNA	It's OK. He's just leaving.
M	SEMYON	You know where I am, Anna Ivanovna.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	And I know where you are. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 48.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	I was thrown down the stairs and fell onto some sacks, like potato sacks...
M	STEPAN	...like potato sacks. Kirill came down after me and he hit me until I was bleeding. Then he tried to rape me but he couldn't do it... He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. In the end his father came down. It was the father who raped me. He shouted at his son...'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, Kirill'.
F	HELEN	Hello dear. How was your night?
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Stepan's arthritis is playing up. I'm taking dictation.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Would you like some tea or something?
F	ANNA	No. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 49.
F	HELEN	What's wrong?
F	ANNA	He came to see me.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	The man from the restaurant. He came to the hospital.
M	STEPAN	I told you this would happen! I told you!
F	HELEN	Sit down Stepan.
M	STEPAN	The devil is loose now.
F	ANNA	I know it's my fault...
F	HELEN	It's no one's fault...
M	STEPAN	They are in this room now. They are cancer...
F	HELEN	We should just sit down calmly and think...
M	STEPAN	I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a gun....
F	HELEN	Stepan!!
M	STEPAN	...from the war in Afghanistan. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 50.
F	HELEN	Don't talk about guns...
F	ANNA	Shut up both of you!!! OK... now... what would dad have done?
M	STEPAN	We all know what he would have done.
F	HELEN	And then he would have been practical.
M	STEPAN	He would ask if there were bullets for the gun.
F	HELEN	No! This isn't our world. We're just... ordinary people.
M	STEPAN	I dealt with the vory v zakone when I worked for the KGB.
F	ANNA	You never worked for the fucking KGB!
F	HELEN	Anna!
M	STEPAN	I was an auxiliary! WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 51.
F	HELEN	Please! What did this man want?
F	ANNA	The diary. In return he'll give us an address for Tatiana's family. For Christine's family.
F	HELEN	And that's all he wants?
M	STEPAN	You cannot do deals with these people!
F	HELEN	This isn't a deal. It's an exchange of information.
M	STEPAN	Have you forgotten already what I just read to you?
F	HELEN	We must be practical.
F	ANNA	Stepan, I think he was threatening to harm Christine.
F	HELEN	Then it's settled.
M	STEPAN	No!! No!! No!!
F	HELEN	Stepan, this isn't our world. We are ordinary people. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 52.
M	STEPAN	She was an ordinary person.
M	KIRILL	Hey, come on, Nikolai, I've got a Christmas present for you.
M	KIRILL	Open one.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	From France. Old as fuck. Old is good with wine. Sixty quid a bottle anywhere. Except I got them for ten quid a case.
M	NIKOLAI	From where?
M	KIRILL	`From where?' From where you don't ask. Give it here... WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 53.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	If my dad says OK, I can start telling you about the serious stuff. Import, export. This booze is just for gifts to Papa's friends. The real import stuff is from Kabul, you understand?
M	NIKOLAI	Import-export sounds good.
M	KIRILL	You bet it's fucking good...
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Jesus Christ, Papa... You scared me.... What's wrong? We're just sampling it!
M	SEMYON	Your friend Soyka is dead.
M	KIRILL	Yeah? So what? What's that got to do with me?
M	SEMYON	Don't lie to me!! PINK Revision - 11/12/06 54.
M	KIRILL	I swear I don't know nothing about it...
M	SEMYON	I said, don't lie to me!
M	NIKOLAI	Your dad is right, Kirill. There's no point lying to him.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat. Kirill paid him to do it.
M	KIRILL	Shut your fucking mouth!
M	NIKOLAI	Your dad always knows the truth anyway. But it's OK boss. You don't have to worry...
M	SEMYON	I don't have to worry?
M	NIKOLAI	I disposed of the body myself. The police won't find a thing.
M	SEMYON	My son commits a murder? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 55.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	On my own doorstep? A fellow soldier! And no one thought to tell me about it?
M	NIKOLAI	The vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. Kirill is my captain.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	When I found out what had happened, I did what I had to do to clean the situation up.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	It was a matter of honor. Soyka was spreading lies about Kirill. About your family. Kirill did the right thing.
M	SEMYON	I decide what is right and what is wrong. You do not kill a vor for no reason.
M	NIKOLAI	You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police.
M	SEMYON	For a driver, you are well informed.
M	NIKOLAI	I've got connections with the Chechens who export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 56.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Kirill did a good thing for all our people. Our people will know that.
M	KIRILL	Papa, I swear to you, I was going to...
M	SEMYON	Shut up!
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	If you are so well informed, you will know Soyka has brothers.
M	NIKOLAI	That's OK. Kirill has got me.
M	SEMYON	Get these boxes out of sight.
M	KIRILL	You heard him, patsan! Get these boxes out of sight. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 57.
F	ANNA	How the hell can you eat?
M	STEPAN	I'm hungry.
F	ANNA	That's their driver.
F	HELEN	Tell me you haven't done anything ridiculous...
M	NIKOLAI	Meet in a public place with lots of people around. Very wise.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	And I see you brought along a body guard. Also very wise. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 58.
M	STEPAN	When I was in the KGB, we knew how to deal with scum like you.
M	NIKOLAI	When you were in what?
F	HELEN	Shush, Stepan. Anna?
F	ANNA	Now you give me the address.
M	NIKOLAI	What address?
F	ANNA	Tatiana's family.
M	NIKOLAI	I don't know what you're talking about.
M	STEPAN	I told you! I knew they would do this....
F	HELEN	Anna! No! Come back here! PINK Revision - 11/12/06 59.
F	ANNA	She was fourteen! Read the diary! She was fourteen when he raped her! You murdered her! You bastards murdered her!
M	NIKOLAI	Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You're in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	You belong in there. With nice people. Stay away from people like me.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	I am not sure I can carry on another day. The windows won't open so I can't throw myself out. They inject me every day with heroin. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 60.
M	TATIANA (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Sometimes I think this is all a hallucination...
M	SEMYON	It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	In this business, sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things. You can't afford to be careless in any area.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Nasdrovia.
M	NIKOLAI	Nasdrovia.
M	SEMYON	So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading about my son?
M	NIKOLAI	It was nothing important.
M	SEMYON	Kirill had him killed for nothing important?
M	NIKOLAI	I don't want to repeat it. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 61.
M	SEMYON	For me you will repeat it.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	You play with the Prince to do business with the King. But if you want to do business with me you must be open with me. Thieves- in-law.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	What was Soyka saying about the Prince?
M	NIKOLAI	That he is a drunk. And that he is also... a queer.
M	SEMYON	My only son.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	You know it never snows in this City. And it's never hot. London is a city of whores and queers. My son...
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	...I think London is to blame for what he is... WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 62.
M	NIKOLAI	So why don't you go home?
M	SEMYON	The cold gets into my bones. And also... the KGB would be waiting for me.
M	NIKOLAI	FSB. They are called FSB now.
M	SEMYON	Whatever they call them they are worse even than the KGB were. Maybe the KGB and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage. We had rules, they had rules.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Now in Moscow, the thieves don't wear tattoos and the police don't wear uniforms. You never know who they are...
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	You've heard about these new policemen?
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	They get under you, over you, behind you, inside you. They are the ones you least expect. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 63.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	The midwife said she had an uncle. A Russian.
M	NIKOLAI	I met him.
M	SEMYON	So you know what he looks like.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	She said he has read the diary.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	We can't trust a Russian with that kind of information.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Do you understand me? Perhaps you can deal with him. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 64.
M	NIKOLAI	I thought I'd bring it back before it got stolen. Lot of villains around. Sorry about the chain.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	I got that address you wanted.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	A little village outside St. Petersburg. I know it. Not much of a place for a kid to grow up in. Especially not a girl.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	If you want my opinion, the kid would be better off in London. Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's family don't sound like the kind of people who'd want another mouth to feed.
F	ANNA	You read the diary?
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	So how can you keep doing what you're doing?
M	NIKOLAI	I told you. I'm just a driver.
F	ANNA	You look the other way. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 65.
M	NIKOLAI	I'm a camera. The pictures stay in my head.
F	ANNA	Why did you bring me this?
M	NIKOLAI	I don't know. I was passing.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Oh, and... your uncle.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Is it true he was in the KGB?
F	ANNA	I don't know.
M	NIKOLAI	Well, he's a brave old man. That's for sure.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Does he live with you?
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	I fixed it. It should be OK now. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 66.
M	EKREM	Hey! Hey Kabuka Chelsea! Fuck you!! Yeah you! Aliverisme!! Fucker!
M	CHECHEN	For my brother... BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 67.
M	DISHWASHER	Guy out the back.
M	SEMYON	So what did they say?
M	OZIM	They were going to kill me. Those Chechens are savages.
M	OZIM (CONT'D)	I pointed out that I am a Muslim too and it is a sin for a Muslim to kill a Muslim.
M	SEMYON	What did they say about my son?
M	OZIM	They said they would spare me only if I delivered Kirill to them.
M	SEMYON	You are being very honest.
M	OZIM	I fear you more than I fear them. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 68.
M	SEMYON	Never again do business with any member of my family behind my back.
M	OZIM	Never. I will never listen to Kirill again. I swear...
M	SEMYON	Do they know where to find Kirill?
M	OZIM	They are like wolves.
M	SEMYON	Do they know what he looks like?
M	OZIM	No. They have just arrived from the mountains.
M	SEMYON	Then tell them you will deliver Kirill to them.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Tell them to give you two days.
M	TATIANA (V.O.)	I know now for sure that I am pregnant. It hasn't begun to show yet. After I was raped they made me take pills but I guess it was too late. I am condemned to give birth to a new life. But first I will try to find a way to end my own life and spare this child the pain.
F	ANNA	Mum... I can't get hold of Stepan.
F	HELEN	Why do you want to?
F	ANNA	I need to check something with him.
F	HELEN	Anna...
F	ANNA	He's not at home, do you know where else he might be?
F	HELEN	Anna. Haven't you had enough excitement?
F	ANNA	I think I've worked out who Christine's father is. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 70.
F	HELEN	Why does it matter?!!
F	ANNA	It matters... to me!!
F	HELEN	You enjoy this.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	You're like your father. Ordinary life isn't enough.
M	NIKOLAI	What are you doing here? PINK Revision - 11/12/06 71.
F	ANNA	I don't know. I was passing.
M	KIRILL	If you're passing, you pass. You keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come on...
F	ANNA	Family is important to you people isn't it?
M	KIRILL	'You people'? What the hell is she talking about?
F	ANNA	Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter.
M	KIRILL	What did she say?!
F	ANNA	When he raped her she was a virgin. Then they gave her pills. Semyon has to be the father! WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 72.
M	NIKOLAI	She's a civilian!
F	ANNA	She was fourteen! She was a child!
M	KIRILL	You don't use my father's name! You don't say that filth about him... Don't even look at her any more.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	That's an order.
F	ANNA	Tell him what I said.
M	NIKOLAI	There is nothing to tell. Slaves give birth to slaves...
M	KIRILL	Come on Nikolai!! BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 73.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	And if you open your mouth again, I'll tell my driver to stick his cock inside it! Understand? Maybe that's what you want!
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	You want to come in?! Maybe we all get to fuck you....
M	KIRILL	That girl you fucked in front of me... you remember her? The Ukrainian bitch?
M	NIKOLAI	No.
M	KIRILL	So they kick down the door. These are ordinary fucking police. They ask for her by name and they take her away. Some fucking punter must have given them her name. What gives the police the right to take our women, huh?
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Hey Papa, I never seen so many old people in one place. Whose party is it out there? The angel of death? WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 74.
M	SEMYON	She is one hundred years old.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Kirill, go down into the cellar and bring up some brandy. Twelve bottles.
M	KIRILL	Come on, Nikolai, help me.
M	SEMYON	No. He stays here. I want to talk business.
M	KIRILL	What business?
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Papa, what business? His business is my business.
M	SEMYON	Go to the cellar Kirill. And take your time. Did you deal with the old man? BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 75.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	It's time you joined us.
M	NIKOLAI	Thank you. Papa.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	What shall I tell Kirill?
M	SEMYON	Tell him I changed my mind about the brandy.
M	KIRILL	My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Hey, don't feel bad. What happened up there is just how he is. He plays people against each other. That's all. I realize more and more what he's like. Here, drink to the Georgian girl... PINK Revision - 11/12/06 76. What? I drink alone now.
M	NIKOLAI	He offered me stars. I accepted them.
M	KIRILL	You think I didn't know already? He told me before. It was my fucking idea. He said there are a lot of things I have to teach you.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Some stuff will take a long time. I've been protecting you until now.
M	NIKOLAI	Yeah.
M	KIRILL	What? You think I don't know stuff you don't know? I am vor by birth. The stars are a birthmark for me...
M	NIKOLAI	I know, Kirill.
M	KIRILL	Where the fuck are you going? We've got to celebrate. Help me with these bottles. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 77.
M	NIKOLAI	Your dad don't need the bottles any more.
M	KIRILL	Hey! We're still partners, right? Thunder and lightning! WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 78.
M	VALERY	We can see that you were in prison in Siberia. And that you were a thief.
M	NIKOLAI	My father was a government worker. He fixed the cars of officials. I began by selling the spare parts when I was fifteen.
M	VALERY	You have no forced tattoos?
M	NIKOLAI	None.
M	GYPSY	You were not co-operative?
M	NIKOLAI	I spent two years in the punishment block.
M	VALERY	You went through the Crosses in St. Petersburg?
M	NIKOLAI	I was in solitary confinement fifteen times. I was called 'The Stump' because they couldn't shift me.
M	VALERY	Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the Government, that's right isn't it?
M	NIKOLAI	That's right. My father means nothing to me. My Mother....
M	GYPSY	You have no mother. She was a whore anyway. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 79.
M	NIKOLAI	Yes. I have no mother and no father. There is only the code, the vory v zakone code which I have always followed.
M	VALERY	That is why there is an empty place above your heart. Where the stars will go. And why there is an empty place on your knees.
M	NIKOLAI	I am dead already. I died when I was fifteen. Now I live in the zone all the time.
M	GYPSY	You have never worked for the government? Any government?
M	NIKOLAI	I have lived off Albanians and Georgians. I steal from them within the law. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 80.
F	HELEN	Have you slept at all?
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	I tried to get hold of Stepan for you. He's usually either at home or at his sisters. But she hasn't heard from him at all.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	He did spit in that horrible man's face.
F	ANNA	I don't think the driver would do anything to Stepan. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 81.
F	HELEN	How do you know what he would do?
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	You haven't spoken to him since, have you?
M	OZIM	Semyon recommends these places for business meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has.
M	OZIM (CONT'D)	Come on. We have a lot to get through. Let's cook. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 82.
M	OZIM	Our lines to Kabul get broken every two or three weeks.
M	NIKOLAI	How come?
M	OZIM	The Americans. Fucking NATO. Valery Nabokov imports flowers and television sets into this country. The television sets are one in ten. That means one in ten have cargo inside them.
M	NIKOLAI	Where do they dock?
M	OZIM	I will tell you when I return from the bathroom. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 83-83A.
M	OZIM	Kirill is in there.
M	NIKOLAI	Ozim? instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 84.
F	ANNA	I'm so late. Sorry.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Oh God...
M	AZIZ	It's fine, although I think I've had enough.
F	ANNA	Paul, on my way here I made a decision.
M	AZIZ	You can't possibly dump me. We're not even going out.
F	ANNA	Take my hand.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Feel my pulse.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I'm going to apply to adopt Christine. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 85. Can you feel that?
M	AZIZ	Yes, I can.
M	NURSE	Anna?
F	ANNA	Is it OK to talk to him for a minute?
M	NURSE	He's still in trauma. Do you know him? WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 86.
F	ANNA	Yes.
M	NIKOLAI	I thought you did birth.
F	ANNA	My uncle....
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	...the one who spat in your face... He's disappeared. If we don't hear from him soon we're going to the police...
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Do you know where he is?
M	NIKOLAI	Yes.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	He's in Scotland. In Edinburgh. In a five-star hotel. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 87.
F	ANNA	Edinburgh?
M	NIKOLAI	I'm going to need some clothes. I arrived here without any. Can you get me some?
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	I can't walk out of here naked.
F	ANNA	You can't walk out of here because you're attached to a drip. Explain Edinburgh.
M	NIKOLAI	Your uncle knew too much.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	I was told to get rid of him. I was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. Instead I sent him to Edinburgh. With a first-class ticket.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	He is of the old school. He understood the situation. Exile or death. Edinburgh was his idea. He said they throw a great party at New Year. And he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family. So... just a pair of jeans and a T- shirt. A jacket. And some shoes. GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 88.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	The hotel is called the Caledonian.
F	ANNA	...no, I couldn't get much sense out of him, he was drunk.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Mum, I don't want to tell you how I found him because I don't want another argument. I just wanted you to know he's definitely safe...
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	No, we can't tonight. I'm working. I need the money. For a place of my own, for Christ's sake! PINK Revision - 11/12/06 89.
M	NIKOLAI	You got my message?
M	YURI	Using a dead body to file a progress report must be against FSB regulations.
M	NIKOLAI	It's called improvisation.
M	YURI	You've been improvising quite a lot lately. And taking risks.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	Maybe too many.
M	NIKOLAI	You didn't come here to give me flowers... PINK Revision - 11/12/06 90.
M	YURI	In light of what has happened to you...
M	NIKOLAI	Ah, Christ...
M	YURI	...and in light of other violent incidents associated with you, the Russian desk at Scotland Yard have made an official request to the Russian embassy that your undercover operation in London be terminated.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	You have gone beyond what was agreed. In my opinion you should see this as good news. You've been in the zone far too long...
M	YURI (CONT'D)	My God...
M	NIKOLAI	If they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this... PINK Revision - 11/12/06 91.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	You tell the Russian desk you saw stars over my heart. OK? Tell them I'm through the door.
M	YURI	They are bound to ask... who did you kill?
M	NIKOLAI	Tell them I only killed myself. And you can tell them I'm going to replace Semyon at the head of the London organization.
M	YURI	What drugs are they giving you? Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.
M	NIKOLAI	I need you to take Semyon out of the picture. I want you to arrest him.
M	YURI	Arrest him for what?
M	NIKOLAI	Rape.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	The girl was fourteen. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 92.
M	YURI	And of course, she will testify...
M	NIKOLAI	She doesn't have to. She's dead.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	But she had Semyon's baby. If you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape. All you need is the baby and some of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons I suggest you take his blood.
M	YURI	You intrigue me.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	If we had never had this conversation they would have sent you home. You could have spent the Spring in the mountains. Riding your bicycle to your office every morning through fields of flowers.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	Why stay?
M	YURI (CONT'D)	You keep in touch. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 93.
M	YURI (CONT'D)	And take care, Mikhail.
M	NIKOLAI	How is Uncle Stepan?
F	ANNA	They're from the morgue. They belonged to someone who died yesterday. I can't believe I'm doing a favor for someone just because he had the decency not to murder a member of my family.
M	NIKOLAI	Hey... wait a minute...
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Is your bike still working OK?
F	ANNA	Yeah. It's OK.
M	NIKOLAI	Did you get in touch with Tatiana's family in Russia?
F	ANNA	No.
M	NIKOLAI	Good.
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	So the baby's still in England.
F	ANNA	She's staying here for good. Why do you care?
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Stepan said you were kind to him. He said you were risking your own life to keep him alive.
M	NIKOLAI	Yeah, and all the thanks I get is a pair of dead man's shoes. I listen to you. *
M	ANNA *	Do you really? *
M	NIKOLAI *	Yes. About Semyon and the baby. * Thank you. * 94A
M	ANNA *	You thank me for that? *
M	NIKOLAI	These things are just marks on the skin, you know?
M	KIRILL	What are you looking at?
F	MARIA	You. What were you and Grandpa shouting about last night?
M	KIRILL	Nothing, baby.
F	MARIA	It sounded like something.
M	KIRILL	Someone I know got hurt and I blamed Grandpa.
F	MARIA	Did you fight each other? I heard banging. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 96.
M	KIRILL	No. It's not a fight if one of you doesn't fight back.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	So, today I do as I am told.
M	KIRILL (CONT'D)	Maria. Go upstairs.
M	SEMYON	You'll have a drink, Yuri...
M	YURI	I don't drink on duty.
M	SEMYON	Sometimes I don't believe you are really Russian.
M	YURI	I've told you, I am half Russian.
M	SEMYON	Then have half a drink. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 97. So what is all this nonsense?
M	YURI	We just need a blood sample.
M	SEMYON	For what?
M	YURI	We can take the sample right now voluntarily or I can get an order from the court. It's up to you.
M	SEMYON	He sits there like a vampire.
M	YURI	What, you are afraid of needles, Semyon?
M	SEMYON	I am afraid of... conspiracies.
M	YURI	I will return tomorrow with a court order.
M	SEMYON	Wait. I've done nothing wrong. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 98.
M	KIRILL	What did they want with you, papa?
M	SEMYON	To poison me.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	They took blood from me with a needle. Probably the same needle they use for all the junkies and whores and blacks and queers.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Now I probably have the fucking queer disease.
M	KIRILL	Why would they want your blood, papa?
M	SEMYON	I don't know.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	Someone is ahead of me. I don't like people ahead of me. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 99.
M	SEMYON (CONT'D)	What the hell did that cocksucker want with my blood?
M	KIRILL	Maybe it's about the baby.
M	SEMYON	What baby?
M	KIRILL	Some bitch was out there saying you were the father of a baby.
M	SEMYON	What are you talking about?
M	KIRILL	It was nothing. Just some bitch...
M	SEMYON	Who?
M	KIRILL	The woman from the hospital. The midwife.
F	ANNA	Sonya! Is someone bathing Christine?
F	SONYA	No. She's in her cot.
F	ANNA	Well she's not. She's not. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 101.
M	KIRILL	Hey, you stupid fucker!! Be quiet baby. Quiet baby. It's OK. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 102.
F	ANNA	What happened to the patient with the knife cuts? The Russian?
M	NURSE	We just discharged him. A couple of minutes ago.
F	ANNA	Where have they taken Christine?!
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	You bastards!! Where will he take her?! Tell me!!
M	NIKOLAI	What are you talking about?!
F	ANNA	Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine. I saw him here! I thought he was coming to see you, but he wasn't, was he?
M	NIKOLAI	You brought your bike? BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 103.
M	NIKOLAI	I'll drive.
F	ANNA	I'll drive.
