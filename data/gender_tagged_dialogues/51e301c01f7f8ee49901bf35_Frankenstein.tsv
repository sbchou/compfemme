M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WALTON	Cut the damn rigging free before we lose the mast! IIIICEBEEEEERG!
M	WALTON	HARD TO PORT!
M	GRIGORI	It's going to ram us.
M	WALTON	It wouldn't dare.
M	WALTON	Put your backs into it!
M	SAILOR #1	What's the use? This godless ice stretches for miles! Would you have us chow our way back to England?
M	WALTON	No. But we'll chop our way to the North Pole if we have to. Inch by bloody inch.
M	GRIGORI	You can't mean to go on! Our journey is ended! The best we can hope for now is to get out of this alive!
M	SAILOR #2	Aye, if the ice ever lets us!
M	WALTON	The ice will break. And when it does, we proceed north... as planned.
M	GRIGORI	At the cost of how many more lives?
M	GRIGORI	There's something out there.
M	WALTON	You five come with me! The rest stay with the ship!
M	GRIGORI	Look.
M	WALTON	Back to the ship.
M	OLD SAILOR	Only the ice to starboard, boy.
M	YOUNG SAILOR	Is it breaking up?
M	OLD SAILOR	Just dancing on the current. It'll freeze even tighter come next wind.
M	SAILOR #4	It was a polar bear. That's what I say.
M	SAILOR #5	Say all you want, but you weren't there. It left human tracks.
M	SAILOR #6	No man could tear those dogs apart.
M	SAILOR #5	No human. We've roused a demon from the ice.
M	SAILOR	Something. In the mist.
M	YOUNG SAILOR	It's the demon! Shoot while you've a chance!
M	WALTON	Dead?
M	GRIGORI	Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
M	WALTON	They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
M	GRIGORI	Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
M	WALTON	Let them try.
M	WALTON	You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
M	VICTOR	I'm... dying.
M	VICTOR	Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
M	WALTON	Are you a physician?
M	VICTOR	How is it you come to be here?
M	WALTON	There's a startling question, coming from you. I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
M	VICTOR	Ah. An explorer.
M	WALTON	Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
M	VICTOR	I heard.
M	WALTON	I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
M	VICTOR	Creature? A... human like creature?
M	WALTON	You know of it?
M	VICTOR	Your men are right to be afraid.
M	WALTON	Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
M	VICTOR	You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
M	WALTON	Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
M	VICTOR	Do you share my madness?
M	WALTON	Madness?
M	VICTOR	We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
M	WALTON	Who are you?
M	VICTOR	My name is Frankenstein...
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Failure has no pride, Victor. You must try again. Yes, Ma'am.
M	FATHER	Mrs. Moritz, would you and your daughter excuse us?
M	MRS. MORITZ	Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along, Justine. Bring your dolly.
M	MOTHER	Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's coming to live with us.
M	FATHER	She has lost her parents to scarlet fever. She is an orphan.
M	MOTHER	You must think of her as your own sister. You must look after her. And be kind to her.
M	ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)	I loved her from the moment that I first saw her.
M	MOTHER	Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by the storm. Go comfort her.
M	VICTOR	Don't cry, Elizabeth.
F	ELIZABETH	Aren't you?
M	VICTOR	We'll build a fort. So the lightning can't get us.
F	ELIZABETH	Are you sure it can't hurt us?
M	VICTOR	Nothing can. Not ever.
M	MRS. MORITZ	You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong...
M	VICTOR	Mrs. Moritz.
M	MRS. MORITZ	...aaand, one-two-three, one-two- three, twirl-two-three...
F	JUSTINE	Mama, can I dance with Victor?
M	MRS. MORITZ	Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a sweeping arc about the room! one- two-three, twirl-two-three.
M	MRS. MORITZ	...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... Excellent! You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen!
M	MRS. MORITZ	Justine. Surely you can maintain better time than that.
F	JUSTINE	Yes, Mama.
F	ELIZABETH	She'll be all right.
M	MRS. MORITZ	You can do nothing here. Wait downstairs.
M	VICTOR	Mother?
M	FATHER	Victor, do as you're told!
M	VICTOR	As a boy, I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree.
M	VICTOR	Father?
F	ELIZABETH	Oh God. The blood.
M	FATHER	I did everything I could.
M	VICTOR	How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
F	ELIZABETH	It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
M	VICTOR	What kind of God is He to will this?
F	ELIZABETH	She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him. I cannot do that alone.
M	VICTOR	God took her from us.
F	ELIZABETH	He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
M	VICTOR	Our brother.
F	JUSTINE	Poor William! What indignant tears!
F	ELIZABETH	There, there... shhh...
F	ELIZABETH	Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy! The world is a dizzying place.
F	ELIZABETH	Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held! He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
F	ELIZABETH	That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
F	JUSTINE	Quite right!
M	VICTOR	Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
F	ELIZABETH	Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
M	VICTOR	Devil take walking, ladies! My brother shall learn to waltz!
F	JUSTINE	Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
F	ELIZABETH	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
F	JUSTINE	One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
M	WILLIE	Auntie Justine, Papa said I could have a sweet.
F	JUSTINE	You can. But not before dinner.
F	JUSTINE	You dance so beautifully together.
F	ELIZABETH	And you look so lovely.
F	JUSTINE	Victor? Spare me one dance?
F	ELIZABETH	Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite out of breath.
M	FATHER	My friends, fatherly pride won't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast.
M	FATHER	To Victor. My son. Who read every medical book in my library by age thirteen... and then re-read them, which seemed excessive even to me. Drape yourself in glory, my boy. Study well. When you return, you return a man of medicine. I will then be honored to call you "colleague."
M	VICTOR	But never your equal.
M	FATHER	No. You'll surpass me.
F	ELIZABETH	Smell the air. Wonderful.
M	VICTOR	Quite a send-off, isn't it?
F	ELIZABETH	Father's so proud.
M	VICTOR	And you?
F	ELIZABETH	Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
M	VICTOR	I'll have to do better than that.
F	ELIZABETH	You will. What do you want, Victor?
M	VICTOR	To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
M	VICTOR	I'm not mad.
F	ELIZABETH	No. Just very earnest. And very dear.
M	VICTOR	I've loved you all my life
F	ELIZABETH	All my life I've known.
M	VICTOR	This feels... incestuous.
F	ELIZABETH	Is that what makes it so delicious?
F	ELIZABETH	Brother and sister still?
M	VICTOR	I wish to be your husband.
F	ELIZABETH	I wish to be your wife.
M	VICTOR	Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
F	ELIZABETH	If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
M	VICTOR	Only you.
F	ELIZABETH	I will be here when you return.
F	ELIZABETH	My head is spinning. I want to give myself to you.
F	ELIZABETH	If we're to be married, must we wait?
M	VICTOR	You make me weak.
F	ELIZABETH	Not as weak as I.
F	ELIZABETH	Our decision. Together.
M	VICTOR	Your decision. For us.
F	ELIZABETH	I give you my soul...
M	VICTOR	...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
F	ELIZABETH	Victor. I love you,
M	VICTOR	Elizabeth. My more than sister.
M	VICTOR	I'll make you so proud, Mother.
M	FATHER	Write to us often.
M	VICTOR	We never finished our dance. Someday we shall.
M	VICTOR	The others will look to you while I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.
M	VICTOR	Elizabeth.
M	FRAU BRACH	No real rooms left. All we've got is attic space. No one ever wants the attic space...
M	VICTOR	This will do nicely.
M	KREMPE	In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse. Any questions?
M	VICTOR	But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
M	KREMPE	Philosophical?
M	VICTOR	Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
M	KREMPE	Paracelsus?
M	VICTOR	Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
M	KREMPE	What is your name?
M	VICTOR	Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.
M	KREMPE	Of Geneva. Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
M	KREMPE	Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. Frankenstein's suggested reading list... thankfully, that would be most of you... would be well advised to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we concern ourselves with immutable reality... ...not the ravings of lunatics and alchemists hundreds of years in their graves. Understood?
M	KREMPE	I am relieved. Are there any relevant questions? Lecture hall dismissed.
M	HENRY	I was just clearing my throat.
M	VICTOR	Very well then.
M	HENRY	You know, you're quite mad.
M	VICTOR	I am not mad.
M	HENRY	As a march hare.
M	VICTOR	Are you having me on?
M	HENRY	Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
M	HENRY	Henry Clerval.
M	VICTOR	Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
M	HENRY	I know. You have a way of making an impression.
M	VICTOR	Do you really think I'm mad?
M	HENRY	Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
M	SCHILLER	If it isn't the sorcerer. Found yourself an apprentice?
M	VICTOR	I'm afraid I rejected his application. He merely dabbles.
M	HENRY	Dilettantes need not apply. What about you? Schiller, isn't it?
M	SCHILLER	Von Schiller. I'm interested in real medicine. Treating the sick.
M	HENRY	Really? I myself find sick people rather revolting. I'm here to secure my degree with a minimum of fuss and hard work that I might settle into a life of privilege treating rich old ladies with gout and dallying with their daughters.
M	SCHILLER	You two disgust me.
M	VICTOR	Rich old ladies and their daughters?
M	HENRY	Can you think of a better reason?
M	VICTOR	Quite a few.
M	HENRY	Do me a favor then... ...keep them to yourself.
M	CLAUDE	It's turning out to be a good year.
F	ELIZABETH	Let's return a tenth of the crop to the tenants. They had a hard winter.
M	CLAUDE	Not even your father would be that generous.
F	ELIZABETH	Then there's no need to tell him, is there?
M	STABLEBOY	Miss! The mail arrived! There's one from Master Victor!
F	ELIZABETH	...and not a day goes by that I do not cherish your faces in my mind's eye or ache to see you all again. Be assured that I am with you in spirit, and you are never far from my thoughts. I remain, as always, your loving and devoted Victor. P.S.
M	WILLIE	What does it say?
F	ELIZABETH	It says, give Willie an extra big hug for me.
M	WILLIAM	Read it again?
M	VICTOR (O.S.)	That's no excuse for being a pompous ass!
M	KREMPE	I'll see you thrown out of this university! I'll go to the dean himself! Take me at my word, Frankenstein! The dean himself!
M	HENRY	The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
M	VICTOR	You're a comfort to me, Henry.
M	HENRY	What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
M	VICTOR	It's a letter to my father.
M	VICTOR	Professor Waldman.
M	WALDMAN	Victor, explain yourself.
M	VICTOR	Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
M	WALDMAN	You have a way of provoking his. I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
M	VICTOR	To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
M	WALDMAN	You disdain accepted wisdom?
M	VICTOR	No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
M	HENRY	Now you've got him started.
M	VICTOR	These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
M	HENRY	...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
M	VICTOR	But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
M	WALDMAN	I understand your frustration. I was young once myself. Walk me home. Something I'd like to show you.
M	WALDMAN	You know for thousands of years the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity? They say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth.
M	WALDMAN	Their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams.
M	VICTOR	Preposterous.
M	WALDMAN	I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous. I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
M	HENRY	It smacks of magic.
M	WALDMAN	Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?
M	WALDMAN	Electricity.
M	VICTOR	It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
M	WALDMAN	Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
M	VICTOR	But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
M	WALDMAN	It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous. Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go. What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
M	VICTOR	I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
M	WALDMAN	Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
M	WALDMAN	"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
M	VICTOR	Why?
M	WALDMAN	Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
M	WALDMAN	Go home, Victor. Write the letter,
M	VICTOR	...and I further wish to extend my sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe for my display. My behavior toward him was both rash and inexcusable.
M	ELIZABETH (O.S.)	I knew held get himself in trouble.
F	JUSTINE	Must've been a terrible row.
F	ELIZABETH	He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous... Fellow..."
M	FATHER	He always was opinionated.
F	ELIZABETH	He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
M	WILLIE	What's that?
M	FATHER	That's where they cut things open and peer about inside.
M	WILLIE	Things? What sort of things?
F	ELIZABETH	It's far too ghoulish for your young ears.
F	ELIZABETH	The point is, your brother is a brilliant student well on his way to becoming the finest-and most compassionate doctor ever...
M	WALDMAN	Re-configure the leads?
M	VICTOR	Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
M	WALDMAN	Worth a try.
M	VICTOR	...and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts I've already named... cerebrum and cerebellum. Any freshmen feeling queasy yet? All of you, from the look of it. We'll resume your torture tomorrow.
M	KREMPE	You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
M	VICTOR	Despite the lack of challenge.
M	WALDMAN	Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
M	VICTOR	The strain was evident.
M	HENRY	Come now, you must take some satisfaction. You've risen to the top of your class. A position of prominence and regard.
M	VICTOR	What keeps me going are my friends.
M	HENRY	Leave off!
M	HENRY	Your Elizabeth must be quite a treasure, Victor ...to justify these prices.
M	HENRY	Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?
M	WALDMAN	I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
M	HENRY	You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
M	WALDMAN	I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
M	HENRY	Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
M	WALDMAN	No. But someday.
M	HENRY	Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
M	VICTOR	Only you would think of that!
M	HENRY	Somebody has to!
M	VICTOR	I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
M	WALDMAN	Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
M	HENRY	And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
M	VICTOR	Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
M	MAN	Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox in it, I hear tell!
M	FAT WOMAN	Pox? They givin' us pox?
M	WALDMAN	No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...
M	FAT WOMAN	Vaca-what?
M	WALDMAN	...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...
M	MAN	I told you there was pox in it!
M	WALDMAN	...no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity, perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is the point of this whole bloody exercise...
M	MAN	You doctors kill people! I don' care what you say, you ain't stickin' it in me!
M	WALDMAN	I most assuredly am! It prevents disease and it's the law! Why am I explaining myself? Somebody restrain this damn fool!
M	HENRY	Professor?
M	WALDMAN	Oh God.
M	HENRY	They just caught the man who did it.
M	VICTOR	He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
M	HENRY	They'll hang him all the same.
M	VICTOR	Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
M	HENRY	Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
M	VICTOR	It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
M	HENRY	You're making a scene!
M	VICTOR	Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
M	HENRY	You can't. Death is God's will!
M	VICTOR	I resent God's monopoly.
M	HENRY	That's blasphemy!
M	VICTOR	Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
M	HENRY	All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
M	VICTOR	No. He had more important work.
M	HENRY	There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
M	VICTOR	Life and death. Why should You alone have the final say?
M	VICTOR	To understand the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death... and examine the process in minutest detail...
M	MAGISTRATE	...his body to be left on public display for a twenty-four hour period, thereafter to be consigned to an unmarked pauper's grave. So the court has spoken.
M	VICTOR	No longer pathetic and useless
M	HENRY	Victor. This has got to stop. Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
M	VICTOR	I've been preoccupied.
M	HENRY	We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
M	VICTOR	That is my concern. I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
M	HENRY	How much longer?
M	VICTOR	Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
M	VICTOR	Materials. That's all they are Tissue to be re-used.
F	ELIZABETH	Nothing. Still nothing.
F	JUSTINE	It's been months. It's not like him.
F	ELIZABETH	Something's wrong. I know it. I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
F	JUSTINE	So have I
F	ELIZABETH	I should go. I should leave today.
F	JUSTINE	Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt. Besides, they're only rumors.
F	ELIZABETH	And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
F	JUSTINE	Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
M	VICTOR	That one.
M	MAN	With this cholera come to town, we'll have plenty more for you.
M	VICTOR	Not optimal. Must use. No time to replace. Body can't wait.
M	ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)	I stitched it together with my own hands...
M	ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)	A patchwork man of my own devising.
M	ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)	It took nutrients like a child receiving milk... blushed like a young girl with the blood I forced through its veins...
M	ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)	...all in preparation.
M	HENRY	God's sake, what is that stench?
M	VICTOR	This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
M	HENRY	Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
M	VICTOR	Yes? And?
M	HENRY	Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
M	VICTOR	You'll be leaving then. Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
M	HENRY	VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO REASON! OUT OF THE WAY!
M	HENRY	Schiller? You're leaving? Where's all that high talk about treating the sick?
M	SCHILLER	To hell with them. And you.
M	VICTOR	Time running out. Rate of decay accelerating. Must strike now... or start again from scratch.
M	VICTOR	Live, you bastard!
M	VICTOR	It's alive. It's alive.
M	VICTOR	What have I done?
M	VICTOR	LET GO OF ME!
M	VICTOR	Massive birth defects. Result is malfunctional and vile. Have chosen to abort.
M	VICTOR	Stay away!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out your deeeaaad!
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	Here! What do you think you're doing?
M	ROUGH MAN	Stupid bastard!
M	VENDOR'S WIFE	BURN HIM! BURN HIM!
M	WORKER #1	Over here!
M	WORKER #2	Oh my God.
M	HENRY	Victor!
M	KREMPE	Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! Lift on three! One, two, three!
M	VICTOR	No... no... I'm not dead... please... Don't put me on the cart! I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!
M	FELIX (O.S.)	Yes, yes, I'm coming...
F	MARIE	Bring Grandfather to the table.
M	HENRY	Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just a sip. I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
M	VICTOR	A... week?
M	HENRY	We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
M	VICTOR	Is that your diagnosis?
M	HENRY	Mine and Professor Krempe's. We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
M	VICTOR	You've been going round-the-clock?
M	HENRY	We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
M	VICTOR	Everything in moderation, Clerval.
M	HENRY	Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
M	HENRY	It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
M	VICTOR	No. They don't.
M	HENRY	Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
M	VICTOR	I want to go home.
M	HENRY	It'll be months before you're well enough. Meantime, your family must be frantic not hearing from you.
M	HENRY	I found these. Some of the postmarks go back nine months. Why don't you open them? And when you've the strength, have the decency to ease their minds with a reply. Soon as the city ends quarantine, I'll even mail it for you. Along with this. It's a beautiful gift. Does her no good lying here.
M	VICTOR	It can't survive.
M	FELIX	Not much to look at. Even less to eat. I don't how we're going to get through the winter with this yield.
F	MARIE	We'll sell another pig at market.
M	FELIX	One less for us.
F	MARIE	We'll make do. We always have.
M	FELIX	I'll see if I can scratch a few more out of the ground.
M	GRANDFATHER	I wish we could thank our benefactor.
M	FELIX	Nothing in this life comes free of cost. I'd like to know who and why.
F	MAGGIE	It's the Good Spirit of the forest.
M	FELIX	Who's been filling your head?
M	GRANDFATHER	It does no harm.
M	FELIX	Oh, I see.
M	THOMAS	Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?
F	MARIE	Of course it is. Now finish your food before it gets cold.
M	GRANDFATHER	Who's there? Felix? Children?
F	MAGGIE	ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.
F	MARIE	Good! And now the next
M	CREATURE	...freh...nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.
F	MARIE	Your hands are bleeding again. Come in. I'll rub liniment.
M	CREATURE	.brread... motherrr... frriend... Treeeeee.
M	FELIX	What is going on here?
M	VICTOR	"...but it's been so long since I've heard from you. Remember the vow we took the night you left? You must be honest with me if your feelings have changed. Answer for the sake of our friendship, and both our future happiness." She wrote that four months ago.
M	HENRY	A woman like that is far too rare to be taken lightly.
M	THOMAS	Ch...uur-ch. Church.

M	THOMAS	...wer. Flower?
F	MARIE	Very good! Maggie. Try the next.
M	CREATURE	Garrr...denn. Garden.
M	THOMAS	Maria! Look! It's snowing!
F	MARIE	Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your death!
M	GRANDFATHER	Let them play. There's plenty of wood for the fire.
M	FELIX	He's right about that.
M	CREATURE	It's snnowwinng.
F	MAGGIE	That one! It's the most beautiful tree I've ever seen!
M	CREATURE	Most beautiful... tree...
F	MAGGIE	Merry Christmas!
M	CREATURE	For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of the... Forr-rest.
F	MARIE	...with particles of heavenly fire, the God of Nature did his soul inspire... and pliant still the ethereal energy which wise Prometheus tempered into paste...
M	CREATURE	Myyy Darrllnng Vic...tor... Willee haaad hisss burrth-dayyy. I wissh... yooo cuud huvv beeen... herre... to sharre ut... withh... ussss...
M	GRANDFATHER	I know you're there. Won't you speak to me?
M	CREATURE	...of sscience... and to c-create... a beinng... in the image of man... assembled ffrrom... the... dead bodieess I have... gatherrred...
M	FELIX	God in heaven.
M	GRANDFATHER	Would you like to sit by the fire?
M	CREATURE	Nice.
M	GRANDFATHER	The music? Or the fire?
M	GRANDFATHER	I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
M	CREATURE	Better that way... for me.
M	GRANDFATHER	Why?
M	CREATURE	I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
M	GRANDFATHER	It can't be as bad as that.
M	CREATURE	Worse.
M	GRANDFATHER	I can see you with my hands. If you'll trust me.
M	GRANDFATHER	You're an outcast.
M	CREATURE	Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
M	GRANDFATHER	Friends? Do they live around here?
M	CREATURE	Yes. Very close
M	GRANDFATHER	Why do you not go to them?
M	CREATURE	I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
M	GRANDFATHER	People can be kinder than you think.
M	CREATURE	I am afraid.
M	GRANDFATHER	Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.
M	CREATURE	I love them... so very much. I want... I want... them to be my ff-family. I II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm- mmuch...
M	CREATURE	Don't let them hate me!
M	GRANDFATHER	Leave him alone!
M	CREATURE	It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!
M	CREATURE	...no.
M	CREATURE	Geneva.
M	HENRY	Our carriage is here.
M	MRS. KREMPE	Such a terrible winter. I'll praise God to see those gates open again.
M	KREMPE	I'll have all your things sent on. They should arrive soon after. It's been a rough time, lad. For us all. But if you'd like to come back and finish out your final term once university re-opens...
M	VICTOR	Thank you, Professor. For everything.
M	KREMPE	Write and let us know you've arrived safely.
M	VICTOR	Take me home, my friend.
M	WILLIAM	HE'S COMING HOME!
M	WILLIAM	Elizabeth! Justine!
M	FATHER	What's all the fuss? Why are you shouting?
M	WILLIAM	He's coming home! Tonight!
F	ELIZABETH	Who? Victor?
M	WILLIAM	That's what I'm telling you!
F	ELIZABETH	Thank God.
M	FATHER	Open it.
M	WILLIAM	It's Victor!
F	JUSTINE	It's beautiful! May I? He looks so handsome.
M	FATHER	What does it say?
F	ELIZABETH	Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.
M	WILLIAM	Married! The two of you?
M	FATHER	Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you were children!
F	JUSTINE	That's wonderful.
M	WILLIAM	Elizabeth? Can I take this to show Peter?
F	ELIZABETH	Willie, it's not a toy for your friends.
M	WILLIAM	I'll take extra special care, I promise! Pete's never seen what Victor looks like! He'll admire it enormously!
F	ELIZABETH	Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few hours.
M	FATHER	Join us for champagne! My son is coming home!
M	CREATURE	Wait! Don't be afraid!
M	MRS. MORITZ	Justine! Pay attention!
F	JUSTINE	Yes, Mother.
F	ELIZABETH	Are you all right?
F	JUSTINE	Fine.
F	JUSTINE	I'll be all right. Really.
M	FATHER	Have you seen Willie?
F	ELIZABETH	Is he not back yet?
M	FATHER	Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
F	ELIZABETH	be out.
M	CLAUDE	Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find him.
F	ELIZABETH	WILLIE!
F	JUSTINE	WILLIE!
M	VICTOR	There! Look!
M	HENRY	Quite a place.
M	VICTOR	Thank you, Henry.
M	HENRY	For what?
M	VICTOR	This. My home. My family. If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
M	VICTOR	Elizabeth?
M	MRS. MORITZ	Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.
M	VICTOR	We'll organize another search now that it's light enough. We'll find her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.
F	ELIZABETH	What is Father's outlook?
M	HENRY	I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet and proper care he may eventually regain some or most of his strength.
F	ELIZABETH	Thank you, Henry.
M	POLICEMAN #1	Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended the murderer. Not five miles from here, hiding in a barn.
M	VICTOR	Who is it?
M	POLICEMAN #2	It's very unsettling, sir. And quite strange. Perhaps you'd better come with us.
M	FEMALE VOICE	Victor?
F	JUSTINE	Victor! It's you! Thank God!
F	JUSTINE	Is it true? What they say about Willie? Is it true?
M	VICTOR	Yes.
F	JUSTINE	Willie. My poor little angel. Victor! They think I did it!
M	VICTOR	Did you?
F	JUSTINE	I don't believe... I am in need of your comfort... anymore.
M	VICTOR	Did you, Justine?
F	JUSTINE	Get out!
M	KITCHEN MAID	I found her sobbing her eyes out. Poor thing, I said, what's all this? And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor. How she'd always loved him, and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth.
M	KITCHEN MAID	She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent. How she wished it was hers. She swore me never to tell a soul. That was before the boy went missing, a'course.
M	VICTOR	I always viewed her with brotherly affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me.
M	PROSECUTOR	Rejection can be a powerful wound. People have been known to do uncanny things.
M	VICTOR	But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved?
M	VICTOR	It's hard to believe.
F	ELIZABETH	Justine and I grew up as sisters. I know her better than anybody.
M	DEFENDING COUNSEL	Do you think it possible she committed this crime?
F	ELIZABETH	William was as much her child as mine. We were both mother to him. I believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body.
M	DEFENDING COUNSEL	Then you consider the charge without merit.
F	ELIZABETH	I consider the charge imbecilic.
F	JUSTINE	Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
M	PROSECUTOR	And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
F	JUSTINE	I have always loved him.
M	PROSECUTOR	Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
F	JUSTINE	Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
M	PROSECUTOR	So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this. The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted. How did it come to be in your possession?
F	JUSTINE	I have no knowledge of that.
M	CREATURE	Frankenstein.
M	VICTOR	Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!
M	VICTOR	Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.
M	VICTOR	My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
F	ELIZABETH	But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
M	VICTOR	I've no choice
F	ELIZABETH	If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
M	VICTOR	They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
F	ELIZABETH	Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
M	VICTOR	I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
M	VICTOR	WHERE ARE YOU?
M	CREATURE	Come warm yourself if you like.
M	VICTOR	You speak.
M	CREATURE	Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
M	VICTOR	How did you find me?
M	CREATURE	The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
M	VICTOR	Kill me and have done with it.
M	CREATURE	Kill you? Hardly that.
M	VICTOR	Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
M	CREATURE	More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me? What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice. Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
M	VICTOR	Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
M	CREATURE	Your crime... as well as mine.
M	VICTOR	How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
M	CREATURE	Evil? Do you believe in evil?
M	VICTOR	I see it before me.
M	CREATURE	I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
M	CREATURE	Were the dying cries of your brother music in my ears?
M	CREATURE	I took him by the throat with one hand... lifted him off the ground. And slowly crushed his neck. That poor, innocent child died in my grip... because all I could see was your face... and all I could feel was my rage. And when I let him go, he fluttered to the grass like a sparrow...
M	CREATURE	Later, when they were searching, I followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods...
M	CREATURE (V.O.)	She was so lovely. I longed to touch her... and seek her sympathy...
M	CREATURE (V.O.)	...but I simply returned the object which had triggered my crime, hoping in some small way to atone...
M	CREATURE	You gave me these emotions, but you didn't tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead. Because of us.
M	CREATURE	Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
M	VICTOR	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
M	CREATURE	What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
M	VICTOR	Materials. Nothing more.
M	CREATURE	You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
M	CREATURE	In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
M	VICTOR	Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
M	CREATURE	Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? Who am I?
M	VICTOR	I don't know.
M	CREATURE	Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
M	VICTOR	What can I do?
M	CREATURE	There is something I want. A friend.
M	VICTOR	Friend?
M	CREATURE	A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
M	VICTOR	Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
M	CREATURE	I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours. You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
M	VICTOR	And if I consent?
M	CREATURE	We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together. No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
M	CREATURE	Soon?
M	VICTOR	Yes. I want this over and done with.
M	CREATURE	I'll be waiting. And watching.
F	ELIZABETH	I thought I'd never see you again!
M	VICTOR	I'm all right. I'm safe,
M	HENRY	What happened up there?
M	VICTOR	I didn't find what I was looking for.
M	CLAUDE	What did you find?
M	CLAUDE	These have been fired.
M	VICTOR	At shadows. My nerves got the better of me.
F	ELIZABETH	What sort of task?
M	VICTOR	It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
F	ELIZABETH	What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
M	VICTOR	So do I.
F	ELIZABETH	We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
M	VICTOR	A month at most, that's all I ask. Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake. You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
M	VICTOR	You must regain your strength to preside at our wedding... and spoil your grandchildren later on. These are duties you cannot shirk.
M	VICTOR	We're all safe now. I promise
M	VICTOR	God forgive me. I prayed never to see these again...
M	HENRY	Whatever they are.
M	HENRY	I won't bother asking what or why. You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just hope you know what you're doing... ...because if this is a repeat of Ingolstadt, I won't be around to pick up the pieces.
M	CREATURE	I want her.
M	VICTOR	Why... her?
M	CREATURE	Her body pleases me.
M	CREATURE	Materials, remember? Nothing more. Your words.
M	VICTOR	My words.
M	VICTOR	The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. We'll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. They'll have to be replaced. The fresher the better.
M	PROSTITUTE	Want some yourself? Or just like to watch? What do you say, lover? I can make it good for you.
M	CREATURE	I know you can.
M	VICTOR	What is this?
M	CREATURE	A brain. Extremities.
M	VICTOR	This was not taken from a grave.
M	CREATURE	What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
M	VICTOR	No. I draw the line.
M	CREATURE	You will honor your promise to me!
M	VICTOR	I will not! Kill me now!
M	CREATURE	That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
M	VICTOR	No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
F	ELIZABETH	Why the change? What about your work?
M	VICTOR	It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
F	ELIZABETH	It is
M	VICTOR	We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
F	ELIZABETH	Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
M	VICTOR	Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
F	ELIZABETH	Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
M	VICTOR	I do. But you must trust me for now.
M	FATHER	This is not... the grand wedding... I had hoped to give you...
M	PRIEST	We gather now in the sight of God to witness this man and woman bond their lives in matrimonial vow.
M	VICTOR	Be especially on your guard. Stay cautious to a fault.
M	STABLE HAND	Who is this man, sir? How shall we know him?
M	VICTOR	He is huge and deformed... and quite insane.
M	CLAUDE	He killed Master William and sent Justine Moritz to the noose! No hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard on sight!
M	VICTOR	Are you sure you'll be all right?
M	HENRY	Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
M	VICTOR	I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
M	HENRY	Only if you'll tell me who he is.
M	VICTOR	I owe you that. Done.
M	FATHER	Victor?
M	PRIEST	You're the Devil himself.
M	CREATURE	Yes, and I've come to snatch your soul... ...unless you tell me where they've gone.
M	CLAUDE	That was the last ferry. There's nothing else till morning.
M	VICTOR	Damn it
M	CLAUDE	We'll ride on ahead and secure you lodging for the night.
M	VICTOR	Make sure you keep your pistols dry
M	GUARD #2	They're dry enough. And if they fail, we've others. And if those fail... ...we can always gut the bastard.
M	CLAUDE	Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. Now why don't you go upstairs to your wife? It's not often a man has his wedding night.
F	ELIZABETH	You're soaking.
F	ELIZABETH	Brother and sister no more.
M	VICTOR	Now husband and wife.
M	VICTOR	I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
F	ELIZABETH	I have been waiting for this ever since.
F	ELIZABETH	Victor!
M	VICTOR	Open this door for no-one!
M	GUARD #2	I saw him in a flash of lightning! He vanished toward the lake!
M	CLAUDE	Get after him!
M	CREATURE	Don't bother to scream.
M	GUARD #3	We lost him.
M	GUARD #4	Why are those open?
M	VICTOR	Elizabeth.
F	ELIZABETH	You don't want to hurt me.
M	CREATURE	You're more lovely than I could ever have imagined.
M	VICTOR	ELIZABETH!
M	CREATURE	I keep my promises.
M	VICTOR	Oh God... he took her heart... he took her heart from me...
M	VICTOR	Live.
M	VICTOR	Say my name.
M	VICTOR	Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you remember. Say my name.
M	VICTOR	You must. You must.
M	VICTOR	Say my name. Say you remember.
M	VICTOR	Yes. I'll help you remember.
M	VICTOR	...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.
M	CREATURE	She's beautiful.
M	VICTOR	She's not for you.
M	CREATURE	I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
M	VICTOR	Elizabeth, no! Say my name.
F	ELIZABETH	Vic... tor?
M	CREATURE	...no...
M	CREATURE	GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
M	VICTOR	SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
M	VICTOR	NO!
M	VICTOR	You killed her! You killed her!
M	CREATURE	We killed her.
M	HENRY	Victor.
M	VICTOR	All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
M	HENRY	Let it go.
M	VICTOR	You should have been my father's son. He would have been so proud.
M	HENRY	VICTOR! COME BACK!
M	ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)	I followed his trail north... always north... and always one step behind... never stopping... driven by my fires of rage... and revenge...
M	VICTOR	A year now I've followed him. Perhaps more. Only to arrive at this place. Tired. So very tired. I never did find... whatever it was... I was looking for... and neither will you, my friend. Value life above ambition... or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers... as they have in mine. See your loved ones again. I cannot.
M	WALTON	Rest now.
M	WALTON	A warming wind.
M	GRIGORI	This ice will break yet. How's our guest?
M	WALTON	He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
M	GRIGORI	Aye, Captain.
M	WALTON	Who are you?
M	CREATURE	He never gave me a name.
M	CREATURE	You were with him at the end.
M	WALTON	Yes.
M	CREATURE	I was watching.
M	CREATURE	I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
M	WALTON	What is that to you? Evil as you are.
M	CREATURE	I am as he made me. In his own image.
M	WALTON	You drove him to his torment.
M	CREATURE	And he drove me to mine.
M	WALTON	Then why weep for him?
M	CREATURE	Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
M	CREATURE	Could we ever have forgiven?
M	CREATURE	I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
M	WALTON	What kindness?
M	CREATURE	Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
M	PILOT	Christ.
M	WALTON	It has a right to bear witness.
M	WALTON	Stand fast. All of you.
M	OLD SAILOR	THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!
M	GRIGORI	TORCH THE DAMN THING!
M	WALTON	BACK TO THE SHIP!
M	GRIGORI	LEAVE IT!
M	WALTON	GRIGORI!
M	WALTON	GRIGORI!
M	WALTON	SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!
M	WALTON	Swim. Don't do it... FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!
M	CREATURE	For God's sake... I will.
M	WALTON	Home
M	THE END
