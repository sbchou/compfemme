M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff of legend.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
M	GANG BOSS	I see you like to CHEW! Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And then, he spoke.
M	WARRIOR	Enough talk. Let's FIGHT! SHASHABOOEY!
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness.
M	NINJA CAT	MY EYES!
M	GATOR	HE'S TOO AWESOME!
M	SMITTEN BUNNY	And ATTRACTIVE!
M	GRATEFUL BUNNY	How can we repay you??
M	WARRIOR	There is no charge for awesomeness, or attractiveness.
M	WARRIOR	KABLOOEY!
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	It mattered not how many foes he faced. They were no match for his bodacity.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Never before had a panda been so feared... and so loved. Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master.
M	MONKEY	We should hang out.
M	WARRIOR	Agreed.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	But hanging out would have to wait. `Cause when you're facing the ten thousand demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters. And that's--
M	MONKEY	Po! Get up!
F	TIGRESS	You'll be late for work!
M	PO	Whu?
M	PO'S DAD (O.S.)	Po! Get up!
M	PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Po! What are you doing up there?
M	PO	Uh, nothing!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress! Rowrrrr...
M	PO'S DAD (O.S.)	Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
M	PO	Coming!
M	PO	Sorry, Dad.
M	PO'S DAD	Sorry doesn't make the noodles. What were you doing up there? All that noise.
M	PO	Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy dream.
M	PO'S DAD	About what?
M	PO	Huh?
M	PO'S DAD	The dream. What were you dreaming about?
M	PO	What was I... eh, I was dreaming about uh... heh...
M	PO (CONT'D)	Noodles.
M	PO'S DAD	Noodles. You were really dreaming about noodles?
M	PO	Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
M	PO (CONT'D)	Careful, that soup is... sharp!
M	PO'S DAD	Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream!
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	You don't know how long I have been waiting for this moment.
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	This is a sign, Po!
M	PO	Uh...a sign of what?
M	PO'S DAD	You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient Soup." And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant, just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong.
M	PO	Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.
M	PO'S DAD	No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
M	PO	But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno, want to do something else? Something besides noodles?
M	PO'S DAD	Actually... When I was young and crazy...
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
M	PO	So why didn't you?!
M	PO'S DAD	Oh, because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine, me making tofu? No. We all have our place in this world. Mine is here. And yours is--
M	PO	I know. Is here.
M	PO'S DAD	No, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve.
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	Service with a smile!
M	SHIFU	Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Tigress, you need more ferocity. Monkey, greater speed. Crane - height. Viper - subtlety. Mantis--
M	ZENG	Master Shifu!
M	SHIFU	What?!
M	ZENG	Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
M	SHIFU	Master Oogway? You summoned me.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Is something wrong?
M	OOGWAY	Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
M	SHIFU	So... nothing's wrong?
M	OOGWAY	Well, I didn't say that.
M	SHIFU	You were saying?
M	OOGWAY	I have had a vision... Tai Lung will return.
M	SHIFU	That is impossible. He is in prison.
M	OOGWAY	Nothing is impossible.
M	SHIFU	Zeng! Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. Double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
M	ZENG	Yes, Master Shifu.
M	OOGWAY	One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
M	SHIFU	We have to do something. We can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
M	OOGWAY	Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.
M	SHIFU	The Dragon Scroll...
M	OOGWAY	It is time.
M	SHIFU	But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become...the Dragon Warrior?!
M	OOGWAY	I don't know.
M	PO	Oop...sorry.
M	ANGRY PATRON	Hey! Watch it, Po!
M	PO	Sorry. Suck it up.
M	DISGUSTED PATRON	Ugh!
M	PO	Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons. What?! Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today! Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace!
M	PO (CONT'D)	One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll! We've been waiting a thousand years for this! Just take the bowl!
M	PO (CONT'D)	This is the greatest day in Kung Fu history! Don't worry about it, just go!
M	PO'S DAD	Po! Where are you going?
M	PO	To the...Jade Palace?
M	PO'S DAD	But you're forgetting your noodle cart! The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
M	PO	Selling noodles? But Dad, you know, I was kinda thinking maybe I...
M	PO'S DAD	Yeah?
M	PO	I was kinda thinking maybe I...
M	PO'S DAD	Uh huh?
M	PO	...Could also sell the bean buns. They are about to go bad.
M	PO'S DAD	That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign!
M	PO	Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.
M	BUNNY FAN #1	Yippee!
M	BUNNY FAN #2	I'm a Kung Fu warrior! Me too!
M	PO	Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost there...
M	PO (CONT'D)	What? No! Oh No!
M	KG SHAW	Sorry, Po.
M	JR SHAW	We'll bring you back a souvenir.
M	PO	No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
M	SHIFU	It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway?
M	OOGWAY	Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready?
M	SHIFU	Yes, Master Oogway.
M	OOGWAY	Now know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the Valley, but also to you.
M	ANNOUNCER	Let the tournament begin!
M	PO	Yeah!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Hey! Open the door!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Let me in!
M	SHIFU	Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
M	PO	The Furious Five!
M	SHIFU	Warriors prepare!
M	PO	Peeky-hole!
M	SHIFU	Ready for battle!
M	PO	Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of Fire!
M	PIG FAN	Whoa! Look at that.
M	PO	Hey, get out of the way! Ow...
M	SHIFU	And finally...Master Tigress!
M	SHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D)	And believe me citizens, you have not seen anything yet!
M	PO	I KNOW!! Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death!
M	OOGWAY	I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
M	SHIFU	Citizens of the Valley of Peace! Master Oogway will now choose... the Dragon Warrior!
M	PO	Huh? Oh no! Wait!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Yeah! Po?!
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	What are you doing?
M	PO	What does it look like I'm doing? Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
M	PO'S DAD	But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream.
M	PO	I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad! I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-
M	PO'S DAD	Come on, son. Let's get back to work.
M	PO	Okay.
M	PO'S DAD	Oh! Come back!
M	CROWD	Oooh! Aaahh!
M	PO	Uh oh...
M	PO	What's going on? Where...uh? What are you pointing--? Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
M	OOGWAY	How interesting.
F	TIGRESS	Master, are you pointing at...me?
M	OOGWAY	Him.
M	PO	Who--?
M	OOGWAY	You.
M	PO	Me?
M	OOGWAY	The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
M	PO	What?
M	FURIOUS FIVE	What??
M	SHIFU	What??? WHAT????
M	SHIFU	Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Master Oogway, wait! That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem. You were about to point at Tigress. That thing fell in front of her. That was just an accident!
M	OOGWAY	There are no accidents.
F	TIGRESS	Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.
M	SHIFU	No. If the panda has not quit by morning, then I will have failed you.
M	ZENG	Wait wait wait! I bring a message from Master Shifu.
M	COMMANDER	What?!?! "Double the guard?! Extra precautions?! Your prison may not be adequate!"
M	COMMANDER (CONT'D)	You doubt my prison's security?
M	ZENG	Absolutely not. Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
M	COMMANDER	I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
M	COMMANDER	Escape from Chogun Prison is impossible!
M	ZENG	Whoa.
M	COMMANDER	Impressive, isn't it?
M	ZENG	Yes, very impressive. It's VERY impressive.
M	COMMANDER	One way in, one way out, one thousand guards, and one prisoner.
M	ZENG	Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung...
M	COMMANDER	Take us down.
M	ZENG	What are you doing?!
M	ZENG (CONT'D)	Oh my...
M	COMMANDER	Behold, Tai Lung.
M	ZENG	I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right here.
M	COMMANDER	It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
M	ZENG	Oof!
M	COMMANDER	Crossbows! At the ready!
M	ZENG	Crossbows?!
M	COMMANDER	Hey, tough guy, did you hear? Oogway's finally gonna give someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not gonna be you!
M	ZENG	What are you doing?! Don't get him mad.
M	COMMANDER	What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.
M	COMMANDER (CONT'D)	Awww. Did I step on the witty kitty's tail? Awww.
M	ZENG	I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing to worry about.
M	COMMANDER	No, he doesn't.
M	ZENG	Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we please go now?
M	CROWD	Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
M	PO	Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh... Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors. No way! Would you look at this place!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With authentic battle damage!
M	PO (CONT'D)	The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW! The Invisible Trident of Destiny!?
M	PO (CONT'D)	I've only seen paintings of that painting...
M	PO (CONT'D)	Nooo! Ohhhh!
M	PO (CONT'D)	The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors! Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army. Hellooo?
M	SHIFU	Have you finished sight-seeing?
M	PO	Sorry. I should've come to see you first.
M	SHIFU	My patience is wearing thin.
M	PO	Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
M	SHIFU	Would you turn around?
M	PO	Sure. Hey, how's it going?
M	PO (CONT'D)	Now how do you get five thousand-- Master Shifu!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna fix it. Do you have some glue?
M	PO (CONT'D)	Ow! Ooh. Splinter.
M	SHIFU	So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior. Hmmm?
M	PO	Uh...I guess so?
M	SHIFU	Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
M	PO	Whoa. So how does this work? You have a ladder or trampoline or...?
M	SHIFU	You think it's that easy? That I am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power?
M	PO	No, I...
M	SHIFU	One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you.
M	PO	Someone like me?
M	SHIFU	Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Flabby arms...
M	PO	Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
M	SHIFU	And this ridiculous belly.
M	PO	Hey...
M	SHIFU	--and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
M	PO	Now wait a minute. That's a little uncalled-for.
M	SHIFU	Don't stand that close...I can smell your breath.
M	PO	Listen...Oogway said that I was the- The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
M	SHIFU	Oh, you know this hold?
M	PO	DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna sty-- YES.
M	SHIFU	Oh, then you must know what happens when I flex my pinky.
M	PO	No no no!
M	SHIFU	You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards...
M	PO	Okay! Okay! Take it easy...
M	SHIFU	Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't. Are we clear?
M	PO	Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We are so clear.
M	SHIFU	Good. I can't wait to get started.
M	SHIFU	Let's begin.
M	PO	Wait wait wait...What? Now?
M	SHIFU	Yes...now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
M	PO	Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
M	SHIFU	Well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we?
M	PO	Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
M	SHIFU	And what level is that?
M	PO	Well, ya know...I'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero.
M	SHIFU	There is no such thing as level zero.
M	PO	Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
M	SHIFU	That? We use that for training children. And for propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist...
M	PO	Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.
M	SHIFU	Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
M	PO	Um, are they gonna watch? Or should I just wait until they get back to work or something...
M	SHIFU	Hit it.
M	PO	Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting... So my kung fu might not be as good as later on.
M	SHIFU	Just hit it.
M	PO	Alright. Whatcha got? You got nothing cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel the thunder. I'm comin' at him with the crazy feet. Whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You never seen bear style, you only seen praying Mantis! OR... I could come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm comin' at ya snikity-snake.
M	SHIFU	Would you hit it!
M	PO	Alright...alright.
M	SHIFU	Why don't you try again? A little harder...
M	PO	How's tha--
M	PO (CONT'D)	Ow, that hurts.
M	SHIFU	This'll be easier than I thought.
M	PO	Feeling a little nauseous.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think I... Oooohoohoo...my tenders. How did I do?
M	SHIFU	There is now a level zero.
M	MANTIS	There's no words.
M	CRANE	No denying that.
F	VIPER	I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's just gonna get himself killed.
M	CRANE	He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire.
M	MANTIS	When he walks, the very ground shakes!
F	TIGRESS	One would think that Master Oogway would choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu.
M	CRANE	Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
M	MONKEY	Or even see his toes.
M	PO	Okay.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Great. Oh hey...hi. You're up.
M	CRANE	Am now.
M	PO	I was just uh... Some day huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Your biceps sore?
M	CRANE	Um...I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.
M	PO	Yeah yeah yeah, of course.
M	CRANE	Okay, thanks.
M	PO	It's just...I'm such a big fan.
M	CRANE	Oop.
M	PO	You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just... HI-YAH!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Ooo, sorry about that.
M	CRANE	Look, you don't belong here.
M	PO	I know. I know. You're right. I just - my whole life I've dreamed of-
M	CRANE	No no no... I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Crane.
M	PO	Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you want to get to sleep.
M	CRANE	Yeah.
M	PO	I'm keepin' you up. We got big things tomorrow. Alright. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Okay. Bye bye. What was that?
M	CRANE	I didn't say anything.
M	PO	Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep well.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Seemed a little bit awkward.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake you. Just uh...
F	TIGRESS	You don't belong here.
M	PO	Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is your room.
F	TIGRESS	I mean...you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to Kung Fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning.
M	PO	Big fan...
M	OOGWAY	I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
M	PO	Is that what this is? I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
M	OOGWAY	I understand. You eat when you are upset.
M	PO	Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset?
M	OOGWAY	So why are you upset?
M	PO	I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of China, in the history of sucking.
M	OOGWAY	Probably.
M	PO	And the Five... man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me.
M	OOGWAY	Totally.
M	PO	How's Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? I mean, I'm not like The Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those... ...thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
M	OOGWAY	Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles. You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There is a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.
M	ZENG	What's happening?!
M	COMMANDER	Fire Crossbows!
M	ZENG	Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu!
M	COMMANDER	You're not going anywhere. And neither is he.
M	ZENG	Let go of me!
M	COMMANDER	Bring it up!
M	RHINO GUARD #1	Wait! Bring it back!
M	ZENG	He's coming this way!
M	COMMANDER	He won't get far. Archers!
M	ZENG	We're dead. So very, very dead.
M	COMMANDER	Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
M	ZENG	Can we run now?
M	COMMANDER	Yes.
M	ZENG	Nuuu... Urggg... URRK!
M	TAI LUNG	I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I had been forgotten. Fly back there and tell them...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
M	FURIOUS FIVE	Good morning master!
M	SHIFU	Panda! Panda, wake up!
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Hmm. He's quit.
F	VIPER	What do we do now, Master? With the panda gone, who will be the Dragon Warrior?
M	SHIFU	All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
M	SHIFU	What are you doing here?!
M	PO	Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I thought I'd warm up a little.
M	SHIFU	You're stuck.
M	PO	Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck... Yeah, I'm stuck.
M	SHIFU	Help him.
M	CRANE	Oh dear.
M	PO	Maybe on three. One. Two-
M	PO (CONT'D)	Threeeee. Thank you.
M	CRANE	Don't mention it.
M	PO	No really, I appreci--
M	CRANE	--EVER.
M	SHIFU	You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
M	PO	Yeah, excellent!
M	SHIFU	Let's get started.
F	VIPER	Are you ready?
M	PO	I was born ready-- Eaghhh...
F	VIPER	I'm sorry, brother! I thought you said you were ready!
M	PO	That was awesome! Let's go again.
M	SHIFU	I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more! Your next opponent... will be me.
M	PO	Alright! Let's go!
M	SHIFU	Step forth.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it.
M	PO	Oh, yeah!
M	SHIFU	To take his strength and use it against him.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	--until he finally falls, or quits.
M	PO	But a real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master, I will never quit!
F	TIGRESS	If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
M	MONKEY	But he will.
F	VIPER	He's not gonna quit, is he?
M	MANTIS	He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll tell ya that. Aaaoo...whoohoo...EEEee...hee- hee... I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
M	MANTIS	Trust me, it will. It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this--
M	PO	Fat?
M	MANTIS	Fur, I was gonna say fur.
M	PO	Sure you were.
M	MANTIS	Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? I mean -- look at me.
M	MANTIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)	I'm over here.
M	PO	Ow!
F	VIPER	Maybe you should take a look at this again.
M	MANTIS	Oh! Okay.
M	PO	Ow! Don't... Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
M	MANTIS	I know he can seem kind of heartless--
M	MANTIS (CONT'D)	But, ya know, he wasn't always like that.
F	VIPER	According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
M	PO	No.
M	MANTIS	Yes.
F	VIPER	But that was before...
M	PO	Before what?
F	TIGRESS	Before Tai Lung.
M	CRANE	Uh yeah, we're not really supposed to talk about him.
F	TIGRESS	Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
M	PO	Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.
M	PO (CONT'D)	He was a student, the first ever to master the thousand...
M	PO (CONT'D)	...scrolls of... kung fu... and... then he turned bad... and now he's in jail.
F	TIGRESS	He wasn't just a student.
M	TIGRESS (V.O.)	Shifu found him as a cub. And he raised him as a son. ...and when the boy showed talent in Kung Fu...
M	TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	...Shifu trained him.
M	TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
M	TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It was never enough for Tai Lung. He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley. He tried to take the scroll by force. And Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
M	TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	But how could he?
M	TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd never loved anyone before... ...or since.
F	TIGRESS	And now he has a chance to make things right, to train the true Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with you: a big, fat panda who treats it like a joke.
M	PO	Doieeeee...
F	TIGRESS	Oh! That is it!
M	MANTIS	Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
M	MANTIS (CONT'D)	And may have also stopped his heart.
M	SHIFU	Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Would whoever is making that flapping sound, quiet down! Inner...
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now.
M	ZENG	Uh...
M	SHIFU	Master! Master!
M	OOGWAY	Hmmm?
M	SHIFU	I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
M	OOGWAY	Ah, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad.
M	SHIFU	Master, your vision...your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way!
M	OOGWAY	That is bad news...
M	OOGWAY (CONT'D)	...If you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
M	SHIFU	The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. He wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident!
M	OOGWAY	There are no accidents.
M	SHIFU	Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice.
M	OOGWAY	Well, that was no accident either.
M	SHIFU	Thrice.
M	OOGWAY	My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control.
M	SHIFU	Illusion?
M	OOGWAY	Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time.
M	SHIFU	But there are things we can control.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	I can control when the fruit will fall. And I can control-- --where to plant the seed. That is no illusion, Master. Ah, yes. But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple, or an orange... but you will get a peach.
M	SHIFU	But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
M	OOGWAY	Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it, to nurture it. To believe in it.
M	SHIFU	But how? How? I need your help, Master.
M	OOGWAY	No, you just need to believe. Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe.
M	SHIFU	I... I will try.
M	OOGWAY	Good. My time has come. You must continue your journey without me.
M	SHIFU	What... what are you..?
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Master, you can't leave me!
M	OOGWAY	You must believe.
M	SHIFU	Master! ...So I'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province...
M	PO	...but you're a lousy tipper.
M	CRANE	Really? So... how'd you get out of there alive?
M	PO	I mean, I didn't actually say that, but I thought it... in my mind.
M	PO (CONT'D)	If he... could read my mind, he'd have been like, "What?" Order up! Hope you like it.
M	MANTIS	This is really good.
M	PO	No, c'mon. You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
F	VIPER	What are you talking about? This is amazing.
M	CRANE	Wow, you're a really good cook.
M	MANTIS	I wish my mouth was bigger.
M	MONKEY	Tigress, you gotta try this.
F	TIGRESS	It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe.
M	PO	I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice.
M	PO (CONT'D)	What?
M	MANTIS	Oh, nothing... Master Shifu!
M	PO	You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth!
M	PO (CONT'D)	What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Work hard, Panda. And maybe, someday... you will have ears like mine.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
M	MONKEY	It's Shifu.
M	PO	Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
M	PO (CONT'D)	Ooh! Master Shifu!
M	SHIFU	You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children!
M	PO	What?
M	SHIFU	He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him.
M	PO	And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna stop Tai... What? You're serious? And I have to-- uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He did it before, he'll do it again.
M	SHIFU	Oogway cannot, not anymore.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
F	TIGRESS	The panda?
M	SHIFU	Yes, the panda!
F	TIGRESS	Master, please. Let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
M	SHIFU	No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his. Where'd he go?
M	SHIFU	You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits!
M	PO	Watch me!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Come on! How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.
M	SHIFU	You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior!
M	PO	Ow! You don't believe that! You never believed that! From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me.
M	SHIFU	Yes. I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
M	PO	You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
M	SHIFU	Then why didn't you quit? You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed.
M	PO	Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt. But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.
M	PO (CONT'D)	I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me, could make me... not me, it was you. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China.
M	SHIFU	But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
M	PO	C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here right now. And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this... ...into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? How?!
M	SHIFU	I don't know!!! I don't know.
M	PO	That's what I thought.
F	TIGRESS	This is what you trained me for.
F	VIPER	Tigress!
F	TIGRESS	Don't try and stop me!
F	VIPER	We're not trying to stop you!
F	TIGRESS	What?
F	VIPER	We're coming with you!
M	PO	What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
M	SHIFU	Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
M	PO	Don't tell Monkey.
M	SHIFU	Look at you.
M	PO	Yeah, I know. I disgust you.
M	SHIFU	No no, I mean... how did you get up there?
M	PO	I don't know. I guess I-- I don't know. I was getting a cookie...
M	SHIFU	And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split.
M	PO	No, this... this is just an accident.
M	SHIFU	There are no accidents. Come with me.
M	PO	I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y, but could you at least tell me where we're going?
M	PO	You dragged me all the way out here for a bath?!
M	SHIFU	Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears.
M	PO	The pool of...
M	SHIFU	This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace of Kung Fu. Do you want to learn Kung Fu?
M	PO	Yeah...
M	SHIFU	Then I am your master!
M	PO	Okay!
M	SHIFU	Don't cry.
M	PO	Okay.
M	SHIFU	When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate...you stink. But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you is with this!
M	PO	Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.
M	SHIFU	Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin.
M	SHIFU	After you, panda.
M	PO	Just like that? No situps? No ten mile hike?
M	SHIFU	I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Enjoy.
M	PO	Hey!
M	SHIFU	I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
M	PO	Hey!
M	SHIFU	You are free to eat!
M	PO	Am I?
M	SHIFU	Are you?!
M	PO	I'm not hungry... master.
F	TIGRESS	Cut it!
M	TAI LUNG	Where's the Dragon Warrior?
F	TIGRESS	How do you know you're not looking at her?
M	TAI LUNG	You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
M	TAI LUNG (CONT'D)	I heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire, that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
M	MONKEY	Po?
M	TAI LUNG	So that is his name -- Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
M	MONKEY	We've got this. Help her!
F	VIPER	Monkey!
M	MANTIS	Go! Ack! What was I thinking?!
F	TIGRESS	Mantis!
M	TIGRESS (CONT'D)	Now!
M	TAI LUNG	Shifu taught you well...
M	TAI LUNG (CONT'D)	But he didn't teach you everything.
M	SHIFU	You have done well, Panda.
M	PO	Done well? Done well?! I've done awesome!
M	SHIFU	The mark of a true hero is humility!
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	But yes...you have done awesome.
M	PO	Huh? Guys? Guys!
M	PO (CONT'D)	They're dead? No, they're breathing! They're asleep?! No, their eyes are open.
M	CRANE	We were no match for his nerve attack.
M	SHIFU	He has gotten stronger.
M	PO	Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
M	MONKEY	He's too fast!
M	MONKEY (CONT'D)	Sorry, Po.
F	TIGRESS	I thought we could stop him.
M	SHIFU	He could have killed you.
M	MANTIS	Why didn't he?
M	SHIFU	So you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work!
M	PO	Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared.
M	SHIFU	You can defeat him, panda.
M	PO	Are you kidding? If they can't-- They're five masters. I'm just one me.
M	SHIFU	But you will have the one thing that no one else does.
M	PO	You really believe I'm ready?
M	SHIFU	You are, Po. Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is yours.
M	PO	Wait, what happens when I read it?
M	SHIFU	No one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat.
M	PO	Whoa! Really? That's cool.
M	SHIFU	Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you.
M	PO	Wow! Can I punch through walls? Can I do a quadruple back flip? Will I have invisibility--
M	SHIFU	Focus. Focus.
M	PO	Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
M	SHIFU	Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become... the Dragon Warrior!
M	PO	Whooaa!!!
M	PO (CONT'D)	It's impossible to open.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Come on baby. Come on now...
M	PO (CONT'D)	Thank you. I probably loosened it up for you though... Okay, here goes. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
M	PO (CONT'D)	It's blank!
M	SHIFU	What?
M	PO	Here! Look!
M	SHIFU	No! I am forbidden to look upon-- Blank? I don't...I don't understand.
M	PO	Okay. So like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all?
M	SHIFU	No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
M	PO	Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
F	TIGRESS	But who will stop Tai Lung?
M	CRANE	He'll destroy everything...and everyone.
M	SHIFU	No, evacuate the Valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
F	TIGRESS	What about you master?
M	SHIFU	I will fight him.
M	PO	What?
M	SHIFU	I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
M	PO	But Shifu, he'll kill you.
M	SHIFU	Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
M	SHIFU (CONT'D)	Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master.
F	TIGRESS	We've got to get them out safely.
M	MONKEY	Come, little one. Let's find your mama.
F	TIGRESS	Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way.
M	JR SHAW	Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
M	PO	Hey, Dad.
M	PO'S DAD	Po!
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	Good to have you back, son!
M	PO	Good to be back.
M	PO'S DAD	Let's go Po. So, for our next shop, it's time to face it -- the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices.
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	Also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in. Hmm? You like that?
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
M	PO'S DAD (CONT'D)	Po, forget everything else. Your destiny still awaits. We are noodle folk -- broth runs deep through our veins.
M	PO	I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
M	PO'S DAD	Po, I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago...
M	PO	Okay.
M	PO'S DAD	The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup!
M	PO	Oh.
M	PO'S DAD	C'mere! The secret ingredient is... nothing!
M	PO	Huh?
M	PO'S DAD	You heard me. Nothing. There is no secret ingredient!
M	PO	Wait wait...it's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
M	PO'S DAD	Don't have to. To make something special, you just have to believe it's special.
M	PO	There is no secret ingredient...
M	TAI LUNG	I have come home, Master.
M	SHIFU	This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
M	TAI LUNG	Yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this...Po? Did I scare him off?
M	SHIFU	This battle is between you and me.
M	TAI LUNG	So. That is how it's going to be?
M	SHIFU	That is how it must be.
M	TAI LUNG	I rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness!
M	SHIFU	Obeying your master is not weakness!
M	TAI LUNG	You knew I was the Dragon Warrior! You always knew...
M	TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)	But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do? What did you do?! NOTHING!
M	SHIFU	You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
M	TAI LUNG	NOT YOUR FAULT?!
M	TAI LUNG (CONT'D)	WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?! WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY DESTINY?!
M	SHIFU	It was never my decision to make!
M	TAI LUNG	It is now.
M	TAI LUNG (CONT'D)	Give me the scroll!
M	SHIFU	I would rather die.
M	TAI LUNG	All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
M	SHIFU	I have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been proud of you. And it was my pride that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming. What I was turning you into. I'm... sorry.
M	TAI LUNG	I don't want your apology. I want my scroll! WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
M	SHIFU	Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by now. You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. Never. Never... Hey!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Stairs...
M	TAI LUNG	Who are you?
M	PO	Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior. Huhhh...
M	TAI LUNG	You?! Him?! He's a panda. You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
M	PO	Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna use this. You want it? Come and get it.
M	TAI LUNG	Finally! That scroll is mine!
M	PO	Lightning!
M	TAI LUNG	The scroll has given him power. NOOO0!!
M	TAI LUNG (CONT'D)	Finally... oh yes... the power of the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
M	TAI LUNG (CONT'D)	It's NOTHING!!
M	PO	It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either.
M	TAI LUNG	What?
M	PO	There is no secret ingredient. It's just you.
M	TAI LUNG	RRRAAAH!
M	PO	AAAAGGGHH!
M	PO (CONT'D)	Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't!
M	TAI LUNG	You... can't defeat me. You're just a big, fat panda!
M	PO	I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda.
M	TAI LUNG	The Wuxi Finger Hold!
M	PO	Oh, you know this hold?
M	TAI LUNG	You're bluffing. You're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that.
M	PO	Nope. I figured it out. Skadoosh!
M	KG SHAW	Look! The Dragon Warrior.
M	PO'S DAD	That's my boy. That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
M	PO	Thanks, Dad.
M	PO (CONT'D)	Hey, guys.
F	TIGRESS	Master.
M	FURIOUS FIVE	Master.
M	PO	Master? Master Shifu!
M	PO	Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
M	SHIFU	Po! You're alive! Or we're both dead.
M	PO	No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung!
M	SHIFU	You did?! Wow. It is as Oogway foretold -- You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace to this Valley. And to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you...
M	PO	No! Master! No No No! Don't die, Shifu. Please...
M	SHIFU	I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah, Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at peace. Finally.
M	PO	Oh. So, um, I should...stop talking?
M	SHIFU	If you can.
M	PO	Want to get something to eat?
M	SHIFU	Yeah.
