M	DICKY SPECK	Who's that stumblin around in the dark? State your business, or prepare to get winged!
M	THE RIDER	Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler. The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
M	THE RIDER	Good cold evening gentlemen. Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the'name of The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?
M	ACE SPECK	Who wants to. know?
M	THE RIDER	I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this is my horse, Fritz. Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
M	DICKY SPECK	You a doctor? Dr.SCHULTZ Affirmative.
M	DICKY SPECK	What kinda doctor? Dr.SCHULTZ Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?
M	ACE SPECK	So what? Dr.SCHULTZ So, I wish to parley with you.
M	ACE SPECK	Speak English! Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a second language. Amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire. Hello you poor devils. Is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation? Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
M	DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)	I'm from The Carrucan Plantation. Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his Dr.SCHULTZ Splendid! And what's your name young, man?
M	DJANGO	Django. Dr.SCHULTZ Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a amazing name - during your time at the Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know three overseers by the name of The Brittle Brothers? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.Schultz is delighted. Dr.SCHULTZ Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?
M	DJANGO	Dem da Brittle Brothers. Dr.SCHULTZ So Django, do you think you could recognize - ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
M	ACE SPECK	Hey, stop talkin' to him like that! Dr.SCHULTZ Like what?
M	ACE SPEC	Like that! Dr.SCHULTZ My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain
M	ACE SPECK	Speak English, goddamit! Dr.SCHULTZ Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.
M	ACE SPECK	I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya! Dr.SCHULTZ Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for sale. Ace raises his rifle towards the German.
M	ACE SPECK	Move it! Ace cocks back the rifle hammer. Dr.SCHULTZ My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention...?
M	ACE SPECK	Last chance, fancy pants Dr.SCHULTZ - Very well - The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head... .The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him... Dicky lets out a bitch like scream. The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint. Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast. But I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses. Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
M	DICKY SPECK	You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace! Dr.SCHULTZ. I only shot your brother, once he threatened to shoot me. And I do believe I have ... .one, two, three, four, five, six, seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.
M	DICKY SPECK	My damn legs busted! Dr.SCHULTZ No doubt. Now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django. As I was saying, if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, would you recognize them?
M	DJANGO	Yes.
M	Dr.SCHULTZ	Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men look alike. So Django, in a crowd of unshaven white men, can you honestly and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?
M	DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK	We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
M	DJANGO	I can point 'em out. Dr.SCHULTZ Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for Django?
M	DICKY SPECK	I'm gonna lose this leg! Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the. end result. But back to business, how much do you want for Django?
M	DICKY SPECK	You go to hell! Dr.SCHULTZ Don't be silly. How much for Django?
M	DICKY SPECK	800 dollars! Dr.SCHULTZ Oh come now, I may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does, but neither was I born yesterday. The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket. In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says that the going rate for African flesh' - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger. Which according to"this pamphlet here - and why would they lie - puts his price at eighty dollars. So in light of that, how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young Django here. Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a Dr.SCHULTZ And since your late brother. won't be using it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag. He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on Dr.SCHULTZ There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse. Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind. Dr.SCHULTZ Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale. Do you have one? Dicky just curses him. He says, removing a notebook from his pocket; Dr.SCHULTZ I thought not. No worries, I come prepared. This will serve nicely as a bill of sale. Django is spelled with a silent "D", is it not?
M	DJANGO	Huh? Dr.SCHULTZ Why not.. He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, that does add a little character. The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down Dr.SCHULTZ If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your mark here. The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor Dr.SCHULTZ Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you, but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired. The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in Dr.SCHULTZ Now as to you poor devils. He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles. Dr.SCHULTZ So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town. Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came. Or ... .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country. The choice is yours. He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds; Oh, and on the off chance that there's any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata. He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse. Just give him a little kick. Django does, and the horse responds by moving. Dr.SCHULTZ See, it's not so difficult. Dr.SCHULTZ So, Django, what do you intend to name him?
M	DJANGO	Who? Dr.SCHULTZ Your horse?
M	DJANGO	What horse? Dr.SCHULTZ' The horse you're riding.
M	DJANGO	This ain't my horse. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes it is.
M	DJANGO	No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding it. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute - technically not. If it's my horse, I can give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such. Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse, congratulations.
M	DJANGO	I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse up in no stable. Dr.SCHULTZ Don't worry about all that! They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself... So... . now that that's settled... . what do you intend to name it? Half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name. For instance my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn, ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I couldn't do without him. Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't something one does lightly. So once you've thought about it for awhile -
M	DJANGO	- Tony. Dr.SCHULTZ - Tony what?
M	DJANGO	- I dunno, Tony the horse. Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, you mean you want to name your horse Tony?
M	DJANGO	Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right? Dr.SCHULTZ When you're right you're right, indeed I did. Why Tony?
M	DJANGO	I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta tell ya. As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a Dr.SCHULTZ Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it well. Good job Django, well done. Dr.SCHULTZ What's everybody staring at?
M	DJANGO	They never seen a nigger on a horse before. Dr.SCHULTZ What's this bizarre obsession they have with. you not riding horses?
M	DJANGO	You askin' me? Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has So what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in? As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do, and what you can't do, and if you can't do it, why can't you do it? Like for instance, what if we were to walk in this saloon here, sit down at a table, order a drink, and drink it? Would the authorities frown on that?
M	DJANGO	Hell yeah, they gonna frown. Dr.SCHULTZ What part would they find the most offensive?
M	DJANGO	All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon. I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair, at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink. And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink, with no white man, in public. Dr.SCHULTZ So if you and I did those things, that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?
M	DJANGO	You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff. The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance. Well in that case Django, after you.
M	DJANGO	Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there. Dr.SCHULTZ Django you're going to have to learn to trust me, and as the man said; "There's no time like the,present." He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a Dr.SCHULTZ Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two weary travelers.
M	SALOON KEEPER	It',s still pretty early, we won't be open for about a hour. But by then we'll be servin' breakfast - He turns around and sees them.
M	SALOON KEEPER	Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy, get that nigger outta here. It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls; Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction, on what I assume is a simple county ordinance, and that would fall under the domain of the Sheriff. The Saloon Keeper runs away. The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon. Dr.SCHULTZ The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
M	DJANGO	What kinda dentist are you? This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's. Dr.SCHULTZ I haven't practiced dentistry in five years - Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure it's a disaster - But these days I practice a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter. This gets no reaction from Django. Dr.SCHULTZ Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is? The Black Man shakes his head, no. As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,
M	HE EXPLAINS;	Dr.SCHULTZ Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter, deals in corpses. The state places a bounty on a man's head. I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man. After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities - and sometimes that's easier said then done. I show that corpse to the authorities - proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him - At which point, the authorities pay me the bounty. Cheers. The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.
M	DJANGO	What's a bounty? Dr.SCHULTZ It's like a reward.
M	DJANGO	You kill people and they give you a reward? Dr.SCHULTZ Certain people, yes.
M	DJANGO	White people? Dr.SCHULTZ Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.
M	DJANGO	Bad people? Dr.SCHULTZ Badder they are, bigger the reward. Which brings me to you, and I must admit I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you. On one hand, I despise slavery. On the other hand, I need your help, and if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better. So for the time being, I'm going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit. Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty. So... I'd like the two of us to enter into an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers, however in this endeavor I'm at a slight disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?
M	DJANGO	I know what they look like, all right. Dr.SCHULTZ Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel with me till we find them -
M	DJANGO	- Where we goin'? Dr.SCHULTZ I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where. That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them. You do that, I agree to give you your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother - that's seventy-five dollars... . your horse, Tony even though I've already gave him to you -- but once the final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat included. Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window. Dr.SCHULTZ And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff. We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
M	SHERIFF SHARP	Okay boys, fun's over, come on out. Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
M	SHERIFF SHARP	Now why y'all wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people? You ain't got nothin' better to do, then to come into Bill Sharps town and show your ass - From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled. As is Django. As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading What did you jus' do to our sheriff? Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter. Now you can go get the marshall.
M	MARSHALL TATUM	Move that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon. And I want six men and six Winchesters behind it. And I want two men with two rifles on this roof, and two men with two rifles on that roof, with all barrels pointed at that front door. And somebody git poor Bill outta the goddamn street. Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place. Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number. Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons, What are they doing?
M	DJANGO	I think they wonderin' why you playin' the piana'. Dr.SCHULTZ Good. But what are they doing?
M	DJANGO	A buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front, now they hidin' behind it with guns. And a buncha other white folks are up on the roof, with rifles pointed down here. Dr.SCHULTZ Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the marshall out there?
M	DJANGO	If the one I think is the.marshall is the marshall, he's out there. Dr.SCHULTZ What makes you think he's the marshall?
M	DJANGO	Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.
M	MARSHALL'S VOICE	You in the saloon! Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.
M	MARSHALL'S VOICE	We got eleven Winchesters on every way outta that buildin'! You got once chance git outta this alive! You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and I mean, right now! Dr.SCHULTZ First things first! Is this the marshall I have the pleasure of addressing?
M	MARSHALL TATUM	Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum. Dr.SCHULTZ Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, I'm ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head. I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of The United States of America, I shant be shot down in the street, by either you or your deputies, before I've had my day in court.
M	MARSHALL TATUM	You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot 'em down like a dog in the street! Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?
M	MARSHALL TATUM	Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein' somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town! Dr.SCHULTZ Fair enough marshall, here we.come.! They're a little tense out there. So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking. Django looks at him like, "as if..." A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
M	MARSHALL TATUM	You unarmed? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I address you, your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred?
M	MARSHALL TATUM	Go on! Dr.SCHULTZ My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the court. The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of two hundred dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead or alive.
M	MARSHALL TATUM	The hell you say! Dr.SCHULTZ I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting news. But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years. I know this because. three years ago he was rustling cattle from, The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock Texas. In my possession. is a warrant made out by circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him. He will back up who I am, and who your dear departed sheriff was. The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then Dr.SCHULTZ In other words marshall, you owe me two hundred dollars. Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles One needs a plan, son. These are brutal times. A man who survives, is a man with a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with a good plan. So, having said that, what's your plan, young Django?
M	DJANGO	What'cha mean? Dr.SCHULTZ Well, after this Brittle business is behind us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and seventy five dollars in your back pocket. What's your plan after that?
M	DJANGO	Find my wife, and buy her freedom. Dr.SCHULTZ Django, I had no idea you were a married man. Do most slaves take the institution of matrimony seriously?
M	DJANGO	Huh?
M	ZZ	Dr.SCHULTZ Do slaves believe in marriage'?
M	DJANGO	Me and my wife do. Dr.SCHULTZ Where is she now?
M	DJANGO	I dunno. They put us in different boxcars, and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction. She got sold two days 'fore me. But I don't know who to. Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky. Dr.SCHULTZ Care for some jerky?
M	DJANGO	Sure. Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,
M	SCHULTZ SAYS;	Dr.SCHULTZ So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know where she is? A chewing Django nods his head, yes. Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating Dr.SCHULTZ Well that shouldn't be all that difficult. So how long ago did all this happen?
M	DJANGO	A few months ago. Dr.SCHULTZ Three or four?
M	DJANGO	Three. Dr.SCHULTZ So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation, and shewassold at The Greenville Slave Auctiontosome :unknown customer three monthsago? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ The bad part about slavery being a business, is it's immoral. The good part about it being a business is, they keep records. Somewhere in Greenville there's a book with your wife's name in it, and the name of the customer who bought her, and more then likely their address. But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts. Dr.SCHULTZ Still, seventy-five dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's not going to get you very far in Greenville. Not to mention a slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the safest place you could visit. Free or not.
M	DJANGO	I'll have my freedom papers. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes you will. But say you show them to some rascals, and they take them from you and tear them up?
M	DJANGO	They could do that? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not saying they would, but they could.
M	DJANGO	They do that I'll kill 'em. Dr.SCHULTZ Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white man. The point being is the place,is just too dangerous for you.
M	DJANGO	Well I gotta go, when do I go? Dr.SCHULTZ When you get more dangerous. Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
M	DJANGO	is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him. Dr.SCHULTZ Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act". You're playing a character. Your character is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears. Remember what I told you. During the act, you can never break character. We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
M	SPENCER BENNETT	It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory. Dr.SCHULTZ This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	I said niggers -
M	Z .ate`	Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Django, he's a free man, and he can ride what he pleases.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	Not on my.property, around my niggers he can't. Dr.SCHULTZ My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell. My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my valet, Django, and these are our horses, Fritz, and Tony. Fritz, does his head bow. This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
M	Dr.SCHULTZ	Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you are a gentleman, and a business man. And it is in these capacities that we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk with you now.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	State your business. Dr.SCHULTZ I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals, no appointment, no nuttin'? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm afraid so.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	Well what if I say, I don't like you, or your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta say about that? Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man, I've been led to believe you to be, I have five thousand things I might say, that could change your mind. i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool to drink. The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django. Dr.SCHULTZ Maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.
M	SPENCER	Absolutely. Betina! A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
F	BETINA	Yes sir, Big Daddy? What's your Jimmies name again? Dr.SCHULTZ Django.
M	SPENCER	Betina sugar, take Django around the grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.
F	BETINA	As you please, Big Daddy. Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner; Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a free man. He cannot be treated like a slave. Within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself.
M	SPENCER	Understood., Schultz. Betina?
F	BETINA	Yes, sir?
M	SPENCER	Django isn't a slave. Django is a free man. Do you understand? You're not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here, cause he ain't like any of these other niggers around here. Ya got it?
F	BETINA	Ya want I should treat 'em like white folks?
M	SPENCER	No that's not what I said.
F	BETINA	Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.
M	SPENCER	Yes, I can see that. What's the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass? His mama works at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes the winda's when we have a problem? The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;
M	MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR	Oh, you mean Jerry.
M	SPENCER	Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry. You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?
F	BETINA	Yes 'em, Big Daddy.
M	SPENCER	Well that's it then... just treat 'em like you would Jerry.
F	BETINA	What'cha do for your massa'?
M	DJANGO	Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.
F	BETINA	So you really free?
M	DJANGO	Yes.
F	BETINA	You mean you wanna dress like that? Django fumes. Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
M	Dr.SCHULTZ	I've been'told by those who should know, the most exquisite African flesh in the state of Tennessee is bred right here on your land. And from the look of these black angels, my sources weren't wrong.
M	SPENCER	Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the field. But the lion share of my lady niggers are real show pony's. Dr.SCHULTZ Well that's what I'm looking for, a show pony for young Django. So the only question that remains is, do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars?
M	SPENCER	Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger, is practically my middle name.
M	BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA	Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
M	DJANGO	Betina, come over here, I need to ask you something. He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
F	BETINA	What'cho want?
M	DJANGO	I'm lookin' for three white men. Three brothers. Overseers. Their name is Brittle. Do you know 'em?
F	BETINA	Brittle?
M	DJANGO	Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle. And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.
F	BETINA	I don't know dem.
M	DJANGO	They could be usin' a different name. They woulda' come to the plantation in the last year.
F	BETINA	You mean The Shaffer's?
M	DJANGO	Maybe? Three brother?
F	BETINA	Ah-huh.
M	DJANGO	Are they here?
F	BETINA	Ah-huh.
M	DJANGO	Can you point one of 'em out to me?
F	BETINA	Well ones over in that field. She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but

M	DJANGO	Yep. He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.
M	DJANGO	Where's the other two?
M	BETINA.	They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.
M	DJANGO	They whippin' Little Jody? She nods her head, yes.
M	DJANGO	Point me in that direction. She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.
F	BETINA	You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way. Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."
M	DJANGO	Go git that white man, I came here with. He slaps her ass, to hurry her up. Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him

M	DJANGO	Please Big John, she won't do it no more! She's real sorry! The WHIP RIPS her back. Goddamit, Big John!
M	LITTLE RAJ	Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny. Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
M	BACK TO DJANGO	crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.
M	FLASH ON	Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the
M	BIG JOHN BRITTLE	I like the way you beg, boy. Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen) BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
M	BIG JOHN BRITTLE	Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know yourself it's for your own good. Niggers are clumsy. You'd break everything in goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the only known cure for nigger clumsiness is a peelin'. Little Jody begs to differ.
M	BACK TO DJANGO	As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
M	BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE	In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.
M	BIG JOHN	After this we'll see if you break eggs again.
M	DJANGO	turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see .DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;
M	DJANGO	John Brittle! Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice. BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django. So does Roger.
M	LITTLE RAJ	Django? Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
M	DJANGO	Remember me? .Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
M	BIG JOHN FACE	goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
M	DJANGO	I like the way you die, boy. Big John hears it...then tips over dead. LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen. FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain. MORE SLAVES gather.
M	DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND	whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks Dr.SCHULTZ Who are they?
M	DJANGO	That's John Brittle, and that's his little brother Raj. Dr.SCHULTZ Where's Ellis?
M	DJANGO	He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now. Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
M	SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER	goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel. Are you sure that's him? Ellis gets further away... Yes! Are you positive? Ellis gets further away...
M	DJANGO	I dunno. Dr.SCHULTZ You don't know if you're positive? Ellis gets further away...
M	DJANGO	I don't know what, positive,'means. Dr.SCHULTZ It means you're sure.
M	DJANGO	Yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, what?
M	DJANGO	Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
M	BAM!	The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse. The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention. Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB. Dr.SCHULTZ Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!
M	SPENCER	Just who the hell are you two jokers? Drï¿½. SCHULTZ I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America. The man to my left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy. In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and Roger Brittle --
M	DJANGO	- They were goin by the name, Shaffer. Dr.SCHULTZ You know them by the name, Shaffer. But the butchers real names'were Brittle. These are wanted men. The law wants them for murder. I reiterate, this warrant states dead or alive. When Django and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize passions are high. But I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against a officer of the court in the performance of his duty is, you will be hung by the neck until you are dead. This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust. .Dr.Schultz says; May I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it? Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
M	SPENCER	Gimmie. Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to Dr.SCHULTZ Satisfied. Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German. Dr.SCHULTZ May I have that back? ,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper. Dr.SCHULTZ We good?
M	BENNETT	Get off my land. Dr.SCHULTZ Post haste. Load up the bodies as quickly as you can, and let's get out of here. All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
M	BENNETT	Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie while you on my property. But for lettin' a nigger kill a white man, and especially for letting a nigger kill a white man in a audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make it out of the county alive. Mark my words Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin' from my motherfuckin' gate. Dr.SCHULTZ I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your regulator playmates aren't shy about killing for what you believe in. But mark my words Big Daddy, if you make a move towards Django or myself, you better be prepared to die for it. The two men ride off. The Black and White Audience watch them go. INSERT: Dr.Schultz's SADDLE BAG, the doctor's hands remove THREE STICKS INSERT: The doctor's HANDS bind the Three Sticks of Dynamite together.
M	CU SPENCER BENNETT	lying on his belly in the grass.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	That's them sonsabitches.
M	SPENCER'S POV:	We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
M	SPENCER BENNETT	Now unless they start shootin' first, nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple for these jokers. We're gonna whip that nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna personally, strip and clip that garboon myself. Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
M	SPENCER BENNETT	Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing. He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
M	BRADSHAW	We ready, or what?
M	SPENCER BENNETT	Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes. Shit ...I just made it worse. He rips. it off his head in frustration.
M	RANDY	I can't see shit either.
M	REDFISH	Who made this goddamn shit?
M	0. B.	Willards wife.
M	WILLARD	Well make you own goddamn masks! Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
M	REDFISH	Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I could cut it better then this. How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?
M	ROBERT	Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head, I can see you pretty good ... . more or less. But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving all over, and I'm riding blind. Randy tears at his bag.
M	RANDY	Oh shit, I just made mine worse. He puts it on-then says;
M	RANDY	Yep, it's worse. He yanks it off his head.
M	RANDY	Did anybody bring any extra bags?
M	TERRY	No, no one brought a extra bag!
M	RANDY	I'm just asking.
M	DOUG	Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?
M	SPENCER	Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose. Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.
M	REDFISH	I can't see in this fucking thing! I can't breathe in this fucking thing! And I can't ride in this fucking thing!
M	WILLARD	Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches! And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize. From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'! Willard rides off. O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.
M	SPENCER	O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep, not dead.
M	O.B.	But Willards riding off.
M	SPENCER	Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill. And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.
M	RANDY	Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off? Robert takes off his bag, and says;
M	ROBERT	I think we all think the bags was a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they could of been done better. So how 'bout, no bags this time, but next time, we do the bags right, and then we go full regalia. Everyone takes off their bag.
M	SPENCER	Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!
M	TERRY	But nobody can see.
M	SPENCER	So?
M	TERRY	So, it would be nice to see.
M	SPENCER	Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you can't see, so what? All that matters is can the fuckin horse see! That's a raid. Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well. The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over Then amongst the confusion...
M	A BIG TREE	on the other side of the lake Then quickly cut into The Tree. Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

M	SPENCER BENNETT	falls from his horse, dead.
M	DJANGO	scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to Dr.SCHULTZ Like that, huh? Referring to the scope sight rifle;
M	DJANGO	I like. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, I think while they take this opportunity to lick their wounds, we should take this opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee. They hop out of the tree.
M	MONTAGE	Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too dangerous for you to go fucking around there. You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York. You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't even be forty miles on any side of Greenville., You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.
M	DJANGO	If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out where she went, then I gotta go. Now you were sayin' where I gotta go first? Dr.SCHULTZ There'should be some sort of records office. You know when she was sold, you know where she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and you know her name ... . what is her name?
M	DJANGO	Broomhilda. Schultz reacts. Dr.SCHULTZ Broomhilda? Django.nods his head yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Were her owners German? Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?
M	DJANGO	Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can speak a little German too. Dr.SCHULTZ Your wife?
M	DJANGO	Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to talk German with. Dr.SCHULTZ So let me get this straight, your slave wife speaks German, and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft...?
M	DJANGO	Yep. Mouthful, huh? Dr.SCHULTZ To say the least. This looks like a very pretty place to have our picnic. What'd ya say, here?
M	DJANGO	How did you know Broomhilda's first masters were German? Dr.SCHULTZ Broomhilda is a German name. If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.
M	DJANGO	Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda? Dr.SCHULTZ No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of all the German legends.
M	DJANGO	Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes there is.
M	DJANGO	Do you know it? Dr.SCHULTZ Every German knows that story. Would you like me to tell you? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods. Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
M	DJANGO	What she do.?
M	Dr.SCHULTZ	I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys him in some way. So at first he's just going to obliterate her -
M	DJANGO	Obliterate... . what does that mean? Dr.SCHULTZ Like blow up. He pantomimes a explosion.
M	DJANGO	Phew, that's pretty mad. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a little time, he calms down a bit. He's still mad at her. He still wants to punish her. Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.
M	DJANGO	Broomhilda's on a mountain? Dr.SCHULTZ It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain. And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire. And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.
M	DJANGO	Does a fella arise? From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he Dr.SCHULTZ Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella named, Sigfried.
M	DJANGO	Does Sigfried save her? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so. Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because he's not afraid.of him. He walks through hellfire because Broomhilda's worth. it. After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
M	DJANGO	I know how he feels. Dr.SCHULTZ I think I'm just starting to realize that. He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he Dr.SCHULTZ Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscious. Let me ask you a question, how do you like the bounty hunting business?
M	DJANGO	Kill white folks, and they pay ya? What's not to like? Dr.SCHULTZ I hafta admit, we make a good team.
M	DJANGO	But I'thought you were mad at me for killin' Big John and Rodger? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous. But normally, that's a good thing. How'd you like to partner up for the winter?
M	DJANGO	What'd ya mean partner up? Dr.SCHULTZ You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece. With one man, anything over three men is a risk. But with a partner? Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel. A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills for the winter.
M	DJANGO	You makin' another agreement? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes. You work with me through the winter, till the snow melts. I give you a third of my bounties. And while we're together, I'll teach you a few things you're going to need to know.
M	DJANGO	Can you teach me how to make Tony do that head bow thing that Fritz can do? Dr.SCHULTZ That among other things. We make some money this winter, when the snow melts, I'll take you to Greenville myself, and we'll find where they sent your wife. I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal? No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
M	DJANGO	Why you care what happens to me? Why you care if I find my wife? Dr.SCHULTZ Well frankly, I've never given anybody their freedom before. And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're just not ready to go off on your own, it's that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt. Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,. it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda. Django accepts that response. What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
M	WE SEE	A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
M	DOWN BELOW WE SEE	A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says; Dr.SCHULTZ Keep down or he'll see you.
M	DJANGO	Who that farmer? Who cares? Dr.SCHULTZ Well since we came here to kill 'em, he just might.
M	DJANGO	What? The little man pushin' that plow? Dr.SCHULTZ That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.
M	DJANGO	Smitty Bacall is a farmer? Dr.SCHULTZ No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber who's hiding out as a farmer, because there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head. He hands Django the scope rifle case. Dr.SCHULTZ And he's all yours my boy. DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.
M	SCOPE SIGHT POV:	on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates. Dr.SCHULTZ Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white folks for money?
M	DJANGO	His son's with him. Dr.SCHULTZ Good. He'll have a loved one with him. Maybe even share a last word. That's better then most get, and a damn. sight better then he deserves. Django still hesitates. Dr.SCHULTZ Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill. Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson. "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members. Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as Dr.SCHULTZ Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two, they would never of printed that. But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didn't mind killing people to do it. You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do. I kill people, and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse is worth seven thousand dollars. Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him. Django SHOOTS. The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down. Dr.SCHULTZ You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.
M	DJANGO	Why? Dr.SCHULTZ It's good luck. You always keep the handbill of your first bounty. They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body, As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's Dr.SCHULTZ See, they're having a tender little father son moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one they've ever had. It's now full on snowy winter in the hills. Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks He DRAWS... Shoots the bottle heart! He DRAWS ... Shoots the left coal eye. He DRAWS ... Shoots the right coal eye. He DRAWS... Shoots the carrot nose. Dr.Schultz comes up behind him. Dr.SCHULTZ I think it's safe to say you're faster then the snowman. A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
M	DJANGO AND SCHULTZ	up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them. The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.
M	SHERIFF GUS	Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya, and who the hell ya got there? Dr.SCHULTZ The Wilson - Lowe Gang.
M	SHERIFF GUS	Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang? Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands Dr.SCHULTZ Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe. And three of their acolytes.
M	SHERIFF GUS	Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love 'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee. The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office. Django RIPS IT off the wall. As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ... He looks up from the ground at Schultz.
M	5L	As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says; Dr.SCHULTZ You're pretty confident aren't you? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ You have reason to be. He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
M	DJANGO	Still think I'm too green for Greenville? Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says; Oh you're ready for Greenville. He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says; Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so sure. He blows out the match...
M	WE GO TO BLACK	What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of

M	JUDD	Good god almighty these niggers stink!

We gittin ready to open these doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you niggers better comprehend.

Train to pen as fast as you can! The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES We spot Django during the running. Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.

M	CALVIN CANDIE	Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like to welcome an attractive couple'like yourselves to my favorite place on earth. Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.
M	SCOTTY	Thank you so much, it's a great honor. We love it here. Pointing at a empty chair.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	May I join you?-
M	SCOTTY	Please, by all means. Calvin sits down. Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How long have you been a member?
M	SCOTTY	We just joined this weekend.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage. Some may consider the dues excessive, but they're necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.
M	SCOTTY	Well said, and money well spent. He squeezes Broomhilda's hand. Candie sees this.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	It would be.my pleasure, your first weekend at the club, to join me and my friends at my table. Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided. But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie. We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
M	NARRATOR (VO)	After excusing herself, she walked across the street to her hotel room. She got her white dress dirty in the mud, but she didn't care, the night was ruined anyway. Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her. She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time. She's gonna scrape every pimple. The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.
M	NARRATOR (VO)	Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly card game. As the game wore on, it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight. Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers Really? You know what Sheba just tole me? Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;
M	SCOTTY	What?
F	CANDIE	She says she thinks you're cute.
M	SCOTTY	Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're beautiful. Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.
F	CANDIE	Sheba says she'd like to give you a little lip. Want some lip? Scotty, is a little surprised.
M	SCOTTY	Well, she's your Pony...I mean...
F	CANDIE	Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar. Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip The game continues. G
F	CANDIE	Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out brazen me in my own club, and I won't have it. If you're really holding cards, time to pony up. I raise you five hundred. Candie throws in his chips.
M	SCOTTY.	I see your five hundred... .and raise you four hundred more. Call. This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Not so fast, boy. Pot ain't fat enough yet.
M	SCOTTY	I'm all in.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Ain't that too bad. Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
M	SCOTTY	I would think a southern gentleman of such renown as yourself, wouldn't have to resort to buying a pot in his own club. Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	One final raise. Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"
M	CALVIN CANDIE	It's Sheba's bill of sale.
M	SCOTTY	What? I don't want her. Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You sure didn't look like you didn't want her. More laughter.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	In Greenville slaves are currency. And Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars. I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or fold?
M	SCOTTY	I'm all out of money.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	But we ain't playin' for money no more.. We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal you got.
M	SCOTTY	I can't bet Broomhilda.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper and a pencil. Somebody does.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards. Scotty makes a pressured decision. He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
M	SCOTTY	Let me see your cards! Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH. What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.
M	SCOTTY	You cheated me. After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What did you just call me?
M	SCOTTY	I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch, cause that's what you are! Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat in my own club, as a southern gentleman, I challenge you to a duel. Piano player, will you hit three separate notes? On the third note, pick up the gun and try to kill me. Piano player please ... This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.
M	SCOTTY	Wait a minute ...no!
M	SCOTTY	I ain't dueling with you! I don't want to duel!
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Then get out of here, get in your buggy and get out of town.
M	SCOTTY	Sure. Let me just get my girl.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You lost that girl, fat boy.
M	SCOTTY	Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I called you a cheat. But... please...I can't give you Broomhilda.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta to fuckin' another one. Or pick up that gun. Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his Calvin Candie SHOOTS Scotty Harmony dead. Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Hello Oliver.
M	FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER)	Hello Mr.Candie, good evening.
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver. Could you please inform me which room your guest Scott Harmony is staying in? Broomhilda is asleep in bed... .Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He She hops out of bed. Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs, She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Welcome to Candyland. We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face. That was four months ago. Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
M	ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)	stands half naked on the auction block. gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding. Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW, Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the owner of Candyland.
M	DJANGO	Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place? Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, so you heard of it?
M	DJANGO	Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland. Dr.SCHULTZ Well apparently, that's where your wife is, and apparently the repellent gentleman down there is the one who owns her. The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction Dr.SCHULTZ How much do you know about mandingo fighting?
M	DJANGO	Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had a couple niggers he'd fight. Dr.SCHULTZ Can you play a mandingo expert?
M	DJANGO	What? Dr.SCHULTZ Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters?
M	DJANGOÂ¢	Why? Dr.SCHULTZ Because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get his attention, we better be talking about big sweaty black males. So my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game. And your character is the mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.
M	DJANGO	They call that "One-Eyed Charly." Dr.SCHULTZ. One-Eyed Charly?
M	DJANGO	That's what you call it when you buy a slave expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses. He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco. Dr'. SCHULTZ Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?
M	DJANGO	You know, back on the plantation, my. job wasn't historian. Dr.SCHULTZ Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly legitimate question. So, can you convincingly play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say, yes, if you can't.
M	DJANGO	You want me to play a black slaver? There ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black slavers are lower then head house niggers, and buddy, that's pretty fuckin low. Dr.SCHULTZ Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver. Django gets that. Dr.SCHULTZ Can you do that?
M	DJANGO	That, I can do. What's next? Dr.SCHULTZ To get ourselves personally invited to Candyland by Calvin Candie himself. Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club. Bonjour. Dr.SCHULTZ Bonjour, mon petite femme noire. We are here to see Calvin Candie. She's been taught to smile and say:
M	FRENCH MAID	Enter. The two men walk into the entrance way of the house. Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you? Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my associate, Django Freeman. Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him. Dr.SCHULTZ We're here for a appointment with Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.
F	CLEO	Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please make yourself comfortable. I'll inform Monsieur Candie you've arrived. Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen a tasty refreshment? Dr.SCHULTZ Not at the moment.
F	CLEO	Then Coco will entertain you while I inform Monsieur Candie. Dr.SCHULTZ How charming. Cleo leaves. Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside. Some appear to be on dates. Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary, - Some are.two men with two women. Some are one man with two or three or more women. The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks; Dr.SCHULTZ Have you ever seen anything like this before? Django shakes his head, no. Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You like catfish, we got good catfish. They use alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we got sand dabs. LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.
M	MOGUY	Dr.Schultz, good to see you again. Dr.SCHULTZ Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity for this appointment. Mr.MOGUY Nonsense, it's my job. Mr.MOGUY .So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard so much about. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.
M	MOGUY	Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come along too? Dr.SCHULTZ We would be quite lucky indeed if the charming Coco cared.to follow. Coco blushes.
M	MOGUY	You better watch out doctor, you gonna steal this little pony's heart. They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they
M	SAY;	Dr.SCHULTZ How long have you been associated with Mr.Candie?
M	MOGUY	Calvin and I were about eleven when we went to boarding school together. One could almost say, I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
M	DJANGO	One could almost say, you a nigger. Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
M	MOGUY	What did you say? Dr.SCHULTZ Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky. Anything else about Mr.Candie I should know before I meet him?
M	MOGUY	Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile. Dr.SCHULTZ What civilized people aren't?
M	MOGUY	That's why all the French ambiance. And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie. Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; Dr.SCHULTZ What ever he prefers. This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.
M	MOGUY	Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him. They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room. The party enters the billiard room. Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
M	VASSEPI.	Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Why do you want to get in the mandingo business? That's quite abrupt and aggressive. Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted; Dr.SCHULTZ You don't intend to allow your 2nd... .to make the proper introductions? Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Quit stalling and answer the question. The room is quiet. Dr.SCHULTZ The awful truth? I'm bored, and it seems like a good bit of fun. Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight goin on that's a good bit of fun_ Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
M	CALVIN CANDIE.	The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought him today. What's his name, Moguy?
M	MOGUY	Big Fred.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	The other nigger belongs to this disreputable Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi. What's your nigger's name?
M	AMERIGO	Luigi... .? Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin' a good bit of fun?
M	DJANGO	You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How'd you two like to try the signature drink of the club? We'd love to.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and don't spare the rum. Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses. Big Fred kills Luigi. Candie and his friends cheer.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks like you owe me ten dollars. Amerigo pays up the puny bet. Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a Candle turns his attention to Django.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What's your name, boy? Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Django. Where'd ya dig him up? Dr.SCHULTZ A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together. I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a real bright boy. I'm curious, what makes you such a mandingo expert?
M	DJANGO	I'm curious, what makes you so curious? Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;
M	BARTHOLOMEW	What you say, boy? /ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle. Dr.SCHULTZ Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if you directed your line of inquiry to me.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you. Dr.SCHULTZ With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I didn't seek you out for your advice. I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price. I was'under the impression when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	No we weren't talking business yet. We were discussing my curiosity. Now according to Moguy here, if I do business with you... , .I'm doin' business with both of y'all. He does the eyeballin', you the billfold? Dr.SCHULTZ Well you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yes. None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who Candie turns his attention back to Django. So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you looked over my African flesh, and were none too impressed.
M	FLASH ON	we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..
M	DJANGO	Not for top dollar.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well then we got nothing more to talk about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me, those are the beat ass niggers I wanna sell.
M	DJANGO	He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell. He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell. Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;- Dr.SCHULTZ You won't sell your best. You won't even sell your second best. But your third best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it... . who knows what could happen?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What do you consider ridiculous? Dr.SCHULTZ. For a truly talented specimen, ."The Right Nigger"..:? How much would you say, Django?
M	DJANGO	Twelve thousand dollars. Calvin Candle takes in the figure.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now you got my attention.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How ya like that meat, Bright Boy? Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval. How's your Catfish, dew drop?
F	COCO	Real good Monsieur Candie. You spend a lot of time around niggers aside from Freeman here? Dr.SCHULTZ Not so much.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a treat this was for 'em. You feel special Coco?
F	COCO	Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You feel special Bartholomew?
M	BARTHOLOMEW	Yes sir, Monsieur Candie. He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?
F	SHEBA	Yep.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel special? Not as special as her. The table breaks out in laughter.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well we're leaving bright and early tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole kit and caboodle to "Candyland." You oughta come with us. Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good. Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I suppose I could be amenable to that. How far must we trek?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops. There you can get a look at my best specimens. Have dinner with my sister and I. Spend the night at Candyland as my guest. Dr.SCHULTZ Splendid. Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles. It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
M	RODNEY	walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
M	FLASH ON	Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.
M	RODNEY	gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.
M	DJANGO ON TONY	sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let He yells down to the powerless man;
M	DJANGO	Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy? Rodney looks away.
M	RODNEY	No sir.
M	DJANGO	You want a boot heel in it?
M	RODNEY	No sir.
M	DJANGO	Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me! Flash that bad look at me again, I'll give ya reason not to like me! As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him. Dr.SCHULTZ How do you like this side of the slave trade?
M	DJANGO	Not so much. Dr.SCHULTZ Prefer the other side?
M	DJANGO	I didn't say that.
M	Dr.SCHULTZ	I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.
M	DJANGO	Are you sure it's her? Dr.SCHULTZ He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and speaks German. Now while it's not wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.
M	DJANGO	Did you offer to buy her? Dr.SCHULTZ I opened the door to my possible interest. But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be so interested. Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Am I intruding? Dr.SCHULTZ Of course not. I swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish. Dr.SCHULTZ You'd be surprised what a good conversationalist Django is.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Oh by now, I don't think that would surprise meat all. Candie gives Django a creepy smile. Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance. When do we reach your property?
M	CALVIN CANDLE	You been on it. I own the whole sixty miles 'fore we get to Candyland. Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. Billy Crash, git up here! Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
M	BILLY CRASH	Yeah, Boss?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack!
M	BILLY CRASH	Right away, Boss. Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You know, confidentially, just 'tween us girls, worse things about this business, ain't the slaves. It's all the white trash ya gotta deal with. Like these peckawoods we got riding with us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but it's just a thin membrane separate 'em. And don't think they don't know it either. It's about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em. Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass, other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain boys I use as trackers for the runaways, they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was a pain in the ass, but with a lot of patience, that German lady taught Hildi how to speak German. Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other hand, they can barely speak English. I can't understand a damn word most of 'em say. You could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run, they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog. Billy Crash comes riding back.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What the hell's goin on?
M	BILLY CRASH	They got 'em a runaway.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Who? A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
M	MARSHA.	A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt, The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do a fool thing like run off?
M	D'ARTAGNAN	I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Oh yes you can. You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher, shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear myself think! Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha; Mr.STONESIPHER Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up! Marsha, Marsha, hush up! Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger, he's just makin' em hungry. The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How long was he loose? Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice. Mr.STONESIPHER A.night. Day. Half the other night.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How far he git off property? Mr.STONESIPHER Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer, considering that limp he got.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight Friday?.
M	MOGUY	One of this new lot.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well the way he looks now a blind Indian wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em. Boy, you done made yourself as useless as a tail on a teddy bear. D'Artagnan starts begging.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my soft heart. You in trouble now, son. Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a business. Now I done paid five hundred dollars for you. And when I pay five hundred dollars, I expect to get five fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over and play dead. You've fought three fights.
M	D'ARTAGNAN	I won every one.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well, yes you did. But that last one, you muddied the line between winning and losing.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	But the fact remains, I pay five hundred dollars, I want five fights. So what about my five hundred dollars? You gonna reimburse me? The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh. This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach. Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor Calvin prods further.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You even know what reimburse means? The Whites laugh. Then SUDDENLY ... .The German Speaks; Dr.SCHULTZ I'll reimburse you. All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz. Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You will? Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket. Yes.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You'll pay five hundred dollars for a one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a broom? Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.
M	DJANGO	No he won't. All eyes turn to Django.
M	DJANGO	He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is all. And for that matter, so am I. But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny, we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that right, Doc? Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached Dr.SCHULTZ You heard 'em. The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the !` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life..Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher? Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS. Mr.STONESIPHER That's right. Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well now since you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin' this nigger however I see fit?
M	DJANGO	He's your nigger.

M	DJANGO	If you wanna know who I am, or the name of my horse, you ask me.
M	STEPHEN	Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it funny. Django's a Freeman. Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.
M	STEPHEN	This nigger, here?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	That nigger there. Let me at least introduce the two of. you. Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen. Stephen, this is Django. You two should hate each other. Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
M	STEPHEN	Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz are customers, and they are our guests Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard... .are to show them every hospitality. Do you understand that?
M	STEPHEN	I don't know why I gotta -
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You don't hafta know why, do you understand?
M	STEPHEN	Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Good. They're spending the night. Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready. He's gonna stay in the Big House?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different. In the Big House?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You gotta problem with that?
M	STEPHEN	I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta problem with burin' the bed, the sheets, and the pillow cases once this black ass motherfuckers gone!
M	CALVIN CANDIE	That's my problem, they're mine to burn. Your problem, right now, is making a good impression. And I want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready. The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;
M	STEPHEN	Yes sir, Monsieur Candie. Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may I present to you, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly. Lara Lee does a southern lady bow. Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner. I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd Django, and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony. Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow. And it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose.
M	LARA LEE	Well aren't you the charming gentlemen. You're not from around here, are you? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually I'm from a far off land, Dusseldorf, to be exact.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	These two are in the market for a fightin' nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down, show 'em my stock.
M	LARA LEE	We'll all have dinner tonight, right?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Half the reason I invited them. I thought you'd find.them as intriguing as I do little sister. Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You know since I started fightin' niggers about eleven years ago, it's been a new lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here now is the man responsible for all my success. Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Howdy Ace. This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, Ace Woody. Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells Cody. Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and Django Freeman, they're big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I brought 'em out here so you could give 'em a little display of our African flesh. Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.
M	ACE WOODY	Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen. Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
M	ACE WOODY	These the new chickens?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Yes siree bob.
M	ACE WOODY	How many you get? One, two, three, four, five.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Five real strong bucks.
M	ACE WOODY	How many you get rid of?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	We still got three left. Ace looks to see who came back from the auction. Leo Moguy chimes in;
M	MOGUY	I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people, they'll be here tomorrow. Ace turns to Brown.
M	ACE WOODY	Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in the pen till tomorrow. Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
M	ACE WOODY	Y'all stand over there and make a line! They do. Ace climbs down from off his horse. Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What do you think?
M	ACE WOODY	I think you lookin' for niggers to push a plow, 'dem your boys. Candie rolls his eyes.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What's wrong with them?
M	ACE WOODY	Hold it...hold it, you done bought r em, let me look at 'em. Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.
M	ACE WOODY	Okay, how 'bout that one, did you buy that one?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Which one?
M	ACE WOODY	What you mean, which one? The one I'm pointing at, that one.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Actually, that one was purchased by our mister Moguy. You bought him?
M	MOGUY	Yes I did.
M	ACE WOODY	Why?
M	MOGUY	I like his prospects.
M	ACE WOODY	His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy, I ain't a educated fella like yourself. Remind me again what prospects means?
M	MOGUY	Hope for the future. Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.
M	ACE WOODY	You got hope for his future?
M	MOGUY	I did.
M	ACE WOODY	Well I don't. Ace walks over to the slave in question.
M	ACE WOODY	What's your name, boy? The mandingo says;
M	SIDNEY JAMES	Sidney James, sir.
M	ACE WOODY	So long Sidney James. Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS Everybody reacts. Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
M	ACE WOODY	Boss Candie, which one did you buy?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well to me the pick of the litter is Big Fred over there. This one over here?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Yes. You Fred? A very scared Fred answers.
M	BIG FRED	Yes, sir.
M	ACE WOODY	Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody, I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in a kurfuffle?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers last night.
M	'ACE WOODY	How is of Amerigo?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	His nigger lost. Really? You won?
M	BIG FRED	Yes, sir.
M	ACE WOODY	Wup'ed his ass?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Beat 'em to death. Smiling impressively at Big Fred. Really?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	He did have fifteen pounds on 'em, but still, he still beat his ass to death. You did? Yes, sir.
M	ACE WOODY	Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?
M	BIG FRED	Yes, sir. Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back. The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now why did you do that?
M	ACE WOODY	He won his last fight last night. Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos Those of you with exceptional ability will find it ain't so bad here. Those of you who don't possess exceptional ability, will wish you did. Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.
M	ACE WOODY	Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em in the head. Welcome to Candyland, boys! Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena. Candie leans over to Schultz and says;
M	CALVIN CANDLE	We only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy. But those two tend to be lucky. Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think that you don't trust my judgement? Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;
M	ACE WOODY	Oh you know I always trust your judgement, Boss Candie...eventually. He rides off. Stephen limps back to the action.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?
M	STEPHEN	All ready for your guest and his nigger. Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Stephen, you're incorrigible. Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your rooms. There you can lie down and rest up for a couple of hours. Then we'll have some lemonade, and I'll show off some of my finer specimens. Dr.SCHULTZ Splendid. Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em. Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load of oats. Django hands the boy the reigns.
M	DJANGO	That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good care of 'em now.
M	TIMMY	Yes, sir. Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.
M	DJANGO	Once he's in the stable, give 'em that. He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.
M	DJANGO	Give that one to Fritz. Timmy leads the horses away. The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Nigger girl? Dr.SCHULTZ I believe you said she spoke German?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?
M	,oz.	Dr.SCHULTZ Do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	I don't see why not. Stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi. I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice, and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room. Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.
M	STEPHEN	Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's somethin' we ain't tole you yet.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What?
M	STEPHEN	Hildi's in The Hot Box. This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What's she doin' there?
M	STEPHEN	What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box, she bein punished.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What she do?
M	STEPHEN	She ran away again.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Jesus Christ, how many people ran away when I was gone?
M	STEPHEN	Two.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	When did she go?
M	STEPHEN	Last night. They brought her back this morning.
M	CALVIN CANDLE	How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up? Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
M	STEPHEN	Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out lookin' for her and found her. She a little beat up, but she did that to herself. Runnin' through them damn bushes. Django's hand moves away from his gun.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	How long she been in the box?
M	STEPHEN	What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little fool got ten more days to go.
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Take her out. Take her out? Why!
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.
M	STEPHEN	But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest? I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take her out. Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and presentable for Dr.Schultz? The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While The HOT BOX itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine. Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her. DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
M	REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS	as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE. You comin', or you wanna sleep in that little box? Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
M	STEPHEN	This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn nice too. Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
M	STEPHEN	Feel free to touch anything you want, cause we burnin' all this shit once you gone. I'll have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready. Django sits down on the bed. Stephen turns to leave.
M	DJANGO	Not so fast.
M	STEPHEN	I got more important things to do then jaw with you.
M	DJANGO	Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots. Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.
M	DJANGO	This tiny bell on this little table... .is this for you? I ring this, you do fer me?
M	STEPHEN	Me or somebody. Django reaches over and picks up the bell. What 'cha want?
M	DJANGO	I want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up. Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.
M	)O'	Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
M	DJANGO	Gimmie. Stephen hands him the basin full of water. Django takes it from him. Then throws the water in Stephen's face. The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.
M	DJANGO	Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like that? Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
M	DJANGO	That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up. The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
M	DJANGO	I've known me House Niggers like you my whole life. Play your dog tricks with your Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an' then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and all the white folks think it's so cute. Meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your good side. Well this time Snowball, you gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass you wanna sling my way, before they give us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK off your ass. I will make you drop your drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of every nigga on this plantation. And after I do that, let's see you play the rooster round here.
M	STEPHEN	Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.
M	DJANGO	Oh that's right, he gives you first name privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me me again nigger, see what happen'. Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.
M	DJANGO	That's what I thought. Now git outta"here. With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
M	DJANGO	When I ring this bell, you better come a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While I'm on this property, you my nigger Snowball. Stephen leaves. Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm. Dr.SCHULTZ Was that wise? Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.
M	DJANGO	He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that. That's all that needs to be said. Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a Dr.Schultz opens the door. Dr.SCHULTZ Hello ladies. DOG
M	LARA LEE	Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you, Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he speaks German. Dr.SCHULTZ I've been informed you do as well. It would be my, pleasure to speak with you in German. Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment. Dr.SCHULTZ Astonishing. Please come inside Fraulein. She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says, He gives her a pleasant smile. Dr.SCHULTZ They call you Hildi, but your real name is Broomhilda, isn't it?
F	BROOMHILDA	Yes. How do you know that? Dr.SCHULTZ Stands to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name. Can I pour you a glass of water, Broomhilda? Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins Dr.SCHULTZ I'm aware you haven't spoken German in a long while. So I'll talk slowly. I'm only speaking German to you now, Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are listening to us. Myself and a mutual friend of ours, have gone through a lot of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to find you fraulein - to rescue you. He hands her a tall clear glass of water. She looks at him weird, rescue me? Dr.SCHULTZ Please drink. She absentmindedly obeys. Dr.SCHULTZ intention to take you away from here forever. I don't got any friends. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes you do. Who? Dr.SCHULTZ I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a flair for the dramatic, and he wants to surprise you. Where is he? He points at the adjoining door. Dr.SCHULTZ Standing right behind that door. Her head moves in the direction of the door. He looks to the young woman; Dr.SCHULTZ Promise me you won't scream? She nods her head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Say, I promise. I promise. Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it. The door slowly opens revealing... Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
M	DJANGO	Hey Little Trouble Maker. Obviously a pet name between them. Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock... .first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and .followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint. The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other; You silver tongued devil you.
M	MONTAGE	The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django, The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
M	STEPHEN	What you. whistlin', girl? Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.
M	STEPHEN	What was you whistlin'?
F	BROOMHILDA	Oh nuttin'.
M	STEPHEN	You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?
F	BROOMHILDA	I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know no.name. )/Z
M	STEPHEN	It's kinder pretty. She doesn't say anything in return.
M	STEPHEN	That was a compliment.
F	BROOMHILDA	Thank you. Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.
M	STEPHEN	I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in such misery here, you hadda run off. So you run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back. Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here you are two days later, whistlin' while you work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout. .I'm jus' sayin'. He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.
F	BROOMHILDA	I'm done here, may I be excused?
M	STEPHEN	Yes you may. She moves off to another part of the house. Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even Dr.SCHULTZ Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it. But the best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie, and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he called Eskimo Joe?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one day he said he was cold.. .who knows? Dr.SCHULTZ Irregardless, we all know Samson's your best, and you'll never sell him and I can see why, he's a champion.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	All three are champions. Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;
M	DJANGO	Samson's the champion. The other two are pretty good. All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
M	LARA LEE	Hildi! Broomhilda snaps back. Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as long as you don't put 'em up against those two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.
M	DJANGO	Maybe. The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that. Dr.SCHULTZ You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight game, I do have a bit of a background in the European traveling circus. Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation. I need something more then just a big nigger. He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship. I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules. for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ... but is he right as rain ... ? Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game. A nigger that can win fights. That should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern. After you have that, and you know you have that, then, you can start to implement a grande design. But since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table status - beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise, first things first. Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	I see you two gettin' on? Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin; Dr.SCHULTZ .Famously. Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear you native tongue for four years.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston. Everybody at the table chuckles. Dr.SCHULTZ I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion. As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
M	LARA LEE	I don't know doctor, you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for Django. Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three, .STEPHEN sees it. Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook. Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished a drink in this house in twenty years.
M	STEPHEN	When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes a COLD drink. Chuckle... . chuckle...
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Did you overhear that joke I said about me spending two weeks in Boston You don't have any idea the work I do to see food gets on the table. What does that hafta do with the price of Tea in China?
M	STEPHEN	You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got nothin' better to do then listen in here to you tellin' unfunny jokes? Chuckle... . chuckle... What? They laughed!
M	STEPHEN	Of course they laughed, their parents raised them right. When they're a guest in somebody's house, and the master of of the house thinks he's- funny, you suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to. Chuckle... .chuckle... They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	No it was really funny, wasn't it?
M	STEPHEN	Now what do you expect these people to say? What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest. Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being polite, I understand, you mean well, but it just encourages him. Chuckle-chuckle... As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.
M	STEPHEN	You know that nigger? /ï¿½ She spins around. Who?
M	STEPHEN	Don't stall me bitch, you know who?
F	BROOMHILDA	At the table? I don't know him.
M	STEPHEN.	You don't know him?
F	BROOMHILDA	No.
M	STEPHEN	You wouldn't lie to me now, would you? She shakes her head, no. Stephen looks at her skeptical.
M	STEPHEN	Okay, if you say so.
M	BACK TO DINNER TABLE	Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.
M	DJANGO	Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it. But if it was my money, I wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars for him. Dr.SCHULTZ What would your price be?
M	DJANGO	Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,. and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe. Candie's lawyer chimes in.
M	MOGUY	But the real question is, not how much he cost, but how much he can earn? Dr.SCHULTZ Django?
M	DJANGO	In a years time, seven or eight fights - outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland pedigree weren't well known - Virginia... Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty one thousand dollars.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way you cut that cake, that spells profit. Not to, mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger. However let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about. It wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger, it was you who approached me to buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about, ain't too far off from right. And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I could sell 'em any day of the week. But like you said in Greenville doctor, I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it. Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says; Dr.SCHULTZ You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess the power of persuasion. Candie smiles at that remark. Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says; Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars! The White people at the table get very happy. Dr.Schultz continues; Dr.SCHULTZ However, that is a tremendous amount of money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy, I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw up a legal contract before I would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh. Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing. So say I return in about five days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Splendid. Stephen, time for dessert! Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the Broomhilda goes to Calvin.
F	BROOMHILDA	Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Yes you may, Hildi. She begins gathering the dirty dishes. Candie looks up at her as she works.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	So Hildi, how you like servin at the big table in the big house?
F	BROOMHILDA	I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	It's a lot better then sizzling in that hot box, or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush, ain't it?
F	BROOMHILDA	Yes 'em. With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up. Stephen clocks this. Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.
M	STEPHEN	You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled" back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers where he from. When you was alone with Hildi here, didja just speak German, or did ya git her clothes off? Dr.SCHULTZ We just spoke.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	So you haven't seen her back? Dr.SCHULTZ No I haven't.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Then Stephen's right, you would probably find this interesting. Hildi, take off your dress, and show us your back. Django hears this. Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django. Stephen clocks it.
M	LARA LEE	Calvin, I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf, they don't got niggers there. And he's a man of medicine. I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain. I mean Hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers are tough, no doubt about it.
M	LARA LEE	Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less. Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back. Django continues to watching this play out. Stephen watches him. Candie folds.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner. During the brandies. Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;
M	STEPHEN	I thought you said you didn't know him? Broomhilda turns around.
F	BROOMHILDA	Huh? Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.
M	STEPHEN	I said, you said, you didn't know him?
F	BROOMHILDA	I don't.
M	STEPHEN	Yes you do.
F	BROOMHILDA	Mister Stephen, I don't.
M	STEPHEN	Why you lyin to me? As tears begin to well in her eyes.
M	BROOMBILDA	I ain't.
M	STEPHEN	Why you cryin'?
F	BROOMHILDA	Because you're scarin' me.
M	STEPHEN	Why am I scarin' you?
F	BROOMHILDA	Because you're scary. Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say; .to speak German,with Hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching. Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.
M	1ZL	His eyes to to Broomhilda.
M	STEPHEN	You, stay in the kitchen. Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches Dr.SCHULTZ You indicated earlier you would be willing to part with Hildi?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Yes siree bob I did. Dr.SCHULTZ Well in that case allow me to propose another proposition? In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
M	STEPHEN	- Monsieur Candie?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.
M	STEPHEN	Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin' ain't worth a damn these days. Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in the kitchen.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What, you mean get outta my chair?
M	STEPHEN	If you could manage it. It's about dessert.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What about dessert?
M	STEPHEN	I would rather tell you in private.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there? Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;
M	STEPHEN	Meet me in the library. Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily. Stephen exits. Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well as you can see, talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required. If you'll excuse me a moment. Candie exits.
M	TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT	A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What's the matter?
M	STEPHEN	Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos. They want that girl. -
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What the hell you talkin' about?
M	STEPHEN	They playin your ass for a fool, that's what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for that girl.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	What girl, Hildi?
M	STEPHEN	Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	He just bought Eskimo Joe.
M	STEPHEN	Did he give you any money?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Well not yet, but -
M	STEPHEN	- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no how. But he was just about to buy, who he came here to buy, when I interrupted him. Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Where you gettin' all this? Why would they go through all that trouble, to. buy a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth five hundred dollars?
M	STEPHEN	Well they're doin' it cause Django's in love with Hildi. She's probably his wife. Now why that German gives a fuck about who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	If she's who they want, why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos?
M	STEPHEN	Because you wouldn't pay no never mind to four hundred dollar. But twelve thousand got you real friendly. Calvin thinks ... .as per usual, Stephen's right.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin' sonsabitches! Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we .gonna have us a Candyland tar and feathering! FL5
M	STEPHEN	Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy seein' something like that ... . but why don't you sit down and let's talk about this.
M	CALVIN CANDLE	I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin' huckster insinuate themselves at my dinner table, and play this whole goddamn plantation for a fool!
M	STEPHEN	Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's discuss this. A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.
M	STEPHEN	Now look, you knew, and I knew, there was something up with these two. We just didn't know what. But now we do. They don't want you to know how bad they want that girl. But these ole boys have rode a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull to get this girl. They must want her mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin' changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done changed is the advantage. Now we got it. .So let's go back in there and busts these motherfucker's chops. Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon
M	LARA LEE	There you are! I was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together. Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
M	CALVIN CANDLE	That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it Lara Lee? Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda. Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys. Would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball. That of boy knows everything to know 'bout mandingos, But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'. Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder? Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now lay your palms flat on the table top. They put their palms on the table.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off. There's been a lotta lies said around this table tonight-but that.. .you can believe. Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips? Mr.Moguy does. Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right? Dr.SCHULTZ Right. Stephen! Bring out Hildi! Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding Django and Schultz react.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now it should be quite clear by now I know you're not here to buy no mandingos. Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me to know how much you want 'er. So instead, you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe horseshit. Stephen, put her in that chair. Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair. Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed.. You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville, Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve thousand dollars." Now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger." And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars. Dr.SCHULTZ I take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating. Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda is my property. And I can do anything with my property I so desire. He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making IN
M	CALVIN CANDIE	And if you think my price for this nigger is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do is, take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it. Right in front of both y'all. He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price. Dr.SCHULTZ May I lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Yes you may. Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit Dr.SCHULTZ Easy come, easy go. He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Pleasure doin' business with you. INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE. Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed. All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a Rhubarb pie? Schultz looks at the pie and the man. Dr.SCHULTZ No.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan. And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this. Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Dumas...? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers." I figured you must be an admirer. You named your slave after that novel's lead character. If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would of made of it?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You doubt he'd approve? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Soft hearted Frenchy? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas is black. Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two Dr.SCHULTZ We got it, let's go. Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say, auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till I see you again, and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir, I say, goodbye. Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	One more moment, Doc! Dr.SCHULTZ What?
M	CALVIN CANDIE	It's a custom here in the South, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. It implies good faith. Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not from the South. He turns to leave.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid I must insist. This turns Schultz around. Dr.SCHULTZ Insist what...? That I shake your hand before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction. Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	You know what I think you are? Dr.SCHULTZ What you think I am? No I don't.
M	CALVIN CANDLE	I think you are a bad loser. Dr.SCHULTZ And I think you're an abysmal winner.
M	CALVIN CANDLE	Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands. Even after all this paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand. Dr.SCHULTZ If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars...? I don't think so. Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda. Dr.SCHULTZ Let's go.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand. Cut 'er down. Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
M	CANDLE;	Dr.SCHULTZ. You really want me to shake your hand? Django gets it.
M	CALVIN CANDIE	I insist.
M	DR	-Schultz smiles. Well, if you insist. Django goes to stop him... The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand... The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand... He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart. Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he Everybody is stunned. Schultz looks to Django. Django looks back. Dr.SCHULTZ I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face Django begins to come to ... Act like you still sleepin'.
M	DJANGO	Where's Broomhilda?
M	TIMMY	Who?
M	DJANGO	Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago. They had her in The Hot Box.
M	TIMMY	I don't know 'bout no girl.
M	DJANGO	How 'bout that German white man I came here with?
M	TIMMY	Oh he's dead. His body's over there. Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
M	ACE WOODY	Git on outta here, boy! Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
M	ACE WOODY	So y'all bounty hunters,.huh? Django thinks, "How does he know?"
M	ACE WOODY	I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all. We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that line of work? Django retorts, upside down.
M	DJANGO	Well, it turns out I was a natural. Ace woody laughs.
M	ACE WOODY	Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you. Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
M	ACE WOODY	See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure 'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken, everyone 'round here blames you. Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
M	ACE WOODY	Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty. However ... . I don't think you're gonna be able to attend. Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT... . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
M	ACE WOODY	Now I understand you didn't really have nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted to git your girl, and hightail your nigger asses outta here. Now I appreciate that. But grieving folks 'round here need someone to blame. And I guess they figure if you hadn't brought your black ass 'round here in the first place, Boss Man still be alive. And you know what, they got a point. He THROWS the knife again... .this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
M	ACE WOODY	Now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways, believe me when I. tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out there try an' git creative with the way they bust ass. But me... .I always found the best methods are, tried and true. He THROWS the knife again... Django JERKS his head back ... .and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
M	ACE WOODY	You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years training Calvin's mandingos I made me more money I made my whole goddamn life. And no end in sight, neither. Then you came along. Knocked me right off that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in mandingos as her brother? Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think, is you done fucked up my good thang. So when it comes to you, Django boy, you could say I gotta axe to grind.
M	IJS	He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
M	ACE WOODY	How's the blade of that Bowie feel against your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp. Django dances some more ...
M	ACE WOODY	Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts. On the count of three. Got to do it, boy. TWO... Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
M	STEPHEN	Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna talk about the Old Man's funeral. Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin' Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint Dickey people. While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;
M	ACE WOODY	Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me. Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion How disappointing. Where she at?
M	STEPHEN	She in the big house. The kitchen. Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.
M	ACE WOODY	You gonna look after our friend? As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;
M	STEPHEN	Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am! 01' Snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know, gonna have us a big of chat. He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END
M	STEPHEN	Snowballs just makin' sure his talking stick is all nice and FROSTY. Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn. With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
M	STEPHEN	I bet you an' that German thought y'all was on easy street for awhile - didn't ya? Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man. You get the idea to go to Greenville - look up the Ole Man there. That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser. Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking Big House. And that's where you met me. And that's when you knew your goose was cooked. He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
M	STEPHEN	Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours didn't know what's what. He still thought his ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly you are, you always know the end is near 'fore the white folks. With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
M	STEPHEN	Damn Nigger, you smell good. He walks behind Django with the poker.
M	STEPHEN	You know, when you was sittin' on that feather bed in the quest room in the Big House - After you slapped my ass to the floor You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT. Remember that, Bright Boy? He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE Django SCREAMS! Stephen LAUGHS. Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
M	STEPHEN	You leavin', that's what you can take with you. Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
M	STEPHEN	Now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours. Seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life, was comin' up with different ways to kill your ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say; "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're, "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs." And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that? We do that shit all the time. Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that." He stops massaging Django's balls.
M	STEPHEN	So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin' your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company. And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, hence forth, till the day you die, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day, every day, turning big rocks into little rocks. And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be 'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more. Like them three y'all came back with. For them big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last 'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you, I give two or three. Stephen turns to leave.
M	DJANGO	Where's Broomhilda?
M	STEPHEN	She's all right for now. Miss Lara soft hearted on 'er. She gave her to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er. Now Billy Crash might not look or smell too good, but ain't nobody gonna bother her. Stephen limps away. The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
M	ROY	It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot the big boss. Let's git the niggers and git out. The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
M	FLOYD	You blacks line up. They do.
M	FLOYD	What's your names?
M	CHESTER	Chester.
M	CHICKEN CHARLY	Chicken Charly.
M	RODNEY	Rodney.
M	FLOYD	I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano. What's that?
M	CHESTER	It's my stuff.
M	FLOYD	All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
M	FLOYD	You won't be doin' much smokin' mate. You are now the property of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage. This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace Hold on, we got another hammer swinger for ya. Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
M	ROY	We can't use that skinny bastard.
M	ACE WOODY	We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take punishment niggers from time to time.
M	ROY	No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.
M	ACE WOODY	Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.
M	ROY	Look, no one tole' me 'bout -
M	ACE WOODY	- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss Candie killed. And we want his ass punished. Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey how and why you fucked up our nice little business relationship, take this nigger and hush up about it!
M	ROY	Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage. Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
M	DJANGO	Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there with them. They'll kill me. What about all that -turning big rocks into little rocks- shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was the idea ain't it? You put me in there with them big ass garboons they kill me on the way. I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea, but I didn't think that was the idea. Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.
M	ACE WOODY	He can't go in there with them.
M	FLOYD	Why not?
M	ACE WOODY	They'll kill him.
M	FLOYD	I don't give a damn.
M	ACE WOODY	Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man, we want the mine to grind him to gravel!
M	ROY	Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this black and make sure he keeps up.
M	JANO	Oh, I'll keep 'em up. Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland. The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County. Hey boy! Jano ignores him.
M	DJANGO	I said, hey white boy!
M	JANO	Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got nothing to say I wanna hear.
M	DJANGO	What's he pay you?
M	JANO	Who?
M	DJANGO	LeQuint Dickey?
M	JANO	You gotta few more things to worry about black boy, then what I get paid.
M	DJANGO	I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious. I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, ain't I?
M	JANO	Yeah.
M	DJANGO	And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, dont'cha?
M	JANO	Yeah?
M	DJANGO	Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid, how much you gettin' paid? I mean like for instance, how much you gettin' paid for today?
M	JANO	Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey paid for our passage from Australia to here. We get a little money to send back home, and pay him back for the boat trip.
M	DJANGO	How long you been here?
M	JANO	'bout two years.
M	DJANGO	And you ain't paid him back yet? No, not yet! You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought your ass for the price of a boat ride. At least they didn't charge us for our boat ride ... . ha ha ha ha... You shut up! Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
M	DJANGO	How'd you like to make eleven thousand dollars?
M	JANO	What? Django steps closer to him.
M	DJANGO	How would you like to make eleven thousand dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred, actually? Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;
M	ROY	Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black, and keep up!
M	DJANGO	Keep riding, just ride slower. They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.
M	DJANGO	Back at that plantation Candyland, there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode right past it.
M	JANO	You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.
M	DJANGO	That's what's nice about this fortune, it's not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta earn it.
M	JANO	If you got something to say, say it.
M	DJANGO	The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.
M	JANO	Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
M	DJANGO	Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang. There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices, Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons. And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back there at Candyland...laughin their ass off... cause they just got away with murder. But it don't hafta be that way. You and your mates could get that money.
M	JANO	Who pays the money?
M	DJANGO	The Court.
M	JANO	The Court?
M	DJANGO	The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by the way, the court don't give a damn about how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the back, from up on a hill, in the back of the head, in their sleep - don't matter. DJANGO Court doesn't care how you do it, just as long as you do it.
M	JANO	They.pay us to kill 'em?
M	DJANGO	No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the corpse. Get it?
M	JANO	I think so... . what did these jokers do again?
M	DJANGO	Killed innocent people in a stagecoach robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket. Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
M	JANO	What's this?
M	DJANGO	I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang. Jano looks at the handbill.
M	DJANGO	Whatsamatter, can't you read?
M	JANO	I can read, I just don't have my glasses. I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.
M	DJANGO	What about that cowboy fella in the lead?
M	JANO	Roy?
M	DJANGO	Can Roy read?
M	JANO	Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin read. I just don't got my glasses. The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
M	IN THE CAGE	Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
M	DJANGO	I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter. Yesterday as a free man, I rode into Candyland on a horse with my white German partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am. You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you know I'm not suppose to be on this trip. But those four men, are still back there. They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs. And the last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back and gittin it. Django is damn convincing.
M	ROY	What's your deal? You tell us who they are and we let ya go?
M	DJANGO	I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred, and I'll point 'em out to you. He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs 1Q7
M	DJANGO	Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put me in the same cage with them without them killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them .am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?
M	ROY AND FLOYD	go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk, "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall. One thousand five hundred dollars for each of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.
M	FLOYD	Just because the handbill's real doesn't mean that other bunch of malarky.is.
M	ROY	Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket? Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.
M	ROY	That black's damn convincing. They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;
M	ROY	That black ride into Candyland yesterday? The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
M	ROY	I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man yesterday?
M	CHESTER	Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville Auction and he rode on a horse with a white man.
M	ROY	This white man, was the black his slave?
M	RODNEY	He weren't no slave.
M	FLOYD	You sure about that?
M	RODNEY	Damn sure. Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
M	ROY	What happened at Candyland?
M	CHICKEN CHARLY	Bunch of shootin, master got shot.
M	ROY	Who shot 'em?
M	CHICKEN CHARLY	The German.
M	ROY	And why did he do that?
M	CHICKEN CHARLY	The nigger and the German were actin as if they were slavers, but they weren't.

M	ROY	They wouldn't go by their outlaw names you idiot! Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.
M	ROY	Okay black, you gotta deal. Jano reacts.
M	DJANGO	I got one more condition.
M	ROY	What?
M	DJANGO	When we get there, when the time comes, you let me help you kill 'em. Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists. You got a deal, black. Django interrupts -

Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;
M	DJANGO	Where's my pistol?
M	ROY	Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give 'em your gun and your belt. Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;
M	FLOYD	Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights fixed last month, it's perfect. Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.
M	DJANGO	That's good to know. Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE Roy turns around... Django takes the gun out of the holster... Jano goes for the gun on his hip. Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!! The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...

Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

M	DJANGO	You know what toadstools look like?
M	TIMMY	Sure do.
M	DJANGO	Go pick me a mess of 'em. INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS). Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt. He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel. The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.
M	DJANGO	You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that. Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.
M	DJANGO	First things first, boy. Take me to my horse. The funeral is in full melodramatic bore. Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes

She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
M	CU BROOMHILDA	Her face, stained with tears, watches the door. Yes? The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;
M	DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)	Hey Little Trouble Maker. She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...
