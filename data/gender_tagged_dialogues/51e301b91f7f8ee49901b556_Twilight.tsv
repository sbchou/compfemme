F	BELLA	Who are they?
F	ANGELA	The Cullens.
F	JESSICA	Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.
F	ANGELA	They kinda keep to themselves.
F	JESSICA	Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.. ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it.
F	JESSICA	... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.
F	ANGELA	Jess, they're not actually related.
F	JESSICA	But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird..
F	JESSICA	... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. I mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker.

F	BELLA	That'd be great, thank you.
F	BELLA	So... you eat here every night?
M	CHARLIE	Easier than washing dishes.
F	BELLA	I can cook.
F	BELLA	I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.
M	CHARLIE	I remember.. They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner.
M	CHARLIE	How was school? Meet anyone? A few people... Do you know the Cullen family?
M	CHARLIE	Are people talking about them again?
F	BELLA	No... well, a little.
M	CHARLIE	Just cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like a lot of the hell-raisers around here.
F	BELLA	... Okay.

F	BELLA	You were next to your car, across the lot. No, I wasn't.
F	BELLA	Yes. You were.
M	EDWARD	You're confused. You hit your head.
F	BELLA	I know what I saw.
M	EDWARD	And what, exactly, was that?
F	BELLA	You stopped that van. You pushed it away.
M	EDWARD	No one will believe that.
F	BELLA	I wasn't planning to tell anyone.
F	BELLA	I just want to know the truth.
M	EDWARD	Can't you just thank me and get over it?
F	BELLA	Thank you. A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and

F	BELLA	Hello, Edward.
F	BELLA	Really?
M	EDWARD	What's in Jacksonville?
F	BELLA	How did you know about that?
M	EDWARD	You didn't answer my question.
F	BELLA	You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.
M	EDWARD	Hello.
F	BELLA	And how did you stop that van?
M	EDWARD	Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it. BELLA Floridians. That's what's in Jacksonville.
M	EDWARD	It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
M	EDWARD	I know I've been rude, but it's for the best.
F	JESSICA	Guess who just asked me to prom!
F	JESSICA	I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird?
F	BELLA	No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.
F	JESSICA	I know, right?
M	EDWARD	Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends. Too bad you didn't figure that out earlier. You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret.
M	EDWARD	You think I regret saving you?
F	BELLA	I know you do.
M	EDWARD	You don't know anything.
F	ALICE	The bus is leaving. Hi. Will you be riding with us?
M	EDWARD	No. Our bus is full.
M	CHARLIE	Your mother called. Again.
F	BELLA	Your fault, for telling her about the accident.
M	CHARLIE	She always did know how to worry. But... she's changed, too. She seems happy. Phil sounds all right.
F	BELLA	He is. ERIC La Push, baby. You in?
F	BELLA	Should I know what that means?
M	MIKE	La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We're all going after school. Big swell coming in.
M	ERIC	And I don't just surf the internet.
F	JESSICA	Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board.
F	ANGELA	There's whale watching, too. Come with.
M	ERIC	La Push, baby.
F	BELLA	I'll go if you stop saying that.
M	EDWARD	Edible art.. Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches
F	BELLA	Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.
M	EDWARD	I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be. BELLA What does that even mean?
M	EDWARD	It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me.
F	BELLA	So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?
M	EDWARD	Probably not. I'd rather hear your theories.
F	BELLA	Okay... how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?
M	EDWARD	You're talking about superheroes. What if I'm not a hero? What if I'm a bad guy?
F	BELLA	No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away. Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes..
M	EDWARD	Which beach?
F	BELLA	La Push. His smile lessens almost imperceptibly.
F	BELLA	Is something wrong with that beach?
M	EDWARD	It's just a little crowded.
F	ANGELA	I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just... doesn't.
F	BELLA	You could ask him. Take control. You're a strong independent woman.
F	ANGELA	I am? Bella!
F	BELLA	Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?
M	JACOB	You're on my rez, remember? You surfing?
F	BELLA	Definitely not.
F	JESSICA	Keep her company. Her date bailed.
M	ERIC	What date? JESSICA She invited Edward.
F	BELLA	To be polite.
F	ANGELA	I think it's nice she invited him. No one ever does.
M	MIKE	Because Cullen's a freak.
M	SAM	You got that right.
F	BELLA	You know them?
M	SAM	The Cullens don't come here.
F	BELLA	You want to go look at tide pools? So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?
M	JACOB	Oops. Caught that, huh?
M	JACOB	I'm not supposed to say anything.
F	BELLA	I can keep a secret.. JACOB It's just an old scary story. Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
F	BELLA	Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? So the legend about the Cullens is..
M	JACOB	Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like.. claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them.
F	BELLA	Didn't they just move here?
M	JACOB	Or just moved back.
F	BELLA	Riiiight. So what was this treaty? If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces.. Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past,

Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time. You never eat food, or drink, or come out in the sunlight. And you said no to the beach trip only after you heard where it was. Because of the treaty.
F	BELLA	How old are you?
M	EDWARD	Seventeen.
F	BELLA	How long have you been seventeen?
M	EDWARD	... A while.
M	THEM FASTER	
F	BELLA	I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.
M	EDWARD	Say it. Out loud. Say it. ... Vampire
M	EDWARD	Are you afraid?
F	BELLA	No. EDWARD Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?
F	BELLA	You won't hurt me. You're different.
M	EDWARD	You think you know me?
F	BELLA	Where are we going?
M	EDWARD	Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what I really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.
F	BELLA	No! The sunlight will kill you. Myth. You need to see the truth.
F	BELLA	Slow down.
M	EDWARD	Are you afraid?
F	BELLA	No.
M	EDWARD	Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where I could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.
F	BELLA	I'm not afraid. EDWARD He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms.
M	EDWARD	Hold on.
M	EDWARD	Are you afraid! No!
F	BELLA	Edward? Where are you? EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some
M	a	deep breath, and steps out of the shade This is why we don't show ourselves As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if This is what I am. You're... beautiful.. He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. This is the skin of a killer.
F	BELLA	I don't believe that.
M	EDWARD	Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that.. He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by
M	a	tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands
M	EDWARD	As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off. tree trunk with explosive force.
M	EDWARD	I'm designed to kill.
F	BELLA	I don't care.
M	EDWARD	I've killed people.
F	BELLA	It doesn't matter. EDWARD I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you. I trust you.
M	EDWARD	Don't.
F	BELLA	I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
F	BELLA	Edward?
M	EDWARD	You... took me by surprise. I don't know how to... do this.
M	EDWARD	Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.. But you - your scent, it's like a drug to me... my own personal brand of heroin.
F	BELLA	Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
M	EDWARD	I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.
F	BELLA	I know you can. He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her
M	EDWARD	I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes.. I can't read your mind. Tell me what you're thinking.
F	BELLA	I'm afraid.
M	EDWARD	Good.
F	BELLA	Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you. You don't know how long I've looked for you. EDWARD Be very still. They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.
M	EDWARD	And so the lion fell for the lamb.
F	BELLA	Stupid lamb.
M	EDWARD	Sick masochistic lion. CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as About three things I was absolutely positive. One, Edward was
M	a	vampire. Two, there was a part of him that thirsted for my blood. And three.. As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY ... I was falling, unconditionally and irrevocably, in love with him.
F	BELLA	How long have you been like this?
M	EDWARD	Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.
F	BELLA	Where'd he find you?
M	EDWARD	In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died. FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT What was it like? The word excruciating comes to mind. But what Carlisle did was much harder... not many of us have the restraint to do that. Didn't he just... bite?
M	EDWARD	Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of.. frenzy begins. It's almost impossible to stop. But Carlisle did.
M	EDWARD	First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed.
F	BELLA	Does someone have to be dying to become like you?.. Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to
M	EDWARD	... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice.
F	BELLA	So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people.
M	EDWARD	Not the only reason. EDWARD I don't want to be a monster.
M	EDWARD	We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying.
F	BELLA	Show off.
M	EDWARD	It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this.
F	BELLA	Can they all read minds, too?
M	EDWARD	No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future. Really? Bet she saw me coming
M	a	mile away.
M	EDWARD	Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.
M	EDWARD	Come to my house tomorrow.
F	BELLA	Your house? With your family? He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it
F	BELLA	But... what if they don't like me? You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you?
F	BELLA	I'm glad I amuse you.
F	BELLA	What is it?
M	EDWARD	A complication.
M	EDWARD	I'll pick you up tomorrow. Come to visit your truck?
M	JACOB	Looks good. You got that dent out.
M	BILLY	Actually, we came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again. JACOB Great, Dad. Thanks.
M	CHARLIE	Pale Ale.
M	BILLY	Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry. Any luck with the Waylon case? Found a footprint out at the crime scene today. A bare, human footprint.
F	BELLA	A person did that?
M	JACOB	A crazy person, walking around barefoot this time of year.
M	CHARLIE	Spread the word out at the rez, will ya? Keep the kids out of the woods.
M	BILLY	Will do. Don't want no one else getting hurt. Suddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD! Something has him, SMASH TO: -- as her eyes pop open... and relief sweeps over her as she A timeless graceful house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella It's... wonderful.
M	EDWARD	You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside. Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house. Walls of glass BELLA It's so light and open. Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide. EDWARD I told them not to do this. Bella. We're making Italiano for EDWARD This is Esme, my mother for all
F	BELLA	Bon giorno?
F	ESME	Molto bene! You've given us an excuse to use PAN across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the
F	ESME	I hope you're hungry.
F	BELLA	Oh, absolutely
M	EDWARD	She already ate. ROSALIE Perfect.
F	BELLA	I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know..
F	ESME	Of course. That was very considerate of you.
M	EDWARD	Ignore her. I do.
F	ROSALIE	Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us.
F	BELLA	I would never, ever tell anyone.
F	DR. CULLEN	She knows that.
M	EMMETT	The problem is, you two have gone public now, so.. Emmett.
F	ROSALIE	No, she should know. The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.
F	BELLA	... Badly? Oh. Badly. Like, where I become
M	a	meal. Hi, Bella! I'm Alice. You do smell good. EDWARD Alice. ALICE to be great friends.
F	BELLA	And you're Jasper, right?
M	JASPER	Pleasure to meet you.
F	ALICE	You won't hurt her, Jasper.
M	EDWARD	I'll give you a tour of the house.
F	ALICE	I'll see you soon.
F	BELLA	Graduation caps?
M	EDWARD	A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
F	BELLA	What a nightmare, repeating high school. EDWARD True, but the younger we start out in a new place, the longer we can stay there. ... and this is my room. track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up.
F	BELLA	So you're obsessed with music. But.. No bed?
M	EDWARD	No sleep.
F	BELLA	Ever?
M	EDWARD	No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.
M	EDWARD	Do you have any favorites?
F	BELLA	Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.. Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.
F	BELLA	I'd have to say... Debussy.
M	EDWARD	My favorite, too. solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to play. He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her
F	BELLA	No dancing.
M	EDWARD	Ever?
F	BELLA	No tripping, no falling, no derision.
M	EDWARD	I can always make you.
F	BELLA	You don't scare me.
M	EDWARD	You really shouldn't have said that.
F	BELLA	Don't you dare - IN A TREE - in his arms. When she realizes where she is, she
F	ESME	She's brought him to life.
F	DR. CULLEN	He's been alone too long... but how can it end well?
F	ESME	Alice has been wrong before. DR. CULLEN Not often. Carlisle. Bella is what he wants.
M	EDWARD	Trust me?
F	BELLA	In theory.
M	EDWARD	Then close your eyes.
M	EDWARD	Open. Monte Carlo? That's our prom
M	ERIC	Gambling, tuxedos and - Bond. James -- ow! ANGELA Oh. My. God. Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen. Jessica and Eric
M	BELLA AND EDWARD	-- arriving together. All eyes on campus are turning to BELLA Everyone's staring.
M	EDWARD	Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile.. CLOSE ON A GERMAN SHEPHERD 89 Moving fast, tracking. INCLUDE CHARLIE holding the leash --It's a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men.
M	CHARLIE	Guys, we got something The Deputies hurry to Charlie. They gather around A FOOTPRINT. The dogs start pulling them in a certain UNKNOWN POV - ON CHARLIE, FROM A DISTANCE JAMES - ATOP A KNOLL, WATCHING THEM Laurent stands next to him. Victoria jogs up.
F	VICTORIA	They took the bait.
M	JAMES	By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg.
F	VICTORIA	I love when men chase me. He grins, then starts taking off her clothes. They pull each
M	MIKE	Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.
F	BELLA	Sorry I'm late. Biology project.
M	CHARLIE	Ordered you the seafood combo.
F	BELLA	Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak.
M	CHARLIE	I'm healthy as a horse. Say Chief, boys want to know, you find anything down by Queets River today?
M	CHARLIE	The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on.
F	CORA	Hope they catch him fast.
M	CHARLIE	Your friends are flagging you. She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside,
M	CHARLIE	It's okay you wanna join them. I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.
F	BELLA	Yeah, me, too. It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons.
F	BELLA	He's just a friend.
M	CHARLIE	None of the boys in town interest you?
F	BELLA	We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?
M	CHARLIE	Just... you should be around people. I leave you alone too much. I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a lot like my dad that way. Berry cobbler, two forks.
F	BELLA	So spring training's going well? Phil's working hard. We're looking around for a house to rent, in case it becomes permanent. You'd like Jacksonville, baby.
F	BELLA	Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.
F	RENE	Could... a guy have something to do with that?
F	BELLA	Maybe..
F	RENE	Tell me everything! Jock? Indie? Bet he's smart. Is he smart?
F	BELLA	Well... he is kind of a history buff.
F	BELLA	I, uh... have to go.
F	RENE	No way, we gotta talk boys. Are you being safe?
F	BELLA	I'll call you later, Mom.
F	BELLA	How did you get in here?
M	EDWARD	The window. As always.
F	BELLA	You've been here before? What else is there to do at night? She pushes him. He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her
F	BELLA	You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
M	EDWARD	Shh! The Chief will hear you!
M	EDWARD	I just... like watching over you.
M	EDWARD	There's something I'd like to try. What neither of them is prepared for is her response. Her
F	BELLA	Oh... I'm... oh.
M	EDWARD	I'm stronger than I thought.
F	BELLA	Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed.
M	EDWARD	Don't be. But we have to be careful. I can never lose control with you. Ever.
F	BELLA	I have a date with Edward Cullen.
M	CHARLIE	He's too old for you.
F	BELLA	We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.
M	CHARLIE	And I thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.
F	BELLA	Edward doesn't live in town. And it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now.
M	CHARLIE	Now? He's out there? He wants to meet you. Officially.
M	CHARLIE	Good.
F	BELLA	Be nice, okay? He's... important.
M	EDWARD	Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.
M	a	hello, resisting him.
M	EDWARD	I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family.
M	CHARLIE	Bella's going to play baseball? EDWARD Yes, sir, that's the plan.
M	CHARLIE	Well. More power to you, I guess.
M	EDWARD	She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.
M	CHARLIE	You got that pepper spray? Dad. Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school.
F	BELLA	No fair, reading Charlie's mind. BELLA And since when do vampires like baseball?
M	EDWARD	It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why. Good thing you're here. We need
M	a	umpire.
M	EMMETT	She thinks we cheat. I know you cheat. Call em as you see em, Bella.
F	ALICE	It's time.
F	BELLA	Now I get why you need the thunder.
F	BELLA	That has to be a home run.
F	ESME	Edward's very fast.
F	BELLA	Yer out?
F	ALICE	Stop! I didn't see them.. They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The
F	ALICE	They're traveling so quickly ROSALIE You said they left the county - ALICE They did, but then they heard us.. And changed their minds.
M	EDWARD	Put your hair down
F	ROSALIE	Like that'll help. I could smell her from across the field.
M	EDWARD	I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.
M	LAURENT	I believe this belongs to you.
F	DR. CULLEN	Thank you.
M	LAURENT	Could you use three more players?
F	DR. CULLEN	Of course.
M	LAURENT	I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. And James.
F	DR. CULLEN	Would you like to bat first? Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James. Laurent
F	DR. CULLEN	I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.
M	LAURENT	Our apologies. We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
F	DR. CULLEN	Yes, we maintain a permanent residence.
M	LAURENT	Really? Well, we won't be a problem any more.
F	VICTORIA	The humans were tracking us, but we led them East- He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella.. CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball JAMES -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt. His head WHIPS
M	JAMES	You brought a snack.
F	DR. CULLEN	The girl is with us. LAURENT We won't harm her.
M	EMMETT	Just try it.
F	DR. CULLEN	I think it best if you leave.
M	LAURENT	Yes, I can see the game is over. We'll go now. James? immediately gathers up the bats- Get Bella out of here. We'll follow them. Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off - -- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around
M	EDWARD	-- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human. I just made this his most exciting game ever. THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD
M	EDWARD	The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there. BELLA What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of us! EDWARD Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow.
F	BELLA	I said, leave me alone!
M	EDWARD	Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please Get out! It's over.
M	CHARLIE	Bella? What happened?
F	BELLA	I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. BELLA I can't hurt him.
M	CHARLIE	Bells. Did he hurt you?
F	BELLA	No, Dad.
M	CHARLIE	Then what? Did he break up with you?
F	BELLA	I broke up with him.
M	CHARLIE	I thought you liked him?
F	BELLA	That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.
M	EDWARD	I'll be in the truck.
M	CHARLIE	Your mother's not even in Phoenix.
F	BELLA	She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.
M	CHARLIE	You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning.
F	BELLA	I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise. Bells, I know I'm not around much, BELLA Like watch more baseball on the flat Bella... I just got you back. And if I don't get out now, I'm He'll forgive you. Slide over.. Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the
F	BELLA	His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.
M	EDWARD	It was the only way he'd let you go.
M	EDWARD	Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the
M	EDWARD	It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.
F	DR. CULLEN	He came to warn us. About James.
M	LAURENT	I've grown tired of his games. But he's got unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I've never seen anything like him in three hundred years ... And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate her. Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic.
M	LAURENT	I'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here. JASPER I've had to fight our kind before. We're hard to kill.
M	EDWARD	But not impossible. We'll tear him up We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces I don't relish killing another creature. Even a sadistic one like James.
F	ROSALIE	If he doesn't get to one of us first. BELLA This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me. Too late.
M	EDWARD	I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away DR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you.
F	ALICE	I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will drive her south. I'll keep her safe, Edward.
M	EDWARD	Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
M	EDWARD	Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent. Why should I? What is she to me? Just a danger you've inflicted on us Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's a part of this family now. And we protect our family. Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together.
F	BELLA	If any of you get hurt because of me
M	EDWARD	We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you.
M	EDWARD	You're my life now. They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV BELLA Mom, it's me again. You must have THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table. Alice looks
F	BELLA	I wish he'd call.
F	ALICE	You should eat.
F	BELLA	They could get hurt. It's not worth it.
M	JASPER	Yes. It is.
M	JASPER	Edward's changed since he found you. And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you. It's worth it. What do you see?
F	ALICE	The tracker. He just changed course.. Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her. Where will it take him, Alice? Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
F	BELLA	How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.
M	JASPER	She sees the course people are on, while they're on it. If they change their minds, the visions change.
F	BELLA	So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio?
F	ALICE	You've been here?
F	BELLA	No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.
M	JASPER	Was your school here in Phoenix?
F	BELLA	Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years.
M	JASPER	Do you have any reason to go now?
F	BELLA	No. Hell, no. I hated the place. BELLA Edward. Are you alright?
M	EDWARD	I'm coming to get you. We lost the tracker. The woman is still in the area. Rosalie and Esme are protecting your father. This is my fault. You warned me, but I didn't think. I just.. Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel.. No... we can't. When will you get here?
M	EDWARD	In a couple hours. Then you and I will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting. Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again.
F	BELLA	Mom, I'm so glad you got my - Bella? Bella? Where are you?
F	BELLA	Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone.
F	BELLA	... Mom? Are you there? Nice house you have here. Not the best on the block, but comfortable.
M	JAMES	I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well. Bella's eyes are wild with fear.
M	JAMES	I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address. Bella? Bella?.. BELLA Leave my mother out of this.
M	JAMES	You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that?
F	BELLA	I... don't think so. If your mother's life depends on it?
F	BELLA	Where should I meet you?
M	JAMES	The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake. She smells like you. Delicious. Her purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper
F	BELLA	8th and Palo Verde, please. I've never given much thought to I love seems like a good way to go.. I can't bring myself to regret the Bella? Bella?
M	A	ballet bar wraps around the walls - Bella, where are you? A T.V. - ON SCREEN A VIDEO PLAYS - Bella, age 7, hides in the Don't you want to dance, baby?
F	BELLA	Everyone makes fun of me.
F	RENE	But you're a wonderful dancer.
F	BELLA	Mom, I suck.
M	JAMES	That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you?
F	BELLA	She's not here.
M	JAMES	Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
M	JAMES	So to make things more entertaining, I'm going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from your house. Hope you don't mind. And... action!
M	JAMES	Excellent! An escape attempt.
M	JAMES	It'll break Edward's little heart.
F	BELLA	Edward has nothing to do with this. He will. His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.
M	JAMES	Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well.
M	JAMES	Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it. Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really.
M	JAMES	Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me.
M	JAMES	Tell Edward how much it hurts. Tell him to avenge you.
F	BELLA	No! Edward, don't.. James inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - ECU ON JAMES' FACE
M	JAMES	Cut! The end.
M	JAMES	You're alone... because you're faster than the others. But not stronger.

F	BELLA	It's burning!
M	EDWARD	What's the other choice? You said Tighter, above the knee
F	DR. CULLEN	You can try to suck the venom out.
M	EDWARD	I -- won't be able to stop Find the will to stop. But choose, she only has minutes left.
M	EDWARD	It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away. CLOSE ON BELLA'S EYES -wild with pain. But subsiding.. CLOSE ON EDWARD'S EYES -the frenzy has begun. He sucks Stop. Her blood is clean, you're killing her. BELLA'S POV -ON EDWARD -growing blurry... he disappears Death is peaceful. Easy. Bella starts to float away... we're losing her.. Suddenly from the darkness, Edward reaches out a hand.. A brilliant light flares.. 134 BELLA'S FACE APPEARS IN THE WHITENESS
F	BELLA	Life... is harder.. An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, You're awake, baby! You're okay!! Bella lies in a hospital bed. Bandaged, leg in a cast. In bad
F	BELLA	Edward? Where's -
F	RENE	He's asleep. She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps. He never leaves. And your dad's down in the cafeteria.
F	BELLA	What... happened?
F	RENE	Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window. RENE Edward came here to convince you to come back to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs. A moment... then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods.
F	BELLA	Sounds like me. Rene's cell phone BEEPS. She opens it. Reads a text, starts
F	RENE	It's Phil. He's worried about you.
F	BELLA	Mom, you're... texting. I told him to stay in Florida. The Suns signed him!
