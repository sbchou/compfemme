M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ANCHORWOMAN	--addressing the United Nations today, the President expressed his concern over the increasingly intense territorial disputes in both Asia and the Middle East.
M	PRESIDENT	The sound of a bullet at one end of the world echoes across the ocean to the other end. Armed conflict is not self contained in its respective region--the consequences reverberate through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at all costs.
M	ANCHORWOMAN	While the President's position was clear, he did not comment on whether or not he would order Dr. Manhattan into action should the situation continue to escalate. With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in
M	BLAKE	Just a matter of time, I suppose. With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake . and starts laughing. Hysterical.
M	BLAKE (CONT'D)	I always thought I knew the punchline. But I guess the joke's on me now. He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment-- . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.
M	COP 1	Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!
M	SHOPKEEPER	It's been over four hours, I got a business to run-- As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.
M	NEWS VENDOR	Depressing ain't it?
M	MAN	But good for business, right?
M	NEWS VENDOR	Yeah. Irony's a bitch. The man pays for a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the
M	HOMELESS MAN	The current issue of The New Frontiersman, where is it?
M	NEWS VENDOR	It's late this month.
M	HOMELESS MAN	When will it be here?
M	NEWS VENDOR	I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late-- We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
M	DET. FINE	Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225. A solid 225, guy was built like a linebacker. This is plate glass too, you'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this. Had to be a two man job. At least. You check the bedroom?
M	DET. GALLAGHER	Drawers were open, tossed through. Mattress flipped.
M	DET. FINE	Robbery?
M	DET. GALLAGHER	Or made to look like one. Found that in the bedroom. Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It
M	DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D)	You see this? He picks up a PHOTO from the floor, hands it to Fine.
M	DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D)	Shaking hands with the President.
M	DET. FINE	You're saying this guy was a spook? You think this might be a political murder?
M	DET. GALLAGHER	I think that this is way bigger than the both of us. He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	Rorschach's Journal, October 12th. Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide. It was later learned to be a homicide. Someone's time was up. Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I discovered a clue. Something I recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly . I heard my own clock ticking. We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time-- Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS, Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly
M	COP 1	You sure it wasn't the wind?
M	COP 2	Nah, I definitely heard something.
M	COP 1	I tell ya, I'd rather do traffic duty than be posted at a crime scene all night. Watch the door. Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than
M	COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Clear! I'm checking the other rooms. Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns-- --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches
M	HOLLIS (O.S.)	See, the Comedian thought he had it all worked out.
M	HOLLIS (O.S.)	He was young and arrogant, but what he lacked in experience, he made up for in . tenacity. As he speaks, we PAN ACROSS various FRAMED MEMORABILIA: The
M	HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Guess I was that way too, when I started. I'll never know what possessed me to put that mask on the first time.
M	HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)	It started with the villains, y'know, people forget that. Pirate outfits, ghosts. Gangs that thought it was funny to dress up and pull heists, crap like that. PAN ACROSS: Another FRAMED CLIPPING, dated 1962: NITE OWL
M	HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)	So a few cops, we decide it might be funny to mask up too. Be anonymous. Take these guys on at the street level, right? Then the media got wind, ran with it, turned it into a whole different beast.
M	HOLLIS (CONT'D)	Superheroes, Supervillians--you know who I ran into the other day at the market? The Screaming Skull. We chatted for a while. Turns out he's a born again.
M	DAN (V.0.)	No way. We see who Hollis is speaking to--DAN DREIBERG (the second
M	HOLLIS	All the nuts that started popping up, I'll tell ya. Who was that midget you and your partner chased down years ago? What'd he call himself?
M	DAN	The Big Figure.
M	HOLLIS	Big Figure. A midget bad guy. Guess it doesn't get lower than that, does it? Hollis laughs at his own joke; Dan chuckles, polite.
M	DAN	Wow, it's really late. Dan stands, finishes his beer. Hollis sees him to the door.
M	HOLLIS	Well, even though I spent my time catching real bad guys, you were still a better Nite Owl than I ever was.
M	DAN	That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it. They hug.
M	HOLLIS	With all this talk of war, all that's going on in the world, it's a shame the government forced all you guys out. Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on
M	ANCHORWOMAN	This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes ten years ago. Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on
M	HOLLIS	Well, forced all of you guys out except one. Next week? Dan nods, then leaves.
M	GANG LEADER	Move your leg.
M	DAN	What?
M	GANG LEADER	I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his
M	DAN	Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN
F	RORSCHACH	Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind?
M	DAN	No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you?
F	RORSCHACH	No need. Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask
M	DAN	You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop.
F	RORSCHACH	Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.
M	DAN	Other than that . How have you been keeping?
F	RORSCHACH	Out of prison. So far. Look at this.
M	DAN	This little stain, is that bean juice or--
F	RORSCHACH	Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead.
M	DAN	The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. Let's talk downstairs.
M	DAN	How did it happen?
F	RORSCHACH	Murder. Someone threw him out a window.
M	DAN	Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was.
F	RORSCHACH	An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.
M	DAN	You're right. I heard he was working for the government. Maybe it was a political killing.
F	RORSCHACH	Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill off costumed heroes.
M	DAN	You don't think that's . a little paranoid?
F	RORSCHACH	Is that what they're saying about me now? That I'm paranoid?
M	DAN	I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man wasn't exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us.
F	RORSCHACH	One of our own has been murdered. I thought you might be interested. An attack on one is an attack on all of us, right? Dan hesitates.
M	DAN	I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've all been out. Except you. You know that.
F	RORSCHACH	Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd let you know. Just in case.
M	DAN	Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL.
F	RORSCHACH	I remember. Used to come here a lot. Back when we were partners.
M	DAN	Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great times. What ever happened to them?
F	RORSCHACH	You quit. Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to
M	HOOKER	So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.
M	ARMY OFFICER	Seeing that I don't have to be back to base till Friday--everything. He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS
F	RORSCHACH	Quiet, whore. Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker quiets to a whimper.
M	DAN	I'm here to see Adrian Veidt.
M	ASSISTANT	Do you have an appointment?
M	DAN	No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him.
M	ASSISTANT	I'm sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn't see anyone without an appointment.
M	DAN	I understand, but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an old friend.
M	ASSISTANT	Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the
M	DAN	Just tell him I'm here. I assure you he'll see me. Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken.
M	ASSISTANT	Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg. --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end
M	DOUG ROTH	Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you are considered the world's smartest man? I think it's better to be the world's most modest man. You should ignore my PR people, they tend to be a little too enthusiastic. Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly
M	DOUG ROTH	If we could move off the subject of business for a moment, I'm curious whether the world's smartest man thinks we're headed for our next World War. Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan.
F	ADRIAN	Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events. I hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions. This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there are no limitations-- --but I talk too much. Will you mind pausing the interview a moment, Doug? A good friend of mine is here. Doug Roth leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat.
M	DAN	You look good, Adrian.
F	ADRIAN	Dan--it's been far too long.
F	ADRIAN	Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.
M	DAN	He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out. Sara can be tough. Is that why you came to see me? You're worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach's conjured up?
M	DAN	You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me.
F	ADRIAN	Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already. Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	No, there are other things in the world I'm far more concerned about. ON THE WALL: The TV projector shows an image of TWO PAKISTANI
M	PAKISTANI SOLDIER	We should attack the Indian bastards. I don't understand--
M	INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)	--why I can't just pull this trigger. We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with
M	INDIAN SOLDIER #2	Because then a battle begins. Then a war. And then the Americans will send--
M	CHINESE CAPTAIN	--their blue abomination to intervene. And we don't want that. At the same time, we can't assume to know what's on the minds of our enemies. We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE
M	AIDE	Is Dr. Manhattan even real?
M	ISRAELI OFFICER	Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god for that. We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army
M	DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)	Good evening, Rorschach. --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the
F	RORSCHACH	Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his
F	LAURIE	Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here? You're a wanted man.
F	RORSCHACH	Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.
F	LAURIE	Don't call me that. My mother made me take that name. I always hated it.
F	RORSCHACH	Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should tell you the bad news--the Comedian has been murdered.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, since he and I are the only two extranormal operatives currently employed by the government, I was informed. The CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic groups. Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He
F	RORSCHACH	I have my own theories. But neither of you seem too concerned.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles. Structurally there's no difference.
F	LAURIE	Well, I might not be able to count molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard. You know he tried to rape my mother?
F	RORSCHACH	Sounds like you may have had a score to settle. You or your mother.
F	LAURIE	What? Are you accusing--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Rorschach, please don't upset Laurie. I
M	DON'T--	He pauses as if he hears something.
M	DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)	Excuse me for a moment. Suddenly he disappears. --when suddenly Dr. Manhattan materializes in a blue flash,
M	MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	It's him He's, he's real. Allah help us, he's real! The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots
M	DR. MANHATTAN	These men were transporting a shipment of enriched uranium-- With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and
M	DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)	I've safely transformed the uranium into sand. I trust you can take things from here. And just like that he disappears--
F	RORSCHACH	--I'm not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country.
F	LAURIE	You call rape a moral discrepancy?!
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I think you ought to go.
F	RORSCHACH	I came here to warn you both, just like I warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone may be targeting masked heroes--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I said you ought to go.
F	RORSCHACH	It took a lot of effort to get in here. I'm not leaving before I've-- With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear.
F	RORSCHACH	--had my say Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his
M	DR. MANHATTAN	He's gone. Are you okay now?
M	YEAH	Are you okay, Jon? Dr. Manhattan pauses for a moment, thoughtful.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm having trouble with my vision. I can't see clearly what lies ahead. There's some static interference.
F	LAURIE	Interference? Caused by what?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm uncertain. A power surge of great magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.
F	LAURIE	More war talk. I can't deal with this. I don't want to think about the future right now.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	There's no such thing as the "future." I've explained to you on many occasions--
F	LAURIE	--that time is simultaneous. There's no past to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes I know. I'm sorry, it's just a little unnerving to be with someone who can see the future, or whatever you call it.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I understand your frustration, Laurie. The human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time frame by frame. Perhaps you'd find it more comforting if you could perceive time as I do Dr. Manhattan touches her head-- She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her
M	LAURIE (V.0.)	Jon, stop!
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I didn't mean to upset you.
F	LAURIE	I know. I think I've been cooped up on this base for too long. Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen him in years. Maybe we can give him a call, see if he's available for dinner tonight.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	You go ahead, Laurie. I want to further investigate this interference with my vision. I find it troubling.
M	AGENT FORBES	Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter?
F	LAURIE	Out.
M	AGENT FORBES	I'll have a car brought around in a few minutes.
F	LAURIE	No, thank you. I called a cab already-- it's waiting for me outside. She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of
M	AGENT FORBES	You look quite nice. Who are you meeting?
F	LAURIE	An old friend of mine. And of Dr. Manhattan's. Now step out of my way.
M	AGENT FORBES	Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that your boyfriend is this country's most valuable asset. You need to keep him happy. And on our side. Laurie glares at him.
F	LAURIE	Yes, sir. She brushes past him as she leaves. We hear the LAUGHTER--
F	LAURIE	You remember that crazy guy, what did he call himself . Captain Carnage! Pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time?
M	DAN	Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, "punish me! punish me!" Whatever happened to him?
M	DAN	Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter.
F	LAURIE	Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't remember the last time I laughed like this. It feels good. Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's
M	DAN	It's great seeing you again, Laurie.
F	LAURIE	Yeah, this was fun. The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it.
M	DAN	You sure I can't get that?
F	LAURIE	Let me put my expense account to use. You can thank Uncle Sam. Laurie nods out the window. Dan turns and sees a GOVERNMENT
M	DAN	They've been watching the whole time?
F	LAURIE	Just making sure I'm not doing anything that might upset the country's most powerful weapon.
M	DAN	How is Jon, by the way?
F	LAURIE	I really don't know. It's been harder and harder to tell over the years. It's like his emotions are slowly eroding. To be honest, I can't tell if he even cares about me anymore. They're quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	I should get back.
F	LAURIE	Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do it? Why did we dress up like that? I think the Keene Act was the best thing to ever happen to us.
M	DAN	You're probably right.
F	LAURIE	I mean, you remember my costume? All that tight spandex? That was awful.
M	DAN	Uh, yeah. Awful.
F	LAURIE	And to think my own mother pushed me into that spandex. Pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place. Wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys. Well, I guess my ride is here. She gives Dan a hug.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	We'll do this again.
M	DAN	Yeah. I'd really like that. Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan
M	KID 1	I'm Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin Towers!
M	KID 2	No, I wanna be Dr. Manhattan!
M	MOTHER	You can take turns, okay? Dan watches the Kids for a moment, then walks away. The Twin
F	SALLY	Laurie? Is that you?
F	SALLY	I'd figure you'd be used to traveling that way by now.
F	LAURIE	Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me.
F	SALLY	Margarita?
F	LAURIE	No. Sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the
F	SALLY	It's Eddie Blake's funeral today, isn't it? Laurie nods. (From here on, intercut between Blake's funeral FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is removed from the hearse.
M	SALLY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor Eddie.
F	LAURIE	Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After what he--
F	SALLY	Laurie, you're still young. You don't understand how things change as time goes by. FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is carried past Adrian, Dan and Dr.
M	LAURIE (V.0.)	Another lesson on time passing. Y'know, you and Jon should get together and write a book on the subject. Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of
F	SALLY	That leaves just two of the old team left. Me and Hollis Mason. She stops at Blake in the photo, regarding him.
M	SALLY (V.O.)	Eddie was the Comedian. He always thought he'd get the last laugh. As the PRIEST speaks, we move down the row of mourners,
M	BLAKE (O.S.)	Fireworks. A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His
M	BLAKE (CONT'D)	You'd think this country'd had enough goddamn fireworks. If we'd've lost this war, I think it might have driven us crazy, y'know? As a country. But we didn't. Thanks to you.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	You sound bitter.
M	BLAKE	Me? I think it's hilarious.
M	VIETNAMESE GIRL (O.S.)	Mr. Eddie? They both turn. A pretty VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door.
M	BLAKE	Fantastic. Just what I need.
M	VIETNAMESE GIRL	The war is over now. We must talk. About this. Blake SLAMS his glass down. He glares at her, drunk and
M	BLAKE	There's nothing to talk about cuz I'm leaving. I'm gonna forget you and your horrible, sweaty little country. He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred.
M	VIETNAMESE GIRL	No. You will remember. You will remember me and my country forever. She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS
M	BLAKE	You bitch! My face! He PUSHES HER into the bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Blake . don't. BLAM! Blake shoots her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall.
M	DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)	Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her down. Blake turns on him, spitting fury.
M	BLAKE	That's right! And you know what? You watched me! You could've changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury or the bottle into snowflakes, but you didn't, did you? You're drifting outta touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me the war got to you. Blake walks off shouting "Medic!" Dr. Manhattan turns to the
M	BLAKE (V.0.)	This is all bullshit. Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the
F	ADRIAN	What are you saying, Comedian? Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table,
M	BLAKE	What I'm saying is this whole bringing back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It didn't work twenty years ago, and it ain't gonna work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and Indians.
M	DAN	Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.
F	RORSCHACH	That's true. But something like this seems too big. Too bureaucratic.
F	ADRIAN	Bureaucracies can be effective with the right leadership--
M	BLAKE	And that would be you, right Veidt? I mean you're the "smartest guy in the world," right?
F	ADRIAN	It doesn't take a genius to see that the world has problems.
M	BLAKE	But it takes a roomful of morons to think they're small enough for you guys to handle. You people are a joke. You hear Moloch's back in town and get your panties in a bunch. You think that matters?
F	RORSCHACH	Of course it does. Justice matters.
M	BLAKE	Justice. Hilarious. There's no such thing as justice. He stands, moving to Adrian's DISPLAY which outlines the
F	ADRIAN	My display .
M	BLAKE	Justice doesn't matter, alright? Because twenty years from now we're all gonna be dust. Mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time and now we finally got the power to finish the job. Ain't nothin' gonna matter when the nukes start flying, and I promise you they will. Then Ozymandias here is gonna be the smartest man on the cinder. He sneers and walks out. Silence. Uncomfortable in the wake ANGLE ON: AN OVAL AIRSHIP--the OWL SHIP--its forward windows Dan, in costume, pilots the ship. The Comedian stands outside
M	DAN	
M	BLAKE	Crawl back in yer holes before you get hurt! I got rubber bullets!
M	MAN IN CROWD	We want regular cops! No more vigilantes!
M	WOMAN IN CROWD	My son is a cop, asshole! The Comedian gets HIT IN THE HEAD by a flying SODA CAN.
M	BLAKE	Okay, that's how you wanna do it?! Smiling grimly, he FIRES TEAR GAS CANNISTERS INTO THE CROWD.
M	DAN	Oh God.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Comedian, this is a nightmare! The whole city is erupting!
M	BLAKE	Hah! You seen this? The smoke clears enough for Dan to see a message SPRAY-
M	DAN	How long can we keep this up?
M	BLAKE	My government contacts tell me they're pushing some new bill through Congress.
M	BLAKE (CONT'D)	Until then, we're society's only protection.
M	DAN	Protection from what? Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos.
M	BLAKE	Are you kidding? From themselves.
M	PRIEST	Lord have mercy upon us. Amen. Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a
F	RORSCHACH	Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.
M	MOLOCH	What are you talking about? I'm a retired business maaAAAHHH! Rorschach TWISTS the man's arm back viciously.
F	RORSCHACH	Lie again, I'll break your arm.
M	MOLOCH	Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him.
F	RORSCHACH	You attended a funeral today. Why?
M	MOLOCH	The funeral? I don't know why I went. I just felt I should. I'd been thinking about the Comedian-- Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall.
F	RORSCHACH	How did you know Blake was the Comedian?
M	MOLOCH	He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had his mask off. He was drunk--
F	RORSCHACH	You were enemies for forty years. Why would he visit you?
M	MOLOCH	I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and there he was! He was upset! Crying!
F	RORSCHACH	The Comedian? Crying?
M	MOLOCH	He, he was babbling, not making sense. I was pissing in my pants--I thought he was going to kill me!
F	RORSCHACH	What did he say?!
M	MOLOCH	He said he was wrong. About it all being a joke, that it wasn't funny anymore. He said he was scared--
F	RORSCHACH	Scared of what?!
M	MOLOCH	Something he saw, I think. He said something about wishing he never broke into that building. But that he had to keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left!
F	RORSCHACH	Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers,
M	MOLOCH	So that's it? I'm clean?
F	RORSCHACH	Clean? I searched your house. Found illegal drugs.
M	MOLOCH	Illegal--I don't use drugs. Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat.
F	RORSCHACH	Laetril. Phony medication made from apricot pits. Illegal.
M	MOLOCH	oh c-come on. Look, please don't confiscate that. I'm trying anything . I have cancer.
F	RORSCHACH	What kind of cancer?
M	MOLOCH	The kind you don't get better from.
F	RORSCHACH	Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble, Moloch.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	Rorschach's Journal, October 17th. Thought about Moloch's story on my way to the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	But if it's true, then what? What could have possibly scared the Comedian? What building was he talking about? What was it that he saw? So many questions.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944, buried in the rain. Murdered. FLASH TO: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as his door
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Violent lives ending violently. FLASH TO: Adrian's display burning.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Blake understood. Humans are violent in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the Blake saw the true face of human kind and chose to become a parody of it, treated it like a joke. FLASHES OF: Blake being beaten in his apartment.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I heard a joke once. Man goes to a doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Blake is KICKED in the stomach.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Doctor says, "the treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Blake is lifted up by the Intruder's hands.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	The man bursts into tears. A bloodied Blake laughs at the Intruder.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	"But doctor," he says. ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window.
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	"I am Pagliacci." Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Good joke. Everybody laugh. Blake FALLS INTO FRAME--GO BLACK .
F	LAURIE	Mmm. What time do you have to be at your TV interview?
M	DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)	Don't worry, we have plenty of time. Eyes still closed, she does not see a THIRD BLUE HAND trace a
F	LAURIE	Hey, your finger, it's like licking a battery. It's all-- She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	Oh God! That's horrible! Stop it! Laurie jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused.
M	DR. MANHATTAN 1 DR. MANHATTAN 2	Please don't be upset. I thought you'd enjoy it.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, I--You startled me, that's all
M	DR. MANHATTAN 1	I don't know what stimulates you anymore. Laurie backs into the hall, trying to get a grip.
F	LAURIE	Forget about it. I overreacted. It was just strange to see-- Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	How long have you been working in here?
M	DR. MANHATTAN 1	Laurie, try to understand--
F	LAURIE	Understand!? You're working in here at the same time we're in bed!?
M	DR. MANHATTAN 3	My work with Adrian is at an important stage. It seemed unnecessary to--
F	LAURIE	Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH Laurie, please--If you think there's a problem with my attitude, I'm prepared to discuss it-- As he speaks, the smashed BEAKER and its contents RISE INTO
M	DR. MANHATTAN 2	--but logically, not clouded with human emotion.
F	LAURIE	Human emotion? You were human once. That's the problem, Jon. You've forgotten that.
M	DR. MANHATTAN 2	Laurie, where are you-- The door slams. Laurie's left. For good.
M	NEWS ANALYST (V.O.)	--no one's fired their weapons yet, but no one's lowered them either. Maybe these other countries aren't so afraid of Dr. Manhattan, maybe they're calling the President's bluff. I'm very curious to see what Dr. Manhattan himself has to say in his live interview which should be in about an hour or so BOOM, BOOM! Dan looks up. Someone's banging on the door.
M	DAN	Who is it?
M	LAURIE (O.S.)	It's Laurie.
M	DAN	Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open the door.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a little sticky--
F	LAURIE	I left Jon.
M	DAN	Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you here?
F	LAURIE	I lost them in the subways. I think.
M	DAN	I'm really sorry, Laurie.
F	LAURIE	Living with him . Dan, you don't know what it's been like. INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring.
M	LAURIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	The way he looks at things, like he can't remember what they are, like he doesn't really care. This world, the real world to him it's like walking through mist, and all the people are just shadows. Shadows in the fog. Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He
F	LAURIE	I hope I didn't ruin your night.
M	DAN	Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless
M	NEWS VENDOR	--I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about that right wing rag so much? Cuz those bastards don't give a damn about you, pal! They--hold up, here it comes. They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a
M	DAN	Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I'm here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following.
F	LAURIE	I know. I just find it rude when people show up at your door--
M	LAURIE (V.0.)	--completely out of the blue. Suddenly, Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The
M	PRODUCER	Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me?
M	RECEPTIONIST	He, he just--
M	PRODUCER	All geez. We don't have time for make-up. That blue is too light for television.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Is this dark enough?
M	PRODUCER	Uh, yeah
M	PRODUCER (V.0.)	that's dark enough.
M	PRESS AGENT	Just another reminder that if the second Geneva Convention comes up, our official position is that talks will not resume until the Chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda. The President approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen morale at home and to gently remind the rest of the world who holds the cards. Please keep that in mind. Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up
M	NEWS HOST	He's been called many things; Hero, weapon, linchpin of our security--
M	NEWS HOST (CONT'D)	His given name is Jonathan Osterman--Dr. Jonathan Osterman--a renowned nuclear physicist who through a terrible accident became the man the world knows today as Dr. Manhattan. The audience APPLAUDS loudly as Dr. Manhattan takes his seat.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Thank you.
M	NEWS HOST	Thank you, Dr. Manhattan, and not simply for appearing on this program. I believe I speak for all of America when I thank you for thwarting the terrorist plot at the port of Long Beach over a week ago-- Furious applause from the audience, which Dr. Manhattan
M	DR. MANHATTAN	It was my duty. Dan grapples with one of the Thugs and knocks his knife away--
M	NEWS HOST	Before we start, I want to explain to our viewers the unconventional format for this interview. Our live audience is made up entirely of news media and Dr. Manhattan will be taking questions from the floor. This commercial free broadcast is presented to you by Veidt Enterprises. We see Adrian standing near the audience with the Press
M	NEWS HOST (V.0.) (CONT'D)	We will now take our first question-- The Thug draws a PISTOL on her. Dan, still on the ground,
M	DOUG ROTH	Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do you remember a man named Wally Weaver?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, he was a good friend of mine. When we were both physicists.
M	DOUG ROTH	He died of cancer.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I remember. I attended his funeral.
M	DOUG ROTH	How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of battles with him, didn't you? Did you know that he has cancer as-well? The News Host looks confused. Adrian turns to the Press
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I was not aware--
M	DOUG ROTH	And what about Jose Flores? He was the longtime janitor at the Watchmen Headquarters where you worked for many years. Cancer.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	By your line of questioning, you're suggesting that I was the cause of cancer in these individuals.
M	DOUG ROTH	You tell me, doc. Adrian turns to him.
F	ADRIAN	Doug, that `s enough.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	It is irrelevant whether I was the cause or not.
M	DOUG ROTH	Irrelevant?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles. Structurally there's no difference. An appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience.
M	DOUG ROTH	What about Janey Slater? Do you think it makes a difference to her?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Janey Slater? Wh--
M	DOUG ROTH	Your ex-girlfriend, she was a physicist too. You were with her for ten years. Or does she have to remind you herself? Suddenly Janey Slater emerges from a door at the top of the
M	DOUG ROTH (CONT'D)	She has cancer as well. Doctors have given her six months. What do you have to say, Ms. Slater? He sticks the microphone in her face.
M	JANEY SLATER	D-damn you, Jon. God damn you She leaves as fast as she came, bursting into tears. Dr.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	No, Janey, wait! In the audience, Adrian turns to the Press Agent, frantic.
F	ADRIAN	We need to stop this now. Adrian and the Press Agent hurry on stage, SECURITY
M	PRESS AGENT	That's it! Interview's over! BACK TO: The alley, littered with the unconscious BODIES of
F	ADRIAN	As the sponsor of this program I demand all cameras off! His plea is futile, of course. A REPORTER breaks through,
M	REPORTER 1	Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by sleeping with her?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	No. Please let me through
M	REPORTER 2	Do you even care about human life?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Please. If everyone would just go away and leave me alone. Adrian hears the note of warning in his voice.
F	ADRIAN	Everyone back off! Don't you understand? He's the only thing preventing the world from chaos!
M	DOUG ROTH	How many other people did you do this to? Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I said LEAVE ME ALONE! Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr.
F	LAURIE	I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us getting mugged.
M	DAN	Why don't you come by Hollis' with me? Shake off the adrenaline.
F	LAURIE	No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for one night. You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous world out there.
M	HOLLIS	You're late.
M	DAN	I know, you won't believe it--
M	HOLLIS	You missed it--Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.
M	DAN	Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan
M	DAN (CONT'D)	I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.
M	HOLLIS	She'll know soon enough. The whole world will know.
M	BLAKE (O.S.)	Laurel? Laurel Jane? Startled, Laurie turns. Blake steps out of the shadows.
M	BLAKE (CONT'D)	You're Sally Jupiter's kid.
F	LAURIE	You're the Comedian, right? You were pretty cool in there. Blake lights a smoke, looks her over.
M	BLAKE	You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny little mole.
F	LAURIE	Got another smoke?
M	BLAKE	She was one of the all-time champion beauties, your mom. She talk about me much?
F	LAURIE	No. Not really. As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover Laurie nearly jumps out of her skin. A younger Sally marches
M	BLAKE	Hey Doll. Long time no see.
F	SALLY	Not long enough in my book, Eddie. She eyes Laurie with cool death.
M	SALLY (CONT'D)	Put that out. Get in the car. INSIDE THE LIMO: Laurie cracks her window an inch. Her
M	SALLY (CONT'D)	Are there no depths you won't sink to?
M	BLAKE	Christ, we were just talking! Can't a guy talk to his, y'know, friend's daughter? What the hell do you think I am?
F	SALLY	I know what you are, Eddie. I've always known. Don't ever forget that. Driving off, Laurie watches Blake through the window-- --when a BLACK SUV pulls in front of the cab, BLOCKING its The Cabbie honks his horn as a team of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
M	AGENT FORBES	Ms. Jupiter, you need to come with us now.
F	LAURIE	I don't understand, what do you mean, Jon's gone?
M	AGENT FORBES	I mean he snapped and disappeared during the interview. Now our trackers can't detect him anywhere on the planet. If we want to find him you're our only hope. A TECHNICIAN wires Laurie up; GRAPHS record Laurie's neural Miss Jupiter, we need you to visualize Dr. Manhattan. Do you need a prompt?
F	LAURIE	No.
M	TECHNICIAN 2	Neurotransmissions tracking.
M	TECHNICIAN 3	Transmitting on all frequencies. We're ready Miss Jupiter. We need you to try and talk to him. Laurie, wired like a porcupine, seems embarrassed.
F	LAURIE	Jon? Jon, can you hear me? The GRAPH-NEEDLES jump and tick, searching
M	AGENT FORBES	Have you got him?
M	TECHNICIAN 1	We've located his signal, yes.
M	AGENT FORBES	Well? Where the hell is he? The Technician looks up, not happy about the answer.
M	TECHNICIAN 1	He's on Mars.
M	NEWS REPORTER 1 (V.0.)	--massive mobilization of troops in
M	NEWS REPORTER 2 (V.0.)	--unconfirmed reports of a gunfire exchange in Tehran--
M	NEWS REPORTER 3 (V.0.)	--prompting the President to call an emergency meeting with his National Security Advisors--
M	LAURIE (V.0.)	Jon. Can you hear me, Jon? But these VOICES get progressively QUIETER, as we--
M	JANEY SLATER	Aww, Jon, look--you've got cotton candy on the side of your mouth
M	JON OSTERMAN	You do too. Here, let me get it for you. He pulls her close. They giggle like the young lovers they BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan walking on mars' surface. He --and we FLASHBACK, mirroring the parting of the rock I'll catch up with you guys--I left my watch inside . Jon backs into the chamber without noticing the DIGITAL CLOCK BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars as he stops to pick up a --and we FLASHBACK to Jon's lab COLLEAGUES watching in horror
M	JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D)	Janey? What's wrong?
M	JANEY SLATER	The time lock, Jon! As it dawns on Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR
M	JON OSTERMAN	Janey: Oh my god! TEARS stream down Janey's face as she looks at him through
M	JANEY SLATER	I'm sorry, Jon, I can't-- Janey can't bear to watch--she runs out of the lab as the . and with a BLINDING FLASH--Jon and his watch are BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he obliterates the strange and we FLASHBACK to the lab CAFETERIA. Janey sits at a BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he RISES into the air. At --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria KITCHEN as a COOK SHRIEKS --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria HALLWAY as a SKELETON BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan, now dwarfed by the RISING, EVOLVING and in a BLINDING FLASH, THE PARTICLES FORM DR.
M	JANEY SLATER	Oh god . Jon is that you? --recognition. BACK TO: Mars, where Dr. Manhattan's GLASS PALACE rises in
M	AGENT FORBES	There must be some way to contact him. Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten.
F	LAURIE	Agent Forbes.
M	AGENT FORBES	What?
F	LAURIE	I need to go to the bathroom. Agent Forbes gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET
F	LAURIE	You're getting me out of here.
M	SECRET SERVICE AGENT	We're only detaining you for national security purposes. Don't you understand?
F	LAURIE	Don't you understand that sitting there with a bunch of high tech radios and
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	Only one thing can bring ion back and that's Jon. If he wants to find me, he's quite capable of doing so on his own. I've been a prisoner in my live long enough. You are taking me out of here because if you don't, and Jon does come back, I'm going to let him know who was naughty and who was nice. And he won't give you a lump of coal--he'll turn you into one, understand? The Agent eyes her, then reluctantly gets to his feet.
M	DAN	Jesus! Rorschach
F	RORSCHACH	Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your paper. Dan reads the headline: "DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH."
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	The Comedian murdered. Dr. Manhattan exiled. Two of us gone within a week. Who's next? Veidt? Ms. Jupiter? Me? You?
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	By the way, that new lock broke after one shove.
M	DAN	My new lock?
F	RORSCHACH	Get a stronger one, Daniel. You can't be too security conscious these days.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	These days nobody's safe. We see the same Pakistani Soldiers from before, only now
M	AIDE	--three synagogues were bombed in Tel Aviv, a bus exploded in Jerusalem--
M	ISRAELI OFFICER	Enough! Begin the first wave of air strikes.
M	SECRETARY OF STATE	The Chinese have already made their move. India and Pakistan have engaged and everyone in the Middle East is going at Israel. Time to start picking sides, Mr. President.
M	PRESIDENT	Forget picking sides--first, are we safe?
M	SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY	We've increased security at all entry points: water ports, airports and border patrol.
M	PRESIDENT	I want the National Guard put on the border. As for the rest of it . let's not jump into the fray just yet.
M	SECRETARY OF DEFENSE	Mr. President, I urge you to--
M	PRESIDENT	Let's just wait, okay?! Maybe he'll come back. Maybe he'll come back.
M	ASSISTANT	Clock's ticking, Mr. Veidt.
F	ADRIAN	I know. I'm meeting the toy people, yes?
M	ASSISTANT	Eleven-thirty. They want to talk to you about some new villains for the "Ozymandias" line.
F	ADRIAN	All the old villains are dead.
M	ASSISTANT	What's with everybody today? Everyone's on this death trip.
F	ADRIAN	I suppose the threat of war has that effect. ACROSS THE WAY, Dan enters the building, intercepts Adrian.
M	DAN	Adrian, I need to talk to you. Adrian looks put off.
F	ADRIAN	Dan, I'm sorry, this is a bad time.
M	DAN	But what about what happened with ion? Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant.
F	ADRIAN	Jon's departure is terrible. Not only for what's happening in the world now, but for what could have happened. The energy project he and I were working on--it's dead now .
M	DAN	Rorschach came to see me again. Maybe there's something to this mask killer thing.
F	ADRIAN	Are you still preoccupied with the ramblings of that lunatic? I really don't have time for this, Dan. Adrian walks away, continuing on with his Assistant
M	PERSONAL ASSISTANT	Sometimes I can't bear to watch the news. It makes it so hard to be optimistic Is that a gun? Dan sees what's happening--
M	DAN	Adrian! BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in the gut; Adrian --and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE ASSASSIN, knocking him SECURITY GUARDS run, guns drawn, toward the fountain where
M	SECURITY GUARD	Mr. Veidt! Let us handle it!
F	ADRIAN	Wait, he's got a poison capsule! He JAMS his fingers into the Assassin's mouth when Dan Don't bite down, you scum! I want to know who sent you! The Assassin's eyes BULGE
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	I want to know who's behind this! The Assassin CHOKES and dies. Adrian DROPS him,
F	LAURIE	Oh my god. Where's Adrian now?
M	DAN	Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen him What about you? What are you going to do?
F	LAURIE	I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom- -I'm sure that's the first place they'll look. But I need to get out of the city. It's only a matter of time before they find me.
M	DAN	Listen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place?
F	LAURIE	Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose--
M	DAN	It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happening
F	LAURIE	You're buying into Rorschach's "mask killer" theory?
M	DAN	I don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles.
F	LAURIE	Okay. So this guy who tried to kill Adrian--who was he? Some local low-life named Roy Chess Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw
M	DIRECTORY.	Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types A photo of Janey Slater pops up--"Status: RETIRED."
M	RORSCHACH (V.O.)	Rorschach's Journal, October 19th. Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory--the murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and
M	RORSCHACH (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Checked mail drop, got a message from Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	My things are where I left them. My coat. My gloves Still in his POV, we watch him put each article on. Then he
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	. my face. Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREEN
F	RORSCHACH	Somebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries. So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you from the same company-- obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes. Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
M	DET. FINE (O.S.)	
F	RORSCHACH	No.
F	RORSCHACH	No. No, no, no Moloch's corpse stares at Rorschach. Rorschach TEARS OPEN the
F	RORSCHACH	Framed. Set up. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
F	RORSCHACH	Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER.
F	RORSCHACH	When you are
M	SWAT COP 1	It's a bum tip, I'm telling you.
M	SWAT COP 2-	Keep your eyes open. SWAT Cop 1 moves down the hall, carelessly ahead of formation- Rorschach BOLTS upstairs, IGNITING the staircase behind him.
M	SWAT COP 3	Where'd he go?
M	SWAT COP 2	Upstairs! He's upstairs! Go!
M	SWAT COP 3	Where is he?! Send the second team in! Graves is down! And we need a fire unit. All this smoke--
M	SWAT COP 2	Stay calm, the file says he never goes armed. Rorschach APPEARS, blowing PEPPER INTO COP 2'S EYES.
M	SWAT COP 3	Get out of the way! I don't have room to-- The HOOK BLOWS THE BODY-ARMORED COP OVER THE RAILING.
M	DET. FINE	We've got him. There's no way out. From the second floor, Rorschach SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, But Rorschach holds up a gloved hand. And they all stop,
F	RORSCHACH	Ten years. I've waited for this. He beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me--
M	FINE	Get that mask off him!
M	COP 1	I got it. Christ, he stinks!
F	RORSCHACH	No no no NO NO NO! The Cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the Homeless
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	My face! Give it back to me! Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's
F	LAURIE	What time is it?
M	DAN	Noon. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark?
M	ANCHORWOMAN	Today, police searched the apartment of Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured last night and charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found shot in the head at point blank range. Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on
M	ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D)	Inside the decrepit apartment, police discovered stacks of right-wing literature, including several years of back issues of the ultra-conservative publication, "The New Frontiersman." We asked "New Frontiersman" editor, Hector Godfrey, for comment.
M	EDITOR	Rorschach is an American patriot and we are proud that he reads this publication.
M	ANCHORWOMAN	During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and severely injured at least nine police officers, shooting one officer with a grappling gun. That officer is in serious but stable condition.
M	ANCHORMAN	Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues to intensify. Both India and Pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear weapons is not out of the question-- Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk.
F	LAURIE	That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains away.
M	DAN	He wasn't always like that. We were a great team--tactically, he was brilliant. But I don't know, something about this murder charge I just can't see Rorschach shooting Moloch.
F	LAURIE	He shot a cop with a grappling gun.
M	DAN	Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary
F	LAURIE	And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet. Like Jon.
M	DAN	Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.
F	LAURIE	Now, that's funny. That's what you call Jon's teleportation?
M	DAN	Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Walter Kovacs. Is that your name? Walter?
F	RORSCHACH	No. The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Let me explain your situation here, Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may be able to convince them that you should to be treated medically, in a hospital, which I believe is best for you. But the authorities want to put you in General Population.
F	RORSCHACH	A prison is a prison.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Yes, but the difference is, downstairs? They'll eat you alive. He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD.
M	PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D)	Now . . tell me what you see. FLASH OF: A DEAD DOG. Bloody, horrible.
F	RORSCHACH	A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	How about this one? What do you see here? FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER,
F	RORSCHACH	Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card.
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	Clouds. The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the cards down.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that?
F	RORSCHACH	Why are you here with me, doctor?
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Because I want to make you well.
F	RORSCHACH	There's other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine. Of course, they're not famous. You want to know about Rorschach, doctor? I'll tell you about Rorschach
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	I was investigating a kidnap case. Blair Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then. Too soft on criminals. I let them live.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	I knew the girl was here. But when I searched the place I found nothing. Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	And then I found her. . to the dogs, still fighting over the BONE, which we now Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He reaches for a
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	It was dark when the murderer got back. As dark as it gets. FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE.
M	CHILD MOLESTER	You think I had something to do with that girl? I didn't! Where's your evidence? Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog. (It is the
M	CHILD MOLESTER (CONT'D)	Okay, I confess! I kidnapped her! I killed her! Arrest me!
F	RORSCHACH	Men get arrested. Rorschach RAISES THE CLEAVER, high over his head Dogs get put down. Rorschach SWINGS the cleaver DOWN. Blood SPATTERS his mask.
F	RORSCHACH	A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm blood splashed my face. It was Walter Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes-- The silence reels out You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that little girl, fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind. From then on, I knew. God doesn't make the world this way. We do. The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	I can't help him.
M	RANDOM VOICE	Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was a whore! A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins
M	PRISONER	Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous, right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too. Maybe I can give you my autograph. The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve Rorschach doesn't register this. He waits for the FRY-COOK --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins,
F	RORSCHACH	None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	You're locked up in here with me.
F	LAURIE	All these gadgets and there isn't even a dash lighter She hits a BUTTON--the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She hits
M	DAN	Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer Dan grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Where are you?! Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie stumbles from the smoke, out of
F	LAURIE	I'm so sorry--I hit the wrong button. I was looking for the lighter in.there.
M	DAN	I don't smoke. Are you hurt?
F	LAURIE	I'm fine, but your ship--
M	DAN	Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's pretty resilient.
F	LAURIE	Archie? Short for Archimedes--Merlin's owl. I'm just glad you're okay. I heard you scream and well, you know, after the Comedian--
F	LAURIE	Still with the mask-killer theory? Rorschach is insane.
M	DAN	Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me uneasy. Dan goes to a BANK OF SWITCHES on the wall. Flicking them,
F	LAURIE	How did you ever afford all this?
M	DAN	My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me quite a bit. Which always surprised me.
F	LAURIE	How did he die?
M	DAN	Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him
F	LAURIE	You really do worry about me, don't you?
M	DAN	Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends-- Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Sorry, I
F	LAURIE	What's wrong? But Dan is already walking up the stairs, pathetic. Laurie's
M	BIG FIGURE (O.S.)	It's been a long time, Rorschach.
F	RORSCHACH	Big Figure. Small world.
M	BIG FIGURE	I like that. But you know, it is a small world in here. I've been in it for--how long now, Billy?
M	DUMB THUG	Twenty years, Mr. Figure.
M	BIG FIGURE	That's right. Twenty years since you and that owl fella put me away. Rorschach-- that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute now. And when he does, this place is gonna explode. Then you die by inches.
F	RORSCHACH	Tall order.
M	FAT THUG	I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole!
M	BIG FIGURE	Relax, Lloyd. Soon. Chuckling, Big Figure walks off down the long, shadowed In the background, a NUCLEAR BLAST ERUPTS. Still kissing, the
F	LAURIE	Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you coming down the stairs Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume,
M	DAN	Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation. I feel so powerless, so I've been afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of how much I need it. He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark.
F	LAURIE	So. Let's take the ship out.
M	DAN	What?
F	LAURIE	Who's to know? I used to be a "masked avenger" too, remember? I'm used to getting up at three in the morning to do something stupid. Besides, I'm already a wanted lady, you're already in trouble for hiding me, how much more trouble can we be in? Just give me a second--can't go out like this. She jogs upstairs. Dan turns to the empty, waiting suit.
M	DAN	I can't believe it still fits. Luckily I constructed it with material that was elastic and-- Dan turns as Laurie appears at the door, decked in her BLACK
M	DAN (CONT'D)	--form fitting
F	LAURIE	I'm ready. Dan turns and sees his reflection in the owl-Ship's window.
M	DAN	Me too.
M	DAN	Let's have some cloud cover.
F	LAURIE	It's so beautiful
M	DAN	Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course of justice. Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last
F	LAURIE	Look! Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw There's children in there!
M	DAN	I'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories.
M	YOU.	Can you escort the people over? She watches him move, quick, confident. She smiles.
F	LAURIE	I'm on it. Nite Owl.
F	LAURIE	Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll have you out of here in just a moment. ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof
F	LAURIE	Anybody want coffee?
F	LAURIE	I can't believe we did that! That was actually fun
M	DAN	Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He
F	LAURIE	It was good, wasn't it?
M	DAN	Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan
M	DAN (CONT'D)	It--you were unbelievable. They kiss.
F	LAURIE	So . what do we do next? Dan sits up, serious. Very serious.
M	DAN	I've been thinking about that. And I believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity. I think we should spring Rorschach.
M	LAURIE (V.0.)	What?
M	BIG FIGURE	He's dead, Rorschach--the riot's already begun. While everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift. Something from the machine shop.
M	FAT THUG	Hey Boss, y'notice? None of that "small world, tall order" crap, cuz he knows once we slice open this lock, he's next on the block.
F	RORSCHACH	Fat chance. The Fat Thug reddens. He DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for
M	FAT THUG	You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison full of killers out here! What've you got? Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS,
F	RORSCHACH	Your hands. My pleasure. Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS.
M	DUMB THUG	I can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?
M	BIG FIGURE	This riot won't last. And I've been waiting twenty years for this Big Figure nods to the Dumb Thug, who then grabs Fat Thug's
M	DUMB THUG	Nothing personal, big guy.
M	FAT THUG	Boss, you can't be serious! Wait-- Dumb Thug SNAPS Fat Thug's neck. He then CUTS OFF Fat Thug's
M	BIG FIGURE	Now you find out what the score is.
F	RORSCHACH	One-nothing. Come and get me.
F	LAURIE	Look, Dan, I'm glad you were able to rediscover your calling in life, but I think you're getting carried away. You're talking about springing a homicidal psychopath from prison.
M	DAN	Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's on to something--four heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that whole cancer thing with ion, does that make sense to you? You didn't contract cancer from him. He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes
F	LAURIE	Why would someone want to drive ion away? Look what's happening now. With Jon gone it looks like we're headed for another World War. Who would want that? OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: The Owl-Ship approaches a ROOFTOP with a
M	DAN	I don't know. But I know someone who might be able to help. Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof. You're leaving town? So you do believe Rorschach's theory.
F	ADRIAN	Please. Right now, I'm not concerned with this so-called mask-killer, I'm concerned with the mass killer called war, or have you not heard. On ! A WALL SIZED MIRROR turns into a TV:
M	CNN NEWSCASTER	--US Aircraft Carriers have already moved into the Persian Gulf and US Battleships have left Japan en route to the Far East
F	LAURIE	It's happening Dan breaks away from the terrible news, follows Adrian.
M	DAN	All the more reason we need to get to the bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to come back in the process and stop all this madness.
F	ADRIAN	Nothing we do will bring Jon back! But I think you know that already. And breaking Rorschach out of prison certainly isn't the answer.
M	DAN	Rorschach's been the only one investigating this from the start. Without him, we're starting at the beginning and we don't have that kind of time. We need your help, Adrian.
F	ADRIAN	I'm leaving, Dan. And I suggest you both do the same. Adrian pulls on a thick WINTER COAT and heads upstairs.
M	DAN	Where are you going to go?
F	ADRIAN	Antarctica. It takes Dan a moment to realize Adrian is serious. By then,
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Good luck, Dan. He says it sincerely. Dan watches the helicopter fly off.
M	BIG FIGURE	Hurry Lloyd! I wanna smell this sonofabitch cooking! The lock MELTS AWAY. Rorschach climbs onto his bunk as Dumb Dumb Thug's hand FUSES to the welder as ELECTRICITY SURGES
F	RORSCHACH	Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really. Big Figure looks very small and alone now Two-nothing. Your move. Panic stricken, Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach
M	DAN	You don't have to do this. I know the whole crimefighting thing wasn't necessarily your choice in life.
F	LAURIE	No. But this is. She moves next to him.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	But I'm not doing it for Rorschach or even for Jon. And I'm sure as hell not doing if for the Comedian. They look at each other--Dan knows who she's doing it for.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	Look! They see a RIOT below--Inmates spilling out into the yard,
M	DAN	Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if that's a coincidence. They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Put your ear-plugs in.
F	LAURIE	How are we going to find Rorschach in all of this?
M	DAN	When he and I were partners, we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if either one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see if Rorschach kept his in. Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	He's in that wing. Dan steers the ship toward the Maximum Security Wing. 9 As Laurie descends the ladder, Dan simply, joyously LEAPS Laurie and Dan turn the corner, searching. Laurie spots the
F	LAURIE	How do we know he's still alive? They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE
M	DAN	He's alive.
F	LAURIE	Is that--
M	DAN	Rorschach? Rorschach!
F	RORSCHACH	Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I just have to visit the men's room. He disappears into the dark bathroom. Laurie watches after
F	LAURIE	Oh, for Christ's sake.
M	DAN	Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big arrest like that once. Had to redesign the costume after that-- Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands.
F	RORSCHACH	We can leave now. He walks off.
F	LAURIE	Are you sure you're ready? We don't want to go diving head-first into things.
F	RORSCHACH	Good Advice. I'm sure there are many who'd agree with you. Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom door as
F	RORSCHACH	Good to see you in uniform, Daniel. What happened? Finally taking the mask-killer seriously?
F	LAURIE	I'm not.
F	RORSCHACH	Of course you haven't been attacked yet. Funny, most everyone else has.
F	LAURIE	What's that supposed to mean? We came here to rescue you, asshole!
M	DAN	Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire. The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in.
M	DAN	Rorschach, you remember how to handle Archie?
F	RORSCHACH	I believe so. Rorschach sits in the pilot's seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	Daniel.
M	DAN	Give us a second--
F	RORSCHACH	I don't think this can wait.
M	DAN	What? What is it Dan looks up, through the windshield, and sees--
F	LAURIE	It `s him. The ship COLLIDES with Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Hello Laurie.
F	LAURIE	They said you were on Mars.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I am on Mars. You and I are about to have a conversation there.
F	LAURIE	Where? What are you talking about?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	You are going to try to convince me to save the world.
M	DAN	Wait, what? You're taking her to Mars? No, she can't--Laurie, I don't know about
M	THIS	Laurie looks at Dan then at Dr. Manhattan. Comprehending
F	LAURIE	I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we're going to talk. Maybe we'll find some way out of this mess the world's gotten itself in. I'll be okay. Really. Laurie and Dr. Manhattan BURST INTO PARTICLES--they're gone.
F	RORSCHACH	No time for heartbreak, Daniel. Dan notes TWO BLIPS on the RADAR.
M	DAN	Let's try and lose them in the city. He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	So. What do you think?
F	LAURIE	J--huc? Hhhhhhh-- Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Oh. Forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind. He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE around her.
F	LAURIE	Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you better not forget this air supply or whatever it is Oh shit. Laurie stands up before Jon's huge GLASS PALACE.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	I'm on Mars. --and heads straight for a SUBWAY TUNNEL --when a SUBWAY appears. They're heading straight for it.
M	DAN	oh no.
F	RORSCHACH	Tactical error, Daniel.
M	DAN	I know-- They head straight for the subway-- --when the tunnel opens up-- --Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in time.
M	DAN	Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found The copter hovers there. Baffled.
M	GANG MEMBER 1	Yo, y'all hear? Some super owl dude broke Rorschach outta prison.
M	GANG LEADER	Rorschach? That fool put my cousin in a
M	GANG MEMBER 2	You say Nite Owl broke him out? Didn't he write a book or something? He lives over a garage near here.
M	GANG LEADER	Does he now
M	HOLLIS	It's just like old times, Sal. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre back at it again.
F	SALLY	I always knew Laurie had it in her. Sorry for waking you, Hollis.
M	HOLLIS	I may be retired from the costume, but my sleeping habits have never changed. There's a KNOCK at Hollis's door.
M	HOLLIS (CONT'D)	Who--there's someone at the door. It might be Dan and Laurie--they may need help. I better go. Hollis hangs up, heads to the door, excited. He opens the --and the Gang Members PILE INTO HIM. The picture SLOWS DOWN. In his SLO-MO world, Hollis PASTES at Villain in the mouth--
M	GANG MEMBER 1	Hold on, Derf, are you sure this is the right guy--he, he's just an old man.
M	GANG LEADER	Then I'm probably doing him a favor. Hollis, old again, looks up. The SHADOW of the statue
F	RORSCHACH	I hate this. How long are we going to stay down here? Daniel! Dan says nothing. Rorschach puts on his costume.
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	You're letting fear paralyze you. And that woman--
M	DAN	Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks bringing Archie up so you could get your spare costume. We stay put until it cools down out there--they're looking for us.
F	RORSCHACH	Unnecessary? Cowering in the sludge, from the authorities, that's unnecessary. Rorschach pulls his mask on, turns.
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	While we waste time, the mask-killer gets closer. We need to get to Pyramid Industries. Dan sits at the COMPUTER.
M	DAN	I know, you told me already. I'm tapping into all the databases, finding out about the company--
F	RORSCHACH	Sitting at a computer? No. We need to trace the killer--hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people. You've forgotten how we do things. You've been lazing around too long.
M	DAN	Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do you think you are? You live off people while insulting them, and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic! Dan turns away, shaking. He leans against the console.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Maybe you're right, maybe--
M	DANIEL	Dan turns. Rorschach holds out an open hand.
M	RORSCHACH (CONT'D)	You are a good friend. I'm sorry that it is sometimes difficult with me. Touched, Dan shakes his hand. An awkward, lovely moment.
M	DAN	Hey forget it It's okay, man. Releasing his hand with some effort, Dan sits, invigorated.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	You're right. It's time to head up.
M	DAN (V.0.)	Let's really start plumbing the depths.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	surprise me with the information that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.
F	LAURIE	You . know about me and Dan?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Not yet. But in a few moments, you're going to tell me.
F	LAURIE	Jon, I'm having enough problems right now without getting into your predestination crap.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Why does my perception of time distress you so?
F	LAURIE	Because. If you already know the future, why were you surprised when I left you, or when that reporter ambushed you? Why even debate if you already know the outcome?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Because everything is pre-ordained. Even my responses.
F	LAURIE	Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human, like Dan?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	You mean you're sleeping with Dan Dreiberg? Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge.
F	LAURIE	But you already know . You said--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I said, often, that you were my only remaining link with the world. Now that link is shattered. Don't you see the futility of asking me to save a world that I no longer have any stake in?
F	LAURIE	That's ridiculous. The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Not to me. My red world here means more to me than your blue one. I'll show you around if you like. The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE.
F	LAURIE	Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood for jokes.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the gravity of the situation. The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIR
F	RORSCHACH	You sure this is the correct location, Daniel?
M	DAN	Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in industrial plastics. At least they did.
M	DAN	I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT--
F	RORSCHACH	Daniel.
M	DAN	They're harmless, Rorschach.
F	RORSCHACH	Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and
M	DAN	Hey, I know this man.
F	RORSCHACH	Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television.
M	DAN	No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him.
F	RORSCHACH	Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also.
M	DAN	Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian?
F	RORSCHACH	Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense.
M	DAN	On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list.
F	RORSCHACH	That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life.
M	DAN	If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but--
F	RORSCHACH	But why?
M	DAN	I don't know. Let's go ask him.
M	HEAD SCIENTIST	Mr. Veidt, may I?
F	ADRIAN	By all means, Eric.
M	HEAD SCIENTIST	I just would like to say that when I was first offered this position, I was hesitant. A multi-year commitment to work in Antarctica?
M	HEAD SCIENTIST (CONT'D)	But the opportunity to experiment with Dr. Manhattan's atomic fusion energy was too great for me to pass up, too great for any of us to pass up. And now that our work is finished, and we finally get to go home, I can say that it was all worth it. Mr. Veidt, you are a genius. The world will be a better place because of you.
F	ADRIAN	I certainly hope so. The group applauds. Then they sip their champagne. All except The group goes around congratulating each other, when --when one by one they each start collapsing themselves-- Adrian regards them all, writhing on the floor, and leaves.
M	DAN	Something I can help you with, boys? They all spin around, frightened at the costume.
M	GANG MEMBER 1	I told you we had the wrong guy. The Gang Leader shits his pants as Dan steps closer.
M	GANG LEADER	L-listen, I didn't mean to kill that old guy. Things just got outta hand
M	DAN	What old guy? --and sees Dan gripping the bloody Gang Leader by the THROAT,
M	DAN	You're dead! You and the rest of your gang, you're all DEAD! You know how much fire-power I've got floating out there!? Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn god damn Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.
F	RORSCHACH	Not now, Daniel.
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.)	Rorschach's Journal. Final entry? Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is behind everything. Apparently, the Owl- Ship is capable of the trip to Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used to joke that he was fast enough to catch a bullet. I believe he could. He could kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one would know. Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I have done my best to make this legible. Whether I am alive or dead upon this reading, know that whatever the nature of this conspiracy--Adrian Veldt is responsible. He drops the envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the
M	RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I appreciate your recent support and hope the world survives long enough for this to reach you. For my own part, I regret nothing. I have lived my life free of compromise, and step now into the shadow without complaint. Rorschach. October 21st. Rorschach disappears into the dark hatch. The Owl-Ship blasts
M	EDITOR	SEYMOUR! Is that Dulmage's editorial cartoon?
M	SEYMOUR	It's the mail. Hey cool, someone sent us their journal. "Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide. It was later learned to be a homicide. Someone's time was up."
M	EDITOR	War's coming, Seymour--I don't wanna hear some knob's life story! Chuck it in the crank file! Seymour tosses Rorschach's journal into a PILE OF LETTERS.
F	LAURIE	Can't you just tell me how this all ends and save us the trouble?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	It ends with you in tears.
F	LAURIE	Tears. You mean I lose? You don't come back to Earth?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I return to Earth at some point. The streets are filled with death.
F	LAURIE	You mean there's going to be a war? An actual, nuclear war?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I can't be sure. I'm still experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of what lies ahead.
F	LAURIE	Static?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare occurrence. The detonation of nuclear warheads could conceivably be the cause.
F	LAURIE	Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will die!
M	DR. MANHATTAN	And the universe will not even notice. See the dual moons. Aren't they breathtaking? Above, TWO MOONS cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED,
F	LAURIE	You're right, Jon--what does human life matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm not going to debate you when you clearly don't see anything terribly miraculous about life. I guess quantum physics doesn't allow for miracles.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	No, thermodynamic miracles are--
F	LAURIE	Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish. The structure descends. Laurie stomps down the stairs.
F	LAURIE	That's it then. You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all the other worthless humans. And look, you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears and see? Not a damp eye in the house. Maybe you're wrong about everything. Jon is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Laurie. You complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms. And yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective. If only you'd try to see the whole continuum, life's pattern, you'd understand. But you deliberately shut it out as if afraid to see.
F	LAURIE	I'm not afraid, okay? You want me to see things your way? Go ahead, do that thing you do. She stands there, arms folded, waiting. Then, just like
F	SALLY	You wanted to hear it, so I'm telling you, okay?. Magic! Dreams! That's what I had before. I was a hero goddammit!
M	LAURIE'S FATHER	It's not my fault you got old! What do you have to complain about?! I'm putting food on the table for you and your child. Why don't you give your friend Eddie a call? Maybe he can give you a better life!
F	SALLY	It was a mistake--one time! Am I never-- And then they notice Laurie looking at them.
F	LAURIE	Mommy?
F	SALLY	Oh. Oh, Laurie
M	CONTINUED:	Tears run down little Laurie's face. Her parents are
F	LAURIE	No. No, no, no, no not him
M	DR. MANHATTAN	The comedian was your father.
F	LAURIE	But he--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Attacked your mother. Yes. Two years later he came back to her, to make amends. And you were conceived on that day. Laurie WHIPS a BOTTLE at the palace-- Jon's eyes SHUT. He seems to feel . empathy. A TEAR slips
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	The comedian is my father. I guess my life is just one big joke.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I don't think your life is a joke.
F	LAURIE	Well, of course you're going to say that.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	But I've changed my mind. There are miracles in your world that are worth preserving.
F	LAURIE	What? But you were saying--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I tried to explain. Thermodynamic miracles--events with odds against so astronomical, like oxygen turning into gold. I have longed to witness such a thing and yet I neglect that in human coupling, millions upon millions of cells compete to create life over generation after generation: Until finally, your mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the Comedian--a man she has every reason to hate. And out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from all of that chaos; Your creation is like . turning air into gold. A miracle.
F	LAURIE	But if my birth is a miracle you, you could say that about anyone.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, anyone in the world. But the world is so crowded with miracles that they become commonplace and we forget. I forget. They stand there in silence. Connected for the first time in Now. Dry your eyes. FROM ABOVE: We see the full CRATER--the ARGYRE PLANITIA.
M	DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)(CONT'D)	And let's go home.
M	DAN	I've got a large reading ahead. Anything that's emitting that much heat out here, must be a pretty big facility. Adrian. We're not going to make it, are we? Rorschach says nothing . when a halting WHINE sputters
F	RORSCHACH	The engines--
M	DAN	They're icing up, hold on! Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.
M	DAN	We just lost the engines--find something to grab on to! The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS
M	DAN	The engines are de-icing. You sure I can't fit you with something warmer?
F	RORSCHACH	Fine like this. Adrian sighs and hits the remote--the screens become ONE
F	ADRIAN	See this painting? Alexander the Great. Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he struck North for Gordium, where the world's greatest puzzle waited. A great knot, impossible to untie. For a young man determined to rule the world, it was a challenge he couldn't resist. So he sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral thinking, you see. Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	What is it, girl? He hits the remote--the TV screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Ah. It's all right, girl. Everything's all right. --sees KARNAK, a GARGANTUAN GLASS PYRAMID, rising out of the
F	ADRIAN	Really, getting even this far is an admirable effort, given their limitations. Of course the ice they're skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep themselves. On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Let's hope they know when to stop. I don't understand any of this. Adrian's a pacifist. He's never killed anyone in his life. He's a vegetarian for Christ's sake!
F	RORSCHACH	Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get a second chance.
F	ADRIAN	Mind your manners. Dan draws his PEN-LASER.
M	DAN	Adrian, don't make me-- Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan
F	ADRIAN	Now. What can I do for you?
M	DAN	You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon!
F	ADRIAN	Yes.
M	DAN	Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do?
F	ADRIAN	What we always intended--to improve the world. As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a I never intended to kill the Comedian-- that was an accident. Part of his duties as a government operative was to keep track of all former masked heroes, make sure there was no rocking of the boat. He must have liked Rorschach because he allowed him to continue to exist. I had thought that the Comedian might be incompetent, but he disproved that hypothesis when he discovered what was really going on. here in Karnak--no easy task. Even my staff was unaware--I made sure to keep each department separate.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but still, he understood the scope of what I was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I never thought he'd actually talk. But by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. So I had to kill him.
F	ADRIAN	After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan nearly a decade in the works after analyzing confidential psychological profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence. By then, Rorschach's mask theory, 'though erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I faked my own assassination--
M	DAN	Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant?
F	ADRIAN	I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to catch the bullet then, wouldn't I? Adrian smiles enigmatically.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	After apprehending my own assassin, I shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth, disposing of him, and soon after that, the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all the loose ends if you will. Then I knew nothing stood in the way of my triumph.
M	DAN	Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do?
F	ADRIAN	I'm firing a beam of concentrated energy, synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself, into the hearts of nine key regions around the globe, crossing all traditional politics and ideologies;
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Paris, Tehran, Kashmir, Beijing, Taiwan, Pyongyang, London, Jerusalem, New York-- destroying approximately three million people.
M	DAN	Three million people? You're joking.
F	RORSCHACH	He's not. Listen to his voice.
M	DAN	Rorschach, he's making it up!
F	ADRIAN	I understand your disbelief, Dan. When I began the plan ten years ago, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct. What we were doing with the Watchmen was pointless--the savage nature of humankind would inevitably lead to the end of the world. So in order to save the world, I had to trick it--to frighten the world towards salvation with history's greatest practical joke.
M	DAN	By killing millions of people? And when were you planning on doing this?
F	ADRIAN	When? Dan, my dear friend, I am the smartest man in the world--do you seriously think I'd explain my master stroke if there remained even the slightest chance of you affecting it's outcome? I did it thirty minutes ago.
M	DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)	
M	DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)	
M	DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)	
M	CONTINUED:	(WORLD MONTAGE): --as is the News Vendor; the Pakistani and
F	LAURIE	God Jon, what was that? Jon looks around the street. Even he is awe-struck.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Interference. Cataclysmic interference.
F	LAURIE	Was it a war? It doesn't seem like--
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Not a war. I .don't know what it was. Dr. Manhattan looks up into the sky, studying it.
F	LAURIE	Take me out of here, Jon. Please.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry. This must be very upsetting for you. I have traced the source of the Tachyon particles to Antarctica. Shall we?
F	LAURIE	Anywhere. Anywhere's better than here.
M	DAN	God. God, he
F	RORSCHACH	Impersonated Dr. Manhattan. Murdered millions of people. Call off your cat. Call off your cat and face me!
F	ADRIAN	Don't you understand? I've ended the war-- I've ended all wars. Because of their fear of ion, I've forced the world into everlasting peace.
M	DAN	By committing the biggest mass murder in history. You have no right to play God!
F	ADRIAN	I wasn't playing God. Just Dr. Manhattan. Suddenly there's a LOUD BEEPING in the hall. The Lynx growls.
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	Speak of the devil.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Adrian, of course. Who else would have the resources
F	LAURIE	Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you saying he's responsible for this-- Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago
F	LAURIE	What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon don't start that crap now, not here!
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow him
M	INSIDE	In a burst, he's gone.
F	RORSCHACH	No, don't let him escape!
M	DAN	Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people, who knows what else he'll do. Jon walks calmly after Adrian.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Jon, are you okay? You seem drugged.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago
M	DAN	What? Where's Laurie?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow him
M	INSIDE	Jon follows Adrian into the next room.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Adrian, don't be foolish. Even if I can't predict where I'm going to find you, I can turn the walls to glass. The tachyons were clever but it's time to give up Jon spots the Lynx in a METAL CORRIDOR.
M	DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)	Very well. If I must, let us follow this through to the bitter end. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS is Adrian, waiting by a
F	ADRIAN	Forgive me, girl. Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Adrian? Adrian, don't-- LIGHT BLASTS through Jon and the Lynx--both are OBLITERATED.
F	ADRIAN	You know, I really wasn't sure that would work. Adrian turns. Laurie aims the prison guard's pistol at him.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	You're such an asshole. Adrian cries out, LEAPS at her as she FIRES--
M	DAN	Laurie, shoot him again! Adrian's hand falls from his chest to the floor, blood --holding a BULLET inside.
F	LAURIE	Oh shit. Adrian opens his eyes and KICKS her in the stomach, sending
M	DAN	LAURIE! If you've hurt her, I'll--
F	ADRIAN	Oh Dan. Grow up. Adrian exits as Dan helps the winded Laurie to her feet. Jon, now 100 FEET TALL, SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL. Adrian
M	DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)	Restructuring myself was the first trick I learned! It didn't kill me before, did you seriously think it would kill me now? You are nothing but a man. And the world's smartest man means no more to me than its smartest termite! Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote.
M	DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)	What is that, Adrian? Some new, ultimate weapon?
F	ADRIAN	Yes. Yes, you could say that. Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news
M	ADRIAN (CONT'D)	I did it. I DID IT! I've saved Earth from Hell. Next, I will elevate her to the vaulting stature of Heaven.
F	LAURIE	Next? You can't get away with this!
F	ADRIAN	No? Will you expose me, undoing the peace so many have just died for? Morally, you're in checkmate, just like the Comedian was. Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
M	DAN	He's right. All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth.
F	LAURIE	We we can't say anything about this
F	RORSCHACH	You're joking, of course. Rorschach walks toward the exit.
M	DAN	Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this out!
F	RORSCHACH	Never. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise. Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing
M	DAN	Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Where are you going, Rorschach?
F	RORSCHACH	Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America. People must be told. Evil must be punished.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Rorschach, you know I can't let you do that. Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach
F	RORSCHACH	Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of this would have happened. So what are you waiting for? Do it. Jon WAVES HIS HAND and BLOWS RORSCHACH APART. Dan collapses
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one a little less complicated.
F	LAURIE	Leaving? I, I thought you regained an interest in human life.
M	DR. MANHATTAN	I have. I think maybe I'll create some. Goodbye, Laurie. He kisses her on the cheek--
F	ADRIAN	Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made myself feel every death, see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity--you understand, don't you?
M	DR. MANHATTAN	Without condoning or condemning, I
M	UNDERSTAND	And with that, he disappears. Forever. Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach. He
F	ADRIAN	What's on your mind, Dan?
M	DAN	Your death.
F	ADRIAN	Really. You want to kill me?
M	DAN	Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you've done.
F	ADRIAN	That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That sounds more like Rorschach.
M	DAN	Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV
F	ADRIAN	Only you're not Rorschach, are you now? How do you expect to succeed where he failed?
M	DAN	Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't. Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with
F	LAURIE	Dan! Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her Dan falls to his knees, bloody and beaten. Out of tricks, out Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs.
F	ADRIAN	I have to say, I've always thought your choice of an owl was quite juvenile.
M	DAN	Really? I've always liked owls Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	because you can never hear them coming. BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL-
F	ADRIAN	I . don't regret my actions. I know in my heart . I did the right thing.
M	DAN	So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies.
M	DAN	That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out
M	DAN (CONT'D)	Now, the thrusters . There. She HITS THE THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room. Sally Jupiter walks the sidewalk, looking for an address.
F	SALLY	You sure you don't want a drink?
M	LAURIE (O.S.)	I'm okay. Thanks. We finally see Laurie now--her hair dyed, appearance changed. Mom--I just want to get this out of the way . . I know Eddie Blake, the Comedian--I know he was my father. Sally freezes.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	I remember. Sally downs her drink, immediately starts making another.
F	SALLY	It, it was years later, he stopped by out of the blue, and, and apologized. I don't know, I just couldn't stay mad. It just happened-- Laurie kisses her mother's teary cheek.
F	LAURIE	Mom. People's lives take them strange places. You never did anything wrong by me. Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.
F	SALLY	What the hell is that?
F	LAURIE	Oh that's Dan. Home from "work." The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the
M	DAN	Oh hi.
F	SALLY	Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up. Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom.
F	LAURIE	Any bad guys last night?
M	DAN	There are always bad guys. Even in today's world. Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York
F	LAURIE	Dan.
M	DAN	Hmm?
F	LAURIE	Will it be alright? The world, I mean. He puts his arm around her shoulder.
M	DAN	As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian was behind it all, the public will think ion is still up there, watching.
M	DAN (CONT'D)	The threat remains, and everything should be fine.
F	LAURIE	Yeah. Just fine
M	EDITOR	SEYMOUR! What the hell do you got for me?
M	EDITOR	We got nothing to write about. Everyone in the country, every country in the world is holding hands now, singing songs about peace and love--it's like we're living in a goddamn global hippie commune !
M	SEYMOUR	Um, I guess I can look for stuff in the crank file.
M	EDITOR	Crank file? Whatever! Take some initiative! Run whatever you like-- Seymour turns to the PILE of submissions known as the crank
M	EDITOR (CONT'D)	--I leave it entirely in your hands. --and picks up Rorschach's Journal . Just as he's about
