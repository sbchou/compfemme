M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MAE	Are you somebody?
M	MAN	No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.
M	MAE	Hi, Rupert.
M	CELESTE	Hello, Rupert.
M	SIDNEY	Who did you get?
M	PUPKIN	Nobody.
M	MAE	I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.
M	CELESTE	He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.
M	MAE	Then I got him again at the Pierre at four o'clock.
M	SIDNEY	Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen to have Mr. Vallone.
M	MAE	You know what I want for him.
M	SIDNEY	But I have only six Barbra's left. You know how difficult she is to work with.
M	MAE	I don't have her even once.
M	CELESTE	Maybe Rupert would help you.
M	SIDNEY	Would you do that, Rupert? You don't feel about Barbra the way I do.
M	MAE	I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.
M	CELESTE	Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do that sort of thing.
M	SIDNEY	How about it, Rupert? I'll give you whoever you want.
M	SIDNEY	Rodney Dangerfield ... Richard Harris ... Liza Minelli ... and she's not so easy to work with either ... Louise Lasser!
M	CELESTE	You're wasting your time.
M	PUPKIN	Look, Sidney. I'm just not interested. This isn't my whole life, you know.
M	CELESTE	What's that supposed to mean -- that it's my whole life, or Sidney's or Mae's?
M	MAE	It is so my whole life.
M	CELESTE	Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn't she part of your life?
M	MAE	It's her whole life too.
M	POLICEMAN	If you want Jerry's autograph, give me your piece of paper and I'll send it backstage.
M	PUPKIN	What are you going to do with Jerry's autograph?
M	YOUNG GIRL	I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.
M	BOYFRIEND	I'll tell you what she's going to do with it. She's going to pin
M	it on her bulletin board and	have an orgasm.
M	CHAUFFEUR	No, Mae.
M	MAE	I don't mean now.
M	CHAUFFEUR	No, Mae.
M	MAE	I'll get right out.
M	MAE	But I've never been in one.
M	PUPKIN	How the hell did that girl get in there? Jesus, they certainly don't give you very good protection, do they?
M	PUPKIN	Look at you here. Who the hell is watching you? Any one of these freaks could just walk right up to you and do whatever he wants.
M	FIRST GIRL	Oh, Jerry. How can we get to talk to you?
M	PUPKIN	Just a minute. This is crazy.
M	PUPKIN	Okay! Stand back!
M	PUPKIN	Didn't you hear me?!? Come on, people, have a heart.
M	PUPKIN	Stand back! (To LANGFORD) Go ahead, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Thanks. Thanks very much.
M	PUPKIN	I hate to bother you like this, Jerry, but could I speak to you for a minute.
M	LANGFORD	I'd like to but ...
M	PUPKIN	I know you're a busy man. I promise not to take very long, really. But I need your advice.
M	PUPKIN	You don't have a handkerchief, do you? Jesus, these people will kill you for a cufflink.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I don't mind talking as we drive. You can drop me off anywhere.
M	LANGFORD	Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...
M	PUPKIN	I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.
M	LANGFORD	I'll let you know.
M	PUPKIN	Really? Fine. I'm Rupert Pupkin, Jerry. I know that the name itself doesn't mean very much to you but it means an awful lot to me, believe me. Maybe you've seen me Well, right now, I'm in communications but, by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry, believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably wondering if I'm so good why haven't you caught my act somewhere, right?
M	LANGFORD	Well ...
M	PUPKIN	Well, up to now, I've been biding my time, developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally comes, I'm ready -- like you were that night Paar got sick and you sat in for him. I was there that night, in the theater. That was the most important night of my life, until tonight, of course.
M	LANGFORD	No thanks. I don't smoke.
M	PUPKIN	Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy. How about a cough drop?
M	LANGFORD	No thanks. I don't cough.
M	PUPKIN	I try not to but sometimes, you know ... Am I making any sense?
M	LANGFORD	Go on.
M	PUPKIN	Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered
M	the jokes without leaning too much on	them, without saying "here's the punchline, folks." And I watched the way you played off dead audiences, how you let those long silences build until people couldn't stand it and then the way you got them off the hook with that slow smile. You were my college of comedy, Jerry, like a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it sounds crazy, but when you watch someone every night ... But that's all in the past. What I'm trying to say is this. I'm ready now. I've finished the course. And I'm thinking as we sit here talking "Is this it? Is this that one big break?" Is it, Jerry?
M	PUPKIN	Jerry?
M	LANGFORD	Look ... er ... what was the name?
M	PUPKIN	I'm Rupert, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying. But things don't work that way. You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience. You've got to start at the bottom ...
M	PUPKIN	But that's where I am!
M	LANGFORD	You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs.
M	PUPKIN	But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me. I'm already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I've got some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking you to do is listen to my act. That's all. Is that asking too much?
M	LANGFORD	I get calls from agents every day. All they want ...
M	PUPKIN	I tried getting an agent. I did, Jerry. agent unless you're working and you can't get work unless you've got an agent ... or unless you know somebody. And the only person I know is you, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Look, why don't you call my office.
M	PUPKIN	Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that, Jerry. You don't know how many times I've had this conversation in my head. And this is the way it always turns out. That's why I had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you've given me. But breaks like this don't just happen. You have to make your own breaks.
M	LANGFORD	Nice meeting you, Rupert. I hope it all works out for you.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay you. I'm a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don't mind some good, hearty food, I'd be honored to take you to dinner.
M	LANGFORD	Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.
M	PUPKIN	Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could repay you with a joke.
M	PUPKIN	Wait a minute. How's this? The first night you do your show from the coast, you open this way. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be back here in
M	LANGFORD	Not bad. Maybe.
M	PUPKIN	Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry! How about lunch? My treat!
M	LANGFORD	Call my office.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks, Jerry.
M	VINCENT	I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN, angrily) How did you get in?
M	LANGFORD	That's alright, Vincent. Mr. Pupkin's a friend of mine.
M	VINCENT	Oh, I see.
M	PUPKIN	That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough to find us a nice table.
M	VINCENT	Certainly. This way, please.
M	VINCENT	Here you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.
M	LANGFORD	Is Eddie here today, Vincent?
M	VINCENT	I'll send him over.
M	WAITER	Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.
M	PUPKIN	Sounds like a new opera.
M	LANGFORD	Fine. What comes with it?
M	WAITER	Me.
M	PUPKIN	Fine. For two.
M	WAITER	Very good.
M	PUPKIN	You look tired, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	It shows, does it? It's all these problems with the show. That and the custody suit.
M	PUPKIN	I was sorry to read about that, Jerry. Charlene never should have gotten the kids. If there's anything I can do.
M	LANGFORD	I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about it a little with you helps.
M	PUPKIN	Hasn't Eddie already done you?
M	LANGFORD	Never mind. You were saying ...
M	PUPKIN	Well, I've been giving a lot of thought to your situation, Jerry, ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings. And I think I know what the problem is. Too many of the same faces.
M	LANGFORD	Yeah?
M	PUPKIN	Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really do anything. They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore.
M	LANGFORD	You know, maybe you're right, Rube.
M	PUPKIN	I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of surprises, it loses its audience.
M	PUPKIN	What's your name, dear?
M	GIRL	Dolores.
M	PUPKIN	To Dolores, who sensed greatness. Rupert Pupkin.
M	GIRL	Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
M	PUPKIN	You see what I mean? What you need on the show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant talent making his television debut. Imagine the suspense. Who is this young guy? How will he do with the eyes of all America on him? Something like that has got to help.
M	LANGFORD	And that's where you come in.
M	PUPKIN	Why not? Believe me, Jerry, I'd give you the credit you deserve and I'll stick with you. Anytime you need me, I'll be there, doing a few minutes at Guild scale.
M	LANGFORD	I'd be grateful, Rube. I really would.
M	EDDIE	All finished, Mr. Langford.
M	PUPKIN	Oh, Jerry, you sneaky ...
M	LANGFORD	Looks good, Eddie.
M	PUPKIN	What's this?
M	WAITER	Compliments of Mr. Sardi.
M	PUPKIN'S VOICE	How does your afternoon look?
M	LANGFORD'S VOICE	What have you got in mind?
M	PUPKIN'S VOICE	Well, we've still got time to catch the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.
M	LANGFORD'S VOICE	Why not? But first, a toast. To you, Rube and your success.
M	PUPKIN'S VOICE	Thanks, Jerry.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Say hello to Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Say hello to Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Yeah.
M	GIRL'S VOICE	It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note? I left it on the back seat. Did you get it? I dropped it there before they pulled me out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause) Jerry?
M	LANGFORD	Who gave you this number?
M	MARSHA'S VOICE	Don't be angry with me, Jerry. I didn't know what else to do; I've been trying you every five minutes, I miss you, baby ... Jerry?
M	PUPKIN	Miss!
M	PUPKIN	A beer please, Miss. Something imported.
F	RITA	Heineken's alright?
M	PUPKIN	Fine.
M	PUPKIN	How have you been, Rita?
F	RITA	You're not Rupert Pupkin!
F	RITA	How the hell did you find me?
M	PUPKIN	Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee. Aren't you glad to see me?
F	RITA	Sure, sure. How is old Sally?
M	PUPKIN	The same, I guess. You know, two kids, a nice husband, living in Clifton.
F	RITA	It figures.
M	PUPKIN	A lot of the kids in our class have moved back.
F	RITA	What are you doing here?
M	PUPKIN	I just thought I'd say hello. Here, I brought you a little something.
F	RITA	Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.
M	PUPKIN	Don't forget to put in an aspirin. It lasts longer.
F	RITA	Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.
M	PUPKIN	How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?
F	RITA	I don't have an aspirin.
M	PUPKIN	Maybe a Rolaids would work.
F	RITA	Well, what are you up to these days, Rupert?
M	PUPKIN	Didn't you know you'd see me again?
F	RITA	You still going to the movies?
M	PUPKIN	You're looking as beautiful as ever.
F	RITA	Oh, yeah. I was a real knockout.
M	PUPKIN	I thought so.
F	RITA	Well, here I am. Local cheerleader makes good.
M	PUPKIN	I voted for you for Most Beautiful.
F	RITA	Yeah?
M	PUPKIN	I didn't have the nerve to tell you then, but I guess it's alright now.
F	RITA	Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen, if that's what you mean.
F	RITA	Well, how are things with you, Rupert?
M	PUPKIN	Great! Everything's starting to break.
F	RITA	Is that right?
M	PUPKIN	Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here. I've known about this place for a long time. I just didn't want to make my move until I had something to offer you. Everything's a question of timing.
M	PUPKIN	What's the matter?
F	RITA	Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!
M	PUPKIN	The two of us are often confused. He's the one with the famous father.
M	PUPKIN	You like this place?
F	RITA	Why, you got something better?
M	PUPKIN	Maybe.
F	RITA	What?
M	PUPKIN	What are you doing tonight?
F	RITA	Tonight?
M	PUPKIN	What's so funny?
F	RITA	You call me up all junior and senior year. Night after night after night, right? And every time I'm wondering 'when is this guy going to stop talking and ask me out?' Well, now I know the answer. August twelfth, nineteen seventy-six. It only took you ten, eleven years to work up to it.
M	PUPKIN	If I had asked you out? Would you have gone?
F	RITA	Oh, no.
M	PUPKIN	Why not?
F	RITA	Because I thought you were a jerk!
M	PUPKIN	You see! I was right! But that guy isn't me anymore. I look at my picture in the yearbook and I don't even recognize myself. I'm not the same guy, Rita.
M	MAN	Rita!
F	RITA	Excuse me a minute, honey.
M	PUPKIN	I'm not honey! I'm Rupert.
M	PUPKIN	Miss! Miss!
M	PUPKIN	I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight. Why don't we go to this nice restaurant I know, talk over and times, get to know each other all over again.
F	RITA	And then?
M	PUPKIN	Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd go out again, talk some more, get to know each other even better.
F	RITA	How much?
M	PUPKIN	How much what?
F	RITA	How much do we have to get to know each other?
M	PUPKIN	I don't understand.
F	RITA	How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job?
M	PUPKIN	I'm not talking about any job.
F	RITA	Then what's this big offer you were talking about?
M	PUPKIN	You'll see. Right now I'm asking you for a date. How about it?
F	RITA	I'm sorry, Rupert. But I'm busy.
M	PUPKIN	Busy?
F	RITA	Yeah. Busy.
M	PUPKIN	But this is the biggest night of my life.
F	RITA	I've already got a date.
M	MAN	Rita!
M	PUPKIN	Miss! Miss!
M	PUPKIN	Is that your date?
F	RITA	None of your business.
M	PUPKIN	What do you want to go out with him for?
F	RITA	He's a good friend of mine.
M	PUPKIN	Tell him you're busy.
F	RITA	What's so important about tonight?
M	PUPKIN	Everything! You don't understand.
F	RITA	No. I don't. It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I've got some work to do.
M	PUPKIN	Miss!
M	PUPKIN	Listen to me for a second.
F	RITA	I have work to do, Rupert.
M	PUPKIN	Just listen. I'm at the start of something really big. I don't want to talk about it here but it's going to happen soon and it's going to be great -- for both of us.
F	RITA	No kidding?
M	PUPKIN	So see that guy some other night.
M	MAN	Rita!
M	PUPKIN	But I haven't finished!
M	PUPKIN	Miss! Miss!
F	RITA	I'll get you another one. Look, friend. I'm trying to have a nice civilized conversation with the young lady. Be a good little lad, huh, and give us a break.
M	PUPKIN	Miss! Miss!
M	MAN	C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can kick your ass outta here.
F	RITA	He was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor.
M	COOK	Okay, buddy, here we go.
F	RITA	Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?
F	RITA	Another one, Chan.
M	PUPKIN	Chopsticks, please.
F	RITA	So all this time you've been thinking about me, huh?
M	PUPKIN	That's right, Rita.
F	RITA	What kinds of things were you thinking?
F	RITA	Oh, ho! Those kinds of things! Shame on you, Rupert.
F	RITA	Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Rita. People will hear.
F	RITA	Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh, come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.
M	PUPKIN	This is a very important evening to me, Rita.
F	RITA	Did you know your nose wiggled when you talked?
M	PUPKIN	It does?
F	RITA	Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit. (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or what? I'm starving.
F	RITA	It always looks like they put worms in this stuff.
M	PUPKIN	Just taste.
F	RITA	Well, I guess it won't kill me.
M	PUPKIN	Cantonese cuisine in the city.
F	RITA	Yeah? Then what happened to the tablecloths?
F	RITA	Oh, don't worry about it. This is
M	fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm	having a good time. So you've been devoted to me, huh?
M	PUPKIN	I used to see you at the Garden every year.
F	RITA	Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny.
M	PUPKIN	You just didn't get the breaks.
F	RITA	Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make?
F	RITA	I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up.
M	PUPKIN	I liked the show.
F	RITA	Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married?
M	PUPKIN	I knew it wouldn't last.
F	RITA	You think I should have married you, instead, huh?
M	PUPKIN	Peter Drysdale! Really, Rita! He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that.
M	PUPKIN	Are you seeing anyone?
F	RITA	What do you mean?
M	PUPKIN	I want to know about the competition, that's all.
F	RITA	Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And Thursday --- let's see --
M	PUPKIN	I'm serious, Rita.
F	RITA	I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice) Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people.
M	PUPKIN	Anyone special?
F	RITA	You mean am I "going steady"? Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old!
M	PUPKIN	What about that guy tonight?
F	RITA	Him?
M	PUPKIN	Why him?
F	RITA	What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all.
M	PUPKIN	You don't go out with him for his money?!?
F	RITA	Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of me.
M	PUPKIN	That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita.
M	PUPKIN	Who's your favorite movie star?
F	RITA	You are, Rupert. Especially your nose.
M	PUPKIN	Just tell me.
F	RITA	Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my character?
M	PUPKIN	You'll see. Give me his name.
F	RITA	I can't think of anybody.
M	PUPKIN	You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody does.
F	RITA	Marilyn Monroe.
F	RITA	Oh, Rupert! Are we going to exchange
F	RITA	That's her name.
M	PUPKIN	Her name! She signed this herself, especially for me.
M	PUPKIN	She wasn't a great actress but she had a real gift for comedy. She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many of the world's most beautiful women. I'm going to see that doesn't happen to you, Rita.
F	RITA	Who's this one?
M	PUPKIN	Burt Reynolds.
F	RITA	Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes. Who's this?
M	PUPKIN	Mel Brooks.
F	RITA	And this?
M	PUPKIN	Carol Burnett.
F	RITA	No kidding. How about this?
M	PUPKIN	Glenda Jackson.
F	RITA	Never heard of her.
M	PUPKIN	And that's Woody Allen and there's one's Lauren Bacall.
F	RITA	You don't really know any of these people?
M	PUPKIN	Take a look at this.
F	RITA	I can't make it out.
M	PUPKIN	Try.
F	RITA	This is really weird handwriting!
M	PUPKIN	Rooooper ....
F	RITA	Redford!
M	PUPKIN	That's Robert Redford.
F	RITA	It is?
M	PUPKIN	No! It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin
M	PUPKIN	Don't lose it. It's going to be worth something in a couple of weeks.
M	PUPKIN	That's what I've been trying to tell you. Things are really breaking for me. I'm ticketed for stardom.
M	PUPKIN	Only a couple of hours ago, I was talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry Langford. Stop it, Rita!
M	PUPKIN	We were talking about my doing my act on his show.
F	RITA	Your act?
M	PUPKIN	Get that guy you knew from Clifton out of your head right now. You're looking at Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin, the new King of Comedy.
F	RITA	I'm sorry.
M	PUPKIN	Why not me, Rita? A guy can always get what he wants if he's willing to pay the price. All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break. If you've got a friend in the right place, that's all it takes. And that's exactly what I have going for me right now. After all, crazier things have happened.
M	PUPKIN	You just don't realize what a shot on the Langford Show can mean. That's coast to coast, national TV, a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime. A shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett. And you've always got those other talk shows to fall back on -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita -- Hollywood! That's when we really start a beach house in Malibu, right on the ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan, believe me. And we'd keep a suite at the Sherry. That's the only place to stay when you're big. We could get something on a top floor and look down on all our old friends in Clifton and just laugh. How does that sound to you?
F	RITA	It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I really hope you get what you want. But it's getting late and I'm a working girl. You know what I mean?
M	PUPKIN	You going to spend the rest of your life in that place? Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with nothings? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and that's what I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen, Rita. I want you to be mine. What do you say?
F	RITA	You really want to help me out? You see this. (She points to her lower back molar) A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy -- me, my landlord and my dentist.
M	WAITER	Telephone for you, Miss.
F	RITA	Me? Nobody knows I'm here. You didn't tell anybody, did you?
M	PUPKIN	No.
F	RITA	What the hell's going on?
F	RITA	Hello?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Hi.
F	RITA	Who is this?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Who do you think it is? I've been staring at you all evening.
F	RITA	Where are you?
F	RITA	You know who that was -- the bar. I have to go back to work.
M	PUPKIN	How did they know you were here?
F	RITA	I guess I must have told them. They need someone right away.
M	PUPKIN	You don't even care, do you?
F	RITA	Oh, no. I do. Really!
M	PUPKIN	It's not the bar, Rita. Don't tell me it's the bar. do with you. I had a nice dinner, really. It was great seeing you again.
F	RITA	Come on. Let's see a smile.
M	PUPKIN	Why don't we finish the evening up at the bar together? End the evening where it began?
F	RITA	After what happened there?
M	PUPKIN	Well, I could at least drop you off!
F	RITA	That's okay. Really. I can manage. Why don't you just go to a movie or something? Don't let me spoil your evening.
M	PUPKIN	But that wouldn't be right.
F	RITA	Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun, really. I'll see you sometime, huh?
M	PUPKIN	But Rita!
F	RITA	Come on, Rupert. I'm in a hurry.
M	YOUNG MAN	Welcome to the pleasure dome.
F	RITA	You don't kid around, do you?
M	YOUNG MAN	I do alright. What's your libation?
F	RITA	Huh?
M	YOUNG MAN	Your potion. Your drink.
F	RITA	Bourbon and soda. Make it light.
M	YOUNG MAN	You from the South?
F	RITA	Me?
M	YOUNG MAN	That's what Southern people drink. Lots of bourbon.
F	RITA	What do people from Jersey drink?
M	YOUNG MAN	I make it a point to study things like that. It's important to know people's backgrounds, their tastes, their culture. It gives you a little head start.
M	YOUNG MAN	I'm Chet. Whom do I have the pleasure of serving?
F	RITA	I'm Mary.
M	YOUNG MAN	Pleased to meat you, Mary. (He lifts his glass) To our evening.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Who?
M	PUPKIN	Rita Keane. I want to talk to her.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Rita Keane?
M	PUPKIN	That's right. Oh, never mind. I must have the wrong apartment.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	There's no Rita here.
M	PUPKIN	I know. I know. I'm sorry to bother you.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	You must have the wrong apartment.
M	YOUNG MAN	Leisure is America's fastest growing industry. Did you know that? Think about it. Short work weeks, more vacation. People need something to do with all that time and that's where I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc. We buy land an hour or so outside your metropolitan centers. We set up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay out a golf course, you know, fix the whole place up so it's usable. Then young, personable guys like me show the people around. It the guy seems tight, we point out the investment factor. If he's a swinger, well, the bungalows are very private. If he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis.
M	YOUNG MAN	What's your work, Mary?
F	RITA	Me. I fly for National.
M	YOUNG MAN	No kidding?
F	RITA	What's that smell?
M	YOUNG MAN	Sandalwood incense. It seemed very you.
M	PUPKIN	I said I'm sorry!
M	YOUNG MAN	Did you know that you have remarkable hair?
F	RITA	Yeah? You know what? I feel like going to a movie.
M	YOUNG MAN	Now?
F	RITA	Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of ten. We can make a ten o'clock show.
M	YOUNG MAN	Why don't we make our own movie?
F	RITA	No. I don't think so.
M	YOUNG MAN	Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance.
F	RITA	I want to go to the movies, that's all.
M	YOUNG MAN	We can go to the movies later.
F	RITA	Let's stop playing games, okay. I'm not a kid.
M	YOUNG MAN	You have something against pleasure? tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay?
M	YOUNG MAN	Shall I freshen up your drink?
M	YOUNG MAN	What exactly did you think we were going to do up here?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Yeah?
M	YOUNG MAN	Look, if you've got sexual problems let's talk about them. It helps clear the air.
F	RITA	There's nothing wrong with me.
M	YOUNG MAN	Then it's me?
F	RITA	I don't even know you.
M	YOUNG MAN	Then find out. Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers.
F	RITA	I don't think so.
M	YOUNG MAN	I'm sure this could lead to something beautiful.
M	YOUNG MAN	Passive resistance, huh?
F	RITA	Let's just write this thing off as a big mistake. What do you say?
M	YOUNG MAN	What's wrong with me?
F	RITA	Nothing. I just want to go home.
M	YOUNG MAN	I can see I'm not turning you on.
F	RITA	You noticed that, huh?
M	YOUNG MAN	Come on. What's wrong with me?
F	RITA	You really want to know?
M	YOUNG MAN	Yeah.
F	RITA	How can I put it? Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out.
M	YOUNG MAN	I'm really a very sensitive person.
F	RITA	Come on. Get offa me.
M	YOUNG MAN	Sometimes I write poetry.
F	RITA	No!
M	YOUNG MAN	So you wanna play hard to get, huh?
M	OLD LADY'S VOICE	¿ Que es, por favor?
F	RITA	Come on. Let's talk this over.
M	YOUNG MAN	I admire you very much. I respect you, Mary.
F	RITA	You're hurting me.
M	YOUNG MAN	I'm only doing what you want.
F	RITA	Oh, please.
M	YOUNG MAN	Afterwards, you'll thank me.
M	PUPKIN	Rita!
F	RITA	What do you want?
M	PUPKIN	Don't be angry with me. I was worried about you, that's all.
F	RITA	Just go home and leave me alone.
M	PUPKIN	Here. You'll need this. It's getting chilly.
F	RITA	I'm so bad. I'm such a dummy.
M	PUPKIN	Don't say that, Rita. Everyone does crazy things.
F	RITA	Not all the time.
M	PUPKIN	I'll get us a cab.
M	CAB DRIVER'S VOICE	Stuff it, big spender!
F	RITA	Well, I guess you're entitled to come up for coffee.
M	PUPKIN	That's okay, Rita. You're tired and I know I'm not always the easiest guy to be with.
F	RITA	What do you want, Rupert?
M	PUPKIN	You don't understand anything, do you? I love you, Rita. I want to change your life ... if you'll only give me a chance.
M	PUPKIN	Look, what if I arranged it so you could meet Jerry? You'd have to believe me if you heard it from him.
F	RITA	There's no ...
M	PUPKIN	I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place, on a weekend. You'll see. The trouble with you is you've got no faith. Now go to bed and get a good rest and I'll see you in a couple of days.
M	PUPKIN	Now run along in.
M	PUPKIN	Go on.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Yes.
M	PUPKIN	I need somebody to sign. You can sign anything you want -- Cary Grant, Art Carney, I don't care.
M	PUPKIN	Would you mind very much if I used your phone? It's local.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Don't be, long. Dial nine.
M	PUPKIN	May I speak to Jerry Langford, please? Thanks ... Jerry Langford, please. Rupert Pupkin ... Jerry knows. I'm calling at his request ... I see. That's alright. I'll call him again.
M	RECEPTIONIST	That's not Jerry Langford, the ...
M	PUPKIN	
M	PUPKIN	Jerry Langford, please ... May I speak to Jerry Langford, please ... Rupert Pupkin, I called earlier ... I see. How long do you expect that'll last? Oh, fine. I'm at (PUPKIN checks the number on the phone) CH 4-1482 ... I'll be here for another half hour, forty- five minutes. Please be sure he gets my message. Thanks.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Yes sir?
M	PUPKIN	Mr. Langford, please.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Your name?
M	PUPKIN	Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.
M	PUPKIN	You know the secret of dieting, Jerry? Grapefruit. It's good for you. It's filling. And it's low in calories.
M	LANGFORD	Take note of that, you ladies.
M	PUPKIN	As a matter of fact, yesterday I went to the outdoor market near where I live and I bought twenty grapefruit. The grocer looked at me and said, "What are you gonna do with all those?" So I bent over and told him (in a confidential tone) "I'm gonna take 'em back to Florida and set 'em free!"
M	RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry, Mr. Pupkin, but Mr. Langford's secretary has no record of any appointment.
M	PUPKIN	Pardon me?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Mr. Langford's secretary has no record of any appointment.
M	PUPKIN	Well, technically speaking, I don't actually have an appointment. Jerry asked me to call him today and when I couldn't get through, I thought ...
M	RECEPTIONIST	I see. (Into the phone) He says Mr. Langford asked him to call. (To PUPKIN) Mr. Langford's secretary wants to know what this is in reference to.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Would you mind talking to her yourself?
M	PUPKIN	Hello? ... Jerry and I discussed my being on the show last night and he told me to call ... No. I don't mind.
M	PUPKIN	I'm supposed to wait.
M	PUPKIN	Who was that gentleman? (PUPKIN
M	indicates with a glance to the	entrance to the back offices that
M	RECEPTIONIST	Mr. Gangemi.
M	PUPKIN	Oh, I see. Mr. Gangemi.
M	RECEPTIONIST	He takes care of our air conditioning.
M	CATHY LONG	Uh ... Mr. Pupkin?
M	PUPKIN	Yes?
M	CATHY LONG	I'm Cathy Long.
M	PUPKIN	I'm Mr. Pupkin.
M	CATHY LONG	Can I help you?
M	PUPKIN	I'm sorry, but you are?
M	CATHY LONG	I'm Bert Thomas' assistant.
M	PUPKIN	Bert Thomas?
M	CATHY LONG	He's our executive producer.
M	PUPKIN	Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you see, I've already talked directly with Jerry about my being on the show and he told me to get in touch with him. I'm just here to follow up on that.
M	CATHY LONG	What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?
M	CATHY LONG	Fine. Where are you working?
M	PUPKIN	Well, right now I'm developing new material.
M	CATHY LONG	I see. Well, as soon as you start performing again, let us know where you are and I'll send my assistant down to check you out.
M	PUPKIN	Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary, Miss Long. Jerry and I already went over all this.
M	CATHY LONG	Does Jerry know your work?
M	PUPKIN	Yes. I don't think he does.
M	CATHY LONG	You don't happen to have a tape or a demo that we might listen to?
M	PUPKIN	Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes. That's no problem.
M	CATHY LONG	Good. Why don't you just send one to us and I assure you we'll listen to it promptly.
M	PUPKIN	Great. I'll do that. I can see that'd be a lot easier for Jerry. Thanks a lot, Miss Long.
M	CATHY LONG	Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'd excuse me ...
M	PUPKIN	Sure. Sure. Thanks again.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks.
M	MARSHA	I've got to speak to you for a minute. I'm Marsha.
M	PUPKIN	Yeah. I know.
M	MARSHA	Look. Did Jerry say anything about me last night?
M	PUPKIN	I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ...
M	MARSHA	Was he angry? ... In the car last night, I saw you. Did he talk about me?
M	PUPKIN	I thought that was you. That was some stunt.
M	MARSHA	What did he say?
M	PUPKIN	We didn't talk about you.
M	MARSHA	You know Jerry?
M	PUPKIN	Yeah.
M	MARSHA	Give him this for me.
M	PUPKIN	Why don't you ...
M	MARSHA	Because I can't! Please. I need your help. You'll be my friend forever. Come on. I'll buy you something. What do you want?
M	PUPKIN	I don't want this.
M	MARSHA	Take it. I can get all I want.
M	PUPKIN	Okay. I'll try.
M	MARSHA	Don't try. Do it. Remember. We just made a deal.
M	MARSHA	And don't open it. It's private.
M	PUPKIN	Okay. Okay.
M	MARSHA	How soon can you get it to him?
M	PUPKIN	I don't know. Couple a days.
M	MARSHA	You'd better.
M		gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties and fifties
M	PUPKIN	Testing. Testing. Testing.
M	PUPKIN	First, Miss Long. Thanks very much for your help at the office and for passing this along to Jerry. I appreciate it more than you know.
M	PUPKIN	Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that you've given me. You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling now I know from experience that those people are just cynics, embittered by their own failure. I know, Jerry, that you're as human as the rest of us, if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I guess there's no point going on about it. You know how I feel. So let's get on with the show. The best of Rupert Pupkin! I've sketched out this little introduction in order to save you a little time. So close your eyes and imagine it's exactly six o'clock. You're standing in the wings and we hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike up your theme song.
M	BERT CANTER'S VOICE	And now, direct from New York, it's the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight, with Jerry's special guest ...
M	PUPKIN	... the comedy find of the year making his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the King of Comedy!
M	PUPKIN	Now you come on, Jerry, and do your monologue. Then, when the time comes, this is how I see you introducing me. You'll say something like this. "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to do something a little bit different tonight. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think after you've met my next guest, that you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness. So, now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!"
M	PUPKIN	Will somebody tell that lovely lady that the applause sign is off.
M	PUPKIN	That's a possible introduction, Jerry. Now let's move on to my act.
M	CATHY LONG	Yes?
M	PUPKIN	I didn't want to take any chances with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it here myself.
M	CATHY LONG	We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr. ... ?
M	PUPKIN	Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.
M	CATHY LONG	Well, I certainly appreciate your bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and we'll listen to it as soon as possible.
M	PUPKIN	Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea how soon that might be?
M	CATHY LONG	Well, you can try checking with us tomorrow. We might know something by then. Otherwise, it'll have to be Monday.
M	PUPKIN	What if I just sort of waited around here today, just in case? I'll stay out of the way.
M	CATHY LONG	You'd just be wasting your time, Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest.
M	PUPKIN	Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of
M	CATHY LONG	Look, why don't you try us tomorrow. Okay?
M	PUPKIN	Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Dynamite! This is dynamite!
M	PUPKIN	You think so, Jerry?
M	LANGFORD	Look, I've been at this for fifteen years, Rupert, and I haven't come up with anything like this -- not me, not any of my writers.
M	PUPKIN	Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	How do you do it? I'm not asking to use the material myself. I just want to know how you (LANGFORD waves how you do it.
M	PUPKIN	Well, I don't know if I can explain it, really.
M	LANGFORD	Come on. Try, Rube. about my life, see, mainly about the worst parts, all the awful things, and I just try to see them in a funny light. That's all.
M	LANGFORD	Is that what you do? The worst parts, and then you look at them in a funny light? Is that what you do?
M	PUPKIN	More or less. It's hard to describe how its happens.
M	LANGFORD	But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't happen for me. Why do you think the show is in so much trouble? By the time I've done my monologue, everyone has switched to Carson. Maybe if you did a little writing ... ?
M	PUPKIN	Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could to help out.
M	LANGFORD	You would? Great. Why don't you come out to my place this weekend and we'll hash it out. I'm having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in.
M	PUPKIN	Would you mind if I brought someone?
M	LANGFORD	A girl, Rube?
M	PUPKIN	A very special girl, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	I'd love to meet her.
M	DOORMAN	Cab, Jerry?
M	LANGFORD	That's alright, thanks.
M	DRIVER	Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing and juggle at the same time. How about puttin' him on your show?
M	DRIVER	How about it, Jerry?
M	LANGFORD	Sorry, I'm off duty.
M	WOMAN	You're Jerry!!
M	WOMAN	I undress in front of you every night and Larry here doesn't mind at all.
M	LARRY	I can't get anything started with her until you're off the air. Your show is ruining my sex life, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Well then, you'll just have to put on a better show than I do.
M	MARSHA	Jerry! God damnit!
M	RECEPTIONIST	Yes, sir? (recognizing him) Oh, hi.
M	PUPKIN	Hi. How are you?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Not bad.
M	PUPKIN	I'm fine.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Can I help you?
M	PUPKIN	I'd like to see Jerry, please.
M	RECEPTIONIST	You are ... ?
M	PUPKIN	Mr. Pupkin.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Just a minute.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Mr. Pupkin is here ... That's right ... (to PUPKIN) She'll be with you in a minute.
M	PUPKIN	Who?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Miss Long.
M	PUPKIN	But I wanted to see Jerry.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Mr. Langford's not in. Miss Long will take care of you.
M	PUPKIN	Alright.
M	CATHY LONG	Mr. Pupkin?
M	PUPKIN	How are you today?
M	CATHY LONG	Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for your tape. We listened to it with great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin, we saw a lot of good things in what you're doing. We feel you have good potential. Very good potential.
M	PUPKIN	Thanks.
M	CATHY LONG	That's why I'll be honest with you, Mr. Pupkin ...
M	PUPKIN	Yes?
M	CATHY LONG	We just don't think you're ready yet.
M	PUPKIN	Not ready?
M	CATHY LONG	we just don't feel right now you're right for Jerry.
M	PUPKIN	for Jerry. Sure.
M	CATHY LONG	of the material ... some of the for instance ...
M	PUPKIN	
M	CATHY LONG	were not very strong.
M	PUPKIN	didn't care for some of the jokes, that it?
M	CATHY LONG	right.
M	PUPKIN	Good. I can take care of right way. Thanks. Just tell the ones you think should go. would be a big help. (to the This is great. (to LONG) Which ones?
M	CATHY LONG	it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin. see, Jerry likes to panel his you know, chat with them
M	PUPKIN	Sure.
M	CATHY LONG	frankly, we just don't feel you've very much to talk about right now.
M	PUPKIN	I've got my whole life to talk
M	CATHY LONG	is interesting to you, I'm sure to your wife ... and to a few But we feel that you should developing your act. Test it in live situations. There are a of clubs in the city you can get in touch with us again and we'll be glad to send someone down to check out your progress.
M	PUPKIN	May I ask you a question, Miss Long?
M	CATHY LONG	Of course.
M	PUPKIN	Are you speaking for Jerry?
M	CATHY LONG	Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin. Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment.
M	PUPKIN	I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss Long, and I certainly don't want you to take it personally, but I have to tell you that I don't ... I don't have faith in your judgment.
M	CATHY LONG	Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that.
M	PUPKIN	No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you again.
M	CATHY LONG	That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I have some things to do. I'm sorry the news isn't better.
M	PUPKIN	Miss Long?
M	PUPKIN	When are you expecting Jerry in?
M	CATHY LONG	He won't be in until very late this afternoon.
M	PUPKIN	That's fine. Thank you.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Is there anyone else you would like to see?
M	PUPKIN	That's alright. I'm happy just waiting.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Well, would you mind waiting outside, please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception area, not a waiting room.
M	PUPKIN	I understand.
M	OFFICIAL	Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security for the Langford organization.
M	WIRTZ	Now I think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation.
M	PUPKIN	Sure. Sure.
M	WIRTZ	And that without these rules, we really wouldn't be able to function at our best. You follow my point?
M	WIRTZ	Now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises. And that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin, to cooperate with us.
M	PUPKIN	You want me to leave the building.
M	WIRTZ	That's right. It's nothing personal, Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.
M	WIRTZ	Have a pleasant day.
M	MARSHA	Well, did you give it to him?
M	PUPKIN	Huh?
M	MARSHA	Did you get my letter to him?
M	PUPKIN	He's not in there.
M	MARSHA	Look, if you don't want to give it him, okay. I'll get somebody else. But don't try to con me.
M	PUPKIN	I told you I'd try and I will. I'm going to wait for him right here.
M	MARSHA	Give me the envelope, huh?
M	PUPKIN	Sure, but ...
M	MARSHA	I saw him go in myself!
M	PUPKIN	Who?
M	MARSHA	Jerry!
M	PUPKIN	But they said he wasn't in.
M	MARSHA	Just give me the envelope.
M	PUPKIN	When did he go in?
M	MARSHA	Ten minutes ago! That's when.
M	PUPKIN	You sure?
M	MARSHA	Look, I saw him my ...
M	PUPKIN	And he hasn't come out?
M	MARSHA	I've been standing right here. Now how about it?
M	MARSHA	I'm staying right here!
M	PUPKIN	Tell Jerry Langford I'm here, please.
M	RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in.
M	PUPKIN	I happen to know he is. So would you
M	RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry. He's not in.
M	PUPKIN	You're putting your job on the line, lady.
M	PUPKIN	Jerry! Jerry! (to WIRTZ) You're going the have a hell of a lot of explaining to do! (calling) Jerry!
M	WIRTZ	You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.
M	PUPKIN	Jerry! Help me. Jerry!
M	PUPKIN	Jerry!
M	WIRTZ	If we see your face again, Mr. Pupkin, we'll call the police.
M	PUPKIN	Start looking for a new job!
M	MARSHA	Well?
M	PUPKIN	Huh?
M	MARSHA	Does he have it?
M	PUPKIN	Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
M	MARSHA	Yeah? When?
M	PUPKIN	This weekend. He asked me to go out there, to his house.
F	RITA	What are we going to do?
M	PUPKIN	Look, I told you, I've got some work to discuss with him. That's all.
F	RITA	But what about me?
M	PUPKIN	You're with me.
F	RITA	That's fine, but while you two are talking, what am I going to do?
M	PUPKIN	You can chat with the other guests.
F	RITA	I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer. (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model, okay?
M	PUPKIN	What?
F	RITA	If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you?
M	PUPKIN	If it make you feel better.
F	RITA	This is a gas! Too bad nobody'll believe it. (pause) After you guys are done working, what happens? Are we going out someplace, or what?
M	PUPKIN	I'm sure Jerry has something arranged.
F	RITA	What do these people do for fun? Do they party or do freaky things or just get drunk or ... I mean, What do they do?
M	PUPKIN	I guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each other's company, like anybody else.
F	RITA	Talk?!? What can you talk about for three or four hours?!
M	PUPKIN	What do you mean? They've got plenty to talk about. They do things. All kinds of interesting things happen to them and then they talk about them. What do you think Jerry's show is all about?
F	RITA	Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That's what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep.
F	RITA	Boy, this is going to be some great weekend. I thought we were gonna have some fun.
M	PUPKIN	Just take it easy, Rita. Everything's going to be fine.
M	PUPKIN	Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York. Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And once you're on the list, you're in real trouble, like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work. (a little
M	PUPKIN	Thanks.
M	PUPKIN	So what my friend does is get himself a dog, one of those huge German Shepherds. One night, he's walking the dog in Central Park when he hears this voice behind him. (in a German accent) Okay, Harry, drop your vallet and keep your hantz over your head or I bite your little fanny off.
M	ONE GUEST	Looks like you've found yourself a winner, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	He's the one who found himself a winner.
M	A SECOND GUEST	Have you set a date?
M	PUPKIN	Oh, yes.
M	A THIRD GUEST	I hope we're all invited.
M	PUPKIN	Everyone's invited.
M	OFFICIAL	We are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock. But, before we begin, let me voice a personal word of thanks to you, Rupert and to you, Rita, for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony. Because we are on prime time, I am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections. When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow students, I underestimated this fine young man. Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System. But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were career and a lifetime of happiness, I voluntarily stepped down. I would only here add my own wishes to those of millions of viewers for their continued health, wealth and boundless success.
M	OFFICIAL	We'll be back to marry them in a minute, right after this word.
M	CONDUCTOR'S VOICE	Greenwich. Greenwich next stop. Greenwich.
F	RITA	Look at that one. How'd you like to live in that?!?! Or that one! What do you figure these run?
M	PUPKIN	What's this?
M	DRIVER	This is it.
F	RITA	It's gorgeous!
M	PUPKIN	You sure?
M	DRIVER	Look, friend, I wouldn't want to tell you how many times I made this trip. (pause) That'll be three seventy-five.
M	PUPKIN	Keep it.
M	DRIVER	Thanks. If you need a ride back, just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me.
M	PUPKIN	You must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's expecting us.
M	JONNO	Mr. Langford asked you to come?
M	PUPKIN	That's right. Would you mind taking those up? Jerry and I have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight.
M	JONNO	But Mr. Langford's not here.
M	PUPKIN	Out playing golf, right?
M	JONNO	That's right.
M	PUPKIN	Maybe he'll finally break a hundred.
M	JONNO	Maybe it's better if you came back ...
M	PUPKIN	That's alright. We don't mind waiting.
F	RITA	The table's only set for one.
M	PUPKIN	That's from breakfast. Relax, will you?
M	JONNO	Let me talk to Jerry Langford please ... I know he is ... It's important.
M	PUPKIN	How do you like it?
F	RITA	I could live here.
M	PUPKIN	It's the only way to live.
F	RITA	How come he isn't here?
M	PUPKIN	You heard the guy. He's out playing golf.
F	RITA	Didn't you tell him when we'd get here?
M	PUPKIN	We didn't have time to iron out the details. Now just relax. We're the first guests, that's all.
F	RITA	That Jonno character hadn't even heard of us!
M	PUPKIN	It probably slipped Jerry's mind. He has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy.
F	RITA	It's just not time way I expected it, that's all.
F	RITA	What do we do now?
M	PUPKIN	These are Jerry's parents. His father runs the Post office in Wolverine -- that's in North Dakota.
M	PUPKIN	This one was in Newsweek. He started giving these puppet shows when he was still in grade school.
M	PUPKIN	And this is from his quiz show in St. Louis. Can you believe it?
F	RITA	Sure I can.
M	PUPKIN	That was the name of the show.
M	PUPKIN	And here's when he wrote for Jack Paar. He made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now.
M	PUPKIN	And this is his morning show.
M	PUPKIN	And his kids. He's divorced.
F	RITA	Look at this. I love these kind of things. Look at the work. I've got this thing about boxes.
M	JONNO	Mr. Langford? ... I'm sorry to disturb you ...
F	RITA	How much longer are we gonna have to wait?
M	PUPKIN	I don't know. Until he gets back.
M	RITA.	Do we have to just sit here?
M	PUPKIN	He should be back pretty soon.
F	RITA	Doesn't he have any music or anything? Let's get a little life into this place. It's like a funeral parlor.
F	RITA	This is more like it.
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Rita.
F	RITA	Come on, yourself.
F	RITA	How about a little spin, handsome? Here?
F	RITA	Come on, Rupert. I came up here for a good time.
M	SINATRA'S VOICE	The way you wore your hat, The way we danced till three, The memory of all that -- Oh no, they can't take that away from me, No ... they can't take that away ... from ... me.
F	RITA	You never could dance, could you?
M	PUPKIN	How would you know?
F	RITA	Oh I danced with you a couple of times -- at the Sigma U party.
M	PUPKIN	You were there with Tommy Winston.
F	RITA	You didn't ask me.
M	PUPKIN	That's the one time I did ask you and you went with him anyway.
F	RITA	Well, I couldn't go with you!
M	PUPKIN	Why not?
F	RITA	Be serious, Rupert.
M	PUPKIN	Well, it's all ended happily and that's what counts.
F	RITA	I wonder what the rest of this place looks like?
M	PUPKIN	I'm sure it's all very nice.
F	RITA	Well, there's only one way to find out.
F	RITA	You coming or not?
M	PUPKIN	Rita!
M	PUPKIN	Where are you?
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Rita. This isn't funny.
M	PUPKIN	What are you doing, Rita?
F	RITA	I love it! All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now.
M	PUPKIN	Come on. We shouldn't be here.
F	RITA	Relax, will you. Let me have a little fun, for Christ's sake.
F	RITA	Look at this. It's nicer than my whole apartment.
M	PUPKIN	Let's go, Rita.
F	RITA	Boy, I really need some sun.
M	PUPKIN	Rita, this is Jerry's ...
F	RITA	Lay off, will you, Rupert.
M	PUPKIN	But we have no right ...
M	PUPKIN	That wasn't funny, Rita.
F	RITA	Here.
F	RITA	Now for something that smells nice.
M	LANGFORD	Where are they?
M	JONNO	I was going to call the police but then I thought to myself 'what if they are Mr. Langford's friends?'
M	PUPKIN	Hi, Jerry. We were just freshening up.
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.
M	PUPKIN	Jerry, I'd like you to meet Rita Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!
F	RITA	Pleased to meet you.
M	PUPKIN	What's your pleasure?
M	PUPKIN	We've already taken the liberty, so to speak. Rita was a little nervous. It isn't every day she meets someone like you.
M	LANGFORD	What's going on here?
M	PUPKIN	We've been sitting around, waiting. That's all. How was your golf game?
M	JONNO	I told them you weren't here.
M	COOK	That's right.
M	PUPKIN	He did, Jerry. He was very helpful. We had to take an early train. There was nothing else until after one. (pause) I brought the material. It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause) Where is everybody?
M	LANGFORD	Who?
M	PUPKIN	The other guests! (in a confidential tone) We're getting a little hungry, to tell you the truth.
M	LANGFORD	You are.
M	PUPKIN	But we don't mind waiting, do we, Rita?
M	LANGFORD	You know, I could have you arrested, both of you.
M	PUPKIN	You know you could! And there'd be absolutely no way we could prove we belonged here. I never thought of that.
M	LANGFORD	Well, you should have before you ...
M	PUPKIN	Maybe we could work up a routine about that, about a guy who throws all his friends in jail. Let's talk about that.
M	LANGFORD	Let's not.
M	PUPKIN	Sure, Jerry. Whatever you ...
M	LANGFORD	Look, if you've got something for me to sign, let's have it and get it over with so I can get back ...
M	PUPKIN	That wouldn't be right, Jerry. Not in your own house!
M	LANGFORD	I have a lot of work to get to. (to JONNO) How did they get here?
M	PUPKIN	We took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't worry about us. You go ahead and do your work and we'll just take a stroll around until lunch is ready.
M	LANGFORD	You're a little thick, aren't you?
M	PUPKIN	Well, maybe a ...
F	RITA	What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he wants us out.
M	PUPKIN	Don't listen to her, Jerry. She doesn't understand anything about us.
F	RITA	Don't get me into this.
M	LANGFORD	Call the station.
M	LANGFORD	There'll be a cab here in a few minutes. Now if you'll just wait at the gate ...
M	PUPKIN	Look, Jerry, if I've said anything out of line, let's chalk it up to inexperience, okay? I'll just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working. It shouldn't take long and then you'll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself.
M	LANGFORD	I've told you just as clearly as I can. I want you out of here and I want you out now. Scram, beat it, vamoose, out! Is that plain enough!
M	PUPKIN	are we going to go over it?
F	RITA	Come on, Rupert, the man wants us to go.
M	PUPKIN	Tell her she's wrong, Jerry!
F	RITA	Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know anything about all this. I hardly know this guy. I haven't seen him in years.
M	PUPKIN	Rita!
F	RITA	So if there's anything I can do, any way I can make this up to you.
M	PUPKIN	She's nothing, Jerry. She's just some girl who works in a bar. Don't let her spoil things.
M	LANGFORD	Come on. Let's go.
M	PUPKIN	All I'm asking is fifteen minutes. That's all. Just long enough to listen to my act. Is that asking too much -- fifteen minutes of your day against my whole life?
M	LANGFORD	I'll call the police if I have to.
M	LANGFORD	I have my own life, that's all.
M	PUPKIN	But what about me, Jerry? What about my life? I made plans -- based on what you said. You can't just turn your back on me.
M	LANGFORD	I'm not telling you again.
M	PUPKIN	So this is the way it works when you're big, huh? You just play with people. Is that part of the kick, Jerry? (pause) I can see I was all wrong about you. All wrong.
F	RITA	Come on, Rupert.
M	PUPKIN	Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't my friend at all, were you? You were just playing some kind of game with me. Well, that's not going to stop me, Jerry. I'm just going to work a little bit harder, that's all, use a little bit more enterprise. And not count on anybody. That's where I made my mistake. I can see that now.
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time.
F	RITA	What did you think was going to happen? You think he'd just ... ? What's the matter with you? (pause) You can't just walk into a guy's house! And what about me? What did you ...
M	PUPKIN	Shut up, Rita. I'm thinking.
M	MARSHA	How much longer?!?
M	PUPKIN	Do you want him or not?
M	MARSHA	You sure he's in there?
M	PUPKIN	Certain.
M	MARSHA	My parents are going to be furious!
M	MARSHA	It looks real.
M	PUPKIN	That's the whole point. (gesturing with his head towards the entrance of the building which is some 50 yards away) Pay attention.
M	MARSHA	What if he doesn't come down?
M	PUPKIN	He will.
M	MARSHA	But what if he doesn't?
M	PUPKIN	We'll come back tomorrow.
M	MARSHA	And wait again?
M	PUPKIN	Look, you're going to have him all to yourself. What else do you want?
M	MARSHA	No.
M	PUPKIN	You sure?
M	MARSHA	Sure I'm sure. That looks too much like him.
M	PUPKIN	What do you mean?
M	MARSHA	When it's him it doesn't look like him.
M	PUPKIN	Keep watching.
M	MARSHA	That's him.
M	MARSHA	What should I do?
M	PUPKIN	Wait a second and follow him.
M	MARSHA	What about here?
M	PUPKIN	Too busy. Keep going.
M	PUPKIN	Go past him and stop.
M	PUPKIN	Just keep walking or I'll kill you right here.
M	PUPKIN	I said keep walking. This is a gun in my pocket and I've got nothing to lose.
M	LANGFORD	What do you want?
M	PUPKIN	Just keep walking and don't talk to anybody. I'll tell you what to do.
M	PUPKIN	Get in!
M	LANGFORD	
M	PUPKIN	Just shut up and get in.
M	MARSHA	Hi, Jerry.
M	PUPKIN	I didn't like being so rough out there, Jerry. But I wanted you to know that I meant business. I didn't want anything happening to you over some misunderstanding.
M	PUPKIN	Now I know you're wondering what this is all about. Actually you've got nothing to worry about. You just do what I tell you and by, say, midnight, you'll be safe and out of here. Of course if you try anything clever, I'll kill you -- or Marsha will. She knows how to use this too.
M	LANGFORD	You realize what you're saying.
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Jerry. This isn't a spur credit, will you.
M	PUPKIN	Sit down.
M	PUPKIN	Now, you're going to call your office and tell them this: that unless a man who identifies himself as the King is allowed on the show tonight as the first guest, they'll never see you alive again.
M	LANGFORD	What?
M	PUPKIN	I'll say it again ...
M	THOMAS' SECRETARY	Bert Thomas! ... He's in a meeting, Mr. Langford ... I see.
M	SECRETARY	He says it's urgent.
M	THOMAS	Yeah? Well, tell him I'll call him back. (to the others) It's that Martino kid, the impressionist.
M	PUPKIN	Then try again!
M	THOMAS	Yeah? ... Okay, Martino, let's stop the bullshit ... what? ... Okay, I'm listening.
M	THOMAS	Give me that again? ... Wait a minute. What do we call our second cameraman?
M	LANGFORD	Helen Keller.
M	PUPKIN	No tricks, Jerry.
M	THOMAS	Don't do anything, Jerry. Stay right there. Tell him we'll do anything he wants. Tell him to cool it. Are you okay? ... Look, tell him to call us about five, okay. We'll let him know what to do. And don't do anything stupid.
M	THOMAS	Vivien!
M	THOMAS	Get me the number of the F.B.I. right away. And get me Crockett's office. And keep your mouth shut about this.
M	MARSHA	What do you think?
M	PUPKIN	Looks fine.
M	MARSHA	I had to guess on the sleeves. doesn't he?
M	PUPKIN	Sure, if he isn't dead.
M	THOMAS	I know he's in a meeting and I don't care. I've got to talk to him! ... No, he can not call me back. Don't you understand? This is an emergency ... NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
M	PUPKIN	This wasn't an easy decision for me, Jerry, believe me. For one thing, I knew it meant we could never be friends again and that hurt me. It's hard to lose a friend, even one who has let you down. You always hope you can patch things up. You know, a guy like me doesn't make friends that easily.
M	PUPKIN	Why didn't you just listen to the tape when I asked you? Then I wouldn't have to be doing all this. Was it really too much to expect -- a few minutes of your time to listen to something I'd worked on my whole life?
M	LANGFORD	Hey, if that's what's bothering you, let's go over to my office and listen to that tape right now.
M	PUPKIN	Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know what would happen to me?
M	MARSHA	Am I going to have to hold this thing all day?
M	PUPKIN	You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two- way street. All that time I was worrying about you and your ratings and everything, you couldn't have cared less about me.
M	LANGFORD	You're right. You know that? I was thoughtless. It's just that when you're doing a big show, it's hard to tell who your friends really are. I was wrong. I apologize. Why don't we just shake hands and forget the whole thing?
M	PUPKIN	That's easy to say, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	But I mean it. I'll tell them that the whole thing was a joke and then we can go to my office and listen to that tape. Come on. What do you say?
M	MARSHA	Sit down!
M	MARSHA	I said sit!
M	PUPKIN	What's the matter? You heard what he said.
M	MARSHA	All of a sudden, with a gun on him, he wants to make up and be friends. And, once he's out the door, what happens then?
M	PUPKIN	What happens then, Jerry?
M	MARSHA	You get to his office and they jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.
M	PUPKIN	She's right, Jerry.
M	LANGFORD	Not if I tell them not to. This is Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.
M	PUPKIN	He gives me his word.
M	MARSHA	Yeah? And what else? Come on, Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.
M	PUPKIN	And what else, Jerry?
M	LANGFORD	Come on, Rupert. My word's good enough, isn't it.
M	PUPKIN	Keep the gun up!
M	PUPKIN	I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry, but I'm no good at knots. Just put your arms up and out, okay?
M	PUPKIN	Oh, no, Jerry. None of that. Now hold still.
M	PATTEN	Look, I tell you, the bureau is doing everything possible to locate Mr. Langford. Right now our men are out checking out every radical group in this city.
M	AN EXECUTIVE	Radical?
M	PATTEN	They're willing to sacrifice their leader in order to get their message across, aren't they? You've got to figure that this is a desperate outfit. I don't know who they are anymore than you do. But I do know I've got to stop them. Otherwise, what you're seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings.
M	THOMAS	Does this mean we're not supposed to put him on?!?
M	PATTEN	Who am I addressing, please?
F	CROCKETT	That's Bert Thomas. He produces the show.
M	PATTEN	I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we can't allow this to reach the public. When the kidnappers call in, of course you're going to be cooperative. Promise them anything they want. After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later. And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford is.
M	PATTEN	Sure. Let him go on if you have to. It's just a taping. You can always erase him afterwards, can't you? (pause) All I'm saying is this: don't put him on the air.
M	THOMAS	That's fine, Inspector, but let's say he finishes his bit and you've worked him over ...
M	PATTEN	Questioned him, Mr. Thomas.
M	THOMAS	Okay, questioned him and he still won't talk. We get to eleven thirty and what do we do? Do we air him or what?
M	PATTEN	I would say no.
M	THOMAS	But they might kill Jerry!
F	CROCKETT	Okay, Burt. (to PATTEN) Thank you, Inspector. We appreciate your position and we'll do all we can to cooperate with you. But I have to tell you right now that, if it comes down to it, we're not taking any chances with Mr. Langford's life.
M	PATTEN	I understand but ...
F	CROCKETT	If your men haven't been able to locate Mr. Langford by air time, we're going to have to put this King guy on, no matter what he's said. After all, Inspector, what's ten or fifteen minutes of talk show time against a man's life?
M	PUPKIN	Open. (pause) Bite ... Good.
M	PUPKIN	Can you breathe? Both ways? In and out?
M	PUPKIN	You've got until around midnight. Have a good time. (to LANGFORD) So long, Jerry! Wish me luck.
M	THOMAS' SECRETARY	Bert Thomas! Who's calling please? (her voice grows tense) Yes, Mr. King.
M	PATTEN	Keep him talking.
M	THOMAS	Yes? ... Yes, Mr, King. We understand. Everything's been arranged. Now if you'll just tell me a little about the nature of your material, so that we can ...
M	PUPKIN	I'll tell you everything you need to know at the studio this evening, Mr. Thomas. I appreciate your co- operation. Goodbye.
M	MARSHA	I've got so much to tell you I just don't know what to begin with. Are you okay?
M	MARSHA	Good. Tell me if you're not. I guess you're wondering why I do stuff like this. I think it's because I'm a Leo, but my shrink says I'm pathologically rebellious and self-destructive. You don't think I'm self-destructive, do you?
M	MARSHA	I knew you wouldn't. That's 'cause you're the only person in the world who really understands me.
F	CROCKETT	Can Randall* sub for Jerry?
M	THOMAS	His agent's calling us back but it looks good. I only told him Jerry's sick.
F	CROCKETT	Well, if worse comes to worse, Canter can always carry it. (to CATHY LONG) Let me see your list.
F	CROCKETT	Any one of these a writer?
M	THOMAS	McCabe. The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.
F	CROCKETT	He's out.
M	CATHY LONG	What if we don't run this King guy? Who'll fill the time?
F	CROCKETT	We'll stretch the other guests. But I think we're going to wind up running him. For one thing, we've got to think about Jerry.
M	FIRST EXECUTIVE	And from a news point of view, we've got a responsibility to air this story.
F	CROCKETT	Exactly, Lou. (pause) I mean, who would you rather watch -- some tiger expert or a live kidnapper.
M	A SECOND EXECUTIVE	But nobody's going to know he's a kidnapper. They'll think we've gone crazy.
F	CROCKETT	Then they'll read about it in the papers tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night, everyone in America will be watching he can put this King guy on rerun.
M	THOMAS	You're going to put him on twice?
M	A THIRD EXECUTIVE	What if his stuff's unusable?
M	SECOND EXECUTIVE	And remember what Patten said about ...
F	CROCKETT	Hold on. (pause) We can always edit the guy. And, as for a wave of these things, I just don't buy the idea that there are that many people out there crazy enough to spend their lives in prison for a few minutes on television.
M	MCCABE	Good evening, officer. This is the backstage door I take it?
M	GUARD	Your name please?
M	MCCABE	Clarence McCabe, the writer. And this is Mrs. McCabe and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of Cleveland.
M	GUARD	I'm sorry, sir. I don't see you here.
M	MCCABE	I'm on the show tonight, officer.
M	GUARD	Well, you're not here.
M	MCCABE	Look, Cathy Long gave me instructions to present myself at a quarter to six. May I see her please?
M	GUARD	I'm under strictest orders tonight to admit only authorized personnel.
M	MCCABE	Wait right here.
M	GUARD	Stop him!
M	MCCABE	Hey!
M	PATTEN	Are you the King?
M	PUPKIN	Excuse me.
M	PUPKIN	I'm the King.
M	CAMERAMAN	Yeah?
M	PATTEN	Don't talk to me about tigers!
M	PUPKIN	I'm the King.
M	STAGE MANAGER	What can I do for you, your highness?
M	CATHY LONG	What are you doing here, Mr. Pupkin?!?!
M	MARSHA	"I'm gonna love you, Like no one's ever loved you, Come rain or come shine, Happy together, unhappy together, And won't it be fine."
M	PATTEN	I hope you brought me the right guy this time. (to PUPKIN) Where's Jerry Langford?
M	PUPKIN	Are you on the show?
M	PATTEN	No, Mr. King. That's my assistant, Mr. Giardello.
M	PUPKIN	I want to see someone on the show.
M	PATTEN	Well, you tell us where Mr. Langford is and we'll let you see anyone you want.
M	PUPKIN	Just get me someone from the show.
M	PATTEN	Come on, Mr. King. Let's not fool Should we know about any of these people?
M	PUPKIN	That's Orson Bean.
M	PATTEN	I see. (to GIARDELLO) Check these out.
M	PATTEN	Now are you going to talk to us, or not?
M	PUPKIN	Sure I'll talk. Just get me someone from the show.
M	PATTEN	Get that Thomas guy in here.
M	PATTEN	We haven't much time, Mr. King.
M	PATTEN	Let's start with your name.
M	PUPKIN	Rupert Pupkin.
M	PATTEN	That's your real name?
M	PUPKIN	Yes sir.
M	PATTEN	You an American?
M	PUPKIN	Yes.
M	PATTEN	Then why do you people do these things?
M	PUPKIN	Are you on the show?
M	THOMAS	Yes. I'm Bert Thomas.
M	PUPKIN	Here's the introduction to my act. Please make sure Mr. Randall follows it exactly as I've written it.
M	PATTEN	Okay. How about helping us, Mr. King?
M	PUPKIN	What about make-up? I need make-up.
M	PATTEN	Put some color in his cheeks.
M	MARSHA	It was the second lead! I'd never gotten a part in my life and here I get the second lead. And what does Daddy say?
M	MARSHA	Not "Marsha, that's wonderful" or "we're proud of you" or anything. Oh no. He starts lecturing me on how I should have tried out for Emily! Now do you understand, Jerry!
M	MARSHA	My doctor says I shouldn't get excited.
M	MARSHA	This is the best I ever made it. You want some?
M	MARSHA	Now open. Marsha's going to feed her Jerry.
M	PATTEN	How about it, King?
M	PUPKIN	If I'm not on that show, Jerry Langford is dead, I promise you.
M	TECHNICIAN	Hold on two. Hold. Hold. Come on, Keller. Get it framed!
M	CANTER	Now! Direct from New York! It's the Jerry Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests -- Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor and another of Jerry's taped exclusives, an interview with Prince Ranier of Monaco. As always, Rick Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert Canter. And now ... say hello to Tony!!!!!!
M	RANDALL	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have some sad news for you. Earlier today, my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening.
M	RANDALL	No embarrassing displays of emotion, please. (the AUDIENCE laughs) Instead, we're going to do something a little bit different this evening -- a lot different if you ask me. We're going to give you a glimpse into the future. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think tonight, after you've met my first guest, you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness -- in one way or another. So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!!
M	TECHNICIAN	Just hold. Three. Pick up the audience.
M	PUPKIN	Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense. (laughter) Is there anyone here from Clifton? (silence) Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective. But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?" (laughter) You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic. (laughter) We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded. (laughter) Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage. (laughter) When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd
M	throw up. (laughter) And who would	clean it up? Not Dad. He was too busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on his own. In fact, until I was sixteen, I thought throwing up was a sign of maturity. While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat. (laughter) I never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me. Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck, I managed to heave all over his new shoes. "That's it," I thought. "I've made it. I'm finally a man!" (laughter) As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me. He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose. And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man. (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially interested in athletics. The only exercise I ever got was when the other kids picked on me. They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday. After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum. And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit. (laughter) Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me. I kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you? Don't you want graduate?" As for me, I was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction. The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling. But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business. Even as a young man, I began at the very top, collecting autographs. (laughter)
M	LANGFORD	That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha. I want you to know how much I enjoyed it.
M	MARSHA	We can do it again.
M	LANGFORD	I'd like to show you my gratitude. But it's a little difficult, like this.
M	MARSHA.	Let's say I took all this off. What would you do to me? Tell me.
M	PUPKIN	A lot of you are probably wondering why Jerry couldn't make it this evening. Well, he's tied up -- and I'm the one who tied him. (laughter) You think I'm joking, but that's the only way I could break into show business -- by hijacking Jerry Langford. (laughter) I'm not kidding. Right now, Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city. the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll think I was crazy. But I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good night ladies and gentlemen. God bless you.
M	MAE	Who did you get?
M	MAE	Could I have a ride?
M	MAE	I've never been in one.
M	PATTEN	Okay, Pupkin. We'll start all over again. Where is Langford? You know, we're going to find him sooner or later.
M	PUPKIN	I'm trying to tell you, Inspector. You let me walk out of here, right? And as soon as I'm seen my act on the show -- as soon as I'm sure they've really put it on -- I'll tell you where Jerry is and you'll get him back safe and sound.
M	PATTEN	Fine, Pupkin. Then why don't you watch the show here with us? That way we're all happy. (to GIARDELLO) What channel?
M	GIARDELLO	Seven.
M	PATTEN	We get that one in fine. So what do you say, Pupkin?
M	PUPKIN	Look, I'll say it again. You let me go now.
M	LANGFORD	Watch my hair!
M	MARSHA	I'm sorry, baby.
M	LANGFORD	Ow!
M	MARSHA	I'm sorry.
M	A PLAINCLOTHESMAN	Still nothing.
M	PUPKIN	I've got to get out of here.
M	PATTEN	You're not going anywhere, Pupkin. Now, where is he?
M	PUPKIN	I'm telling you, Inspector, if I don't see that show where I want to see it, Jerry Langford is dead. My people have instructions to execute him unless they hear from me by midnight.
M	PATTEN	Just where is it you want to watch this show?
M	LANGFORD	Ow! God damnit! Not so fast!
M	MARSHA	We haven't all night, baby.
M	LANGFORD	OW!!!!
M	MARSHA	Oh, I love you, baby. I love you so much.
M	PATTEN	Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know what this is all about, but as soon as you've seen yourself, you're going to talk to us or I promise you, you'll never see daylight again.
M	PUPKIN	I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector.
M	PUPKIN	After it's over, I want a couple of minutes. And I'll need ten dollars. Does anyone of you gentlemen have my wallet?
M	PATTEN	Don't push me, Pupkin.
M	PUPKIN	A condemned man's last request, Inspector.
M	PATTEN	Well, I'll tell you right away, the answer is no, Pupkin.
M	PUPKIN	It's not much of a ransom, Inspector ...
M	PATTEN	Look, I'm drawing the line, that's all! No ten dollars and that's it. (emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!! You understand?!?
M	PUPKIN	Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ...
M	PATTEN	Okay.
M	PUPKIN	... and no Jerry Langford.
M	PUPKIN	Come on, it's getting late, Inspector.
M	PATTEN	Go ahead. Give him his goddamned ten dollars! Give him twenty! I don't care. Just get him out of here!
M	PUPKIN	Turn on Langford. Seven.
M	MOUSY MAN	Hey! I'm watching this.
M	PUPKIN	Just turn it. Come on.
M	MOUSY MAN	I was here first, mister. You can't just walk in like this. It isn't fair.
M	MARSHA	Oh, baby. Baby.
M	LANGFORD	Stop!
M	MARSHA	Ow!
M	MARSHA	Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby. But I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime. (audience and CUSTOMERS laugh) Good night, ladies and gentlemen, and God bless you.
M	HALF-STEWED MAN FIRST FRIEND	Hey, that's pretty good. (to PUPKIN) he's talkin' about? brother! SECOND FRIEND HALF-STEWED WOMAN It's a trick, that's about your all. Larry can do it as good as him.
M	HALF-STEWED MAN MOUSY MAN	about him? Is it over now?
M	HALF-STEWED WOMAN FIRST FRIEND	another one. He's funnier than Larry. Larry just makes a lot HALF-STEWED MAN of faces. told you to shut up about MOUSY MAN brother. (to PUPKIN) Well, if nobody doesn't know nuthin'. minds ...
M	PUPKIN	Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party. (to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around on me.
M	HALF-STEWED MAN	What about the hundred and fifty? We never saw a penny outta your brother.
M	HALF-STEWED WOMAN	That's because my brother is a family man, not like Phil.
M	PUPKIN	What'll you have?
M	FIRST FRIEND	I'm okay. Thanks, pal.
M	SECOND FRIEND	Me, too.
M	PUPKIN	I don't suppose you're allowed anything. (to RITA) I guess nobody's in a celebrating mood. How about you? You want something?
M	FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN	It's getting time, Pupkin.
M	PUPKIN	In a second.
F	RITA	That was true, wasn't it? ... about the kidnapping.
M	PUPKIN	Now you can say you knew me. That's something, anyway.
M	FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN	Come on, Pupkin.
M	PUPKIN	I guess I've got go. Take care of yourself, will you. And when you're bored -- you know, when you're brushing your teeth or something, give me a thought, okay?
F	RITA	Okay.
M	HALF-STEWED WOMAN	It's okay to talk about my sister, but we can't say nuthin' about Phil, is that it?
M	HALF-STEWED MAN	She's just had one too many.
M	FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN	I just don't get it, Pupkin. You're gonna spend eight years in the can -- "minimum" -- and for what?
M	SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN	Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.
