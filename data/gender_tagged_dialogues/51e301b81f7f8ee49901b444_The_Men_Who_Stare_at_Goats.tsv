M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	LIEUTENANT BOONE	Yes General?
M	GENERAL PUTKIN	I'm going into the next office.
M	LIEUTENANT BOONE	Yes sir. He stares up at the wall balefully.
M	GENERAL PUTKIN	Damn it! I have been having ideas, gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And when I thought about these ideas I thought about who in the U.S Army would be most receptive to my challenging ideas. Which section of the military is always straining to reach the peak of their physical and mental capabilities?
M	GENERAL PUTKIN	You are, gentlemen. Special Forces. The assembled Officers nod modestly.
M	GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)	I want to talk to you about Mind Wars, gentlemen. War...With... His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a
M	GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)	How'd you like to be able to do this? What if you could teach soldiers to do this? Would you be interested? Silence. Or, or let's say you have a unit operating outside the protection of mainline units. What happens if someone gets hurt? How do you deal with that? He surveys the blank faces.
M	GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)	Psychic healing! Protect the unit with hands-off healing. Using the mind to heal. Silence. Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience.
M	GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)	Let's talk about time! What if time is not a point but a space and at any one instant we can be anywhere in that space! (Laughing) Physicists go nuts when I say that! Silence. He is growing desperate.
M	GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)	Animals! Stopping the hearts of animals! This is the idea I'm coming to you with. You have access to animals right? Special Forces look like they've had enough. A tough
M	MAJOR HOLTZ	No sir. We don't have access to animals. In 1983, when Special Forces told General Putkin that they weren't interested in his ideas...that was a lie. And when they told him they didn't have access to animals...that was also a lie. We FOCUS on the window - a shaky ZOOM taking us towards
M	BOB (V.O.)	The hundred goats in the disused hospital building had been secretly flown in from Central America so as to avoid customs. Special Forces weren't worried about the General hearing the goats because they'd been de- bleated. The GOATS stare at us, their mouths silently opening and
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	This is the story of those goats. We CLOSE ON the unblinking EYES of one GOAT, then...
M	BOB (V.O.)	My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me back in Michigan, where I was born and raised. I studied journalism at Western in Kalamazoo and then I got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories about competitive food eating contests. He looks at the photograph of his wife Debora on his desk Look at me. So young. "The past is a different country. They...do things there." We PAN to the next desk and Bob's over-weight colleague
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	This is Ron. Ron suddenly pitches violently forward, thudding face-
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He's the man who died. My wife, Debora, told me later that Ron's death had been like a wake-up call for her - what people used to call a memento mori. Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	That massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness. Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's, Bob frowns.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	A week after the funeral she left me for my editor. It seemed like such a tragedy at the time. We couldn't see beyond our little lives to the great events of history unfolding out there in the world.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I was like a child. Or a Hobbit, safe in the Shire.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Or a blonde farm boy on a distant, desert planet, unaware that he was already taking the first steps on the path that will lead him inexorably towards the heart of a conflict between the forces of Good and Evil.
M	PRESIDENT BUSH	Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves... Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Had I known where that path would lead, had a soft wind from my future brought me the name of Bill Django, I might never have gone. But as it was, I did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart... I went to war. We hear the opening of a period song as we...
M	11 TITLES 11	As the titles and song continue we see U.S TV footage ""Shock and Awe" air attack on Baghdad Caravans of U.S troops snaking through the desert destroyed on the ground Oil Wells ablaze PFC Jessica Lynch being rescued by Special Forces. Apache Helicopter attacks and destroys an Iraqi tank.
M	DETERMINATION	American troops pull down a huge statue of Saddam Hussein
M	BOB	Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't lie to you Debora - it's been pretty damn hairy.
M	DEBORA (O.S.)	Yeah. We've been watching it on Fox. Yeah, it's not, uh... I've seen things that you shouldn't, you know... He shakes his head sadly.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Pretty damn hairy. Well I don't even know why you're there. You're not exactly war correspondent material are you? Well, I think it's important people get an accurate picture of what's... What? Yeah. ...what's, uh, happening, so...is that Dave?
M	DEBORA (O.S.)	Yeah. He says Hi. Bob stares out of the window, nodding, afraid he might
M	BOB	Oh, that's, that's... He BEATS his head off the wall for a moment.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out - heading up north to cover the fighting there... You missed the war?
M	BOB	Yeah. They laugh.
M	SECOND JOURNALIST	How? I've been stuck here. They've only just given me the green-light. So I'll probably head over there soon. I'm just working on this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build. The Journalists look bored. Yeah, I think they didn't want me going over because I'm not embedded.
M	SECOND JOURNALIST	Yeah, they don't like the unilats. The troops think the unilats'll stab `em in the back. When you're
M	EMBEDDED	you form a bond with the soldiers. You're like one of them.
M	FIRST JOURNALIST	You see action?
M	SECOND JOURNALIST	Went into Baghdad with Charlie Company, Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division...
M	FIRST JOURNALIST	The thunder run? Heard you had it pretty bad.
M	SECOND JOURNALIST	Could say that. Technicals all the way, RPG's, fuckers were firing anti-aircraft guns at us...
M	FIRST JOURNALIST	You know a Private First Class Zuchero?
M	SECOND MAN	Zook? I was standing next to him when he took a hit... Bob sits ignored, feeling inadequate as they continue to
M	BOB	So what's a useful phrase?
M	KUWAIT WAITER	La termi, ana sahafi. Bob repeats this.
M	BOB	What's that mean?
M	KUWAIT WAITER	Don't shoot, I'm a reporter. He walks off. Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his Hey.
M	MAN	Hey. Bob reads the logo on the baseball cap.
M	BOB	DeWitt Resources. Arkansas. Right. We make trash cans.
M	BOB	You over here for the conference? Looking for a contract right?
M	MAN	I guess.
M	BOB	What's your pitch? The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face
M	MAN	Well...we're real cheap. Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand.
M	BOB	Bob Wilton. Skip.
M	BOB	Could I bum a smoke, Skip? Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I sat there watching those reporters and realized I didn't want to be me anymore. I wanted to be them. I wanted to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations. Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Everyone gets everything he wants. Like the man said. I wanted a mission. Oh crap, can't find my... A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the And for my sins, Fate brought me one. He stares at the name as he puffs on the cigarette, Lyn Cassady...? This is the home learning course we're putting out, which is very popular.
M	GUS LACEY	Then there's the seminars. When I'm not teaching I spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing.
M	BOB	Right here?
M	GUS LACEY	The kitchen table. That is correct. That's where my body is. But my mind...that's, you know... He gestures to the horizon.
M	BOB	Wandering?
M	GUS LACEY	Wandering. Roaming. Yeah.
M	BOB	So what have you seen lately?
M	GUS LACEY	Lately I've been watching the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, England - which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur. That's an exclusive for you.
M	BOB	Okay. Wow. E.C.U of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are So...when did this all start for you Gus?
M	GUS LACEY	It started when I was a kid. I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say...
M	BOB	Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile.
M	GUS LACEY	I can't really talk about Bill.
M	BOB	So what did you do in the army?
M	GUS LACEY	We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was our initial tasking but...once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work... He stops, his face darkening.
M	GUS LACEY (CONT'D)	We were trained to kill animals. You mean, what...with your...?
M	GUS LACEY	With our minds. That is correct. Just by staring at them. Huh. What kind of animals?
M	GUS LACEY	One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat.
M	BOB	Wow.(Beat) I don't know what to say.
M	GUS LACEY	The power they unlocked in us... (Beat, sorrowfully) Last week I killed my hamster. (Beat) You wanna see? Bob and Gus sit watching the TV. Gus' mother hovers in
M	GUS LACEY	You ever seen a hamster do that before?
M	BOB	Well, I've never owned a hamster Gus, so I don't know what...
M	GUS LACEY	Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel.
M	BOB	Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so...
M	GUS LACEY	Good. Then they'll know how rare that is.
M	BOB	Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's...Oh, shit, he's down! ON TV one of the hamsters has fallen over.
M	GUS LACEY	Yeah, he's down. At this point I'd been staring at him for about three hours. The other hamster falls over.
M	BOB	Oh my God! You've dropped both hamsters!
M	GUS LACEY	No, the other one's just fallen over. They watch in silence. Then the hamsters get up and start
M	GUS LACEY (CONT'D)	Bizarre. Right?
M	BOB	Well...it didn't die. I thought you said you killed it? Yeah well...(He gestures to his Mother) Mother said no. She said you might be a bleeding-heart liberal. She said "Don't show him the hamster dying. Show him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead." Bob looks to Gus' Mother who manages to look nervous and This was nothing. You should have seen the Skipper at work.
M	BOB	Who's the Skipper?
M	GUS LACEY	Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy I ever met. He was like an Occultic force. (Beat) I think he runs a dance studio now. Bob straightens from lighting his cigarette, stares at
M	BOB	Do you...do you know a Gus Lacey? Beat. Lyn gets up and walks away.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Lyn? (Beat) Skip? (Beat) Lyn?
M	BOB	Whoa!
M	LYN CASSADY	You working for Hooper?
M	BOB	Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.
M	LYN CASSADY	How do you know about Lacey?
M	BOB	I interviewed him a few years ago. He'd been appearing on this radio talk show. Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head
M	LYN CASSADY	Little prick...what'd he tell you?
M	BOB	He said he joined Bill Django's unit in the army and was trained to, to, uh remote view?
M	BOB (CONT'D)	And he said the Loch Ness Monster was the ghost of a dinosaur. Who's Bill Django?
M	LYN CASSADY	Did he show you his "Home Study Course"?
M	BOB	Yes.
M	LYN CASSADY	Yeah I bet he did.
M	BOB	Are you...? Do you mean you corroborate his, uh...? Because, see, I thought he was just an idiot? He is an idiot...or he was...he's dead now. He was a paranormal whore. Always trying to get into the spotlight, yak, yak yaking. We took an oath. We don't divulge...
M	BOB	But you're saying there was a secret unit? Lyn stops, turns and stares at him.
M	LYN CASSADY	We...don't...divulge.
M	LYN CASSADY	Okay. Let me ask you something. What color were the chairs in the hotel bar? Uh...?
M	LYN CASSADY	You were in there for hours. What color were the chairs?
M	BOB	Um...brown?
M	LYN CASSADY	They were green. How many lights are there in this room? Bob starts to look around.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	A Super Soldier wouldn't need to look. He would just know.
M	BOB	A Super Soldier?
M	LYN CASSADY	A Jedi Warrior. He would know where all the lights were. He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were. People are walking around with their eyes closed. At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details. What's a Jedi Warrior?
M	LYN CASSADY	You're looking at one.
M	BOB	You're a Jedi Warrior?
M	LYN CASSADY	That's correct.
M	BOB	What does that...? I don't think I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady, Special Forces, retired. In the eighties I was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative code-named Project Jedi. The objective of the project was to create Super Soldiers.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Soldiers with Super Powers. We were the first generation of the New Earth Army. You've got super powers?
M	LYN CASSADY	That's correct.
M	BOB	Hold on, let me...let me just... He takes out his NOTEBOOK, fumbling, trying to get into Okay, so, so you're saying you were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey?
M	LYN CASSADY	We prefer the term Remote Viewer.
M	BOB	How does that work?
M	LYN CASSADY	Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse...
M	BOB	What about you? Lyn thinks about it.
M	LYN CASSADY	Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music.
M	BOB	Yeah? (Beat) Like who?
M	LYN CASSADY	I like Boston. Boston usually works. Bob jots this down in the notebook. What other powers did you practise?
M	LYN CASSADY	Invisibility.
M	BOB	Invisibility?
M	LYN CASSADY	Yup. That was Level Three.
M	BOB	Actual invisibility?
M	LYN CASSADY	Well...yeah, that was the goal. But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility. Bob tries to follow this.
M	BOB	Like camouflage?
M	LYN CASSADY	It's not like camouflage. We also practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through you. It's starts with a breathing exercise... Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Then you think black. That's the nothingness. Bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird
M	BOB	I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I don't know what to make of this. I don't know what to say. This is amazing stuff. (Beat) How would you...I wanna...could I write a story about this? Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the
M	LYN CASSADY	Not going to happen.
M	BOB	No, but see, I've been looking for a story Lyn. I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this...this is even better and
M	LYN CASSADY	Not going to happen.
M	BOB	All I'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and...
M	LYN CASSADY	I'm shipping out tomorrow.
M	BOB	You're going home?
M	LYN CASSADY	Going to Iraq. There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim. Bob's face falls.
M	BOB	Oh. They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the I could come. What?
M	BOB	I could come with you, maybe, and...
M	LYN CASSADY	Bob, I don't want to be a story, okay? I don't need the attention and...
M	BOB	No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and...
M	LYN CASSADY	It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A war. I can't be looking out for you. Bob flushes with annoyance.
M	BOB	Well you know, you don't... I look after myself. Okay? I look after...And I've been in some pretty hairy situations before. I'm not, you know...I'm a journalist, Lyn. You understand? He slaps his notebook for emphasis.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	A journalist. I go where the story is.
M	BOB (V.O.)(CONT'D)	I was an American. I was Resolute. I wanted adversity to reveal my character to the world. And to my wife. And to that one-armed cunt Dave. Lyn is staring at Bob's notebook. He takes it from Bob
M	LYN CASSADY	What's this?
M	BOB	What? Nothing. I was just doodling. Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	What's the matter? Nothing. He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and The U.S Army doesn't really have any serious alternative than to be Wonderful! Bob looks at the DISCLAIMER at the bottom of the page. This does not represent the official position of the United States Army at this time. Bob looks up at Lyn who nods gravely.
M	LYN CASSADY	You wanted to know who Bill Django was? (Beat) He's the man who wrote that book. The New Earth Army is a banner under which the forces of good can gather. The courage and nobility of the Warrior, blended with the spirituality of the Monk.
M	BOB	The Jedi Warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great Imagineers of the past - Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt Disney... 25 I/E. CAR - DAY 25 Bob is still reading. The role of The New Earth Army is to RESOLVE CONFLICT world-wide. Jedis will parachute into war zones, utilizing sparkly eyes technique, carrying symbolic flowers and animals, playing indigenous music and words of peace... INSERT: An illustration of a SOLDIER CARRYING A LAMB and
M	BOB (CONT'D)	What's the sparkly eyes technique? Lyn raises his shades and twinkles his eyes at Bob for a
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Okay.
M	LYN CASSADY	You see it?
M	BOB	I think so. (Beat) Lyn?
M	LYN CASSADY	Yeah?
M	BOB	Who is this Bill Django? Lyn draws on his cigarette thoughtfully.
M	LYN CASSADY	I don't know where to begin. WE FREEZE FRAME on his YELLING FACE just before it hits
M	LYN CASSADY	Bill always said it started for him when he fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam.
M	BILL DJANGO	Oh, man... He tries to pull his finger free, glances up and FREEZES. His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Knock-it off! Chris! Knock-it off! Bill grabs him with his free hand and shakes him, his M-
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Will you knock it off? (Climbing to his feet) Jesus. What do you think...? THUNK. A SOLDIER standing next to Bill drops, the back of
M	SILENCE.	Everyone stares at the dead man. Another shot rings out - VC in black pyjamas! One hundred meters! It's a woman! The WOMAN is jogging across the tree-line ahead, weapon
M	BILL DJANGO	Okay! Silence. Long pause.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Well!?
M	SOLDIER	What?
M	BILL DJANGO	What the fu...! Why isn't anyone firing? His men stare back at him, frightened.
M	TAKE HER OUT!	The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar. The Woman
M	BOB (V.O.)	Every single one of Bill's men fired high. They instinctively hadn't wanted to shoot another person. Later Bill would come across a study by General S.L.A Marshall, which revealed that only 15-20 percent of fresh soldiers shot to kill. The rest aimed high, didn't fire at all, or pretended to be busy doing something else. Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops Their gentleness is their strength. We begin to sink back down again, faster and faster until
M	BOB (V.O.)	Recovering in hospital, Bill wrote to General T.L Cornplow, Vice Chief of Staff for the Army, explaining that he wanted to go on a fact-finding mission to explore alternative combat tactics. The Pentagon agreed to pay his salary and expenses for the duration of the journey. We hear the opening of a period song as we... What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon was that he was really looking for the answer to the riddle of his vision. How could his men's gentleness, their general lack of interest in killing people, how could this be turned into a strength? How could love and peace help win wars? Bill knew where to go to find out. We find an uncomfortable Bill in one tub filled with One of the group runs into a tree. A LEADER gives Bill a signal and he jumps off, falls Bill senses someone staring at him and glances over to Then opens his coat to reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to Bill smiles nervously. An ARROW identifies the gunman as Bill disappeared into the New Age Movement for six years. Bill feels Thompson staring at him. He smiles nervously. Like all Shamen before him, he had traversed the wilderness. Now he was returning to his people, a changed man. The SENTRIES at the gate check Bill's PASS suspiciously.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He brought with him his confidential report - The New Earth Army Manual. The Gates swing open and Bill passes through. Does it direct your powers?
M	LYN CASSADY	What?
M	BOB	The cone. Does it direct your psychic powers or something?
M	LYN CASSADY	No. What does it do? Lyn takes some BURGERS out of a cooler box and puts them
M	LYN CASSADY	It cooks supper. He examines the stove approvingly.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Solar. Utilizing the power of the universe - no pollution, totally renewable. This is like New Earth Army technology. Bob picks up the Manual and starts to read. Lyn watches
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Pretty mind-blowing, isn't it? First time I read it, I was like...what the fuck?
M	BOB	Yes. (Beat) But... He stops.
M	LYN CASSADY	What?
M	BOB	Nothing.
M	LYN CASSADY	Go on - what?
M	BOB	Well it's just...it's hard to believe the Pentagon paid for this. I mean, it's very interesting, but there's nothing in here that's actually about...fighting?
M	LYN CASSADY	The New Earth Army was tasked with preventing conflict. We're a force of peace, not war. Bill realized if you want to change the world, you've got to start by changing the armies. He was the one that started the research into non- lethals.
M	BOB	Non-lethals? Lyn flicks away his cigarette.
M	LYN CASSADY	Check this out. He takes a yellow PLASTIC BLOB from his pocket with a
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	The Predator. The Predator? (Beat) That's a plastic blob, Lyn. (Pointing at the blob) That's a... Before he can finish Lyn has slipped Bob's finger into a
M	LYN CASSADY	You see? You're mine now. The Predator is completely biodegradable. It's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways. He takes the blob off the finger and rubs it's serrated
M	LYN CASSADY	And it looks a bit funny. This is New Earth Army technology. Lyn sticks the Predator in Bob's ear and hauls him to his
M	BOB	Stop it! Stop hurting me! Lyn stares at the blob fondly.
M	LYN CASSADY	I bought it on line. What's cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you'd never know it had such lethality. Bob holds his ear and pants for breath. Lyn's face lights Eyeballs.
M	BOB	No!!!!! Lyn checks the meat on the stove looking pissed off. It's
M	BOB	I think it's officially night now. Lyn kicks at the stove. Piece'a shit. Bob suddenly notices Lyn has taken a small black case
M	LYN CASSADY	I've got Crohn's. The steroids help.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Sometimes there's a need, Bob. Sometimes people are calling out for something, even if they don't know it themselves. And then a man like Bill appears out of nowhere, because he heard the call....
M	BILL DJANGO	I'd like us to begin this with a mantra. If we could all breathe in and then out, holding a long "eeeeee." The OFFICERS stare at him. There are sniggers. Bill Breathe in...(they comply) and out...
M	EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE	ee. They finish. Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them.
M	BILL DJANGO	We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen. Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes consumption at all costs. I believe this is America's destiny. But to achieve it we must become the first Superpower to develop super powers. We must create Warrior Monks - men and women who can fall in love with everyone, sense plant auras, pass through walls, stop saying mindless cliches and see into the future. I want you to JOIN me in this vision. (Beat) Be ALL you can BE. Bill finishes. We TRACK along the OFFICERS' FACES -
M	BOB (V.O.)	Amongst Bill's audience that night was Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, from the Defense Intelligence Agency. For some time the General had been concerned about information he had been receiving about Soviet research into psychic powers.
M	BOB (V.O.)	According to some stories the Soviets were psychically spying on American bases and had designed "psychotronic generators" - machines capable of bombarding the President with negative energy.
M	BOB (V.O.)	They were also conducting sadistic experiments to see whether animals had psychic powers. Could they, for instance, telepathically detect that their babies were distressed? With a gloating smile one of the Scientists approaches
M	BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD	Sick bastards...
M	OFFICIAL	But why did the Soviets begin this type of research?
M	BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD	Well sir, it looks like they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of our nuclear subs - the Nautilus - while it was under the Polar cap. What attempt?
M	BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD	There was no attempt, sir. It seems the story was a French hoax. But the Russians think the story about the story being a French hoax is just a story sir.
M	SECOND OFFICIAL	So, they've started psi research because they thought we were doing psi research, when in fact we weren't doing psi research?
M	BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD	Yes sir. But now that they are doing psi research, we're going to have to do psi research, sir. We can't afford to have the Russians leading the field in the paranormal. The Officials consider this gravely.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Two weeks later the Army adopted the slogan Be All You Can Be and appointed Bill Commander of the first New Earth Army Battalion. Lyn?
M	BOB	Oh God. Oh God. He stops, staring at the immense empty landscape ahead of
M	LYN CASSADY (O.S.)	What? Bob turns and sees Lyn in a YOGA pose on the roof of the
M	BOB	I didn't...I thought...What are you doing?
M	LYN CASSADY	Salute to the Sun. He finishes and jumps down.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Okay. We're Oscar Mike. (Getting up) That's "On the Move" soldier.
M	53 INSIDE THE CAR 53	Bob is writing in his notebook as Lyn drives. He notices
M	BOB	What are you doing?
M	LYN CASSADY	Cloud bursting. Keeps me in shape. Bob stares up at the clouds.
M	BOB	Really? Which one? That one. Bob tries to work out which cloud he means.
M	BOB	That one?
M	LYN CASSADY	No. That one. The big one.
M	BOB	Isn't that one too far away? Lyn looks at Bob like he's crazy.
M	LYN CASSADY	They're all far away.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	And it's gone. Lyn, smiling up at the sky, doesn't notice that the car The two men stand staring at the wrecked front of the
M	BOB	Jesus Lyn. You had like the whole desert to drive in... Lyn rubs his face ruefully.
M	LYN CASSADY	Yeah. I'm sorry about that Bob. Must have got a little bi- locational there, you know? But don't worry. Someone'll come along soon.
M	LYN WHEATON	Heads.
M	BOB	Right. He tosses again.
M	LYN WHEATON	Heads. Right. He tosses again. What's your record at this?
M	LYN WHEATON	Two hundred and sixty four. Tails. Right. That's pretty... He stops, listening. We hear the sound of an approaching
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Oh thank Christ. Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Can you help us? We drove into a rock. Could you take us to a town or someplace? Smiling, the Iraqi gestures to the back of the pick-up. Thank you! Thanks so much! He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the
M	BOB	Hi! Hello there. Thanks so much for this. The two Young Men smile in a friendly fashion. Don't know if we would have lasted much longer. Phew! One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh? The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's
M	YOUNG IRAQI	Deep Purple. They laugh.
M	BOB	Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep Purple. Right. You guys like Deep Purple? You like rock or, or... He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Lyn? Is this...is this...? Yeah.
M	BOB	We're going to die! I'm going to be killed by Al Qaeda!
M	LYN CASSADY	I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
M	BOB	Oh what the hell do you know? You don't know! You don't know anything! And this is all your fault!
M	LYN CASSADY	Bob, there's something I have to tell you. When I said I was retired from the unit, that was a lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was just my cover. I've been reactivated. I couldn't tell you because this is a Black Op, but...I think you have a part to play. I think that's why you're with me. Bob collapses face down on the mattress. You're an idiot. You want to know why I'm with you? Because I got drunk. (Starting to cry a little) I got drunk and I just wanted to get into Iraq so I could prove to my wife I wasn't...just once that I...And now I'm going to die. She's right. I'm such a... He dissolves into misery. Lyn watches with sympathy.
M	LYN CASSADY	Have you heard of Optimum Trajectory before? (No answer) Your life is like a river, Bob. If you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That's not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Like those doodles you just "happened" to draw? He unbuttons his shirt and reveals an EYE tattooed on his This is the Ajna chakra - the third eye - the symbol of the Jedi. When I saw you'd drawn it...well, the Universe gives me a sign like that, I don't ignore it. You're meant to be here with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you sensed that. Bob stares at the EYE.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Now listen to me. I don't think these guys are FRL's or Mehdi Army... I think we're talking standard criminals here, okay? What they're gonna do is try and sell us on to another group. We can't let that happen.
M	BOB	How are we gonna stop them? There's three of them! And they've got guns!
M	LYN CASSADY	We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't fight with guns. We fight with our minds.
M	BOB	What do you mean?
M	LYN CASSADY	Let's say we have no choice but to fight with these men. Then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack. What do you mean?
M	LYN CASSADY	Okay, you lock eyes with one of them, you go into a monotone and you say "No, I'm not going to attack you." You totally relax your body and your voice. And then you rip out one of his eyeballs.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Or you use a pen, stab him in the neck, create a fountain of blood, I mean really a fountain, get the blood to squirt on his buddies. That's a psychic disincentive, right there. Bob thinks about this, a little nauseated.
M	BOB	We haven't got a pen. You're missing the point. something. Stand up. Bob stands up reluctantly.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Choke me.
M	BOB	Oh...I don't want to Lyn.
M	LYN CASSADY	Choke me. What am I gonna do? (pointing at his throat) Just here. Choke. Choke.
M	BOB	I don't think I...there's sharp edges around here...
M	LYN CASSADY	C'mon...(making quotation marks with his fingers) "Attack me." Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this.
M	BOB	What's with the quotation fingers? That's like implying I'm you know...only capable of ironic attacking or...
M	LYN CASSADY	Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me. Well, if I choose to choke you, what are you going to do?
M	LYN CASSADY	I'm going to interrupt your thought pattern.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	See? I hardly moved. Physics wise there's not much going on. It's the psychic energy that's important. (Beat) You okay?
M	BOB	Sharp...edges...
M	LYN CASSADY	You felt fear didn't you? Before hand? Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself.
M	BOB	Yes.
M	LYN CASSADY	Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you? Bob thinks about this.
M	BOB	I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual. You know why? It wasn't you. It was me. I was inside your head. Fighting with the Mind. Suddenly the door opens and one of the Young Iraqis comes
M	YOUNGER IRAQI	Okay. We go. I'm sorry I freaked out, Lyn.
M	LYN CASSADY	That's okay. You learnt a lesson. "Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has power." Huh.
M	LYN CASSADY	Oprah.
M	BOB	Uhuh. (Beat) You really don't work for DeWitts?
M	LYN CASSADY	Just my cover. Gus Lacey said you ran a dance studio. That was just cover too, right?
M	LYN CASSADY	No. I do run a dance school. I love dance.
M	BOB	Oh. Okay. (Beat) And you're really on a mission out here?
M	LYN CASSADY	In time, Bob. Were you just kidding me back there - about me having some Jedi in me?
M	LYN CASSADY	We learn to recognize our own kind after a while. You ever dream about flying?
M	BOB	Yes.
M	LYN CASSADY	That's one of the signs.
M	BOB	Do you really think so?
M	LYN CASSADY	Don't you? Haven't you always really felt you were different? Bob considers this.
M	BOB	Yes. Yes I have.
M	LYN CASSADY	That's the way it is for us. We're the ones who don't fit in as kids.
M	BOB	Have you always had powers?
M	LYN CASSADY	Kind of. They used to call me the Jinx.
M	BOB	Why?
M	TECHNICIAN	Foxtrot-117 has launched. Tracking now. Charlie-Oscar 31.8066667... Lyn (30's), in uniform, walks past and both computers
M	VOICE	We just lost contact! Request status? Oh Crap! The TECHNICIANS turn to stare after Lyn. We hear a SIREN
M	BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD	Did you crash those computers? Lyn opens his mouth to lie, but one glance at Hopgood's Yes sir. Beat. A SLOW GRIN steals over the General's face. Far fucking out... Lyn blinks. This wasn't the reaction he'd expected.
M	BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD	How'd you feel about a transfer son?
M	BILL DJANGO	I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django. From now on, you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your mouth will be "Sir, yes, sir!" Do you understand?
M	RECRUITS	Sir, yes, sir!
M	BILL DJANGO	If you complete this course you will be a Psychic Weapon, an Angel of Death, our enemies Worst Nightmare! Until then you are Nothing! Less than Nothing! Do you understand? Yeah, I'm only kidding with that shit. Okay, what shall we do now? He stares around the men, expectantly.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Hey! Lets dance!
M	BILL DJANGO	Okay! Give it everything you've got! That's it! The Jedis start to dance more frenetically, eyes closed, What's your name son?
M	LYN CASSADY	Lyn Cassady sir.
M	BILL DJANGO	Where you from?
M	LYN CASSADY	Opelousas, Louisiana, sir. Bill stares at Lyn, taking in his orphan air, his hunted
M	BILL DJANGO	Tough place to grow up?
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	You've gotta free your feet before you can free your mind, Lyn. Not much of a dancer sir. Bill examines Lyn's face through narrowed eyes.
M	BILL DJANGO	But that isn't true is it Lyn? You can dance. It's just someone told you not to. 63 BEDROOM - 1965 63
M	LYN'S FATHER	Stop acting so fucking QUEER! He throws his beer can at Lyn and walks on. Lyn stares
M	BILL DJANGO	Well, I'm your commanding officer Lyn, and I'm ordering you to let the dance out! Lyn starts to dance with a little more abandon.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	C'mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go! Let it all go! Lyn starts to go for it. And it's true - he CAN dance.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Welcome to the Heroes Journey Lyn. Lyn smiles shyly.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Okay remember everyone, we don't officially exist as a unit so I'm afraid there's no coffee budget. Bring your own coffee. Oh, and no solid food for the first week. As the track continues we...
M	SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS	"I don't know but I've been told Eskimo Pussy is mighty cold..."
M	JEDI WARRIORS	Ommmm... Okay, you're doing very well. Now feel the next bend...
M	BILL DJANGO	Okay, only when you're ready. The Jedi nods nervously, hesitates, starts to WALK ON THE Think cold! Think real cold!
M	JEDIS	Mother Earth, my life support system as a soldier, I must drink your blue water. I pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat. I am yours and you are mine. I salute you. We find Lyn dancing in blissful, idiotic abandonment.
M	BOB (V.O.)	After years of feeling like an oddball Lyn had finally found a home. At last he was amongst men who prided themselves on being different.
M	BOB (V.O.)	These were Golden Days for Lyn. There was something so noble and pure in Bill's vision that the Jedis felt themselves inspired to be more than soldiers. In a world torn apart by greed and hate they would be a force for good, for peace. A BUTTERFLY lands on Lyn's outstretched hand. He watches For the first time in his life Lyn felt truly happy. The Butterfly flits away and lands on an APPLE in the Then into the garden a serpent did come.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi writer from Colorado, recruited to the Jedis after Brigadier General Hopgood met him at a spoon-bending party. Other guests laugh and applaud.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Right from the start he had made himself unpopular with the other Jedis. Scotty and his wife are walking off the dance floor.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Congratulations Scotty. I'm sorry it doesn't work out for you two. Scotty's face falls. The other Jedis glare at Larry. One
M	BOB (V.O.)	Larry made it quite clear that he despised most of the other Jedis. Feeling sorry for him Lyn sits beside Larry. Larry
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	But Lyn - Lyn was different. (Beat) He really hated Lyn. The three men focus on the cupboard in question.
F	SCOTTY	It's...it's something cylindrical? I think it's a pencil?
M	BILL DJANGO	Okay. Larry? Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high
M	LARRY HOOPER	This is Larry's Spirit Guide, Maud. I'm looking into the cupboard now and I'm seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?
M	BILL DJANGO	Lyn? Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly,
M	LYN CASSADY	It's a man on a chair. Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you said K, not A! Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn.
M	BILL DJANGO	Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding. Larry looks daggers at Lyn.
M	BILL DJANGO	Aikido is a vehicle for harmonizing ourselves with the Universe and the Way. Look upon these sessions as an opportunity to discover yourself and your training partner in a loving environment.
M	LATER	Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Notice how Lyn's circular motions turned Larry's aggression back upon him. Good work Lyn. A CHAIR flies through the frame, just missing Lyn's head.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Larry, go outside, calm down. Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of After a year's training, Lyn was given his first tasking. A senior Nato General had been kidnapped by Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill was unofficially asked if his unit would be able to help find him before it was too late. We're north of Verona. It's a little town. There's a lake nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across from the Cinema is a shop or, or...it's a cafe. He's in the apartment above. The town is called...it's something sweet. (Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce. Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking
M	BOB (V.O.)	It's true that the unit never found out whether any of their remote viewings were accurate or not. Nevertheless from that moment on Lyn's reputation soared.
M	BILL DJANGO	Rank, medals...these things mean little to the Jedi. But growth in spirit, in wisdom, in psychic power, these things earn our respect. He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	Native Americans believed that when one received an Eagle feather, it was the mark of love, of gratitude and ultimate respect. Only true Human Beings may carry the Eagle feather. He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other
M	BOB (V.O.)	The word soon got out in the intelligence community that there was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who could find whatever you needed found. It was as if Lyn could fly anywhere in the world without leaving his room. We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	As Bill Django said - the Force truly was strong with this one. As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the Two MEN dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering
M	YOUNG IRAQI	Etaharrak!
M	BOB	Lyn? It's okay, Bob. We're not getting into that truck. The First Young Iraqi gestures more angrily at the Truck.
M	YOUNG IRAQI	Edkhol!
M	LYN CASSADY	Don't move Bob.
M	BOB	Are you going to use the Blob?
M	LYN CASSADY	Let's hope it doesn't come to that. One of the Insurgents stirs and says something softly in Lyn raises one hand towards him.
M	LYN CASSADY	You can put your weapon away. You're not interested in us. The Young Iraqi points the gun at Bob who starts to walk Stay where you are Bob. Bob stops.
M	BOB	Shit...shit...
M	LYN CASSADY	We can go about our business. Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his La termi, ana sahafi! Terrified Bob, dives across the sand. The Young Iraqi Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM, HUNG IN MID-AIR.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Now at the time I thought Lyn was having some kind of fit here. Later I discovered what he was actually doing was performing the Echmeyer technique.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet with sixty-three confirmed kills. He remains the only non-Korean to achieve the rank of Master in Kwa Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi teachers at Fort Bragg.
M	REVERSE	SHOOTING from behind Ben to the rows of JEDI RECRUITS
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It was said he could have a tug of war with a dozen men and not move an inch. We PAN DOWN the back of BEN and find he is NAKED from the He was also able to lift bags of sand on hooks hung through his scrotum. A RECRUIT raises a hand.
M	JEDI RECRUIT	Sir, what's the practical application of this?
M	BOB (V.O.)	Another demonstration involved letting a recruit drive a jeep over him. This, in the end, was to be his undoing. Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP.
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Before his untimely death Ben caused quite a stir by advocating his controversial "shock and awe" knife attack method.
M	BOB (V.O.)	The approach was hailed by some knife aficionados as revolutionary but criticized by others who believed that the leaping and spinning might lead you to accidentally stab yourself. TRACKING ALONG BEN'S TRAINEE JEDIS - as they watch his
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Lyn Cassady, however, became a firm convert to the style. We reach LYN who TURNS TO CAMERA.
M	LYN CASSADY	Ben, you're not forgotten. The knife you gave me lies next to my beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer. Of course, Lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so I still think what he did was kinda...reckless. The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his
M	INSIDE THE TRUCK	Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at
M	BOB	They're not coming! We're okay! Oh God, we're gonna be okay! The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running
M	LYN CASSADY	There he is. He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the Lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Sir? You're okay! We're Americans. We're here to help you! Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him, Oh crap!
M	BOB	What happened? I think I just ran him over.
M	LYN CASSADY	Sir? Are you okay? (Beat) Bob, give me a hand here will you? Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to They stop listening to an approaching rumble.
M	BOB	Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming! They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and ARMED MEN'S P.O.V - Lyn and Bob stare at them before
M	LAPTOP SCREEN	We're rushing over a CGI DESERT, between the CGI rivers
M	NIXON (O.S.)	Then I say "There it is. The Future!" Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the
M	NIXON (CONT'D)	We play this on these big screens at the conferences, you know? This trumpet music blasting out. Every time I see it, it gets me. He glances over at the Iraqi Man who is holding a
M	NIXON (CONT'D)	You a businessman, sir? The Iraqi Man nods.
M	NIXON (CONT'D)	Yeah, Ali Babas have been targeting locals lately.(Holding out his hand) Todd Nixon, Army Small Business Office. Mahmud Daash.
M	NIXON	Ask me what business I'm in, Muhammad. Mahmud. What business are you in sir?
M	NIXON	Right now, I'm in the Quality of Life business. Nixon nods, smiling, pleased with the line.
M	NIXON (CONT'D)	We've got 25 million Iraqis out here who wanna be independent, wanna make something of their lives. But more than anything else they wanna buy stuff. Cell phones, digital cameras, leisure suits - you name it. If it sells in Boston, then we can damn well sell it in Baghdad! (To Mahmud) Am I right Muhammad? (To Bob) He knows what I'm talking about. We've got Halliburton, Parsons, Perini...just in the primes. We're gonna have Macdonalds, we're gonna have Starbucks...No corporate tax. It's a gold-rush. Oh, and by the way, fuck the French! (Laughing) Did you hear that shit? Chirac wants to bring French contractors in? Can you believe that? Hey, Phil? Raise one hand if you like the French.
M	THE DRIVER	Raise both your hands if you are French! He raises both his hands. Yeah, okay...watch the wheel Phil. (To Bob) Year Zero boys. Bob nods politely.
M	THE BACK SEAT	Lyn prepares an INJECTION for himself. He feels the
M	LYN CASSADY	What's Krom? The Security Guard continues to watch him through his
M	SECURITY MAN	God of War. Really? Is that Norse?
M	SECURITY MAN	Conan the Barbarian. S'in the movie. Lyn injects himself.
M	LYN CASSADY	Right. Lyn notices the Chilean Security Guard on his other side Okay. We're in Indian Country. Check six. The SUV's are approaching a town and other cars have
M	NIXON	I was pretty down for a while about not getting any trigger time in this war Bob, but you know what I've learnt? Our greatest weapon against evil is commerce. When these people have quality consumer items they will no longer want to kill Americans. He turns to gaze at the TOWN they are now driving into.
M	NIXON (CONT'D)	We're not gonna rest until there's a satellite dish on every one of
M	THOSE	roofs. Behind him the sound of CARS BRAKING AND SWERVING The driver of the first SUV radios Nixon's car.
M	FIRST DRIVER (O.S.)	We've got a line for the gas station here. Are we waiting?
M	NIXON'S DRIVER	Negative. We'd be way too exposed. We're taking the station. Go in fangs out. He accelerates.
M	TEXAN SECURITY MAN	Secure the perimeter! The men fan out to the corners of the station, while the Inside the SUV Bob, Lyn and Mahmud watch in astonishment.
M	TEXAN SECURITY MAN (CONT'D)	Give her the go-juice, Eddy!
M	CHILEAN SECURITY MAN	I filled her up last time.
M	TEXAN SECURITY MAN	Bullshit.
M	NIXON	He did fill her up last time Gary.
M	TEXAN SECURITY MAN	With respect sir, bull-fucking- shit. I tanked her last time.
M	THIRD SECURITY MAN	Every time! Can we get some sort of fucking system so we don't... We hear a sudden, sharp POPPING sound. Immediately the Contact! We've got contact! He opens FIRE - IMMEDIATE CHAOS: people scream, duck Where? Where's the shooter?
M	NEW SECURITY MAN	Contact! We're under fire! The New Detachment open FIRE blindly in the general ...as bullets smack off the parked SUV.
M	THIRD SECURITY MAN	Two o'clock! Two o'clock! All the Security Men turns and begin spraying bullets
M	INSIDE THE SUV	A scowling Nixon has slid low in his seat.
M	NIXON	Trying to help you fucking savages. Mahmud, Bob and Lyn are lying flat on the seats.
M	MAHMUD DAASH	My house is not far. We could walk from here. Bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the SUV.
M	BOB	Sounds good Muhammad.
M	MAHMUD DAASH	Mahmud.
M	102 GAS STATION 102	As machine-gun fire from across the street strafes the
M	FIRST SECURITY MAN	Krom One this is Freedom Frontier. We are under attack. This is a FUBAR situation. Requesting Kiowa! Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter
M	BOB (V.O.)	Muhammad led us to his home which it turned out had been robbed in his absence. We TRACK past a row of BULLET HOLES in the wall, a And also accidentally set on fire by a US tank. Neighbors told him his wife had left, they weren't sure where she had gone. We reach Bob, Lyn and Mahmud eating at a low table. The
M	LYN CASSADY	What is this?
M	MAHMUD DAASH	Taameeyah.
M	LYN CASSADY	They're really good. Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs.
M	BOB (V.O.)	I understood he was going through a lot, but considering we had saved him from kidnappers I still thought his welcome could have been a little warmer. Lyn clears his throat.
M	LYN CASSADY	I'm very sorry for running you over, sir. Mahmud shrugs.
M	MAHMUD DAASH	It was an accident. And I apologize for that security detachment. Please don't think all Americans are like that. Mahmud nods. Beat.
M	MAHMUD DAASH	I apologize for the kidnappers. Lyn demurs softly.
M	LYN CASSADY	Not your fault sir. I mean we get kidnappers in America too, so...you know. There's always, uh, bad apples, right? The men eat in silence for a moment. Mahmud stares Mahmud looks at him, startled perhaps by the unexpected
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	Did I say it wrong? Mahmud shakes his head, moved but embarrassed.
M	MAHMUD DAASH	No...that was right. They eat in silence.
M	BOB	Lyn?
M	LYN CASSADY	What?
M	BOB	What are you thinking?
M	LYN CASSADY	Just Mahmud. People try to build something of their lives, something lasting, something good... but there's always someone wants to smash it up... Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper and the part he had played in the destruction of the New earth Army. But, in fairness, the Jedis' own eccentricities hadn't exactly won them many allies in the Army. A JEDI - TIM KOOTZ - lies on the couch in a TRANCE, Bill
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	For example, there was Tim Kootz who, on being asked to ascertain the whereabouts of General Manuel Noriega, had replied... Tim jerks awake from his trance. Ask Angela Lansbury. What's that Tim?
M	TIM KOOTZ	Ask Angela Lansbury. Bill looks up to an CIA AGENT observing from the next
M	CIA AGENT	We asked Angela Lansbury.
M	BILL DJANGO	And?
M	CIA AGENT	She said she didn't know where General Noriega was. Or there was the time Major General Gilling was visiting the base and saw Jedi trainee Clifford Hickox... RUSSELL'S P.O.V - we are driving past the training ...practising the ancient Sun Dance of the Sioux Nation.
M	BOB (V.O.)	The Jedis survived such minor scandals, protected, it was rumored, by a President who was a fan of both the Star Wars films and the paranormal himself. But then, one summer, a young, likeable Lieutenant called Norman Pendleton was recruited to the New Earth Army... Larry Hooper examines the new recruit with interest.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Larry Hooper wasted no time befriending the newcomer. Desperate to compete with Lyn, Larry had been doing research into the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments which he believed could enhance his own psychic powers. All he needed was a lab rat to try them out on, check if they were safe. Larry, making sure Norm can't see, is pouring a massive
M	BOB (V.O.)	It turned out they weren't. Norm? Give me the gun, Norm. Norm starts to cry. Then he puts the gun into his
M	BOB (V.O.)	Norm's father, who it turned out was pretty high up in the Pentagon, wanted blood.
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Although the Jedis were pretty sure Larry was responsible, nothing could be proved and when he was called to the disciplinary hearing Larry made sure to smear Bill with everything he could...
M	LARRY HOOPER	Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds from the project's black budget to procure prostitutes... The OFFICIALS listening register shock and dismay. Bill
M	BILL DJANGO	That's a lie!
M	LARRY HOOPER	...and also drugs for himself and his men. Bill jumps to his feet again.
M	BILL DJANGO	That's a...(catches himself) Well the hooker thing is definitely a lie! The OFFICIALS look at him as if he were SATAN himself.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Brigadier General Hopgood resigned and died some years later. Bill received a dishonorable discharge.
M	BILL DJANGO	Continue the work, Lyn. The World needs the Jedis, now more than ever. Lyn can't speak. Bill hugs him and walks off, the gates
M	BOB (V.O.)	After Bill left, Major Holtz of Special Forces took command of the Jedis. Lyn stares at his reflection as his long hair falls to
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And nothing was ever the same again. Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over
M	LYN CASSADY	I really appreciate this sir. Lyn sits staring out at the emptiness, looking, perhaps Jesus Christ. We could'a bought a map if you'd said.
M	LYN CASSADY	Bedouins have been navigating this desert for centuries without maps. You can use a wrist-watch in conjunction with the sun.
M	BOB	Well?
M	LYN CASSADY	What? Well...use your watch.
M	LYN CASSADY	I haven't got a watch.
M	BOB	Oh for the love of...Here... He gives Lyn his watch. Lyn looks at the watch and turns What?
M	LYN CASSADY	This is a digital watch, Bob.
M	BOB	So? That's...
M	LYN CASSADY	So you need a watch with hands for Christ's sake!
M	BOB	Well how the hell am I supposed to know?
M	BOB (CONT'D)	You're the navigation expert here. You told me you could find the way.
M	LYN CASSADY	Will, if you'd just be quiet for a...
M	BOB	Turns out you haven't even got a watch! Now what the hell are we...
M	LYN CASSADY	Will you shut up? I don't need a watch. I'm using Level Two. What?
M	LYN CASSADY	Level Two. Intuition. We were trained to make correct decisions. Somebody runs up to you and says "There's a fork in the road. Do we turn left or do we turn right? And "We go right!" Bob stares at him.
M	BOB	Just...instant?
M	LYN CASSADY	Just like that. Lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Oh, it's that way? Yes. It's this way.
M	BOB	Right. Now you know. BOOM. We see the flash of the explosion and the Renault What...what happened? Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He What?
M	LYN CASSADY	Improvised Explosive Device.
M	BOB	Oh Jesus.
M	LYN CASSADY	You're okay Bob. It's gonna be okay.
M	BOB	I can't believe this. Great fucking intuition Lyn. I can't...put me down. I can walk. Put me down. Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez.
M	LYN CASSADY	Alright, c'mon... He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him
M	BOB	Where are we going? We should stay with the car so the army can find us.
M	LYN CASSADY	Fedayeen will find us first.
M	BOB	Well, I disagree. I totally disagree.(Beat) The Federal what?
M	LYN CASSADY	Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary. Fellas who probably laid the IED. They could be on their way now. Hold this Bob. He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence
M	BOB	What are you doing?
M	LYN CASSADY	Could be IED's or mines around here. I'm checking for disturbances in the telluric current.
M	BOB	Are they my glasses? Lyn doesn't answer, keeps on walking, struggling a little
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Jesus, it's hot. I'm so hot. (Beat) Aren't you hot?
M	LYN CASSADY	Bob? It's pretty important you keep your mouth closed, okay? You can lose a lot of water through an open mouth. He staggers on with him.
M	BOB	I can't breathe properly. I can't...Oh boy... He staggers, manages not to fall.
M	LYN CASSADY	You're okay.
M	BOB	I think I'm bleeding to death.
M	LYN CASSADY	You're not bleeding to death, Bob. It's shock, okay? It's just the shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be okay.
M	BOB	If we'd stayed at the road we would be safe now! Now we've got no water, no food or, or... forget about the fucking tantric currents? You're going to be okay.
M	BOB	Stop saying that! I just got blown up! I'm in the middle of a desert!
M	LYN CASSADY	Bob, you're suffering from shock. If you start panicking now your heart's gonna stop. Bob stares after him incredulously.
M	BOB	Is that...is that supposed to calm me down?! (hurrying after him) You know what color the seats were in the frigging hotel but you can't...you wanna observe something Lyn? Observe the fucking bomb in the middle of the road!
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Wait a minute. That's west. Al Qaim's in that direction. We're going the wrong way.
M	LYN CASSADY	The mission isn't in Al Qaim. It's somewhere near Al Qaim.
M	BOB	Where? I don't know.
M	BOB	Is that...is that...is that a joke? We've come six hundred miles and you don't know where we're going?
M	LYN CASSADY	If the exact whereabouts of the Target was known it wouldn't take a Jedi to find them, would it? Bob watches Lyn stare around him, looking pale and drawn
M	BOB	Who gave you the mission Lyn? (Beat) Lyn?
M	LYN CASSADY	Bill did.
M	BOB	What?
M	LYN CASSADY	Bill did. He appeared in my trailer two months ago. A psychic projection. I could hear him calling my name. Bob is so staggered by this for a moment he can't speak. Oh...Oh Jesus.
M	LYN CASSADY	He needed me.
M	BOB	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Lyn. There's no mission? We're in the middle of the desert because you heard voices? There's no one here! There's no-one fucking here. Lyn starts to walk off but staggers and falls.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Lyn! Bob rushes to him, kneels beside him. Lyn clutches his
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Is it the Crohns?
M	LYN CASSADY	I don't have Crohns.
M	BOB	What's the matter with you?
M	LYN CASSADY	I'm dying. Bob stares at him, stunned.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	I've been murdered.
M	LYN CASSADY	It's gone Bob. I can't find him. I've lost my power. It's the curse.
M	BOB	What curse?
M	LYN CASSADY	They took this... beautiful thing we'd been building and they corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army.
M	BOB	Who destroyed it? Lyn stares at the stars above, remembering, grief
M	LYN CASSADY	I did.
M	MAJOR HOLTZ	Yoga is not the business of the US Army, ladies. Drumming circles are not the business of the Army. And love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army. So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves winning fucking wars!
M	BOB (V.O.)	When the dust of the Pendleton Affair had settled it revealed a surprising victor.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper as a patriotic whistle-blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious barrel of apples.
M	LARRY HOOPER	It's some scientific research I've done for possible offensive psi applications sir. (Beat) I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn't seem interested. Holtz snorts angrily. I bet he wasn't. He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause. We have men who can do this?
M	LARRY HOOPER	I think I know one sir. Holtz ponders the report, tempted.
M	MAJOR HOLTZ	But we don't have the resources.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Well sir...there is goat lab?
M	BOB (V.O.)	Goat Lab was originally created as a clandestine laboratory to provide in-the-field surgical training for Special Forces soldiers. We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	The goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully. Goat lab actually used to be called Dog Lab... 134 SMALL DOG STARING AT US 134
M	BOB (V.O.)	But it turned out most soldiers didn't feel good shooting dogs in the leg... A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in ...whereas the army had long felt fine about doing stuff to goats - even testing atomic weapons on them. We hear the drone of an AEROPLANE high, high above. The And the Goat falls over. Holy shit. Beat. The goat gets back up, shakes itself and walks off.
M	LYN CASSADY	This was the real deal, Bob. I was at the Gateway. Afterwards I realized I'd got injured.
M	BOB	Huh?
M	LYN CASSADY	Sympathetic injury I guess. I was bruised all over.
M	BOB	So, it's not that the goat fought back? Goat didn't have a chance.
M	BOB	But...that was it?
M	LYN CASSADY	I wish it was. Hooper told Holtz we should try the experiment again. Only this time they said...kill the goat.
M	MAJOR HOLTZ	Take out number four. Lyn stares at the number.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Lyn said he had no intention of killing the goat.
M	LYN CASSADY	There was no way! What had the goat ever done to me? It was totally against the way of the Jedi. I was just going to pretend to try so they would say, "okay - it can't be done" and forget about it. But then, as I sat there, I felt this, this pulse start inside of me and...I couldn't stop it. He turns to look at Bob, haunted.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	You know what I keep thinking?
M	CLOSE ON LYN	...as he stares, concentrating. Maybe deep down inside some dark part of me wanted to see if I could do it?
M	VIDEO FOOTAGE	Grainy, flickering black and white footage of the six The goat is dead. The three men stare at him. Goat number four? No. Number five.
M	BOB	Collateral damage?
M	LYN CASSADY	Collateral damage. (Beat) That was it. I'd used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all. Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck. Every night I'd dream of that goat in its little bib, it's mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out... Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness.
M	BOB	The silence of the goats. Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured
M	LYN CASSADY	I finished my tour and I quit. I walked out of the unit and I never went back.
M	BOB (V.O.)	But before he could leave Larry arranged one last parting gift. Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper
M	LYN CASSADY	What do you wan...? Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	What the hell? Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh It was the Dim Mak.
M	BOB	The Dim Mak?
M	LYN CASSADY	The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm. The Death Touch. It's like this legendary, martial arts move. It was forbidden in the New Earth Army. Larry had got it from a mail- order book. What does the Death Touch do?
M	LYN CASSADY	It kills you Bob. With one touch.
M	BOB	Jesus.
M	LYN CASSADY	There's a story that Wong Wifu, great Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded. That was it. He'd given him the death touch and Wong died.
M	BOB	Then and there?
M	LYN CASSADY	No. Eighteen years later. That's the weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it's going to take effect. He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying, CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned. At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A In the BLACK we hear a VOICE.
M	ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.)	In America if I do not like my cell-phone company I change them. I am in charge. This is consumer power.
M	ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.)	This is democracy. Let us work together for that. And please stop shooting at those who are only here to help. Lyn opens his eyes, looks around him.
M	ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)	This is an old one from Cat Stevens. (Correcting himself) Yusef Islam. That's Yusef Islam. Lyn looks at the door and for a second there's a FLASH OF
M	BOB	Lyn? The door at the end of the corridor is just CLOSING. Lyn Lyn? Where are you going? We pass to the next room which seems to be a RECORDING A door slides shut with a clang nearby and Lyn turns to A trail of FOOTPRINTS leads across the sand to a HANGAR Lyn heads off across the sand, dragging the IV. Bob
M	BOB	Lyn! Lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags I don't think we should... He stops following Lyn's gaze...
M	INSIDE THE BUILDING	The place is full of GOATS. Lyn and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances Lyn stares at him. Hello Bill. Bill smiles hesitantly.
M	BILL DJANGO	Hello Lyn. Lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer.
M	LYN CASSADY	This is Bob.
M	BILL DJANGO	Hello Bob. Bob is too amazed to reply. Oh good... Bob and Lyn turn to find Larry Hooper standing in the
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	...the gang's all here. Lyn stares at Larry - shocked.
M	LARRY HOOPER	This is primarily a Psyops base.
M	BOB	Psy for psychic? Psy for psychological, although the irony isn't wasted on me. Radio broadcasts, leaflets, that sort of thing. Bob picks up a LEAFLET.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	Oh, that's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet they dropped on us. "American Soldier - your wives are back home having sex with Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds."
M	LARRY HOOPER	Yeah, hadn't exactly done their homework there. Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	How'd you find us, Lyn?
M	LYN CASSADY	I remote viewed you. Larry smiles a little mockingly.
M	BOB	If this is Psyops what are you doing here?
M	LARRY HOOPER	I said primarily Psyops. This is a restricted area, you understand? Everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison. Bob nods a little nervously.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	There are individuals in the current administration who are looking for...creative solutions for the War on Terror.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	They're far more open minded then their predecessors, and they've out-sourced experimental research to my company. He indicates the PSIC name badge he's wearing.
M	BOB	"Sick?"
M	LARRY HOOPER	It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic Systems International Corp. Turns out certain people had heard about the New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then. They got in touch with me, I got in touch with Bill.
M	LYN CASSADY	You're working for him? Bill frowns at the CDs, not seeming to hear.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Bill's been looking into subliminal messaging. (Selecting a disc) This is one we've designed to play to our own troops before combat. He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a
M	BOB	There's a subliminal message in this?
M	LARRY HOOPER	This is..."Don't get drunk before firing heavy machine guns." We've got all sort of products in development.(To Worker) Tell them one of our new ideas.
M	PSIC WORKER	Air bag mine?
M	LARRY HOOPER	Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine, catapults the fucker up into air. (To another) Gimme another one.
M	2ND PSIC WORKER	Blast target with pheromones and then release Attack Bees.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces of Nature! Another.
M	1ST PSIC WORKER	Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy corpses and...
M	LARRY HOOPER	We're not doing that anymore! Idiot! He turns back to Lyn.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	The point is we've got a budget, we've got supporters. I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army. Only this time without the hippy crap. Bill stands up and starts walking a little unsteadily
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	You okay Bill?
M	BILL DJANGO	Gonna get some ice-cream. Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to
M	LARRY HOOPER	You get the odd flash of what he used to be but... he's pretty burnt out with the booze. Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	Ooo, Twizzlers. He picks it up and starts to eat it.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	You want one? Lyn shakes his head, trying not to show the emotions he
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	God, I love these things... Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell, illuminated
M	SONG (O.S.)	The prisoner looks terrified, and despite the whimsical What? What is it?
M	LYN CASSADY	It's the Dark Side.
M	BOB	What are you going to do? Lyn stares at the wall. Lyn? What are you going to do?
M	LYN CASSADY	It's too late...I'm dying, Bob.
M	BOB	Oh, you're not dying! I don't believe you can kill someone with a mail order Dim Sum. You can't...
M	LYN CASSADY	Dim Mak.
M	BOB	Whatever. I don't believe you can just...
M	LYN CASSADY	It's cancer.
M	BOB	...just tap someone and ...it...(Beat) What?
M	LYN CASSADY	I mean, I know it was caused by the Dim Mak. But...it's...you know...it's cancer. That's what the doctors say. Different ways of looking at...different names for a reality or, or uh... He lapses into silence. Bob is stunned. Lyn lies down.
M	LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)	I shouldn't have come Bob. Shouldn't have come. Lyn pulls the EAGLE FEATHER from the chain around his ...Give this back to Bill...I don't deserve it. Bob stares at him.
M	BOB	I think you should go and see Lyn, sir. (Beat) he needs you. Bill doesn't answer. The man crossed a desert to see you again. Bill takes a long drink, stares at the sky. Bob watches
M	BOB (CONT'D)	You know, he told me all these stories about Bill Django, and I was pretty excited to meet you, but I've gotta tell you...you're one big disappointment. Bill doesn't react. Bob starts to walk away then turns
M	BOB (CONT'D)	He told me to give you that back. I don't know why. Its supposed to be a mark of honour isn't it? I don't see how you deserve that. Beat. Bill turns to look at Bob for the first time. He It isn't real.
M	BOB	What isn't?
M	BILL DJANGO	The feather. Twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather. This one's off a turkey. You just die the tip black. (Beat) Don't tell Lyn. Bill stares at the feather.
M	BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)	None of it was real. That isn't true. That isn't true. He looks around for inspiration - notices a LONE CLOUD Bob places his fingers on his temples and STARES at the Bill notices and watches, curious.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Oh. Didn't mean to wake you. The two men stare at each other.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	Heard you weren't feeling well? Just tired.
M	LARRY HOOPER	How'd you find us?
M	LYN CASSADY	I told you. I remote viewed you. Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?
M	LYN CASSADY	No.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we were coming over here, asked him if he wanted some work.
M	LYN CASSADY	I haven't seen Scotty.
M	LARRY HOOPER	That's funny, because he told me he'd run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here. (Beat) Isn't that why you came, really, Lyn? You want back in, don't you? Lyn stares at him, disturbed, afraid this might be true.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	It can happen. You've only got to say the word. Could be the new Golden Age for Psi research.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	You, me and Bill, back together again. Just like the old days. Larry closes his eyes, trying to remember something.
M	LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)	Mother Earth, my life support system. As a soldier I must drink your blue water, live inside your red clay and eat your green skin. Lyn listens, moved despite himself.
M	LARRY HOOPER (V.O.)	I pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat.
M	LARRY AND LYN	Carry my body through space and time. You are my connection to the Universe...
M	LARRY AND LYN (V.O.)	...and all that comes after. I am yours and you are mine. As we watch Bill slowly topples forward off the table and
M	LARRY AND LYN	I salute you. Don't make a decision now. Tell me in the morning. He pats Lyn's leg, walks out.
M	BOB	Bill? Bill are you okay? Bill opens his eyes suddenly.
M	BILL DJANGO	I just saw Timothy Leary. Timothy Leary's dead.
M	BILL DJANGO	I know. He's had an idea. Good evening sir. Getting some ice-cream. They walk on and reach the doors to the KITCHENS. The two Then Bob walks in. Bob and Bill sit drinking coffee. Lyn appears with a tray Don't eat the jello. Lyn turns to Bob puzzled. What?
M	BOB	Don't eat the jello. Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry
M	LYN CASSADY	What's going on?
M	BOB	We put LSD in the jello. Lyn turns to stare at him.
M	LYN CASSADY	What?
M	BOB	Bill showed me where Larry had bottles of LSD. So we put it in the jello mix last night. And in the water. Bob turns to stare at him.
M	BOB	What?
M	BILL DJANGO	I put it in the main water tank as well.
M	BOB	But...we've drunk the water. Yeah. He pours himself another coffee.
M	ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.)	The weather? The weather is going Through the window we see Larry get on his belly to get a
M	ARMY BROADCASTER	I'm guessing. I mean, I haven't looked at the, the thing but I'd say it's going to be fucking HOT! Hot. Hot. Hot. The Producer pulls and releases the DJ's headphones so
M	ARMY BROADCASTER (CONT'D)	That hurt Greg, you fucking dip- shit. (Laughing too)You fuckity fuck dip-shit fuck-hole. Music! He hits a button.
M	ALL OVER THE BASE	Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier
M	SOLDIER	You're going to hit the gates. You're going to hit the gates. The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter It's okay. You missed them. Don't you think it might have been more sensible if we hadn't drunk the fucking water?
M	BILL DJANGO	That might have aroused suspicion. But don't worry. Over the years I have built up a massive tolerance to all narcotics.
M	BILL DJANGO	In the name of the New Earth Army and loving people everywhere I'm liberating this base! Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly, Give me the gun Larry. Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses.
M	LARRY HOOPER	Wow. I'm hungry. He wanders off.
M	ARMY DJ (O.S.)	Hey! More music! (muffled) Get off, will ya? Over the loud-speakers we hear the opening of a period
M	LYN CASSADY	Okay, let's go. 174 FLATTENED SECTION OF FENCE 174
M	LYN CASSADY	We're very sorry. Ma'assalama. That's it. Keep going. Ma'assalama. The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand.
M	176 HELICOPTER 176	Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper, Bill at the controls. Bob appears, hurrying over. Wait! Wait for me! Where are you going...what about the mission?
M	LYN CASSADY	You are the mission Bob! You are the mission! Tell them what happened! The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying, The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves
M	BOB (V.O.)	At the time I was hurt that Lyn hadn't taken me with him. But now I know it was because he and Bill had already seen what was to come. Nobody knows exactly what happened. The official story is that their helicopter must have crashed, either because they were hit by an RPG or because...well, that's what happens when you fly a helicopter while you're tripping on acid. All I know is they've never been seen since. Like all Shaman they returned to the sky. The helicopter disappears altogether. When I got back home I wrote the story up. Everything. I sent it to the newspapers, the radio stations, the TV stations, because that was what Lyn wanted me to do. The people needed to know.
M	BOB (V.O.)	I was ready for whatever they would do to me. I was ready to disappear. I was ready to go to prison. I was a Jedi and I was fighting for the New Earth Army.
M	BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	(Beat) But they didn't put me in prison. They did something much worse. And finally, US forces in Iraq are using what some are calling a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and many parents would agree! Some prisoners are being forced to listen to Barney the Purple Dinosaur sing the I Love You song. I think after an hour of that they'll spill the beans! Don't you? Let's go outside to Al for the weather. That was it. That was the only bit of my story that ran anywhere. And it was a joke. And if I ever needed proof of how the Dark Side have taken the beautiful dream of what a nation could be and had twisted it, destroyed it, that was it.
M	BOB'S EDITOR	Bob?
M	BOB (V.O.)	But I won't stop. I won't give up. Bob quickens his pace.
M	BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Because when I look at what is happening in the world, I know that now, more than ever, we need to become ALL that we can BE. Bob is running. Now, more than ever, we need the Supermen. Bob rushes towards the WALL. Just as he is about to hit
