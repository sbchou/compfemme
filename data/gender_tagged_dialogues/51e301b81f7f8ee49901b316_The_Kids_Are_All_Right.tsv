M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	LASER	I don't know, dude.
M	CLAY	B minus in geometry, yo! This shits the bomb!
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Add it up, son. Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line. Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning
F	SASHA	Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week.
M	JAI	Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be...
F	SASHA	Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt. Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with? What? I'm just asking.
M	JAI	Uh, maybe because we're friends...
F	SASHA	Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur. Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches
M	CLAY'S FATHER	Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch. What did I just say?!
M	CLAY	Let me go!
M	CLAY'S FATHER	Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
M	CLAY	Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son,
F	JONI	Laser! Knock it off!
M	LASER	What?! I'm not doing anything. NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a Nic enters. Drops her bag and heads for the table.
F	NIC	Hi guys. Sorry I'm late.
F	JULES	Don't worry. We just started.
F	NIC	27 fibroids. All in the lining.
F	JULES	Honey, that's disgusting. We're eating.
F	JONI	Did you do that laparoscopically?
F	NIC	That's right, Smart Girl. And we got `em all. Hey, whose truck is that?
F	JULES	Mine. NIC Yours?
F	JULES	For the business.
F	NIC	What business?.. The gardening?
F	JONI	Isn't it landscaping. JULES Yes, thank you very much.
F	NIC	Okay... Do we have any Cabarnet left? JULES I didn't look, honey.
M	LASER	Hey, what's up?
F	JULES	Laser, no phone calls at the table.
M	LASER	Lemme hit you back. Who was that?
M	LASER	Nobody. Clay.
F	JULES	Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay?
M	LASER	What do you mean, "get"? Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow?
M	LASER	Mom, you're windshield wiping me.
F	NIC	Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts?
F	JONI	Not yet. But I will...
F	NIC	I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh.
F	JONI	Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.
F	NIC	Great...I mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. You know? Then it's embarrassing.
F	JULES	Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go. Okay, I'll let it go... I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes. I can't believe my baby's 18.
F	JULES	I know...
F	NIC	Big girl. You're a big girl...
F	JONI	Mom... As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.
F	JONI	What? Laser looks nervous.
M	LASER	Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...?
F	JONI	Yeah. I don't want to.
M	LASER	Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind.
F	JONI	I haven't.
M	LASER	How can you not even be curious?
F	JONI	Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now. And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings...
M	LASER	God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it!
F	JONI	Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay? LASER I never ask you for anything.
F	NIC	I just don't understand why you bought the truck now.
F	JULES	Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.
F	NIC	Okay. It just seems a little cart before the horse. JULES What does that mean?
F	NIC	Sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet.
F	JULES	Well you're the one who's always telling me to "act as if!"
F	NIC	That's true. I do. You're right. Look, I'm sorry. It's good you bought the truck. Its proactive. Hey... Wanna watch a movie?
F	JULES	A movie-movie?
F	NIC	Yeah. We haven't done that in a while. cozied up side-by-side facing the TV.
F	NIC	I don't like the guys in this one. They're too shaved.
F	JULES	Don't focus on it. NIC How about the one with the biker gang?
F	JULES	We left it in Hawaii.
F	NIC	I'm cold, honey.
F	JULES	Sorry. I couldn't breathe. Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.
M	MAN IN MOVIE	Suck that fat cock mother-fucker...
F	NIC	Shit!! Where's the remote?!
M	MAN IN MOVIE	I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!... Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the Joni turns to the wall, confused. She hears the porno music Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.
F	NIC	Jesus Christ! Nic flops back, traumatized.
M	NIC (CONT'D)	The whole neighborhood heard that! JULES No, they didn't.
F	NIC	Well, that was a vibe kill. Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches
M	PAUL	How you doing, foxy?
F	TANYA	Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.
M	PAUL	Oh, sorry... TANYA No, I like it. It's earthy.
M	PAUL	What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.
F	TANYA	Gonna be tight. PAUL Really... Hello.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?
M	PAUL	It is. Who's this?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank. PAUL Okay. What can I do for you?
M	WENDY	I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.
M	PAUL	Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then... Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for
M	WENDY	As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent.
M	PAUL	Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy. Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.
M	WENDY (O.S.)	Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her. OMITTED
M	LATER THAT NIGHT	
F	TANYA	You must of figured you'd get a call at some point.
M	PAUL	Not really. I mean I was 19 when I did it. It was so long ago...I just figured no one actually used my stuff. TANYA Why? I'd use it.
M	PAUL	This is so weird. I mean, a part of me's really curious...
F	TANYA	So what are you gonna do? PAUL I don't know. JONI Hello? Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell
M	PAUL	Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.
F	JONI	This is she...
M	PAUL	Hi. This is Paul... Uh, your donor...?
F	JONI	Oh! Hi... PAUL Is this a good time to talk?
F	JONI	Yeah...
F	JULES	Where are you going? It's your turn.
M	PAUL	So... How are you?
F	JONI	I'm good. How are you?
M	PAUL	I'm well, thanks. awkward pause. Paul jumps in to fill the void.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you call-- cuts in, nervous and businesslike.
F	JONI	Actually, my brother asked if I'd call you because I'm 18 and he's only 15 which is too young to call-- anyway, he'd like to meet you...if you want to...
M	PAUL	Your brother?
F	JONI	Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm... PAUL No. I didn't know.
F	JONI	Oh.
M	PAUL	Both of them?
F	JONI	Yeah.
M	PAUL	Like in two? JONI Uh huh. Like in gay.
M	PAUL	Good deal. I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness. Joni doesn't know what to say.
F	JONI	I just don't want you to have big expectations.
M	LASER	Will you quit saying that? I don't have any expectations.
F	JONI	Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm...
M	LASER	Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo! Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance. He nervously Joni and Laser enter the restaurant. They look nervous too.
M	PAUL	Joni. Hey. Nice to meet you.
F	JONI	Paul holds out a hand to Laser.
M	PAUL	And Laser, right? Right.
M	PAUL	Very cool name.
M	LASER	Thanks.
M	PAUL	Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Cool, I got a table set up for us out here...
M	PAUL	Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay? Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want.
M	LASER/JONI	Okay. Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.
M	PAUL	Anything you want to ask me, Laser?
M	LASER	I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions... PAUL That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to? JONI Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall. PAUL Oh yeah? Congratulations.
M	LASER	Joni's the brains in the family. She won a National Merit Scholarship.
M	PAUL	Shut the front door!
M	LASER	Yeah. And she got like an 800 on her Verbal SAT.
F	JONI	Okay, Laser...
M	LASER	What? I'm just saying you're really smart.
F	JONI	No, I just work harder than you. PAUL Don't stress it, Laze. School wasn't my thing either and I turned out okay.
M	LASER	Laser. I'm sorry. Laser. So tell me about you, Laser. What are you into? freezes. So his sister jumps in.
F	JONI	Laser's an amazing athlete. PAUL Oh yeah?
M	LASER	Did you play any sports in school?
M	PAUL	I played a little basketball in junior high.
M	LASER	That's it?
M	PAUL	Pretty much. The whole "team" thing got on my nerves, you know like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass, man!" What about you?
M	LASER	I play some Soccer. Basketball. Baseball. You know, team sports.
M	PAUL	Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in general. Teams are great. I'm just weird like that.
M	LASER	Yeah, I like teams. JONI So this is your place?
M	PAUL	Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. I also have this organic co- op farm down the road. We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant. JONI That's so cool. I'm totally into local.
M	LASER	You are?
F	JONI	Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever.
M	LASER	So, like, do you raise pigs and stuff?
M	PAUL	No. No pigs... But it's a great spot. You guys should come check it out sometime.
F	JONI	Yeah...Definitely...
M	LASER	Is that yours?
M	PAUL	Yeah. You like motorcycles?
M	LASER	Yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle. JONI And by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one.
M	PAUL	That's too bad. They're fun. Well it was great to meet you guys. I hope this was okay.
F	JONI	Yeah...totally...thank you.
M	PAUL	Really nice to meet you, Laser.
M	LASER	Yeah.
F	JONI	I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?...
M	LASER	I guess...
F	JONI	You guess?
M	LASER	Yeah...
F	JONI	God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad!
M	LASER	I know.
F	JONI	Well what did you think of him? LASER I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself.
M	OMITTED	
F	JULES	Hey bug, come here. We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."
M	LASER	I saw it. It was gnarly.
F	NIC	Where are you going?
M	LASER	Clay's.
F	NIC	Don't be back late, okay?
M	LASER	I know.
F	JULES	Can I have a hug before you go?
M	LASER	Mom... JULES Just a quick one. Please!
M	LASER	Hug her. That's what she's there for.
F	NIC	Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already.
F	JULES	What? "Are you and Clay fucking?"
F	NIC	"Exploring" is the word I'd use...
F	JULES	And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care?
F	NIC	We shouldn't... I just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser.
F	JULES	Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions. NIC I feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it.
F	JULES	What are you trying to say?
F	NIC	What do you mean, what am I trying to say?
F	JULES	It feels like there's some subtext here.
F	NIC	What are you talking about?
F	JULES	I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential?" won't go there.
F	NIC	Okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and I have no idea what you're talking about.
F	JULES	Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet.
F	NIC	Yeah. Maybe not.
F	TANYA	So what were they like?
M	PAUL	Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute.
F	TANYA	Sounds like you connected.
M	PAUL	Yeah, we kinda did.
F	TANYA	Where'd you leave it?
M	PAUL	We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a
F	BROOKE	Hey Paul. Paul leans over the basket.
M	PAUL	Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season.
F	BROOKE	Don't they look awesome? I thought you should have the first taste. And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.
F	TANYA	"I thought you should have the first taste...of my pussy."
M	PAUL	Whoa...
M	LASER	Dude, I don't think they smoke pot.
M	CLAY	Hold up. Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Whoa!
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Yo, it's alive!
M	LASER	Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer. Then he
M	CLAY	Dude, we're watching this.
M	CLAY	Think the whole thing's like this?
M	LASER	Want me to fast-forward?
M	OMITTED	Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over JULES Laser, you left your bike out...
F	NIC	Laser, your mom and I accept you and love you unconditionally? You know that, right?
M	LASER	Yeah.
F	NIC	And you know you can be open with us about anything.
M	LASER	Yeah, I know.
F	JULES	Laser, is there anything you want to talk about?
M	LASER	Like what?
F	NIC	Anything. Anything on your mind. Well there is something. It's more of a question, really.
F	NIC	That's okay.
F	JULES	We won't judge you. looks at his moms. Nic and Jules brace themselves.
M	LASER	Why do you guys watch gay man-porn? and Jules look at each other, thrown.
F	NIC	Well, first I have to say we rarely watch that movie-- touches Nic's arm.
F	JULES	Honey... NIC And secondly, I really don't appreciate you snooping around our room. Was that Clay's idea? I have to say again, I don't like him. He seems untended...!
F	JULES	Honey, that's not what he asked--
F	NIC	Fine. Do you want to answer his question?!
F	JULES	Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated. And sometimes, people's desires can be...counter- intuitive... For instance, since women's sexual responsiveness is mostly internal, sometimes it's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more, you know... ...externalized. looks at them, still baffled.
M	JULES (CONT'D)	Like with a penis.
M	LASER	But like, wouldn't you rather watch two women doing it?
F	JULES	You would think that. But in most of those movies, they've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara-- NIC Okay, that's enough! Laser, your mom and I have a sense there's some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in.
M	LASER	What do you mean? JULES Are you having a relationship with someone?
F	NIC	You could tell us, honey. We'd understand and support you.
M	LASER	I just met him once.
F	NIC	What do you mean once?
F	JULES	Did he find you on-line?!
M	LASER	What?! NIC Who did you meet once?
M	LASER	Paul! I met him with Joni. NIC Who's Paul?!
F	JULES	Why was Joni there?!
M	LASER	She set it up. NIC Forget the set-up! Who is Paul?!!
M	LASER	Our sperm donor. Jules and Nic go white. Wait, did you guys think I was gay?! Joni has been pulled into the family conference. Nic and
F	JULES	Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father. That's totally natural.
F	NIC	But why didn't you tell us?
F	JONI	Because we knew you'd be upset.
F	NIC	WE'RE NOT UPSET!! JULES Honey... We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on--
F	JONI	Actually... I want to see him again. JULES LASER You do?! You do?! Yeah. I was gonna tell you.
F	NIC	Whoa! Whoa! No. No way. Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him!
F	NIC	Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know?
F	JULES	Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way.
F	NIC	Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just here!
F	NIC	Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse. JULES I know...
F	NIC	Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed.
F	JULES	I'm with you, honey. We're gonna get through this, okay?
F	NIC	I love you, chicken. JULES I love you too, pony.
M	OMITTED	
F	NIC	Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules.
M	PAUL	Hi, great to meet you two.
F	JULES	I hope the traffic wasn't too bad. PAUL No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through.
F	NIC	Great. Well, come on in.
M	PAUL	This is for you. I don't know if you guys like wine... Nic takes it.
F	NIC	Are you kidding? We love it. And a Petit Syrah. What a treat! Let me get some glasses.
M	PAUL	Beautiful house. How long you guys lived here?
F	JULES	Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long? We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall. Okay.
F	JULES	You okay?
F	NIC	Yeah. Fine.
F	JULES	Go easy on the wine, hon. It's day time.
F	NIC	Okay. And same goes for the micro- managing... Everyone sits at the picnic table.
F	JULES	I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant.
M	PAUL	The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.
F	NIC	So Paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry?
M	PAUL	Well, I always liked food.
F	NIC	No, I was asking because I remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations.
M	PAUL	Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school.
F	JONI	You dropped out of college? PAUL Yeah, it wasn't my thing.
F	NIC	No? Why's that?
M	PAUL	It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't "doing" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	I'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. I mean, college is great for some people. Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love it. That's just me. I'm just weird that way. Which is probably why I ended up in the food-services industry.
M	LASER	See what he did there, mom? You said "food-services industry," then he said "food-services industry..."
F	NIC	Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks. So, Paul, what about your social life?
M	PAUL	My social life?
F	NIC	You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?
F	JONI	Mom!
F	NIC	What? We're getting to know Paul. PAUL No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now. NIC Oh.
M	PAUL	So, how'd you guys meet?
F	NIC	We met at UCLA. I was a resident in the ER and Jules had an emergency. JULES My tongue went numb.
M	PAUL	Really?
F	JULES	Laser, that's not nice.
M	LASER	What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times! PAUL What happened to your tongue?
F	JULES	I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know... PAUL Choke? Die?...
F	JULES	Yeah...exactly...
F	NIC	Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine.
M	PAUL	So what'd you do for her?
F	NIC	Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around.
M	LASER	Mom, that's gross!
F	JULES	Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped.
F	NIC	I was trying to distract you.
F	JULES	I know. And it worked. You were really funny.
F	NIC	You were really pretty.
F	JULES	So that's it. My tongue started working again.
F	NIC	And we've been glued at the hip ever since.
M	PAUL	That's a great story.
F	JULES	We like it. PAUL So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? never likes this question.
F	JULES	Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college...
M	PAUL	Right...
F	JULES	But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born. PAUL Well, that happens...
F	JULES	When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business...
M	PAUL	Right on.
F	JULES	Yeah. But that didn't work out.
M	PAUL	Well, business aren't easy-- JULES Actually, I'm in the process of starting a new business.
M	PAUL	Good for you. What kind? JULES Landscape design... But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean? PAUL Absolutely.
F	NIC	Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about her graduation speech? PAUL No, she didn't.
F	NIC	It was incredible. So full of wisdom and hope... Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love to hear it... JONI No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't...
F	NIC	Sure he would. Come on. Go get it... JONI No, it's okay...
F	NIC	Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.
F	JONI	I'm not embarrassed! Jesus! Give it a rest already!
M	LASER	I'll get the ice-cream. JONI I'll help you.
F	JULES	Honey, that's your forth glass. NIC Actually, it's my third. But thanks for counting. turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood.
M	PAUL	Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it?
F	JULES	Oh, that's okay.
M	PAUL	No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself.
F	JULES	Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it. PAUL Why? I just did. I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay--
F	JULES	No! I am! I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great? My first client."
F	NIC	...I'm just saying, the plan was to limit his involvement--
F	JULES	You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're-- NIC He's not just a client, Jules. He's our sperm donor! Have you ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit Where You Eat?"
F	JULES	Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles. When they rejoin,
F	NIC	I'm sorry. He just seemed sort of...self-satisfied to me.
F	JULES	Yeah, he was working the whole "alternative" thing pretty hard.
F	NIC	"I just need to get outside and `do' things, not sit on my ass and learn. But that's just me. I'm weird that way."
F	JULES	...We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary... ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you... PAUL What do you think?
F	JULES	Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund... PAUL Fecund?
F	JULES	I'm sorry, you know, fertile...
M	PAUL	No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often. More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	What?
F	JULES	Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions... You and Laser have the same mouth.
M	PAUL	You think so?
F	JULES	Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese
F	NIC	What's the score?
F	JULES	Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.
M	LASER	20-3...match point. NIC So how'd it go today?
F	JULES	Great. We settled on a concept.
F	NIC	What is it?
F	JULES	It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it.
F	NIC	Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card? Laser! What do I have to do?! I bought you a card. I left it on your desk. All you had to do was--
M	LASER	Mom, settle! I will...
F	NIC	Don't tell me to settle, mister. And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday.
M	LASER	Whatever, I have other plans anyway.
F	NIC	What other plans? I'm asking you a quest--
M	LASER	I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He
F	NIC	You used to be so cute! We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something. Laser
M	PAUL	This may not be a good idea. Are you filming?!
M	PAUL	He's not gonna make it. Clay, you're not gonna make it!
M	LASER	I think he may be right, dude. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. CLAY Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame! Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, PAUL/LASER ARE YOU OKAY?!
M	CLAY	Did you get that?!
M	LASER	Seriously, dude, are you okay?
M	CLAY	I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you fucking get it?!
M	PAUL	Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me.
M	LASER	Clay's cool. He's just gets a little amped sometimes.
M	PAUL	That's not amped. That's being a dick.
M	LASER	He's not a dick, that's just his way. PAUL Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you.
M	LASER	Well, you don't know him.
M	PAUL	You're right...I don't...
M	LASER	Hey, can I ask you a question?
M	PAUL	Sure.
M	LASER	Why'd you donate sperm? PAUL Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. doesn't laugh. Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a I don't know, I guess I thought, you know, if I can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby...
M	LASER	So you did it to help people?
M	PAUL	It was a long time ago...
M	LASER	How much did you get paid?
M	PAUL	Why do you want to know?
M	LASER	I'm just curious. PAUL I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.
M	LASER	That's it?
M	PAUL	It was worth more back then. You know. With inflation... Hey, I'm glad I did it...
F	SASHA	Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox. JAI Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty?
F	SASHA	I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single?
F	JONI	Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice.
F	SASHA	Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters...
F	JONI	You want to keep playing?
M	JAI	Sure.
M	JAI (CONT'D)	Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha, you know... JONI Yeah...
M	JAI	It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad... That stops Joni in her tracks.
F	JONI	Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it. Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at
F	JULES	Wow. What's this?
F	NIC	Come here. Sit down.
M	NIC (CONT'D)	I'm sorry I've been such a bitch lately. I know I'm not being my highest self.
F	JULES	Yeah, well...
F	NIC	You've been really patient with me. I just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized.
M	NIC (CONT'D)	Get in.
F	JULES	Oh god, chicken, that's the spot. NIC How's the water?
F	JULES	Perfect. You wanna come in?
F	NIC	In a bit. You enjoy it first. Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.
F	JULES	No, don't stop...
F	NIC	No, I meant to put `em in.... Don't move...
F	JULES	Nic?!!
F	NIC	No, we're planning on being here through mid-August so... No, I promise, I'm not going anywhere.
M	OMITTED.	JULES Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you're signed off on the Bougainvillea...
M	JULES (CONT'D)	What's that?
M	PAUL	Strawberry rhubarb pie. Fresh from my garden.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Good, huh?
F	JULES	Oh my god. That is criminal. PAUL Have more.
F	JULES	No, please, just take it away... PAUL You had one bite.
F	JULES	I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up.
M	PAUL	Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.
F	JULES	So...you're good with the plants? Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you--
M	PAUL	No, I'm just thinking. Hang on. Yeah, I'm good with the plants.
F	JULES	Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism.
M	PAUL	I wasn't criticizing you.
F	JULES	No, I know...I just... Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist.
M	PAUL	That doesn't mean you have to be negative.
M	LUIS (O.S.)	Excuse me, Senora? Hello? What's up?
M	LUIS	5 o'clock. JULES Yeah. Okay.
M	LUIS	Same time tomorrow?
F	JULES	Yes! Same time!
M	JULES (CONT'D)	Okay. I'm gonna take off too...
M	PAUL	Same time tomorrow? pushes Paul, laughing.
F	JULES	That's mean.
M	PAUL	Here, take this...
F	JULES	No!
M	PAUL	Just give it to the kids.
F	JULES	Okay! God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I don't know where that came from... PAUL It's okay...
F	JULES	Okay. I'm gonna go now...
M	PAUL	Jules...?
F	JULES	...but I shall return! Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie. Paul watches NIC So how'd it go with Paul?
F	JULES	What do you mean?
F	NIC	I don't know. Did you break ground? Did you dig in? I don't know the terms.
F	JULES	No, we just talked...conceptually.
F	NIC	Oh, so it was less of a "doing" day, huh? Was he okay with that?
F	JULES	You know, maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little. NIC Okay. You're right.
F	JULES	And I also think we should start composting.
M	OMITTED	Sweating and dirty, Joni and Paul pull radishes from the
M	PAUL	You got your mom's fair skin. You didn't get my Mediterranean genes...
F	JONI	Thanks...
M	JONI (CONT'D)	Ugh. Ignore.
M	PAUL	Who's that?
F	JONI	My mom, Nic. She's making me insane.
M	PAUL	Why? What's she doing?
F	JONI	She's treating me like I'm 12. It's like she doesn't want to admit I'm an adult.
M	PAUL	She's your mom. That's her job.
F	JONI	What? To smother me to death? That's not her job.
M	PAUL	Well, if you want things to be different, you've got to make that happen. That's your job. Laser walks with Clay. Clay sports a homemade arm-cast for
M	CLAY	That jump was cake, dude! I so could've made it.
M	LASER	You were like 20 feet short, dude! There was no way.
M	CLAY	Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there I could have landed it. That guy creeps me out.
M	LASER	Whatever.
M	CLAY	He's kind of a fag, dude. Tryin' to act all like your dad and shit.
M	LASER	Hey buddy. Good boy.
M	LASER (CONT'D)	I've seen this dog around. I wonder if he's lost.
M	CLAY	Let's pee on his head.
M	LASER	What? unzips his fly. It's difficult with the plaster cast.
M	LASER (CONT'D)	Dude, don't do that. CLAY Come on. Hold him...
M	LASER	Dude, Quit it!
M	CLAY	Duuude, quit it!
M	LASER	Go! Run! Get out of here!
M	CLAY	Why are you such a fag?!
M	LASER	Why are you such a dick?!
M	PAUL	Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the Paul takes Joni home on his motorcycle via Sunset Boulevard. The ladies sit in the living room watching TV.
F	JULES	Relax. She'll get home when she gets home.
F	NIC	Quit telling me to relax! They go back to watching TV. After a beat, we HEAR a What the fuck...!
F	NIC	Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle!
F	JONI	Mom...
F	NIC	You know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?!
M	PAUL	I'm a very safe rider...
F	NIC	That is so not the point I'm making! Joni knows this is something I'd never allow.
F	JONI	Mom, I'm 18 years old! I won't even be living here in like next month!
F	NIC	Yeah, well, you're living here now! JONI Yeah, well why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like I'm not!
F	NIC	She's never talked to me like that.
M	PAUL	You know, Nic. If you eased up on the restrictions, maybe there'd be less tension... NIC Really? You think so, Paul? Is that how it works? walks up to intervene.
F	JULES	What's going on?
F	NIC	Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons.
M	PAUL	I was just saying--
F	NIC	Listen, when you've been a parent for 18 years, come talk to me! PAUL I was just making an observation.
F	NIC	Yeah, and I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!
M	OMITTED	
F	NIC	Joni? I was just upset. You know how I feel about motorcycles. Joni opens the door.
F	JONI	I know how you feel about them. But I'm an adult now and you have to respect that. Goodnight.
M	OMITTED	CLOSE ON Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans. Luis walks
F	JULES	Paul?
M	PAUL	Hey. What's up?
F	JULES	Look, I'm sorry about last night. I'm really embarrassed.
M	PAUL	Don't be. She's the one who wigged out.
F	JULES	I know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now... PAUL Jules, it's okay. You don't have to defend her.
F	JULES	And look, I just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something I...do.
M	PAUL	Yeah, I sensed that.
F	JULES	I just wanted to clear the air.
M	PAUL	The air is clear.
F	JULES	Paul, I can't!
M	PAUL	You don't want to?!
F	JULES	No, I do! It's just... I have a guy outside!
F	JULES	Oh. Well. Hel-lo! PAUL What?
F	JULES	Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some
M	LUIS (O.S.)	Hello? Excuse me, Senora Allgood?! They stop mid-thrust.
F	JULES	You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously. Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door.
F	JULES	What's up?
M	LUIS	Where do you want the stones?
F	JULES	The stones? Over by the fence.
M	JULES (CONT'D)	What? I was using the bathroom. Do you need to use the bathroom?
M	LASER	That's H. PAUL I know.
M	LASER	Lay-up.
M	PAUL	Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning-- Nobody likes a show-off.
M	LASER	Hey, can I ask you a question?
M	PAUL	Oh god. Okay. Hit me.
M	LASER	When you die do you want to be buried or cremated?
M	PAUL	That's your question?
M	LASER	I want to be cremated.
M	PAUL	I think I'd rather be buried.
M	LASER	Why? That's just taking up more space in the earth.
M	PAUL	I don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled--
M	LASER	What do you care? You won't even be conscious.
M	PAUL	That's true. I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me.
M	LASER	But why?! You'll be dead! You won't even know they're there! Joni and Sasha are at a table eating dinner. Tanya has
F	SASHA	God, I love your necklace! Where'd you get it?
F	TANYA	I don't know, some flea market--
F	SASHA	In Africa?
F	TANYA	No, more like Pasadena.
F	SASHA	Well, it's really awesome. saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha. He PAUL Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya back now. clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking
F	SASHA	That's okay, Paul.
F	TANYA	Well ladies, it was fun talking with you. SASHA/JONI You too.
F	SASHA	Okay, I'm sorry but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe. JONI No he's not. He wouldn't do that.
F	SASHA	Why not? He's not my dad.
F	JONI	God Sasha, that's totally gross! Not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay? Especially when you act like a slut.
F	SASHA	Fuck you.
F	JONI	Well it makes you seem insecure and desperate.
F	SASHA	I'm not insecure and desperate! I'm just a normal sexual person! And maybe you'd get that if you weren't so uptight!
F	JONI	Fuck you. I'm not uptight! Nic and Jules dine with their friends, JOEL and STELLA.
F	STELLA	Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes are insane.
F	JULES	Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day. They were huge!
M	JOEL	So, the kids have been spending time with him?
F	NIC	Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together.
F	STELLA	Well, it's great they like him so much. You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm.
M	NIC (CONT'D)	Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet? gives Nic a look. Joel and Stella feel the tension
F	STELLA	Hey, have you guys tried those Açai fruit packs?
F	JULES	No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods.
F	STELLA	I know. Joel's addicted.
M	JOEL	What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational. NIC Oh, just fucking kill me...
F	JULES	Honey...
F	NIC	I'm sorry guys, but I just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes. "Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves." God! What a bunch of bullshit!
F	JULES	How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table. Explodes.
F	NIC	You know what, Jules?! I like my wine! Okay? So fucking sue me! And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan!
F	JULES	Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day!
F	NIC	Fuck you. Nic storms off. Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen.
F	JULES	I'm sorry.
F	JULES	What the hell is going on with you?
F	NIC	This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy! I feel like he's taking over my family.
F	JULES	No. He's not!
F	NIC	Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just exhausted...
F	JULES	Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge.
F	NIC	Sure, and who's gonna pay for that? looks pissed off, and hurt.
M	NIC (CONT'D)	Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here.
F	JULES	Because that's the way you like it! That's the way you keep control!
F	NIC	What are you talking about?
F	JULES	Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife!
F	NIC	That is just not true!
F	JULES	You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career!
F	NIC	What are you talking about? I just helped you start another business!
F	JULES	Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself!
F	NIC	No, so you can feel better about yourself!
F	JULES	Are you even attracted to me anymore?
M	BARTENDER	Do you still want this?
F	NIC	No. Just the check please.
M	JULES AND PAUL	
F	JULES	God, I feel so drugular right now. I really want a cigarette! Do you have any? I haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born. Do you smoke?
M	PAUL	Sometimes. But I don't have any here. Want me to run to the store?
F	JULES	Yeah. Wait, no. Don't. Sorry. Do you think I'm just like some sad- sack middle-aged lesbian?
M	PAUL	God, that's it. I was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends. Thank you.
F	JULES	You want to get that?
M	PAUL	No. I want to get this... Hi Paul. It's Joni. I just wanted to apologize for my friend, Sasha. I was really embarrassed when she put her hand on your-- PAUL Hey, Joni. I'm here... Listen, don't worry about your friend. Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!" Paul No. Honestly. I didn't even notice...
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Hey, Joni? Can you hold on a second?
M	MOMENTS LATER - JULES	
F	JULES	Did you go to Home Depot? LUIS Yeah. I just got back.
F	JULES	That was fast!
M	LUIS	Yeah, no lines.
F	JULES	What's that look?
M	LUIS	What look?
F	JULES	The look you're giving me right now! LUIS That's no look. That just my face.
F	JULES	Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself!
M	LUIS	Senora, I didn't give no looks!
F	JULES	I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business...
M	LUIS	I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies! JULES Then why are you a gardener?!
M	LUIS	Cause I love the flowers.
F	JULES	Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done. The family sits in silence, having breakfast. Nic looks
F	NIC	Look, I know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul. And I know I haven't been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused some...friction...between us. But I'd like to try and change that... Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted. "And...?"
M	NIC (CONT'D)	So I was thinking. Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime. That way, I could get to know him a little better, and I could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard. Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods. They
M	OMITTED	
M	PAUL	How's it going? JULES Okay...
M	PAUL	Here, let me help.
F	JULES	We can't be doing this...
M	PAUL	I know...
F	JULES	I'm married... PAUL ...and the kids...
F	JULES	Yeah, and I love Nic.
M	PAUL	I know... They stare at each other and we cut to... Paul and Jules lie in bed. Jules looks nauseated. Paul
M	PAUL	I got you some cigarettes.
F	JULES	Jesus, what's wrong with me? I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was totally wrong...
M	PAUL	Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Things get messy sometimes...
F	JULES	That wasn't messy. That was fucked up. I'm totally fucked up...
M	PAUL	I think I'm really falling for you.
F	JULES	Paul, don't... Jules takes a shower, washing off the evidence. She looks
F	TANYA	Pretty good night. That table had like 5 bottles of wine. PAUL Wow. Yeah. Good night.
F	TANYA	Joni's pretty. She's got some of your genes.
M	PAUL	I think she looks more like her mom actually. But thank you.
F	TANYA	It's cute seeing you in dad mode. PAUL Yeah?
F	TANYA	Yeah. It makes me want to fuck you.
M	PAUL	Oh yeah?...
F	TANYA	Yeah... Tanya moves imperceptibly closer.
M	TANYA (CONT'D)	I've been missing our sleep-overs.
M	PAUL	Yeah, it's been a while.
F	TANYA	You want to meet up later?
M	PAUL	Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I don't think we should do that anymore.
F	TANYA	What happened?
M	PAUL	You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still "hanging out." You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her. Tanya gets it.
F	TANYA	Oh. Fuck you.
F	JULES	I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare...
F	NIC	It looks great, honey. Very indigenous. I'm so proud of you. Hey, so how's that guy Luis working out?
F	JULES	Oh, I had to fire him.
F	NIC	Really?! JULES Yeah, he had a drug problem.
F	NIC	Whoa. What kind of drugs?
F	JULES	Blow, I think...
M	PAUL	Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle.
F	NIC	You know what, I think I'm gonna stick with water tonight. But thank you so much. Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first.
M	NIC (CONT'D)	God, Paul, this steak is delicious. What's the seasoning?
M	PAUL	I just mist it with a little truffle oil.
F	NIC	What a good idea. We should try that. Right, honey?
F	JULES	Mmm-hmmm.
F	NIC	And it's done to perfection.
M	PAUL	So it's not too rare? NIC No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be.
M	PAUL	Good. A lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red. NIC Ugh, isn't that annoying? That happens to me all the time when I'm grilling.
M	PAUL	Don't people know that rare means red? NIC Right?! It means bloody!
M	PAUL	Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in. Joni tries
F	JONI	I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be--
F	NIC	...So Paul, I was checking out your album collection over there. Quite the eclectic mix...
M	PAUL	Thanks...
F	NIC	You don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell. glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.
M	PAUL	Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan?
F	NIC	Not really. We just named our daughter after her. PAUL Cool. Right on...
F	NIC	What's your favorite Joni album?
M	PAUL	I think I have to go with "Blue." raises her hand in a testify. Yeah? You too?
F	NIC	Oh God, I probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album. That record kills me.
M	PAUL	I know, it never lets up, you got "River," "California..."
F	NIC	"A Case of You..." PAUL "All I Want.."
F	NIC	Mmm!! I am on a lonely road and I am traveling traveling, traveling, traveling/Looking for something, what can it be/Oh I hate you some, I hate you some/I love you some Oh I love you/when I forget about me...
M	NIC (CONT'D)	I want to talk to you/I want to shampoo you/I want to renew you again and again/Applause, applause/ Life is our cause/When I think of your kisses/My mind see-saws... Do you see/do you see/do you see how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt you too/then we both get/soo-ooo- ooo blue...
M	LASER	Don't quit your day job, mom.
M	PAUL	Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder. You're right. I'm sorry, mom. looks at Paul. Stunned. Then looks at Jules and points
F	NIC	I like this guy.
M	PAUL	You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M.
F	JONI	It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up.
M	PAUL	I think it's cool.
F	NIC	Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom?
M	PAUL	Just around there.
F	NIC	You know what? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle. Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- Nic skulks out of the bathroom. She looks out and b-lines Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed. Her look tells us she's Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained.
M	NIC'S POV:	Paul and Jules talking comfortably. Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions. Jules is
F	JULES	Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters...
F	NIC	You're sleeping with him, aren't you.
F	JULES	What?
F	NIC	Just be honest with me. Don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now!
F	JULES	Where is this coming from?!
F	NIC	I found your hair in his drain! JULES What? I was working. I got dirty so I took a shower. NIC Oh yeah? You take a nap, too?
F	NIC	Are you in love with him?!
F	JULES	No! What, are you straight now?!
F	JULES	No. It has nothing to do with that! I've just felt so cut off from you lately... NIC Oh, right, so it's my fault!
F	JULES	No! Who said anything about fault? Just listen to me!
F	NIC	I'm listening! What?! I just needed... NIC What? To be fucked?
F	JULES	No, appreciated!
F	NIC	It's always what I'm not doing for you, isn't it? Well here's what I don't to you. I don't work out my issues by fucking other people!
F	JULES	He's not just "other people!"
F	NIC	No, you had to go fuck our sperm donor! You couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me...
F	JULES	Where are you going?! NIC I need water! My mouth is dry! Jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the
F	JULES	Hey Laser. Honey?
M	LASER	What?
F	JULES	Listen, I know you and Joni heard what's going on. I just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over. There's nothing going on now. Okay.
F	JULES	I know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you want to talk about anything. Is there anything you want to talk about?
M	LASER	Not really.
F	JULES	Okay then. Go back to sleep.
F	JULES	Joni?
F	JONI	I don't want to talk to you.
F	JULES	Can we just--
F	JONI	I said I don't want to talk to you!!
F	JULES	Okay. I'm sorry. SASHA How's Nic doing?
F	JONI	She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before. SASHA Is it him...? JONI Hello.
M	PAUL	Hey Joni, how you doing?
F	JONI	You're such a phony.
M	PAUL	Excuse me?
F	JONI	You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person!
M	PAUL	What happened? JONI With my mom?!
M	PAUL	Listen, can I just come and talk with you--
F	JONI	What's wrong with you?! PAUL Joni...
F	JONI	Don't call me anymore. Joni hangs up and start crying. Sasha hugs her. Sweaty, nauseous with remorse, Paul turns around to find BROOKE Hey Paul, look at these cukes... Jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette. Her cell
M	PAUL	Hey, it's me. I just talked to Joni. Conversation intercut.
F	JULES	Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette.
M	PAUL	What happened? JULES Nic saw my hair in your bathroom.
M	PAUL	The other night.
F	JULES	Yeah. PAUL Fuck...
F	JULES	Yeah. Beat.
M	PAUL	Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen.
F	JULES	Paul...
M	PAUL	No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing.
F	JULES	Paul, come on...
M	PAUL	No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready--
F	JULES	Jesus, Paul! I'm gay! SASHA Slow down, tiger.
F	JONI	I like the scruff. It's sexy.
M	WAIFY GIRL	Uh, `scuuuse me...
F	JONI	You're excused. Hey, can I talk to you?
M	JAI	Joni...Joni...
F	JONI	What?
M	JAI	Are you okay?
F	JONI	Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her
F	JULES	Just getting another pillow. The couch is kind of saggy.
F	NIC	Is your back okay? Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again?
F	JULES	It's a little ache-y.
F	NIC	You should take some Advil.
M	Guess not.	Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs.
F	JULES	Hey. How was the party?
F	JONI	Fine.
F	JULES	How big was it? JONI I don't know. Medium...ish...
F	JULES	Are you drunk?
F	JONI	No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece.
F	NIC	I hope you had a designated driver.
F	JONI	Why? I'm not drunk.
F	NIC	Well, you seem drunk to me.
F	JONI	Yeah, well, you should know. NIC What did you just say to me?!
F	JONI	I'm going to bed.
F	NIC	No, you're not! I'm not done talking to you!
F	JONI	What do you want from me?! I did everything you wanted! I got all A's! I got in everywhere I applied! Now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have! JULES Don't talk to your mom like that! Joni spins to face Jules.
F	JONI	You're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?!
F	JULES	Hey, I'm still your mother. JONI Whatever... Don't touch me! I'm so sick of both of you! The sun rises on this formerly happy home. Jules wakes up on the couch. Sits up. Rubs her aching back. Joni packs for college. The room is littered with half-
F	NIC	Did you pack that lamp I gave you?
F	JONI	Yeah. NIC Well, we can always get stuff up there, too, if you need it, I mean if the room's dark or you need extra bedding...
F	JONI	I'm not going to Siberia, mom.
F	JULES	I can't believe this is our last dinner together.
M	LASER	Oh God, are you gonna cry?
F	JULES	I wish you were gay. You'd be so much more sensitive. It's probably Sasha. I'll get it. What are you doing here? I needed to talk to you before you left. There's nothing to talk about.
M	PAUL	I just want to apologize again for what happened. I can't tell you how much I regret it.
F	JONI	So like, everything that happened between us. What was that? Was that just bullshit?! PAUL No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I know I don't seem credible right now but I really care about you... Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	...and I just hope someday we'll be able to see each other again. Do you think that could maybe happen?
F	JONI	I don't know... Joni looks down welling up. I just wish you could've been... PAUL What? JONI Better...
F	NIC	You've got some balls, mister!
M	PAUL	Nic, hold on...
F	NIC	No, you hold on! Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids! PAUL Well, they're kinda my...
F	NIC	No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper... Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.
M	PAUL	I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.
F	NIC	If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own! Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.
F	JULES	I need to say something.
M	JULES (CONT'D)	Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring. Jules soldiers on.
M	JULES (CONT'D)	So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would... Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually. Thank you. The Allgoods are on the road, heading to college. The station wagon passes through the campus. As they drive past buildings and dorms, Joni sees STUDENTS Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni Nic and Jules follow Joni to the door. They all jam up at
F	JONI	Guys, it's okay. I got it. JONI Where'd you go?!
F	NIC	We had to move the car.
F	JONI	I thought you left.
F	JULES	We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
F	NIC	Give us some credit.
M	LASER	It's gonna be weird not having you at home.
F	JONI	Sorry to leave you alone with them.
M	LASER	It's okay. I can handle it. Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni,
F	JONI	Guys, come on... Look, I'll talk to you soon. They keep holding her until a calm sets in. Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the
M	LASER	I don't think you guys should break up. A long beat.
F	NIC	No? Why's that?
M	LASER	I think you're too old.
F	NIC	Thanks, Laser.
