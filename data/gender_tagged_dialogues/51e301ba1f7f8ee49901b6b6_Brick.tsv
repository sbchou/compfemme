M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	A WRIST WATCH	12:43. Brendan looks up from the watch. the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel. The street names were changed in production to match existing streets (we couldn't
M	VOICE	Brendan?
M	BRENDAN	Emily?
F	EMILY	Yeah. How's things?
M	BRENDAN	Status quo.
F	EMILY	Yeah?
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh.
F	EMILY	That's good.
M	BRENDAN	What's going on, Em?
F	EMILY	It's good to see you, Brendan. It's been some time.
M	BRENDAN	Two months.
F	EMILY	Yeah. I didn't even know your locker. I had to ask Brain.
M	BRENDAN	Em, why don't we meet somewhere?
F	EMILY	I can't. Why not?
F	EMILY	I screwed up real bad. I really screwed up.
M	BRENDAN	Screwed up how?
F	EMILY	I did what she said with the brick, I didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on it now for poor Frisco and they're playing it all on me-
M	BRENDAN	Slow down now, what?
F	EMILY	You gotta help me Brendan I think tug- Oh! of the booth. window.1 A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter. Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the
M	BRENDAN	Brain.
M	THE BRAIN	Hey Brendan. It's been awhile. Where you been eating?
M	BRENDAN	Back of school.
M	THE BRAIN	Huh. Yeah, no one's seen you. What's it been, a couple months?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah, it's been awhile. You gave Emily my locker number?
M	THE BRAIN	A few days ago. Was I wrong?
M	BRENDAN	What?
M	THE BRAIN	To give it?
M	BRENDAN	No.
M	THE BRAIN	It's been so long, I don't know you two's stats.
M	BRENDAN	It has been awhile. Who's she been eating with? THE BRAIN I dunno. It's hard to keep track.
M	BRENDAN	Is it?
M	THE BRAIN	Can be.
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh.
M	THE BRAIN	She hasn't been doing too good.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah well. I'm not looking for a patch up. Em's life is her own. But she asked for my help.
M	THE BRAIN	Help with what?
M	BRENDAN	I don't know. I don't even care, it's not my business. I just want to know she's ok, so I've got to find her. That's all this is.
M	THE BRAIN	Well. I know she was poking in with the Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura Dannon's crowd.
M	BRENDAN	Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on the upper crust.
M	BRENDAN	He's a sap.
M	THE BRAIN	Know him?
M	BRENDAN	By sight.
M	THE BRAIN	I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged after them for a bit, but it didn't work. So she picked her way down the food chain. Last I seen she was with whasshername, that drama vamp. Small time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one you dated-
M	BRENDAN	Kara.
M	THE BRAIN	That's my bus.
M	BRENDAN	You know her locker number?
M	THE BRAIN	Kara's?
M	BRENDAN	Em's.
M	THE BRAIN	
M	BRENDAN	Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find me if she shows.
M	THE BRAIN	Sure. him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at a party, drinks in hand. Sixth period has broke. Masses of students pile into busses.
M	GIRL	Hello, Brendan.
M	BRENDAN	Kara.
F	KARA	Come to see the show? Kisses the freshman's forehead, purring.
M	BRENDAN	No, I didn't. Lapdog, blow.
F	KARA	Stay. Don't be mean.
M	BRENDAN	I'm all friendly. Watch your head, kid - that thing bites. I need words.
F	KARA	I'm listening.
M	BRENDAN	About Emily Kostich.
F	KARA	Get me my purse. Hurry!
M	BRENDAN	Still picking your teeth with freshmen?
F	KARA	You were a freshman once.
M	BRENDAN	Way once, sister. You and Em were tight for a bit. Who's she eating with now?
F	KARA	Eating with?
M	BRENDAN	Eating with. Lunch. Who.
F	KARA	You're a cutie.
M	BRENDAN	You gonna tell me?
F	KARA	Guess you're up from the underneath then. The whole Jerr thing blown over. Lucky strikes, you and your partner get bulled, you come up clean. But I guess you were always the brains of the outfit.1 One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory, most of which were Where's Emily?
F	KARA	Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you.
M	BRENDAN	God.
F	KARA	I don't know where she's at, Brendan.
M	BRENDAN	I know you do, so why don't you want me to find her?
F	KARA	Maybe I'm looking out for you.
M	BRENDAN	Well I appreciate that.
F	KARA	Brendan... you looking to get back into things? I could use you. pockets... nothing. He stops. A red edge behind one of the photos - the same red card with a mask on it, but whole. Across the bottom in small print: "Halloween in January - Call for DETAILS - 555-2394" Hello?
M	BRENDAN	Hello, ma'am, this is Tom, I'm a friend from school. Could I speak to...
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Oh, hi Tom. Laura's here, hold on.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	Yes?
M	BRENDAN	I'm calling for details.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	For what?
M	BRENDAN	Details about the party.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	Who is this?
M	BRENDAN	I don't think we've met.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	Well then I don't think you're invited to my party. It's a rather exclusive gathering.
M	BRENDAN	I can imagine. You should really work on your invite management. That might be a personal 'room for improvement' area in your life. But discretion of your invite sending aside, I have procured a certain someone's invitation, and would like details. A beat of silence. You think you're cute, whoever you are.
M	BRENDAN	Wait'll you get a load of my felt fedora and spats.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	Who are you? Or I'll hang up.
M	BRENDAN	You don't know me - I'll save you some time.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	I know everyone and I've got all the time in the world.
M	BRENDAN	Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation I've got.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	What you said.
M	BRENDAN	Emily Kostich.
M	LAURA'S VOICE	15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove. Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o'clock. But who- says 4:53. The desk is empty, Tetris paused. A shower runs behind an ajar door in the background. directory: "42 -- DANNON" he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd stares, but no one stops him.
M	BRAD	If the coach wants to play me I'll play, but I can't put my best game in if I've got to worry about whether I'm going to be in there. Halftime last game, coach is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out on the field he says to me 'you gotta think about the team and you gotta' you know and 'if you run that ball again you're out', and I said to him you gotta let me play! I'm out there, let me play, and he's saying 'no you're out' and I kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!', just right in his face-
M	BIFF	He was!
M	BRAD	Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play! Let me play! Let me play!' the room, straight into Brendan. He wags his eyebrows at her.
M	BRENDAN	Tom!
M	BRENDAN (cont'd)	Could you step aside, please? I'm trying to follow Brad's story, and it's difficult when I can't see his face. dopey grin and tips his glass.
M	BRAD	He doesn't give me a play to make, what can I do, you know? and she wags her eyebrows once at him. amused at all. Hey. Hey! What are you doing here?
M	BRENDAN	Leaving.
M	BRAD	Oh yeah?
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh. Unless your anecdote's got a 2nd act.
M	BRAD	Why don't you leave?
M	BRENDAN	That's what I was doing.
F	LAURA	Whiskey? Jameson.
F	LAURA	I like a man who knows what he's drinking.
M	BRENDAN	That's a pretty sick thing to be attracted to.
F	LAURA	Brad's not a good guy to get on the wrong side of.
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh.
F	LAURA	Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix me one.
F	LAURA	I'll never get through all this.
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh.
F	LAURA	I knew your old partner Jerr since grade school. Tough break. How long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting?
M	BRENDAN	A few months. Could have helped himself out by turning me in, but he took the heat. He was a good guy. Solid.
F	LAURA	Was he?
M	BRENDAN	You knew him.
F	LAURA	Yeah I did. So why are you here tonight?
M	BRENDAN	I'm looking for Emily.
F	LAURA	She wasn't invited.
M	BRENDAN	She had an invitation.
F	LAURA	Well like you said, I've got to work on that. Em's been AWOL for a good month, nobody's seen her.
M	BRENDAN	I saw her yesterday.
F	LAURA	Nearly nobody's seen her. So what did she tell you?
M	BRENDAN	Score 0 for finesse.
F	LAURA	Listen, you're scratching at the wrong door. I wasn't with Emily enough to know details of what she was in, I just got wind of the downfall, and I didn't get any details of that, except that it was bad. So now that we're showing some cards...
M	BRENDAN	If you haven't got a finger in Em's troubles, why'd her name get me into your rather exclusive party? Keep up with me now. I don't know, but it sounded like you did, and a body's got a right to be curious. Now I'm not so sure.
M	BRENDAN	Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me. I just want to find her.
F	LAURA	Coffee and pie.
M	BRENDAN	Coffee and pie oh my?
F	LAURA	And you didn't hear it from me. turns back to Brendan. Will you wait here for me?
M	BRENDAN	Sure.
F	LAURA	You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll be five minutes.
M	BRENDAN	Yes. begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun. black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly. The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. Laura
M	BRENDAN	Where's Dode?
M	STONER 1	Dunno, bra.
M	BRENDAN	Dode?
M	STONER 2	Uh uh.
M	DODE	Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn't be here. lips, muffled intelligence. Kara told me you know where Em's at.
M	DODE	Uh huh. And why are you looking for Em?
M	BRENDAN	She asked for my help.
M	DODE	Uh huh. Listen man, I've got plenty on my plate without dealing with some jilted ex.
M	BRENDAN	It's not about that.
M	DODE	Whatever it's about, act smarter than you look and drop it.
M	BRENDAN	Where is she?
M	DODE	She's with me, and right now that's the best place for her. Leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle.
M	BRENDAN	You're on the bright side of dim, Dode, but if I thought you had this half- handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's she at?
M	DODE	Better get while it's good. Heel it now, dig? dumpster. Back off.
M	BRENDAN	Throw one at me if you want, hash head. I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you.
M	BIG STONER	Just easy-
M	BRENDAN	Where's Em?
M	DODE	She's with me. She was tight when she called you, man. Came to and freaked. She told me to shake you if you came by. Said you'd only make things worse.
M	STONER 1 (O.S.)	Put him down, man!
M	DODE	Deal with whatever this ain't about and drop it.
M	BIG STONER	Nothing more here, bra.
M	BRENDAN	Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her if she still wants my help or not that's her business, but I want to hear it straight from her.
M	DODE	She don't -
M	BRENDAN	Today. She knows where I eat lunch. When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction
M	BIG STONER	And stay out, punk! girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets
F	EMILY	I must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone. Yesterday.
M	EMILY (cont'd)	It was dumb, I got paranoid over a really stupid thing. I was high, I went crazy for a little bit, but now you have to forget about it. Please. That's how you can help me now, forget about it.
M	EMILY (cont'd)	Brendan, I know you're mad at all these people, cause you think I went away from you and went to them. But you've got to start seeing it as my decision, stop being angry because where I want to be at's different from where you wanna be at.
M	BRENDAN	Who fed you that line, Em?
F	EMILY	And stop picking on Dode. He's a good guy.
M	BRENDAN	The Carrows rat? He's a good friend.
M	BRENDAN	So what am I?
F	EMILY	Yeah, what are you? Eating back here, not liking anybody, how are you judging anyone? I loved you alot but I couldn't stand it, I had to get with people. I couldn't heckle life with you, I had to see what was what. I'm sorry Brendan.
M	BRENDAN	You've got to come back to me, Em.
F	EMILY	No. No. Never. I'm sorry. Never. I can't love on your terms, Brendan. I can't do that, I'm not like you.
M	BRENDAN	You're in a spot, I can get you out of it. Come back to me, and whatever heat follows you I'll deal with.
F	EMILY	No. You're not hearing me, no. I don't want to be put away and protected. No. No.
M	BRENDAN	Tell me about the trouble, the brick and the pin -
F	EMILY	You gonna fix things like you did with Jerr? No. I came to say goodbye, for good. Whatever you have to do to let me go, do it. I'm gonna let you go, I've decided that. Make sure that, you've got to, promise you won't torture yourself, that you'll let me go. Let me go. head in "Lord of the Flies".1 THE ADDRESS BOOK paper which looks like this:
M	THE BRAIN	Hm. Do you know anything else about this? Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us Mm.
M	THE BRAIN	Slim pickings. Why'd you let Dode fly when he came back to whose-her-name, at the theater?
M	BRENDAN	Kara. It's their turf, I couldn't hear them without being seen, and that would only biff their play. Best to know it's there, let it ride and see what comes of it. But anyway.
M	THE BRAIN	Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is, it didn't come straight from Dode, less he's playing out of his league. I can only give you my best guess.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	THE BRAIN	they do them in different spots around town. I know under the pier's one, down by the bike trails in the state park's another. There's alot of them. The pitch is they've got little symbols for each one, and that's how they tell each other the place, so word won't get around. So this might be that.
M	BRENDAN	But Dode wouldn't know it?
M	THE BRAIN	This is upper crust. Dode's pie pan grease.
M	BRENDAN	Call anything up? How many places start with 'A'? Or if it's a shape, or just a random symbol. Anyway, even if you figured it out, what good could you do? She's smart, she knows the play, she's gunning to square things.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	THE BRAIN	You said her business was none of yours, so she's alright, forget it now. Go home, sleep. staring off into space.

M	VOICE ON PHONE	Saint Clement police.
M	VOICE ON PHONE (cont'd)	Saint Clement police, hello? Hello? impossibly large book. He watches curiously as Brendan approaches him.
M	THE BRAIN	Hey, Brendan. You're up early.
M	BRENDAN	I couldn't sleep.
M	THE BRAIN	Find Emily? You alright?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah. What, are you here for zero?
M	THE BRAIN	Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause the others don't run by my street.
M	BRENDAN	Bad break.
M	THE BRAIN	Eh. Time to read's nice. So what's the word with Em?
M	BRENDAN	She's gone.
M	THE BRAIN	Can't raise her?
M	BRENDAN	No, I can't.
M	THE BRAIN	So what now? Now. I don't know. I guess it's... I don't know.
M	BRENDAN (cont'd)	Brain, I can't let her go. I was set to but I can't. I don't think I can.
M	THE BRAIN	You think you can help her?
M	BRENDAN	No.
M	THE BRAIN	You think you can get the straight, maybe break some deserving teeth?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah. I think I could.
M	THE BRAIN	Well.
M	BRENDAN	Kara tried to rope me. She came right out and asked. She was scared. Tell me to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to drop it.
M	THE BRAIN	Walk from it. Drop it. You're thick as what-all, Brendan. BRENDAN Yes I am. I'd need you to Op. Like on Jerr, but that was cake to this. And unlike Jerr, there's not much chance we'll come out clean. Twenty four seven on this one. You okay to op for me again? The Brain barely smiles.
M	THE BRAIN	What first, tip the bulls?
M	BRENDAN	No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one. But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this I want the whole story. No cops, not for a bit.
M	THE BRAIN	So what first?
M	BRENDAN	I don't know. Your mom still have the cell?
M	THE BRAIN	In her car.
M	BRENDAN	Borrow it for a few days, get me the number. Wait for my word, and cover for me first period. I'm going to be a little late. it, his steps heavy.

Which Joe would not even consider, thank god. gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the body.1
M	THE BRAIN	There's the cell number.
M	BRENDAN	Keep it on vibrate.
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	Better stop meeting me in the open too. I'm going to start getting visible, and I need you on the underneath. I'll call.
M	THE BRAIN	Trueman asked for you. Wants words in his office.
M	BRENDAN	I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him, he won't bite, just keep him away from me.
M	THE BRAIN	I'll try. So what's first?
M	BRENDAN	Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to throw a few words at you, tell me if they catch. Brick.
M	THE BRAIN	No. A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure
M	BRENDAN	Or bad brick.
M	THE BRAIN	No.
M	BRENDAN	Tug.
M	THE BRAIN	Tug... that might be a drink.
M	BRENDAN	Drink?
M	THE BRAIN	Vodka and milk or something, or maybe not.
M	BRENDAN	Poor Frisco.
M	THE BRAIN	Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore last year, I think. Real trash, maybe hit a class a week. Didn't know him then, and haven't seen him around.
M	BRENDAN	Pin.
M	THE BRAIN	Pin... the Pin?
M	BRENDAN	The Pin, yeah.
M	THE BRAIN	The Pin's kind of a local spook story. You know the Kingpin? BRENDAN I've heard it.
M	THE BRAIN	Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26, lives in town. All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who Jake1 runner, right?
M	THE BRAIN	Big time... maybe. Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang they'll say they scraped it from that who scored it from this who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the list'll always end with the Pin. But I'll becha you got every rat in town together and said 'show your hands' if any of them've actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd of full pockets.
M	BRENDAN	You think the Pin's just a tale to take whatever heat?
M	THE BRAIN	But what's first?
M	BRENDAN	A show of hands.
F	KARA	Hey Brendan. Here for the show?
M	BRENDAN	No.
F	KARA	Would you go then, honey, cause I've got this headache.
M	BRENDAN	Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard that helps. In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to `Dope runner' in post
M	BRENDAN (cont'd)	Isn't this Dode's brand?
F	KARA	You don't know Dode's brand.
M	BRENDAN	Oh I do now.
M	BRENDAN (cont'd)	I'm going to start shaking things up. Give me the story and you might miss the bite.
F	KARA	The story about what?
M	BRENDAN	Alright.
F	KARA	The story about what?
M	BRENDAN	I don't want to play games if you've got a headache. Get me if you want to spill it, but I can't guarantee safe passage after tonight.
F	KARA	I don't know what- At the stage door, not slowing.
M	BRENDAN	Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling card, and I need words.
F	KARA	Brad Bramish? Through the door and into the theater.
M	BRENDAN	Tail Kara through lunch. She's got rehearsal but she'll blow early. She goes home, drop her, else wait for my call. Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far end of the lot. Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow.
M	BRAD	That's all I'm saying, is put me in the but they don't put me in, what needs doing don't get done and don't come crying to me, man. Get off my grill man, you didn't put me in, don't come to me if you didn't let me play.
M	BIFF	They didn't! one of the cars.
M	BRAD	Hey! What are you doing here? Listening.
M	BRAD	Uh huh.
M	BRENDAN	Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the Gophers.
M	BRAD	Oh yeah?
M	BRENDAN	Of all things, yeah. Been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. You've got heart, kid. How soon can you move to Minneapolis?
M	BRAD	Yeah?
M	BRENDAN	Cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system.
M	BRAD	Yeah?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	BRAD	Oh yeah?
M	BRENDAN	There's a thesaurus in the library. 'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait.
M	BRAD	Who invited you?
M	BRENDAN	To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of invited myself.
M	BRAD	I think you'd better leave then. No, I'm having too good a time.
M	BRAD	Just the same. Maybe you want to go someplace more private.
M	BRENDAN	With you?
M	BRENDAN (cont'd)	Sure.
M	BRAD	You know what's good for you you'll just beat it. Beating a small frye won't win me anything and it's not going to do you any good- pavement. then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face. people rushing over.
M	STRAGGLER	Hey, is there a fight?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
F	LAURA	Hey.
F	LAURA	You're quite a pill. BRENDAN Uh huh.
F	LAURA	Where are you going?
M	BRENDAN	Home.
F	LAURA	Why did you take a powder the other night?
M	BRENDAN	Same reason I'm taking one now.
F	LAURA	Hold it. I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to be giving a girl who's where you want to know about.
M	BRENDAN	I'll get where I'm going just fine.
F	LAURA	I want to help you.
M	BRENDAN	Go away. Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and I'm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so I'm better off coming at it clean.
F	LAURA	I wouldn't have to lead you in by the hand-
M	BRENDAN	I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player. With you behind me I'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and I can't spare it.
F	LAURA	You're not Brad.
M	BRENDAN	No, I'm not.
M	THE BRAIN	You didn't call.
M	BRENDAN	Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't she?
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didn't want on her phone bill.
M	BRENDAN	Get the numbers?
M	THE BRAIN	No. Sorry.
M	BRENDAN	S'alright. Are me and Brad front page news?
M	THE BRAIN	All the buzz. You really do that?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	THE BRAIN	Why? Is Brad the Pin?
M	BRENDAN	Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. So now I know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. That's not why I roughed him, though. For kicks?
M	BRENDAN	Economics. Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention. Anyway, now's just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang?
M	THE BRAIN	I told you before I don't know the car. Those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody I know that you don't. And Trueman again-
M	BRENDAN	Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I need to find that kid.
M	THE BRAIN	Okay. Brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny desk and name plate, "GARY TRUEMAN, ASSISTANT VICE PRINCIPAL" plays with a pencil.
M	TRUEMAN	You didn't know this boy?
M	BRENDAN	No sir, never seen him.
M	TRUEMAN	And he just hit you?
M	BRENDAN	Like I said, he asked for my lunch money first. Good thing I brown bagged it.
M	TRUEMAN	Alright Brendan. I've been looking to talk to you.
M	TRUEMAN (cont'd)	You've helped this office out before.
M	BRENDAN	No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not to see you fed.
M	TRUEMAN	Fine, and well put.
M	BRENDAN	Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk.
M	TRUEMAN	Tough teacher?
M	BRENDAN	Tough but fair.
M	TRUEMAN	Mm. Anyway then, we know you're clean, and you've, despite your motives, you've been an asset to us. I think you're a good kid.
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh.
M	TRUEMAN	I want to run a couple names by you. We're not done here.
M	BRENDAN	I was done here three months ago. I told you then I'd give you Jerr and that was that, I'm not your inside line and I'm not your boy.
M	TRUEMAN	That's not a very helpful-
M	BRENDAN	You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here?
M	TRUEMAN	What are you in?
M	BRENDAN	No. And no more of these informal chats - if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the parent conference.
M	TRUEMAN	Hold it, I could - hold it - could write you up for talking back to a VP. For looking at me in a threatening way. I'd exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye. You can't pull a play like that unless I need you for something. So do I?
M	BRENDAN	Maybe. So maybe you're gonna need me too.
M	BRENDAN	Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back completely for a few weeks. There might be some heat soon.
M	TRUEMAN	If it's something I can't cover, I won't go to bat for you.
M	BRENDAN	If I get caught like that it's curtains anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting me favors in public. I'm just saying now so you don't come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts.
M	TRUEMAN	Okay, here's what I can do. I won't pin you for anything you aren't caught at. I'll ride it a little while, as long as it doesn't get too rough. But if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep will need someone to hand over, police- wise. And I'll have you. There better be some meat at the end of this like you say, or at least a fall guy, or you're it.
M	BRENDAN	Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.
M	TRUEMAN	Get the hell off my campus, punk! Brendan glances around, and limps off.
M	THE BRAIN	No, Dode's MIA all around. I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who knows where. I shook but she's not spilling.
M	THE BRAIN	No more job offers? So she's got a play.
M	BRENDAN	And I know enough about Kara to let that worry me. Alright, keep your specs on for him. Any other news?
M	THE BRAIN	Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking for you.
M	BRENDAN	She did, huh?
M	THE BRAIN	Fourth period, nearly shook me upside down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me?
M	BRENDAN	She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me.
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If I had known where you were I might have told her.
M	BRENDAN	That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode, tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll call you tonight. mustang. Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground, his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case to his knees. back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone, doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.
M	BRENDAN	I want to see the Pin.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, I guess you do. looks back up. Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor.1 Brendan closes the trunk. goes into the lit room. Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise. Brendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like Tugger, others dressed in black.
M	TUGGER	Alright. comfortably woven and very worn in. scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and swivels around. specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up.
M	BRENDAN	You the Pin?
M	PIN	Yeah. So now I'm very very curious what you're going to say next.
M	BRENDAN	Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.
M	PIN	Helled if you're gonna go breaking my best clients' noses and expect me to play sandbag. Anyway you've been sniffing me out before then, sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a horse with a nick on its ear he can suck on. They do that. So now you got Tugger to bring you here, which he never does, and you got me listening, so I'm curious what you've got to say that better be really, really good.
M	BRENDAN	Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first; she oughta hear this.
M	PIN	No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat trick, though.
M	BRENDAN	I was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal, anything so you'd let me walk. Then I was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh.
M	TUGGER	He knows zippo.
M	BRENDAN	1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at the desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox. You gonna do what now?!
M	PIN	No good, soldier. Alright, let up. cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces the din.
F	LAURA	Tug, stop.
M	BRENDAN	Where are my glasses? Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door in? Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall.
M	PIN	Sorry about this kid, but what the hell with what you said before. His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had Where you were at, with all of us and the Tug a fist away, you've got to use your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah, you're not scared of me, I got it, but I'm also thinking you're a little nuts now, so you've got that trade off with your standing. But nuts isn't all bad, so maybe it was a good play. I don't know. that his face seems to bob about in space. Brendan stifles a So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you upstairs, back with the living.
M	MOTHER	I thought we had orange juice, Brendan, I'm sorry. How about Tang, or that's more like soda isn't it, or not soda but it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't be very fortifying.
M	BRENDAN	Water's fine, ma'am, thanks.
M	MOTHER	Now just a moment, we have apple juice here, if you'd like that, or milk, though you've got that in your cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it as well might be too much.
M	BRENDAN	Apple juice sounds terrific.
M	MOTHER	It's country style. That's perfect. small delicate bites.
M	MOTHER	I'll even give it to you in a country glass, how'd that be? Boys?
M	TUGGER	I'm fine, Mrs. M.
M	PIN	Thanks, mom.
M	MOTHER	Okay, well I'm going to go, um, do something in the other room now...
M	PIN	So hows bout we take another snap at hearing your tale?
M	BRENDAN	I don't know. It starts out same as before, and this floor ain't carpeted.
M	PIN	We're cooled off.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty cool putting his fist in my head. I want him out.
M	PIN	Looky, soldier-
M	BRENDAN	The ape blows or I clam. So clam! What've you got I can't beat out of you back in the basement?
M	PIN	Give us a few minutes, Tug. I'll call you if whatever. So?
M	BRENDAN	About a year ago I had a small time dealing partnership with Jerr Madison. Know him?
M	PIN	Till he took the fall for you.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he was a straight player. I got out clean - almost. Nothing on my official record, but the VPs play it like I owe them one. When I made it clear I wasn't playing their hound dog, well they didn't like it. They keep calling me in, badgering me.
M	PIN	Gee that's tough.
M	BRENDAN	I don't like being told whose side I'm on. So now they think I'm on your trail, I'm in a nice spot to know their movements and feed them yours.
M	PIN	I gotcha.
M	BRENDAN	You haven't got me yet.
M	PIN	What, price?
M	BRENDAN	Considering the benefits my services could yield, I don't think that's unreasonable.
M	PIN	And what are your services exactly, just so I can be specific on the invoice?
M	BRENDAN	Whatever serves your interests.
M	PIN	Fair enough. I'll have my boys check your tale, and seeing how it stretches we'll either rub or hire you. You'll know which by end of the day tomorrow. We're done.
F	LAURA	I'll drive you back.
M	BRENDAN	Just drop me at school. How long was I out?
F	LAURA	Half an hour. It took all of it for me to cool the Pin down.
M	BRENDAN	Thanks.
F	LAURA	You trust me now?
M	BRENDAN	Less than when I didn't trust you before. If you can tell me your angle in this, maybe I can.
F	LAURA	Come here.1 I'm on the in, top level of the tower and I know everyone, but I don't know all what goes on. I knew Em when she tried to get with me and Brad, and I liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't us, and it didn't work. When she left she took some souvenirs, dirty habits she wasn't strong enough to control and a connection to the Pin to keep them going. With me?
M	BRENDAN	So far.
F	LAURA	A few months go by, and the next I hear the Pin's raging over a situation with some certain junk Em was partial to, and the downfall's coming on Em's head.
M	BRENDAN	You think Em scraped the junk off the Pin? Not to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene (shot as written) is on the I don't know, but whether she scraped or copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back, it must have been grand. I've never seen the Pin so hot.
M	BRENDAN	This all helps but it's not what I asked. What's your angle in all this?
F	LAURA	I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp, but... maybe I see what you're doing for Emily, trying to help her. And I don't know anyone who would do that for me.
M	BRENDAN	Now you are dangerous. Brendan pushes in. Kara sits at the mirror, putting on eyeliner.
F	KARA	Brendan Brendan Brendan!
M	BRENDAN	Where's Dode flopped? I know you two are cozed up, so you'll tell me or you won't.
F	KARA	Oooh, getting feisty. Last time we talked you were giving ultimate-tims. It worked. You went to Laura, didn't you? Told her my tale.
F	KARA	All part of your plan?
M	BRENDAN	Turned out to be.
F	KARA	I feel so cheap and used.
M	BRENDAN	Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I just hate myself.
F	KARA	Whatever happened to us, Brendan?
M	BRENDAN	Where's Dode flopped?
F	KARA	We were a pair and a half for a few months, weren't we? Sometimes I miss having someone I can talk to. You ever miss having someone? I guess you must.
M	BRENDAN	I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily. It's important.
F	KARA	You better be sure you wanna know whatcha wanna know.
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon. The sooner I get the truth from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the he gets hurt.
F	KARA	You didn't, did you?
M	THE BRAIN	So what happens now?
M	BRENDAN	Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless his crew spotted VP Truman's social call this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us 70/30. If we're in I get under his skin and see what's what. You stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from Laura.
M	THE BRAIN	I think she's with us, Brendan.
M	BRENDAN	I'll let you know when she is.
M	THE BRAIN	Okay.
M	ALEXANDER".	He fishes the old note out and compares them - different handwriting. The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the
M	BRENDAN	You the Pin's? So what's his answer? lug's right paw. running. doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him. seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right. Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his BRENDAN around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed. and a large brownie in another baggie.
M	BRENDAN	Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a sheepdog.
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to any crowd. He's definitely not muscle for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd but doesn't hang with them. If you've got a guess I could check it out-
M	BRENDAN	The Pin. If he's with the Pin everything's kablooie and I gotta blow the burgh.
M	THE BRAIN	I'll check it. I'm in third now- Brendan spots the Pin's Cady pulling into the parking lot.
M	BRENDAN	Never mind. If I don't call by three call in the bulls.
M	VOICE	Get in. Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at each other.
M	BRENDAN	So?
M	PIN	So. Tangles. That's what you'll get every week for your services. Less of course there's a specific job involved, in where you get sliced in with my crew. Square?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	PIN	We're doing a thing down at the Hole tonight. Know it? South of T Street, yeah.
M	PIN	It's sort of a welcome you in thing. Eight o'clock.
M	VOICE	I know what you did. I saw what you did.1
M	BRENDAN	So?
M	VOICE	Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some way. And I'm going to tell someone.
M	BRENDAN	Are you making an offer?
M	VOICE	Maybe. Or maybe I'll just do you in.
M	BRENDAN	Hire another hash head to blade me? Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post Don't need no blades, shamus. I just gotta squawk.
M	BRENDAN	What do you want?
M	VOICE	Just to see you sweat.
M	THE BRAIN	Brendan?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	THE BRAIN	You alright?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the Burns lug, but the main thing is to find Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked into, it's getting more and more urgent we talk.
M	THE BRAIN	Alright. Trueman was looking for you.
M	BRENDAN	Trueman and the VP?
M	THE BRAIN	No, just Trueman.
M	BRENDAN	Asked for me?
M	THE BRAIN	No, but looked.
M	BRENDAN	That's not good. Alright, keep me posted. wander towards us on the dark beach.
M	PIN	So I'm going to start you on the dope circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues, pulling in the strags.
M	BRENDAN	Small fries.
M	PIN	Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle. Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm tailing out this big deal, but that's almost done.
M	BRENDAN	Oh yeah? What was it?
M	PIN	Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there was a snag in it, but it's almost done now.
M	BRENDAN	What was it?
M	PIN	It's over.
M	BRENDAN	Almost, you said.
M	PIN	It's over enough. You're gonna make me curious, being so curious.
M	PIN (cont'd)	I gotta lay something out. You're coming into a certain situation, and I'm bringing you in sort of because of it. If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I decided I oughta hear what you were gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug just did it, though. He was hot, and he just hit you. He's been doing that.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah?
M	PIN	He's got my best interests, I know, he's loyal, he just gets hot.
M	BRENDAN	Muscle you can't control's no good at that.
M	PIN	You're working for me, not Tug, that's all.
M	BRENDAN	Alright.
M	PIN	Things can get, you know, it's tough sometimes. Twisted, complicated, watching all the, I don't know. Everyone's got their thing. You read Tolkien?
M	BRENDAN	What?
M	PIN	Tolkien, the Hobbit books?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	PIN	His descriptions of things are really good.
M	BRENDAN	Oh yeah? He makes you want to be there. squealing behind him.
M	THE BRAIN	Don't go to class.
M	BRENDAN	What?
M	THE BRAIN	Fifth period Trueman and the VP come in asking for you.
M	BRENDAN	Agh.
M	THE BRAIN	Did they call your mom?
M	BRENDAN	Probably. I got home late.
M	THE BRAIN	Get out of there too, then. Meet me behind the library. I've got some stuff. A cold gray morning. The Brain hands Brendan a photocopy of a newspaper clipping, "LOCAL YOUTH HOSPITALIZED"
M	THE BRAIN	Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks ago. He was in a coma, his stomach contained a sausage sandwich, a horse dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in laundry detergent. Frisco's still under and nobody's talking, so nothing's come of it.
M	BRENDAN	OD?
M	THE BRAIN	No, the chem the junk must have been cut with put him down.
M	BRENDAN	Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick... could that form of Heroin be called 'Brick'?
M	THE BRAIN	No -- it was a concentrated powder, its street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or 'brock'. Here. From Laura.
M	BRENDAN	I told you to stay clear of Laura.
M	THE BRAIN	You tell her to stay clear of me?
M	BRENDAN	I gotta get voicemail. No. Tell her I'll be at the Pin's at one. Any luck with the lug?
M	THE BRAIN	No.
M	BRENDAN	This isn't good. Mr. Trueman please.
M	TRUEMAN	This is Trueman.
M	BRENDAN	What the hell are you doing asking for me in class?
M	TRUEMAN	What the hell are you doing out of class?
M	BRENDAN	What?
M	TRUEMAN	The VP and I needed to ask you a few questions about Emily Kostich, who you might have heard is missing. It's a very serious thing. The police are involved. The VP and I knew you two were close, so the VP and I came to ask you questions, but you were truant. If you don't have a valid excuse-
M	THE BRAIN	What?
M	BRENDAN	I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here. We shouldn't have met in the open. Alright, lay low, but ask on the underneath for Dode. That's all that matters now, find Dode, but do it on the underneath, got it?
M	THE BRAIN	What are you going to do?
M	BRENDAN	I'd like to have played it safe, but there's no time. The Pin's not letting anything drop, so I gotta push things a bit.
M	THE BRAIN	How?
M	BRENDAN	I don't know. Just find Dode. door, and it gives. Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of the hall. balls of his feet. listening - silence. Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white eyes caught in the bare light. were other bricks there before.
M	TUGGER	What with the poking, genius?! Maybe you're poking for your bull friends!
M	BRENDAN	Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at school, the VP's so hot for me.
M	TUGGER	Yeah well. Maybe you're looking to make good.
M	BRENDAN	I'm looking to find this big game the Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so when its tail jams in my back I'll know who to bill for the embalming.
M	TUGGER	You oughta ask him what you wanna know.
M	BRENDAN	I did. He didn't tell me. When a gee I'm paid to side with won't give me the straight that makes me nervous. Makes me angry.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, well. That's understandable.
M	TUGGER	There was ten of them. I don't know where he picked them, he didn't tell me.
M	BRENDAN	Huh.
M	TUGGER	So we get ten kils of brock, there aint enough marks in the whole burgh to eat that. So he unloads eight of em up way north, even up to the docks. I don't know who.
M	BRENDAN	Didn't tell you.
M	TUGGER	Yeah. That was eight. So that's the tenth in there. We gotta break it into doses, sell em off round the high, maybe some by Shorecliffs.
M	BRENDAN	What about the ninth brick?
M	TUGGER	Ah yeah. There were problems with that.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah?
M	TUGGER	He stops, thinking harder than he's used to. His scar It disappeared. Someone skimmed it. We started raising hell with all the likely suspects, and whatayaknow, it came back. But it came back bad. One of ours took a dose off the top, and it laid him out.
M	BRENDAN	Frisco.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, poor Frisco. You heard about that. We'll track down the rat. Just takes time.
M	BRENDAN	I heard something fell with Emily Kostich.
M	TUGGER	Emily who?
M	BRENDAN	Kostich.
M	TUGGER	Don't know her.
M	BRENDAN	Huh.
M	TUGGER	Has the Pin talked about her? BRENDAN Not to me.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, he might know something. Ask him. Tell me what he says, cause if you heard something, you know, I wanna check.
M	BRENDAN	Sure. The screen door swings open -- enter the Pin. If he's surprised he doesn't show it. Pow wowing?
M	BRENDAN	Just shooting the shat.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, just shooting it.
M	PIN	Good. You alright, soldier?
M	PIN (cont'd)	So, Tug, I got a call. Someone who says they know something about Emily.
M	TUGGER	Emily?
M	PIN	Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says we'd want to know. Wants to meet.
M	TUGGER	Yeah?
M	PIN	So we'll meet him. Four o'clock. Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You know Emily, didn't you?
M	BRENDAN	A while back.
M	PIN	You've heard she's missing?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah, I heard that.
M	PIN	So maybe you want to come along too. What has Emily got to do with you?
M	PIN	Show, maybe we'll find out. Four o'clock.
M	BRENDAN	That's my ride.
M	PIN	Four o'clock.
M	BRENDAN	A payphone, anywhere.
F	LAURA	What-
M	PAYPHONE	The mobile customer you have called is away from the phone- spins backwards into
M	BRENDAN	What time is it?
F	LAURA	Lie down, Brendan- BRENDAN What time-
F	LAURA	You've got a fever, you've got to go to the hospital or-
M	BRENDAN	What time is it?
F	LAURA	Three forty. You've got to rest, you're feverish.
F	LAURA	Get back in the car, I'm taking you home, you're sick, you need-
M	BRENDAN	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Okay, you've got to, what you've got to do is drive around to the Carrows lot. I'll be up on the, the blacktop, the basketball field. So you've got to go by you or me to get down there. If you see anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their crew go down into the ravine, honk four times, long short long short. But don't be seen.
F	LAURA	Get back in the car. Do it! Will you do it? I need you to do this. I need you, here. Please. crooked, watching the barren horizon. The wind blows bitterly, and the sky is dark.
M	BRENDAN	What are you doing, Dode?
M	DODE	You gonna stop me?
M	BRENDAN	What do you think you're doing, Dode? DODE I saw you. I saw what you did.
M	BRENDAN	What'd you see?
M	DODE	I saw you.
M	BRENDAN	What'd you see me?
M	DODE	You were with her, dead, and you took the body.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah, I did. That's all you saw? What about before?
M	DODE	Before what?
M	BRENDAN	Did you see who killed her before I got there?
M	DODE	You killed her.
M	BRENDAN	I found the body, Dode.
M	DODE	You, I thought you didn't, but we figured out, I got the news on ya, cause you hid the body, why wouldn't-
M	BRENDAN	Who's 'we'?
M	DODE	Shut up! You're always talking, always this and that smartso, you're gonna shut up now!
M	BRENDAN	I didn't kill her, Dode.
M	DODE	You're not going to talk this!
M	BRENDAN	Dode, I know you're thinking of Em, I know you tried to help her-
M	DODE	Shut up! You're gonna shut your put it over real nice- -so I'm telling you now you're in over your head, you don't want to put your hand in this-
M	DODE	Shut up! She's dead, you-
M	BRENDAN	Why was she scared, Dode? She came to me, who was she scared of? I think I know why, I just gotta know who! DODE You're trying to confuse me.
M	BRENDAN	Dode.
M	DODE	You couldn't stand it. Your little Em. She was gonna keep it, it was mine, and you couldn't stand that.
M	BRENDAN	What was yours?
M	DODE	I had you pegged.
M	BRENDAN	What was yours? DODE I loved her. And I woulda loved the kid. I'm gonna bury you. and we are looking at Emily's picture in the newspaper article. Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet. Everyone looks at Brendan.
M	BRENDAN	What'd I miss?
M	PIN	Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead.
M	BRENDAN	Oh yeah?
M	PIN	Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He says he knows where the body's at. And he says he wants more money than I think the information's worth.
M	BRENDAN	That so, Dode? you anyways?
M	DODE	Plenty.
M	PIN	Plenty, he says.
M	BRENDAN	Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail. He's a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood. Why pay for dirt you can't believe?
M	DODE	You'll believe this.
M	BRENDAN	Maybe you will.
M	DODE	You'll believe it, cause it's someone close to you. Real close.
M	BRENDAN	Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't trust it.
M	DODE	Real close.
M	BRENDAN	I'm getting my shoes wet for this. Let him milk you if you want.
M	PIN	Stay. It's still too much.
M	DODE	No it's not. You won't complain when you hear it. Tugger twists a stick in his hands. Brendan watches him,
M	BRENDAN	So maybe you should.
M	DODE	You had her against the wall with the brick -
M	PIN	I know my business. It's still too much.
M	DODE	It's not, cause that's not why she was killed, and it's real important to you, cause the person who killed her's real close, and cause he's got a lot to lose, and he knows if I don't bury him by spilling to you I spill to the bulls and bury him for real, and he's really really scared - she had a kid in her and he couldn't stand -
M	BRENDAN	Tug, it's alright!
M	PIN	Tug, stop.
M	TUGGER	She sprung it on me, just. That's a hell of a thing to spring on a guy. I don't remember much. Laura talked me down after, said whatever, she knew her, said it wasn't true, but I still think sometimes. I think bout it being true. Bout it being mine. And maybe I did it cause I thought it was true. A hell of a thing. You up? You weren't doing too good there for awhile. Laura said take you, you know, hospital, but I couldn't.
M	BRENDAN	What's the stats? Everyone's just laying low. You're here with us, at my folks place. They're gone. The bulls got Dode fore the tide took his body.
M	BRENDAN	Tide?
M	TUGGER	Yeah, strong tide, would've taken the body, like out to sea. It can do that. But the fuzz got there first. So everyone's assuming it's war, but no one's said it yet. Everyone's lying low.
M	BRENDAN	War?
M	TUGGER	You're with us.
M	BRENDAN	The hell I am. Alright, I'm with you.
M	TUGGER	So just lie low. Sleep some more. Laura, she said you should sleep. Tugger exits. Brendan runs his fingers through his hair, BRENDAN Hey. They nod back, not paying much attention as he goes out the
M	THE BRAIN	Brendan?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	THE BRAIN	Are you - what, man, have you heard about Dode-
M	BRENDAN	I was there.
M	THE BRAIN	You-
M	BRENDAN	Where were you yesterday? I called.
M	THE BRAIN	Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I just now got it back.
M	BRENDAN	Alright, listen-
M	THE BRAIN	Are you okay?
M	BRENDAN	Just listen. Is my name in the papers with the story?
M	THE BRAIN	No.
M	BRENDAN	Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers? THE BRAIN Yeah. What do you mean?
M	BRENDAN	Listen, I'm going to be calling you tonight, probably late. Sleep with your phone on. Could you get a car if you needed to?
M	THE BRAIN	If it's late enough I could take my mom's-
M	BRENDAN	Be ready then. I'll call.
M	THE BRAIN	Alright.
F	KARA	Brendan. Did you hear about Dode?
M	BRENDAN	You scheming tramp. You set that poor kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale. You got info from Laura and held Dode like a card till you could play him. For money!
F	KARA	I don't know what you're talking about.
M	BRENDAN	You'd bury me at the same time, but it was mostly for the money. You got Dode thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in him, cause he couldn't come away from the deal without it and make you happy.
F	KARA	Sit down, you're a mess. Russ, go get my shoes from the wardrobe locker, would you sweetie? He goes, trying to look mean at Brendan. Brendan and Kara Still wish you knew what you wanted to know? If it's any consolation, it probably wasn't Dode's kid. It might have been Tug's, but frankly I wouldn't bet a horse - it was a crowded field there at the end.
M	KARA (cont'd)	Meany. You want my tale, Brendan? I still know what Dode was selling, but I'd play it smart. A quick call from a payphone to copland, they drag the tunnel and you're through.
M	KARA (cont'd)	Five thousand. Cash. I know you can get it from the Pin, but even if you can't I want it by first period tomorrow, or I play my hand and bury you. Now get out. her.
F	KARA	What are you doing?
M	BRENDAN	Showing your ace. Also on the DVD. Fine retailers everywhere.
M	VOICE	Far enough.
M	PIN	Everyone's paying social calls.
M	BRENDAN	Laura here?
M	PIN	So?
M	BRENDAN	So what are the stats?
M	PIN	The stats are war, soon as the press heat dies. And if you're with him, you're with him.
M	BRENDAN	Tug got hot. He panicked.
M	PIN	Tug's been after my digs from the get go.
M	BRENDAN	No. He's been anxious cause he thought if you found out he killed Emily you'd turn him over. PIN He was right.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah, well.
M	PIN	I told him to get the straight, no roughing. I wasn't even there. Alright. So he's a hot head. So you don't want him on your side, at least let's have a pow wow fore we start digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk away amiable enemies. What would it take?
M	PIN	I don't know. We'd have to square everything between us. He owes me some money.
M	BRENDAN	Alright, but we can talk.
M	PIN	Yeah, alright.
M	BRENDAN	Four o'clock.
M	PIN	Tomorrow?
M	BRENDAN	Tonight. Let's clear it all before it boils up again.
M	PIN	Four tonight. You'll be here?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah. Wait! She comes out of the house with her purse. I'll drive you back. What's going to happen? Do you feel better?
M	BRENDAN	I don't know.
M	TUGGER	For a smart guy you aint too smart. I said lay low.
F	LAURA	Tug.
M	BRENDAN	She was at the Pin's.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, she's our go-between. Uh huh. So here's the sit. You and the Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock tonight, his place. Take all the muscle you want, you won't need it. He wants to talk straight, and you're going to work with him for whatever he needs, cause you don't want war.
M	TUGGER	Hell I don't. BRENDAN The Pin's sitting on the brick profits - hitting him now would be post. Make peace and wait for your chance.
F	LAURA	He's right, Tug. Smooth it out.
M	BRENDAN	Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing. War'll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, we'll talk.
F	LAURA	You going?
M	BRENDAN	Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	Go away.
F	LAURA	I'm sorry Brendan. Spinning above them.
F	LAURA	Don't go tonight.
M	BRENDAN	I've got to make sure it plays out smooth.
F	LAURA	It'll play however it plays without you there.
M	BRENDAN	I've got to make sure.
F	LAURA	Why? Cause if there's war, I'm in it too.
F	LAURA	Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car. I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care. Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not? What, school? C'mon. Family?
M	BRENDAN	Alright, stop. LAURA I wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile. Just until everything clears. Laura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then
M	BRENDAN	Tell your boys no knuckle business.
M	TUGGER	They're just ready.
M	BRENDAN	Your folks left a car here? TUGGER Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	Take it and Laura's. I'll go first in yours.
M	TUGGER	The hell-
M	BRENDAN	I'll take the scenic route to draw off any tailers. They'll think it's you, they might even radio back that you're alone. Get it?
M	TUGGER	Mr. Smarts.
M	BRENDAN	Alright. Got a cigarette?
M	TUGGER	No. I don't smoke.
M	BRENDAN	I've seen you smoke. I don't smoke cigarettes.
M	BRENDAN	Give me fifteen minutes, then go.
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	Alright, I warned you. Can you get the car?
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her. Alright? Alright?
M	THE BRAIN	Okay. I'll call you when it gets light. Thanks, Brain. pouring them milk. quickly.
M	BRENDAN	Talk.
M	PIN	I want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you. I don't even want my name pulled in the shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but I want your shake that it'll come home in not too much time.
M	BRENDAN	That's square. You did them after all. Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this, one of you'll dish it to bury the other and you'll both get the rap. As to the six, did you borrow it?
M	TUGGER	Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake on that.
M	TUGGER	Alright to both. Good. Let's seal it up and blow for keeps.
M	PIN	Third thing. The last brick.
M	BRENDAN	It's yours.
M	PIN	That aint the point. I'm gonna start selling it. How do I know it aint bad?
M	BRENDAN	Why would it be?
M	PIN	Why was the last one? Cause someone got greedy. Tug here's had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time. Now we're splits my loss of trust's retroactive.
M	BRENDAN	Did you, Tug?
M	TUGGER	No.
M	BRENDAN	Alright, so let's shake and blow.
M	PIN	Not good enough. BRENDAN What would be good enough?
M	PIN	I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove it. Then we're square.
M	TUGGER	Hell for that! I didn't touch your junk, that's it. I wanna see it.
M	TUGGER	To hell!
M	PIN	Your not wanting to dose it's telling me something right here.
M	TUGGER	Yeah, it better be! It's telling that I'm out from your thumb, that I aint playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple no more!
M	BRENDAN	I'll dose it.
M	PIN	What?
M	BRENDAN	If it'll shut you two apes up I'll take the dose, and if I don't die we're all right as rain, and if I do die you two have your war, so long as you keep it off my grave. Deal?
M	PIN	Fine. Tangles.
M	BRENDAN	Johnny, go with him. They go. hitting the ground. No!
M	TANGLES	The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone. The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug.
M	PIN	Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your boys in my den soes you could snag it under my nose?
M	TUGGER	Alright!
M	BRENDAN	No, that's not-
M	PIN	Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't know, or sell it off to flat the war odds?
M	BRENDAN	Pin, think about it-
M	TUGGER	Alright, I did all that! Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into straight blows into the Pin's face. I cut the brick, I stole the money, I faked a peace, I snagged your junk, I did it all!
M	PIN	Do him! Do him now! Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway. The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for the brick.
M	BRENDAN	Hey. Where are you?
M	THE BRAIN	Library. Where are you?
M	BRENDAN	Did she blow last night?
M	THE BRAIN	No. Stayed there till six thirty, then walked to school.
M	BRENDAN	You didn't give her a ride, did you?
M	THE BRAIN	No.
M	BRENDAN	But she came straight to school from Tug's?
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah.
M	BRENDAN	She there now?
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah. Not with me, but here.
M	BRENDAN	Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the basketball field in half an hour, then go home and get some sleep.
M	THE BRAIN	Alright. Brendan hangs up, then pauses, lost in thought. Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled "VP Offices". it, bracing himself against the wind.
F	LAURA	Did you see it all? With Tug and the Pin?
M	BRENDAN	No. I took your advice and didn't go.
F	LAURA	No?
M	BRENDAN	What happened?
F	LAURA	The papers say six dead, three around the house, one girl in the trunk of Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah? LAURA police got there. They tied him to Dode, too. Same gun. And the girl.
M	BRENDAN	Huh.
F	LAURA	Well good thing you weren't there. Yeah.
F	LAURA	You think the girl was Emily?
M	BRENDAN	Probably.
F	LAURA	You loved her.
M	BRENDAN	Yeah I did.
F	LAURA	You did all this cause you loved her. And now it's finished. I love you.
M	BRENDAN	No.
F	LAURA	What?
M	BRENDAN	No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the trigger on Em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me. Laura pulls back more. I set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun. That was you, angel.
F	LAURA	What are you talking about? It was you. What, you want the whole tale? You want me to tell it to you?
F	LAURA	Tell it to me.
M	BRENDAN	Alright, from the top. You had your fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin, who you were hooked with. Emily came to you and Brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. She goes on the backburner. Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put it back, but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma. So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape. You know trouble. There's going to be a war over this. And there's Emily. She trusts you. She wants in. It's duck soup.
F	LAURA	No.
M	BRENDAN	You frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose. You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. Last week on the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she saw something she was scared of. Tug's car driving by, the Pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was across the street, angel. She saw the passenger side. She saw you. She saw you and ran like she saw some devil.
F	LAURA	Brendan, why are you-
M	BRENDAN	And she took the hit. Dode hid her away, but the Pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good. Gave her a time, and a place. And sent Tug. Just to get the straight. But maybe you had talked Tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit for you. You let her take it.
F	LAURA	Stop it!
M	BRENDAN	That's the tale.
F	LAURA	Stop it!
M	BRENDAN	You're going to tell me it's not?
F	LAURA	It's not!
M	BRENDAN	Look at me.
F	LAURA	You know me. I've only helped you. How can you - It isn't true!
M	BRENDAN	I hope it isn't. I want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad and the Pin and Tug.
F	LAURA	But I think you knew that meeting was going to blow up. I think that was your final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope everything I wrote in the note I dropped at Gary Trueman's office this morning is wrong. About your and Brad's involvement in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't steal the brick last night. In your purse.
F	LAURA	I didn't.
M	BRENDAN	That's good. That means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse. You didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing.
F	LAURA	Brendan... don't...
M	BRENDAN	It's done. Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of 10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his. Told her it would soften him up. She said she wished she could keep it, but she didn't love the father. I was going to drive her down the next day, we'd found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was starting to show. 3 months. You know whose kid that makes it, or have you known all along? Right up against him. Mother-
M	BRENDAN	You get your straight?
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah. I wouldn't have-
M	BRENDAN	S'alright.
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls, guess Brad Bramish hired him. On his own, just a grudge thing.
M	BRENDAN	Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.
M	THE BRAIN	Yeah, you too. What'd she whisper to you?
M	BRENDAN	She called me a dirty word.
M	THE BRAIN	Alright, you don't have to tell me. Thick.
M	BRENDAN	As what-all. off behind a twisted chain linked fence. towards campus.
