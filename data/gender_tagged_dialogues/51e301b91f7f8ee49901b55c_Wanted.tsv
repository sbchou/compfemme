M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. His wry smile gives way to... Black. And then... in business casual, pretending to have a good time at lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant. At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in. It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant there was a certain amount of inter- office pressure to go to Appleby's and sit at a table of twenty-five with my boss Janice presiding at the head even though she's too tight to pick up the bill. Which meant, the poor bastard waiting on us had to split the check twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf, no less -- don't do us any favors, Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of extreme nachos and then polished off a bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single- handedly... The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and

F	PUJA	I didn't expect for you yourself to come. One of the heads, in the flesh.
M	MR. X	You're an important fence.
F	PUJA	I'm flattered. She reaches over to an attachâ¬ case and removes a file.
M	PUJA (CONT'D)	The name of the target is Henry Helms. Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a
M	PUJA (CONT'D)	He's a journalist who stumbled on to a story exposing a lot of powerful people, people who don't like having their power threatened. MR. x Poor Helms.
F	PUJA	There.have been five attempts on his life, but he has been well protected... and well hidden. Turns out his wife's family has a lot of money. He's in town to accept an award.
M	MR. X	We'll see to it that it never makes his mantle.
F	PUJA	And for that, my clients will pay handsomely. Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens... It's a sh hooter's laser! His eyes go wide as saucers. MR. x .but it's too late as bullets rip into her head. Mr. X crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a. .all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood seeping out of that holy third eye. ...and rolls up quickly, guns ready. .and on a dead sprint across the roof... . he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from left band.

He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet. maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all. Okay... okay... He finally decides... .and takes one step forward... THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee. He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist, Who sent you? For a moment, we're not sure the last marksman's going.to answer. Then... We're... we're just the decoys, man. We were paid to get you out here... The marksman points at a small VIDEO CAMERA sitting on Mr. X's face falls as.those words register, and just then... RA ROCKETS over thetreets of the city, block after block in the blink of any eye... .until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile away.

F	FOX	It was a set-up all the way? Sloan just nods. He then stoops down, shoos some of the flies away with The CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of Sloan's hand as he
M	FOX (CONT'D)	That's two heads in two weeks. Which leaves only one: you. Sloan nods.
M	SLOAN	He wants out.
F	FOX	And killing all three heads gets him that? Sloan nods again. Well, I don't know if we have anyone who can stop him. Sloan squints back up at Fox.
M	SLOAN	There's one person who can.
F	FOX	Yeah? Who? And with that, we... Just then, the shot FREEZE-FRAMES, and we see IN THE
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at the corner of my desk, you'll see the billing reports I was supposed to hand in to Janice an hour ago. The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen for just .then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice reaches
M	BOSS JANICE	Oh my fucking god I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your fucking desk. Holy shit on an altar, it isl A couple of the other OFFICE WORKERS look up at the
M	BOSS JANICE (CONT'D)	why don't you just take a dump in your hands, fork it over to me and say, "this is the best effort I'm gonna give to you, Janice. This is the best you're ever gonna get out of me." Hell, Rochelle on her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than your lazy ass and she's already left for the day. Je-sus CHRIST! Wesley looks like he'd rather be anywhere else.
M	WESLEY	I meant to...
M	BOSS JANICE	I meant to... I meant to... Well I meant to be a size four but meaning to doesn't pick no cotton. She snatches up the report off his desk.
M	BOSS JANICE (CONT'D)	Tell you what. I'll just input the four- ones myself. Look everyone, I'm gonna do Wesley's four- ones for him! I don't have enough to do with my own damn job so I'll do Wesley's too! Wesley grabs the report back.
M	WESLEY	I'll do it.
M	BOSS JANICE	Minimum for the maximum. That's all you ever do. The minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this company.
M	WESLEY	I said I'll get it done. I'm sorry.
M	BOSS JANICE	No, you're worthless. I'm the one who's sorry I hired you. She storms away, fuming. Wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers He sits back down to the semi-privacy of his little The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Wesley, bored to tears, The CAMERA FINDS Wesley's note-pad where it looks like you die."
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	My job title is Account Manager. I used to be called an Account Service Representative, but a consultant told us we needed to "manage" our clients and not " service- them. Onemore "life sucks then you die."
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	Her name's Cathy. She works at Banana Republic. The guy she's humping is my best friend, Barry. She's giving it her best. As her MOANS reach a crescendo, we... Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley can spot Wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijL_ Yes. Uh... Well the 602 deals with applications sent by prospective clients and the 603 is when the client is... Everyone is still just staring... I'm sorry, Jesus... uh... what was the question?
M	CONSULTANT	I asked you about the effects of net investment income with regards to underwriting cycles.
M	WESLEY	Well, that's the thing.-
M	CONSULTANT	What's the thing?
M	WESLEY	Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I think it's amistake to apply...
F	JANICE	Good God a'mighty.
M	CONSULTANT	Son... everyone knows that net investment income is inversely related to both premium and loss reserves, making firm cycles inherently dependent on industry cycles! Everyone snickers.
M	CONSULTANT (CONT'D)	In fact, to prove my point, I'd like you to spend some time this afternoon adding up the yearly differential responses.
F	JANICE	Get it to me by five.
M	WESLEY	Sure. Wesley jots down on his pad: "ACTION ITEMS," and underneath it: "Differential responses... then you die." A group of. other WORKERS sit at a table nearby, gossiping
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	There are people, everyday you meet them, who you wish could see you in a different setting, a different place... Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	.instead of where you are, what you've become. Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at
M	LOUDMOUTH AT OTHER TABLE	Nicole! Get your ass over here and.tell us what the hell is going on with you and Whitcock the big cock! He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room for her at his table. Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich.
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't being sucked out of their sockets by monitor fatigue. That you didn't spend five years in college to do goddamn differential responses. see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59
M	WESLEY	C'mon, c'mon. After an eternity, the doors open. But at least at the end. of the day... Wesley steps in and turns around. Before the doors .you know that tomorrow it's going to start all over again. ..and then the doors close. A message comes up: "You have $47.92 in your account. Would you like another transaction?" He clicks "yes" and then "quick cash" and waits for the Wesley enters, toting his bike, only to find Cathy and He's two steps in the door when...
F	CATHY	Where's the spaghetti?
M	WESLEY	What?
F	CATHY	I specifically told you to get noodles on your way home. God, Wesley, I already put the sauce on.
M	WESLEY	Sorry. Iâ¢didn't...
F	CATHY	You didn't listen is what you didn't.- I might as well talk to the wall.
M	WESLEY	I'll be right back. He turns around. You want me to go with you, buddy? What a dick. Wesley doesn't turn around, defeated...
M	WESLEY	I got it.
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	My parents both died when I was born. He grits his teeth as we...
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	The nutjobs I had as foster parents thought any book that didn't contain a red-letter edition was the spawn of the devil... .is. ..so I had to hide my stash like it was a bag of many jane. Stuck in a hole is a copy of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
M	WESLEY (V.0.), (CONT'D)	One time my foster mother found my copy of CATCHER IN THE RYE... .she holds a copy of the book in,her hand, getting
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	.and God told her to beat me with it. Young Wesley takes a beating, WHAP, WHAP, WRAP!
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	.But despite them, I thought I was gonna be something special. grocery store parking lot. Across the street, a man watches from behind the wheel of In fact, it's Cross, the man we last saw assassinating He watches Wesley park the bike and move into the store. Suddenly, a woman's voice pops up behind-him...
F	FOX	There is a remedy for all things but death. She said it so fast he's not sure he heard it right. Kroger's aisles: ox. She's wearing barely enough
M	WESLEY	I'm sorry?
F	FOX	You apologize too much.
M	WESLEY	Sorry? She looks him in the eye.
F	FOX	Spina bifida babies have more backbone than you. With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk. on the sMll f her back is a tatt It' tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d dog. Wesley still isn't sure what the hell is going on.
M	FOX (CONT'D)	I knew your father. Whatever Wesley was expecting_ it wasn't that. He pulls back from her.
M	WESLEY	I think you got the wrong guy.
F	FOX	Can't say that I agree with you, Wesley.
M	WESLEY	What is this? How d'you know my name?
F	FOX	Your father...
M	WESLEY	My father died in a car wreck the week I was born...
F	FOX	,Your father died two days ago on the rooftop. of the Metropolitan Building. For a moment, just a moment, Wesley is stunned, but Fox He'd be damn disappointed in what you've become, too. Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture...
M	WESLEY	Lady...
F	FOX	I've been called a lot of things, but "lady" ain't one of 'em. Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him...
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Damn, Wesley, how d'you ever learn anything when you won't keep your mouth shut and your ears open? I'm trying to tell you about your father. Wesley starts to open his mouth again, but then closes
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Your father, Wesley, wits the greatâ sit assassin to ever live. Your father, Wesley, worked for the Fraternity.
M	WESLEY	The Fraternity?
F	FOX	Your father, Wesley, was set up and gunned down by a man he used to consider a friend. And your father, Wesley... Suddenly, s raises her hands and-LS fist' two blgck
M	FOX (CONT'D)	.taught me everything I know. Wesley takes a step back. What is this?
F	FOX	This is what you've dreamt about all your life. Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e' e also fisting a Da'r of alms. Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM!
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Move! Now! She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle and what is blood. Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas But Wesley and Fox are too quick.. She still has a.hold Wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is
F	FOX	Drive!
M	WESLEY	What?!! But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner, practically going up on two tires. Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and He races through the gears and rips around a corner and
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Where are we going?
F	FOX	Just drive! The Chevelle stays on his tail behind them; Cross drives He spots a side-street...
M	WESLEY	Hold on! ...whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn... He now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for A 4 X 4 Chevy Pickup is headed like a missile right at them... Wesley's eyes go wide.
M	WESLEY	Truck!
F	FOX	Go around it!
M	WESLEY	No! Shoot the tires! Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea, sends it into a violent roll. Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed his idea worked... when finally it SMASHES down into the street Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out... There's a lot of things you don't know about yourself, Wesley.
M	WESLEY	Who was that?
F	FOX	That... was the man who killed your father. And now he's trying to kill you. Wesley forces a laugh, but right now it's hard to paint
M	WESLEY	No. I mean... I told you my father died when I was a baby. She leans right into his face so that their noses are
F	FOX	Have you ever believed that? Have you ever been content with that answer? Wesley stops, not sure of anything right now.
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Today's your new birthday, Wesley. Drive. He settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again,
F	FOX	The people I work with... we believe your father passed his skills on genetically to you. You knew how to handle the car, you knew to shoot at the truck.
F	FOX	It's that confidence we're gonna need to work on. Wesley is still dazed.
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Now I want you to look at me and tell me something. And I want you to be honest with me.
M	WESLEY	What?
F	FOX	Do you think I look fat in this outfit?
M	WESLEY	What?!
F	FOX	I thought so. Let's go. She hops out. They walk inside a... ca f es. There are flies buzzing around and blood If Wesley wasn't nervous before, he is now.
F	FOX	Mr. Sloan. The Butcher looks up from his work and lays down the This is Wesley Gibson. He needs his life changed. The Butcher looks him over.
M	THE BUTCHER	We all end up where we belong, don't we? The Butcher snickers. Sloan speaks up...
M	SLOAN	Fox told you about your father? Wesley looks from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to Like I told... um... the lady here... I think you might ha ve me mixed up with someone else. I'm just an... um... account serv... uh..that is... account manager... and... my father died... He hesitates.
M	SLOAN	When? They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer.
M	WESLEY	I... I guess I'm not sure. Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the
M	SLOAN	Shoot the wings off the flies.
M	WESLEY	What?! Shoot... the wings... off the flies. For. the first time, Wesley notices flies buzzing all
M	WESLEY	I don't... In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun -pointing it at Weslev's temple. He begins to count...
M	SLOAN	You have three seconds. Three... two... Before he can say one, Wesley reacts... blindly firing After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead. Sloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and Four flies lie on - the floor. crawling o d... their
M	IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:	Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this.
F	FOX	Like I said, you got the skills.
M	SLOAN	And after we fine tune those skills... His eyes lock on to Wesley's, holding them in a vice-like .you're going to hunt the man who killed Your father. Wesley is as stunned as we've ever seen him... he blinks
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	Walk with me. He drapes his arm around Wesley and leads him out the
M	SLOAN	I know thin is hard for you to understand, Wesley, but I want you to concentrate on what I'm saying. Your father was a member of the Fraternity, a collection of the most powerful assassins the world has ever known. They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about
M	WESLEY	But I've never heard of...
M	SLOAN	We don't advertise Wesley. We blend into the environment like moths against a tree.
M	SLOAN (V.0.)	We stay in the shadows. .. to the kitchen, where a massive man with a three-
M	SLOAN (V.0.)	We disappear into our surroundings. .until it finds a man with a three-headed dog tattoo on
M	SLOAN	Because the easiest place to hide is in plain sight... .until it finds a GUN SALESMAN holding out a weapon to Fraternity members.
M	SLOAN	..until that time when we are called into action. The lead businessman digs into his steak, and immediately When the CAMERA PANS OVER AGAIN, the Chef is gone.
M	A,	he's cutting a hole all the way through the hedge. The CAMERA SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the He brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet Back at the hole in the hedge, we see the Gardener's He then tucks the gun in his belt and walks out the door, The bell to the Gun Shop jingles as the Gunsmith leaves
M	SLOAN (V.0.)	And when the time comes that we are called, death is as certain as the sun.
M	SLOAN	We have been active for centuries, Wesley... outlasting rulers, governments, nations, kings. We recognize no borders; the entire globe is our killing field. They are buzzed through by THE PHARMACIST, and enter...
M	SLOAN	We are the baddest of the bad, the three- headed dog that guards the gates of hell. We show no mercy, we destroy the weak, we have absolute power. But recently, a fallen angel, one of our own, has challenged that power. The screens in the room come to life with the face of
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	This man left the Fraternity and decided to strike down those who had befriended him, trained him, made him who he is.
M	SLOAN (V.0.)	..a son whose mother died in childbirth... They reach the baby's bed and a pair of strong arms lift
M	SLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)	..he took the boy to an orphanage so his true identity would never be discovered. .and now we see that the other man is a YOUNG MR.
M	SLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)	And I helped him.
M	WESLEY	Why would you do that? Sloan puts a hand on Wesley's shoulder, gently.
M	SLOAN	Your father was like a brother to me. I will do anything to avenge his death.' Sloan turns off the monitors and pulls over a wooden
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	So Wesley... you have a choice. Would you like to go back to your job, your girlfriend, your life, just as it was before? Or would you like to begin your training with an assassin's Fraternity that writes the world's history in blood and bullets? Wesley doesn't know what to say. Sloan moves to a back
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	If the answer is the latter, then have a seat in that chair. If not, you're welcome to head out this door here and we'll never see each other again. With that., Sloan leaves through that back door. But... He stops. He pulls out a gun and waits for Wesley to Wesley is still standing there, unaware of what is on the FLASH: His boss Janice, yelling at him, mocking him. FLASH: His girlfriend on the couch, riding high on Wesley stands frozen, staring hard at the chair as THE FLASHES: The consultant haranguing, the other employees .. as the CAMERA CONTINUES to swirl around him, his face Fuck consultants and fuck action items and fuck differential responses. Fuck it all. He takes a seat in the chair, which creaks when he sits
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Fuck it all. Wesley waits in the chair for what seems an eternity. In comes the Pharmacist. The man is built like a
M	THE PHARMACIST	'Ah, made your choice, did 'ja, of boy? Yeah.
M	THE PHARMACIST	Very good, very good. He walks behind Wesley.
M	THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)	The weather's been lovely the last couple o' days-- would you mind putting your hands back here for me? Wesley does, and the Pharmacist binds his hands with some
M	THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)	There, that's it. Very good.
M	WESLEY	Is this the beginning of my training?
M	THE PHARMACIST	Quite right. The Pharmacist cracks his knuckles and then, WHAM!!! He hits Wesley so hard right in the cheek
M	WESLEY	What the fuck are... WHANIlM 4!!!1 The Pharmacist smashes him again.
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	You know how when you have a dream and wake up unexpectedly...
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	...and the dream is still. on the fringe of your brain but you can't quite remember the details? He looks up at his ceiling fan, barely turning, a few
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	But then you see that same old busted ceiling fan over your bed and you are so damn glad it was just a dream? He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror.
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	This was nothing like that. Smiling, Wesley jumps back on his ten speed and zips into The s in in wheel of the bicycle turns into... staring at it. Then...
M	NICOLE	What happened to your face? Wesley turns in his chair, surprised. Nicole stands I... uh...I got hit by a man much bigger than me. Nicole smiles, flirtatiously.
M	NICOLE	Was this over a girl?
M	WESLEY	Something like that.
M	NICOLE	I had no idea you had such a secret life outside of here. She cocks her head and studies him.
M	NICOLE (CONT'D)	Is there something different about you? Besides the... face?
M	WESLEY	No. Not really. Same old Wesley.
M	NICOLE	I don't think so. She puts her hand on top of his; he can only stare at
M	NICOLE (CONT'D)	You aren't like these people Wesley. I've always thought you were different.
M	WESLEY	Would you consider me to be an observant person?
M	NICOLE	What's that mean? Wesley's about to say something, when he spots Janice heading their way. Wesley nods at her and Nicole frowns.
M	NICOLE (CONT'D)	Uh-oh, here comes the wicked bitch of the west... With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up.
M	BOSS JANICE	Jesus H. Fucking Popscile, you don't have time to get me the differential responses but you got time to chitty-chatty with the intern? Why do I even keep you around, Wesley? Well I know one thing, your review is coming up next week and I can't wait to start checking me off some boxes... attitude: poor, performance: poor, management skills: poor, works well with others... Wesley just focuses on that mouth. Fat lips over fat gums over yellow teeth. But now all that's coming out of ' I Jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to Wesley's ...if only it would just... It's so unbelievably stunning coming out of Wesley's Just because you have one single iota of tenuous power, you think you can push everyone around?
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	.I understand, Janice, that junior high must have been particularly difficult being called Tubby all the time, but that doesn't give you the goddamn right to treat your workers like horseshit. Sure we laugh at you behind your back and sure we know you keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk... Janice looks down at her fingers, which still have a
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	.and sure everyone takes their lunch an hour before you so we can get an extra hour away from you, and I know that must sting sitting by yourself in the White Castle parking lot every day gnawing on your third burger thinking up ways to humiliate us... Janice's eyes fall to her feet.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	.you know, if you weren't such a bitch, we might actually feel sorry for you. As it is, I feel I can speak for the rest of the office when I say... FUCK YOU!!! With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending them flying! Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as The loudmouth from the break-room steps out...
M	LOUDMOUTH	That was great dude! He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just
F	FOX	What's up, new man?
M	WESLEY	You were watching?
F	FOX	Never stopped. How'd it feel, saying exactly what you wanted to say?
M	WESLEY	Like I had a gun in my hands. Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on
F	FOX	You need to get used to the blood and the muscle and the meat and the sinew and what a single blade of steel can do to a chunk of flesh. The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Take care of him, Butcher.
M	THE BUTCHER	Will do, Fox. The Butcher measures Wesley, then starts to talk in a
M	THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)	Remember, it's the body we are killing. Know it like a surgeon. Wesley nods, half disgusted, half enthralled.
M	THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)	Okay, we'll start at the beginning. To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-pick style and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side. He jabs the blade into the beef... and just as he does... .we smash cut to a BUSINESSMAN walking to his car just we... .and the Butcher performs the next move...
M	THE BUTCHER -	To slice the diaphragm, first whip your wrist into the target's trachea to prevent screaming, then drive the knife at a forty-five degree angle upward just below the rib cage. Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut to... . a DRUG KINGPIN coming out of his hotel bathroom who can no longer scream because he's missing his trachea, and just as quickly...
M	THE BUTCHER	If you want the jugular, pull your enemy's head to the left and jab your knife well into his sterno-cleio- mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down and left. Just like before, we smash cut to... ...a MAN moseying down an alley, carrying a briefcase, demonstrating.
M	WESLEY (V.O.)	They never show you this shit on the McDonald's commercials. .. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely absorbed
F	FOX	You haven't quite figured out this whole "blending in" thing, yet. Let's go.
M	WESLEY	What is this?
F	FOX	This... She picks the lock and they step inside...
F	FOX	This is the Roach Motel, Wesley. Wesley looks around, disgusted.
M	FOX (CONT'D)	All right, find us some skinny bitches. Wesley uncovers the first body... it's a. black male.
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some white meat. And nothing too fat. Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Perfect. Load up soccer mom. where you're supposed to aim. The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them
M	SLOAN	Selecting your weapon and then disposing of it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination. An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley.
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	Pick one. Wesley eyes all the weaponry. Finally, he settles on a Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It holds seventeen bullets in the clip and one in the chamber. It's made of a composite material unrecognizable by metal detectors.
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	And the Imanishi's bullets have microchips that communicate with similar ones in the gun.
M	WESLEY	Computer chips? Sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a straight line. What if soccer mom here is between you and your target?
M	WESLEY	I suppose you're going to tell me to shoot her first.
M	SLOAN	How'd you do in Physics class?
M	WESLEY	Mostly B's. Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Okay, I got a D.
M	SLOAN	Why?
M	WESLEY	I couldn't remember all the rules --
M	SLOAN	That's it. Rules. What if I told you there weren't any? He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something.
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	People live by the rules set before them. We take them on faith that they are right. But how many times in your life have you thought you had a better way, against-the rules that was simply laughed at.
M	WESLEY	Every day.
M	SLOAN	Because you use your brain differently than other people. All Fraternity members do.
M	WESLEY	I don't get it.
M	SLOAN	Humans use neurons to think. But most people can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once without suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not us. And not you. We have the ability to think differently than other people.
M	WESLEY	So we set our own rules.
M	SLOAN	That's right. Sloan hands him back the weapon.
M	SLOAN (CONT'D	Try it. Wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him. He ..and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder.
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	Have you ever shot a gun before?
M	WESLEY	Just the flies.
M	SLOAN	So you have no pre-conceived habits we need to break. Shoot the target. Don't hit mom.
M	WESLEY	You mean curve the bullet? How?
M	SLOAN	This isn't about "how." It's about "what." If you'd never been told a bullet flies straight and I handed you this and said hit that target... what would you do? Allow your instincts to guide you. Just like the flies. The technology is only here to assist your natural instinct. Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing...
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	It's not 'will' that makes the physical react how we wish, it's 'control.' You are in control...
M	BAM BAM BAM!	The bullets blast out of the gun, like they are on a .they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2 center of the target! Sloan smiles.
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	Rules are made to be broken, Wesley. No one was better at that than your father. He had a pair of pearl-handled revolvers with which he could conduct a symphony. L i Wesley nods proudly, and squeezes off some more shots,
F	CATHY	Oh my god, Wesley, where have you been? I've been so worried! But Wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw
M	CATHY (CONT'D)	What're you doing? Are you leaving? You .owe rent! But Wesley just keeps packing.
M	CATHY (CONT'D)	You can't leave! This is bullshit, Wesley. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Wesley just zips up his bag and turns back toward the .where Egx is now standing, wearing outf' that would make the devil blush. Who the fuck are you? But Fox doesn't even acknowledge her presence, and just Wesley walks out the door and Fox follows. Cathy chases
M	CATHY (CONT'D)	You're nothing, Wesley! And you will always be nothing! You think you're gonna be happy.with that skank... Uh-oh... Fox stops and turns around -- fisting her pistols. Wesley and Fox keep moving, down the steps. Barry is
F	FOX	You can take the couch until we find you someplace better.
M	WESLEY	Okay. She moves toward a separate bedroom.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Fox? She stops. What was my father like? For a moment, she thinks about it. Then...
F	FOX	Come on.
F	FOX	Your father lov ed you, Wesley. He talked about you all the time.
M	WESLEY	Really? Wesley looks at her hopefully. She smiles, thinking
F	FOX	That's a fact. He knew he wasn't supposed to, but he couldn't help it.
M	WESLEY	You worked with him? He trained me. Made me what I am.
M	FOX (V.0.)	I remember one night he had me on my own .for the first time, and I was tagging this target named Buster Burgess. But I was green and clumsy and stupid. Buster marked me and disappeared into this old tenement building.
M	BAM!	He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls helpless to the
M	FOX (V.0.)	Motherfucker shot mein the leg. Put a damn hole in my favorite skirt. The figure re-aims, ready to take out the helpless Fox.
M	FOX (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Then you know what happened?
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	My father saved your life? Put a bullet in Burgess? k,
M	FOX (V.0.)	Naww. I ended up with four more slugs in me. The figure unleashes four more shots.
M	WESLEY	What kind of training is that?
F	FOX	I'm here, aren't I?
M	INSIDE THE LOBBY:	Wesley weighs all this, puts it together.
M	WESLEY	My father was Burgess, wasn't he? Fox nods, smiling. They step... .andstart riding it up.
F	FOX	He didn't hit me anywhere important, and he used pin-shot bullets that didn't do any real damage. But you can be damn sure I don't let any mark get the high ground on me again. Shesmiles at another thought. And you know what we did instead of go to the hospital to stitch me up?
M	WESLEY	What?
F	FOX	We went driving. Two hands pull her up and drop her in the passenger seat,
M	WESLEY	What's this?
F	FOX	This is where your father was killed. Wesley's eyes narrow and he looks around, taking it all
M	WESLEY	How?
F	FOX	We're not sure. The fence he was meeting was shot in the head... which led him out to here... but it must've been a set-up all along. All I know is it would take a hell of a trap to bring your father down. Wesley crouches down by where his father's body would
M	WESLEY	My whole life I thought he was dead. I shouldn't feel any differently just because it happened 20 years later.
F	FOX	But...
M	WESLEY	But, I do. Like I missed my one chance.
F	FOX	Well that's why you're here. To make up for lost time. Wesley looks back at her.
M	WESLEY	Can I see his body?
F	FOX	We cremate our dead. I'd like to say it's to honor them, but it's mainly to keep anyone from identifying them after they're gone.
M	WESLEY	These are my father's ashes?
F	FOX	Yeah.
M	WESLEY	Sloan said his heart stopped but there was no entry wound?
F	FOX	That's right.
M	WESLEY	Can I have a minute?
F	FOX	Sure. She leaves and Wesley approaches the urn holding his He runs his finger over it, and just when we think he's ..he smashes the urn on to the stand, the ashes spilling Wesley runs his fingers through the decay: what a cremains. But then hisfingegs find something in the dust... a As he studies it, we start to hear... WHAM! WHAMI... Wesley site with his hands tied behind his back, taking
M	THE PHARMACIST	If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one and find yourself the one, remember that each foe will likely move at the same steady speed away from each other, allowing you to keep a gun on each.
M	THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)	Now, if you find yourself one ' on three, that poses a real bit a' ball ache... The sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	There are two kinds of pain. One is an object. A living thing that crawls around the outside of your body. Cuts, broken bones, bruises... all deliver the kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and they soon disappear to nothing but the sound of a gnat in your ear. Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness.
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I've lived with a different kind of pain all my life... the kind that comes from two decades of being passed over, pushed around, ignored. But you can't hide from that kind of pain either... Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face.
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	.because it finds you. He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his
M	SLOAN	Watch the eyes. Look for a slight swelling of the pupil. You can train your body to stay a constant temperature, you can control your heartbeat, but you can't control the center of your eyes. That's how you know when someone is lying to you. Sloan looks right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes, Do you want to fuck Fox?
M	WESLEY	No.
M	SLOAN	I know that's a lie without even seeing your eyes.
M	WESLEY	Fine. Try something else.
M	SLOAN	Okay. What are you hiding from me? Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan.
M	WESLEY	Nothing. Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	You told me to hunt down my father's killer. That's what I'm doing.
M	SLOAN	What's this?
M	WESLEY	The bullet that killed him. You said his heart stopped but there was no entrance wound. This bullet has a hole cut into its center...
M	SLOAN	Yes?
M	WESLEY	You know how a mole buries into the earth by pushing the dirt back around it? I think this bullet does what the mole does... Splits the skin and pushes it back through its center, filling the space it just passed through. Sloan looks at him, like he might have been underestimating him until now.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Fox was telling me that my father used special bullets. It looks like Cross does too... which means these are custom made. If we find who makes them, then we find someone who has access to Cross. Sloan picks up the bullet and leans back.
M	SLOAN	You put this all together on your own? Wesley taps his head.
M	WESLEY	Firing neurons. Whatever happened to my father's guns? The pearl handled ones?
M	SLOAN	Don't know. But whoever has them isn't long for this place. Sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops
M	WESLEY	What's that?
M	SLOAN	Cross. The details of his life. q Continue your hunt.
M	WESLEY	No rules, right? This stops Sloan for a second.
M	SLOAN	No rules. Wesley site up and looks at the binder sitting on the Wesley studies the face, wanting to know every detail. Fox peers out the door and looks at Wesley, watching him
M	SLOAN	We keep a record of every assassination mission, going back to the Ides of March. Maps, diagrams, logistics, complications, weapons of choice... it's all there. Wesley nods, impressed. Sloan just keeps leading him Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the
M	WESLEY	What's all this?
M	SLOAN	Where we plot our local hits. This city is one of the Fraternity's major headquarters.
M	WESLEY	This room. The books. Seems low-tech.
M	SLOAN	Part of mastering technology is knowing when to use it. Models can't be hacked. Your father built this room himself. Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire
M	WESLEY	What's with the red ones? Sloan just smiles... .and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES'IN on Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing particular.
M	SLOAN	The Fraternity's grasp reaches every facet of the world's major cities, including their construction. Look at this streetlight. Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the "Municipal C. W. 63070." But then there is something different on this one... a Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside, Wesley can't believe it.
M	WESLEY	You have stashes...
M	SLOAN	.everywhere.
M	WESLEY	Jesus. Just then, two POLICE OFFICERS walk by, eye.the gun Sloan
M	POLICE OFFICER	Sir... Sloan flashes his tattoo at them.
M	SLOAN	Keep moving, fellas. They nod and do just that. They let us do our jobs, we let them live. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN on Wesley's face as he realizes the GUN RANGE. Wesley firing his Imanishi 18 on the shooting
M	WESLEY	Closer. Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o; him, firing at Wesley smiles, impressed. LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book, century Paris. MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature INTERROGATION ROOM. Wesley sitting here,. being grilled
M	SLOAN	Our job isn't just about how fast or true you shoot, Wesley. Physical agility will always lose to mental agility. It's warfare of the mind. FO 'S APART. Wesley looking at Fox through the SLAUGHTERHOUSE. Wesley working with the Butcher on the MAP ROOM. The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop ROOFTOP. Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that
M	WESLEY	Cross and my father were tight. But Cross thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads. Which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy.
F	FOX	More reason for Cross to die. Wesley flips to the picture of cross.
M	WESLEY	But I don't see jealousy in those eyes, do you? Fox walks over and slams the binder shut.
F	FOX	Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we have to kill Henry Helms. Do-you know who that is?
M	WESLEY	The journalist who's got a price-tag on his head.
F	FOX	A price-tag that we're going to collect. Your father was meeting with a fence about the job when Cross took him down. So we can only assume Cross knows about the target too. We... you... have to take Cross out before we prosecute this mission. We can't have him out there as a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you understand?
M	WESLEY	Yeah.
F	FOX	We've never defaulted on a job and this 1k one won't be the first. Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out Fox leans back, impressed.
F	FOX	May have found your match, Sloan. Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley.
M	SLOAN	Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy the weapon. No other rules. Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns.
M	WESLEY	Close the gap. Push the body closer to the target..
M	THE GUNSMITH	It's already at four feet.
M	WESLEY	Closer.
M	THE GUNSMITH	Here's two. Your father couldn't even do that.
M	WESLEY	Closer.
M	THE GUNSMITH	Wesley, at some point --
M	WESLEY	Closer. I'll say when.
M	WN	Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body, business man!
M	THE GUNSMITH	How you gonna -- ?
F	FOX	Just run it out there. Let the kid work. The Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range.
M	WESLEY	You wanna go first?
M	SLOAN	There are limits to everything, Wesley. At some point the body becomes a shield. Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds, The Gunsmith brings the target back to them...
M	THE GUNSMITH	I guess not every rule can be broken.
M	WESLEY	Check the target. The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	You'll find one entry below the shoulder, missing the major blood vessels there, exiting the back. Second shot went through the abdomen, clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, which is partially protected by the ribcage, and passed through the liver and probably part of the gallbladder. Upper left abdomen is a good place, where number four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street. And finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK." Number five entered the mouth, was redirected downward by the upper jawbone ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's the shot you'll find in the middle of the target. Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Fuck the rules. With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face
M	WESLEY	One! There is a look in Wesley's eye we, haven't seen before, a As he continues to take punches and count them out... Two! (WHAM!) Three! (WHAM!) Four! ..he pulls his arms tight, and his muscles start to The CAMERA PUSHES THOUGH one of the walls...
M	OBSERVATION ROOM:	.. to where Fox and Sloan are watching Wesley pummel the
M	SLOAN	He's ready. the los2k on Fox's face becomes more and more and They unleash on each other, and from the looks of it, Fox
F	FOX	Don't you quit now, baby! Don't you quit now!! Wesley didn't know it could be like this. After they finish, Fox gets up and heads to the shower In the doorway, she turns around...
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Sloan says you're ready.
M	WESLEY	Do you like being the only chick in the Fraternity? Who said I was the only sister? Maybe you just haven't met any others yet. Wesley laughs.
M	WESLEY	Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. Hold still. He settles down.
M	WESLEY	How did you end up here, Fox?
F	FOX	Same way you did, sugar. They found me.
M	WESLEY	What did you do before? Fox looks at him, a wry smile on her face.
F	FOX	Sold perfume. At the mall.
M	WESLEY	No shit?
F	FOX	No shit.
M	WESLEY	I can't see it.
F	FOX	Get in line.
M	WESLEY	What made them come after you? I mean, I know why I'm here.
F	FOX	Fraternity members all have something in their lineage that shows they'll be good at this.
M	WESLEY	And yours is?
F	FOX	My great-great-great-grandfather on my mother's side. He was on a slave ship coming over from East Africa and as it was pulling into Charleston, he killed every white man on the ship and swam to shore. They caught him and hung him four days later.
M	WESLEY	That's terrible.
F	FOX	I Nah. Motherfucker deserved it. Be raped eight women in those four days. One of them was my great-great-great-grandmama. She pushes her chair back, done with her work.
M	WESLEY	Where's the Diablo? I got tired of the color. Wesley can't help but smile, then Fox stops. They're Wesley's father smashed in Fox's story.
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	Being a member of the Fraternity was like winning the lottery... Traffic lights mean nothing, as Wesley mashes the accelerator to the mat, and the Porsche responds, ripping Fox rises up in the passenger seat, looking over the
M	WESLEY.(V.0.)	This... this is what my dad's life was like. He was a fucking god. He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Where we headed?
F	FOX	Trial by fire, sugar. Hook a right. Wesley whips the car around a corner...
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Park it here, baby. He pulls the car to the side of the street... shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people, people. Fox eyes the crowd.
M	WESLEY	You need a new wardrobe or something?
F	FOX	we're here for a reason and it ain't clothes-shopping. Somewhere in that crowd is your first target.
M	WESLEY	A test?
F	FOX	The real thing.
M	WESLEY	Who's the mark?
F	FOX	You'll know him when you see him.
M	WESLEY	What if I don't?
F	FOX	Then you get shot. Fox hands him his Imanishi pistol, which Wesley rolls It's graduation day, baby. I He nods and makes his way toward... .where he quickly mingles with the crowd. He has his Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was attention to what's around him. Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it? ..Wesley gets ready, both hands inside that front pocket... .and now Barry meets his eyes... still coming... still
M	BARRY	Wesley... hey dude. Wesley can't believe itl Thanks for calling me. I wanted to say... Wesley pulls out his gun and Barry throws up his hands...
M	BARRY (CONT'D)	Whoa, man!! But now we see Wesley is looking past B_arry. over his
M	WESLEY	Get down! .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger... Fox holds the clip to Wesley's Imanishi, tapping it in Wesley can't believe his gun is empty. In the split- ...Wesley moves faster than we thought he could move... knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why... He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does, .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming, The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the
F	FOX	Pin shot bullets. Wesley looks down at the gun.
M	WESLEY	Just like my father used on you. Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	You were watching me in the office. Protecting our assets. She hands the clip from the Imanishi over to Wesley...
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Time to do this for real. He holds up the "mole" bullet, and smiles.
M	SLOAN	The mole bullet is made by a midget t Filipino named Pek War. His fingers are so small that they can shape and smooth the metal better than anyone.
M	WESLEY	You've known all along. You knew before I ever broke the urn...
M	SLOAN	I had to let you figure it out for yourself.
M	WESLEY	Part of my training.
M	SLOAN	Part of your quest. To get to know your father. And his killer. Wesley nods, a grave expression on his face, like he Pek War charges exorbitant prices, as much as ten-thousand dollars for a single round, but his craftsmanship is unparalleled. He heads over to Wesley, hands him a slip of paper.
M	'SLOAN (CONT'D)	You can find him at this address.
M	PEX WAR	Andey? He gets no answer. He remains perfectly still, listening.
M	PEK WAR (CONT'D)	Andey?l Two louder THUMPS and a GUNSHOT jerk his head around. Breathing ragged, shimmying across his work space, Pek He gets to it and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal ...but the muzzle off a pistol comes _ uE to the back of his
M	PEK WAR (CONT'D)	Alam man lamangl Alam man lamangl Wesley signals for him to turn around. After he does...
M	PER WAR (CONT'D)	Alam man lamang! Wesley measures him with eyes that have gone hard. Fox
M	WESLEY	There are two things about you I'm sure of right now, little man. One is that you can speak English... Pek War sees that Wesley means business.
M	PER WAR	And what's the other?
M	WESLEY	That my nutsack is bigger than you. Fox snickers. What do you want?
F	FOX	A bullet you made killed his father. The bullet maker looks as though he knew a day like this
M	PER WAR	I only mold the ammunition... I cannot be responsible for the way it is... Wesley SMASHES him in the face with the butt of his gun,
M	WESLEY	Bullshit. You're as responsible as if you pulled the trigger yourself. I didn't... I'm only going to ask you one question and I want you to think very hard how you want to answer. With that, Wesley sticks the stiletto into Pek War's
M	WESLEY	Relax. The blade is in only an inch or so. The little man starts jabbering to God in some foreign
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	See I've learned a thing or two about human anatomy recently. In fact, this blade is stuck just beneath the coastal cartilage of your tenth rib. Just a little push and it will deflate your lung. That's called a pneumothorax. V Helluva way to go, suffocating in a'room full of fresh air. Plus the sound, the sound of all that oxygen hissing out of your lung... pssssssh, like a balloon at a birthday party. Enough to make a man beg for a second chance. But you're only going to have one. Pek War waits, trying not to writhe from the pain...
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	So my question is... how do I find Cross? Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading... My clients use middlemen, I don't meet them in person, I know so little about them... Wesley twitches the handle just a bit.
M	PEK WAR (CONT'D)	Okayl Okayl Dammitl God damiaitl I'll tell you! Wesley lets up a little bit.
M	PEK WAR (CONT'D)	Prearranged meets. Fox snatches up a nearby phone.
M	WESLEY.	Start prearranging.
F	FOX	Wesley, you gotta know something. No matter what kind of training you've done these last few weeks, killing your first, well that's gonna change you forever. Wesley drives for a while. Then...
M	WESLEY	You know what my foster mother. told me when I was six years old? Fox shakes her head.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	She caught me eating some jello out of the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I wasn't supposed to but I was so damn hungry, and it was just some fucking jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard I couldn't bite down straight for a week, she told me... she told me that God had killed my parents because I was such a wicked boy.
F	FOX	Jesus. Someone needs to find that bitch and set her straight.
M	WESLEY	So I grew up thinking I was the reason I never knew my parents. But now, to find out, that no, my father didn't give me up because he had died... he gave me up because he was Protecting me... well I guess I want to give him something back.
F	FOX	Here we are. Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks. Wesley scans the area quickly.
M	WESLEY	Not very discreet, are they? Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley
F	FOX	The others are only backup singers. This is your show. Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear, crouching down. Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a Fox's eyes start to dance.
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Remember: he's good, baby. But you're the best I've ever seen. Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car. From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back. gun... .and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning, Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then

M	WAITER	We need a way in there.
M	ELECTRICIAN	Let's find another door.
M	WESLEY	He'll be long gone by then.
F	FOX	He's got the high ground. Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.
M	WESLEY	On the pallet. They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the Once inside...

M	FOX (CONT'D)	What'd he say to you? Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's
M	WESLEY	He said... he said 'pies on the Fraternity...' Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the
F	FOX	Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of you, baby! Let's go lay this on Sloan!
M	WESLEY	Yeah, sure.
F	FOX	What's wrong?
M	WESLEY	I think I need.a minute to myself. Sure. It's your first kill. I'll wait for you...
M	WESLEY	Naah, that's all right. You need to get stitched up. I'll meet you at that Korean place.
F	FOX	You sure? But he's already walking off. She watches him go, thinking... there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid. words: "I left you something." Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy. Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar because we've seen this place before: it's where he lived when he was a foster kid. He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-

M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Foster home? 4014 The kid nods again. Read this. He tosses the kid the book and heads off. Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean. He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then...
M	ANNA	Come in, Wesley. He stares at her, trying to figure this out. He steps... .and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an
M	ANNA	He's dead, isn't he? There's no point lying to this woman...
M	WESLEY	Yes, ma'am. She nods knowingly, sadly.
M	ANNA	He told me if he didn't come back... it would be you who pulled the trigger.
M	WESLEY	â He killed my father... Anna looks at him, confused. But then, realization sets
M	ANNA	I think you need to meet someone... she leads Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Wesley. This is your brother... Andrew. Wesley's not sure what to make of this.
M	WESLEY	My brother?
M	ANNA	Half-brother. But both of you, you are both 100 percent your.father's boys. I've seen that from the beginning. Andrew is busy playing with a couple of BLACK TOY Your father... he was with you the whole time. Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to. The remarkably... ...photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was- This was his favorite. She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12, Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of FLASH: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery Wesley, thinking, remembering... FLASH: Wesley studying Cross's face in the file, seeing Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by pictures of himself... FLASH: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils. Holy shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	When your father and I found each other, when we had Andrew, he said he could no longer live the way he had been living. He said he wouldn't give us up, the way he had given up his first eon. Wesley stares at the picture... he can't believe he was It was his greatest regret. She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother. down... .but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob
M	ANNA	would you like some coffee?
M	WESLEY	I'm okay. Wesley sets the key down on the table.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Do you know what this opens? A LONE KEYHOLE in a solid closet door. Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open
M	ANNA	I guess it's not much of an inheritance. He left me more than this. Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm.
M	ANNA	I want you to know that he forgave you before you ever pulled the trigger. He tried to keep you out of it for so long...
M	WESLEY	Why didn't he just tell me?
M	ANNA	once they had you... he couldn't risk it unless you were alone. He knew his one shot at telling you might be his last. Her eyes harden a little bit. You have to finish what he was doing, Wesley. It's the only way any of us will ever be free. Especially your brother. They won't stop hunting us... your father knew that. Wesley nods.
M	WESLEY	I'll be back as soon as this is over.
M	ANNA	You have family here. Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him. The place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of
F	FOX	Jesus. She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as For a second there I thought you looked just like Cross. Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table
M	WESLEY	Skipped the hospital?
F	FOX	He picked me clean and I don't care much for needles. She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Sloan's on his way. One of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and
M	FOX (CONT'D)	You want something to eat, baby?
M	WESLEY	I'm all right.
F	FOX	They got some good shit. Ostrich, chicken... won't fill you up too much if you're watching your calories.
M	WESLEY	Naah.
F	FOX	Well, the big man should be here any minute...
M	WESLEY	Yeah. Listen, can I ask you a :question?
F	FOX	Baby, you can ask me anything you want. He focuses on her eyes, zeroing in on the pupils.
M	WESLEY	Did you know Cross was my father?
F	FOX	What?
M	WESLEY	Did you know? Closer, closer... tight on those pupils...
M	O AW	What're you talking about Wesley? Cross killed your father.
M	EXTREME CLOSE-UP:	We see her pupil swell, just a tiny bit. He saw it... exactly what Sloan told him to look for when And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it.
F	FOX	Goddammit, Wesley... She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill
M	FOX (CONT'D)	Why'd you have to ask me that? With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by wouldn't know it. Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a form tackle on to a table... ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH...
M	WESLEY	Arrrh!
F	FOX	You shoulda known better, baby... But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven- With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips restaurant... SSSSSSSSS... Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor shoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists The bullets strike it, sparking, and then BOOM!!!: sweltering fire keeps pouring out! Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of Aaaaahhhh! She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...
M	FOX (CONT'D)	I gotta admit, baby... She starts to squeeze both the triggers...
M	FOX (CONT'D)	I thought we might have a future... But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the Most of Fox's face is blown clean fr her head, and a Wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes, the spume For several moments, there is nothing but darkness and a
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	There's a town in Germany called Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named Hans Koblenz.
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	60 During his life, he was said to have killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community on the Rhine. You want to know how he died? A pair of black bears singled out his house from the entire village, mauled his wife, killed his twin daughters, and then lied in wait for him to get back from the woods. The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he
M	WESLEY (V.0.)	When the hunter opened the door, they ripped his throat out before he could scream.
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	The two bears then curled up on the rug LW in the middle of the floor -- the rug that had once been their father -- and proceeded to bite. each other till they bled to death. Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees
M	WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)	That's a true story. He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper: Sloan folds the paper back up and looks at the blood on

M	WESLEY	My father... he was working on a plan, right?
M	ANNA	I don't know. There was so much he wanted to keep away from us... Wesley moves into Andrew's roan... where the boy is still Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew.
M	WESLEY	Can I see that for a second? The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is

Cross... my fathar... set up Henry Helms as bait, knowing Sloan would use his best men for the job. He was going to take them all out. Wesley looks at it some more.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Only he didn't know where on the route they would try and hit Helms. That's the missing piece he was t rying to figure out.
M	ANNA	Do you know the answer to that? Wesley looks up at her, resolve on his face.
M	WESLEY	No. But I know who does.
M	KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.	A lump in a bed stirs.
M	KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.	The lump stirs a little more... NICOLE, the hot girl from Wesley's office, moves to her She starts to open a cabinet but stops, GASPS and jerks Wesley is-in her kitchen, lust a few-feet away. She

M	WESLEY	It's me, Nicole.
M	NICOLE	What happened to you? Wesley wipes his eyebrow with his thumb, like he's considering what he wants to say next.
M	WESLEY	I asked you once if you thought I was an observant person. She doesn't understand... but suddenly we...

Maybe you just haven't met any others yet..
M	WESLEY	Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. .and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley meant what he said, and we...
M	WESLEY	Sloan didn't just have one person in my office watching me, he had two.
M	NICOLE	What are you talking about?
M	WESLEY	What name do you go by? The Intern? He points at her tattoo.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Because I know you have the mark. Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	Where's the Henry Helms hit going down? Where's Sloan?
M	NICOLE	Sloan's not your biggest problem, fuckface.

F	JANICE	He was aggressive toward me and other employees... a very negative person, extremely negative. I can't even repeat the words that came out of his mouth the day we let him go...
M	WESLEY	Motherfucker. Dispose of the weapon... Me.
M	NICOLE	That's right. And the cops were told to watch this place too. You have nowhere to go. He's smarter than you. He'll feed the cops evidence singling you out for every hit the Fraternity has pulled in the last ten years.
M	WESLEY	I'm only going to ask you one more time. Where can I find him?
M	NICOLE	You won't get to him. You can't. The cops will be here any second! Wesley reaches over- -and cranks up a gas burner, the

M	ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:	The Gunsmith sits, waiting patiently... Sloan watches the Limo starting to approach the bridge.

On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits... .and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of Wesley? The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched The name is Cross. In the distance, the Helms limo moves on, safely.
M	WESLEY	Looks like you missed your chance. Now where is Sloan? The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice.
M	GUNSMITH	You don't understand, man. This ain't about Helms. The Intern told you right where to go... He smiles.
M	GUNSMITH (CONT'D)	.I'm just the decoy. THE CAMERA WHIPS around behind Wesley... to show that And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in She told me that, too. And with that, he rolls the o0 over of , just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash a hail of bullets. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen

M	THE BUTCHER	Like I told you... the blade will always live on.
M	WESLEY	I remember some dumb shit like that coming out of your mouth. Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging .the two men slashing, ducking, and moving in the middle of the street. - Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's
M	THE BUTCHER	I can't see!
M	WESLEY	But you can hear. So hear this: To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice- pick style... Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.
M	WESLEY (CONT'D)	...and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side. He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new predicament... He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end
M	THE PHARMACIST	Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo. And you're in a part of the map with no Fraternity stashes. That's what I'd call a real ball ache. For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black., Wesley smiles.

M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	You once asked why I helped hide you as an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'. Power to become a head of the Fraternity. Power over your father. And ultimately it gave me you: the perfect weapon to kill your father.
M	WESLEY	But now you have to dispose of the weapon.
M	SLOAN	In some ways it pains me to do so. You 460 are like the son I never had.
M	WESLEY	Fuck you. Sloan's eyes narrow.
M	SLOAN	Fine. Keep your worthless dignity. You're still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago. Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs
M	SLOAN (CONT'D)	You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is everywhere. Even if you kill me others will come from other cities to take my place. You'll be hunted your whole life. But that's not gonna happen. Like I told you before, when we are called, death is as certain as the sun. Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men tumbleweed.

Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties, A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.
M	RECEPTIONIST	You're the new guy, huh?
M	WESLEY	Just started last week.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Where'd you move here from?
M	WESLEY	All over the place, really. Nothing too exciting.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Well, welcome to the team. Just watch out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the back first chance he gets. Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.
M	BROKAW	Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes to get to? The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.
M	BROKAW (CONT'D)	Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun bags, I'll give her that. He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space.
M	BROKAW (CONT ' D )	Jim, right?
M	WESLEY	Yes, sir.
M	BROKAW	Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started off on the wrong foot here, but we.have numbers to make and if we don't make those numbers, it's my ass on the line. And if my ass gets chewed out by regional, I can guarantee.that your ass is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm not sure how they ran things... Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and-- Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time .so do we understand each other?
M	WESLEY	Of course.
M	BROKAW	Good boy. With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up
M	WESLEY	You want to take a break with me?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Sure! She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting You know, we don't usually get breaks.
M	WESLEY	Well, you'll find there's nothing "usual" about me. They climb in. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's This life is ours, to make of it what we can. .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot
