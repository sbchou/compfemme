M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	COACH HARVEY	Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the game.
M	MIKE	Just warming up, Coach.
M	COACH HARVEY	First game of the season and the scouts are already lining up. You have half the season I know you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want, Mike.
M	MIKE	That's the plan coach.
M	COACH HARVEY	Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time.
M	MIKE	Hold on. Ed's not here yet.
M	DOM	Who cares? He's the water boy.
M	MIKE	And you suck, Dom, but we're letting you in the picture.
M	COACH HARVEY	Hey! Hey! Knock it off.
M	ED	Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard...
M	COACH HARVEY	...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up.
M	PHOTOGRPAHER	And 3, 2, 1-
M	COACH HARVEY	Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
M	MIKE	Ed, I can't help you with the girls if you keep showing up places dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy. Okay? Dude, don't look now but I think Muffy Campanella is scopin' you hard.
M	ED	For real?
M	MIKE	Smile, pud.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	My bad. Mike?
M	MIKE	Who's that stone cold fox? Oh, it's my girlfriend. I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole scout thing's got me wicked nervous.
M	DOM	I'm dedicating my first basket to you, Scarlet.
M	MIKE	Way you shoot that might be mid- season! Everything cool?
F	SCARLET	Oh yeah. Everything's totally copacetic.
M	MIKE SCARLET	Totally? Totally.
M	COACH HARVEY	Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners get the girls. Losers please themselves!
M	MIKE	Excellent. Gotta run.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	What's wrong? Do you really think Muffy's in to me?
M	COACH HARVEY	Where you going!? O'Donnell!?
M	MIKE	Scar! Wait.
M	MIKE	Today is going to be a good day. I love my job. I am a lucky man. Who's lucky? Mike O'Donnell.
M	ACUPUNCTURIST	Can you feel your Qi flowing freely?
M	ED	I'm not sure if its my Qi or internal bleeding.
M	MIKE	What are you doing now?
M	ED	There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine. Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the rage. Makes you look five years younger.
M	ED (CONT'D)	What's this brown stuff again?
M	ACUPUNCTURIST	Rhinoceros urine. Pure protein.
M	ED	Delish! The girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing.
M	MIKE	Then why are you letting her stick needles in you?
M	ED	Because she's hot. But today's not about me. It's about you becoming the new regional sales manager.
M	MIKE	I better be. I've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company.
M	ED	No negativity. Negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed. You, Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a winner.
M	MIKE	A winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house.
M	ED	Are you kidding?! It doesn't get any better than this! I gotta get back. My legs just went numb. Good luck today.
F	WENDY	Congratulations, Mike. You deserve it. You're like a totally amazing salesman.
M	MIKE	Thanks, Wendy. That like totally means so much to me.
M	ROGER	Good morning, peeps. As you all know, today I'll be naming the new regional sales manager. What's it take to be an RSM? Leadership skills, a comprehensive knowledge of today's prescription pharmaceuticals and most importantly a dedicated soldier.
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	All being said, congratulations- Wendy. Now go out there and sell some drugs peeps!
M	MIKE	How could you do this to me? I've been a salesman here 18 years. Wendy's only been here 2 months!?
M	ROGER	Look, your sales are admittedly better but she has the college degree. What can I do?
M	MIKE	You can give me the promotion, Roger!
M	ROGER	Things have changed. I couldn't even hire you now with only a high school diploma. My hands are tied, bro-ski.
M	MIKE	Alex?
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	The kid's still got it.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Ooooh. That was stupid.
M	MALE VOICE (o.s.)	You know someone in that picture?
M	MIKE	I do. Me. I'm in the center there.
M	JANITOR	Adolescence can be so cruel.
M	MIKE	What are you talking about? I had life by the balls in that picture. Everything was possible. Then a few minutes later, pffffft, all gone.
M	JANITOR	`For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: `It might have been...'
M	MIKE	That'll be my epitaph.
M	JANITOR	We all have regrets.
M	MIKE	Why's it have to be that way?
M	JANITOR	Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Can't hurt to ask. You never know who's listening, Michael.
M	MIKE	How did you know... ...What are you doing, Dad?
M	MIKE	Hey, Guys. I was just talking to-
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Never mind. Sorry I'm late. You ready to get some dinner then?
M	ALEX	Why are you limping?
M	MIKE	Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron.
M	MIKE	I bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start.
M	ALEX	Yeah, me and the guys are running drills, scrimmaging, getting in shape.
M	MIKE	That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are-
M	ALEX	-it's how big you play.
M	MIKE	And what about you, Mags? What's new?
F	MAGGIE	Nothing.
M	ALEX	She got into Georgetown.
M	MIKE	You did!? That's fantastic!
F	MAGGIE	It's no big deal.
M	MIKE	It's a huge deal. That's a great university. I'm proud of you. Am I missing something here?
F	MAGGIE	You wouldn't understand.
M	MIKE	Try me.
F	MAGGIE	I have a lot of emotional stress right now. My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure...
M	MIKE	That's not stress. Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski...
M	ALEX	Did you get the promotion, Dad?
M	MIKE	Still waiting to hear.
M	MIKE	Is your mom home?
M	ALEX	She's probably out back.
M	MIKE	Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound good?
F	MAGGIE	I'm counting down the minutes.
M	MIKE	What's with her?
M	ALEX	We see you once a week for a couple hours. What do you expect?
M	DOM	Hey, Mike. Good to see you. Tough break, you and Scarlet.
M	MIKE	Bite me, Dom.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	A little late for a delivery isn't it?
F	SCARLET	Dom was in the neighborhood. He offered to make a dump run for me.
M	MIKE	Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?
F	SCARLET	What's your point?
M	MIKE	Come on. He's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now.
F	SCARLET	At least someone's after me.
M	MIKE	`In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you.'
F	SCARLET	Please, Mike. This isn't high school. That's not gonna work.
M	MIKE	`Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd, and I'm hungry like the wolf.'
F	SCARLET	You can stop now. It's not working.
M	MIKE	`Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'
F	SCARLET	You no longer have the right to invoke the "wolf."
M	MIKE	Why are you destroying the yard?
F	SCARLET	I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. Thanks for asking.
M	MIKE	Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?
F	SCARLET	I am a landscape designer. Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that's a fair question.
M	MIKE	I didn't get it.
F	SCARLET	I'm sorry. But maybe this is what you needed. Maybe it's time you looked for something else?
M	MIKE	That's a great idea, Scar. Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma.
F	SCARLET	And it's all my fault, isn't it?
M	MIKE	I didn't say that.
F	SCARLET	No, but it's what you think, right?
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	I never asked you to marry me.
M	MIKE	But I did.
F	SCARLET	I'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike, really, I am, but you're not the victim here.
M	MIKE	Jesus!
M	MIKE	Hey!? Get away from there!?
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Oh no!! Hello!? What the-
M	MIKE	Damn it. Ed! Ed! I lost my key!
M	ED	Coming! I've been worried sick! WHERE-
M	MIKE	I've had a really rough night.
M	ED	AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
M	ED	Don't come any closer! I'll use it!
M	MIKE	What are you gonna do? Exfoliate me to death? You got into my samples case again, didn't you?
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	What's your problem, it's only mud. AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	I'm dreaming right? Is this some kind of hallucination? Do something! Anything! Pinch me!
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	I said pinch!
M	MIKE	Calm down! We need to talk! We can work this out! Aye dios mio!
M	ED	Maria, we're just friends. Really.
M	ED	My theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements. I've recreated the exact contents of the LA River. The toxic pollutants, the contaminants.
M	MIKE	Well, it obviously isn't working.
M	ED	That's because the cocktail's not complete.
M	ED (CONT'D)	Last night we had the worst electrical storm of the last hundred years.
M	MIKE	Is that true?
M	ED	It was pretty bad.
M	MIKE	Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you really think this'll work?
M	ED	It could.
M	ED (CONT'D)	Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a moment. What were you doing by the river anyway?
M	MIKE	The janitor!
M	MIKE	Has anyone seen the janitor? Is the janitor here? Where's the janitor?
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you tell me where I can find the night janitor?
M	JANITOR	I'm the only custodial engineer currently employed here.
M	MIKE	There was an old guy, white hair. I showed him this picture of me-
M	JANITOR	-Of you? That picture's from 1989.
M	MIKE	Right. Forget it.
M	VOICE (o.s.)	Can I get a little help in here?
M	MIKE	Alex? What are you doing up there?
M	ALEX	I wanted to see if I could get my nuts into my esophagus. What do you think I'm doing!? Get me down!
M	MIKE	Okay. Okay. I'll get you down.
M	ALEX	How do you know my name?
M	MIKE	I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle Ed's son. He told me to look out for you.
M	ALEX	Uncle Ed has a son?
M	MIKE	Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too. Did those guys do this to you?
M	ALEX	Goons from the basketball team.
M	MIKE	But why?
M	ALEX	Because they can and so they do on a daily basis.
M	MIKE	But you're one of them.
M	ALEX	No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta go.
M	ED	Did you find the janitor?
M	MIKE	He doesn't exist. Nothing makes sense.
M	ED	Did he ask you for your soul?
M	MIKE	No?
M	ED	That's a good sign. We can eliminate Satan. I think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment. "Spell affect"..."casting procedure"...yada, yada, yada. Basically it's a learning spell. There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid. My guess is that janitor was probably a war...
M	MIKE	...I'm going back to high school.
M	ED	...lock. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Because I thought you just said you were-
M	MIKE	Going back to high school.
M	ED	Are you out of your freaking mind!?
M	MIKE	My son was hanging by his underwear from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla. They need me.
M	ED	What about your job?
M	MIKE	Email and telephone. I got it covered.
M	ED	Well, Scarlet, then. What are you gonna tell her?
M	MIKE	Nothing.
M	ED	You're just gonna disappear?
M	MIKE	To be honest, I think she'd rather have it that way. What's with the attitude?
M	ED	Because I know you're going to suck me into this and I'm not going back there, Mike. You'll never get me to go back to Fitch. Never!
M	ED	I hate you.
M	MIKE	Take a deep breath. All you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Are you sure these look legit?
M	ED	Please. I created software used to launch the space shuttle. I think I'm capable of forging some report cards. What's up with the gear?
M	MIKE	This is hip teenage apparel. I got it right off the mannequin at Ed Hardy.
M	SECRETARY	Ms. Goodwin will see you now.
M	ED	First sign this old hag is on to us I'M-
M	ED	-so glad we chose this school. I'm Ed Freedman.
M	JULIE	Nice to meet you. I'm Julie Goodwin, principal here at Fitch Senior High. And you behind there? You are?
M	ED	Oh, right. Sorry. This little chicken pock here is Mark. Say hello, Mark.
M	MIKE	Nice to meet you, Julie.
M	JULIE	Around here you're going to have to use Ms. Goodwin. Please, sit.
M	ED	Before we get started I want you to know that Mark's a bastard.
M	JULIE	Excuse me!?
M	ED	I had him out of wedlock. So the answer is yes, I'm very single...and very rich.
M	MIKE	Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a very successful prostitute.
M	JULIE	O-Kay. Did you bring your transcripts? So the last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut. And you were a straight A student. Very impressive.
M	ED	I help him with his homework...a lot.
M	MIKE	Oh, dad, the doctor called. You were right. It is herpes.
M	JULIE	I think it's time we got Mark to class. Lisa! Lisa!
M	JULIE (CONT'D)	Lisa, will you print out a schedule for Mark and show him to class?
M	LISA	Sure. Come on, Mark.
M	ED	Be a good boy now. And sit up straight.
M	ED (CONT'D)	They grow up so fast. Mojito?
M	JULIE	I beg your pardon.
M	ED	You strike me as a Mojito gal. I know this little Cuban place, great PLANTAINS-
M	JULIE	-Yeah, no. I don't date my students' parents. It's a rule of mine.
M	ED	I'll enroll him somewhere else.
M	JULIE	I really need to get back to work.
M	ED	See you at the next bake sale then?
M	MIKE	Do their mothers know they dress like that?
M	GIRL	Those are the Wonder Bras. Beware.
M	STAN	What did you did do? Mug the mannequin at the Ed Hardy store?
M	JAZZ	Tool!
F	MAGGIE	Oh thank God he's not here. I ran all the way from-
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Why's that freak waving at me. Take your seats. Stop the talking.
M	MR. ADAMS	Here are yesterday's tests. Let's see how you all did.
M	MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)	C-, C, B-, D, D-, F
M	MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)	D for O'Donnell.
M	MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)	Let me guess. Early acceptance? Where are we going?
F	MAGGIE	Georgetown.
M	MR. ADAMS	If you flunk senior calculus you'll be lucky to get into beauty school, missy. So, if you plan on slacking your way through my class, don't. Save your parents tuition money and pick up a blow dryer...
M	MIKE	Enough!
M	MR. ADAMS	Excuse me?
M	MIKE	Do you think humiliating a 17 year- old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it?
M	MR. ADAMS	And you are?
M	MIKE	Mark Freedman. It's my first day.
M	MR. ADAMS	Well, Mr. Freedman-
M	MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)	-you've earned yourself a trip to the principal's office. Welcome to Fitch.
M	MIKE	Is someone barbecuing? YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!
M	MR. ADAMS	Get out, Mr. Freedman!
M	GAYSIAN	Go Hot Pants! Do your dance, Girl!
M	BIGGEST LOSER	Look, we feel your pain. We really do. But life's hard enough, Brother.
F	MAGGIE	What's the big deal? He stuck up for me in class. It was a nice thing to do.
F	SAMANTHA	He was totally sexing on you.
F	LAUREN	He's coming. Pretend you're not here.
M	MIKE	Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls. I'm Mark-
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Girls? Hello? Anyone home?
F	LAUREN	Oh my God. Can't you see we're not here?
M	MIKE	Good. So there's plenty of room then.
F	JAMIE	Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch. How sped. (special ed)
F	SAMANTHA	Look, this table is V.I.P. You're a NIP. What's a NIP?
F	LAUREN	Not Important. Go away.
M	MIKE	Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls?
F	MAGGIE	Listen, I appreciate what you did in class but, I already have a boyfriend.
M	MIKE	You have a boyfriend? Excuse me a second.
F	JAMIE	He still gets calls. How 2007.
F	SAMANTHA	I think my grandfather has that phone.
M	MIKE	Maggie, could we talk somewhere ELSE- Yo! Bro-ski, what are you doing at our table?
F	MAGGIE	Nothing. He was just leaving.
M	MIKE	We should do this again sometime.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Get your hands off her, you little punk!
M	STAN	You gotta problem with me, `bra?
M	MIKE	No, no, I don't.
M	STAN	Now make like Tom and Cruise.
F	MAGGIE	That was so not cool.
M	STAN	What? I'll buy you another ice cream.
M	MIKE	It was terrible. The place is evil, Ed. That building needs to be exorcised.
M	ED	Come on. It couldn't have been that bad.
M	MIKE	My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed and sent to every member of student body.
M	ED	Yeah, I caught it on youtube. Funny stuff.
M	MIKE	They mocked my clothes and phone. My daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and I have mint chip in my ears.
M	ED	High school's great, isn't it?
M	BARTENDER	What can I get you?
M	MIKE	Double scotch neat.
M	BARTENDER	Funny, kid.
M	ED	Get the boy a Shirley Temple. Extra cherries.
M	MIKE	I'm not going back there.
M	ED	Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience. You should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out.
M	MIKE	I know why you're encouraging me all of a sudden.
M	ED	Because I'm a supportive dad.
M	MIKE	Because you want to nail my principal.
M	ED	Did she ask about me?
M	MIKE	She's not your type. She's smart.
M	ED	As far as I can tell that's her only flaw. I need a reason to see her again. You could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalise the place. You'll figure it out. Then I can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son. What do you think?
M	OLDER LADY	I think you should be reported to child services!
M	ED	Mind your business, Lady. This is a family matter.
M	MIKE	I can't do it. I don't have it in me.
M	ED	Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together. He'll be fine. That's what I did.
M	MIKE	You're right! My kids need me.
M	ED	At'a boy. Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in
M	ED	Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas.
M	MIKE	There must be a very hot girl downstairs.
M	ED	There is. What are you doing?
M	MIKE	I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it?
M	ED	Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow?
M	MIKE	I am so ready.
M	ED	That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son.
F	SAMANTHA	Oh my god. Was that-
F	JAMIE	Did you see-
F	LAUREN	I told you he was cute.
M	MIKE	So I've been here a couple days now and I think I got it figured out. You girls are lesbians, right?
M	MIKE	Mind if I sit here?
M	ALEX	Mark? You look totally different.
M	MIKE	I got rid of the bull's eye on my forehead.
M	ALEX	Could you move to the left a little?
M	MIKE	Who's she?
M	ALEX	Nicole Lopez. She's in my Spanish class.
M	MIKE	Have you spoken to her?
M	ALEX	No. I get all stupid so I just stare.
M	MIKE	I'll tell you a funny story. The first time I met your mother I was so nervous-
M	ALEX	My mother?
M	MIKE	What?
M	ALEX	You said, `the first time I met your mother I was so nervous...'
M	MIKE	I did? That's weird. Is your mom hot?
M	ALEX	Dude.
M	MIKE	What's going on tonight? You wanna hang out? Do something?
M	ALEX	Really?
M	MIKE	Yeah you could show me around.
M	ALEX	Cool.
M	MIKE	I'll swing by your house around 7.
M	ALEX	I wouldn't go over there. Stan and his Baboons have lunch this period.
M	MIKE	Don't worry. I'll see you tonight.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Did you girls catch Ellen yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa Etheridge jammed-
F	SAMANTHA	-You're so rude!? We're not gay. We like boys.
F	JAMIE	Yeah, Samantha's a total slu...
F	LAUREN	Last New Year's Samantha made it with my boyfriend.
F	SAMANTHA	I was on like 5 Red Bulls! I can't believe you keep bringing that up.
F	JAMIE	Rad phone.
M	MIKE	I know. I'll text you...NOT. Later...much.
F	SAMANTHA	Like we'd ever give you our numbers.
M	STAN	Heads up!
M	MIKE	Stan. Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name?
M	STAN	You think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are?
F	MAGGIE	Cut it out, Stan. Let's eat.
M	STAN	Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch.
M	MIKE	You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.
M	STAN	You don't know me.
M	MIKE	Oh but I do. All too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team. Dates the pretty girls. High school is your kingdom.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason-
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	I'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Don't hurt yourself big boy.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	
M	MIKE	My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know I'm not planning on going to college.
M	MRS. MENCER	A lot of kids feel that way. Don't be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to take a look.
M	MRS. MENCER (CONT'D)	A good place to start is here... this book has information on every college and university in the country.
M	MIKE	Thanks. Hello?
M	MIKE	It was incredible! I was incredible! You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers!
M	ED	See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office?
M	MIKE	Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy.
M	SCARLET (o.s.)	Coming!
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	I've been dying to meet you. I've known your father since...(gasps)
M	MIKE	Is something wrong?
F	SCARLET	No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please.
F	SCARLET	And you say Ed Freedman is your father?
M	MIKE	That's my dad. All 68 inches of him.
F	SCARLET	You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother?
M	MIKE	My mother...she...she was...a...
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	-a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E;, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now.
F	SCARLET	Oh? I'm sorry.
M	MIKE	I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe?
F	SCARLET	Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that?
M	MIKE	I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town.
F	SCARLET	I'll keep that in mind, Mark.
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager.
M	MIKE	You doing some gardening?
F	SCARLET	I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you.
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some.
M	MIKE	I almost don't even recognize it...er...if I had seen it before I probably wouldn't recognize it.
F	SCARLET	You wouldn't have. It was a disaster back here a few days ago. Obviously I have a lot to do still. I'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here.
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	Then I'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants. I have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there. And I'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one. It'll be a real sanctuary back here.
M	MIKE	It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar.
F	SCARLET	My husband's the only one that ever calls me that.
M	ALEX	Yo, Mark. Let's do this.
M	MIKE	Good luck with the project.
F	SCARLET	Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be home by 10:30.
M	MIKE	How's your mom doing? You know, with your dad not being around and all.
M	ALEX	She doesn't like to show it but I know she's bummed. I think it bothers her more that he hasn't called me or Maggie in a while. Whatever.
M	SAMANTHA'S TEXT	Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but w/e. brb. bk. gtg. ttyl. xo. sam.
M	MIKE	I have no idea what this says?
M	ALEX	It says `What up? Mobbing it to Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be right back. Back. Got to go. Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam.
M	MIKE	Let's hit the beach, wingman.
F	SAMANTHA	We were on his myspace page. There's a picture of him jamming with the Chili Peppers at Coachella.
F	JAMIE	I heard Timbaland wants to produce an album with him.
F	LAUREN	Yeah, but he turned him down to help orphans with Brangelina in Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa.
F	SAMANTHA	Oh my God! I bet he knows Justin.
M	ALEX	This looks boring. Let's go back to my house and play video games.
M	MIKE	What are you so nervous about?
M	ALEX	The beach is for the older, cool kids. I don't belong here.
M	MIKE	What are you talking about? You're a basketball player. You're cool.
M	ALEX	I don't play basketball. I mean, I can play, I just don't play on the team.
M	MIKE	But I thought you were getting ready for the season?
M	ALEX	I never told you that.
F	LAUREN	Here he comes!
F	MAGGIE	Can he be any lamer? Using my little brother to get to me?
F	SAMANTHA	If that boy was an apple he'd be delicious.
M	ALEX	Oh, man. It's her. She's here.
M	MIKE	Who?
M	ALEX	She's so pretty it makes me gassy.
M	MIKE	Calm down. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go over there and introduce yourself-
M	ALEX	She won't like me, Mark. I'm a loser.
M	MIKE	Why? Because Stan says so? You think Stan's a winner? He's going nowhere. You're a great kid. Any girl would be lucky to get your attention.
M	ALEX	Really?
M	MIKE	Really. And right now, there's a girl over there who's dying to meet you.
M	ALEX	Okay. What do I say?
M	MIKE	Just introduce yourself. Then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on. Like if she has big, meaty, man hands tell her she should be a hand model. And don't burp on her.
M	ALEX	I can do that.
F	SAMANTHA	You came! Why don't we take a walk somewhere private and play?
F	JAMIE	I don't think so, Sam. Mark promised me a walk on the beach.
F	LAUREN	Walk with me. I've got less miles on me.
F	NICOLE	Hi.
M	ALEX	Hi, Alex. I'm Nicole.
F	NICOLE	You don't look like a Nicole.
M	ALEX	You have big, meaty man hands. You should be a hand model.
F	NICOLE	Oh my God! Seriously!?
M	GIRL 1	I think he got some on me!
M	ALEX	Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real nervous and I've wanted to talk to you for so long. And Mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but I couldn't find anything because everything's so...perfect.
F	NICOLE	Do you want to sit down, Nicole?
F	MAGGIE	What do you want?
M	MIKE	Stan. Why are you dating him?
F	MAGGIE	Get to the point why don't you?
M	MIKE	I'm serious. He's not a nice guy. Matter of fact he's a jackass.
F	MAGGIE	Don't talk about him like that. You don't even know him.
M	MIKE	I know he bullies your brother.
F	MAGGIE	Stan barely knows Alex exists. We're moving in together after graduation.
M	MIKE	Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you were going to Georgetown?
F	MAGGIE	I'm going to Westwood Community College. Stan and I both are.
M	MIKE	The hell you are, Young Lady! If you think I'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy! I forbid you to see him anymore and that's final!
F	MAGGIE	Who do you think you are!? My father?!
M	MIKE	Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!
F	SAMANTHA	Who's Margaret?
F	LAUREN	He doesn't even know her name.
F	JAMIE	He's so not into her.
F	SCARLET	I haven't heard from him in three weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.
M	ED	He cares.
F	SCARLET	Then where is he?
M	MIKE	What's going on?
F	SCARLET	Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping something off.
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	Our court date is the 27th. If he has anything to say, he can say it then.
M	MIKE	What was that all about?
M	ED	That envelope contains divorce papers.
M	ED (CONT'D)	But what do you care? You're going to college, right? Life's one big panty raid for you.
M	MIKE	I don't know what you're talking about?
M	ED	I saw the applications in your room.
M	MIKE	You went through my room!?
M	ED	If you'd cleaned like I asked I wouldn't have had to. You can't be serious about this can you?
M	MIKE	I have to face the possibility that I might never turn back and if that's the case, I'm going to do it right this time around.
M	ED	Karmically speaking, in the next life you're coming back as a hemorrhoid.
M	ED (CONT'D)	I'm not paying for college!
M	STAN	You like her, don't you?
M	MIKE	Who?
M	STAN	My girlfriend. She told me you were trashing me at the beach.
M	MIKE	Leave her alone, Stan. She's a good kid.
M	STAN	I don't know how good she is yet but after I find out, she's all yours.
M	MR. ADAMS	Settle, people.
M	MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)	This was your homework. Who can come up here and solve this for me? Anyone?
M	MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)	Not one person. Fine. Miss O'Donnell. Come up here and dazzle us with your brilliance.
M	STAN	Stuck!!! I'm stuck! My fingers!
M	MR. ADAMS	Sit down, Stan! Sit down!
M	STAN	It's glue! I'm glued to everything!
M	JAZZ	I'll get it off!
M	STAN	No! No! Don't pull--!
M	ALEX	I got your text. What's so important?
M	MIKE	This year you're making the team. We practice everyday `til try outs. That gives us a week and a half.
M	ALEX	Forget it.
M	MIKE	Yeah, you're right. You probably don't have any skills anyway.
M	ALEX	Hey! I got skills.
M	MIKE	So what's your problem? Is it Stan and his friends?
M	ALEX	Just leave it alone.
M	MIKE	You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex.
M	ALEX	I'm too small anyway.
M	MIKE	That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot. Remember, it's not how big you are-
M	ALEX	-it's how big you play. Where did you hear that?
M	MIKE	I don't know? Read it somewhere I guess. Be a sport. Show me what you got.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Alright. You got a little game.
M	STAN	What are you 2 queers doing in my gym?
M	MIKE	Let's go, Alex.
M	STAN	I don't think so. You girls wanna play with the boys then let's play. 2 on 2.
M	MIKE	We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs.
M	STAN	Come on, Ally. Embarrass me.
M	MIKE	Back off, Stan.
M	ALEX	It's okay. I got him.
M	STAN	You ready? Here it comes.
M	STAN (CONT'D)	2 points! And I was fouled!
M	COACH HARVEY	Hey! That's enough! That's enough!
M	ALEX	My mom's been in there a while. She's gonna be pissed.
M	MIKE	Act like you're hurt and she won't be able to stay mad at you.
M	ED	Way to go, slugger! Get any shots in?
M	SECRETARY	Mr. Freedman, your son has a black eye.
M	ED	Wuss!
M	ED (CONT'D)	Hey, Alex. How you doin', buddy?
M	ALEX	I'm okay I guess.
M	ED	Good. Good. Nice goin'. How do I look? Anything in my teeth? How's my breath?
F	SCARLET	Ed.
M	ED	Hey, Scarlet. Exciting, isn't it? My first parent/principal conference.
F	SCARLET	Fighting? What's gotten into you?
M	ALEX	I can't talk, Mom. My jaw.
F	SCARLET	My poor baby. And how about you, Mark? Ouch. You poor thing. Does it hurt?
M	MIKE	Not anymore. You smell great.
F	SCARLET	Alex, I'll meet you at the car. I need to talk to Uncle Ed for a second.
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	Did you give him the divorce papers?
M	ED	I sent them to him.
F	SCARLET	Is it another woman? I can handle it. Tell me the truth.
M	ED	I haven't heard from him, really.
F	SCARLET	Okay. If you do, please have him call home. For the kids...I'm running out of excuses-
M	ED	I'll tell him. I promise.
M	JULIE	Ed, come on in.
M	ED	I'll take it from here.
M	ED (CONT'D)	I'm heartbroken. The boy's incorrigible.
M	JULIE	Look, if it was only one isolated fight it wouldn't distress me all that much. Boys will be boys. But, it's also been brought to my attention that Mark may have Krazy glued a boy to his chair.
M	ED	My son? Mark! Get in here! Now!
M	ED (CONT'D)	Did you glue a boy to his chair?
M	MIKE	No.
M	ED	See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables-
M	MIKE ED	He shaves his back. He sucks his thumb.
M	MIKE ED	He wears girls underwear. He wets his bed.
M	JULIE	Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to be the new kid but if I have anymore trouble from you, you'll be facing detentions or worse. You can go now.
M	ED	He's crying out for help and I don't know what to do. It hurts so bad. Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas?
M	JULIE	Let's give him time to figure it out on his own. If the situation gets worse then we'll take the next step.
M	ED	You're the expert. I'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind.
M	MIKE (o.s.)	Got an extra pair of gloves?
F	SCARLET	Gloves are for sissies.
M	MIKE	Yeah, but I just had a manicure.
F	SCARLET	You're serious? You want to help?
M	MIKE	Are you kidding? I love landscaping! It's right up there with watching "Sex and the City" and snuggling.
F	SCARLET	Mark, I'm 36 years old-
M	MIKE	I'm just doing this to make a few bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.
F	SCARLET	Embarrassing. Sorry. I'll give you 10 dollars a day.
M	MIKE	Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that rate I should be able to buy tickets in...2011.
F	SCARLET	Fine. 20. Grab a roll.
M	MIKE	What are the benefits like here?
F	SCARLET	I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.
M	MIKE	Deal.
M	MIKE	Maggie? What do you want? To rub it in my face? Say I told you so?
M	MIKE	You lost me?
F	MAGGIE	Stan dumped me.
M	MIKE	What happened? What did he do? You didn't...
F	MAGGIE	My mom was working last night. Stan came over with a box of-
M	MIKE	Your next word better be `cookies' or you're in big, big trouble!
F	MAGGIE	What am I going to do? I can't live without him.
M	MIKE	Maggie, did you two...you know...do...
F	MAGGIE	Do what?
M	MIKE	That thing...that rabbits do a lot of and that a girl your age should never do and should only do when she's married.
F	MAGGIE	Sex? No, that's why he dumped me!
M	MIKE	There, there now. It's okay.
F	MAGGIE	Sure he was a jerk but he was there for me. Which is more than I can say for any other man in my life.
M	MIKE	When you're young everything seems like the end of the world. But it's not. It's just the beginning. And you might have to meet a few more jerks, but one day you'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated...like the sun rises and sets with you.
F	MAGGIE	You really think so?
M	MIKE	I know so.
F	MAGGIE	You're so sweet.
M	COACH HARVEY	That makes 11-3. Game over. Gather up.
M	COACH HARVEY (CONT'D)	You've gotta little bit of your old man in you, O'Donnell.
M	COACH HARVEY (CONT'D)	As you all know due to the amount of seniors coming back I only have 2 open spots on the roster. It's Freedman and O'Donnell. The rest of you hit the showers.
M	ALEX	Wooo! We did it, Mark! We did it!
M	MIKE	You killed it out there!
M	COACH HARVEY	Son, I don't know where you came from but you just made my year.
M	ALEX	Mom! Mom! I'll be right out, Honey!
M	MIKE	I got'a use the bathroom.
F	SCARLET	Mark? I didn't know you were there.
M	MIKE	I'm sorry. You just look so beautiful.
F	SCARLET	Thank you.
M	MIKE	Can I zip you up?
F	SCARLET	I'm wearing a sweater.
M	MIKE	Your jeans?
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Stupid, idiot, stupid.
M	MIKE	Maggie, what...
F	MAGGIE	Shhh. I get it now. Why you didn't want me to be with Stan, the nice things you said in the library. It's because you wanted me.
M	MIKE	Maggie, listen to me. I'm not the person you think...
F	MAGGIE	Shhh. Yes, you are. You're a good guy. You're not like the others.
M	MIKE	That's right! I'm not like the others. I'm very different than the others. So different that you and I can never be...
F	MAGGIE	What are you trying to say? Are you..."confused"?
M	MIKE	Yes! Yes! That's it. I'm confused. Extremely confused.
F	MAGGIE	Ohmygod! It all makes sense now! Your hair. The highlights.
M	MIKE	What? No-no-no-no. I'm not gay. I'm...I've been in love with the same girl since I was 17.
F	MAGGIE	Who is it? Does she go to our school? Do I know her?
M	MIKE	No, you don't. Now- -if you don't mind?
F	MAGGIE	Tell your girlfriend she better keep a close eye on you.
M	MIKE	Who you texting?
M	ALEX	My dad. I have to tell him about today. Did you just get a text?
M	MIKE	Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll just call him back.
F	SCARLET	So? What happened? Tell me. Tell me. I'm dying to hear.
M	ALEX	I did it. I'm a Falcon! The first game's in 2 weeks.
F	SCARLET	Oh my God, Alex! That's so incredible!
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	I'm so happy for you. And now I want to show you guys something. Ta da!
M	MIKE	You hung the lights!
F	SCARLET	I wanted you to be the first to see it.
M	ALEX	Mom, it's sick.
M	MIKE	It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm sorry I never saw how talented you are...I mean when people see this and how talented you are you'll be designing sanctuaries all over the city.
F	SCARLET	Thank you.
M	ALEX	Mom, why are you all dressed up?
F	SCARLET	Oh my God. I almost forgot. I have a date.
M	MIKE	Let's see who the lucky guy is.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	I knew it!
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	I knew you had a thing for him! You can't do this! You took vows. What kind of example are you setting for the kids!?
F	SCARLET	Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But I'm too old for you.
M	DOM	Wow. You look absolutely ravishing.
M	MIKE	Keep it in your pants, Casanova.
F	SCARLET	Don't mind him. You all set?
M	DOM	Let's do it.
M	DOM (CONT'D)	Hey, kid...if the vans'a rockin'...well you know the rest.
M	MIKE	Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live!
M	ALEX	It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad.
M	MIKE	It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats. You need to talk to her.
M	ALEX	My mom's been pretty sad the past few months. She deserves to be happy. My dad obviously is...wherever he is.
M	MIKE	Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be.
M	ALEX	No, my dad's not a family guy. This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he'd never make it to a game.
M	MIKE	Then why would you tell him that?
M	ALEX	I guess I was hoping it would make him like me more.
M	MIKE	My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed.
M	ED	What about college?
M	MIKE	I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family back. You're not gonna wear that, are you?
M	ED	Baby's got back. Now that Julie's agreed to go out with me tonight, I need you to start behaving. I can't have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate.
M	MIKE	Fine. I want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate Alex making the team. Is that cool?
M	ED	Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I remember hearing what those parties were like, kids peeing everywhere, food on the ceilings, puke in the pool.
M	MIKE	Listen to you. You sound like an old man.
M	ED	No party. I mean it. Don't make me take the car away.
M	MIKE	Don't treat me like a child, Ed.
M	ED	I won't when you stop acting like one.
M	SALESMAN	Sir! Please!
M	ED	This isn't over...son!
M	MIKE	Not even close...Dad!
M	MIKE'S TEXT	Party at my house 2nite. 7. Get the word out.
M	MIKE	Give me that!
M	WONDER BRAS (O.S.)	Hey, Sexy.
M	MIKE	I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex?
F	SAMANTHA	Dance with us!
F	LAUREN	Nambib-bib-ib, that African country makes me horny.
F	JAMIE	Perfect, aren't they?
F	SAMANTHA	Which one of us is it gonna be?
M	MIKE	I thought you girls wanted to dance? The Bras back up. Party-Goers stop what they're doing and
M	STAN	I was upset. I'm sorry. But I need you to show me you love me. Then we'll move in together.
F	MAGGIE	Whatever. I'm with someone else now.
M	STAN	Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid enough?
F	MAGGIE	Him.
M	MIKE	Party's over, Stan. You're out of here.
M	STAN	Who's gonna make me leave? You?
M	MIKE	I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it.
M	STAN	You can have the nun. She doesn't put out anyway.
M	MIKE	On second thought-
M	HOSTESS	There you are, Mr. Freedman.
M	ED	Thanks. Put this towards your studies.
M	JULIE	When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Ed.
M	ED	Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am?
M	JULIE	As long as we're on the same page.
M	WAITER	Good evening. Would you care to see the wine-
M	ED	Bring us the 1962 Petrus.
M	ED (CONT'D)	You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle.
M	JULIE	I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark?
M	ED	It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?
M	JULIE	You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you?
M	ED	Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.
M	JULIE	You're disgusting, Ed.
M	ED	What? You don't like Beluga? You can get something else.
M	JULIE	I'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine.
M	ED	Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo?
M	JULIE	I came here because I'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark. All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are.
M	ED	I do care about Mike...Mark. Whatever his name is.
M	JULIE	You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet. But you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems. Instead it made you just like them. I have to go.
M	ED	Wait. You're right. I'm acting like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please stay.
M	JULIE	Act normal or I'm leaving.
M	MIKE	I had the craziest dream. I was 17 again and back in high school. It was horrible, Scarlet- Scarlet!?
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	You wanna play? Okay, let's play. I'm the hungry lioness and you're a baby gazelle.
M	MIKE	Wait! This is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional. Listen to me, Maggie. I'm your father.
F	MAGGIE	And I've been a bad, bad girl, Daddy.
M	ALEX	How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time she rolls her r's she spits all over me.
M	ALEX	Mike, I blew it! I totally blew it!
M	MIKE	Blew what? What happened?
M	ALEX	She wanted me to kiss her but I panicked. I didn't know if I should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue I'm supposed to use-
M	MIKE	Slow down. Have you ever kissed a girl before?
M	ALEX	Not a real one. I used to practice on my dad's Playboys.
M	MIKE	How did you find...forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like THIS-
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	-hold her still as you adjust your head, close your eyes and kiss her. The rest happens naturally.
M	BOY	That is so wrong.
M	ALEX	What if I, you know, pitch a tent?
M	MIKE	If you feel it, you know, getting angry, take a step back. Now go get that kiss.
M	ALEX	Nicole.
F	NICOLE	I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-
M	SAMANTHA'S TEXT	911. ^stairs. mastr b-room.
F	SAMANTHA	We decided not to make you choose.
F	JAMIE	You can have all 3 of us.
M	MIKE	Girls, if I was 20 years younger I'd...probably only last 10 seconds anyway. Put your clothes back on.
F	SAMANTHA	Was he crying?
M	ED	God's honest truth. I had the whole costume. I used to go everywhere dressed like a wizard. No wonder I didn't get a date all through high school. Annnnd you think I'm the biggest nerd ever.
M	JULIE	No, no, really. I don't. Hark! Who goes there?
M	ED	Tis I. The Wizard they call Marius. And who might you be fair maiden?
M	JULIE	Tis I! Elf Princess Ariala of Jamroar.
M	ED JULIE	NO WAY! YES WAY!
M	ED JULIE	Level 10. Mage. Level 15. Bitch!
M	ED	Check please!
M	MIKE	I'm so dead.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Oh no! Scarlet, what are you doing here?
F	SCARLET	I'm looking for Alex. It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone. Is he here?
M	MIKE	Yeah, he's fine. He's with his girlfriend.
F	SCARLET	Alex has a girlfriend? He does and she's really cute. Come on.
M	JULIE	How did you get your hands on the 5th edition? That's not due out for another three years.
M	ED	I have two words for you. Russian mafia.
M	JULIE	Drive faster.
M	JULIE (CONT'D)	Calm thyself, Marius.
M	ED	That little-! I'll kill him!
M	KID	It's Ms. Goodwin! Run!
M	ED	Everybody out! Get out! Get out!
M	JULIE	This party is over! If you don't want to spend the next 3 months in detention you will leave...now!
M	ED	Do you know where Mark Freedman is?
M	GIRL	I think I saw him go outside.
F	MAGGIE	Have you seen Mark?
F	SAMANTHA	We're looking for him too.
F	SCARLET	He's like a totally different person.
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	It's been so good for him to have you around. You have no idea.
M	MIKE	Believe me, I do. He's a great kid. And you're an amazing mother.
F	SCARLET	I'm not so sure. I mean look at me. I showed up at a party to drag my son home. Could I be any more embarrassing? And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off?
M	MIKE	Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't blame yourself for his stupidity.
F	SCARLET	I knew he was unhappy. I knew he hated his job. I should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. He gave up a lot for me.
M	MIKE	That's bull shit! You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me...him. He was just too selfish to recognize it. At least, that's how I see it.
F	JAMIE	He's over there. By the pool.
F	SAMANTHA	Who's the ho?
F	MAGGIE	Mom?
M	ALEX	Whoa. What's my mom doing here?
F	SCARLET	You're sweet. I have no idea why I'm telling you all this. There's just something so familiar...
M	SCARLET (CONT'D)	What do you think you're doing!?
M	MIKE	Scar, just calm down. I have something to tell you but I need you to keep an open mind. Can you do that for me?
F	SCARLET	This conversation is over, Mark.
M	MIKE	I'm not Mark.
F	SCARLET	I'm not in the mood for games.
M	MIKE	It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike. It's me...your husband.
F	SCARLET	What? Why would you say that?
M	MIKE	It's the truth. I'm the father of your children. You have to believe me.
F	SCARLET	Don't ever come near me or my family again. If you do, I'll have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized.
M	MIKE	Let me explain, Scar.
F	SCARLET	Your son needs a shrink!
F	MAGGIE	Pervert!
M	MIKE	Alex, wait. Let me explain-
M	ALEX	How could you do this to me?
M	ED	This place is a disaster! A kid pissed all over my English garden! What were you thinking!?
M	MIKE	She hates me, Ed. I've ruined everything.
M	JULIE	Who hates him? What's going on?
M	ED	Oh boy. I don't quite know how to put this.
M	JULIE	Try being honest.
M	ED	He's not really my son. I don't have a son.
M	JULIE	Mark's obviously having a crisis and you...you insensitive bastard, you disown him? He'd be better off with his mother in Thailand.
M	ED	Should I call you?!
M	ED	Come on. It's been 2 days. Open up.
M	ED	Jesus. It smells like Jeffrey Dahmer's kitchen in here.
M	ED (CONT'D)	Are you alright?
M	MIKE	I really messed up. I've lost my family.
M	ED	That's not true. Nothing's ever truly lost.
M	MIKE	What about you and Julie?
M	ED	Oh, that? That's lost.
M	MIKE	Sorry about the party. I'll pay for any damages.
M	ED	Don't worry about it. My spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so we're good. I don't mean to rub salt in your wounds but-
M	ED (CONT'D)	-you're due in court in an hour.
M	BAILIFF	-the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?
F	SCARLET	I do.
F	JUDGE	You've requested a divorce by the State of California citing irreconcilable differences. Is this correct?
F	SCARLET	Yes, your Honor.
F	JUDGE	Is Michael O'Donnell or his representative present?
F	SCARLET	No, your Honor.
F	JUDGE	Then I take his absence as agreement to the orders of the divorce. Let's proceed. You're not asking for alimony or child support?
M	JULIE	No, your honor.
M	ED	What exactly are we doing?
M	MIKE	I don't know. We just need to stop her from going through with it!
M	ED	A well thought out plan. Good job.
F	JUDGE	The mother will have full custody of the children. The father will have visitation rights of one weekend a month-
M	ED	I declare a mistrial on the grounds of insufficient evidence and Sacco and Vanzetti!
F	JUDGE	Sacco and...what are you....who are you!?
M	ED	I am legal counsel for Mike O'Donnell and I demand a stay of execution for this marriage, your Majesty.
F	SCARLET	He's my husband's best friend.
F	JUDGE	Are you a lawyer, best friend?
M	ED	No but I have been a defendant in numerous lawsuits so-
F	JUDGE	Bailiff! Get these 2 out of my courtroom.
M	MIKE	Your Honor! I have a letter from Mike O'Donnell. Just let me read it. Please.
F	JUDGE	I'm sorry, but-
F	SCARLET	If it's okay, your Honor. I'd like to hear it.
F	JUDGE	Make it quick.
M	MIKE	Thank you, your Honor. September 7th, 1988 was the first time I saw you. You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never seen anything so perfect. I remember thinking I had to have you or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have. You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because I had you. And then I grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. But I was never lost. I'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. And I never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me. And at that dance you said you loved me. And as I stand here...as I write this, I want you to know if I don't have you I'll die...not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have....oh and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'.
F	JUDGE	Alright, son, you have to go now.
M	JUDGE (CONT'D)	Let's proceed.
F	SCARLET	Your Honor, Sir. I'm sorry. I'm in no shape...I need to postpone...I'm sorry.
M	ED	Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment.
M	MIKE	What are you talking about?
M	ED	According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back. That speech should've broken the spell.
M	MIKE	Enough with the magic crap, Ed. You know what this means? You need to let them go. You need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours.
M	ED	Where you going?
M	MIKE	I'm moving on. See you at the game.
M	COACH HARVEY	Hey, Freedman, save some for the game.
M	MIKE	Just warming up, Coach.
M	COACH HARVEY	Son, I haven't seen anyone with your shooting ability in, well, in a long time. I called a couple college scouts I know. They're coming to the game tonight...to watch you. If you have half the season I think you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want.
M	MIKE	That's the plan, Coach.
M	COACH HARVEY	Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time.
M	PHOTOGRPAHER	
F	MAGGIE	I thought he was hanging out with Alex to get to me- not you.
M	COACH HARVEY	Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
M	MIKE	ALEX-
M	ALEX	I have nothing to say to you.
M	MIKE	I never meant to hurt you-
M	ALEX	Then why'd you kiss my mom!?
M	MIKE	Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know. I'm sorry.
M	ALEX	You're lucky I don't punch you out.
M	ED	Julie, can I talk to you?
M	JULIE	What is it, Ed?
M	ED	I've seen a good friend of mine lose everything that means anything to him. And maybe we'll never be there but...I just really want to play D & D with you.
M	JULIE	You can raid my dungeon anytime.
M	ED	I'll bring my long bow.
M	COACH HARVEY	Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners get the girls. Losers please themselves!
M	REFEREE	Son! Come back here! You're gonna get a delay of game!
M	COACH HARVEY	This can't be happening again.
M	MIKE	It's your turn now. Good luck.
M	COACH HARVEY	Get off your butt, O'Donnell! Get in there!
M	MIKE	Scar!
F	SCARLET	What took you so long?
M	MIKE	The best choice I ever made was you.
F	SCARLET	How did this happ-
M	MIKE	Don't ask. I think it's best if we don't tell the kids about this. Especially Maggie.
