M	DAVID	I don't know.

M	STEPHAN	Usually.
M	DAVID (V.O.)	The station's guarded at all times... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 29.

F	RACHEL	Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals."
M	STEPHAN	What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs.
F	RACHEL	I don't know. I'm waiting to find out.
M	STEPHAN	Youth...
F	RACHEL	What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal?
M	STEPHAN	Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 33.

M	DAVID	This is it.
F	RACHEL	This is it? This is all you want?
F	RACHEL	Seriously, what do you want out of life?
M	DAVID	I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth.
M	DAVID	And...I want another drink.

M	VOGEL	Are your periods irregular?
F	RACHEL	Yes.
M	VOGEL	Yes. I think we've found the problem.

M	STEPHAN	Fuck!
M	VOGEL	Why don't you just kill me now?
M	VOGEL (CONT'D)	How can you keep me waiting to die like this!
M	VOGEL	I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands. But that isn't true. There will be blood on your hands. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 61.

M	VOGEL (CONT'D)	Boo. Yes. Do you know why it was easy to exterminate you people? Your weakness. I saw it. Every day I saw it. Every one of them, thinking only of how to avoid being flogged, or kicked, or killed. Only thinking of themselves. Why do you think it only took four soldiers to lead a thousand people to the gas chambers? Entire families? Because not one, out of thousands, had the courage to resist, the courage to be the first to fall. Not one would sacrifice himself. Even when we took their children from them.
