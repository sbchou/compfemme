M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous. I hope it's okay for me to think that. You see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and I really need to turn things around this year. So, I have a plan.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...
M	SENIOR BULLY	Hop, freshman toads. Hop! Move it, boys!
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	... 1,385 days from now.
M	LINEBACKER	Man, you got big.
M	NOSE TACKLE	Worked out all summer. Rock hard, dude.
M	BRAD HAYS	Would you guys get a room?
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Just 1,385 days.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club.
F	CANDACE	Seniors only. What are you doing with a plastic spork?
M	DEREK	I don't want to bring back silverware--
F	CANDACE	Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer. When my sister said no, I thought maybe my old friend Susan would want to have lunch with me.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around, but now she doesn't like to say hi to me anymore.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And then there's Brad Hays, who's the quarterback of our team. Before my brother went to play football for Penn State, he and Brad played together. So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am I kidding?
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	On the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil.
M	PATRICK	Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I learned that in 'Nam back in '68. "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks." But you know what happened? That prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whorehouse.
M	MR. CALLAHAN	I heard you were going to be in my class. Are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
M	PATRICK	My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick or you call me nothing.
M	MR. CALLAHAN	Okay... Nothing.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything. He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better.
M	MR. CALLAHAN	Everyone open your safety guides. Nothing... why don't you read first?
M	PATRICK	Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big. Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should read on.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	My last class of the day is advanced English, and I'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school...
M	SMART ASS FRESHMAN	Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.
M	BILL	Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?
M	BILL (CONT'D)	I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book. Anyone?
M	BILL (CONT'D)	He's British. He also invented the serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence, the term cliffhanger. Anybody?
M	FRESHMAN GIRL	Shakespeare.
M	BILL	That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? The author was... ... Charles Dickens. However, if you and I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can you imagine that? We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office. And that's where we get the term... anyone? "Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!"
M	BILL	I'll give you a free "A" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right.
M	BILL (CONT'D)	Box office.
M	BILL	You should learn to participate.
M	BILL (CONT'D)	Why didn't you raise your hand? They call you teacher's pet? Freak? I used to get spaz. I mean, come on, spaz?
M	BILL (CONT'D)	So, I heard you had a tough time last year. But they say if you make one friend on your first day, you're doing okay.
M	CHARLIE	Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing.
M	BILL	Yeah. I could see that.
M	CHARLIE	Don't worry, Mr. Anderson. I'm okay.
M	PATRICK	I would happily not take shop...
M	SENIOR BULLY	Hey, Freshman Toad.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just so I say it to someone, high school is even worse than middle school.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	If my parents ask me about it, I probably won't tell them the truth because I don't want them to worry that I might get bad again.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could talk to her. And I know she would understand how I am both happy and sad, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be. I just hope I make a friend soon. Love always, Charlie. Charlie, come on.
M	DEREK	Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
M	MOTHER	Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite. He was a little nervous about starting high school, so I made it.
M	FATHER	You feel a little silly being nervous now, huh, champ?
M	CHARLIE	Yes, sir. I sure do.
M	FATHER	I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be yourself. That's how you--
F	CANDACE	"--make friends in the real world."
M	FATHER	You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
M	DEREK	Freshman year is tough, but you really find yourself.
M	FATHER	Thanks, Derek.
M	MOTHER	I think you could be a little nicer to Derek.
M	FATHER	I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy. I can't stand him.
M	DEREK	I hope you love the mix I made. The cover is hand-painted.
F	CANDACE	Charlie, do you want this?
M	CHARLIE	Are you sure?
F	CANDACE	He gives me one every week.
M	DEREK (V.O.)	Hey, Babe. This next one might be a little sad, but it reminded me of your eyes.
M	SMART ASS FRESHMAN	Did you already do the term paper on To
M	PATRICK	Come on Devils! Woooooo!
M	TWIN SENIOR GIRLS	Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.
M	PATRICK	Suck it, virginity pledges!
M	CHARLIE	Hey... Patrick.
M	PATRICK	Hey! You're in my shop class, right? How's your clock coming?
M	CHARLIE	My dad's building it.
M	PATRICK	Yeah. Mine looks like a boat. You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends?
M	CHARLIE	No. I'll sit if that's okay.
M	PATRICK	Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by the way. It's an endless nightmare. And these assholes actually think they're being original.
M	CHARLIE	So, uh... you like football?
M	PATRICK	Love it.
M	CHARLIE	Then, maybe you know my broth--
M	PATRICK	Hey, Sam.
F	SAM	Question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting?
M	PATRICK	Yes, they call it the men's room.
F	SAM	Well, I finally got hold of Bob.
M	PATRICK	Party tonight?
F	SAM	No. He's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden.
M	PATRICK	He's never tossing that salad.
F	SAM	Patrick... who's this?
M	PATRICK	This is...
M	CHARLIE	Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis.
M	PATRICK	Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?
M	CHARLIE	Is that what they call him?
F	SAM	Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone. You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.
M	PATRICK	I try, Sam. I try.
F	SAM	It's nice to meet you, Charlie. I'm Sam.
M	PATRICK	So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house?
F	SAM	Can't. She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's just go to Kings.
M	PATRICK	Hey... we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come.
F	SAM	Do you have a favorite band?
M	CHARLIE	I think The Smiths are my favorite.
F	SAM	Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths! The best breakup band ever. What's your favorite song?
M	CHARLIE	Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
M	PATRICK	That works on so many levels.
M	CHARLIE	I could make a copy for you.
F	SAM	Thanks. What about Eide's? You love Eide's, right?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. They're great.
M	PATRICK	Not a band, Charlie.
F	SAM	It's an old record store downtown.
M	PATRICK	I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So, watch out, Charlie. She'll ruin your life forever.
M	CHARLIE	That's okay.
M	NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKER	Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.
M	PATRICK	Let it go! Jesus! It's an old joke! It's over!
F	SAM	So, Charlie... what are you going to do when you get out of here?
M	CHARLIE	My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about.
F	SAM	You could write about us.
M	PATRICK	Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon. Make us solve crimes.
M	CHARLIE	You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? What?
F	SAM	He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago.
M	PATRICK	But Sam's not bitter. Make no mistake.
F	SAM	Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic. I'm a bulim-ist. They laugh at their inside joke. Charlie has no idea what's
M	CHARLIE	I'm sorry. I don't know what that means.
M	PATRICK	She just really believes in bulimia.
F	SAM	I love bulimia.
M	PATRICK	Thanks for paying, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey... maybe I'll see you around in school?
F	SAM	God, would you turn that down? You're going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.
M	PATRICK	Bye, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Okay. Bye.
M	DEREK (O.S.)	I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it. Please talk to me. Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive us to our hair appointment" contest. Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.
M	DEREK	There's nothing I can do--
F	CANDACE	Do you always want to be a mama's boy?
M	DEREK	I am not a mama's boy--
F	CANDACE	Yes! You are! Every time I go to your house--
M	DEREK	Shhh. Shut u--
F	CANDACE	-- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself." She's only 51.
M	DEREK	SHUT UP, CANDACE!
F	CANDACE	And you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
M	CANDACE (CONT'D)	Charlie, just go. I can handle it. Just don't wake up mom and dad.
M	MOTHER (V.O.)	Hey, look who's here...
M	LITTLE CANDACE	Welcome home, Aunt Helen!
M	AUNT HELEN	Oh. Look at you all, dressed so nice.
M	CHARLIE	What are you doing?
F	CANDACE	Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's never hit me before. I promise he'll never hit me again.
M	CHARLIE	Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
F	CANDACE	Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek. I can handle him. Will you trust me? Please, don't tell mom and dad.
F	SAM	Oh, my God. They're playing good music.
M	PATRICK	Holy shit. They are! They're playing good music!
F	SAM	Living room routine?
M	PATRICK	Living room routine!
M	SAM & PATRICK	Hey!
F	SAM	God, it's freezing.
M	PATRICK	But you wore that toasty costume. It's not like you're trying too hard to be original.
F	SAM	Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
M	CHARLIE	Are you sure it's okay that I come?
F	SAM	Of course. Just remember, Charlie... Bob's not paranoid.
M	PATRICK	"He's sensitive."
M	BOB	Sam... that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?
F	SAM	Only if I have Patrick's blessing.
M	BOB	Patrick?
M	PATRICK	You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try. Charlie?
M	BOB	Touché.
M	PATRICK	Charlie... this is a party. kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	This is what fun looks like.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	You ready to meet some desperate women?
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	This is Charlie's first party ever. So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Patrick, you're such a dick.
M	PATRICK	Where the hell did you go?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	The dance was a little boring, don't you think?
M	PATRICK	You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Cry me a river.
M	PATRICK	How is it that you got meaner since
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Just lucky I guess.
M	PATRICK	I think you're doing something wrong.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Or something very right.
M	SAM (O.S.)	Hey! Look who's here!
M	CHARLIE	Is that Brad Hays?
M	ALICE	Yeah. He comes here sometimes.
M	CHARLIE	But he's a popular kid.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Then, what are we?
M	BOB	Charlie, you look like you could use a brownie.
M	CHARLIE	Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks.
M	CHARLIE	Have you guys felt this carpet? This carpet feels so darn good.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Charlie, what do you think about high school?
M	CHARLIE	High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	This kid is crazy.
M	CHARLIE	And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs. I'm really sorry. That sounded like a compliment in my head.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Oh, my God!
M	ALICE	Well, it's kind of true.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Shut up!
F	SAM	Bob, did you get him stoned?
M	BOB	Come on, Sam. He likes it. Just look at him.
F	SAM	How do you feel, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	I just really want a milkshake.
M	CHARLIE	Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself. You know what I mean?
F	SAM	Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milkshake.
M	CHARLIE	What a great word. Milkshake. It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy.
F	SAM	I'm guessing you've never been high before?
M	CHARLIE	Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too.
F	SAM	Well, where is Michael tonight?
M	CHARLIE	Oh, he shot himself last May.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I kind of wish he'd left a note. You know what I mean? Where's the bathroom?
F	SAM	It's up the stairs.
M	CHARLIE	
M	CHARLIE	Charlie. Charlie. Weird.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Woah.
M	PATRICK	Charlie?
M	BRAD HAYS	Who is that kid?
M	PATRICK	Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here.
M	CHARLIE	I didn't see anything.
M	PATRICK	I know you saw something, but it's okay.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know... wait, are you baked?
M	CHARLIE	"Like a cake." That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny.
M	PATRICK	Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret.
M	CHARLIE	Our little secret. Agreed.
M	PATRICK	Thank you. We'll talk later.
M	CHARLIE	I look forward to that big talk.
M	CHARLIE	Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one.
F	SAM	I need to talk to you. Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself. I don't think he has any friends.
M	PATRICK	Everyone. Raise your glasses to Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	What did I do?
M	PATRICK	You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend. You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	What is it? What's wrong?
M	CHARLIE	
M	PATRICK	Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone...
M	SAM & EVERYONE	To Charlie.
F	SAM	Welcome to the island of misfit toys.
F	SAM	My God. What is this song!?
M	PATRICK	Right? I have no idea.
F	SAM	Have you heard it before?
M	CHARLIE	Never.
F	SAM	Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
M	PATRICK	Sam, it's freezing.
F	SAM	Patrick, it's the perfect song!
M	PATRICK	No. Mama Patrick says no.
F	SAM	Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to you, I'm begging you to drive me--
M	PATRICK	Alright! I concede!
M	CHARLIE	What is she doing?
M	PATRICK	Don't worry. She does it all the time.
F	SAM	Turn it up!
M	PATRICK	You got it, your highness.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	What?
M	CHARLIE	I feel infinite. Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but I've been trying hard not to be a loser.
M	AIR SUPPLY	I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	For example, I am trying to participate by listening to Sam's collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love. Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant. I completely agree.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I am also studying extra books outside of class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer. He even had a play put up in New York once, which I think is very impressive. He and his wife might go back there after this year. I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	My favorite time, though, is lunch because I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky. Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a "long day."
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened.
M	CHARLIE	When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, "Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember a thing." This went on for 7 months.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry. saying his dad would kill him. And saying he was going to hell.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I think that I understand because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	So, I've been making her a mix tape so she will know how I feel.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Ah, shit!
M	ROCKY EMCEE CROWD	Gimme an R! Gimme an O! R-O-C-K-Y! Rocky! Rocky! Gimme a C! Gimme a K! Gimme Rocky! a Y! What's that spell!?
M	PATRICK	Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any measure. And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. Can't you just see it? Woah oh oh!
M	ALICE	It's gorgeous, Craig. What did you use?
M	CRAIG	Color film, but black and white paper for the printing. My professor gave me an "A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of them are idiots. You'll see what I mean when you get to college. How were your SAT's by the way?
M	ALICE	1150. I think I'll get into NYU.
M	CRAIG	Yeah, I hope so.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	1490. Harvard. Face!
M	CHARLIE	Hey. Are you okay?
F	SAM	Yeah. Yeah. But I got my SAT results back. Oops.
M	CHARLIE	You can take them again.
F	SAM	Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn State main campus, I have to do much better. I wish I would have studied freshman year. I was a bit of a mess.
M	CHARLIE	I'll help you study for the next one.
F	SAM	Will you?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, of course.
F	SAM	Thanks, Charlie. What's this?
M	CHARLIE	Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so--
F	SAM	It's okay. These are great. You have really good taste, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Really?
F	SAM	Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman. I used to listen to the worst top 40.
M	CHARLIE	No.
F	SAM	Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something. And I'd look up and see this person across the room. And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay. You know what I mean?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
M	ALICE	So, what do you think?
M	PATRICK	I don't know.
M	ALICE	I hope it works out. Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	No, shit. Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?
M	PATRICK	I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her... don't make yourself small. You can't save anybody.
M	CRAIG	Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How about something a little more upbeat?
M	CRAIG (CONT'D)	Sam tells me you want to be a writer.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
M	ALICE	Don't you write poetry, Craig?
M	CRAIG	No. Poetry writes me. You know?
M	BILL	Wow. That was fast. You want another one?
M	CHARLIE	Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something?
M	BILL	Yeah.
M	CHARLIE	Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
M	BILL	Are we talking about anyone specific?
M	BILL (CONT'D)	We accept the love we think we deserve.
M	CHARLIE	Can we make them know they deserve more?
M	BILL	We can try.
F	SAM	Hey, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in. You want to work on probabilities and statistics?
M	CHARLIE	Hey, dad. Can I have 30 dollars?
M	FATHER	20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars for?
M	CHARLIE	Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please.
M	FATHER	Have fun.
M	CHARLIE	Thanks.
M	BILL	Charlie... this was my favorite book growing up. This is my copy, but I want you to have it.
M	CHARLIE	Thanks.
M	BILL	Have a great Christmas break.
M	CHARLIE	You too, Mr. Anderson.
M	MR. CALLAHAN	Terrible stain. He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock. He hands Charlie
M	MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)	That's pretty good, Charlie.
M	MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)	You've got to be kidding me.
M	PATRICK	If you fail me, you get me next semester.
M	PATRICK	Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over! Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!
F	SAM	Below average!
F	SAM	Hey, guys. 1210.
F	SAM	No more applications! No more SAT's! Thank you, Charlie!
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This is a really tough one, but I'm going to have to guess... Alice.
M	MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Wait, guys... a receipt! She actually paid!
M	PATRICK	Impossible!
M	MARY ELIZABETH	I'm so touched.
M	CHARLIE	Where's Craig?
F	SAM	He went home to Connecticut. He'll be back for New Year's Eve.
M	CHARLIE	I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
F	SAM	Alright, big brother by 3 weeks. Who's your secret santa?
M	PATRICK	I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song "Asleep" on it... twice.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	I mean, I have no idea. This collection of presents is so gay that I think I must have given them to myself. But despite that distinct possibility, I'm going to have to go with... drum roll... Charlie.
F	SAM	Alright, Charlie... it's your turn.
M	CHARLIE	Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.
M	PATRICK	Huh. Now, why do you say that?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	What the hell is wrong with you?
M	CHARLIE	Sorry.
M	PATRICK	Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me.
M	CHARLIE	You got me clothes? Why?
M	PATRICK	Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star.
M	CHARLIE	Can you hand these out while I'm gone?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Wait a second. There's only secret santa presents. There are rules, Charlie.
M	PATRICK	Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam. Sam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice
M	ALICE	"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."
M	MARY ELIZABETH	40 dollars. "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."
M	BOB	He knows me. He really knows me.
F	SAM	Come on out, Charlie.
M	PATRICK	Yeah! What a display of man I have ever seen!
M	CHARLIE	Where are we going?
F	SAM	It's a surprise.
M	CHARLIE	Is this your room? It's so cool.
F	SAM	Thanks.
M	CHARLIE	You got me a present?
F	SAM	With all that help on my Penn State application? Of course I did. Open it.
M	CHARLIE	I don't know what to say.
F	SAM	You don't have to say anything.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	I'm sorry we can't be here for your birthday.
M	CHARLIE	That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.
F	SAM	I'm in such a great mood, I don't think even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm finally doing good.
M	CHARLIE	You are.
F	SAM	Me? What about you? When I met you, you were this scared freshman. And look at you in that suit. You're like a sexy English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
M	CHARLIE	No.
F	SAM	Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see you coming. And parents love you. That's like... extra danger.
M	CHARLIE	Well, it hasn't worked so far.
F	SAM	Come on. You've never had a girlfriend? Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Have you ever kissed a girl?
M	CHARLIE	No. What about you?
F	SAM	Have I ever kissed a girl?
M	CHARLIE	No! Your first kiss...
F	SAM	My first kiss? I was 11. His name was Robert. He would come over to the house all the time.
M	CHARLIE	Was he your first boyfriend?
F	SAM	He was my dad's boss.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	You know Charlie, I used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit. And get wasted all the time. But now... I feel like I have a chance. I could even get into a real college.
M	CHARLIE	It's true. You can do it.
F	SAM	
M	CHARLIE	My Aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life around.
F	SAM	She must have been great.
M	CHARLIE	She was my favorite person in the world... until now.
F	SAM	Charlie, I know that you know I like Craig. But I want to forget that for a minute. Okay? I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you. Okay?
M	SAM (CONT'D)	I love you, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	I love you, too.
M	GANG	"Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your dad's!" "See you at New Year's!"
M	CHARLIE	Have a good time at your mom's.
M	PATRICK	Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart.
M	CHARLIE	Thank you, Patrick.
M	PATRICK	I love you guys!
M	FATHER	Hey! Look who's here!
M	CHRIS	Come here, little sister.
F	CANDACE	Hey, Chris.
M	CHRIS	Ma, you look so thin!
M	MOTHER	10 pounds... Weight Watchers.
M	CHRIS	Charlie...
M	CHRIS (CONT'D)	Happy birthday.
M	MOTHER	Make a wish, honey.
M	AUNT HELEN	Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus.
M	AUNT HELEN (CONT'D)	Keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister. I'll be right back.
M	AUNT HELEN (CONT'D)	I'm going to get your birthday present.
M	CHARLIE	Hey.
M	CHRIS	Hey. God, I missed mom's cooking. You have no idea how good you have it. I'm actually beginning to hate pizza.
M	CHARLIE	How are you liking school?
M	CHRIS	Not bad. I'm no brainiac like you or Candace. But I'm doing okay.
M	CHARLIE	Okay? You're playing in a Bowl Game.
M	CHRIS	How are you feeling, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Good.
M	CHRIS	You know what I mean. Is it bad tonight?
M	CHARLIE	No.
M	CHRIS	No?
M	CHARLIE	I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off.
M	CHRIS	now. And maybe if it does get bad again, you can just talk to them, yeah?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now.
M	CHARLIE	How long does this take to work?
F	SAM	Shoveling snow, huh?
M	CHARLIE	I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it.
F	SAM	You said that an hour ago.
M	CHARLIE	Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then
F	SAM	Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Isn't it quiet?
M	CHARLIE	Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?
F	SAM	All the time. So, you want to put on these glasses? They'll protect you.
M	PATRICK	
M	AUNT HELEN	It'll be our little secret, all right?
M	PATRICK	7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
M	POLICEMAN	Did your older friends pressure you?
M	CHARLIE	No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never.
M	POLICEMAN	Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning?
M	CHARLIE	Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out.
M	MOTHER	You're seeing things again, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Not, uh... Not really.
M	CHARLIE	It was a Christmas present.
M	CHARLIE	Did you have fun on your break?
M	BILL	More fun than you're going to have today, Sinatra.
M	SMART ASS FRESHMAN	Nice look, jag off. I called him 30 times.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Well what are we supposed to do? We're going on in 10 minutes!
M	CHARLIE	But they said in health class--
M	BRAD HAYS	They say that about LSD to scare you.
M	CHARLIE	Are you sure?
M	BRAD HAYS	Charlie, you're fine, man.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Guys, we have an emergency. Craig flaked out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad?
M	BRAD HAYS	No way. There are people out here.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Charlie... take off your clothes.
F	SAM	So if anything grows while you pose. I'll oil you up and drop you down. And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction. You need a friendly hand. And I need action!
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Ah! Touch a touch a touch me! I wanna be dirty! Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill me! Creature of the night!
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Creature of the night!
M	CHARLIE	Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college. I could put in a good word for you.
M	CHARLIE	That'd be great. Thanks.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?
M	CHARLIE	The one where the girl asks the guy.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture. But, you know, it's my last year, and... would you maybe want to go with me?
M	CHARLIE	You want to go with me?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked really cute in your costume. So, what do you say?
M	MOTHER	You must be Mary Elizabeth. It's so good to meet you.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
M	FATHER	Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.
M	FATHER	OK, a little closer together. That looks nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more. There you go. Nice.
M	CHARLIE	Are you having a good time?
F	SAM	Not really. How about you?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to.
F	SAM	Don't worry. You're doing fine.
M	CHARLIE	I'm sorry Craig didn't come.
F	SAM	Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance. Can't say I blame him.
M	CHARLIE	I don't know. If you like it, he should come.
F	SAM	Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it.
M	CHARLIE	I'll try not to make you too jealous.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Mmmm. Now, let it breathe.
M	CHARLIE	This is sure a nice house.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Thanks.
M	MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Mmmm. Don't you just love old music? Good. Because I made you a mix of it. I'd love to expose you to great things. Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.
M	CHARLIE	This merlot is really fancy.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?
M	CHARLIE	I guess. Where are your parents?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist. They'll be gone all night.
M	CHARLIE	That's sure a nice fire.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Yeah. After I'm done being a lobbyist, I want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod. That sounds nice, doesn't it?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Your heart is beating really fast.
M	CHARLIE	Is it?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Here, feel.
M	MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Uh-huh?
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Do you like me?
M	CHARLIE	Uh-huh.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	You know what I mean.
M	CHARLIE	I think so.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Don't be nervous.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Charlie... I didn't know how it was going to go tonight, but it was really nice, huh?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	I can't believe it. You of all people. I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.
M	MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Oh, shit! My parents!
M	MARY ELIZABETH	See you Monday.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	We're literally making out, and I'm in my bra. Hello! And the front door opens. It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe?
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone. And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, I tried hard to love her like I love Sam.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary?
M	CHARLIE	I know.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	So, I took her on double dates.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Your first foreign film.
M	CHARLIE	
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Vegans don't eat butter.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	And I had to admit something really upsetting. But I am tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Walden? I read it in 7th grade. I would have called it "On Boring Pond."
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Or if she would stop calling me the minute I get home from school when I have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home...
M	MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)	That dairy just sits with you. It walks with you.
M	MOTHER	She's on the phone right now? Charlie, you have to break up with her.
M	CHARLIE	I can do that?
M	FATHER	For Christ's sake... I need to use the phone!
M	MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)	I'll give you this book. It's really how I became a vegan--
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I know I should have been honest, but I was getting so mad, it was starting to scare me.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you--
M	MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)	Charlie. Please, don't interrupt. You know I hate that.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I just wish I could have found another way to break up. In hindsight, I probably could not have picked a worse way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.
M	BOB	
M	PATRICK	Who are you talking to?
M	BOB	I dare you to kiss Alice.
M	PATRICK	Get ready, breeder.
M	CRAIG	Mary Elizabeth? Samantha told me that you got into Harvard. Congratulations.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Thank you. This one still hasn't gotten me flowers. But I forgive you.
M	CRAIG	Don't worry about Penn State. You're just wait-listed.
M	PATRICK	Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing some hot "fag on goth" action.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Okay. My turn. Um... let's think... Charlie... truth or dare?
M	CHARLIE	Truth.
M	PATRICK	How is your first relationship going?
M	CHARLIE	It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her.
M	PATRICK	Charlie? Truth or dare?
M	CHARLIE	Dare.
M	PATRICK	I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it... I'd smoke all you bitches.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Now that's fucked up.
M	CHARLIE	Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry. I'm--
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry.
F	SAM	What the hell is wrong with you?
M	CHARLIE	
M	PATRICK	Trust me. You don't want to go back there.
M	CHARLIE	But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do anything.
M	PATRICK	I know you didn't, but look... I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam. Other guys. Things that have nothing to do with you. But... it's best if you stay away for awhile.
M	CHARLIE	Oh. Okay. How long do you think?
M	MOTHER	We're going to be late for Easter Mass.
M	CHARLIE	I'll... I'll be there in a minute.
M	PRIEST	Our Father who art in Heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come--
M	PRIEST	Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
M	PRIEST	And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us--
M	PRIEST	And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from--
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Mary Elizabeth... I... uh... I've been listening to the Billie Holiday CD every night and-- It's too late, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	I know. I just feel really bad about what I did. I just get so messed up inside like I'm - not there or something.
M	MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)	Tell it to someone who cares.
M	CHARLIE	I know. I'm sorry. I just. We've all become such good friends--
M	MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)	Good friends? You mean the people I've known since kindergarten that you've known for 6 months? Those good friends?
M	CHARLIE	Oh. Yeah. I mean I don't want to do anything to ruin our-- It's ruined. Okay? So, stop calling everyone. Stop embarrassing yourself.
M	CHARLIE	Okay. I will. Goodbye, Mar--
M	CHARLIE	Something's wrong with me--
M	BOB	Don't worry about it. Hey... you hear from Patrick?
M	CHARLIE	No. He told me to stay away.
M	BOB	Oh... you don't know?
M	CHARLIE	Why? Why? What happened?
M	BOB	Brad's father caught them together.
M	GOSSIP WHISPERS (O.S.)	"Some Lebo kids jumped him outside the O." "It was some kids from North Hills." "That's not what I heard."
M	CHARLIE	Are you okay?
M	PATRICK	Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.
M	TWIN SENIOR GIRLS	says nothing. He's too sad to fight the mob today.
M	NOSE TACKLE	Oops. Sorry, Nothing.
M	PATRICK	You going to do something?
M	BRAD HAYS	What are you talking about?
M	PATRICK	Your pet ape just tripped me. Are you going to say something?
M	BRAD HAYS	Why would I?
M	PATRICK	You know why.
M	BRAD HAYS	This is pathetic, man. Your fixation on me.
M	PATRICK	Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises? Really?
M	BRAD HAYS	I got jumped in a parking lot.
M	PATRICK	Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know about Schenley Park? Do you guys know about Schenley Park?
M	BRAD HAYS	I don't know what kind of sick shit you're trying to pull. But you better walk away now... Nothing.
M	PATRICK	Fine. Say hi to your dad for me.
M	BRAD HAYS	Whatever... faggot.
M	PATRICK	What did you call me?
M	BRAD HAYS	I called you a faggo--
M	PATRICK	Say that shit again! Say that shit again!
M	MARY ELIZABETH	It's Patrick!
F	SAM	No! No!
M	CHARLIE	If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you.
M	BRAD HAYS	Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah?
M	BRAD HAYS	Thanks for stopping them.
M	CHARLIE	Sure, Brad.
F	SAM	How you doing, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know. I keep trying, but... I can't really remember what I did.
F	SAM	Do you want me to tell you?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
F	SAM	You saved my brother. That's what you did.
M	CHARLIE	So, you're not scared of me?
F	SAM	No.
M	CHARLIE	And can we be friends again?
F	SAM	Of course.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Come on. Let's go be psychos together.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	I'm dating Peter now.
M	MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	He's in college with Craig. He's opinionated, and we have intellectual debates. You were very sweet, but our relationship was too one-sided. I know this is hard for you.
M	CHARLIE	I'm just glad you're happy.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Okay.
M	PATRICK	Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	We're going to miss the movie.
M	CRAIG	Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step.
M	PATRICK	Hey... you wanna get out of here?
M	CHARLIE	Sure, Patrick.
M	PATRICK (V.O.)	I'll tell you something, Charlie. I feel good. You know what I mean? Maybe tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke place downtown. And this club off the strip. They don't card. And the Schenley Park scene. You gotta see the "fruit loop" at least one time.
M	PATRICK	Oh, my God. My life is officially an after school special. Son of a bitch!
M	CHARLIE	It kind of is. It so is.
M	PATRICK	So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know.
M	PATRICK	Really? I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic.
M	CHARLIE	Maybe.
M	PATRICK	So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know.
M	PATRICK	They did it with one of the sandwich bags.
M	CHARLIE	Ew! That's disgusting!
M	PATRICK	Yes! It is! Let's keep the train rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!
M	CHARLIE	Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade--
M	PATRICK	Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.
M	CHARLIE	And she let some of the boys feel them.
M	PATRICK	That's your suburban legend? Did you at least cop a feel?
M	CHARLIE	No.
M	PATRICK	Of course not. You went home, listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self- esteem--
M	CHARLIE	Fine! Okay. Your turn.
M	PATRICK	Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill. Guy's father didn't know about his son. So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town. Catches his son with another boy. So, he starts beating him. But not like the slap kind. Like the real kind. And the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're killing him." And the son just yells "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend just did.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Why can't you save anybody?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know.
M	PATRICK	Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could meet the love of my life any second now. Things will be different now, and that's good. I just need to meet a good guy.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
M	PATRICK	I'm sorry.
M	CHARLIE	It's alright.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I've been spending a lot of time with Patrick. He begins every night really excited.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	He always says he feels free, and tonight is his destiny. But after awhile, he runs out of things to keep himself numb.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.
M	PATRICK	"We will require you to take our summer session at the main campus immediately following your high school graduation." She got in, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	After that all Patrick could talk about did get into NYU Film School. Patrick is going to the University of Washington because he wants to be near the music in Seattle.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	But he wasn't going to leave without organizing the best senior prank ever. Sam is going to leave right after graduation. It all feels very exciting; I just wish it were happening to me.
M	CHARLIE	Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this time.
M	BILL	Guys, you want to pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front please? And I know it's the last day, but if we could just keep it to a dull roar, I'd appreciate it. Thank you for such a great year. I had a blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations. Now, who here is going to be reading for pleasure this summer?
M	BILL (CONT'D)	Very good, Charlie. Who else?
M	BILL	Last day.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided... are you going to New York?
M	BILL	Well, my wife and I like it here, and I think I might be better at teaching than writing.
M	BILL (CONT'D)	So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I could still give you books next year.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. Yeah.
M	BILL	I think you could write one of them one day.
M	CHARLIE	Really?
M	BILL	I do. Charlie is quiet. Then...
M	CHARLIE	You're the best teacher I ever had.
M	BILL	Thank you.
M	SAM & COMPANY	Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here!
M	ALL	
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about us running. There was this beautiful sunset. And just a few hours before, everyone I love had their last day of high school ever. And I was happy because they were happy, even though I counted, and I have 1,095 days to go.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I kept thinking about what school was going to be like without them as they As mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	My sister finally decided to break up with Derek and go stag with her girlfriends instead.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	And then there was Sam...
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I've looked at her pictures since that night. I like to see how happy she was before she knew. They were in a hotel suite after prom when the truth came out...
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam the whole time. When I heard that, I kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures. Because she doesn't have 1,095 days to go.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	She made it. This is her time. And no one should be able to take that away. Congratulations.
M	PATRICK	Oh, Charlie's here! Guys, group photo! We should all take a group photo. Get against the railing and try to look suave!
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Yeah, this is the one. That's going to be a great angle.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	At her going away party, I wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel. And how for the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	And tomorrow, she's leaving. So, I wanted to give her a part of me.
F	SAM	Are these all your books, Charlie?
F	SAM	Thanks for staying up with me.
M	CHARLIE	Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition.
F	SAM	That sounds like fun.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore.
F	SAM	Yes, I will. I had lunch with Craig today.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah?
F	SAM	He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him. But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small. Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?
M	CHARLIE	We accept the love we think we deserve.
F	SAM	Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?
M	CHARLIE	I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that.
F	SAM	Well, what did you want?
M	CHARLIE	I just want you to be happy.
F	SAM	Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me.
M	CHARLIE	I know who you are, Sam.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How much we are alike. And how we've been through the same things. And you're not small. You're beautiful.
F	SAM	What's wrong, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Oh, ah... nothing.
F	SAM	I'll call all the time.
M	MARY ELIZABETH	Promise.
F	SAM	And we'll all see each other in New York.
M	SAM'S MOM	Come on, Sam.
F	SAM	What's wrong, Charlie?
M	BACK TO PRESENT:	
M	AUNT HELEN	Don't wake your sister.
M	AUNT HELEN	It'll be our little secret, okay?
M	AUNT HELEN	Look, Charlie. She's fast asleep.
M	AUNT HELEN	Don't wake your sister.
M	CHARLIE	Stop crying.
M	CHARLIE	Stop crying. It'll be our little secret.
M	CANDACE'S FRIEND	Candace... your brother's on the phone.
F	CANDACE	Hello.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Hey, Candace.
F	CANDACE	Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something.
F	CANDACE	What?
M	CHARLIE	Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over.
F	CANDACE	Call the police and send them to my house.
M	CHARLIE	And I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
F	CANDACE	No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad are going to be home with Chris any second.
M	CHARLIE	I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace?
F	CANDACE	What? Charlie... Charlie!
F	DR. BURTON	Charlie? I'm Dr. Burton.
M	CHARLIE	Where am I?
F	DR. BURTON	Mayview hospital.
M	CHARLIE	You have to let me go. My dad can't afford it.
F	DR. BURTON	Don't worry about that.
M	CHARLIE	No. I saw them when I was little. And I don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just tell me how to stop it.
F	DR. BURTON	Stop what?
M	CHARLIE	Seeing it. All their lives. All the time. Just... how do you stop seeing it?
F	DR. BURTON	Seeing what, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	There is so much pain. And I don't know how to not notice it.
F	DR. BURTON	What's hurting you?
M	CHARLIE	No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand?
F	DR. BURTON	What about your Aunt Helen?
M	CHARLIE	What about her?
F	DR. BURTON	Can you see her?
M	CHARLIE	Yes, she had a terrible life. But... I mean, what am I...
F	DR. BURTON	You said some things about her in your sleep.
M	CHARLIE	I don't care.
F	DR. BURTON	If you want to get better, you have to--
M	CHARLIE	She was... insane.
F	DR. BURTON	Charlie, are you going to let me help you here?
M	CHARLIE	Okay. Do you remember anything before you blacked out?
M	CHARLIE	I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home...
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me.
M	MOTHER	Honey?
M	MOTHER (CONT'D)	I'm so sorry.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job.
F	DR. BURTON	There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right?
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.
M	FATHER	God bless this food that we are about to receive. We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
M	CHARLIE	How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad?
M	FATHER	God damn Penguins. I think they're allergic to God damn defense.
M	CHARLIE	What do the players call a puck again?
M	FATHER	A biscuit.
F	CANDACE	Are you sure it's not a "God damn biscuit?"
M	FATHER	You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
M	PATRICK	Can Charlie come out and play?
F	SAM	That first night, I had grilled stickies. It was so good. You have to visit in the Fall. We'll have some. Okay?
M	CHARLIE	Definitely.
M	PATRICK	Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October.
F	SAM	Well, can I tell you something? I've been away for two months. It's another world. And it gets better. And my roommate Katie has the best taste in music.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	I found the tunnel song.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Let's drive.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school. And you helped me. Even if you didn't know what I was talking about. Or know someone who's gone through it. It made me not feel alone.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories.
M	CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D)	This is happening. I am here. And I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And in this moment, I swear... ... we are infinite.
