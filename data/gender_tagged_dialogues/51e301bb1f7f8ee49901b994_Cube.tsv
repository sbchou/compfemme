M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M		
M		looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her is a lady. The lady screams, and sits down in a corner the room.
M		sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you.
M		do you want?
M		thought you were...
M		
M		don't know...
M		
M		what?
M		ok, come here. Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough, Leaven falls and drops her glasses. Leaven sits up
M		ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine.
M		was in there?
M		give me a minute to figure things out.
M		are you afraid of that room?
M		give me a minute I said.
M		many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go around in here.
M		not?
M		traps.
M		do you mean, traps?
M		I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my the traps. Leaven breathes heavily.
M		God, holy, holy God!
M		you alright? Mister? Worth?
M		
M		hit my head?
M		me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't bad.
M		the hell are you doing?
M		old man?
M		integrated in the walls. Tough to spot.
M		God, oh God, oh God.
M		a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember
M		I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of
M		Leaven?
M		I just went to bed and then
M		about you?
M		just woke up here.
M		of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the of the night.
M		
M		the government can build something this ugly.
M		it ain't government.
M		what is it.
M		don't know.
M		
M		we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on
M		mom's gonna freak...
M		
M		won't be there...
M		do you think Rennes?
M		don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line,
M		I attend to agree.
M		we wait here? To see if anybody comes.
M		one is gonna come.
M		a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the
M		
M		can't be that simple.
M		ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's at us.
M		just wanna wake up... her.
M		we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright?
M		a cop?
M		I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you be with me on this one...
M		
M		it!
M		
M		one sounded closer.
M		mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals.
M		it's the ventilationsystem?
M		bets...
M		kidding, I'm boiling are some others: 476 804 539.
M		is it, serial numbers?
M		numbers, they're different in each room.
M		great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing.
M		better not be! We have about three days without food and before we're too weak to move.
M		have to feed us, don't they?
M		
M		we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process.
M		on it... Keeps the saliva flowing.
M		
M		air seems dry in there.
M		
M		chemical sensor.
M		the hell didn't the boot set it off.
M		boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from skin.
M		come, you know so much about sensors, Renz?
M		Not Renz! It's french!
M		you're french. I'm asking how...
M		Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe
M		guy is The Wren...
M		what?
M		Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major
M		
M		kidding right?
M		can get us out?
M		
M		escapeartist!
M		I'm Harry "fucking" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't think about something which is not right in front of ya. the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from
M		
M		him out! dead, most of his head his been dissolved.
M		it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it. Wren... That's great, that's fucking great.
M		It's time to reassess this place.
M		been over it again and again, why would they throw people in here? Are we being punished?
M		never done anything to deserve this!
M		about all that! You can't see the big picture from in So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple. look, look at what's in front of you.
M		what he said.
M		with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop. gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway. gives you a function, a reason, right?
M		it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one the ten million other doctors out there"!
M		What are you?
M		I jst go to school, hang out with my friends.
M		else?
M		is nothing else. My parents are these people live with them... I'm boring.
M		think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it
M		down, four to go.
M		don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth!
M		wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life sucks in general.
M		can't stand that attitude.
M		he's right.
M		your purpose Quentin?
M		Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet. getting out of here no matter what. That's where strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you a wife or a girlfriend or something?
M		I got a pretty nice collection of pornography
M		nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst. wanna know who's responsible.
M		your glasses? You don't need them?
M		for reading.
M		they took off her jewelry, but they must have put on you. If nothing is random... why are they here.
M		what do you read in school? Math?
M		can they mean?
M		
M		I can't believe I didn't see it before.
M		what?
M		seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is 11 x 59, it's not prime either. So that room is safe.
M		wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one
M		not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The thing had 137, the acidroom had 149.
M		remembered all that in your head?
M		have a facility for it.
M		you beautiful brain... Boot it.
M		out of the way.
M		before beauty.
M		Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers!
M		long have we been in here
M		or ten hours.
M		do you know?
M		'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving.
M		guess I missed breakfeast... or lunch... or whatever
M		don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner.
M		we get out, I'l make you dinner.
M		got a date.
M		good.
M		need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk.
M		Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving
M		You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to occupied.
M		to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you
M		you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me your rugrats.
M		We have three boys. Nine, seven and five.
M		good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that.
M		didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just
M		sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze.
M		numbers aren't prime.
M		Clear.
M		me, sorry.
M		could try and help me out here buddy.
M		I couldn't
M		one is trapped too.
M		have to backtrack?
M		yet.
M		no.
M		them to me.
M		are you? His coatrack? Oh please. door, he says:
M		stuck!
M		room is green.
M		
M		there.
M		room is green.
M		it is.
M		wanna go back to the blue room.
M		it shock or what?
M		think he's mentally handicapped.
M		like the blue room.
M		Christ!
M		almost broke my neck.
M		there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey?
M		first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey.
M		did he survive?
M		wanna go back to the blue room.
M		lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you soon.
M		is just way too bizarre.
M		you just worry about your own numbers...
M		on, I'll look after him.
M		obviously. Since he almost fell on my head.
M		we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk? He hits himself with the one hand on his head.
M		Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away.
M		
M		where Kazan opens a new door.
M		they have taken us all the way to New Mexico?
M		are you talking about Holloway?
M		talking about: "Where do you hide something this big?" It has at
M		sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea your tax-dollars go.
M		clinic doctors?
M		the military industrial complex can afford to build something size.
M		what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been
M		how would you know from where you are.
M		do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their
M		that what you think?
M		
M		you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on. It seems like she's being choken.
M		
M		Get back here.
M		ok. I just swallowed my button.
M		hate this! I hate this!
M		boy's having a conniption sitting there.
M		like crème without coffee.
M		needs a break.
M		can do it. back to the other room.
M		don't look prime to me.
M		that your two bits worth, Worth?
M		course it's what is worth.
M		
M		he's right. Not prime.
M		In front of you!!! jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces.
M		is it?
M		UP!!!
M		don't know what happened. it wasn't prime.
M		hold still!
M		stop that rackets!
M		
M		the boots.
M		shut the fucking door!
M		had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap.
M		these numbers aren't prime.
M		your numbersystem failed, but he knew.
M		what? How could he know?
M		the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is kick us when we're down.
M		he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy.
M		me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray.
M		doesn't like red rooms.
M		what happened?
M		you saw what happened!
M		
M		guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought.
M		they mean nothing at all.
M		it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just
M		need to rest anyway.
M		that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do.
M		they telling you anything?
M		not Tarot-cards. Do you have any idea on how many variables I
M		like people.
M		gross.
M		not here honey, over in the corner.
M		he's just peeing!
M		Christ!
M		Now it totally reeks in here!
M		you find this all pretty funny, don't you?
M		your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than
M		Kommandant!
M		has to taka responsibility around here.
M		that somebody has to be you.
M		all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists.
M		all of us are conceded enough to play hero.
M		the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you
M		will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks
M		poor Worth: "Nobody loves me". If that's the chip on your shoulders,
M		it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be
M		so.
M		you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you
M		you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out.
M		think we matter, we don't
M		us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here.
M		you're not getting out.
M		we are!
M		is no way outta here!!!
M		ya.
M		Do you know?
M		the question Worth.
M		God!
M		are you?
M		am the poison. I designed the outer shell.
M		
M		shell, the sarcophagus.
M		builded this thing?
M		this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or
M		cube! Why didn't you tell us?
M		Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was.
M		
M		You're lying.
M		first.
M		beyond it?
M		don't know.
M		hired you?
M		didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some
M		You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs
M		Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so
M		brain?
M		all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations.
M		you don't get it.
M		tell me, please, I need to know.
M		maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody
M		kind of fucking explanation is that?
M		the best you´re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can
M		had to say yes to this thing.
M		thing? Only we know what it is.
M		have no idea, what it is.
M		know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known
M		put people in it?
M		it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless.
M		it is pointless!
M		That's my point.
M		have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought.
M		really, just more pathetic.
M		make me sick, Worth!
M		make me sick too. We´re both part of the system. I drew a box - you
M		that how we're ruining the world?
M		Have you been on glue all of your life. I felt guilty for ruining
M		I feel better.
M		why you stayed with us. To confess.
M		looking for someone to bust, Quentin?
M		Quentin, STOP IT!
M		need him.
M		for?
M		you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about
M		
M		
M		there's this outer shell.
M		
M		it's a cube, like this?
M		assume so.
M		there any doors?
M		one door.
M		
M		the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the
M		are the dimensions of the outer shell?
M		feetsquare.
M		I?
M		on. Side over.
M		by 14 by 14.
M		inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space.
M		cube?
M		don't know. It makes sense.
M		the biggest the cube then can be is... 26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms
M		rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy.
M		
M		you are a genius!
M		see three numbers: 517 478 565
M		co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates. They are
M		English. Slower.
M		these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and
M		where are we?
M		works! Ok, all I have to do now is add the numbers together. The X
M		let's go.
M		out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what
M		we can get the door open.
M		we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps.
M		dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here.
M		you haven't found any yet!
M		cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first.
M		he won't Quentin, we take turns!
M		
M		there room for two in there?
M		the matter?
M		co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14.
M		about them?
M		they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there
M		not outside the cube.
M		guess that means we're not having dinner.
M		trap, trap. TRAP!
M	again.	
M		
M		It's soundactivated. BOOOH!
M		
M		come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off?
M		be reat to ignore it.
M		that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps.
M		I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else.
M		knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch.
M		
M		many boots do we have left Holloway?
M		it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet.
M		fucking quiet.
M		glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up.
M		he's not coming.
M		course he is.
M		way!
M		not leaving him behind.
M		unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but
M		on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into?
M		come back for him.
M		a lie and you know it.
M		be quiet.
M	KAZAN	
M		fucking fuck!
M		enough!
M		a trap!
M		him go right now!
M		of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack!
M		him go you nazi!
M		did you call me?
M		You let that innocent boy go.
M		listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The
M		dare you say that to her? You don't know her Quentin. None ouf us
M		I do.
M		you don't!
M		wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for
M		help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too?
M		anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that
M		it.
M		number six, not door number one, door number two.
M		the fucking thing.
M		Sunshine.
M		
M		old friend the shell.
M		there. Morning! we hear a gigantic echo.
M		on to me.
M		see shit. Nothing to hang on to.
M		have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone
M		you're gonna go. You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two
M		it.
M		go.
M		going Holloway.
M		right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven.
M		long did you know people we're put in here.
M		couple of months.
M		not long , if you consider your whole life.
M		am.
M		opened my eyes Worth, that´s something.
M		
M		
M		such a Helen.
M		as far as you go.
M		nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there.
M		you're getting heavy.
M		the hell is going on?
M		up here now!
M		
M		you got her?
M		going on?
M		she Ok?
M		slipped.
M		
M		Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that!
M		you gotta be strong sweetheart.
M		even talk to me.
M		gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from
M		can't think anymore.
M		you can. It's your gift.
M		not a gift, it's just a brain.
M		her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours.
M		one hour.
M		the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is?
M		hour is as long as I say.
M		are you doing?
M		have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you
M		you just wanna leave them?
M		traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out.
M		
M		fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I
M		slip you on the lock. It's time to go down.
M		away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard.
M		dropped her.
M		go Quentin
M		us the boot, you pig!
M		
M		don't want the boot.
M		
M		wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch.
M		
M		the fuck's with him?
M		does he...?
M		
M		could...?
M		We've been going in circles
M		can't be.
M		are we?
M		don't know.
M		are we???
M		figure it out! You haven't done anything. All you do is freak out!
M		were right Worth. There is no outta here.
M		Get away from me.
M		Rennes killed in that room?
M		come there's nothing out there.
M		see an edge.
M		were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes?
M		off!
M		that was good.
M		difference does it make? We're dead anyways.
M		Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't
M		course.
M		rooms?
M		explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole
M		the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot.
M		are you on to Leaven.
M		me a minute. The numbers are markers point on a map, right?
M		
M		how do you map a point that keeps moving?
M		
M		what?
M		A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through.
M		numbers tell you all that?
M		don't know. I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is
M		so it's moving. How do we get out?
M		I know where the exit is.
M		
M		away from me.
M		off, Quentin!
M		just wanna know, don't you wanna know?
M		remember that room we passed through before, the one with the
M		about it?
M		co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube.
M		bridge?
M		but only in it's original position.
M		are you talking about?
M		the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the
M		the bridge is just a bridge...
M		in a short period of time. This thing is like a giant
M		the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle.
M		when does it open?
M		We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the
M		what does that mean.
M		suck in math? Ok, I need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint.
M		
M		898... ok?
M		
M		545... Did you get that?
M		
M		enough. X is 17, y is 25 and z is 14. Which means this room makes
M		we have time?
M		
M		let's go.
M		you work out the traps in the system?
M		the traps, let's get to the bridge.
M		you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot.
M		I can identify the traps.
M		
M		I thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not.
M		so?
M		you calculate that?
M		numbers are huge.
M		you can, right? You can?
M		have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a
M		don't need a computer.
M		I do.
M		it out!
M		I do!
M		not dying in a fucking ratmaze.
M		No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the number:
M		Astronomical.
M		did you say?
M		
M		that...
M		
M		many factors Kazan? Of 567?
M		
M		are you fucking kidding?
M		many factors does 30 have?
M		
M		seven?
M		Gumdrop.
M		don't have any gumdrops.
M		
M		I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer.
M		come in bags.
M		want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags.
M		don't like the red ones.
M		
M		
M		
M		
M		giving us the factors.
M		
M		telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius.
M		those numbers the room should be safe.
M		only one way to find out.
M		
M		
M		my man!
M		the numbers boy? Right here! Look here! Make him do it.
M		we gonna do some numbers, ok? We like to do numbers, right?
M		
M		right. Can you tell me the factors of 656?
M		
M		
M		
M		
M		
M		
M		Come on let's go. You too Worth. Move your scuddy ass Worth, I'm
M		
M		Jesus!
M		Hurry!
M		
M		Come on Kazan... 563...
M		fuckheads, you're dead!
M		
M		
M		
M		
M		the floor.
M		he dead?
M		quite.
M		even close, Worth! When I'm finish I'll throw you in a fucking trap
M		is he? Come here! I said come here riiight..........
M		ya. That way. we see the number 805
M		
M		
M		
M		
M	out there.	
M		
M		guess that proves out theory. The numbers.
M		two, three.
M		
M		He hasn't moved far.
M		gonna find him. What do you think?
M		don't have a lot of lives left.
M		
M		didn't move.
M		good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok?
M		don't like that. 26... 14... WORTH GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!
M		bags of gumdrops?
M		bags total.
M		bags, deal.
M		here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge.
M		coming.

M		
M		it' better be it.
M		should be.
M		
M		arh.
M		me a minute. Be patient. So guess what, this was the room we started
M		bridge.
M		
M		
M		
M		
M	Worth sits down.	
M		
M		ahead.
M		are you doing. You can't quit now. It's not your fault!!!
