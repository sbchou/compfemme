M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Heather told me she teaches people Real Life.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	She said Real Life sucks Losers dry. If you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	I said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. She said Yes. I said You're Beautiful.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)	God, come on Veronica!
F	VERONICA	What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
F	VERONICA	Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
F	VERONICA	Hello, Heather.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
F	VERONICA	Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	You don't have anything for her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
F	VERONICA	I'll think about it.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Don't think.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica needs something to write on. Heather, bend over.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Heather Duke, back down.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Dear Martha, you're so sweet..
M	KURT	It'd be so righteous to be in a Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.
M	RAM	Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on my Johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.
M	EARL	Shit. Right.
M	RAM	Damn right right.
M	PETER	Come on people, let's give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches! Those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
F	VERONICA	Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Sawyer. Guess what today is?
F	VERONICA	Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
M	HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, so what's the question?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase.
M	HEATHER DUKE	I forgot.
F	VERONICA	Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
F	BETTY	Sorry Veronica.
F	VERONICA	Betty Finn. Gosh.....
F	VERONICA	I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
F	BETTY	That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
F	VERONICA	Don't say that.
F	BETTY	Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
F	VERONICA	I was talking with someone!
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
F	COURTNEY	Oh great. Here comes Heather.
M	COURTNEY'S FRIEND	Shit.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh, let me snare a tater.
F	COURTNEY	Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	That's pretty very. Now check this out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. What would you do?
M	KEITH	That's easy. I'd just slide that wad over to my father. He's like one of the top brokers in the state.
F	VERONICA	Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.
M	KEITH	Man, in two days, my dad could double my money. Triple it.
F	COURTNEY	If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
F	VERONICA	You're beautiful.
M	PETER	Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.
M	DENNIS	But that's the Famine Fund money.
M	PETER	Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat. If it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	If you're going to openly be a bitch....
F	VERONICA	I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
M	RODNEY	Did you see that? Heather Number One looked right at us.
M	BIG CYNIC	It must be love.
F	VERONICA	Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
F	VERONICA	Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
M	GEEK WITH BRACES	No seriously, I'd probably go to the Pyrimads. With a girl.
M	GEEK WITH GLASSES	Where you going to get a girl, stud? K-Mart?
M	BIG CYNIC	Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind. You sentimental old fart.
M	BRACES	Geez, forget it.
F	VERONICA	What about you Rodney?
M	RODNEY	I told you she knew my name. I'd change my life. New clothes. New haircut. New house. New home.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	How sad! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip.
F	VERONICA	If you're going to openly be a bitch....
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	This is the part I hate. The waiting. I'd say we're like twenty minutes from major humiliation. Come on, Veronica.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Veronica?
F	VERONICA	Damn..
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers are the same. Didn't you see The Breakfast Club?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)	Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl in the commercials and the videos.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)	I'm the blonde in the bikini on the horse holding a Pepsi can.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)	I'm the princess being spanked on the throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)	What do I get out of being friends with losers. I give them a piece of a winner and they stain me with loserness.
M	MATT	You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days. You hear that, Clyde? That's got to be the most spooky-ass question I've ever heard.
M	BETTY FINN	I think we should use the money for an End-of-the-world get-together. We could invite guys.
M	RAM	I'd pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the Kentucky Derby. She should be paying me, though.
M	FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET	What?
M	ALL-OUT NERD	This is important. With taxes, I'd be only getting 3.5 million and....
M	CLYDE	If you want a good way to go out before the aliens land, get a lion from the zoo. Put a remote control bomb up its butt. When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button. You and the lion die like as one.
M	JACKIE AND STEVE	Cool.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
F	VERONICA	Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Oh God, here we go...
M	PETER	A dime increases the time! A buck brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A five keeps the neighborhood alive! A ten and you die without sen!
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
F	VERONICA	I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
F	VERONICA	We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
M	HEATHER DUKE (O.S.)	Veronica, could you come back here?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER AND HEATHER MCNAMARA	Gross!
F	VERONICA	A true friend's work is never done.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Color me nauseous.
F	VERONICA	Maybe you should see a doctor.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, maybe.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER (O.S.)	Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
F	VERONICA	Geez, don't listen to them.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)	Did she have the pie or the ice cream for dessert? And the answer is.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
F	VERONICA	Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
F	VERONICA	Give me the clipboard.
F	VERONICA	Hello Jason Dean.
M	JASON	Greetings and salutations. Call me J.D. Are you a Heather?
F	VERONICA	No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may seem like a stupid question....
M	J.D.	There are no stupid questions.
F	VERONICA	If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
M	J.D.	That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
M	RAM	Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
M	KURT	Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
M	RAM	Let's kick his ass.
M	KURT	Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
M	J.D.	Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
F	VERONICA	How very.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Come on. Later.
M	J.D.	Definitely.
M	RAM	You going to eat this?
M	KURT	What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
M	RAM	Answer him dick!
M	KURT	Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
M	J.D.	It seems to have an open door policy for assholes though, doesn't it?
M	KURT	What did you say dickweed?
M	J.D.	I'll repeat myself.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
F	VERONICA	No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really did was ruin two pairs of pants...Maybe not even that... Can you bleach out urine stains?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
F	VERONICA	Never say never.
M	HEATHER DUKE	What are you going to do, Heather? Take the two shots or send me out?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast? First you ask if you can be red, knowing that I'm always red...
M	HEATHER DUKE	Shit.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Damn. It's your turn Heather.
M	HEATHER DUKE	No, it's Heather's turn.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	King David.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	No way, no day!
F	VERONICA	Give it up girl!
M	VERONICA HEATHER MCNAMARA	Holy shit! God, that was unbelievable!
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	What. A. Shot.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
F	VERONICA	Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Why?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Why not?
F	MOM	Heather, your Mother's here.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Come on whoever wants a ride.
M	DAD	Take a break Veronica, sit down.
F	VERONICA	All right.
M	DAD	So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
F	VERONICA	I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
F	MOM	Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
F	VERONICA	I guess.
F	MOM	Any contestants worth mentioning?
F	VERONICA	Maybe. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
M	DAD	Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
F	VERONICA	Because you're an idiot.
M	DAD	Oh yeah, that's it.
F	MOM	You two....
F	VERONICA	Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Corn nuts!
M	J.D. (O.S.)	You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
F	VERONICA	No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well. I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
F	VERONICA	Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
M	J.D.	The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
F	VERONICA	I didn't. Cherry.
F	VERONICA	Great bike.
M	J.D.	Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
F	VERONICA	I don't know. Should you?
M	J.D.	My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
F	VERONICA	Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
M	J.D.	Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
F	VERONICA	Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
F	VERONICA	It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
M	J.D.	I don't really like your friends either.
F	VERONICA	It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
M	J.D.	Maybe it's time for a vacation.
M	DAVID	Throw your coats on the bed, girls.
M	WHINING STUDENT	That exam was so bogus.
M	COED ONE	Oh I know. Which exam?
M	DAVID	Veronica, this is Brad.
M	BRAD	Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying slippers?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Yeah, let's party.
M	DAVID	She loves to party.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Dear Diary, I want to kill and you have to believe.....damn pen!
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	You have to believe it's for more than selfish reasons. More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle. You have to believe me.
M	BRAD	So, are you a cheerleader?
F	VERONICA	No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
F	VERONICA	Gee, thanks.
M	BRAD	It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
M	BRAD	So when you go to college, what kind of subjects do you think you'll study?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Come on David, let's go back to the party.
M	DAVID	Don't worry, we will. You're just so hot tonight. I can't control myself.
M	BRAD	So what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party. I've got the best Windham Hill C.D. collection in the dorm.
M	BIG AMIABLE STUDENT	Brad-man, Robinson's looking for you. He says he owes you for blow and he just got some product himself.
M	BRAD	You're kidding. That pecker actually scored something on his own?
M	BIG AMIABLE STUDENT	He's in Sheila's room, guy. Party up.
M	BRAD	Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine?
F	VERONICA	Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
M	BRAD	Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
F	VERONICA	Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
M	BRAD	Hey, don't run away now. Seventeen is the last year Mom buys the Twinkies. When you make the jump from working weekends at Pizza Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you lose something. Not innocence--power.
F	VERONICA	J.F.K.!
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm allowed an understanding that my parents and these Remington University assholes have chosen to ignore. I understand I must stop Heather.
M	BRAD	How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come on.
F	VERONICA	Hey really, I don't feel so great.
M	BRAD	Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
F	VERONICA	I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
M	BRAD	Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
F	VERONICA	You don't deserve my fucking speech!
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
F	VERONICA	Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	No. Hell no.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West. Or is it East? West! I sound like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing her aerobicized ass but tonight let me dream of a world without Heather. A world where I am free.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	You stupid cunt!
F	VERONICA	You goddamn bitch!
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
F	VERONICA	Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
M	J.D.	Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
F	VERONICA	S'okay....
M	J.D.	I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
F	VERONICA	Sure. But I'm Blue.
M	J.D. (V.O.)	Goddamn, no wonder you looked so mangled when I came through the window.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	I've always treated Heather's teen queen power plays as bullshit.....
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	But I'm really scared. Who am I going to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound like an Afterschool Special. That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
M	J.D. (O.S.)	Well, I don't know. There's something to be said for...Ouch!
F	VERONICA	What a night.
F	VERONICA	What a life. I almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because I was some genius. We all decided to chuck the idea because I'd have trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.
F	VERONICA	Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
M	J.D.	Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
F	VERONICA	Killing her won't solve anything.
M	J.D.	A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
F	VERONICA	Well then, I'll pray for rain.
M	J.D.	See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
F	VERONICA	Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
M	J.D.	Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
F	VERONICA	There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
M	J.D.	I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
F	VERONICA	I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
M	J.D.	Good plan.
F	VERONICA	But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
M	MRS. CHANDLER	We are leaving soon for your grandmother's. If you care to join us...
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Bag that.
M	MRS. CHANDLER	Is that a "No" in your lingo?
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Lingo this.
F	VERONICA	Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
M	J.D.	Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
F	VERONICA	What about orange juice and milk? What's the upchuck factor on that?
M	J.D.	I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
F	VERONICA	Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
F	VERONICA	O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
M	J.D.	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
F	VERONICA	What are you doing? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
M	J.D.	Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
F	VERONICA	Just give me a cup, jerk.
F	VERONICA	Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
M	J.D.	Yeah, great.
F	VERONICA	No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
M	J.D.	Chick-en.
F	VERONICA	You're not funny.
M	J.D.	I'm sorry.
F	VERONICA	Bonehead.
F	VERONICA	Morning, Heather.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
F	VERONICA	We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
M	J.D.	Veronica knew you'd have a hangover. So I whipped this up. Family recipe.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Did you put a phlegm globber in it or something? I'm not drinking that piss.
M	J.D.	I knew this stuff would be too intense.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink it just because you call me chicken.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Just give me the cup, jerk.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Corn nuts!
M	J.D.	Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
F	VERONICA	No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
M	J.D.	And your worst enemy.
F	VERONICA	Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
M	J.D.	What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
F	VERONICA	Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
M	J.D.	I'm just a little freaked, all right? You got what you wanted, you know.
F	VERONICA	It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
M	J.D.	We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
F	VERONICA	Like a suicide thing?
M	J.D.	Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
F	VERONICA	I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
F	VERONICA	"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
M	J.D.	"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
F	VERONICA	That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
M	J.D.	This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
F	VERONICA	She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
M	J.D.	That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
F	VERONICA	You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
M	J.D.	"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
F	VERONICA	That's good. Have you done this before?
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	Any other Principal would take the same position. Keep things business as usual.
M	COUNSELOR HYDE	Heather Chandler's not your everyday suicide. She was very popular.
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	I let the kids go before lunch and the switchboard'll light up like a Christmas Tree.
M	KEVIN STAPLES	The parents will be sympathetic, sir. These are troubled times for the young.
M	MRS. POPE	I must say I was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word "myriad" in her suicide note after brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.
F	PAULINE	I find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words.
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	Oh Christ.
F	PAULINE	The school, meaning both students and teachers, must revel in this revealing moment. I suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk. And feel. Together.
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me when the shuttle lands...Now is this Heather the cheerleader?
M	COUNSELOR HYDE	That would be Heather Mcnamara.
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	Damn. I'd be willing to go half a day for a cheerleader.
M	KEVIN STAPLES	Let's just pack it in an hour early.
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	Done. I hate Mondays.
F	PAULINE	I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled to be given an example of everything I've taught you. That example is Heather Chandler. I have the note!
M	MALE STUDENT	All right!
F	PAULINE	I'll pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?
M	FEMALE STUDENT	I heard it was really gnarly. She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed....
F	PAULINE	Now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions.
M	THE ALL-OUT NERD	Are we going to be tested on this?
M	PETER	Heather and I used to go together, but she said I was boring. I realize now I wasn't really boring. She was just dissatisfied with her life.
F	PAULINE	That's very good Peter.
F	PAULINE	Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
F	VERONICA	Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
F	VERONICA	She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so unfair! We should get a whole week off not just an hour.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Write the School Board.
F	VERONICA	Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
M	HEATHER DUKE	Fuck it.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Look, heather left behind one of her Swatches. She'd want you to have it, Veronica. She always said you couldn't accessorize for shit.
M	FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET	I'm sorry about your friend. I thought she was your usual airhead bitch. Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were.
M	HEATHER DUKE	What a waste.
M	HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)	Oh the Humanity.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Veronica, what are you doing?
M	SQUEALING GIRL	Everyone in the shower!
M	MATT	Do I deliver or do I deliver?
M	RODNEY	Hurry up, we're going to get caught.
M	MATT	Mellow out Geek. Man, I never should have brought you.
M	CLYDE	Let's see some pussy!
M	MATT	Does this have something to do with menstrual cramps and shit?
M	CLYDE	What the fuck?
M	RODNEY	We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I can feel it.
M	CLYDE	What the fuck?
M	STEVE	Do you deliver or do you deliver?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	That was seriously warped, Veronica.
F	VERONICA	Uh-huh.
M	HEATHER DUKE	T.V. cameras!
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!
M	HEATHER DUKE (T.V.)	I choose to remember the good times. Like when we got our ears pierced at the mall.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA (T.V.)	I can still hear those late night talks on the phone.
M	PETER (T.V.)	The day I won her that stuffed rhino at the 4-H Fair, she said to me....
M	VERONICA (O.S.)	You're an asshole! Mute him!
M	J.D.	Mute!
F	VERONICA	Next channel, darling.
M	VERONICA (O.S.)	Heather, how many networks did you run to!
F	VERONICA	Oh, I have to hear this. In my heart, Heather's still alive.
F	VERONICA	What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at?
M	J.D.	Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
F	VERONICA	Yeah. Scary stuff.
M	J.D.	Why son, I didn't hear you come in.
M	FRED DEAN	Hey Dad, how was work today?
M	FRED DEAN	It was miserable. Some damn tribe of withered old bitches doesn't want us to terminate that fleabag hotel. All because Glenn Miller and his band once took a shit there. It's just like Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?
M	J.D.	That was the one with the wheat right?
M	BIG BUD DEAN	The Save the Memorial Oak Tree Society. Showed those fucks.
M	J.D.	Thirty Fourth of July fireworks attached to the trunk. Arraigned but Acquitted.
M	FRED DEAN	Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend.
M	J.D.	Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica.
F	VERONICA	Hello.
M	J.D.	Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
F	VERONICA	My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
M	J.D.	Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad?
M	BIG BUD DEAD	Right, son.
F	VERONICA	Right.
M	DAD	Take a break Veronica, sit down.
F	VERONICA	All right.
M	DAD	So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
F	VERONICA	I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
F	MOM	Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
F	VERONICA	Maybe.
M	DAD	Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
F	VERONICA	Because you're an idiot.
M	DAD	Oh yeah, that's it.
F	MOM	You two....
F	VERONICA	Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
M	FATHER RIPPER (O.S.)	I blame not Heather but rather a society that tells its youth that the answers are on the MTV video games. We must pray the other teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio, know the name of that "righteous dude" who can solve their problems....
M	FATHER RIPPER	It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book. May Heather Chandler rest in peace even though she committed suicide. For-the-kingdom-the-power-and-the- glory-are-yours-now-and-forever-Amen.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA (V.O.)	Oh God, this is a tragic thing and sometimes I have a hard time dealing with it and stuff. Please send Heather to heaven and all that. Thanks. I mean, Amen.
M	PETER (V.O.)	Dear God, make sure this never happens to me. I do not think I could handle suicide and that's the God's honest truth. Pardon the pun. Fast-early-acceptance- into-an-Ivy-League-school-and- please-let-it-be-Harvard. Amen.
M	RAM (V.O.)	Jesus God in heaven, uh, why did you kill such hot snatch. That's a joke, man. People are so serious. Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven, pray for us sinners....so we don't get caught. Another joke, man.
M	HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)	I prayed for the death of Heather Chandler many times and I felt bad every time I did, but I kept doing it anyway. Now I know you understood everything. Praise Jesus. Alleluia.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Hi. I'm sorry. Technically I didn't kill Heather Chandler but hey, who am I trying to kid, right? I just want my high school to be a nice place. Amen. Did that sound bitchy?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
F	VERONICA	Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
F	VERONICA	Heather, I've got something going with J.D.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
M	KURT	We on tonight man?
M	RAM	I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
M	KURT	Pretty weird.
M	KURT	That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
M	RAM	Let's kick his ass.
M	KURT	Cool off, we're seniors.
M	RAM	Goddamn Geek!
M	BRACES	Sit and spin.
M	KURT	That little prick.
M	KURT	All right you piece of shit fag, do you like to suck big dicks?
M	BRACES	Cut it out!
M	KURT	Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.
M	RODNEY	Leave him alone, Kurt.
M	RAM (O.S.)	Say it!
M	BRACES	Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.
M	BRACES	I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm! I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?
M	KURT	I'm sure your friends are happy to hear that. Right, guys?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet lately, consoling me and stuff. It'll be really very. Promise.
F	VERONICA	All right, but I hope it isn't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows.
M	KURT	Is it sleeping, dude?
M	RAM	I think so, man.
M	KURT	Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
M	RAM	Punch it in!
M	KURT	Count of three, guy.
M	KURT AND RAM	One. Two. Three!
M	KURT	"When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing....."
F	VERONICA	Yeah, right, asshole.
M	J.D.	What is this shit?
F	VERONICA	I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
M	KURT	"Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel like making love."
M	J.D.	Another fucking Heather. I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. We've broke through the peer pressure cooker. So what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..
F	VERONICA	So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
M	J.D.	Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
M	KURT	"And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."
M	DENNIS	I'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter, but we're talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I'm not going to blow it.
M	PETER	Great. Heather gets the headline and I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.
F	VERONICA	Hi Guys. I came to check on this week's lunchtime poll topic.
M	DENNIS	Don't worry about it, Veronica, sit down. That funeral yesterday must have been really rough.
F	VERONICA	Oh. Sure.
M	YEARBOOK GIRL	We were, uh, wondering if maybe you had some poems or artwork that Heather did that we could put in the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?
F	VERONICA	The what?
M	YEARBOOK GIRL	Take a look. We'll have a two page layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner.
M	DENNIS	It's more tasteful than it sounds.
F	VERONICA	I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
F	COURTNEY	Like last night, Veronica?
F	VERONICA	I'm sorry? I don't get it.
F	COURTNEY	You did last night.
M	COURTNEY'S FRIEND	Kurt told us of your little date.
F	VERONICA	Yeah. And? I left him drunk and flailing in cowshit.
F	COURTNEY	I don't know. He was really detailed.
M	PETER	Shut up, Courtney.
F	VERONICA	Don't shut up. I'd like to know just what I did.
M	PETER	Let me show you that lunchtime poll topic, Veronica.
M	PETER	I rarely listen to Neanderthals like Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were bent over like a coffee table with Kurt going in one end and Ram coming in the other. Pardon the pun.
F	VERONICA	Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.
F	VERONICA	Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund.
F	VERONICA	Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I didn't expect to be calling either. I guess my emotions took over. I was wondering if you wanted all those things you've been saying to really happen. It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once...... Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.
F	VERONICA	That's right, tonight. In the woods behind the school. Don't forget Ram.
M	KURT	Women.
F	VERONICA	I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
M	J.D.	Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
F	VERONICA	You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
M	J.D.	Do you take German?
F	VERONICA	French.
M	J.D.	These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
F	VERONICA	So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
M	J.D.	We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look like they shot each other. By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school. The note's the punchline. How'd it turn out?
F	VERONICA	First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
M	J.D.	Incredible similarity.
F	VERONICA	Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
M	J.D.	Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
F	VERONICA	We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.
M	J.D.	They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
F	VERONICA	Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
M	J.D.	It doesn't work on small animals!
F	VERONICA	Oh.
M	J.D.	Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
M	J.D.	We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
F	VERONICA	You must have had fun.
M	J.D.	You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
M	J.D.	Perrier water!
F	VERONICA	Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
M	J.D.	This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
F	VERONICA	Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
M	RAM	Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
M	KURT	Shut the fuck up, all right.
M	RAM	Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
M	KURT	Hi Veronica.
F	VERONICA	Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.
M	RAM	So do we just start fucking?
F	VERONICA	I've made a circle on each end of the clearing. Ram, you come over here.
F	VERONICA	When you get in the circle, strip.
M	RAM	What about you?
F	VERONICA	I was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport.
M	RAM	Oh. Good idea.
F	VERONICA	Count of three, guys.
F	VERONICA	One.
F	VERONICA	Two.
M	J.D.	Three.
F	VERONICA	Shucks.
M	J.D.	Did you miss him completely?
F	VERONICA	Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
M	J.D.	Don't move! I'll get him back!
M	J.D.	Now!
M	MILNER	I heard it that time!
M	McCORD	Wha?
M	MILNER	Another gunshot! From the woods!
M	McCORD	Shit, let's roll.
F	VERONICA	Kurt doesn't look too good.
M	J.D.	Remember he's left-handed.
M	MILNER (O.S.)	Keep going until you hit the clearing!
M	McCORD	Mother of Shit!
M	MILNER	Call in!
M	MILNER	I heard something out there. I'm checking it out.
M	McCORD	This is Officer McCord and I've got two dead bodies in the woods behind Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.
M	J.D.	Faster!
M	McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)	Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?
M	MILNER	Think what I heard was just a stinking owl. All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. Should I pry them apart?
M	McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)	Forget it. I got all the answers back here, partner.
M	MILNER	What's the deal?
M	McCORD	Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot each other.
M	MILNER	That's Kurt Kelly!
M	McCORD	Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.
M	MILNER	Oh my God, suicide? Why?
M	McCORD	Does this answer your question?
M	MILNER	Oh man, they were fags!
M	McCORD	Listen up, "We could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world."
M	MILNER	Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade magazine Honorable Mention...
M	MILNER	Wait a second. How did they shoot each other if we heard two separate sets of gunshots?
M	McCORD	Shit, I always hear gunshots when I'm high. Life is one crazy bitch. Don't try to analyze it. The quarterback buggering the linebacker. What a waste.
M	MILNER	Oh the humanity.
M	KEVIN STAPLES	After every touchdown or whatever, they give each other a little slap on the bottom. It seems innocent...
M	PAULINE (O.S.)	Shut up.
M	MRS. POPE	Look at this. "Ununderstanding."
F	PAULINE	Will you shut up! We were in a similar position Monday and I thoughtfully suggested that we get the students together for an unadulterated emotional outpouring. You took the suggestion as an opportunity to play yet another round of "Let's laugh at the Hippie."
M	COUNSELOR HYDE	Pauline, if you want a tryout for the school play....
M	PRINCIPAL GOWAN	Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of bullshit--angel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography exhibits involving tennis racquets, but this suicide thing....I guess it's all on Pauline's wavelength. We're just going to write off today, and Friday she can do her little little love-in or whatever. Whatever.
F	VERONICA	We killed them, didn't we?
M	J.D.	Of course.
F	VERONICA	Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
M	J.D.	You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
F	VERONICA	I did not want them dead.
M	J.D.	Did to.
F	VERONICA	Did not.
M	J.D.	Did to.
F	VERONICA	Did not.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Ah, young love.
M	SQUEELING GIRL	Did you hear? School's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact.
M	HEATHER DUKE	No way!
M	J.D.	Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
F	VERONICA	Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
M	MR. KELLY	If there's any way you can hear me, Kurt buddy, I don't care that you really were some pansy. You're my flesh-and-blood. You made me proud. I love my homosexual son. My son's gay and I love him!
F	VERONICA	Your son's dead and you love him.
M	J.D.	How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
F	MOM	How was the funeral?
F	VERONICA	Superb.
M	WHITNEY JAMES (T.V.)	It looks like the teen suicide epidemic has hit home in Sherwood as the death toll at Westerburg High rockets to three.
M	WHITNEY JAMES (T.V.)	Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
F	VERONICA	That's three things.
M	WHITNEY JAMES (T.V.)	It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
M	ANCHORMAN (T.V.)	Thanks Whitney, but I hate to say it. It looks like you brought that rainy weather back with you. Tomorrow's forecast calls for...
F	VERONICA	No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	The most popular people in the school are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing but what really frightens me is that I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do next. It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing....
F	PAULINE	Peter, kill the jukebox.
F	PAULINE	Could I have your attention?
F	PAULINE	tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it back together through love! I want everyone to clasp hands. We need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit. Let's begin a new happiness!
F	PAULINE	Yo, what's the problem? I know you know how to hold hands. Ring-around- the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy...Forget it! I'm just so thrilled to announce that Whitney James of WETC News is taping a rap session with students from area high schools including Westerburg.
F	PAULINE	Let's show the world Westerburg is a diverse happy home, not Suicide Central! You know there's some people who say Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on T.V. Is that true?
F	PAULINE	No or Hell No?
M	STUDENTS	Hell no!
F	PAULINE	I can't hear you....
M	STUDENTS	HELL NO!
F	VERONICA	Can't you see this is a special moment?
M	J.D.	I was just making it more special. Veronica, there you are!
F	PAULINE	You people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special. Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.
M	PETER	Westerburg? A happy family?
F	PAULINE	I'm sure you'll work something out.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Don't worry. We'll work something out.
F	VERONICA	Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
M	J.D.	Greetings and salutations.
F	VERONICA	You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
M	J.D.	She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
F	VERONICA	Don't even talk about that stuff!
M	J.D.	You mean the time you blew Kurt Kelly's ass away!
F	VERONICA	You can be so immature!
M	J.D.	You kids are making too much damn noise.
M	FRED DEAN	We beat the bitches.
F	VERONICA	Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.
M	FRED DEAN	Judge told em to slurp shit and die.
M	FRED DEAN	I put a Norwegian in the boiler room. Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs.
M	FRED DEAN	It's great to be alive!
F	VERONICA	Do you like your father?
M	J.D.	Never given the matter much thought. Liked my mother.
M	J.D.	They said her death was an accident. But she knew when the explosives were set to go off. She knew...
F	VERONICA	Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
M	J.D.	Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
F	VERONICA	Maybe.
M	J.D.	Whoa! Amazing!
M	BIGFUN (T.V.)	TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW! PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW!
M	J.D.	It's the new BigFun video!
M	BIGFUN (V.O.)	BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO!
M	BIGFUN	TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
M	J.D.	We've made MTV.
F	VERONICA	We're breaking up. I am out!
M	J.D.	Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
F	VERONICA	You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
M	J.D.	Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
F	VERONICA	I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
M	J.D.	Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
M	HEATHER DUKE	What the.....
M	HEATHER DUKE	Where did you get these?
M	J.D.	Oh, I just had the nicest chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
M	HEATHER DUKE	What do you want from me?
M	J.D.	Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
M	HEATHER DUKE	But she couldn't handle it.
M	J.D.	I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Very very. The photographs?
M	J.D.	Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
M	J.D.	In the meantime, strength, And hey, there's a little gift.
M	EARL	Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
F	VERONICA	Something like that. Will you do it?
M	EARL	Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
F	VERONICA	I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
M	EARL	I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
F	VERONICA	Things are going to change, Earl.
M	EARL	Uh-huh.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Guess who?
F	VERONICA	Heather.
F	VERONICA	Ouch. Your machine's got the most obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.
M	VERONICA (O.S./machine)	I'm just calling to say you can wear your hair any way you want to.
M	DAVID	Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on anybody's carpet lately?
F	VERONICA	Is this David? Heather's David? What are you doing....
M	DAVID	What can I say? I was pretty broken up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.
F	VERONICA	I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on?
M	DAVID	She can't really talk right now.
F	VERONICA	Hello, Betty.....
F	BETTY	I don't believe it. I'm winning.
F	VERONICA	Don't get cocky, girl.
F	BETTY	I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
F	VERONICA	That's bullshit. Just shoot.
F	BETTY	Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
F	VERONICA	Shoot.
F	VERONICA	Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
F	BETTY	Ronnie!
F	BETTY	Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
F	VERONICA	It's not my style, okay?
F	BETTY	Nice guys finish last. I should know.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Brav-o!
M	BETTY FINN	I've got to get going, Veronica. See you at the studio.
F	VERONICA	Sure. See ya.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Croquet won't be the same without Heather.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn't going to be taped at the studios. It's going to be done in the Park.
F	BETTY	But I thought...
M	HEATHER DUKE	It's going to be like a big picnic. Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED!
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Shit.
F	VERONICA	So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
M	HEATHER DUKE	Back off. I called everyone, even that Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!
F	VERONICA	You're so polluted. Talking down to people, making fake notes....
M	HEATHER DUKE	I don't see what gives you the right to lecture, Ronnie. You were soulmates with Betty Finn until you realized you're the cover of Seventeen magazine and she's the before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Some people just don't matter. Why should those who do carry their weight? Am I right?
F	VERONICA	No, you're wrong. It's not even your turn.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	She's right.....Boy, croquet's not the same without Heather.
F	VERONICA	Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk.
M	PETER DAWSON	Veronica, I thought we lost you.
F	VERONICA	I was waiting for my friend Betty.
M	PETER DAWSON	Teens talking it out on T.V.! Would it be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my Princeton application?
F	VERONICA	Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete.
M	PETER DAWSON	This is excellent, but I thought we were going to get equal representation on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads...
M	HEATHER DUKE	They're probably just being fashionably late.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Is this very or what? Oh, you've gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!
M	HEATHER DUKE	Whitney, here's my friend.....
M	WHITNEY JAMES	Ah please sit down.
M	WHITNEY JAMES	I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
F	VERONICA	But my name's not...
M	WHITNEY JAMES	People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
F	VERONICA	I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
M	WHITNEY JAMES	Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
M	WHITNEY JAMES	I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's exciting stuff. My personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a B.M.W. on their birthday, they're still quote-unquote depressed. It's ridiculous. People who say money can't buy happiness don't know where to shop.
M	CLYDE	What the fuck?
F	VERONICA	The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
M	WHITNEY JAMES	Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
F	VERONICA	It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
M	WHITNEY JAMES	Sure. Ciao.
F	PAULINE	Everyone take their places on the stage! Isn't this thrilling?!
F	VERONICA	But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
F	PAULINE	What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. Could we get some more light up here?
F	PAULINE	Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy. Let's fuse them back together through love. Let's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove.
M	PAULINE (O.S.)	Let's begin a new happiness...
F	PAULINE	...with no more suicide...
M	STUDENTS	Oh yeah...
M	J.D.	Holy traumatic experiences, Batman. I'm sorry you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit. I told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in the past already, right?
F	PAULINE	No more problems....
F	VERONICA	Oh yeah.
M	J.D.	Cute.
M	WHITNEY JAMES	Let's go for another take.
M	CASHIER	Bargain matinees are for the first show only.
F	MARTHA	Oh, I forgot.
M	DAD	Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
F	VERONICA	Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
F	MOM	I don't know what you're talking about, honey, but can it wait a bit. We're watching this special program on Teen Problems.
M	DAN RATHER VOICE (O.S.)	Oh sure, I'll bet even back when I went to school there were drugs, even sex, but they were simpler times. The Sherwood suicides tell the bitter truth of today's young. What a waste...Oh
F	MOM	Turn that back on!
F	VERONICA	This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
M	DAD	If we're not going to watch that program, can I put on the game?
F	MOM	Are you trying to tell me it is not a troubled time for the nation's youth?
F	VERONICA	Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
F	MOM	I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
F	VERONICA	All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
M	DAD	I don't patronize bunny rabbits.
F	MOM	Treated like human beings? Is that what you said little Miss Voice of a Generation? Just how do you think adults act with other adults? You think it's all just Doubles Tennis. Adults can be horrible to other adults. When teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings, it's usually because they are being treated like human beings.
F	VERONICA	I guess I picked the wrong time to be a human being.
F	MOM	You'll live. Want some pate?
M	HEATHER DUKE	Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
F	VERONICA	Is she dead?
M	HEATHER DUKE	That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
F	VERONICA	I said I was sorry.
M	HEATHER DUKE	You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
F	VERONICA	You're not funny. Ouch!
M	HEATHER DUKE	What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
F	VERONICA	Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Oh shit, yeah. I know it's supposed to be funny that they never get off the island, but still, sometimes I feel like I'm on that island and Gilligan can be just so stupid sometimes.
M	HEATHER DUKE	This sounds like a good one.
M	D.J.	Dude, you've got to remember if it wasn't for the courage of the fearless crew, the Minnow would be lost. The Minnow would be lost! Next call!
M	TROUBLED MALE VOICE	But Skipper hates me....
M	D.J.	Whoa, they're coming out early tonight. What ever happened to teen pregnancy and acne? You've got the Dogcatcher on W etcetera and you're listening to Hot Probs. Who am I talking to?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that. Hey babe, I need a name?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA (box)	My name is Minnie.
M	D.J.	Ah, Minnie. Don't tell me, Mickey just confessed he got A.I.D.S. from Goofy at a New Year's Eve Party.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	God has cursed me, I think. The last time I had sex, the guy killed himself the next day. I'm failing Math.
M	HEATHER DUKE HEATHER MCNAMARA (radio)	Holy shit, that's My whole life is a mess. Heather! We'll I was supposed to be crucify her! captain of the cheerleading team, but I probably won't VERONICA because I miss practice when Oh man, she knows we my Dad visits. My parents
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Heather told everyone about Heather.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head has sprouted in its place like some mythological thing my eighth grade boyfriend would know about. Heather's even doing the old note trick.
M	VERONICA (V.O.)	I did it J.D.'s way. I did it Pauline's way. Nothing's changed. I guess that's Heather's way. And jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom? Or to Hell? And where's Heather going?
M	GRUFF TEACHER	Where's Heather going?
M	HEATHER DUKE	She's going to cry-y-y.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Fucking child protector caps.
M	GRUFF TEACHER	Now where's she going? Is somebody getting raped today on All My Children or what?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Give me a break.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	What are you trying to do? Kill me?
F	VERONICA	What were you trying to do? Sleep?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Suicide is a private thing.
F	VERONICA	You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
F	VERONICA	If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Probably....
F	VERONICA	Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
M	HEATHER MCNAMARA	Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
F	VERONICA	Sure.
M	J.D.	So it's come to this. Heather Chandler did polls. I want you to do a Petition, as a favor, as the favor. Do you know the group Big Fun?
M	HEATHER DUKE	TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
M	J.D.	Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
M	HEATHER DUKE	I'll get right on it coach. And hey, a little gift. I won't be needing it.
F	COURTNEY	Oh great. Here comes Heather.
M	COURTNEY'S FRIEND	Shit.
M	VERONICA (O.S.)	Heather?
M	HEATHER DUKE	Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me! My God, you haven't signed!
F	VERONICA	People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
M	HEATHER DUKE	So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others.... Hey, just sign the petition!
F	VERONICA	Don't talk to me like that.
M	HEATHER DUKE	It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
F	VERONICA	No.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Jealous much?
F	VERONICA	Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
M	HEATHER DUKE	Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh! Wanna go out tonight?
M	J.D.	Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
F	VERONICA	I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
M	J.D.	I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
F	VERONICA	It's over, J.D. Over!
M	J.D.	I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
F	VERONICA	Yes?
F	MOM	Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by. He seemed very concerned about you. He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself.
M	DAD	You have been depressed lately. Oh, he said this is for you.
F	VERONICA	Oh my God....
M	MOM (O.S.)	He says we should keep you away from sharp objects, closed garages, toxic... "You can't ever find a place nice and peaceful because there isn't any."
M	J.D.	Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey- I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me- so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give it a try, underline something.
F	VERONICA	Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
M	J.D.	"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
M	J.D.	Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
F	VERONICA	Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
F	VERONICA	You're still not listening! I'm not..
M	J.D.	Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
F	VERONICA	This knife is filthy.
M	J.D.	What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
F	VERONICA	I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
M	J.D.	How's this? Can you see your fucking reflection?
F	VERONICA	Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me. Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
M	J.D.	You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
M	J.D.	Perfecto. Man, I've even got a marked-up Catcher in the Rye. What else does a suicide need?
M	J.D.	If you'll excuse me......
F	VERONICA	No-o!
M	FATHER RIPPER	Eskimo.
M	FATHER RIPPER	Heather Duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but I believe the word Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather's pain.
M	FATHER RIPPER	On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral.
F	VERONICA	Heather? Wha...
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
F	VERONICA	What are you doing here?!
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
M	HEATHER CHANDLER	Dinner!
M	MOM (O.S.)	Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!
M	VERONICA (O.S.)	Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A. That is to say, no one but me. I know where J.D. is coming from and where he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going to teach him what's right. I'm going to stop J.D....If it's the last thing I do.
F	MOM	Does she want a written invitation? Veronica! Dinner!
F	MOM	Honey?
M	J.D.	I can't believe you did it. I was teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed up here to kill you, but first I was going to try and get you back. With amazing petition.
M	J.D.	It's a shame you can't see what our fellow students really signed.
M	J.D.	Listen. "We students of Westerburg High will die. Today. Our burning bodies will be the ultimate protest to a society that degrades is. Fuck you all." Not that subtle but neither's blowing up the school. Talk about your suicide pacts. When our school explodes tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of thing that infects a generation. A Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we coulda toasted marshmallows together. Honey, are you all right in there?
F	MOM	Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my baby back! I should have let you keep that job at the mall. I was just afraid of you coming home alone at night!
F	MOM	I made your favorite! Spaghetti! Lots of oregano!
F	VERONICA	Hey Mom, why so tense? I need some help with my homework...
M	J.D.	Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy....
F	PAULINE	Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
F	VERONICA	Where is he? Where's J.D.?
F	PAULINE	We have to talk. Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
F	VERONICA	Get a job.
F	VERONICA	Rodney, where's everybody going?
M	RODNEY	It's Friday.....
F	VERONICA	Oh my God, the damn pep assembly....
M	RODNEY	Yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class...
F	VERONICA	Rodney, what's underneath the gym?
M	RODNEY	The boiler room. May I see your hall pass?
M	J.D.	I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
F	VERONICA	Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
F	VERONICA	Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
M	J.D.	You didn't say Simon Says.
M	J.D.	Live by the sword...
M	J.D.	You think just because you started this thing, you can end it?
M	J.D.	You, really didn't think I'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the....
F	VERONICA	The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do you turn it off? Tell me!
M	J.D.	Fuck you!
F	VERONICA	It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
M	J.D.	You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
F	VERONICA	How do you turn the fucker off?
M	J.D.	You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
F	VERONICA	The bomb, asshole!
M	J.D.	Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
F	VERONICA	You know what I want, babe?
M	J.D.	What?
F	VERONICA	Cool guys like you out of my life.
F	VERONICA	But babe, don't worry, these here were Ich Luge bullets.
M	J.D. (O.S.)	Color me impressed.
M	J.D.	You really fucked me up, Veronica.
F	VERONICA	I thought I...you..
M	J.D.	You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
M	J.D.	Pretend I did blow up the school. All the schools. Now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life?
F	VERONICA	Perfecto.
M	HEATHER DUKE	Veronica, you look like hell.
F	VERONICA	Yeah, I just got back.
M	HEATHER DUKE	What are you doing?
F	VERONICA	Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
F	VERONICA	Hey, Martha, wait up.
F	VERONICA	My date for the prom kind of flaked out on me, so I thought if you weren't doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent some new releases or something. Maybe pop some popcorn.
F	MARTHA	I'd like that.
F	VERONICA	So would I.
