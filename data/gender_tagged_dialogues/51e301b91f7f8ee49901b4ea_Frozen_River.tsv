M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	T.J.	We're out of Capt'n Crunch.
F	RAY	Just give him toast.
M	T.J.	We got no butter, we got no jelly. What are you doing?
F	RAY	Listening for the trucks.
M	T.J.	Are they really coming?
F	RAY	Yeah. Where's dad?
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	Where's dad?
F	RAY	I don't know how he found it, T.J.
M	T.J.	Found what? The money?
F	RAY	I locked it in my glove compartment.
M	T.J.	That was stupid.
F	RAY	Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened. Did you tell him you had it?
F	RAY	Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.
M	T.J.	Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That's the stupidest place you could have put it.
F	RAY	He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!
M	T.J.	Did he leave anything? What are you gonna do?
F	RAY	Nothing.
M	T.J.	You could look for him?
F	RAY	He could be anywhere.
M	T.J.	We should look for him.
F	RAY	Where?
M	T.J.	The Rez,
F	RAY	With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now.
M	T.J.	So let's go, let's find him before he blows it all.
F	RAY	I can't.
M	T.J.	What do you mean?
F	RAY	I just can't do it anymore.
M	T.J.	But he'll lose it all.
F	RAY	T.J., we can't make him stop.
M	T.J.	He stole our money. Call the Troopers.
F	RAY	It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.
M	T.J.	So you're just gonna sit there?
F	RAY	I'm sorry.
M	T.J.	Another Christmas in the tin crapper.
M	RICKY	Is it here?
F	RAY	Hey, little sleepy head.
M	RICKY	Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.
F	RAY	Wait a sec-
M	T.J.	Get down.
F	RAY	We're all ready for ya'.
M	VERSAILLES	We'll need the balloon payment to unload.
F	RAY	We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-
M	VERSAILLES	Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?
F	RAY	It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back-
M	VERSAILLES	When's he gonna be back?
F	RAY	As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you.
M	VERSAILLES	This is the second time you've dragged me out here. If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit.
F	RAY	Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house-
M	VERSAILLES	Call me when you have the balloon payment.
F	RAY	I'll call you...
M	RICKY	Wait, where are they going?
F	RAY	Listen to me. We'll get them back.
M	RICKY	But why are they leaving?
F	RAY	Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey.
M	RICKY	That's our house!
F	RAY	We're gonna get it back. You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus. Let's get your clothes on, Ricky.
M	T.J.	I can get a job you know.
F	RAY	You're 15, T.J.
M	T.J.	They won't ask any questions.
F	RAY	You're finishing school.
M	T.J.	Come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at All for a Dollar do you?
F	RAY	You're going to school.
M	T.J.	I bet I could make more than you do.
M	RICKY	Where's daddy?
F	RAY	He'll be back.
M	T.J.	Aren't we even gonna look for him?
F	RAY	No! I'm going to work and you're going to school.
M	T.J.	That's it?
F	RAY	The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same.
M	RICKY	Where did he go?
F	RAY	He had to take a business trip.
M	T.J.	Aren't you even gonna look for him?
F	RAY	And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Go on!
M	RICKY	When is daddy coming home?
F	RAY	I don't know, Ricky.
M	T.J.	I can't believe you're not even gonna look for him.
F	RAY	Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer)
M	T.J.	The reservation.
F	RAY	I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now.
M	T.J.	The glove compartment. That's so stupid.
F	RAY	You're going to school. Wait, wait.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Here. Lunch money.
F	RAY	Matt. Could I talk to you?
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I need to come on full-time.
M	MATT	I see you as a short timer.
F	RAY	What is that?
M	MATT	A short timer. Not here for long, not really committed.
F	RAY	When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.
M	MATT	It's my opinion.
F	RAY	Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late. See ya' tomorrow.
M	MOHAWK TEENAGER	Fill it up?
F	RAY	Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four.
M	MOHAWK TEENAGER	Two seventy four.
F	RAY	Make that seven seventy four.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night?
M	MOHAWK TEENAGER	Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked until 9 PM. You can ask inside.
F	RAY	No, that's okay.
M	MOHAWK TEENAGER	Did you want to support our Mosquito Lacrosse League. It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five.
M	MOHAWK TEENAGER (CONT'D)	Thanks, anyway. Have a good day.
F	RAY	Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you...
M	RAY (CONT'D)	You son of a bitch!
M	TICKET TAKER	Sunrise session is almost over. Next session starts at 10:30.
F	RAY	I just need to look inside.
M	TICKER TAKER	It's $5 dollars for admission. I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second.
M	TICKET TAKER	I'm gonna need the five.
F	RAY	I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there.
M	TICKET TAKER	You still gotta pay admission.
F	RAY	He's gambling away the money for our house.
M	TICKET TAKER	What does he look like?
F	RAY	Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.
M	TICKET TAKER	He's not in there.
F	RAY	Can I just look?
M	TICKET TAKER	I told you, lady, he's not in there.
F	RAY	Hey!
F	RAY	That's my car.
F	LILA	Huh?
F	RAY	What are you doing with my car?
F	LILA	That? I found it.
F	RAY	You stole it.
F	LILA	The keys were in it.
F	RAY	So you just took it...? We'll just see what the troopers say about that. Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here. This is Mohawk territory.
F	RAY	You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Troy, are you in there?
M	RAY (CONT'D)	If you're in there you better come out.
M	RAY (O.S.)	Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy? Troy?
M	RAY (O.S.)	I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.
F	LILA	The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses.
F	RAY	This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys!
F	LILA	This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this.
F	RAY	Then you should quit stealing cars.
F	LILA	I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus.
F	RAY	Did you see where the bus was headed?
F	LILA	New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.
F	RAY	Shit! I'm not leaving this here.
F	LILA	I got a friend who might buy that.
F	RAY	It's not for sale.
F	LILA	He'll pay more than it's worth. Maybe two thousand.
F	RAY	Why's that?
F	LILA	He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks. He don't need papers or anything.
F	RAY	Does he use them to rob banks or something?
F	LILA	All I know is he pays good for a car like this.
F	RAY	Where does he live?
F	LILA	Through the woods. Not far.
F	RAY	What's in it for you?
F	LILA	He'll give me something for finding it.
F	RAY	If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this.
F	LILA	Yeah.
F	LILA	Turn up there.
F	RAY	Where?
F	LILA	Where that stump is.
F	RAY	There's no road.
F	LILA	There's a path.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	It's not far.
F	LILA	Not too fast. There's ruts.
F	RAY	I'm not crossing that!
F	LILA	Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice.
F	RAY	That's Canada.
F	LILA	No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river.
F	RAY	What about the border patrol?
F	LILA	There's no border.
F	RAY	I'm still not crossing that.
F	LILA	Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. (points at the gun).
M	LILA (CONT'D)	They plow it and everything.
F	RAY	This is so fuckin' stupid.
F	LILA	Not too fast, there are ruts.
F	LILA	You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	It's just on the other side of those trees.
F	LILA	Honk the horn.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Just keep your mouth shut.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Just keep it shut. Okay?
M	JIMMY	Thunder! SHUT UP!.
M	JIMMY (CONT'D)	Get back under there!
F	LILA	Hi, Jimmy.
M	JIMMY	He don't like whites, Lila.
F	LILA	Sorry.
M	JIMMY	And your late.
F	LILA	Sorry.
M	JIMMY	I shouldn't even be dealing with you.
F	LILA	I know. Sorry.
F	LILA	Count it.
F	RAY	What's going on here?
F	LILA	Just count it.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	How much is there?
F	RAY	Twelve hundred.
F	LILA	Let's go.
F	RAY	Wait, who the fuck are they?
F	LILA	Just back up.
F	RAY	I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk.
F	LILA	I'll give you half. Now let's go.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Let's go!
F	RAY	I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime.
F	LILA	There's no border here. This is free trade between nations.
F	RAY	This isn't a nation.
F	LILA	Let's go.
F	LILA	Why'd your husband leave you?
F	RAY	Fuck you.
F	LILA	Maybe he wanted a younger women. That's what usually happens.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	I never have to worry about that. My husband is dead. Went down in the river on a run. They never found him. Probably tangled in river weeds.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	You better slow down there are ruts out here. You could get stuck in one.
F	LILA	Keep going.
F	RAY	What if the troopers stop us.
F	LILA	They won't stop you. You're white.
F	LILA	Pull around back then wait for him to come to the window.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Roll down your window.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Count it.
F	RAY	Twelve hundred.
F	LILA	Let's go.
F	LILA	Turn down there.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Stop here.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Now open the door.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Open the door.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Now get out.
F	RAY	You can't have my car.
F	LILA	Get out.
F	RAY	You can't have my car. No!
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Fuckin' bitch!
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Little bitch!
F	RAY	I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here.
M	T.J.	If I get it working I can sell it.
F	RAY	I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here!
M	T.J.	Rentaworld called. They're coming to get the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow. Did you find him?
F	RAY	No. Where was the car?
F	RAY	At the bus stop on the Rez.
M	T.J.	I bet he went to Atlantic City.
F	RAY	You don't know that.
M	T.J.	Yeah, but you could figure it out. Just find out what buses came through last-
F	RAY	And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No.
M	T.J.	What happened to your face?
F	RAY	Nothin'.
M	T.J.	What, did you get in a fight with somebody?
F	RAY	It was no big deal.
M	T.J.	You got in a fight, for real?
F	RAY	Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car.
M	T.J.	No way. I say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass.
F	RAY	It doesn't matter.
M	T.J.	Where's your car?
F	RAY	I'll get it tomorrow.
M	T.J.	You left it on the rez? That's so stupid.
F	RAY	I didn't have a tow rope.
M	T.J.	I still say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass.
F	RAY	Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?
M	T.J.	That would be kinda miraculous since there's no food in the house.
F	RAY	There's food.
M	T.J.	Popcorn and Tang.
M	MIKE	Hi, Lila
F	LILA	Mike.
M	MIKE	How's life at the Bingo Palace.
F	LILA	Good. How's business?
M	MIKE	Oh, you know, okay.
F	LILA	How much for that one?
M	MIKE	Come on, Lila.
F	LILA	What?! I've been saving up.
M	MIKE	You know what.
F	LILA	Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole life?
M	MIKE	No, but he said not to sell you a car.
F	LILA	I gotta walk down 37 with the semis kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just to get to the work.
M	MIKE	For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a Horizon and a Civic.
F	LILA	I don't like Chevettes.
M	MIKE	I figured.
F	LILA	I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu.
M	MIKE	Nothing with a trunk.
F	LILA	That thing has been sittin' here for six months.
M	MIKE	I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay?
F	LILA	He doesn't have to know.
M	RICKY	Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house?
F	RAY	They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China.
M	RICKY	Then what?
F	RAY	They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it.
M	RICKY	Then what?
F	RAY	They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar.
M	RICKY	And you can buy me some?
F	RAY	That's right.
M	RICKY	Yes!
M	T.J.	I'm not eatin' that again for dinner.
F	RAY	We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday.
M	T.J.	What about Rentacenter?
F	RAY	What about them?
M	T.J.	They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock.
F	RAY	You told me that already.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Here, lunch money.
M	T.J.	Look I don't see why you won't just let me get a job with Mitch. Who's Mitch.
M	T.J.	He's got like this whole business he runs.
F	RAY	He sells pot to kids?
M	T.J.	No, it's computers. He works on computers.
F	RAY	You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it.
M	T.J.	That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV while I'm sitting in some Christmas assembly when I could be-
F	RAY	Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him?
M	T.J.	I still say we should go back to the rez, get the Horizon and kick some serious butt.
F	RAY	I want my part.
M	RAY (O.S.)	You hear me!
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I want my part.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I want my part.
F	LILA	I'll give you the money if you give me the car.
F	RAY	No way.
F	LILA	The money's gone.
F	RAY	Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese.
F	LILA	It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed. I froze last night.
F	RAY	I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal.
F	LILA	It's not a crime.
F	RAY	You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double.
F	LILA	I don't usually work with whites.
F	RAY	Suit yourself.
F	LILA	How many bedrooms?
F	RAY	Three. I got kids.
F	LILA	How old?
F	RAY	Five and Fifteen.
F	LILA	I got a boy. Almost one.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a moment) She stole him from me.
F	RAY	Stole him?
F	LILA	Yeah. Right out of the hospital.
F	RAY	Stole him?
F	LILA	Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that.
M	JIMMY	Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told him no.
F	LILA	Thanks.
M	JIMMY	I don't want any trouble with him, Lila.
F	LILA	Don't worry about it.
M	JIMMY	This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino.
F	LILA	Okay.
F	RAY	What's going on?
F	LILA	We gotta pick them up.
F	RAY	Where?
F	LILA	Not far.
F	RAY	Where's that?
F	LILA	An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days.
F	RAY	What the hell is he doing?
F	LILA	Keep that thing down.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Roll down the window and see what he wants.
F	RAY	What the hell is going on here?
F	LILA	Just roll it down.
M	BRUNO	D'ey don't like de women driver.
F	LILA	Count it.
F	RAY	Twelve hundred.
F	LILA	Open it.
M	BRUNO	D'is will keep d'em from running.
F	RAY	Why would they want to run?
F	LILA	To get away from the snakeheads.
F	RAY	What's that?
F	LILA	The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe .
F	RAY	How much does it cost?
F	LILA	Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where they're coming from.
F	RAY	To get here?
F	LILA	Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off.
F	RAY	To get here? No fuckin' way.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	God those are ripe.
F	LILA	They always stink.
M	T.J.	-Hello (in a grown-up voice) Is this Mrs. Irene ThreeRivers? -Mrs. Bonaparte, I have good news.
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	-I'm the business manager of Mr. E.F. ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to inform you that you have inherited money. -Are you still there? -Wait, I don't WANT any money, I want to GIVE you money. -That's right. You have inherited money from his computer fortune. -He was the second richest man next to Bill Gates. -He left you Twenty-six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.(pause) -TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS! -Oh no, you have no obligation whatsoever, Mrs. ThreeRivers, just a small processing fee of 29.00 dollars will authorize me to send out your first payment of thirteen-thousand three hundred and seventy five dollars. -You can put it on any major credit card. (pause) Of course, you can always refuse the money. -Sure, I can hold.
F	RAY	Are they always there?
F	LILA	Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason.
F	RAY	Have you ever gotten caught?
F	LILA	Once.
F	RAY	What happened?
F	LILA	They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail.
F	RAY	What did you do?
F	LILA	I paid the fine. I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too.
F	RAY	Smuggling?
F	LILA	Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese.
F	LILA	Count it.
F	RAY	Right, I know. Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna get stiffed.
F	RAY	Then why don't you count it?
F	LILA	I got bad eyes.
F	RAY	You're welcome.
F	LILA	What about mine?
F	RAY	We're even now. My mom told me to give you her credit card number.
M	RENTACENTER MAN	We only take cash or money orders.
M	T.J.	Well, my Mom might be late.
M	RENTACENTER MAN	She's got three minutes.
F	RAY	It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right?

M	T.J.	Where'd you get that?
F	RAY	Matt made me an assistant manager.
M	T.J.	No way.
F	RAY	Is that so hard to believe?
M	T.J.	It's been like two years.
F	RAY	Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not?
F	EVELYN	Chance! Chance, get in here before you freeze your ass off. Temps will dip tonight and tomorrow. Expect a Clipper from Northern Ontario to bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds gusting 25-45 miles an hour making it feel like minus 30. Area farmers are advised to bring in livestock.

M	TROY (O.S.)	Hey, I just got done here. I made two hours overtime fixing one of the snow- making machines. Pretty cool, huh? I'll be home late. I'm gonna catch that meeting at 7:30. Love you, bye.

M	BERNIE	Rita said you quit.
F	LILA	She fired me.
M	BERNIE	That's not what she said.
F	LILA	Well, she should have. I can't see to count the money. I told you that. I come up short half the time.
M	BERNIE	Then get some glasses.
F	LILA	They make me carsick.
M	BERNIE	Gimme a break.
F	LILA	So where are we going?
M	BERNIE	The Tribal Council needs someone to answer phones.
F	LILA	No way!
M	BERNIE	Why not? You can answer a phone, can't you?
F	LILA	Not there! Not with them.
M	BERNIE	What's that?
F	LILA	I bought it.

F	LILA	Some white lady.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	What? What do you need a car for?

F	LILA	I told Bernie I couldn't see.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Nevermind. I'll go.
F	LILA	We gotta get extra fluid.
F	RAY	I gotta get back before KMART closes.
F	LILA	What for?
F	RAY	I got nothing for under the tree.
F	RAY	Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off?
F	LILA	Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas.
F	RAY	You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today.
F	LILA	Those are Christians. The converted.
F	RAY	From what?
F	LILA	From the Longhouse ways.
F	RAY	That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean.
M	RICKY	Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas.
M	T.J.	What about Santa Claus?
M	RICKY	He's bringing the new house.
F	RAY	Wait. They're not Chinese.
F	LILA	They're "Pakis."
F	RAY	What does that mean?
F	LILA	They're from Pakistan.
F	RAY	Well where's that? I don't know. What difference does it make?
F	RAY	A big difference.
F	LILA	If we wait much longer we won't be able to get back across the river.
F	RAY	Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border.
F	LILA	Do you want the money or not?
F	RAY	I wanna know what's in the bag. What's in there?
F	LILA	They don't understand you.
F	RAY	Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Just hold on a second.
F	RAY	I'll take that.
M	Lila	What are you doing?! Just count the money and let's go.
F	LILA	If we keeps snowing like this we won't be able to get across the river.
F	RAY	I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them.
F	LILA	We don't have time.
F	LILA	Is that a two or a five?
F	RAY	A five.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Shit!
F	LILA	You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper fluid.
F	RAY	I'm not stoppin'.
F	LILA	It's a hundred feet deep out here if we get on black ice What are you doing?
F	RAY	Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	-Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause) -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. (pause) -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep. (pause)
M	RAY (CONT'D)	-No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye. You'd think a new house would be enough.
M	T.J.	-Hi, is Mitch there? (a long pause)
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	-Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about `cause I got one. -How much? -Cool, but the thing is I don't really have any wheels at the moment. -On Moira road off 37. -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no the air stunt challenge set. -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot. Bye. Ricky, time to eat.
M	RICKY	Hey T.J., watch this!
M	T.J.	Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna hurt when you sit down.
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time.
M	DEALER	They say there's a bag.
F	RAY	It was too heavy. We had to unload it.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	What's the matter with her!?
M	DEALER	She had something in the bag.
F	RAY	What is she saying!?
M	DEALER	She says her baby. Her baby was in the bag.
F	RAY	It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag.
F	LILA	We gotta go back.
F	RAY	I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag.
F	LILA	I can't believe you left it out there.
F	RAY	If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it-
F	LILA	We gotta go back.
F	RAY	I know! I know that.
M	MITCH	That's what you wanted, right?
M	T.J.	Close enough.
M	MITCH	Thanks Man, Have a Merry One.
F	LILA	Look, there. Tracks.
F	RAY	Where?
F	LILA	Up there.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Slow down, I don't want to run over it. Stop. I think it was here.
M	RAY'S VOICE	Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you're alive, because the boys are worried about you.
F	LILA	It's dead.
F	RAY	Come on!
F	LILA	It's dead.
F	RAY	Tap the bottom of his feet.
F	LILA	Why?
F	RAY	That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born.
F	LILA	I don't want to touch it.
F	RAY	Well, I can't hold it and drive.
F	LILA	I don't think it matters.
F	RAY	At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up.
F	LILA	But it's too late.
F	RAY	Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold.
F	RAY	Shit!
F	LILA	Calm down.
F	RAY	Oh shit. What do I do?
F	LILA	Calm down. Just pull over.
F	RAY	What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.
F	LILA	He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut.
F	RAY	What if he searches the car. What do we say about-
F	LILA	He won't, just remember you're white.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	License and registration?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)	Could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
F	RAY	I wasn't speeding, was I?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Just step out of the car.
F	RAY	Did I do something?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Ma'am I'm just directing you to step out of the vehicle?
F	RAY	Okay.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Step around to the back of the vehicle.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	See that.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)	Your left rear parking light is not illuminated.
F	RAY	Oh, I didn't know.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)	I'm gonna give you a provisional citation. Get this repaired in the next 48 hours and you'll have no problem.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Thanks.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Who's your friend?
F	RAY	She looks after my kids when I have to work late.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Have an enjoyable Holiday.
F	RAY	Yeah, you, too.
F	LILA	What did he want?
F	RAY	Just a blown out tail light.
F	LILA	That's it?
F	RAY	Yeah.
F	RAY	We gotta take it in. What is it?
F	LILA	It's moving.
F	RAY	What? Are you sure?
F	LILA	Hello little baby.
F	RAY	He was just cold.
F	RAY	We found him.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Come on. Let's go.
F	LILA	He was dead.
F	RAY	He was just cold.
F	LILA	He was dead.
F	RAY	Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life.
F	LILA	That was the Great Spirit, not me.
F	RAY	All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	What? Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double.
F	RAY	Here.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Merry Christmas or whatever.
F	LILA	Yeah.
F	RAY	What's that?
M	T.J.	Hot Wheels.
F	RAY	Where'd you get it?
M	T.J.	I called a friend.
F	RAY	Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know.
M	T.J.	No, its not.
F	RAY	Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news.
M	T.J.	It's not like you were gonna get it.
F	RAY	Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide.
M	T.J.	Oh, yeah. I forgot.
F	RAY	Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	What's that smell?
M	T.J.	Popcorn.
F	RAY	I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I?
M	T.J.	Sorry.
F	LILA	Bernie!
M	RICKY	Daddy?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Is there a Ray Eddy here?
F	RAY	Yes.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Can I speak to you outside for a minute.
F	RAY	I haven't gotten the light fixed-
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	It's not about that. I just have a few questions.
F	RAY	Sure.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	This is about the woman who was with you.
F	RAY	Yes.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	How long have you known her?
F	RAY	Not too long. She looks after my kids.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	She's a smuggler.
F	RAY	Really?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Yes.
F	RAY	Wow. That's a shock.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know.
F	RAY	Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	How did you happen to meet her?
F	RAY	Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.
F	RAY	Oh my God.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids.
F	RAY	Absolutely.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday. Thanks. You, too.
M	RICKY	Why is the police man here?
M	T.J.	Shh.
M	RAY (O.S.)	T.J. could you come out here for a minute.
M	T.J.	What did he want? Did something happen to Dad?
F	RAY	No.
M	T.J.	Then what did he want?
F	RAY	Did you have a fire last night?
M	T.J.	The pipes froze so I fixed `um.
F	RAY	You fixed um? Yeah.
F	RAY	Did you happen to use the blow torch?
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Look at this. We can't live here anymore!
M	T.J.	It's just a tin crapper.
F	RAY	No, it was our house. So, we're gettin' a new one, right?
F	RAY	Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother.
M	T.J.	It's not yours, he gave it to me.
F	RAY	Put it down.
M	T.J.	No!
F	RAY	Put it down.
M	T.J.	Are you gonna shoot me now, too?
F	RAY	Put that thing down!
M	T.J.	Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. Maybe that's why he left.
F	RAY	That was an accident.
M	T.J.	Some accident you shot him in the foot.
F	RAY	He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J. So, he'd done it before.
F	RAY	Gimme that thing.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	T.J. come on now. You can't have it. It's mine.
F	RAY	He was clean for 23 months.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I didn't know how else to keep us together. I mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'.
M	T.J.	Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off a week before Christmas.
F	RAY	I know.
M	TICKET TAKER	The game's over. They're verifying the last winner.
F	RAY	That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.
M	TICKET TAKER	I can't sell you one.
F	RAY	I got money.
M	TICKET TAKER	Sorry.
F	RAY	I just want to buy some scratch cards.
M	TICKET TAKER	Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um there.
F	LILA	I quit smuggling.
F	RAY	T.J. set the trailer on fire.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which I told him not to do touch when I wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out-
F	LILA	I got glasses and now I can see up close.
F	RAY	There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I just need one more run to get the double.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?
F	LILA	I don't want it.
F	RAY	What is it then?!
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag?
M	RAY (CONT'D)	You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby.
F	LILA	I got enough.
F	RAY	Yeah, but you gotta get him first.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun. You should see the inside.
F	LILA	How many bedrooms?
F	RAY	Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.
F	LILA	Wall to wall carpet?
F	RAY	Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze. I'll be back.
M	VERSAILLES	...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up-
F	RAY	I wanna schedule a delivery.
M	VERSAILLES	Give me just a second. What do you want?
M	VERSAILLES (CONT'D)	Is this all of it?
F	RAY	It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow.
M	VERSAILLES	I told you all or nothing.
F	RAY	Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it.
M	VERSAILLES	Can't argue with that. You'll have to sign something, though.
F	LILA	Blow the horn.
M	JIMMY	Heat wave!
F	LILA	You got a run for us, Jimmy?
M	JIMMY	It's pretty slow after Christmas. Unless you wanna to go off the Rez, there's a guy up in Montreal who's usually got heads.
F	LILA	How far?
M	JIMMY	Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch out for the Mounties and the Surete. and...this guy deals in ya' know girls.
F	RAY	Have you ever been there?
F	LILA	A few times. Have you?
F	RAY	No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked to work in his shed, mostly.
F	LILA	Up there. That's it.
F	RAY	Can't miss that.
M	BARTENDER	Oui?
F	LILA	Bruno.
M	BRUNO	You looking for a job.
F	LILA	No, Jimmy called-
M	BRUNO	Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay.
M	BARTENDER	Put your hands up.
M	BRUNO	Okay we go.
M	BRUNO (CONT'D)	D'is way.
M	BRUNO	D'at your car?
M	BRUNO (CONT'D)	Open the trunk.
F	LILA	We need to get paid, first.
M	BRUNO	Oh, yes.
F	LILA	You only got six hundred here.
M	BRUNO	You get the rest at drop off.
F	LILA	It's six hundred apiece.
M	BRUNO	That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now you want to change?
F	LILA	It's twelve hundred.
M	BRUNO	You want to make a problem?
M	BRUNO (CONT'D)	...because you're not making a problem for me. And you're making a problem for them. Let me show you something.
F	LILA	Let's just go.
F	RAY	Okay. We'll take them.
F	LILA	Let's go.
F	RAY	Just open the trunk.
M	BRUNO	You must be the brains of the operation.
F	RAY	Turn around!
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I want the rest.
M	BRUNO	I don't have any more.
F	RAY	Go get it.
M	BRUNO	Give it to her.
F	LILA	Let's get out of here. I'll give you the rest of the money.
F	RAY	No. But thanks.
F	LILA	You're gonna get us all killed.
F	RAY	Put it there.
M	BRUNO	You aren't so smart as you look.
F	RAY	He shot me.
F	LILA	You should'a just taken the money from me?
F	RAY	I'm tired of people stealing from me. Is it all there?
F	LILA	We gotta get outta here, first.
F	RAY	Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there!
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Is it there?
F	LILA	It's all there.
F	RAY	Good.
F	LILA	Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the speed limit. We gotta get off this road.
M	LILA (CONT'D)	Slow down!
F	RAY	I can't.
F	LILA	We gotta get off this road!
F	RAY	How much farther to the reservation?
F	LILA	Just up at the tree line.
F	RAY	What the hell? We're on the reservation.
F	LILA	They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money.
F	RAY	Shit!
F	LILA	That ice is black out here.
F	RAY	Will it hold us?
F	LILA	I don't know.
M	DISPATCHER	...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a vehicle with New York State plates, identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and the suspects are two women, suspected to be carrying illegals...
F	LILA	We gotta crawl out the window.
M	JIMMY	Hi Mom.
F	VELMA	Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more half frozen people in here off the river.
M	JIMMY	We just need to borrow your oven, Mom.
F	VELMA	I don't see how I can get any baking done. I'm supposed to be baking 200 doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen.
M	VELMA (CONT'D)	Sit down, I can't reach up that high.
M	VELMA (CONT'D)	Looks like somebody tried to blow your brains out.
M	VELMA (CONT'D)	Get outta here, Jimmy. They gotta strip down. (to girls) Gimme those jackets.
M	VELMA (CONT'D)	Somebody's been beatin' up on you. You, too.
M	THREE RIVERS	-Good, good Mike. What can I do for you? - -You say non-native smugglers? -A white woman? On the Rez? -I'll look into it and give you a call back. Sure thing. (pause) -I'll take your request to the Tribal Council and give you a call back. -No problem, Mike. You bet.
M	THREE RIVERS	Hi, Rosalie.
F	ROSALIE	Billy.
M	THREE RIVERS	We have a situation with a couple smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know they're on the Rez.
F	ROSALIE	Who is it?
M	THREE RIVERS	Lila Littlewolf and some white woman.
F	ROSALIE	What do the troopers want?
M	THREE RIVERS	A surrender of the two illegals and the Non-Native smuggler. They need an example here.
F	ROSALIE	Do you know where they are?
M	THREE RIVERS	Probably over at Velma's.
F	ROSALIE	What do you think?
M	BARBARA	Turn them in.
F	ROSALIE	What about Lila Littlewolf?
M	BERNIE	We got our own court system.
F	ROSALIE	We don't charge people with smuggling.
M	BARBARA	Maybe we should.
M	BERNIE	If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez.
M	BARBARA	We can expel her.
M	BERNIE	You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is.
F	ROSALIE	She makes the Mohawk people look bad.
M	BERNIE	But she has a Mohawk son.
F	ROSALIE	She cost us a Mohawk son.
M	BERNIE	Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin'
F	ROSALIE	She'll never be anything but a smuggler.
M	BERNIE	We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone.
F	ROSALIE	Then we'll take a vote.
M	JIMMY	Hi, Billy.
M	THREE RIVERS	Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?
M	JIMMY	Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before.
M	THREE RIVERS	Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my back. They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. Is that true, Jimmy? You got white women doing it now? Jesus. (after a moment) Well, if you see any, let me know.
F	RAY	I gotta go. No. You stay here.
M	BERNIE	Hi, Lila.
F	LILA	Hi Bernie.
M	BERNIE	You're in a lot of trouble.
M	BERNIE (CONT'D)	The council voted to expel you.
F	LILA	Expel me?
M	BERNIE	For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind.
F	LILA	They can't do that.
M	BERNIE	They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay.
F	LILA	They've already done that.
M	BERNIE	Believe me, it could get even worse.
F	RAY	I thought this was all legal on the reservation.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Look, I gotta get home.
M	BERNIE	If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila. The troopers want somebody.
F	RAY	But, she's a Mohawk.
M	BERNIE	The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers.
F	RAY	Listen, my kids got no one but me.
M	BERNIE	If you leave she won't see her son again.
F	LILA	Let her go.
M	BERNIE	Lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old.
F	LILA	Just go.
F	RAY	At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?
F	LILA	He might be better off.
M	BERNIE	Jake wouldn't agree with that.
F	LILA	It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go alone. (laughs) I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.
M	BERNIE	He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe.
F	RAY	It's just a few months, right?
M	RAY (CONT'D)	I got baby stuff in the shed.
M	RAY (CONT'D)	Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment) And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay? Okay?
M	RAY (CONT'D)	But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know.
F	LILA	Okay.
F	RAY	And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean. (to Bernie) Go with her. Okay?
M	BERNIE	Sure.
M	RICKY	Can I have more corn?
F	LILA	Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you.
F	EVELYN	What do you want?
F	LILA	I need his coat. Where's his coat?
F	EVELYN	You can't have him.
F	LILA	Say goodbye to your Dudah.
M	BERNIE	She's gonna kill me for taking this out of her car.
F	RAY	How long is it for me. You know if I confess?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	As long as they're not on a watch list. Four months. I don't think you have much to worry about judging from the look of them, probably brought here to work in the sex trade.
F	RAY	Will they get sent back?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Not necessarily. They can apply for asylum.
F	RAY	Can I have a cigarette?
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	Is there somebody I can call for you? To take care of your children.
F	RAY	I got somebody.
M	TROOPER NAPOLI	A relative.
F	RAY	A friend. But I need to call my kid.
M	T.J. (O.S.)	Hello. Hi, Mom.
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	-Mom are you there? What's wrong? -What kinda trouble? -What did you do? -A smuggler!? Holy shit! -Are you in jail? -But are you're going to jail!?
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	-Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But why? I can take care of him, I do it all the time. But I don't see why we need-? -Who? (pause) A baby? No way. -Yeah I know where the stuff is. It's in the shed, but that's so stupid!.
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	-Yeah, I'm here. Somebody's at the door.
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	-Okay. Bye.
M	T.J. (CONT'D)	You're gonna have to get the little pieces up high -- or he'll eat them. sandwiches, badly made.
M	RAY (O.S.)	Hi, (happy) You've reached Ray. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you just as soon as I can.
M	TROY (O.S.)	Ray, are you gonna pick up or not? so I can get home. I'm stuck here. I could already be back at work by now.(pause) Please Ray, I'm at the YMCA in Tampa. I love you. I miss you. Please call me here. Seriously. And tell the boys-
