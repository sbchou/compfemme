M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	NORMA	Did you hear something?
M	ARTHUR	The doorbell.
F	NORMA	Are you sure that was the doorbell? From down below... the DOORBELL rings again.
M	ARTHUR	Yep. Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	What time is it?
F	NORMA	Quarter 'til five. Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe. Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in Someone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes
M	ARTHUR	What is it?
F	NORMA	Someone left a box.
M	ARTHUR	Who?
F	NORMA	I don't know. There was a car waiting... but they drove off. Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	Is that one of my Christmas presents? Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of
M	WALTER	Should I close my eyes?
M	ARTHUR	Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS The box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on
F	NORMA	Is there a note? Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE
M	ARTHUR	It's for you, Norma. Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:
F	NORMA	Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5 Do I know a Mr. Steward? Arthur yawns.
M	ARTHUR	I dunno. You tell us. The box sits on the table between them. Arthur opens up the newspaper. Arthur turns the page.
M	ARTHUR	What kind of car was it?
F	NORMA	I couldn't see. It was dark and 1 didn't have my contacts in.
M	WALTER	Why would they just drive off?
F	NORMA	I don't know. But the bus will be here if five minutes... so eat.
M	WALTER	Last day of school and now it starts to snow?!
F	NORMA	Put on your hat... A young girl, DANA ( 13) is waiting at the end of the
F	DANA	Hi Mrs. Lewis.
F	NORMA	Good morning, Dana. And please call me Norma. You're making me feel old.
M	WALTER	You are old!
F	NORMA	I'm thirty-one!
M	WALTER	To us that's old! You're a geezer!
F	NORMA	Well you'll be a geezer one day too, smarty-pants. Norma closes her eyes, taking in a breath of cold air.
M	WALTER	Why does the bus stop have to be at the end of our driveway? So I can watch my little Walter get on his bus... safe in one piece! Down the street, A SCHOOL BUS begins to crest the hill...
M	WALTER	Please. Go. Inside. You're embarrassing me.
F	NORMA	My love embarrasses you?
M	WALTER	Yes. Yes it does. She begins to walk down the sidewalk... taunting him as the
F	NORMA	What if I give little Walter a little kiss in front of all his friends on the school bus? Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the
F	DANA	Do it! The bus is fast approaching... brakes squealing as it slows
M	WALTER	Don't come any closer! Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus...
F	NORMA	Dana... you're baby-sitting for us tonight, right?
F	DANA	Eight o'clock?
F	NORMA	Eight o'clock.
F	DANA	Okay. Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles
F	NORMA	Bus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas...
M	BUD	Our last day!
M	NORMAL	I know!
M	BUD	It'll all be over soon, Norma. He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then
M	ARTHUR	Do you realize that this is the first time in my life that I will be taking more than a week's vacation, June? Norma arrives in the kitchen. She now has a slight limp.
M	ARTHUR (CONT-D)	And enjoy it! Don't worry about the office!
F	NORMA	Rex Morgan... I need you back here no later than seven. Rehearsal dinner starts at eight. Arthur grabs his BRIEFCASE and a BASKETBALL.
M	ARTHUR	The Viking Squad has a game at four.
F	NORMA	Don't get stuck in Friday traffic...
M	ARTHUR	Okay June. He starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor.
F	NORMA	Not in the house!
M	ARTHUR	How's your foot?
F	NORMA	It's fine. She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the
M	ARTHUR	It's your Christmas present.
F	NORMA	From you? B.
M	ARTHUR	From your secret lover. Mr. Steward. She furrows her brow. I hate you, Rex Morgan MD. I hate you, too.
F	NORMA	Don't be late tonight.
M	ARTHUR	I've got your present at work. It's almost finished. He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave. INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate. The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite
M	RADIO VOICE (V.0.)	It's twenty-three degrees on this December morning here in Richmond... The CAMERA moves over the DOWNTOWN EXPRESSWAY... heavy
M	RADIO VOICE (V.0.) (CONT - D)	The French government, in what was seen here as a gesture to President- elect Jimmy Carter, announced Thursday a further tightening of controls over the exportation of nuclear technology. The CAMERA swoops down alongside the driver's side of She WINKS at someone... then turns a corner and the CAMERA
F	DANA	Why does your mom limp?
M	CHARLES	Yeah... is something wrong with her foot?
M	WALTER	That's none of your business.
M	CHARLES	Dana saw her take her shoe off in the parking lot yesterday.
F	DANA	There's definitely something wrong with her foot. It looks mangled.
M	CHARLES	You didn't say mangled... you said it looked gross. Walter lunges at Charles and pushes him up against the They continue to wrestle awkwardly for a moment against the
M	WALTER	If you ever make fun of my mom again I'll kill you! Walter storms off down the hall.
M	POATES	The uhhh... the board came to a vote last week, so it's official. They've officially cancelled the faculty tuition discount.
F	NORMA	So what does that mean for me?
M	P OATE S	You're going to have to start paying full tuition for your son.
F	NORMA	Starting when?
M	POATES	Next semester. Norma notices a SMALL DROP of BLOOD forming in his right
F	NORMA	Okay.
M	POATES	I'm real sorry about this, Norma.
F	NORMA	Yeah, me too. I've got three weeks to figure out how to tell my son we can't afford to send him to Collegiate any more. The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.
M	POATES	Like I said, I'm real sorry.
F	NORMA	Yeah... your nose is bleeding. Poates reaches for his HANDKERCHIEF and puts it to his face,
F	NORMA	Okay... everyone quiet down! Take your seats! Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside
M	NORMA (CONT-D)	Today is the day many of you have been eagerly awaiting. You get to dissect owl pellets. A MALE STUDENT ( 13) pumps his fist...
M	MALE STUDENT #1	Yes! Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT
M	FEMALE STUDENT #1	This is so gross. Norma sets a tray down in front of Charles.
M	CHARLES	Why do they call it an owl pellet? A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma.
M	MALE STUDENT #2	Because they shit out of their mouths.
F	NORMA	Hey... watch the language. You say another cuss word I've gotta send you to detention, okay?
M	MALE STUDENT #2	Sorry, Mrs. Lewis.
M	FEMALE STUDENT #1	Is it true?
F	NORMA	Is what true?
M	FEMALE STUDENT #1	That owls poo out of their mouths.
F	NORMA	Yes... this is true. The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh.
M	NORMA (CONT-D)	Grey forest owls feed upon field mice, squirrels and small birds. The owl will then regurgitate the bones and waste matter in a ball of black mucous. Inside this mucous you will likely find the entire skeleton of its prey. Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN.
M	NORMA (CONT-D)	I'm going to show you a film about the digestive process of the owl, and how the owl pellet is formed. The classroom whispers with excitement. All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with
M	REPORTER #1	It's been five months since the Viking lander touched down on the surface of Mars. We've seen dozens of photographs of the rock covered surface... what can you now tell us about the tests you've been conducting? Is there any sign of life on the red planet? Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.
M	CAHILL	Well... there are three separate tests that we've been conducting... Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release and Gas Exchange. The first two tests, based on soil samples about 22 centimeters deep, came back negative... and the third is... still pending. Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the Can you elaborate on test number three? Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the
M	CAHILL	The gas exchange experiment measures the production or uptake of C02, nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen during the incubation of the martian soil sample.
M	REPORTER #2	Are you showing us all of the photos? Are there little green men up there? Laughter from the press.
M	CAHILL	Well... there is a possibility that the planet abounds with chemical compounds produced by living systems. Their chemical nature, distribution and structural uniqueness could be used to argue the presence of microscopic living organisms on Mars. As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
M	ARTHUR	It all comes down to water. Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.
M	ARTHUR (CONT-D)	If we find water beneath the surface... and the topographic maps of Utopia Planitia indicate that there were once rivers on the surface of the planet, it's possible that we'll eventually find evidence of life. Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye
M	CAHILL	I'm sorry Arthur, but they've denied your application to be admitted into the astronaut program. Arthur looks crushed.
M	ARTHUR	I see. Can I ask why?
M	CAHILL	I'm sorry, son... but they don't tell us why. Arthur is standing at a LABORATORY TABLE with a WHITE MASK A colleague named WENDELL JAMES ( 29) walks over to see what
M	ARTHUR	Are they really with-holding some of the Mars photos?
M	WENDELL	I don't know, man. Jesus... what's that smell?
M	ARTHUR	It's a salinic compound.
M	WENDELL	What are you making?
M	ARTHUR	Christmas present for Norma. Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an
M	WENDELL	A new prosthesis for her foot?
M	ARTHUR	Yep. Arthur carefully impresses the MOLD of his wife's foot into
M	WENDELL	What did you change up this time?
M	ARTHUR	The compound they're developing for the pilot chairs on the space shuttle. The tray belongs to Charles, and he has grown tired of He looks up to the head of the class and sees that Norma is
M	CHARLES	Mrs. Lewis? She raises her head.
F	NORMA	Hmmm?
M	CHARLES	What happened to your foot? She just stares at him.
F	NORMA	What happened... to my foot?
M	CHARLES	Yeah. My friend... she saw you take your shoe off. She said... that there's something wrong with it. The whole class goes silent. Norma begins to blush. She looks
F	NORMA	Well... it's a long story. She looks at her watch.
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	We've got five minutes until second period. She looks back at her class and sees that their curiosity has
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	Alright... I'll tell you what happened to my foot.
M	ARTHUR	When she was seventeen... still living in Texas, her brother dropped a barbell on her foot... broke three of her toes.
F	NORMA	And so I go to see the doctor. He goes to take an X-ray of my foot to see if the bones are broken.
M	ARTHUR	So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor takes the x-ray... then he goes to check on another patient down the hall. Arthur discards a king.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	This dumb--ass... he left the x-ray machine on.
M	WENDELL	Jesus. That's not good.
F	NORMA	They found out that the tissue in four of my toes had been completely
M	I	destroyed by the radiation. Norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	So they have to amputate four of my toes. And then they had to take a bunch of skin from my inner thigh to cover the front of my foot. This is back in 1963... so they didn't have the skin graft techniques they do now.
M	ARTHUR	She had to sit there in a hospital bed in the same position for six months, waiting for it to heal. Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table.
M	WENDELL	Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot.
M	ARTHUR	Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won.
M	WENDELL	What was the settlement?
M	ARTHUR	Forty thousand dollars. Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop... and we
F	NORMA	You guys want to see it? Now that the secret is out... I don't want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot. The class responds enthusiastically. Come on... gather round... take a look at the freak show. As the kids gather around... Norma removes her right shoe and
M	ARTHUR	If this sucker works... she can, start jogging again.
F	DANA	I'm sorry I said that her foot looked gross.
M	WALTER	It doesn't look gross... it looks cool. And if you can't tell the difference between gross and cool... then I feel sorry for you, Dana. Walter walks off... leaving her alone.
F	NORMA	Hey honey.
M	WALTER	Why do I need a baby-sitter?
F	NORMA	Because you're nine years old. You're not a geezer yet.
M	WALTER	It's 1976, mom. Times are changing. Nine years old isn't what it used to be. I think I'm ready to get a moped.
F	NORMA	We're not buying you a moped, Walter. Stick with the bike... and be home before dark.
M	WALTER	Fine. Walter rides off down the street.
F	NORMA	Hello? There is silence on the other end of the line.
M	NORMA (CONT-D)	Hello? A MOMENT OF SILENCE... then the caller disconnects.
M	WENDELL	How's the commute back to Richmond?
M	ARTHUR	Not too bad. Maybe an hour and twenty minutes.
M	WENDELL	Tell Norma I said hello. Wendell watches him walk across the lawn to the parking INSERT: His watch shows that it is 4:58 PM.
M	ARLINGTON	Mrs. Lewis?
F	NORMA	Yeah.
M	ARLINGTON	My name is Arlington Steward. Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box. Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep
M	ARLINGTON (CONT-D)	I assume you received the box that I left on your doorstep. His speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends
F	NORMA	Oh, yes. Yes we did.
M	ARLINGTON	And you retrieved the button unit inside of the box. Norma smiles. He smiles back at her.
F	NORMA	The button unit. That's what you call it?
M	ARLINGTON	Indeed. May I come in?
F	NORMA	Sure. Norma turns and leads him back into the kitchen. She
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	So what it this thing? I assume you're trying to sell me something?
M	ARLINGTON	Well... in a way, yes. I do have an offer to make.
F	NORMA	Yeah? What are you selling?
M	ARLINGTON	A financial opportunity. Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	May I? She nods. He places the briefcase down on the table. He then withdraws a SMALL YELLOW ENVELOPE from his suit
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	inside of this envelope is a key.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	This is the key that opens the glass dome of the button unit. Arlington then inserts the key into a small HORIZONTAL SLOT The METAL BUTTON is now exposed. If you push the button, one of two things will happen. First, someone... somewhere in the world... who you do not know... will die. Norma just stares at him.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Then, you will receive a payment of two-hundred thousand dollars... tax free. Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	The money will be delivered to you in cash. Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much
F	NORMA	Are you for real? Arlington smiles back at her.
M	ARLINGTON	Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that the offer is real.
F	NORMA	Who do you work for?
M	ARLINGTON	The guarantee of payment has several restrictions. One... I am not permitted to disclose any information about to the identity of my employers. Two... if you discuss the details of this financial opportunity with anyone other than your husband, the offer is null and void, and you will not receive the money in return for having pushed the button. Three... you have twenty four hours. Arlington glances at his watch.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	You have until five o'clock tomorrow evening to make your decision whether or not to push the button. At that time, I will return to retrieve the button unit from you. It will be re-programmed and the offer will be made to someone else. Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Until then... a good day to you, Mrs. Lewis. He nods his head and turns toward the foyer.
F	NORMA	Wait a minute... you're just going to leave me with this thing. Is this some kind of joke? Who are you? He opens the front door and turns back to her with a friendly
M	ARLINGTON	My name is Arlington Steward, and I can assure you that this is no joke. The offer is real, but I am not at liberty to disclose any more information than I already have. He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Good day. He heads down the walk toward his car. She looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed She turns the card over and sees what looks like a PHONE She stands there in the doorway and watches him step into the He turns to face her.
M	WALTER	What do you want?
F	DANA	I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell you... that I think your mom is beautiful. Walter just stares at her in silence... wanting to forgive She stares at the button for a long moment... then closes the
M	SUSAN	Hello? Hey mom.
M	SUSAN	Hey honey. What's up? Nothing... I just... The CAMERA continues to zoom out, revealing her husband, JIM
M	SUSAN	Is something wrong?
F	NORMA	No... something just happened and... What?
F	NORMA	Nothing. I don't want to talk about it right now.
M	SUSAN	Alright. Jim... you gotta get ready.
M	JIM	Alright. He sits up and moves toward the stairs.
M	SUSAN	Wait until you see the spread tonight.
F	NORMA	Hmmm. I think they're spending more on their wedding than we did on our house.
M	SUSAN (PHONE)	Is your foot acting up again? Norma leans against the wall... lifting her right foot off
F	NORMA	A little, yeah. That damn bone. The skin from my leg, it's not as tough as it should be. You know he's gonna be there tonight.
F	NORMA	Who?
M	SUSAN	Dr. Stupid. Norma takes this in... remembering...
F	NORMA	Well... it's been what... thirteen years? Bound to run into each other at some point, right?
M	EARRINGS.	As she steps into an elegant COCKTAIL DRESS... we see the
F	NORMA	What's this?
M	ARTHUR	A little gift from Dr. Rex Morgan. She opens the present and retrieves the PROSTHESIS.
F	NORMA	Oh my god! Norma removes an old, store-bought INSOLE from her right shoe
M	ARTHUR	It's a material they developed for the new shuttle chairs. It'll absorb the pressure of your foot and re-distribute it across the entire surface area. She then slides her disfigured foot into the shoe... and
F	NORMA	Oh my God, Rex... how'd you do it?
M	ARTHUR	I just figured out a way to make it better. She crosses the room and gives him a hug and a kiss.
F	NORMA	I don't know what I'd do without you.
M	ARTHUR	Merry Christmas, June. The box is sitting between them.
M	WALTER	Did Mr. Steward show up? Norma sees the box sitting there and immediately grabs it off
M	ARTHUR	Yeah... what's it all about. Did he show up?
F	NORMA	Yeah... I'll tell you about it in the car. We're running late. Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek. We'll be home late... your bedtime is ten. Dana watches them go... her eyes transfixed on the box in
F	NORMA	And before I could ask him anything else... he got in his car... and he pulled off.
M	ARTHUR	Did you get the license plate?
F	NORMA	No.
M	ARTHUR	Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get the license plate number.
F	NORMA	I was little overwhelmed, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Somewhere in the world... someone you do not know will die.
F	NORMA	Those were his exact words.
M	ARTHUR	Did he say how they would die?
F	NORMA	No.
M	ARTHUR	And he showed you the cash.
F	NORMA	Yeah. He said it was two-hundred thousand. It looked real to me.
M	ARTHUR	What did he look like?
F	NORMA	You don't want to know. I think he's a burn victim. Poor thing... half of his face is gone.
M	ARTHUR	Really?
F	NORMA	I think maybe he's a life insurance salesman. Maybe that's what it is. It's some kind of survey. We push the button and he offers us a discount on a two-hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joke's on us.
M	ARTHUR	Did you bring the key with you? She hands it to him. He takes the key and inserts it... opening the glass dome.
F	NORMA	What the hell are you doing?! I was gonna push the button.
F	NORMA	No! Norma reaches over and snaps the dome closed.
M	ARTHUR	You think it's for real. She takes the box back from him.
F	NORMA	I don't know. He was... he seemed very sure of himself. If it's some kind of survey... then... he's a really good salesman because I believe him. I believe that he might give us that money.
M	ARTHUR	Do then you think he's a maniac and he might go kill someone?
F	NORMA	I don't know. Arthur takes the box back from her. He shakes it... then
M	ARTHUR	Open the glove compartment. There's a philips head screwdriver in there. She opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT and retrieves a PHILLIPS HEAD
F	NORMA	What are you doing? Arthur is now unscrewing the bottom of the box.
M	ARTHUR	I'm gonna see what's inside of it. He removes the screw... and sees that the wooden base rotates
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Nothing... no transmitter... no radio. If we pushed the button right now... he'd have no way of knowing. She takes the box from him and closes the dome.
M	ARTHUR	Let me hold the key.
F	NORMA	Why do you get to hold it?
M	ARTHUR	Because you'll lose it Norma. You can't hold your liquor.
F	NORMA	Neither can you.
M	ARTHUR	What if someone takes your purse? I have pockets. Let me hold it.
F	NORMA	Fine. Norma goes through her purse and hands the small envelope to
F	NORMA	Jesus. All this for a rehearsal dinner... Deborah is so lucky. Remember our rehearsal dinner?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah. Keg party in our back yard. Susan and Jim are standing with ARTHUR LEWIS, SR (50s) and
F	DANA	Merry Christmas... Walter takes the package and begins to remove the wrapping Inside is a COMIC BOOK. He pulls it out of the wrapping... The title is: THE MAN FROM MARS Walter looks at the cover in awe.
M	WALTER	Thanks Dana. My dad is gonna love this.
M	BEV	When are you gonna cut this hair?
M	ARTHUR	Never. Are you still cutting his hair?
F	NORMA	Uh-huh.
M	ARTHUR SR.	Are you Leonard or Skynard?
M	BEV	Well honey... they're never gonna let you into outer space with these sideburns.
M	SUSAN	They're all wearing them that way now, Bev. NATHAN BURNS ( 26), Norma's wheelchair-bound younger brother,
M	NATHAN	Outer space? Is someone planning on departing the surface of the earth?
M	ARTHUR	Nathan! Arthur stands up and gives him a hug. It's been years. How have you been?
M	NATHAN	I've been better... I mean, I used to have legs... The table goes silent... Susan looks as though she might Sorry... morbid humor. What's this talk about outer space?
F	NORMA	Arthur has been working at Nasa.
M	JIM	He helped design the camera that photographed the Mars surface. Arthur puts his hands on the back of Nathan's wheelchair.
M	ARTHUR	Nathan and I are gonna go grab a drink... He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar.
F	NORMA	Arthur made me a new prosthesis for my foot. Some space age formula... it's incredible.
M	JIM	Can he make Nathan a pair of prosthetic legs?
M	NATHAN	Can you believe it? I survive eighteen months crawlling through the Vietnam jungle and not one bullet so much as grazes my body. And I come home, take a few tabs of LSD at a Grateful Dead show and wrap my car around a tree. Arthur doesn't know how to respond.
M	NATHAN (CONT'D)	Pretty damn sad... losing the legs that way, but I always thought it was Karmic retribution for what I did to Norma.
M	ARTHUR	What'd you ever do to Norma?
M	NATHAN	I dropped that barbell on her foot when we were kids. That's why she went to get that x-ray. If it wasn't for me... she'd still have all her toes.
M	ARTHUR	You can't think of it that way.
M	NATHAN	Why not? It's the truth.
M	ARTHUR	You didn't leave the x-ray machine on, Dr. Stupid did.
M	NATHAN	Yeah, but my mistake sent her to Dr. Stupid... so that makes me culpable in the eyes of Buddha.
M	ARTHUR	You're no more culpable than the company that manufactured the barbell. Stop punishing yourself. Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack
M	NATHAN	You know he's here.
M	ARTHUR	Who?
M	NATHAN	Dr. Stupid. Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE
M	NATHAN (CONT'D)	Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a practice over on the west end. Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye
M	SUSAN	I wonder if he even recognizes us.
M	JIM	I'm sure he does.
F	DEBORAH	I can't believe they still let him practice medicine.
F	NORMA	You gotta let it go. You gotta learn to forgive and forget.
M	SUSAN	I'd be willing to forgive him if he would've just admitted his negligence under oath. The bastard lied... said it was the x-ray machine that malfunctioned. SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL (50s) and his son EDWARD POWELL
M	SUSAN (CONT'D)	Well Senator! You look very spiffy tonight!
M	POWELL	Now that the mid-term elections are over... the smile lines are starting to fade. Powell puts on a fake smile, grabs Jim's hand and they both
M	SUSAN	Well... we all voted! Powell looks over at Norma.
M	POWELL	Norma... right?
F	NORMA	That's right. He shakes her hand... fascinated by her.
M	POWELL	And you're married to the aspiring astronaut.
F	NORMA	That's right. There he is right over there. She points over to Arthur the bar. Powell looks over at
F	DANA	Walter?
M	WALTER	Yeah?
F	DANA	Will you take me down to the basement? I want to see your dad's darkroom.
F	DANA	Is that Mars?
M	WALTER	Yep.
F	DANA	What did your dad have to do with the Viking?
M	WALTER	He helped design the camera. Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	He's making the model for the science museum. Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	They designed the camera to photograph in 360 degrees. It scans in the image one line at a time... and takes about five minutes to complete one revolution.
F	DANA	How do they get the images back to earth?
M	WALTER	Radio transmission. They figured out a way to interpret the scan lines and then print them onto film.
F	DANA	How long does it take to transmit back to earth?
M	WALTER	About ten hours. Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	They tested the camera in the parking lot at Langley last year. Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	There's my dad. He moves his finger across the line of smiling faces...
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	And there he is again. Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	And there he is again. Dana looks close at the photo.
F	DANA	How'd he do that?
M	WALTER	Because the camera takes five minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he waited until the camera passed over him then jumped ahead in the circle. The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
F	DANA	Your dad sounds pretty clever.
M	WALTER	My dad is more than just clever, Dana. My dad is the coolest man who ever walked the face of the earth. The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down
F	NORMA	Two-hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	What would we do with that kind of money?
F	NORMA	We could get out of Richmond... move to California.
M	ARTHUR	Then we could cross the border into Mexico if they ever came after us.
F	NORMA	You can't arrest someone for pushing a button, Arthur. It's not a weapon. It's not a gun. We wouldn't be culpable... not in a court of law.
M	ARTHUR	What if it's someone's baby?
F	NORMA	What if it's some murderer on death row in China?
M	ARTHUR	What if it's our neighbor across the street. Do you know our neighbors across the street? Have you ever met them?
F	NORMA	Yeah. Doug and Donna.
M	ARTHUR	Hmmm. I haven't met Doug or Donna. What does it mean to officially know someone, anyway? Do you know me, Norma?
F	NORMA	I know you better than you know yourself.
M	ARTHUR	Do you know Walter?
F	NORMA	Even better than I know you. They spin around on the dance floor.
M	ARTHUR	It's just a stupid prank, Norma.
F	NORMA	Life insurance. Arthur gazes across the ballroom toward the bar. Nathan sits
F	NORMA	Dana... Dana's eyes slowly open.
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	Arthur will drive you home, okay?
F	DANA	I have my bike... and my house isn't far from here.
F	NORMA	Where's Walter?
F	DANA	He's asleep upstairs. Arthur hands Dana a ten dollar bill.
M	ARTHUR	Are you sure you don't need a ride?
F	DANA	I'm sure.
M	ARTHUR	Good night, Dana. Dana exits through the front door. Norma stands up and moves
F	NORMA	Can you turn off the Christmas tree lights?
M	ARTHUR	I like leaving them on.
F	NORMA	It's a fire hazard.
M	ARTHUR	It keeps the Christmas spirit alive while we sleep.
F	NORMA	We could die.
M	ARTHUR	Everyone dies eventually, Norma. She stares at the tree.
F	NORMA	Fine. Leave them on. She goes upstairs... leaving him alone with the glowing tree. He then walks over to the wall and unplugs the Christmas tree Arthur rolls over and wraps his arm around her. INSERT: Various illustrations from the comic... a HUGE TEMPLE ::WT.

F	NORMA	We'll never see that much money.
M	ARTHUR	Why do you say that?
F	NORMA	Be realistic Arthur... you work for the government.
M	ARTHUR	Maybe not forever.
F	NORMA	We'll never leave Richmond.
M	ARTHUR	Do you want to move?
F	NORMA	We have to put Walter in public school.
M	ARTHUR	Why?
F	NORMA	Collegiate withdrew the faculty tuition discount.
M	ARTHUR	No...
F	NORMA	Yeah. They did. Even if we sold my car and moved into a smaller house, we couldn't afford that school.
M	ARTHUR	No...
F	NORMA	We'd have to enroll him at Hopewell. Unless...
M	ARTHUR	Unless what, Norma? She reaches out and holds her finger over the button...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Are you gonna call him?
F	NORMA	Yeah. Norma begins to dial the number on the card. Arlington sits on the bed... staring silently at the wall. He
M	ARLINGTON	Hello Mrs. Lewis.
F	NORMA	Is this Mr. Steward?
M	ARLINGTON (PHONE)	Of course it is.
F	NORMA	How did you know it was me... are you tracing this call?
M	ARLINGTON (PHONE)	Time is running out... have you made your decision? Norma looks to Arthur... who paces around the kitchen.
F	NORMA	If we push the button... are you going to murder someone?
M	ARLINGTON	When you push the button... somewhere in this world... someone you do not know... will die. I never mentioned the word murder. How will they die?
M	ARLINGTON	I'm not at liberty to disclose that information. Besides... it would spoil the fun.
M	NORMA (PHONE)	Are you selling life insurance?
M	ARLINGTON	I am not at liberty to disclose any information about my employers. I can only remind you that the offer is real... .and it expires in approximately eight hours. Why do you do this? What do you get out of this deal?
M	ARLINGTON	Absolutely nothing. The reward is for you.
M	ARLINGTON (PHONE)	Is there anything else, Mrs. Lewis? I have an appointment to make and I don't want to be late.
F	NORMA	Can we meet in person? I'd like to see you... before we make our final decision.
M	ARLINGTON	Why... I'm looking at you right now, Norma.
F	NORMA	Excuse me?
M	ARLINGTON	The grey spotted owl... in your back yard. Norma turns and looks out the large picture window in the The large bird sits motionless... its large SAUCER EYES do Norma stares at it for a long moment... transfixed. Arthur
F	NORMA	Hello? There is no response.
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	Mr. Steward? Are you still there? Norma hangs up the phone. She stares at the box... then at
M	ARTHUR	What do you want to do Norma?
F	NORMA	We're gonna have to pull Walter out of that school.
M	ARTHUR	Then push it. Push the button, Norma... push the button. I dare you. I double-dog diddly dare you.
F	NORMA	I'm scared to.
M	ARTHUR	Well... if you don't push it... then I will. This is stupid. Arthur reaches out to push the button... but she grabs his
F	NORMA	Ladies first. She then reaches out and presses down on the button with her 911 emergency... how may I direct your call? The CAMERA moves in closer... Excuse me? You need to slow down... I can't understand what you're saying. She listens to the voice on the other end of the line.
M	OPERATOR #1 (CONT'D)	So you heard loud screaming and then a gun shot. What is your address? 1500 Cary Street. I heard a gunshot... then he ran out the front door and got in his car. The POLICE OFFICER looks at his partner and then proceeds to The CAMERA moves in toward her face. Honey... I need you to back away from the door... I'M GONNA HAVE TO
M	KICK IT DOWN?	The screaming begins to subside.
M	FEMALE VOICE	okay... The Officer then kicks the door down.
M	ARTHUR	There's no turning back now. Seconds later... THE DOORBELL RINGS. Both Norma and Arthur jump in their seats. She opens the door. Arlington stands there smiling...
M	ARLINGTON	Hello, Mrs. Lewis.
F	NORMA	Hi.
M	ARLINGTON	Do you have the button unit?
F	NORMA	Uhh... yeah... it's in the kitchen. Norma goes to the kitchen to retrieve the box, leaving Arthur
M	ARLINGTON	And you must be Mr. Lewis. Arthur stares at him... transfixed. Does he recognize him Norma returns with the box and hands it over to him.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	And the key?
F	NORMA	Oh... sorry... Norma reaches into her pocket and retrieves the small
M	ARLINGTON	Thank you. Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Two-hundred thousand. You can count it if you like. Arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes.
M	ARTHUR	Thanks... we trust your word. Arlington offers him a broad smile.
M	ARLINGTON	As you should. He then turns to leave.
F	NORMA	You said before that the box is re- programmed...
M	ARLINGTON	Yes.
F	NORMA	So now what? Are you gonna go and make the offer to someone else?
M	ARLINGTON	Why yes. That-'s how it works, Mrs. Lewis. And I can promise you that the offer will be made... to someone you do not know. He smiles... opens the door... and steps into the passenger
M	ARTHUR	I got his license plate.
M	ARTHUR	What are you thinking, Norma?
F	NORMA	I don't know. Arthur paces around... thinking. He then opens the briefcase
M	ARTHUR	Did he mean that we're next? Is that what he meant?
F	NORMA	I don't know.
M	SECRETARY	Your daughter is on line two.
M	JIM	Alright. He picks up the phone. Norma...
F	NORMA	What's going on...
F	NORMA	I need a favor. Sure... what do you need?
F	NORMA	I need you to run a license plate for me. Someone just came by the house... and we think he might... He just seemed real suspicious and Arthur got the license plate and I need you to run it. Okay honey... you need me to send someone over?
F	NORMA	No... if you could just run the plate and find out whose car it is. AXV-4049 is the number.
M	JIM (PHONE)	I'll call you back in ten minutes.
M	OFFICER #2	We ran those plates for you, sarge. Jim takes the document from him. It is a blow-up of a
F	NORMA	Hello? The car is listed to an Arlington J. Steward... do you want his address and phone number?
F	NORMA	Yeah. Norma begins to write them down.
M	FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)	Hello?
F	NORMA	Hi... I'm trying to reach an Arlington Steward. Mrs. Lewis, I presume? Norma's eyes widen. She nods to Arthur and points to the
F	NORMA	Yes.
M	FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)	I assume that you pushed the button.
F	NORMA	Yes.
M	FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)	There is the myth of Prometheus and Pandora... Prometheus gave Pandora a box... and warned her not to open it. But she did not listen, and when Pandora opened the box... she unleashed a torrent of sorrow and misery. Norma stares at Arthur... unable to speak.
M	FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D)	Your descent into oblivion has begun. The question remains... what will the cuckold of a husband do... to prevent the death of his beloved Pandora? Arthur stares at Norma... unable to speak.
M	FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D)	Because really... Mr. Lewis... do you really know your wife?
M	ARTHUR	Who is this?
M	FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)	I am the mother of Prometheus... and if you want to save yourself... I suggest that you go to the Richmond Public Library, and find the book with the following call number: F2988.34 Norma is writing the number out on a piece of paper.
M	ARTHUR	Norma...
F	NORMA	Arthur...
M	ARTHUR	Tell me this isn't real. Tell me this isn't happening.
F	NORMA	This isn't real. This isn't happening.
M	ARTHUR	I don't think I believe you, Norma.
F	NORMA	We're off to run an errand. Be back in a few hours, okay?
M	WALTER	Okay. He watches as they drive off.
F	NORMA	There was owl... in our back yard.
M	ARTHUR	An owl?
F	NORMA	He said it was his owl.
M	ARTHUR	Are you hiding anything else from me, Norma? No. Norma removes a BOOK from the shelf and looks at the cover: Norma shows it to Arthur.
F	NORMA	No exit. Sartre.
F	NORMA	it's pronounced Sartre. Jean-Paul Sartre. The French existentialist. She begins to thumb through the pages of the play.
M	ARTHUR	Never read it.
F	NORMA	It's a play... I read it in high school. It's about three strangers who find themselves trapped in a room together for all of eternity. They've quickly discover that they've all been sent to hell. Norma turns back to the inside cover of the book. Norma runs her hand down the list of names on the library
F	NORMA	Hi... we're looking for an archival Times-Dispatch from September of this year. She offers them a warm smile.
M	LIBRARIAN	Microfiche.
M	ARTHUR	Arlington Steward... I remember the name now. He used to work at Everyone is assembled... staring at a large BLANK SCREEN,
M	CAHILL	Alright... the first photo should come down off the server in less than a minute. Standing on the trestle several yards away from the antennae So place your bet... martians or no martians? The SCIENTISTS erupt in loud cheering and applause.
M	BEVILACQUA	Touchdown. An engineer at the NASA Langley research center was struck by lightning yesterday evening... He hears the cheering from the walkie-talkie. Thunder rumbles Moments later... a MASSIVE LIGHTNING BOLT STRIKES THE TOP
M	BEVILACQUA	Jesus Christ. Bevilacqua and the others begin to sprint across the lawn
M	ARTHUR	The man received third degree burns over fifty percent of his body...
M	ARTHUR	He got struck by lightning on the night we received the transmission from Mars. Cahill emerges from inside the building and rushes out to the
M	CAHILL	What happened?
M	BEVILACQUA	The module got hit!
M	CAHILL	Lightning?
M	BEVILACQUA	Yeah. Steward was up there on the trestle. He got burned real bad! The CAMERA moves in toward Bevilacqua's face... his eyes
M	JIM	Our fugitive is named Robert Bevilacqua. He shot and killed his wife at their residence on Cary Street earlier today. We believe that he escaped on foot... and could be armed and dangerous. The CAMERA moves across a line of POLICE OFFICERS... Mr. Bevilacqua is an employee at NASA... and he is a former Marine who served in Vietnam. He may very well be armed and dangerous...
M	WENDELL	Bevilacqua... Bevilacqua turns to face him.
M	BEVILACQUA	Wendell. They hug one another.
M	BEVILACQUA	You designed it?
M	WENDELL	Yeah. Cahill told me to... Bevilacaua notices a SMALL PURPLE STAIN on the blue-print.
M	WENDELL	This what you were looking for, sir? Cahill looks stares at the blue-print... possessed. A DROP OF
M	CAHILL	Yes. Thank you Wendell. Cahill stands at a work table with Arlington. There are THREE Cahill then hands Arlington a FILE.
M	CAHILL	You're not gonna hurt these boys, are you?
M	ARLINGTON	Any harm that comes to them will be their own doing. Arlington takes the bag and moves toward the hangar entrance. Wendell watches them drive off...
M	WENDELL	There's a list... and they've all got a wife and one child. Bevilacqua thumbs through the list of NASA dossiers. He sees
M	WENDELL (CONT'D)	Did you kill your wife? Bevilacqua just stares at him... on the verge of tears. He
M	BEVILACQUA	This is a confession letter that I wrote... it explains everything that happened with Steward and the box. Keep it... cause if I don't make it... this might clear my name one day. Bevilacqua looks at the KENNETH WELLER dossier.
M	BEVILACQUA (CONT'D)	This guy Weller is gonna be next. Did you get their phone number?
M	WENDELL	No. They're not listed. Just an old address south of Petersburg. What are you gonna do?
M	BEVILACQUA	I don't know. I need a car. I might be able to save them... and this guy Arthur Lewis... Wendell thinks to himself... then retrieves a set of KEYS
M	WENDELL	These are the keys to my cousin's pick-up truck. It's not registered. It's parked in front of my house over on Byrd street. Take it...
M	BEVILACQUA	Thank you, Wendell. Steward. First name Arlington... middle name is James. He begins to scrawl words down on a piece of paper: Just then... his RECEPTIONIST opens the door to his office.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Sir... there's a Mr. Steward here to see you. Thank you... that's all I need. He hangs up the phone and looks through the glass window of Standing there through the glass... is a man who looks He stands with the normal side of his face in profile. He
M	JIM (CONT'D)	Send him in. He stands in profile... then turns toward the CAMERA in the
M	STEWARD TWIN	Officer Burns... my name is Reston Steward.
M	ARLINGTON	Officer Burns... my name is Reston Steward.
M	RESTON	I see you have made an inquiry about my brother Arlington.
M	ARLINGTON	. an inquiry about my brother Arlington.
M	JIM	Yes. Apparently he made an appearance at my daughter's house. Your brother works for NASA?
M	ARLINGTON	Yes. My brother works at the Langley research facility.
M	JIM	With my son-in-law.
M	RESTON	That's right.
M	JIM	And may I ask... what do you do, Mr. Steward?
M	RESTON	I work for the CIA.
M	JIM	I see. He then hands Jim one of his cards. Jim looks at it.
M	RESTON STEWARD	Reston rises to his feet... putting his hat on his head.
M	RESTON	I assure you my brother is of no threat to your daughter. However, the man you're looking for... Robert Bevilacqua. He is very dangerous... and he might try and contact your son-in-law or your daughter.
M	JIM	Really.
M	RESTON	Yes.
M	RESTON (CONT'D)	Help us find Bevilacqua. If and when you do... please call us. Jim stares at the business card as Reston bids him good-bye.
M	RESTON	General Nathan Teague at the Pentagon. Get him on the phone immediately. The Agent opens the car door, and Reston steps inside.
M	ARTHUR	You alright, Norma?
F	NORMA	I feel like I'm gonna faint... She stands up to leave.
M	ARTHUR	Where are you going?
F	NORMA	Bathroom. Norma moves.taward the main library... leaving Arthur alone. A shadow passes across the wall... and Arthur senses someone
M	LIBRARIAN	The myth of Prometheus tells the story of a God who created man. When Prometheus flew too close to the sun... his wings caught fire... and he fell to the earth. Arthur remembers her voice from the phone call.
M	ARTHUR	Was that you on the phone? You're his mother...
M	LIBRARIAN	He finds your wife fascinating... Mr. Lewis. Her name is ELIZABETH STEWARD.
M	ARLINGTON	Have a seat... Mrs. Lewis. She looks around... realizing that the library is now
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Don't be afraid. I may look like a monster... but-I can assure you that I am... only human. His face contorts into a broad smile.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Please... sit down.
M	ELIZABETH	My name is Clymene, mother of five. Prometheus, Atlas, Menoetius, Logan, and Epimetheus. A drop of blood begins to ooze from her left eye as she
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Epimetheus is the twin brother of Prometheus, but he has become his brother's slave... the victim of his cunning and deceit.
M	ARLINGTON	Tell me Norma... when was the exact moment that you realized you loved your husband? There is something about him that now makes her feel safe...
F	NORMA	About five seconds after I laid eyes on him.
M	ARLINGTON	And when was this?
F	NORMA	In college. My sophomore year. He was a year younger than me. We dated for two weeks and then... She stops herself.
M	ARLINGTON	You became frightened about something.
F	NORMA	Then I thought... this is too good to be true. When he sees my mangled foot... he's gonna be out the door in ten seconds and he's gonna go tell all his friends.
M	ARLINGTON	How did he respond when you showed him?
F	NORMA	We were at the drive-in... and he caught a glimpse of the scars on my thigh. He asked me what happened... and I felt this sense of dread.
M	ARLINGTON	Why?
F	NORMA	Because you can just see the glow disappear in someone's eyes when they discover something about you that they just can't stomach.
M	ARLINGTON	Did the glow disappear from his eyes?
F	NORMA	No. Not Arthur. He was different than the others. He... said that... my scars were cool. He said that they made me more attractive.
M	ELIZABETH	I have worked at this library for forty years. Since 1936, I have read a book a day. 23455 books I have read.
M	ARTHUR	Wow. Someone should nominate you for librarian of the year. She holds the copy of No Exit in her hands.
M	ELIZABETH	Of all of the books I have read in my lifetime... this is my son's favorite. Have you ever read No Exit?
M	ARTHUR	No. She reaches out with her hand.
M	ELIZABETH	Take my hand... and I'll show you. He stares at the blood coagulating in the bag beneath her
M	ARTHUR	I'm not gonna touch you, lady.
M	ARLINGTON	And what emotion did you feel when you first laid eyes upon me, Norma? She thinks silently for a moment.
F	NORMA	I felt.. . She stops herself... afraid of how he might respond if she is
M	ARLINGTON	You felt what?
F	NORMA	I felt...
M	ARLINGTON	Pity?
F	NORMA	Love.
M	ARLINGTON	You felt love for me?
F	NORMA	Yes.
M	ARLINGTON	Why?
F	NORMA	Because of my foot. Because of my disfigurement. I thought of all the pain I've felt in my life because of it... the physical pain... the emotional pain. I thought about what it would be like to have that pain magnified and projected onto my face... onto a part of my body that I can't hide with a shoe. There are tears welling in her eyes.
M	NORMA (CONT`D)	I saw all of that pain in your face and I understood it... and I felt an overwhelming feeling of love for you because I knew I'd never feel sorry for myself or my goddamn foot ever again.
M	ELIZABETH	Take my hand, son.
M	ARTHUR	You called me a cuckold. You made a statement... made an implication to me that my wife was going to be killed. So please understand why I might be reluctant to take your hand.
M	ARLINGTON	Take my hand, Norma... She stares at him, unable to move... then takes his hand... Arlington stands at the end of the corridor. He is wearing a Arlington opens a DOOR at the end of the corridor and leads Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS The CAMERA then drifts up and moves through the GLASS PANELS
M	ARTHUR	Norma... Her eyes open. She looks around... disoriented. Norma... what happened?
F	NORMA	I don't know. Norma notices Walter standing in the doorway.
M	WALTER	You came home an hour ago.
F	NORMA	We did? She sits up in bed... looking at the clock radio. It is 6PM.
M	WALTER	Neither of you said a word... you just walked into the house like two zombies. Went straight to bed. Arthur and Norma stare at one another, trying to make sense
F	NORMA	The wedding. It starts in an hour. We've got to get ready. Norma sees that the copy of No Exit is now sitting on --heir In his lap is a file. He is thumbing through a series of
M	WALTER	What's going on?
M	ARTHUR	I don't know.
M	WALTER	This is about the box... isn't it?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah.
M	WALTER	Did you push the button?
M	ARTHUR	Your mother did.
M	WALTER	What happens when you push the button?
M	ARTHUR	I don't know.
M	WALTER	Yes you do. You're just not telling me. Arthur finishes with his tie. He notices something on the
M	ARTHUR	Where did you get this?
M	WALTER	Dana. She gave it to me. Arthur begins to page through the comic book. STROBES OF WHITE LIGHT begin flicker from beneath the Arlington slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave.
M	SNIPER	Alright... they are entering the building from the south entrance on fourteenth street. Arlington nods back. Below it is a name:
M	RECEPTIONIST	Excuse me... may I help you?
M	ARLINGTON	Where is he?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Uhhh... he's in a meeting.
M	ARLINGTON	I need to see him... now.
M	RECEPTIONIST	He's here... I don't know what to do. Powell turns to face her.
M	POWELL	Let him in. The Receptionist goes back out... and within moments...
M	ARLINGTON	Hello Senator. Mr. Steward... it's good to see you.
M	ARLINGTON	Call me Arlington.
M	POWELL	Okay... Arlington. Bud just stares at the Senator... showing no sign of emotion.
M	ARLINGTON	Do you have my money?
M	POWELL	I've given you four-hundred thousand already. How much more are you going to need?
M	ARLINGTON	As much as it takes. Powell sighs out loud... irritated.
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	First the nose... Powell turns around and there is now BLOOD GUSHING from his Then the ears... BLOOD begins to ooze from both ears... as he covers his
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Then the eyes... Blood rushes from beneath his eyelids... his entire face
M	POWELL	Please! I've got it right here! Powell reaches beneath his desk and retrieves a large
M	POWELL (CONT'D)	It's all there! Two-hundred thousand! You can count it if you want!
M	ARLINGTON	Bud... Bud grabs the briefcase from the desk and pops it open. He
M	ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	You tell that sniper you have perched on that roof next door that I can smell his cheap cologne.
M	ARLINGTON (EARPIECE)	I think it might be Old Spice. The Sniper smells his shoulder. Norma clutches the copy of No Exit.
M	ARTHUR	You and Walter were there in the room. You were wearing a black dress, identical to the one you have on now. Walter had a blindfold on. And then your eyes...
F	NORMA	They didn't have lids...
M	ARTHUR	Yeah.
F	NORMA	I had the same dream. Arthur's mind is racing... he glances through the crowd
M	ARTHUR	What's the last thing you remember?
F	NORMA	The library. He was asking me all of these questions... about you... about our marriage. Then I took his hand... Susan approaches...
M	SUSAN	Alright girls... time to line up! Susan hands Arthur the book and goes off with the other
M	PREACHER	Do you, Deborah Burns, take Edward Powell, to be your'-lawfully wedded husband, 'til death do you part?
F	DEBORAH	I do. Norma looks over to Arthur, as he sits in the congregation. The CAMERA zooms into a close-up of the page describing the ESTELLE: [with a peal of laughter]: Forever. My God, how GARCIN: [looks over at the two women, and joins in the

M	ARTHUR	The play tells the story of uhree people, condemned to hell. They are to remain in a second empire drawing room for all of eternity. He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	They soon discover that their eyelids are missing... and for all eternity they will be unable to sleep. Norma remembers most of the play from high school.
F	NORMA	There are no mirrors... so they will never be able to see their own reflection... but only the faces of their tormentors.
M	ARTHUR	This is Sartre's vision of hell.
F	NORMA	Because Hell... is other people. The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass
M	JIM	Arthur... can I speak with you privately for a moment?
M	ARTHUR	Sure. Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that
M	JIM	And do you know this fella? Robert Bevilacqua?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah... I know him. He works at
M	JIM	Do you know his wife?
M	ARTHUR	No...
M	JIM	Well... he shot and killed his wife yesterday morning.
M	ARTHUR	No...
M	JIM	Yeah... He shot her point blank in the chest in his kitchen. Arthur takes a deep breath. He isn't feeling well.
M	JIM (CONT'D)	This Bevilacqua fella... if he tries to contact you or Norma... you have to call me immediately, you understand?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah. Of course. Arthur looks down at the lawn. Norma is staring back at them.
F	NORMA	My little sister once asked me... what's the best thing about being married? Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is I told her that... it's knowing that for the rest of your life you'll never feel alone. Not ever again. She smiles at her husband.
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	That is... until you get divorced. There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	Or... until he decides to kill you. More laughter.
M	ARTHUR	Why did you say that?
F	NORMA	Say what?
M	ARTHUR	In your speech. That joke about me killing you.
F	NORMA	I don't know... I thought it was funny. Guess I've had too much champagne.
M	ARTHUR	Did your dad tell you about Robert Bevilacqua?
F	NORMA	No.
M	ARTHUR	He shot his wife yesterday morning. Did you know his wife?
F	NORMA	No. Norma is still searching for some other explanation.
M	NORMA (CONT'D)	What if it's all a test for the aspiring astronauts?
M	ARTHUR	What do you mean?
F	NORMA	A psychological test. They want to see how you'll respond to a moral dilemma... the fate of a human life... determined by the push of a single button. Think of the men on the Apollo thirteen mission... sound familiar? They turn slowly on the dance floor...
M	VOICE (O.S.)	May I cut in? Arthur and Norma turn to see a MAN standing there...
M	STUPE	I would like to dance with your wife. Do you mind? Arthur glares at Dr. Stupe.
F	NORMA	It's okay Arthur... Arthur looks at him... then back at Norma. His face has gone Will you please excuse me? Arthur moves toward the stairs that lead up to the palatial
M	WALTER	Dad! What's going on?
M	ARTHUR	I.. I'm gonna be sick Walter... He places his hand on his son's head for a brief moment and ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma is now slow dancing with Dr.
M	STUPE	I know what they call me. Dr. Stupid. My patients... the ones who will still see me... they find out what I did and they stop calling.
F	NORMA	I'm sorry for that. I can't control what people say.
M	STUPE	I am Dr. Stupid now. Someone wrote it on my windshield with soap once. I figure it must have been a relative... a friend of yours. Oh... how they love you, Norma Lewis. And they love your husband... the one who saved you. Did he save your life? Did he rescue you from the oblivion that I manufactured?
F	NORMA	Yes. You have my forgiveness, Earl. People make mistakes... and if they seek forgiveness... they should be forgiven. That's the rule of my lord.
M	STUPE	There is that old cliche... that the lord works in mysterious ways. Well... I have met the lord. I have spoken to him in my dreams. And it brought me back to that day in my office when you arrived with a fractured foot... some thirteen years ago. He told me that it was essential...
M	STUPE (CONT'D)	an essential event in the cycle of purgatory and its inevitable conclusion. Norma pulls away from him. Blood drains out of his nose...
M	STUPE (CONT'D)	For when the cycle of purgatory concludes... there is nothing left but a barren wasteland of rock and sand... a deafening wind and a cold, dry winter. ABOVE... on the MARBLE RAILING... the OWL is perched on the ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Stupe retrieves a PISTOL from his I am sorry my dear... Stupe takes the pistol... places it against his temple... and BLOOD SPRAYS across the dance floor... some of it on Norma's
M	BEVILACQUA	You can still save yourself. It's too late for me... but you can still save yourself.
M	ARTHUR	Bevilacqua...
M	BEVILACQUA	Follow me out through the kitchen. I have a truck waiting... He looks toward the square... and begins to move in that The CAMERA drifts back toward the ROCK PILLAR that stands at Walter's face is ghost white with terror. He begins to walk
F	NORMA	Walter? Jim stands across the lawn, manning the chaos. He recognizes
M	JIM	I just spotted Bevilacqua... he's in a white pick-up truck. Potential hostage situation.
F	DANA	Walter...
M	WALTER	Hey. Bud arrives next to her.
F	DANA	Is everything alright?
M	WALTER	No.
F	DANA	Come with us. She takes his hand and they move north back toward the Did you push the button... or was it your wife?
M	ARTHUR	My wife. Yeah... me too. I wasn't even home. She decided to push it when I wasn't around to stop her.
M	ARTHUR	And now she's dead. Did you kill her?
M	BEVILACQUA	I don't want to talk about it.
M	ARTHUR	Where are you taking me? Bevilacqua retrieves a NASA DOSSIER from the dashboard and
M	BEVILACQUA	Kenneth Weller. You know him?
M	ARTHUR	Name sounds familiar. Does he work at Langley too?
M	BEVILACQUA	Yep. He's next. Him and his wife... they've got the box now. Suddenly... BLUE AND RED LIGHTS appear behind them...
M	ARTHUR	What are you doing?
M	BEVILACQUA	I'm not gonna let them get me... Arthur... we've got to get to Kenneth Weller. We've got to break the chain... or your wife is gonna die!
M	ARTHUR	How is she going to die?
M	BEVILACQUA	You're going to kill her! Bevilacqua swerves into the ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE to pass a Bevilacqua pulls the truck back into the right lane.
M	ARTHUR	Jesus! You're gonna get us killed!
M	BEVILACQUA	Did Steward take you to the library? Did you meet his mother... the librarian?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah.
M	BEVILACQUA	Did she tell you about Prometheus?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah...
M	BEVILACQUA	Steward has a twin brother... and he works for the CIA. UP AHEAD... Arthur sees FOUR MORE POLICE CRUISERS with their This is purgatory... we're living in purgatory... A BULLET explodes the right front tire...
F	NORMA	Walter? A BLACK SEDAN pulls up next to her... and Reston steps out of Norma locks eyes with him... recognizing his face...
M	RESTON	Mrs. Lewis? Norma Lewis?
F	NORMA	Yes.
M	RESTON	My name is Reston Steward. I work for the CIA.
F	NORMA	Yeah? Where is my son? Where is my husband?
M	RESTON	Please... get into the car. Norma stares at him in disbelief... as he opens the back door Please... there isn't much time. Robert Bevilacqua's DEAD BODY is now on a stretcher. Jim
M	JIM	Where's Arthur?
M	OFFICER #1	They took him away in an ambulance.
M	EMS TECHNICIAN	Here... hold this against your forehead. It'll keep your head from swelling. Arthur takes the ice pack and places it against his head.
M	ARTHUR	Thanks.
M	EMS TECHNICIAN	I think it might have been a miracle. The EMS Technician shakes his head in disbelief.
M	ARTHUR	What?
M	EMS TECHNICIAN	That car accident. I've never seen someone walk away from an accident like that. Somebody upstairs is looking out for you, buddy. The door to the ambulance opens. A US ARMY OFFICER appears.
M	TEAGUE	Are you able to walk, son?
M	ARTHUR	Yes, sir.
M	TEAGUE	Please step out of the ambulance. There are more than a dozen POLICE CARS parked in front, Arthur notices Norma as she emerges from a BLACK SEDAN... she
F	NORMA	Arthur!
M	ARTHUR	Norma! She hugs him... neither has slept in two days.
F	NORMA	Where's Walter?
M	ARTHUR	I don't know. Reston steps forward.
M	RESTON	My brother has taken your son... but he assures me that he is alive and well. Reston tries to comfort them with a smile.
M	RESTON (CONT'D)	Take a walk with us. Norma and Arthur begin to walk with Reston, Teague and Cahill
M	RESTON (CONT'D)	Are you familiar with the myth of Prometheus?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah.
M	RESTON	In the 1940s... when NASA was formed, we began developing, in secret, a project that we dubbed the Prometheus Effect.
M	TEAGUE	Projecting fictional scenarios about how we would respond, if and when we came into contact with an alien intelligence.
M	RESTON	If the intelligence had hostile intent... or if it began to somehow display proof of its ability to destroy us, we would have a system in place to begin negotiating with it in secret.
M	TEAGUE	The goal of Prometheus is to maintain coexistence with this life- form, and eventually achieve peace with it, so that its power can be harnessed, developed and applied in such a manner that will benefit the human race. Arthur notices that Cahill is holding a folder in his right
M	CAHILL	On the night of September 3rd, as the server was downloading images from the Viking camera system that you helped design... we experienced an electrical surge from a bolt of lightning. As they arrive at the entrance to the diner, Cahill shows
M	CAHILL (CONT'D)	An anomaly in the series of Viking images produced this photograph of the Mars surface. The photo appears to be a ghost-like TRAIL OF WHITE LIGHT Teague nods toward the diner window.
M	TEAGUE	According to... it... and whatever it is... Arthur notices Arlington sitting alone in a booth inside the A ghost... an apparition... a methane compound imbedded in pulse of electricity...
M	CAHILL	If the human spirit is assigned a specific bandwidth upon conception... twins... would provide it with a dual bandwidth carrier... It claims to be more than six billion years old.
M	J	Arthur stares at the streak of white light in the photo.
M	ARTHUR	My camera... took this photo...
M	CAHILL	We've run the data sequence off the server more than a thousand times. Each time... this one photo in the sequence comes out of the dark room just like this. We can't explain why. Arthur hands the photo back to Cahill.
F	NORMA	What does it want? Cahill glances at Teague... who looks to Cahill.
M	CAHILL	I think the same thing that it wanted from Bevilacqua... except that poor boy is no longer around to tell us why he shot his wife.
F	NORMA	were in the car with him?
M	ARTHUR	Something about breaking the chain. He wanted to find the next test subject... and prevent them from pushing the button. Cahill is writing diligently on his NOTE PAD. He closes his eyes... his body begins to twitch.
M	RESTON	General Teague... it's a pleasure to meet you. I would like to continue with my experiment... if you don't mind. Reston smiles at the General. Please do not interfere... as I assure you that if you do... there will be dire consequences... Reston then turns to face Arthur and Norma.
M	RESTON (CONT'D)	Time is of the essence... and I'd like to invite my guests inside. Reston opens the door to the diner and gestures to Arthur and Arlington sits alone in a booth. He pivots his head around to
M	ARLINGTON	Please have a seat. Reston sits down next to his twin brother... Arthur and Norma Arlington has now locked completely into his brother's The movement of the two men is in now in PERFECT Arlington's eyes remain closed in deep concentration...
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	Don't be frightened by my manner of communication... but it is becoming more difficult for me to speak, given my body's... condition.
F	NORMA	What have you done with our son?
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	We'll get to him in a moment... but first I want you to know that I have a deep respect and admiration you both, and I am very sorry... that you pushed the button. Bud then removes Walter's right shoe and sock... exposing his
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	I will now give you a chance to save yourselves... an opportunity for redemption and salvation. BLOOD from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	Two of your son's five functional senses have been permanently impaired.
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	He is now blind and deaf. For the rest of his life, he will never hear your voice... or see your face.
M	ARTHUR	Why...
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	You are now presented with two options. Option one... you enjoy the rest of your lives with the money you have been given, and you learn to live with your son's disability. Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL.
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	And then there is option number two. There is one bullet in the chamber of this gun. Reston slides the gun across the table in Arthur's direction.
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	You can fire this bullet into your wife's heart... killing her. At the exact moment that her spirit departs the earth, this curse upon your son will be reversed, and both of his impaired senses will instantaneously return to normal. Arthur looks over at Norma in disbelief... then back at the
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)	Arthur, you will then be arrested and charged with the murder of your wife... and the money will be placed in an interest bearing trust for your son to receive upon his eighteenth birthday.
F	NORMA	That's not fair. Let me do it. I, pushed your stupid button. If I deserve to be punished for it... then let me kill myself. Arthur has nothing to do with this.
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	I'm sorry, but the offer is not negotiable. And if Norma's fingers so much as touch the weapon at any point from this moment on... the restoration of Walter's sight and sound will be denied. If Arthur has to do it... then I want you to make it look like a suicide. Arthur shouldn't be punished for something that I did.
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	I'm sorry... but the terms of the offer are not negotiable. Arthur faces has gone completely white.
M	ARTHUR	Is there an afterlife? The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Because this is purgatory, right? The earth is purgatory... and you're here to start shutting things down... right? The twins appear impressed with his foresight.
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	I find your theory to be quite fascinating. But I must remind you that I am unable to disclose the identity of my employers. Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras.
M	ARTHUR	Right. I get it. Reston then turns to the window...
M	RESTON/ARLINGTON	Can someone please bring up the car? Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Tell me this isn't happening, Norma.
F	NORMA	This isn't happening... She starts the engine... and they drive off.
F	NORMA	All these years... I've given you the impression that Walter was an accident.
M	ARTHUR	Yeah... and?
F	NORMA	And... it wasn't exactly an accident. I stopped taking the pill when I met you...
M	ARTHUR	Why?
F	NORMA	Because I was so afraid of losing you to someone prettier than me. Arthur just stares at her... unsure how to respond. For that alone... I deserve a bullet in the heart... don't you think?
M	ARTHUR	No... I don't. She manages a smile. A tear rolls down her cheek as she They step out of the car. Dana is sitting on the front porch, She rises to her feet as they approach.
F	DANA	Did my dad tell you why he loves you, Norma? Norma realizes that she has been involved all along. Blood
F	NORMA	No.
F	DANA	Because you're an amputee. He says that the soul of an amputee leaks out into the wind... searching for the place where there is no longer flesh and bone. It says that the soul that leaks is the soul that endures. It is the kindest and bravest soul of them all.
F	NORMA	Where is our son?
F	DANA	He's locked in the upstairs bathroom. I think he just woke up. Dana turns away... and begins to walk down the sidewalk in His EYE-BALLS are now COMPLETELY WHITE... pupils no longer
M	WALTER	Is anyone-there?! He begins clawing at the walls... trying to figure out where
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	I can't see! He climbs out of the bathtub and begins to crawl across the He begins to bang on the door relentlessly. Norma tries to open the door but there is a MASSIVE LOCK
F	NORMA	Walter! Norma reaches down and takes her son's hand.
M	WALTER	Who's there?! Who's there?!
F	NORMA	Walter! It's mom! Can you hear me?! Thump... thump...
M	ARTHUR	We need to kick the door down.
F	NORMA	He could get hurt... Norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist... and
M	WALTER	Who's there? Who's there? Norma rises to her feet.
F	NORMA	Come downstairs, Arthur. She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in Arthur... I need you to come downstairs with me... right now. Suzanne has the box sitting on the mattress in front of
F	SUZANNE	I'm gonna push it.
M	ARTHUR	Norma...
F	NORMA	Arthur... I love you, and I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry that I did this to us...
M	ARTHUR	I'm the one who told you to push the button... so don't apologize. He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely I love you too... and please know... that I regret nothing in this life we've lived together.
F	NORMA	I'll be waiting... counting the days until my Arthur comes to see me. She then presses down.
F	NORMA	It's going to be harder for you to live than for me to die. Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is
M	ARTHUR	Well then. Let's get on with it. Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall BLOOD begins to flow from the exit wound in her back across
M	OPERATOR #1	911 emergency... how may I direct your call? The CAMERA moves in closer...
M	ARTHUR	Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560 Monument Avenue. I've just shot my wife... can you please send an ambulance? The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.
M	WALTER!!!	He pulls himself to his feet and heads into the foyer. Walter's hand comes sliding out from beneath the crack in the
M	WALTER	Dad?
M	ARTHUR	Yes... can you hear me?
M	WALTER	Yeah.
M	ARTHUR	What do you see? Where are you Walter?
M	WALTER	I'm in the bathroom...
M	ARTHUR	Can you see clearly?
M	WALTER	Yeah... I can see... everything is bright... but I can see.
M	ARTHUR	Everything is bright. Everything is bright Walter... you're gonna be okay, buddy.
M	WALTER	What's going on?
M	ARTHUR	You're gonna be okay, buddy. That's all that matters. That's all that matters, now. Out of the corner of his eye, Arthur notices something at the Arthur obeys... and the cop rushes over and pushes him over Suzanne Weller opens the door. Arlington is standing there
M	ARLINGTON	Mrs. Weller... do you have the button unit?
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry, Jim. He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine. Arthur reaches up with his hands... cuffed together... and I`m sorry... From the window... Walter watches the car pull away from the He places his hand on the glass... waving back.
