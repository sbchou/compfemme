M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ALICE	"By tomorrow, we will have flown to France." She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Who can give me an example? Paul? NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be
M	PAUL	"I will have completed the assigned translation by the end of vacation."
M	ALICE	C'est bon! Amber?
M	AMBER	I will have failed French again by the end of the year. Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.
M	ALICE	En francais si'l vows plait?
F	EMMA	So, the definition of the derivative of the function "f" at point "x" is..? Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 2. EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Okay! Kyle? KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.
M	KYLE	Um... I guess I'm a little lost. If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a
F	EMMA	Try to follow along. I really want you guys to get this! David? DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Cindy? They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.
F	MEG	Do me a favor, and let's just try to get to vacation. The class bell RINGS! You can burn the school down as soon as we're back.
M	RICHARD	Got practice until five thirty, then I'll be by.
M	ALICE	I'll see you then. Thanks. They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic
M	RICHARD	Hey, Meg! Bon voyage! Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.
M	ALICE	I finished our travel binders! Meg takes the binder, looks it over.
F	MEG	Remind me again why we're taking phonebooks to France? Alice gives her a look.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	I love my binder. I do.
M	ALICE	Where's Emma? She knows we're meeting, right?
F	MEG	Forgot her purse.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	You know, for the first time in a long time, I feel just as lucky as any of these kids. They may have their whole lives ahead of them but we've got a week in Paris.
M	ALICE	Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting your life is completely over. So sad. I'm really going to miss you.
F	MEG	Funny.
F	EMMA	Well, that was a close call! They turn to see Emma. crossing the parking lot holding a
F	MEG	Look at her. The only teacher in Racine County that wears four inch heels in six feet of snow.
M	ALICE	She always looks great, doesn't she? Damn her. My passport was in here!
F	MEG	Where'd you find it?
F	EMMA	Second floor girl's bathroom. Right where I left it. This Ooh, binders! Great! Alice passes one to Emma.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	You guys were so nice to ask me to come with--
M	ALICE	Emma, we're a team.
F	EMMA	I'd just be sitting around the condo, trolling e-Harmony...
F	MEG	The fact that you have trouble finding a date--
F	EMMA	I'm telling you, it's this town!
F	MEG	Gives me less than no hope.
F	EMMA	You know what we should do, Meg? When we're over there? we should all treat ourselves. Find a real salon. Total spa treatment. And I'm gonna get my hair done. Just like this! She holds up a European tabloid she's pulled from her purse,
M	ALICE	Look at us. Meg and Emma turn to Alice, smiling. We're really going.
M	ALICE	Come on... Please... please... Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 6. The zipper tears away from the suitcase witha loud RIP! is
M	FINN	She wants to see Paris, too!
F	MEG	Finn, if Edith goes to Paris with me, she can't go to Daddy's with you. Finn's brows come together as she considers this, then That's what I thought. Seamus! SEAMUS, Meg's ten year old son, pounds down the stairs
M	MEG (CONT'D)	Toothbrush? Seamus makes a face, drops his bag and heads back up the
M	FINN	Daddy! Remember. Gameboy goes to bed when you do. Nine o'clock.
M	GLENN	Seam, why don't you take your sister to the car while your mom and I talk. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 7.
M	FINN	Can we get on the radio?
M	MEG GLENN	No. No. Meg watches her kids run to the squad car parked at the curb,
M	GLENN	And no lights!
M	KARYN	Hey, Meg! Meg lifts her chin in greeting, but that's it.
M	GLENN	I uh... I heard from my lawyer. She said you'd signed your papers. Meg watches her kids climb in the car with Karyn.
M	GLENN (CONT'D)	Guess that makes us official, then.
F	MEG	You and me? Or...
M	GLENN	You and me, Meg. A beat as they look at one another, hold.
M	SEAMUS	Mom! Seamus reappears, charging up the walk to pull Meg down to
M	SEAMUS (CONT'D)	Have fun.
M	ANSWERING MACHINE	You have no messages. Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the
F	EMMA	Hello. You've reached the home of Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't be able to return your call right away, as I'm currently traveling. In Europe. But, please, do leave a message.

M	RICHARD	Special delivery.
M	ALICE	That's it! I am good to go! Richard brings a glass to Alice, nuzzles her ear.
M	RICHARD	I'm proud of you, you know. Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed,
M	ALICE	Like Christmas when I was a kid. There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight--
M	RICHARD	Good for me. They kiss.
M	ALICE	I mean, how long have I been talking about this?
M	RICHARD	Mmm... You were reading Colette. In the teacher's lounge. First time we met. Long time. Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside.
M	RICHARD (CONT'D)	This is just the beginning. It feels like it. They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass Oh. Richard... It's so... It's Richard takes her glass and fishes out the ring.
M	RICHARD	Let's try it on.
M	ALICE	But, we can't even celebrate--
M	RICHARD	What are you talking about? We're
M	ALICE	But, I'm leaving. I'm--. I'm getting on a plane in the morning. Maybe I want to make sure you come
M	BACK--	Wait. You're serious. Are you serious? You're serious.
M	ALICE	Let's do this when I get back. In a week.
M	RICHARD	Can you hear yourself?
M	ALICE	Honey, listen, it's just the timing. I wasn't planning on this
M	RICHARD	Whoa. I planned tonight. Tonight was my plan--
M	ALICE	And it's great. This is great. You're great. But, Richard, I feel like I just need to do this one thing first. Then I can do the next. Then I can do this. Can you understand? There's a world I haven't even seen yet... Alice, hopeful, searches Richard's inscrutable expression a
M	RICHARD	I thought we'd be seeing it together. Have a great trip, Alice. He heads for the door. Richard, come on. You're leaving?
M	RICHARD	Maybe I'll see you in a week. Alice listens to his footfalls and the slam of the front I'm sorry...
M	PILOT (PRE-LAP)	Ladies and Gentleman, we are about to begin our descent into Charles de Gaulle International Airport... She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack, She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
F	EMMA	Are we there?! Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 12.
M	CUSTOMS AGENT	Bien venue. Alice looks up from her imprinted passport, smiles hugely.
M	ALICE	Merci .
F	EMMA	There it is! Esprit de Corps! Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue
M	ALICE	Excuse me, are you Madame Valery? Madame Valery glances up from her clipboard beside their bus.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Hi, my name is Alice Perry-- Bags go under the bus.
M	ALICE	I'm traveling with my friends, Meg Kelly and Emma Lindgard-- I speak English.
F	EMMA	Well, that's great!
M	ALICE	We're so excited! Madame Valery eyes Alice unfolding a map from her binder. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 13. Now, I was hoping you could tell me which route the bus will be taking-- You're not going to be a problem, are you?
M	MADAME VALERY	On your right... Alice, squashed beside Meg on the over-crowded bus, whips her
M	MADAME VALERY (CONT'D)	Was the Arc de Triomphe.
M	ALICE	This is ridiculous...
F	EMMA	Hey, Alice! Meg! Alice and Meg turn to Emma across the aisle, who hooks a
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Can you believe? They're from St. Paul! On their honeymoon!
M	CARL	Waited a long time for this! But, we finally made it!
F	EMMA	Alice, that's like you! We're here celebrating my friend Meg's divorce! Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 14. Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making
M	ALICE	Try to remember that! We'll double back for the Chagalls! .Also called Nike of Samothrace. Greek goddess Nike, meaning victory. Two-twenty to one-ninety B. C. Okay, go! They head for the right stairs just as Madam Valery
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Oh. Alice turns Meg and Emma around to come back down.
M	DEEDEE	Well, that saved us a climb. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 15.
F	EMMA	I got it! I got it!
F	EMMA	Alice, I'll e-mail it to you. Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings.
F	MEG	At least she's smiling.
M	ALICE	What? No. I'm--. I'm just a little tired.
F	EMMA	Hey! I'll bet you have jet lag! We'll probably all get it! Meg raises a glass of wine.
F	MEG	To jet lag. Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk
M	MEG (CONT'D)	To Alice. Best organizer. Best guide. Best friend.
F	EMMA	To Alice! They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as
M	DEEDEE	Oh, Carl! Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 16.
M	CARL	I am so sorry!
M	ALICE	
M	DEEDEE	He was just looking for the catsup-
M	CARL	If you're not using it. As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her
M	ALICE	Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur-- Merci! He turns now, catsup in hand, to blink at the creme brulee
M	ALICE	Pardon, Madame, but... Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, but--
F	MEG	Are you apologizing?
M	ALICE	They've taken our dinners away-- Madame Valery taps her watch and then her clipboard.
M	MADAME VALERY	There were stragglers at the. museum. Now, I am behind schedule. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 17.
M	ALICE (PRE-LAP)	Look! Look at this picture and tell me what's different!
F	EMMA	Toujour le suck-ez vous.
M	ALICE	I researched at least a million
F	MEG	Well. This is the one we could afford. A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life. It's only five nights--
F	EMMA	Five nights? Here?!
F	MEG	And, Alice, you said yourself, we'll hardly ever be in our room. It'll be like camping. At Eagle River. It'll be fun! Emma opens what is essentially a closet with a toilet.
F	EMMA	Here's your outhouse, Meg. Go nuts. Alice joins Emma at the bathroom door. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 18. Me? I'm going to try to hold it.
F	MEG	Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack-- she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight
M	MEG (CONT'D)	Holy--! Alice, help-- Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift.
M	ALICE	Emma, what have you got in here?
F	EMMA	Just the stuff you put on my list-- And a couple options. The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Hey! Come on, guys! She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 19.
M	MADAME VALERY	The Pont des Arts has it's name for the vast number of art students that come here to paint this famous city view... Meg and Emma, the worse for wear, trail Madame Valery at a
M	ALICE	It's called the Pont des Arts because the Louvre was formally known as the Palais des Arts... Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and
M	MADAME VALERY	People! We must keep together!
M	DEEDEE	"Point zero. Dez roots dee France."
M	ALICE	It's from right here that all the highway miles in all of France are measured. They also say that if you stand on this exact spot, you are be destined to return to France in the future.
F	MEG	Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone! Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.
F	EMMA	I want a picture! Of all of us! Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 20.
M	MADAME VALERY	My head count was short in the cathedral.
M	ALICE	I'm sorry. I was explaining about Madame Valery sizes Alice up and taps her staff as the group
M	MADAME VALERY	This flag? I do not carry it for my pleasure.
M	ALICE	We were just on our way inside--
M	MADAME VALERY	Well, now you may head to the bus.
M	ALICE	But, we haven't been--
M	MADAME VALERY	Which is why you must follow my flag!
M	ALICE	okay. We will. I promise. But, these people haven't seen the
M	MADAME VALERY	There are many churches on the tour.
M	ALICE	But, this is Notre Dame! They need to see this--
M	MADAME VALERY	I assure you, they will see everything they need to see-- Well, what's the point if it's all a big fat blur? When nobody can see anything properly? Let alone experience it, or appreciate--
M	MADAME VALERY	You seem quite the Paris expert, for someone who has never been.
F	EMMA	Ill bet she knows more about it than you! The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera.
M	ALICE	I might not have ever been here before, but... I've waited my whole life for this trip.
M	CARL	We've waited thirty years--
F	MEG	You tell her, Carl.
M	ALICE	You keep rushing us through, like this is some kind of race-- And you won't even speak French with me. Now, I think I've been very nice. We're from Wisconsin. But, I'm telling you, I am not getting on that bus until my friends and I have seen Notre Dame. Meg and Emma exchange looks as Alice plants herself with
M	MADAME VALERY	Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied with my tour she could conduct her own.
F	EMMA	What'd she say? Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall With lightning speed, she seizes Madame Valery's flag.
M	CROWD	Whoa! Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag,
M	DEEDEE	Carl, we're getting on the bus! Madame Valery lunges for the stick.
F	EMMA	That was fantastic!
F	MEG	"A" plus! Alice, cheeks flushed, watches Carl waving goodbye from the bus's rear window.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	Alice, you okay? Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in
M	ALICE	Now, the real tour can begin!
F	MEG	Let's kick this town's ass! Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall.
F	EMMA	I think it's starting to rain--
M	ALICE	Who cares? We're in Paris! What's a little rain? Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 23. They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their
M	PHOTOGRAPHER 1	Cordelia! They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer
M	PHOTOGRAPHER 2	You're wasting your film. That's not her.
F	EMMA	What're they saying?
M	ALICE	Oh. Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	That, mes aims, is Paris.
F	EMMA	You think they'd let me use the bathroom?
F	EMMA	Wow. Merci. Okay, Emma, it's down the hall to the left. Meg and I'll go and get us a table--
F	EMMA	Meet you in there. Emma heads for the ladies room, gaping at the lobby.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Wow...
F	MEG	Get us a table? Alice, we can't afford to eat here--
M	ALICE	My treat.
M	ME G	You can't afford---
M	ALICE	We're going to do one thing right in Paris. I don't care how much it costs. They turn for the dining room, passing the front desk where
F	CORDELIA	And, just how do you propose I am to travel tomorrow, then?
M	CONCIERGE	I am sorry, but, there is nothing-- A MANAGER enters from the back.
M	MANAGER	Mademoiselle Scott, I have checked and there is no sign of a package--
F	CORDELIA	Marvelous. I'd like to see someone who speaks English, please. If there is such a person in France. The concierge and manager look to one another and back.
M	MANAGER	This is not English we are speaking?
F	EMMA	These are cloth! She takes the towel into one of the stalls, closing the door France. Cordelia's cellphone RINGS! and she pulls it from her purse.
M	EMMA (O.S.)	Hello? You would not believe these people. So rude! She takes her phone into the stall next to Emma's and closes And they wonder why none of us do Paris anymore! What I've been through--. And, Daddy is being
M	PERFECTLY HIDEOUS--	Alice and Meg look at one another in the mirror, overhearing
M	CORDELIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)	He's making me go to Monte Carlo!
M	ALICE	Emma?
M	EMMA (0. S.)	Yeah. I'm here. I don't know. Some auction. One of those foundations--. But, have I heard from them? No. And they were to take care of the plane--. Well, I'm certainly not going to go if, Wait, where are you? Reykjavik? Would I need a coat? A toilet flushes and Cordelia opens her stall door, heads for
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Do you know if there's an evening flight--? Alice and Meg turn to each other, then to Cordelia's
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Ooh, I think I can just make it. No. I won't even check out here. It's better if everyone thinks I'm being a good girl and taken the trip down to-- Cordelia stops when her eyes snag on Alice and Meg.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Let me call you when I get to the airport. It may take awhile... She gives Alice and Meg a devastating look up and down.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	It appears to be raining outside. Quite hard. She picks up her purse and exits without looking back just as
F	EMMA	Did you see those are cloth?
F	MEG	No, Emma, I mean, exactly like you.
F	EMMA	Well, she sounded awful. And kind of mean. Alice, Meg and Emma, punchy and a little drunk, enjoy wine
M	ALICE	She should be ashamed. Can you imagine having a room here and then not staying in it? An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass. Darling, I was thinking of ordering this entire menu, and then not eating it!
F	MEG	We should just take it. Her room.
F	EMMA	And her trip to Monte Carlo! That's still France, right?
F	MEG	Alice, how fast can you get a binder going on a trip like that? Oh, I'd love to see that. Us in Monte Carlo.
F	MEG	What's so funny about that? We got in here. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 28. Indeed. It is pitiful how low the standards here have fallen. Two waiters step in to clear plates, hearing all. Remind me to have Daddy buy this hotel so that I can knock it down. Alice and Meg laugh with Emma as the waiters head for the
M	WAITER	She is a monster!
F	MEG	Emma, you could be her! Darling, Meg. Always making me laugh! Who in their right mind would ever believe that I was--
M	MANAGER	Pardon, Mademoiselle Scott? The three look up at the manager in surprise.
M	ALICE	I'm so sorry. Were we being too loud?
M	MANAGER	No, no, we are all very happy to see Mademoiselle Scott smile... A WINE STEWARD hustles up to the table with an ice bucket
M	MANAGER (CONT'D)	Please. In apology for our earlier misunderstanding.
F	EMMA	Our misunder--?
M	MANAGER	Your dinners as well. With our compliments... The three women exchange glances as the steward begins to
F	EMMA	Excuse me, Monsieur?
M	MANAGER	Oui, Mademoiselle? Emma smiles, broadly, batting her eyelashes as the steward I so hate to be a bother, but I seem to have misplaced my room key.
F	EMMA	Scheize. Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated
M	ALICE	A view! There's a view. Alice races to push back the window sheers, revealing a The entire city of light is reflected in her eyes.
M	EMMA (O.S.)	Now this is more like it! Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 30.
F	MEG	There's whole other room in here!
M	ALICE	Wait. What are you guys doing? Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed.
F	EMMA	This is the room we were supposed to have!
M	ALICE	On what planet? Come on. We were only going to take a look!
F	MEG	So, we're looking. And we like what we see.
M	ALICE	Meg! Meg takes the bottle and crawls up with Emma.
F	EMMA	Alice, take a break, would you? We
M	WALKED EIGHTY-POINT-FOUR-SIX-SEVEN-	two kilometers... A lot happened today.
F	MEG	Alice, how many do chances do we get? For something like this? Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.
M	ALICE	Okay. But, just until it stops raining. Then we go. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 31.
F	MEG	Agreed. Alice climbs up and together, the three pass the bottle of I'm sorry, I just keeping thinking of the look on that woman's face!
F	EMMA	I'm glad I got pictures!
M	ALICE	I did surprise her--
F	MEG	Surprised me!
F	EMMA	Really loved that flag, didn't she?
M	ALICE	Poor Carl and Deedee... Do you think that if you sleep in a bed like this every night your dreams are different? Alice rolls to her side and the view of the Eiffel tower.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Like, are they bigger? You know? Do you dream a more amazing life? Meg kicks off her shoes, lets them drop.
F	MEG	Well... We'll never know. Seen from the bed, the light atop the Eiffel tower breaks The Eiffel tower gleams gold and orange in the morning sun. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 32. Hello?
F	EMMA	What time is it? Alice's eyes fly open as she snaps awake.
M	ALICE	Oh, yes. Yes... Meg, wake up. We're in trouble-- Meg pulls herself up, sees Alice on the phone. Oh, shiii--
M	ALICE	We'll be right down. Merci. She hangs up.
F	EMMA	We were only joking! We didn't mean to--!
F	MEG	We'll tell them it was a mistake!
F	EMMA	Alice?
M	ALICE	Cordelia, your car is here. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 33.
M	CONTINUED:	The women scurry for the exit past the desk manager.
M	MANAGER	Mademoiselle Scott!
M	ALICE	Just keep moving. The three women increase their pace, but the manager catches
M	MANAGER	Mademoiselle Scott, this came for you this morning. The package you were seeking? Emma merely blinks at the offered envelope.
F	MEG	Take it. Just take it. Thanks again! They break for the door, but the manager follows.
M	MANAGER	I'm afraid there may still be some
F	EMMA	What?
M	ALICE	Thank you so much but I think we'll But, you can not walk to the airport. The airport? A beat, as Emma and Meg look to Alice for direction and the It's fine. It's fine. We'll just have him drop us off... Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who
F	MEG	They really do think she's her... RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's
F	EMMA	What? I want to know where we're going.
M	ALICE	We're going back to our hotel-- Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin.
F	EMMA	No. We're going to Monte Carlo!
M	ALICE	No. We're not. Let me see that--
F	EMMA	Alice, what's "prive?" Is that like an airline?
M	ALICE	Emma, for crying out loud. Meg, you want to help me out here?
F	MEG	Hold on... I'm reading...
F	EMMA	See? Meg wants to go. Don't you, Meg?
M	ALICE	No, Meg, doesn't. Meg looks up from the itinerary, shrugs.
F	MEG	Trip's paid for, whether that girl takes it or not.
M	ALICE	Oh! And somehow that magically makes taking it right?
F	EMMA	What's the worst that could happen?
M	ALICE	I can think of a lot of things--
F	MEG	You're in charge. You want to go back to that hotel, okay by me. A beat while Alice looks between Meg and Emma, trapped. And, darling, we'll completely understand if you feel we shouldn't go.
M	ALICE	Okay. We go. We take a look around. We get on a train and come right back... Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 36.
F	MEG	Anything goes wrong, we say it was a language thing, that we didn't
F	EMMA	Now, I like that idea, because it's true! They fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of
M	ALICE	Go, look, come right back. It's a good plan. Alice, Meg and Emma clink glasses. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 37.
M	ALICE	Okay! What do we want to do first? Check out the palace, or the beach?
M	MEG EMMA	Beach! Palace?! Let's find a map--
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Mademoiselle Scott! They turn as JEAN-PIERRE MICHAND (late 30's), sophisticated
F	EMMA	Well, bon jour me.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	You made it! I was getting a little frantic--. When I did not hear from you--. So I sent your
M	TRAVEL--	But, you are here. Forgive me. Jean-Pierre. Michand. With the foundation-- He pauses in shaking Emma's hand as his eyes land on Alice
M	JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)	Welcome--. I---. I didn't realize you would be bringing--
F	EMMA	Oh, I'm sorry! This is Alice Perry and Meg Kelly. Two of my dearest friends. Visiting from America! Hello. Jean-Pierre has trouble pulling his eyes from Alice as he
M	JEAN-PIERRE	It is a pleasure to meet friends--
F	EMMA	I'll say. Emma sneakily indicates Jean-Pierre's empty ring finger to No ring.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	I'm terribly sorry, but, I am already late for a meeting--
F	MEG	We won't keep you--
M	JEAN-PIERRE	I just wanted to make sure you arrived safely and that I was here to greet you. Oh. And, of course, to deliver your invitations for the week, and the foundation's report-- Invitations for the week--?
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Various events. Leading up to the Again, I am so sorry, but, I am reluctant to keep His Highness waiting.
F	EMMA	His Highness?
M	JEAN-PIERRE	The Prince. But, we will see each other at the casino for tonight's game. Please, bring your friends--
M	ALICE	You are very generous, and we'd love to, but, I'm afraid Cordelia has other plans this evening-- Jean-Pierre turns, charmed by Alice's perfect French, and
M	ALICE	We're very sorry-- Perhaps we have misunderstood each other. Mademoiselle Scott--. She must be there for tonight's game. The prince. His Highness has asked to be seated across from her--
F	EMMA	What's he saying? Which prince? Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Please. It is for the foundation. Oh, would you look at these kids?
F	MEG	No, I can't. I can't stand it. Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating
F	EMMA	"With your help The Michand Foundation is able to sow the seeds of education, transforming lives, families, and villages, one child at a time..." She didn't say anything about a school!
F	MEG	Schools, with an "s." More than one. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 40 In Africa.
F	MEG	That horrible, irresponsible girl! I've never stolen a thing in my life, now I've taken a trip from school children.
M	ALICE	In Africa. Meg hangs her head.
F	EMMA	Reykjavik! That takes some nerve! They're counting on her for a charity auction and she doesn't even show up!
M	ALICE	Only she did. Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket.
F	EMMA	She did?
F	MEG	Do not touch that!
M	ALICE	You, Emma. If you're Cordelia. They've seen you. You're here.
F	EMMA	Well, I can't go to that thing tonight. I don't have anything to wear. The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can. Hello? Alice gestures for Emma not to say anything, to hang up. Oh yes, please. Send it up... Um. Yes, all of it. Everything. Thank you, ever so. Merci! She hangs up and holds a beat before turning to Alice.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	My luggage is here.
M	ALICE	Okay. But, just for tonight. And, that's it. CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open
F	EMMA	Lucky guess? A necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles No jewelry. Emma nods.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Then it.all goes back.
F	MEG	Dry-cleaned.
M	CONTINUED:	At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer But, this is because we know them; to all other eyes they not They glance at one another, eyebrows up: "We're here!"
F	EMMA	Don't you feel like we've won something already? Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Mademoiselle Scott, you made it! Emma withholds her natural smile, placing just the tips of
F	EMMA	Enchante. Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of
M	JEAN-PIERRE	And Mademoiselle Margaret Kelly and Mademoiselle Alice Perry-- I am very glad you were able to come this evening. Alice nods, blushes and tries to cover.
M	JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)	May I present His Highness, Prince Domenico Da Silvano? Prince Da Silvano bows from the waist.
F	EMMA	Please, call me "Cordelia."
M	DOMENICO	If you will call me "Domenico."
F	EMMA	I shall certainly try. Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean-
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Shall we? Alice and Meg allow Jean-Pierre to lead them, following Emma
F	MEG	I may as well be topless.
M	ALICE	Please. I'm mooning everyone behind us.
F	EMMA	Oh, but, I really wasn't planning on playing this evening. I so much prefer to watch-- Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads This I do not believe about you. He turns to the eight other PLAYERS (of various ages and
M	DOMENICO (CONT'D)	Ladies and gentlemen? Shall we begin? The other players make obligatory introductions and take up Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 44. Alice moves to sit, but then remembers her skirt, looks to Easier to see if we stand. Jean-Pierre hands them both a glass of Champagne.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	And why aren't you playing?
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Ah. I play behind the scenes. Like Robin Hood, I take from those who have more than enough, for those who have nothing but need. Also, I do not play because I have no money of my own. Alice smiles, charmed by his candor, but then stops.
M	ALICE	They're playing for money?
M	IS	They're playing for money. Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards
M	DOMENICO	Cordelia, why don't you do us the honor of setting this evening's stakes? Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her,
F	EMMA	Oh. Um. Okay... She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks. Alright. Why don't... Why don't we start at ten? A shocked player sputters into his drink. That is if anyone is able to make change. A beat. Jean-Pierre, Domenico and all the other players burst out
M	DOMENICO	Marvelous! He signals an ATTENDANT over as Emma's shoulders relax.
M	DOMENICO (CONT'D)	Please bring Mademoiselle Scott a rack of chips. Two hundred? Um. Sure.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	You would not know it, but she is very funny.
F	MEG	A riot. Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.
M	DOMENICO	Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten thousand a hand. Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from
M	DOMENICO (CONT'D)	You must be feeling very lucky.
M	DEALER	Mademoiselle Scott? It is your call. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 46. Emma sits locked in a cool stare-down over the top of her
F	MEG	I should probably keep this. Mademoiselle? Emma places her cards face down before her, appears to fold.
F	EMMA	Well... She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside I'm all in. The other players gasp and Alice fails to suppress a whimper
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Are you alright?
M	ALICE	Great. I'm just--. Excuse me. Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	I'm terribly sorry to interrupt. But, Cordelia, you look a little overheated... Why don't we--? .Have you completely lost your mind? Hey. Don't distract me. I'm in the middle of a hand--
M	ALICE	Emma! That isn't Monopoly money!
F	EMMA	Relax. I've got it under control--
M	ALICE	And this isn't the mathletes finals in Kenosha!
F	EMMA	Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and get Alice some water? You're the one that got us into this--!
M	ALICE	What?!
M	DOMENICO	I will see you, Cordelia. Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the
F	EMMA	Now, go sit down and try to be cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me handle this. Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes
F	MEG	What'd she say? What'd she say? We're going down, Meg. Going down hard.
M	DEALER	Mademoiselle. Your Highness. Your 0 cards, please. Alice and Meg turn helplessly to the game table.
M	DOMENICO	Ladies first.
F	EMMA	After you. Please. Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his
M	DOMENICO	I am very sorry, Cordelia. A beat, then Emma shrugs.
F	EMMA	Well. It is just a game after all. She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	I do hope there are no hard feelings. The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes.
M	DOWAGER	You must play often, Miss Scott.
F	EMMA	Oh, a little, online. But, this is so much more fun!
M	DOMENICO	Not even a last drink in the bar? Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 49.
F	EMMA	It's been such a splendid evening, I am reluctant to press my luck any further.
F	MEG	Yeah. Good call, Cordelia. DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico
M	DOMENICO	Then you must promise to dance with me at my party tomorrow. Emma evades Domenico by stepping onto the elevator.
F	EMMA	Oh, Delmonico--
M	DOMENICO	"Domenico."
F	EMMA	I would not miss it for the world.
F	MEG	Great meeting you, your Highness. Good times. Really. Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Tomorrow night?
F	EMMA	Wait! Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	You must keep this one. For your foundation.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	But, your family has already been
M	ALICE	She really believes in education. The doors start to close.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Good night, then.
M	DOMENICO	And, welcome to Monte Carlo. The doors close, leaving Jean-Pierre and Domenico to gaze Heads turn as they set out together. --Alice twirls in a navy dress with white polka dots.
M	SHOP GIRL	Would you like these put on your account, Mademoiselle Scott?
M	ALICE	No. Thank you, we'll be paying
F	EMMA	But, it would be darling if you could have them sent round our hotel.
F	MEG	Wait. You know what, on second thought, I'm not getting these-- She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.
F	EMMA	But, they looked amazing on you!
F	MEG	Where was I ever going to wear them? Seriously?
F	EMMA	You wear them here! Anywhere! Alice, you tell her-- Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander
M	ALICE	No. I'm not going to tell you what to do.
F	MEG	Thank you. It's silly, anyway. They're just jeans. I want to find something for the kids--
F	EMMA	Oh, Meg! Look! For Finn! Emma leaps to one of the stalls, seizing a profusion of
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	How perfect is this?!
M	ALICE	Even better! Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them Oh. And the suitcase. The shop owner retrieves Alice's mended suitcase from a
M	RICHARD (CONT'D)	How much do I owe you for that?
M	GLENN	Hey, Richard! Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with Richard finishes helping Glenn and the kids transfer grocery So, we'll see you at seven then--
M	RICHARD	And that's two with sausage, extra sauce, no onions--
M	SEAMUS	Thin crust.
M	RICHARD	Got it. Richard picks up Alice's suitcase.
M	FINN	Are you going to France, too?
M	RICHARD	No. I just-- Glenn turns, noticing the suitcase for the first time.
M	GLENN	Whoa! Hold on! You're going to surprise Alice--?
M	FINN	I love surprises!
M	RICHARD	What? No, I---
M	GLENN	Oh, man, I win! Richard blinks as Glenn claps him on the shoulder.
M	GLENN (CONT'D)	Meg and I've had this bet going: She thought it would be on Alice's next birthday, but I knew it was going to be this trip to France!
M	RICHARD	Glenn, listen--
M	GLENN	Don't worry! I won't blow it for you! I won't call anyone, ruin the You sly dog! You've probably booked the best suite in Paris. Am I right? Got the ring, the whole show--. This is so you!
M	RICHARD	So...me?
M	GLENN	Sure! That's why Alice loves you. You get how much this trip's meant to her; now, you're just putting the icing on the cake. The big gesture, you know? Not too dominating: Supportive. Loving! You're the man, Richard. Big props. Glenn pulls Richard into a big happy bear hug.
M	GLENN (CONT'D)	Congratulations.
M	RICHARD	Glenn. She said, no. He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce, She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 55.
F	MEG	Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. I'd like to. But... The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	I don't have a kitchen. No place to cook.
M	BERNARD	She is only a visitor. Without a kitchen. But, it is a beautiful fish. Maybe next time. Meg turns to find Bernard beside her.
M	BERNARD (CONT'D)	I have explained. Meg hesitates uncertainly before this friendly stranger.
F	MEG	Well, thank you... She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to find
M	BERNARD	You are American. Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious,
F	MEG	From Wisconsin. Yes. Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.
M	BERNARD	You cook in Wisconsin? Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.
F	MEG	I try. But... We don't have even half of this at home. She points to a tray of miniature lobsters.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	Like those. I've only seen them in magazines.
M	BERNARD	Ah, langoustines. Many ways to
F	MEG	I'd go for a saute, being a Midwestern gal.
M	BERNARD	Court-bouillon. Poaching.
M	BERNARD	With sea water. Amazing.
F	MEG	So, you cook. Bernard dips his head modestly.
M	BERNARD	As you say, "I try." Bernard. Rochand. Meg shakes his hand and returns the handkerchief.
F	MEG	Meg. Kelly. Thank you again for
M	BERNARD	And, how long are you in Monte Carlo, Meg? Meg's brow furrows slightly and she turns to head back.
F	MEG	I need to find my--. . My friends are around here somewhere...
M	BERNARD	I will help you find them. We can Look. It was nice to meet you--
M	BERNARD	"Bernard."
F	MEG	Yeah. But, I'm gonna walk myself. Thanks, though. She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as
M	RICHARD	It's been two days and it didn't occur to you to call anyone?
M	MADAME VALERY	She refused to follow my instructions. She sabotaged my tour. Ruined it for everyone!
M	RICHARD	Wait. Alice did? Alice Perry?
M	MADAME VALERY	She took my flag!
M	RICHARD	But, if their luggage is still there, then they're missing--
M	GLENN	Missing? What the--? Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 58.
M	RICHARD	How do I get in touch with the police?
M	GLENN	Hey, I'm the police!
M	RICHARD	Are you the police in France?
M	MADAME VALERY	The police? Monsieur. Nothing could keep her from seeing Paris her way. Believe me. She was very determined.
M	GLENN	What's she saying?
M	MADAME VALERY	You are the husband, yes? Richard hesitates, looks to Glenn. Yes. I am the husband. Glenn nods emphatically. Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara,
F	MEG	Alice, she's fine... Look where we are! Can you even remember the last time we danced like this? It's gotta be-Martha Lapland's wedding--
M	ALICE	Actually, sometimes Richard and I go to Madison's on Saturdays--
F	MEG	The gay bar?
M	ALICE	They've got the best music.
F	MEG	I am so butting in on that. Alice laughs and spins, crashing directly into Jean-Pierre.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	And I was looking for you! From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s), He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.
F	EMMA	Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty! Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	It's a wonderful party, isn't it? Nikolai nods and offers her another glass of Champagne.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Cordelia, she can take care of herself, yes?
M	ALICE	What? Oh, yeah, of course... Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo
F	MEG	No, thanks. She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO (40's, sexy, Euro- Yes! Giorgio!
F	EMMA	Don't you need to, like, circulate?
M	NIKOLAI	Ya znal, chto naydu tebya. Emma blushes as though showered in compliments.
F	EMMA	Really? Cordelia Winthrop Scott. Emma turns, still smiling, to find PENELOPE PENROSE (late
F	EMMA	Yes?
M	PENELOPE	Do you not know who I am? Emma's smile falters as she glances furtively about.
F	EMMA	Um. 'Course I do... Hi.
M	PENELOPE	Penelope. Penelope Penrose. Penelope's chin quivers as she reads Emma's blank look.
M	PENELOPE (CONT'D)	I spent a year in hospital--
F	EMMA	Hospital? What happened?!
M	PENELOPE	You did! You happened! Alice swivels around at the raised voices, spots Penelope She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in
M	PENELOPE	Don't pretend you don't remember! Third year at Le Rosey! You threw my luggage in the pool. Set fire to my mattress. You cut off all my
F	MEG	What? That's awful!
M	PENELOPE	While I was sleeping
F	EMMA	She did that to you? Cordelia! How could you?
M	PENELOPE	That was just the first night.
M	ALICE	Say you're sorry, Cordelia. And let's get out of here!
F	EMMA	Alice, no--. Wait a minute--
M	PENELOPE	she turned all my friends against me... They had to send me away... To live with the nuns-- Emma grabs Penelope by the shoulders.
F	EMMA	Now, you listen to me, Penelope Penrose. You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment. Penelope flinches, preparing for a beating.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	But, I had no way of finding you after you left us, and...Oh, Penny. Don't you see? Don't you know that I was just jealous? Alice and Meg exchange looks. Jealous?
F	EMMA	You were so smart. So clever and
M	PENELOPE	I was ugly--
F	EMMA	No, Penny. I was ugly. I was a monster.
M	PENELOPE	Penny Pignose. That's what you called me--
F	EMMA	Because, I knew I could never compete! Not with anyone as special as you.
M	PENELOPE	You thought I was special? Emma looks at Penelope, nods emphatically.
F	EMMA	You want to know what I've waited for all these years, Penelope Penrose? Penelope shakes her head almost imperceptibly.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	To do this. Emma opens her arms wide and pulls Penelope into a hug. Now... Friends?
M	DOMENICO	To friends! old and new! Emma seizes Penelope's hand from across the table, placing it
F	EMMA	"Make new friends and keep the old, one is silver and the other's gold!" Alice and Jean-Pierre lean toward each other intimately'
M	JEAN-PIERRE	But, no one really lives here. Monte Carlo. It's like Hong Kong. People merely come and go. People like me. Well, and then, people like yourself. Alice nods to a WAITER who arrives to refill her Champagne
M	ALICE	People like me?
M	JEAN-PIERRE	People with money. This is why I come. I help assuage their guilt when I remind them that there are children in this world who do not have clean water to drink, while they drink Champagne.
M	ALICE	And that works? Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	I take myself far too seriously.
M	ALICE	No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--. I've seen the pictures of the schools. The work you do is
M	JEAN-PIERRE	And I'm afraid I talk about it because I myself am not that interesting... I'd rather know about you. Oh. Well. You know. I...do what I can, here and there. A little volunteer work... She turns to her Champagne, rolling her eyes at herself.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Oh, brother. Meg sits further down the length of all the tables laid end
F	MEG	Okay, wait. You're a man, right? Giorgio laughs. Yeah, I know: I'm funny. But, see if you can answer something for me. Ten years you're married, to the girl you dated in high school. I'm talking the girl you lost your virginity to, the one who gave you two great kids that you're just crazy about. Then one morning, what? You wake up, and out of the blue, it's like, "Oh, hey, honey, I think I'm in love with this other woman..." His patrol partner. A beat as Giorgio shakes his head sadly.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	I thought I was his partner. Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on.
M	GIORGIO	You heart feels betrayed.
F	MEG	I feel like I failed.
M	GIORGIO	I tell you this: A man...he will always love the mother of his children. Meg blinks, taking this in.
M	GIORGIO (CONT'D)	Now you must kiss someone else. Oh, I see--
M	GIORGIO	To break the spell. You must! Then you will be free. A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the
F	MEG	Oh, I'm sorry, 'I didn't order-- She looks up to find Bernard standing in chef's whites.
M	BERNARD	Madame Kelly. He heads toward for the kitchen before she can say anything.
F	EMMA	And you're my friend...and you're my friend. . .and you're my-- She turns with the bottle to find Nikolai who has
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Oh, hey! You were at the party! Do you work here, too? Nikolai cheerfully shakes his head, holds up her purse. Oh! Did I forget that? Wow, what a lifesaver! Thanks!
M	NIKOLAI	Ti takaya vaskhititel'naya. Emma sets the bottle down to concentrate on Nikolai.
F	EMMA	You're not from here, are you? I'm Emm--. My name is Cordelia.
M	NIKOLAI	Nikolai.
M	ALICE	The stars are still out. Ahead, Emma breaks away from Penelope and Domenico, leaving
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Where's Meg? Alice looks around and sees Giorgio walking alone among the
M	ALICE	I thought she was right behind us--
M	BERNARD	Papa, sit down. Rest. You do cook. Bernard shrugs, smiling as he comes forward.
M	BERNARD	You enjoyed your meal?
F	MEG	Adding the fresh orange; nice. Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	But, a little fennel would've been "wow."
M	BERNARD	Next time, you cook.
F	EMMA	Meg! What are you doing? Come on! We're going to watch-- Emma and Alice stop short just outside in the street, pausing
M	ALICE	We were--. We're going to watch the sunrise. Meg hesitates, turning between her friends and Bernard. You should not miss it.
M	ALICE	The guy from the market?
F	EMMA	He is so cute! And a cook--!
F	MEG	Chef .
F	EMMA	And you're single now! Meg slows to a stop, stands a beat. I'm single. I'm single, now.
M	ALICE	You know, Julia Child didn't take her first cooking class until she was thirty seven. I told you that.
M	PENELOPE	It's coming, Cordelia! The sun! Alice, Emma and Meg, arms linked, round the corner into the
F	MEG	We'd be getting up now.
M	ALICE	If we were home.
F	EMMA	But, we're not.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Cordelia! The spell is broken by a TRIO OF PAPARAZZI who spring to life
M	PAPARAZZI	Cordelia! Cordelia!
F	EMMA	Oh, good! I want a picture! Of the three of us! All of us! The paparazzi swarm from the steps towards Emma.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	By the fountain! She runs for the sprays of water, pulling Alice and Meg, and
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Penelope! Come on. I want one with everybody! Penelope, Domenico and Jean-Pierre join with other members of
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Okay! Ready? One, two-- Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 70. She spots Nikolai observing at a short distance.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	Wait! Wait! Niki! He shakes his head, bashful, but Emma gestures him over, Nikolai, you, too! I need all my friends--Whoops! Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards
M	RICHARD	Excuse me. Pardon me. Richard skirts around a man with a newspaper to retrieve the As Richard exits, the man folds his newspaper to its bold
F	EMMA	Alice, have you seen my sandals?
M	ALICE	Okay, there's a two o'clock and a four o'clock train to--
F	EMMA	Train? Where are you going? Alice looks up and takes in Emma's costume.
M	ALICE	Where are you going?
F	EMMA	I'm going to the beach. With Penelope. Meg enters through the suite's door carrying a bakery bag.
F	MEG	Breakfast is here! There's this fantastic bakery around the corner. I've already had three brioche. And I saw the greatest little shop for the kids, but they weren't open
M	YET--	What's going on? What happened?
F	EMMA	I don't know. She's talking about train schedules... Emma trails off as she and Meg and Alice look between each
M	ALICE	We need to start packing, right? If we're going back to Paris--
F	EMMA	Back to Paris?
M	ALICE	That was the plan--
F	MEG	What plan?
F	EMMA	We're not staying for the auction?
M	ALICE	We were just going to come down, take a look around and--
F	MEG	That was before we knew it was for a charity. Remember the kids?
F	EMMA	In Africa.
M	ALICE	The ones we stole a trip from? The kids who are paying for this room?
F	MEG	Alice, what's with you? We'll pay for the room--
F	EMMA	We're rich!
M	ALICE	So, I'm the only one worried about the fact that we're lying to everyone we've met?
F	MEG	Lying? To who? Jean-Pierre?
F	EMMA	You're the one who said we had to go to the casino--
M	ALICE	And now I'm apparently the only who's worried we might get caught.
F	MEG	She's in Iceland.
M	ALICE	One of her friends is bound to find out, or her family--
F	MEG	What friends?
F	EMMA	I've got friends. The doorbell rings and they turn their heads in unison, then A beat. Emma goes to the door, finding Penelope, also dressed for the
M	PENELOPE	Have you seen?
F	EMMA	Oh, my god! We look great! Alice, look! Alice takes the paper, Meg reading over her shoulder. We have got to get that in the yearbook.
M	PENELOPE	Yearbook?
M	ALICE	Penelope, could you excuse us?
M	PENELOPE	Oh. of course. Where--? Alice shows Penelope to the bedroom, closes the door and This is what I'm talking about! This is why we have to go--
F	EMMA	Doesn't it mean we have to stay?
F	MEG	Oh, this is so typical. Just because it's not on your map, 'cause you didn't plan it--. We all agree to take this adventure and then you won't jump.
M	ALICE	I won't--? Jump? Meg drops into a chair, mumbling an aside to herself.
F	MEG	Now I know how Richard must feel. Alice comes to a full stop and gapes at Meg, stung.
M	ALICE	Richard...? I'm just saying...
M	ALICE	Well, you're sure one to talk. Meg's eyes flick up to Alice. You can't even bring yourself to buy a pair of jeans anymore--
F	EMMA	Okay, you know what? Let's just pack. It's not fun anymore. Alice, if you think we should go, then that's what we're gonna do. You're in charge. Meg scoffs, an exasperated exhale.
M	ALICE	No way. Not anymore I'm not. You want to go to the beach? Go to the beach. You want to go the market? Go! "Liberte, egalite, fraternite!"
F	EMMA	What does that mean? Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door.
M	ALICE	It means everyone should do exactly what they want.
F	MEG	Exactly.
F	EMMA	Alice, wait! Where are you--? You're not going back to Paris--? Me? No. I'm going to have an adventure. She exits, slamming the door behind her.
F	MEG	Don't look at me like that. The door opens, and Alice re-enters, striding across the room
M	ALICE	I just--. My guide book. She picks up her book and crosses back to the door.
M	CARL	Alice? She glances up to find Carl and Deedee from the tour.
M	DEEDEE	We thought that was you!
M	ALICE	Oh! Carl! Deedee! Alice is surprisingly overcome and impulsively throws her
M	DEEDEE	Well, we're sure surprised to see you, too! Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 76.
M	ALICE	But, what are you doing here? How did you--?
M	CARL	Well, when we saw how you stood up to that Madame Valery--! If Alice can do that, we thought, what the heck's holdin' us back? This is our honeymoon!
M	DEEDEE	I was scared, but then, well, you only live once! And as long as we've got each other--
M	CARL	We've got everything, right? Alice blinks, unaccountably teary eyed.
M	ALICE	Yes. That's right.
M	CARL	Sometimes you've just gotta follow take care of itself.
M	CARL	Tell the girls we would have loved to see them, but--
M	DEEDEE	Italy calls! And Greece! We're even thinking of hitting Turkey! Imagine! We'll send you postcards. 0 Alice puts her friends in the taxi, closing the door as
M	ALICE	Enjoy every second of it!
M	DEEDEE	You, too, honey!
M	CARL	Bon voyage! The car pulls away, Carl and Deedee turning in their seats to A beat. Alice sighs and pulls out her guide book, unfolding a map as She takes in the quiet street, the view of the ocean, then
M	ALICE	is Go. Go home. She turns and starts forward, the dog following.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Don't follow me. I have no idea where I'm going... The dog cocks its head in comment.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Okay? Alice turns to climb the street's incline. Emma turns, lit by an idea, and pulls the'steel briefcase
M	EMILE	Madame?
F	MEG	Just one. He leads her to a table along the wall and holds out a chair. 0 Meg matches the broad smile that sweeps Bernard's face. He quickly unfolds it to the photograph of Alice and Meg with As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces
M	GIORGIO	Where is Meg? I do not see her.
F	EMMA	No. I... I don't think she's 0 coming. I'm sorry. Emma drifts away to the ship's rail where she turns to
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Cordelia! There she is! Cordelia! The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat,
M	PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)	Smile, Cordelia! Please, smile! Emma waves, but can't seem to manage that smile.
M	NIKOLAI	Ty v poryadke? Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie,
F	EMMA	Niki. He bows slightly, offering the cake.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	You work here too? You never get a night off... He smiles, shaking his head, hands her the cake.
M	NIKOLAI	Ya sa-meey shas-li-veey che-lo-vek na zem-le, pa-ta-mu chto u me-nya yest' tee. Emma hangs on every incomprehensible word.

F	EMMA	Oh, Niki... I'm so glad you found me. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 81.
F	MEG	Seamus. He's ten. Built a website for his fourth grade class. Now he's got actual clients. And that's Finn, the prima ballerina. She'll be six in June-- Emile examines photographs of Seamus and Charlotte from Meg's
M	EMILE	Elle est coquin, oui?
F	MEG	Oh, she's no chicken. She's not scared of anything-- Not a chicken. He says, she looks like a rascal. No idea where she gets that... Meg lifts her glass with a sly smile as Bernard brings plates
M	MEG (CONT'D)	But, that's a nice word for it.
M	ALICE	I'm open! I'm open! Alice sails down the makeshift soccer field as one of the
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Go! Go! Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 82. Alice races back down the field with her team, the little dog
M	BERNARD	But, she is perfectly safe.
F	MEG	Yeah. No. No way. Bernard straddles a beat up moped, motor running, as Meg
M	BERNARD	I can not take you, if you will not get on.
F	MEG	What do you want me to tell you? I'm not getting on that thing. Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics. He swings a leg over the moped, revs the engine.
F	MEG	Hold on.
F	MEG	How do you say "faster?"
M	BERNARD	The best chefs of Monte Carlo. They come here to drink and show off. The end of every night. HENRI (60's, a bear in chef's whites) lumbers towards them.
M	HENRI	No! No! No! We are only cooks allowed here!
M	BERNARD	Ah, but, this is why we've come! I have finally found someone who can teach you how to cook! This is Meg, from America. And this is Henri, the worst egotist, my mentor. The two men embrace, merrily kissing each other on both
M	HENRI	A chef from America! Come to flip hamburgers! Then he spots Alice running-around. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 84. Jean-Pierre's smile winks out as Alice drops and he races The little dog licks Alice's face and she opens her eyes.
M	ALICE	I'm up! I'm up! Let's go! She sets off down the field with the kids. Emma turns to look back at the silent boat.
F	EMMA	It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you to clean up all alone. I'll help. But, you've really got to talk to your boss. Nikolai laughs, shaking his head.
M	NIKOLAI	Ya ryadom.
F	EMMA	It must get kind of lonely sometimes... Not being understood. I know how that can feel. Nikolai holds up the napkin he's transformed into a crown Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 85. My princess. They look at one another for a beat, then simultaneously turn You get me. Nikolai looks down at his hand on the edge of the deck next
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	You get me. Meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 86. What's the most amazing place you've ever been?
M	JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)	Hard to say. There are many. Alice steps out onto the hotel's roof with Jean-Pierre's
M	ALICE (V.O.)	Well, Africa, then. How often do you get to go? He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
M	JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)	Not enough. Mostly I am on planes. To the places where sunlight and parties make people generous.
M	ALICE	That seems a shame...
M	JEAN-PIERRE	But, I can think of one place I have never been. It is in my imagination only, so it is very special. He places an arm around Alice as they take in the view.
M	JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)	It is just a small town, in a vast, open space. Maybe in the middle of America. There are people there like yourself, who are kind. And children who have everything they need. Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair
M	JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)	In my mind, it is bordered by fields that are green. 0 Alice breaks the moment by turning her head to search the far Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game,
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Come with me.
M	ALICE	What?
M	JEAN-PIERRE	To Dubai. I leave the day after--. What is today? Friday? I leave tomorrow. You could come too. You wouldn't need to bring anything.
M	ALICE	But--. Jean-Pierre... You don't know me.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	This is why I ask. I would like to know you, Alice. Very much. Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from
M	ALICE	Before this, I'd never even been to France. Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	It's true. Just kept putting it off. Always managed to find an excuse. But, really, it was that I was afraid. That it couldn't ever live up to the France I'd imagined. And if it did... Then I'd never be able to go home.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	And, now? Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and
M	ALICE	But, thank you. She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	For everything. Alice steps into her room and closes the door. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 89.
M	RICHARD	Excusez-moi...I'm looking for the train. To Monte Carlo. Behind him, Cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop
F	CORDELIA	Yes, Daddy, I'm here. No, I do not see a driver. Yes, I am looking! The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit.
M	RICHARD	Merci. He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a
M	DRIVER	Mademoiselle Scott?
F	CORDELIA	Where have you been? The driver leads her away, neither she nor Richard having
M	ME G	Well, this is me. Back to the old Grimaldi suite. I have to open the restaurant.
M	CONTINUED:	A beat as they face each other, neither knowing how to end
F	MEG	Thank your father for me?
M	BERNARD	I will, Meg.
F	MEG	Thank you. Meg hugs him briefly, awkwardly, then turns for the steps.
M	BERNARD	Goodbye, Meg. Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard.
M	ALICE	Well, I wish you were there. Or here. I wish you were here, Richard. I do... Because I keep thinking, no matter what I see, I'm only seeing half of it. Because we're not seeing it together... Meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom,
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, Richard. I hope you'll be there when I get home... Because that's all I want. Alice hangs up the phone, so lost in thought she doesn't see Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 91. Hey. Alice looks up, smiles to see her friend.
M	ALICE	Oh. Hey-- Hey! You bought the jeans! They look great--!
F	MEG	Alice, I am so sorry! For what I said. About you. And Richard. I didn't mean any of it! I love you. I don't know how I would've gotten through the past six months if it weren't for you--
M	ALICE	No. It's okay. You were right-- Oh, Meg! I made a huge mistake!
F	MEG	Wha--?
M	ALICE	Richard asked me to marry him--
F	MEG	Wait. What? When?
M	ALICE	I told him we should wait a week!
F	MEG	No. You didn't--
M	ALICE	I did! He surprised me!
F	MEG	Alice...
M	ALICE	I'd imagined him asking me a million times, but then when he did, I just panicked. suddenly all I could think about was the trip.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	That I hadn't already been to France. It was like this wave, all the years, and chances I'd had but didn't take, they just crashed down on me: And I hadn't seen anything but the end of Lake Avenue. The only clear thought in my head was, "this guy is so wonderful, how can he marry half a person?"
F	MEG	But, Alice. You were going. We were on our way.
M	ALICE	I thought he was asking me to make a choice. But, he wasn't. He wasn't doing that at all. It was me. Because I couldn't believe he loved me just for who I was. France or no. All I had to do was say, "yes."
F	MEG	Honey, Richard knows you... It might feel like it's over. But, I really ruined it this time... The suite's doorbell rings and they both look up.
F	EMMA	Thanks. I couldn't find--. I musta left my key someplace... But, what does it matter, really? When I already have everything I'll ever need... Alice exchanges a look with Meg as Emma swans across the Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 93. Moooorning, Meg... For the first time in my life, everything makes perfect sense, you know?
F	MEG	I'm trying to follow you--
F	EMMA	I'm in love! I am! Oh, you guys, I'm in love with Niki... Nikolai... Nikolai. And, I don't care if he is just a busboy. Or waiter. Whatever he is... Alice unfolds the paper, taking in the image of Emma wearing
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	It's funny if you think about it. I could have had a prince. A real one. But, I wanted my Niki-- Hey. Why are you guys crying?
M	ALICE	I thought we said no jewelry--
F	EMMA	No--? What jewelry?
F	MEG	What? Alice holds up the newspaper.
F	EMMA	Ooh, that's a good one!
M	ALICE	The necklace, Emma! Emma's face clouds as she distractedly reaches a hand to her
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Emma, where's the necklace--? Emma leaps up and races to the window, throwing the doors 0
F	EMMA	The yacht! There! I left it on--!
F	MEG	Are you kidding me?!
M	PHOTOGRAPHERS (O.S.)	Cordelia! Cordelia! They look directly down to the base of the hotel where the
F	EMMA	Oh, hey. What's she doing here?
M	DESK CLERK	Mademoiselle Scott! Cordelia looks at him with typical, withering disdain.
F	CORDELIA	The driver was late. The clerk's smile falters, fades.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Hello? I'm checking in. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 95. Hello?!
F	CORDELIA	Beijing? Oh, I want to come! Will you wait for me?
F	CORDELIA	I can be there in, say, a day-- I was meant to have a suite. Of course, they've screwed this up as well--. Who else is going? The bellhop opens the bedroom doors, revealing the tower of
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Put those with the others-- Wait, wait! She spins away for the French doors, twisting their handles, Stavros is supposed to be here, isn't he? I don't see his boat! Alice carefully turns to Meg and Emma who look back her with
M	BELLBOY (O.S.)	Mademoiselle? Majorca?! Hold on. She does a quick turn, marches inside.
F	CORDELIA	Yes? He nods, not quite with his hand out, but waiting.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	If you're done, you may go. The bellboy turns but hesitates in catching a quick glimpse
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	I said, you can go. He bows a retreat, backing out the door.
F	MEG	They're locked!
M	CONTINUED:	They each look about for a route of escape.
M	MEG (CONT'D)	No. Forget it. Alice laces her fingers together, turning to Emma.
M	ALICE	Emma, help.
M	ALICE	You're first. There's a door on
F	EMMA	The roof?!
F	MEG	Why'd they have to park so far out, anyway?!
M	ALICE	One point five million Euros, Emma!
F	EMMA	I said I was sorry! You think I would have worn it if I knew how much it cost? Busy fighting, none of them notice as Nikolai's boat passes
F	MEG	What am I going to tell my kids?! How am I'm going to explain to Glenn that we're in a French jail?
M	ALICE	For the auction, Emma!
F	MEG	My kids'll be in college when we get out! They won't even know me.
F	EMMA	None of us knew that, Alice--
F	MEG	Trespassing. Burglary. Oh, god. Grand larceny, by trick and
M	ALICE	For the children--!
F	EMMA	In Africa. I know!
F	MEG	I'm standing in a stolen boat!
F	EMMA	Well, sit down then! Nikolai's wake hits the dinghy, rocking them hard.
F	EMMA	It was right here!
F	MEG	Oh, I can't believe this... Meg doubles over, hands on her knees as Emma stands over the
M	ALICE	Are you even sure you took it off?
F	EMMA	Definite "yes."
M	ALICE	Well... Were you this close to the edge? I mean, it could've fallen--
F	MEG	Do not even say it!
F	EMMA	0 You know, I'm getting a little tired of this. Just because I
M	ALICE	Emma, we're not talking about a pair of sunglasses!
F	MEG	We don't have time for this! Let's just split up! Alice you go fore, Emma take the aft, and I'll check the cabin. Emma glares at Alice with steely, narrowed eyes.
F	EMMA	Alright. Fine. Which way is aft?
M	CLERK	Yes?
M	NIKOLAI	Ya khotel by perepisyvat'sya s vami.
M	CLERK	Excusez moi, monsieur?
F	MEG	Nice boat. No necklace.
M	ALICE	Where is he, anyway?
F	EMMA	He just works here. I don't-- You don't think he could have taken it, do you?
F	MEG	Who knows?! I mean, is there anyone who understands a word he says?! Oh, this could all be my fault! He probably thought he needed it, to finance our new life together. The temptation was just too much for
M	ALICE	Emma, it's your fault because you wore it in the first place!
F	EMMA	He works like fifteen jobs already! You don't know what it's like being around rich people all the time--
F	MEG	Actually, we do. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 101. Pozhalujsta. Gratitude, Mummy. That's what I'm talking about. It's just so unfair the way Daddy assumes I've nothing better to do than-- The hotel phone rings, interrupting her complaint.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Hold on. She picks up the ringing telephone at the desk. I cannot understand you. She hangs up, heads for the fruit basket with her cell.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	Mummy, Mummy, I'm just saying I wish someone, anyone, would consider my feelings. Just once. She snatches up an apple from the basket without looking.
M	CORDELIA (CONT'D)	You go ask him how much he thinks a simple "thank you" might cost. She hangs up her cell with a sniff and raises the apple, Cordelia pulls the newspaper from the trash, curiosity
M	ALICE	Well, we're just going to have to talk to her.
F	MEG	Oh, yeah, that was the first thing that struck me about her. How reasonable she seemed--
F	EMMA	Yeah, we'll just explain.
F	MEG	We should have sailed that yacht right back to Wisconsin-- it was an accident. This whole
F	MEG	You think she'd fit in one of those trunks of hers--?
M	ALICE	Meg?
F	MEG	Just thinking out loud.
F	EMMA	You never know. She might understand. CLICK! She rips the lid open to reveal the empty velvet Richard holds up the newspaper with Emma's photo.
M	RICHARD	I need to find this woman-- The clerk puts up a finger as he lifts the receiver.
M	CLERK	Une moment, Monsieur. Pardon. Behind Richard, Nikolai crosses from the bank of house phones
F	CORDELIA	Send security! Immediately! This is Cordelia Winthrop Scott. I've been robbed! At the desk, the clerk hangs up one phone to pick up another,
M	CLERK	Pardon.
M	SECURITE--	The clerk stops, spotting Emma as she, Alice and Meg, sprint Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 104.
M	ALICE	Oh! Richard whips around to see Alice spread-eagled on the marble
M	RICHARD	Alice?
M	MEG ALICE	Richard! Richard--?
M	RICHARD (CONT'D)	Alice!
F	EMMA	Wow! Richard! Richard drops down to help Alice as she struggles up, dizzily
M	RICHARD	Honey, are you alright--?
M	ALICE	You got my message.
M	RICHARD	I had no idea where you were. I looked all over Paris, but, I What message?
M	ALICE	You went all the way to Paris?
M	RICHARD	A week's an awfully long time.
F	MEG	Longer in France.
M	CLERK	Excusez moi, Mademoiselle Scott?
F	EMMA	Hey, Francois! How are you--? You--? You still need security? Alice and Meg's heads swing in the clerk's direction.
M	CLERK (CONT'D)	You are still robbed?
M	ALICE	No! A misunderstanding. We're fine. She's fine. You're fine, right?
F	EMMA	Super fine.
M	ALICE	Richard, we've got to-- I can't believe you're here--! But, we've got a little situation--
F	EMMA	It'll just take a minute! We'll have her right back!
F	MEG	Don't worry about a thing!
M	RICHARD	Like this? I'll explain everything! I promise! They take off for the elevator.
F	EMMA	Boy! Does he love you. Did you see he fixed my suitcase?
M	CORDELIA (O.S.)	Oh, thank god! Cordelia opens the door to Nikolai, who holds out the room
M	NIKOLAI	Lechu k tebe na krylyah lyubvi.
F	CORDELIA	Security? They look at each other in confusion, Nikolai's smile fading, She slams the door in his face.
F	EMMA	Niki!
M	ALICE	The necklace!
F	MEG	Don't touch that bell! They race down the hall towards Nikolai, who gapes, perplexed
F	EMMA	Oh, Niki! I knew it! I knew it! I believed in you the whole time!
F	CORDELIA	Yes! Police! This is Cordelia Winthrop Scott. In the Grimaldi Suite at the Hotel de Paris. You must come straight away. I've been robbed! And now some horrible, foreign man--! I believe someone is trying to kill me!
F	EMMA	Wait for me in the lobby, sweetie. Down in half a second--
M	NIKOLAI	Ya tebya lyublyu.
F	EMMA	I know. Me, too. The doors close and Emma sprints back down the hall to Alice Okay! Do it! Alice rings the bell.
F	CORDELIA	Yes? Who is it?
F	MEG	Security, Madame.
F	CORDELIA	Finally--! She opens the door. A beat where Cordelia focuses on Alice and Meg first,
M	ALICE	We can explain. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 108.
M	CLERK	Pardon? Is there a problem--?
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	We received a report of an attempted murder in the Grimaldi Suite. Cordelia Scott-- Richard, sitting nearby, looks up at the mention of
M	CLERK	No. No. It is robbery. But, Mademoiselle Scott said it wasn't. Jean-Pierre, checking lists at the ballroom's entrance, notes
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Excuse me. What's--? Mademoiselle Scott has been robbed?
M	CLERK	No. She said, not.
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	She said someone was trying to kill her! We are going up! Richard seems to debate getting involved as the police, the
F	CORDELIA	You can save your "sorrys" for the
F	EMMA	The police--? Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 109.
F	CORDELIA	You robbed me!
M	ALICE	But, the necklace is right here--!
F	CORDELIA	You stole from me--!
F	MEG	We haven't taken anything--
F	EMMA	And, we dry-cleaned the dresses-- Meg and Alice wince, look daggers at Emma. You wore my clothes?
F	EMMA	Well... For the children.
F	CORDELIA	Wha--? What children?
F	MEG	In Africa. This whole thing is for charity. Your necklace is for the auction.
F	CORDELIA	Well, there will certainly be no
F	EMMA	But, that's not fair! It's not the
M	ALICE	Look, you weren't here. Everyone thought she was you-- Thought she was me? Who could possibly believe--?
M	ALICE	They all did. Cordelia looks at Alice a beat as this lands with her.
F	MEG	Every one of them.
F	CORDELIA	But, look at you! Emma takes a step towards her doppelganger, facing off.
F	EMMA	Well, look at you! Common country cows playing dress up. Pretending to be something you're not. Trying to be something that not one of you could ever hope
F	EMMA	You mean miserable? Cordelia blinks. Or a petty, spoiled, selfish-- You--!
F	EMMA	Bitch! Cordelia slaps Emma across the face. Emma raises a hand to cup her cheek as Alice and Meg turn
M	ALICE	You apologize to her right now!
F	CORDELIA	Apologize--?!
M	ALICE	You know, I feel sorry for you--
F	MEG	I don't.
M	ALICE	Because no matter where you go, no matter where you jet to in this world, you are still going to be you. And, let me tell you; she is who you want to be! The all freeze when a BANGING erupts at the door.
M	POLICE CAPTAIN (O.S.)	Mademoiselle Scott? It is the police! Open up! Alice claps a hand over Cordelia's mouth, looks to Meg.
F	EMMA	The police? Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 112.

M	ALICE (O.S.)	Coming! Just a moment, please! The captain grabs the key from the clerk and turns the
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Bon jour. Cordelia, it's the police. Emma turns her head from the mirror she faces.
F	EMMA	Oh, no! This is going to be so embarrassing. Please tell me you didn't run all the way over here just for me.
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	You said there was someone trying to kill you--
M	CLERK	It was a robbery, but, no.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Alice, what's going on?
M	ALICE	A terrible misunderstanding. You see, she couldn't find her necklace. But, you have it? Emma turns, holding the necklace up to her throat.
F	EMMA	Yes, but, Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and help me? I can't seem to manage the clasp. Jean-Pierre senses something amiss, but steps to assist Emma.
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	We heard a scream--
M	ALICE	When she found it--
M	ALICE	She was so happy--
F	EMMA	Relieved! I screamed with delight.
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	And there is no one that wants to Well, I can't speak to that.
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	You said on the phone--

M	POLICE CAPTAIN	And this is the necklace? For the auction? It is. He looks back and forth between Alice and Emma.

M	ALICE	You okay in here? Meg sits on top of Cordelia who is tied to a chair with a
F	MEG	We're great. But, now you can add Well, don't tell her that. Throw me a purse. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 115.

F	EMMA	Niki, I'm sorry. It's just going to another minute.
M	NIKOLAI	Ya sdelayu vsyo, chto smogoo--
F	EMMA	Perfect! That sounds good. Emma is led to the ballroom by the captain as Richard meets
M	ALICE	Richard, this is Jean-Pierre, Jean- Pierre this is Richard, my fiance-- Fiance? Fiance? Jean-Pierre offers his hand to shake, smiling knowingly.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Ahh... A pleasure to meet you. You've come for the auction--?
M	ALICE	Yes! He came all this way! Richard tightens his grip on Jean-Pierre's hand. Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 116.
M	RICHARD	Alice? Who is this guy--? Alice breaks Richard's vice grip with a bright smile.
M	ALICE	I told you, that's Jean-Pierre! He's exhausted! It's such a long trip! Richard flicks his eyes narrowly at Jean-Pierre. I believe we are ready to start. Shall we go in? Alice loops an arm through Richard's to follow Jean-Pierre,
M	RICHARD	Is there something I need to know? Alice looks at Richard, reading his face, and smiles.
M	ALICE	No. There's isn't. She leads Richard through the ballroom entrance only to be
M	ATTENDANT	Pardon, Monsieur, invitation--?
M	ALICE	He's with me! As Alice pulls Richard through to the ballroom, Nikolai steps
M	ATTENDANT	Oh! Monsieur Ludovic! Welcome! As Nikolai is ushered into the auction with great fanfare, Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 117.
F	CORDELIA	You will never get away with this.
F	MEG	Believe me, nothing would make me happier than having a little talk with your father-- Both their heads swing toward the door when the bell RINGS!
F	MEG	Bernard...? He holds out the bottle of wine.
M	BERNARD	We forgot your prize.
F	MEG	Oh, I... She glances back into the room behind her, carefully
M	BERNARD	I have come at a bad time?
F	MEG	No. No, Bernard, that's not it.
F	MEG	I'd invite you in, but-- Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 118.

M	JEAN-PIERRE	Yes ! No. Nikolai smiles up at Emma as ANOTHER GUEST raises a Champagne
M	DOMENICO	Five hundred, five hundred fifty thousand!
M	BERNARD	But, Meg! Why do we run? Meg stops on a landing, turns.
F	MEG	Bernard, you should stop. You really don't need this. I may be going away for a long time--
M	BERNARD	To America?
F	MEG	Something like that. Look, this is where we should say "au revoir." Bernard smiles and pulls Meg to him, kisses her.
M	BERNARD	But, I must see how this ends! 0 He grabs her hand and they plunge down the stairs together.
M	NIKOLAI	Eight hundred! The crowd applauds happily.
F	EMMA	Niki. What are you doing?
M	NIKOLAI	Vsyo, chto ya de-la-yu, lish dlya.

M	ALICE	He means no harm--
M	JEAN-PIERRE	Alice. Lithuania?
M	ALICE	Yes? He owns it. Alice blinks.

M	PENELOPE	Wait! Penelope steps up onto the platform, shielding Emma and Alice
M	PENELOPE (CONT'D)	These are not imposters! These are my friends!
F	CORDELIA	Penelope Pignose?!
M	PENELOPE	And, you were never anyone's friend. Alice takes in the escalating situation, steps bravely
M	ALICE	It's true! A ripple of exclamation sweeps the dumbfounded crowd.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	We're not who we said we were. We're... We're only high school teachers. From Racine, Wisconsin.
M	CORBEL IA	There! You see?
M	ALICE	We'd never been anywhere. And we took a trip, that didn't belong to us... Because, well, because you thought we were... important. And that she was Cordelia... Richard smiles at Alice, supporting her with his gaze.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	We wanted to help. We never meant to mislead anyone-- Or hurt anyone--
M	ALICE	We're very sorry. And, we're willing to face the consequences, whatever they are... But... She turns to Meg and Emma as a smile blossoms.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	But, this was our adventure.
F	MEG	And it was an excellent one.
M	ALICE	We wouldn't change a minute of it.
F	EMMA	Not for anything in the world. Richard takes the pulse of the frighteningly still crowd, the,
M	RICHARD	one million five hundred thousand! The crowd gasps and Alice gapes at Richard.
M	RICHARD (CONT'D)	Why not go big?
M	PENELOPE	One million six hundred thousand!
F	EMMA	Penny, you don't have to...
M	PENELOPE	Friends. Right?
M	DOMENICO	Excellent! We have a bid for one million six hundred thousand! Cordelia whirls to the police captain amidst applause.
F	CORDELIA	Why are you just standing there?! Arrest them!
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	Arrest them? For what? They seem very nice.
M	DOMENICO	One million six hundred thousand! Do I have another bid?
F	CORDELIA	They confessed! They're imposters! They stole my necklace!
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	That necklace? But, it is here, no?
F	CORDELIA	They kidnapped me!
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	And yet you are here. I see no problem. Everyone is very happy--
F	CORDELIA	Excuse me, but, I'm not happy!
M	POLICE CAPTAIN	Ah, but, this... I can do nothing about.
M	NIKOLAI	Three million! The crowd erupts, giddy, their applause escalating.
M	DOMENICO	Three million Euros!
F	EMMA	Nikolai! No...
M	ALICE	Emma. It's okay.
F	EMMA	How? How can it be okay?
M	ALICE	He's rich. SOLD! To Monsieur Nikolai Ludovic! For three million Euros! The crowd cheers, overwhelming a forgotten Cordelia as it
M	ALICE	Richard...
M	ALICE	Take me home?
M	RICHARD	Anywhere you want, Alice. We'll go anywhere you want. They kiss as Meg finds Bernard who shakes his head with a
F	MEG	Oh, good. I could use a drink.
M	BERNARD	First prize. To the champion. Nikolai takes Emma's hands in his up on stage.
F	EMMA	Niki? What's going on?
M	NIKOLAI	Ya das-ta-nu to-be zvyoz-dee. Emma nods, without any real understanding, as he indicates
M	NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Is my gift. For you. Emma's eyes slowly come into focus as it all becomes They stand, with Richard, Bernard, Nikolai, Penelope and
M	ALICE	This is for our room. And the trip down.
F	MEG	The rest is for the schools. Jean-Pierre hesitates in accepting the envelope, but Alice
M	ALICE	Please.
M	JEAN-PIERRE	You are all extraordinary women. I wish you much happiness. Thank you. Meg turns to Bernard, holding up the bottle of wine, as
F	MEG	You come to Wisconsin, we'll drink this in my kitchen.
M	BERNARD	Yes. They embrace and Meg turns with Alice to Emma who stands arm
M	ALICE	Now, Emma, you're sure about this?
F	EMMA	I'll call you both as soon as I know. They may have to get a sub at school for a couple of weeks, but, oh, you guys, I swear it sounded like a proposal! Alice and Meg turn to Nikolai who grins and nods away.
M	NIKOLAI	Yes! Yes! Emma and Nikolai shake hands with Bernard, then turn and head
F	CORDELIA	Yes, Daddy! It was a huge success-- She stops suddenly, as if struck, and her expression of Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 12 8. Thank you? You're, you're welcome. One of the paparazzi raises his camera to take her picture,
M	PAPARAZZI	That's not her. That's the other one. A small smile finds its way onto Alice's face and she gently
M	ALICE (V.0.)	"I used to wander aimlessly,/ Wanton my goal, grievous my plight./Your dear hands led me, guided me." Alice encircles Richard's waist as they walk, and he slings Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 129. "Over the far horizon, night/ Glowed with the pallid hope of dawn./Your eyes' glance was my morning light." A YOUNG GIRL presents a length of brightly woven fabric,
M	ALICE (V.0.)	"No sound - save his own tread upon/The ground - to ease the wanderer's heart./Your voice encouraged me: 'go on!"' A STUDENT carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon,
M	ALICE	"Yes, my heart - dark, cowed, set apart,/Alone - bewailed its dire distress./Sweet love, with its all- conquering art." The entire classroom hangs on her every word.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	"Joined us as one in joyousness." A beat as she and her class float on the last phrase of Paul Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 13 0. Mademoiselle Perry, what was it really like? Alice refocuses to smile at Amber and survey all the faces of
M	ALICE	Everyone should go. At least once in their life. There's a whole world for you to see.
