M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)	Doug?... We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)	Doug? Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY
F	KELLY	I've got some stuff to do for the party tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school?
M	DOUG	What "stuff"? This party isn't going to be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a
F	KELLY	It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its going to be a nice party with nice food and nice music. And wings have carbs, so you can't eat them anyway. I'll eat 'em. Doug gives Billy a look.
M	DOUG	No you won't. Because I'm going to scrape the batter off.
M	BILLY	That doesn't work.
M	DOUG	I went to medical school. You think I don't know how carbs work?
M	BILLY	Dentists go to medical school? Doug looks a little insulted.
F	KELLY	Doug, can you take Billy or not?
M	DOUG	Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any emergencies at the office this morning.
F	KELLY	You have emergencies? Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my pager is for. one beep from that thing, and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah. Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up. The battery ith gone in that thing. You took them out for the TV clicker. Doug gives Billy a look.
M	DOUG	I did do that. I forgot about that. I need to get some batteries in there. Because dentists do have emergencies. We are doctors, you know? We take the same oath. The oath of saving lives. Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms. Uh uh. Carbth. Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the
M	DOUG	You know, I use to race a car like this. Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw me coming.
M	BILLY	Really?
M	DOUG	Yup. It could really... smoke some ass.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Yes, sir. They called it the dragon wagon. You're lucky to be in here without a helmet, pal. We both are. Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars
M	BILLY	Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio?
M	DOUG	Heck yeah, you can jam the radio. Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.
M	VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE	Bob?... BOB LEVENSTEIN, 40s, is working at his computer. Bob is
M	VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE (CONT'D)	Bob!? Bob cringes at the shrill, female voice.
M	BOB	Hey, honey.
M	VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE	You need to come tell Haley she can't go to a party tonight.
M	BOB	Well, I'm technically at the office right now, so... The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN,
F	KAREN	Are you kidding me!? You work in our guest bedroom, not an office.
M	BOB	I know, I was just trying to make this
F	KAREN	Yeah, and I have to go to a job that actually makes us money, Bob. So, get out here and tell Haley she's not going anywhere! Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 5.
F	CLAIRE	Hey, Daddy. Listen. Bob winces, and looks around for his other daughter.
M	SFX: PHONE RINGS	Bob reaches for it, but his other teenage daughter,
F	HALEY	No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien! Haley snatches the phone away from Bob.
M	BOB	Actually, I need to talk to you-- Hey, Julien. Yeah, totally. I'll probably just drop by and chill.
M	BOB	If that's about the party, you--
F	HALEY	Dad! I'm talking, here. God! Haley storms out of the room. Bob goes to say something, Eeeeeeeiiiiiaaaaa!! Bob just stares at her, as Karen enters the Kitchen.
F	KAREN	Did you talk to her? Tell me you talked to her. God! I have to do everything! Just get Claire to ballet. She's late.
M	BOB	Well, I really have to finish my-- Your little article for the "Web" magazine, Bob?
M	KAREN (CONT'D)	I have a shareholder meeting. And we agreed that my career would be the priority, and you would work out of the house. You might not like it, but my job is higher paying. And I don't see you complaining about that hundred dollar shirt you're wearing. Bob looks down at his too-hip dress shirt.
M	BOB	You bought this shirt for me. I was fine with my t-shirts--
F	KAREN	Oh, you don't like the shirt now? Fine. Take it off.
M	BOB	What?
F	KAREN	Take it off! You don't want to wear nice things, don't. Off! Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it
M	KAREN (CONT'D)	Now take Claire to her ballet class. It's starts in five minutes.
M	BOB	Well, I have to get another--
F	KAREN	Go! Five minutes! Karen pushes Bob out the door, with Claire skipping
M	BOB	You going to wear that?
F	CLAIRE	For five dollars, I'm not. Bob sighs and reaches for his wallet.
M	MALE VOICE (O.C.)	Woody. Woody Stevens! We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes
M	WOODY	.No, you listen to me. You're not going to push me around. We agreed on a price, and that's the price I'll pay. If you don't like it, walk away... but you can kiss your business good bye, because that's what happens when you screw with Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard. As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Money's never a problem. You just need to honor the correct price. Got it? Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset
M	WOODY	.Then go home, Toby! You make me sick!
M	TOBY	I can't do this many leaves for ten bucks! It'll take two hours!
M	WOODY	Well, you should have thought of that before you put the "any yard for ten bucks" flyer on the telephone pole. You're done on this block, now. And that goes for your band fund-raisers, too. I'm not buying any candy bars no matter what parade you dorks have to get to! Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Dudley?
M	DUDLEY	Yeah, hey, Mac. How's it go--
M	COMPUTER VOICE	It is now nine o'clock am.
M	DUDLEY	Thanks, Mac. Open internet, okay? A pause.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Command unknown.
M	DUDLEY	Mac. Open. Internet. A pause.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	It is now nine o'clock am.
M	DUDLEY	Alright, Mac. I'll show you. Dudley clicks a few keys and nods satisfactorily.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Internet open. Dudley laughs good-naturedly.
M	DUDLEY	Right, because I just opened it. I guess I need to research alternative specs.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Searching "alternative sex."
M	DUDLEY	What? No! Dudley jumps forward and starts hitting the keys.
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Two million websites found.
M	DUDLEY	I didn't want to search that! I said specs... "all the data to be compiled."
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Searching "sex all the day with child."
M	DUDLEY	Ahhh, No!! "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 10. Looks like it's still just you and me, icat. Dudley reaches out to pet the cat. It hisses at him
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	Sorry. Hey, honey. INTERCUT WITH KELLY: On the phone at home.
F	KELLY	You busy?
M	DOUG	Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right here in front of me. Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic
F	KELLY	Don't they mind you being on the phone?
M	DOUG	Well, it's not attached to a head, really. More research. Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out.
F	KELLY	Oh. Well, I just wanted to tell you I found a great rate for the Ritz-Carlton tomorrow night. I Thought it might be romantic. Mom can stay here with Billy.
M	DOUG	I don't know. Do you think we really need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy has his own room. Why don't we just buy new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones. It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have to pay to make phone calls!
M	DOUG	What? I'm just saying-- Suddenly, the speaker comes on overhead.
M	VOICE ON SPEAKER	Dr. Matthews? Patient emergency in room eight. Doug snaps to attention.
M	DOUG	Emergency? I've got to go! Emergency! Doug jumps out of his seat and scrambles over his desk
F	DANA	Doctor Matthews. Finally. Take a look at this. Doug looks in the man's mouth and nods.
M	DOUG	Acute molar abscess. That's going to need emergency surgery.
F	DANA	That's what I thought. Thank God you got here.
M	DOUG	Yeah. Well, let's send him over to an Orthopedic surgeon.
F	DANA	Absolutely. Thanks, doctor. Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but Yo! Matthews is open. Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the Taking it into the paint. Who's got the D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya! Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Well, that's not really my shot. I usually hit from downtown, you know? Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	That's where the big games get won. Back here from the three-- Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	That was a pass, dudes! It wasn't. Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there
F	KELLY	Hey, honey. Snack? Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over
M	DOUG	I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go meet the guys for a beer. Okay. Lite beer, if you want to stick to that diet. delicious beer... water. Doug smiles and heads upstairs. Kelly looks concerned. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 15. A MINUTE LATER, Woody pulls onto the street on his Dudley cockily pulls on a "Wild Hogs" jacket, kick starts
M	DUDLEY	Thanks, Woody. I feel really safe with you.
M	WOODY	I noticed that. And if you ever lay your head on my back when you're riding bitch again, I'm going to throw you into traffic.
M	DUDLEY	I was trying to keep my face out of the wind.
M	WOODY	I felt you smell my hair!
M	DOUG	Guys! Come on. Let's go get a brew. I'm buying. Doug heads into the bar.
M	BOB	You're cool with the carbs? Doug pauses, without turning around. I can have a light. Doug continues into the bar, but now with less swagger.
M	WOODY	Man, I wish we could find a place that wasn't so freaking lame.
M	BOB	What are you talking about? This place is cool. We're with other bikers. Wild Hogs aren't welcome here! The guys all look at him for a beat - then the Bald guy
M	DOUG	Hey, Paul. PAUL laughs at his joke.
M	PAUL	Hey, guys... Woody, your tax return is almost done, but I want to talk to you next week about incorporating. A lot of my executive clients have been--
M	WOODY	Yeah, Paul. I'll talk to you about it on the trip.
M	PAUL	Yeah, we'll talk about in Daytona. What the hell are you staring at!? Paul glares at the other guys for a beat, then cracks up. See you guys. Paul exits. Woody shakes his head.
M	WOODY	This place sucks. Why are we going to Daytona with these posers?
M	DOUG	Because it's Bike Week. That's our annual trip, Woody. We're Wild Hogs.
M	WOODY	We're not Wild Hogs. That's a patch your wife made and we all had to sew it on our jackets so she didn't feel bad.
M	DOUG	Hey! She took an embroidery class for those. What has your wife ever made us? Hard.
M	WOODY	Hey!?
M	BOB	Sorry. I didn't... Don't tell her.
M	DOUG	It's not a big secret, Bob. She's a swimsuit model. She's hot. I mean, so is my Kelly. She's very hot. Even after ten years. Not that I'm not still good looking... Doug looks at the guys. They don't respond.
M	WOODY	We're not going to say you're hot, man.
M	DOUG	Because it's gay, or because I'm not?
M	WOODY	There's no non-gay response to that. If I were a girl, I'd be attracted to you.
M	WOODY	Point proven.
M	BOB	Well, Kelly must still think you're hot. Ten years, man. How's that feel?
M	DOUG	I don't know. Good, I guess. Is ten the silver anniversary?
M	DUDLEY	No, that's the 25th. Ten is aluminum.
M	DOUG	Aluminum? Like, siding? Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum is sturdy, lightweight... recycled.
M	WOODY	--And ready for the trip of a lifetime.
M	DOUG	We don't need a map for Daytona. We just follow the group. Woody takes a drink from his beer, then looks at the
M	WOODY	Not if we don't go on the Daytona trip.
M	DOUG	What?
M	DUDLEY	Noooo!!
M	WOODY	Guys, listen to me. It's time for a change. Let's go on our own trip this year. Just us, like it was in college. Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach. Bike Week is just corporate white guys playing dress up. This bar is, too. And we didn't get into this to play dress up - we got in this to live. "Be cool and Ride free." That's the Wild Hog creed.
M	DOUG	No, it's not. It's the slogan for the Downtown trolley.
M	WOODY	I know. But, it works as our creed, too. So let's live it!
M	DUDLEY	But, I boogie board in Daytona. Can't our creed be "Be cool and boogie board?"
M	WOODY	No. That's dumb, Dudley. Let the big people talk.
M	DOUG	Well, what kind of trip are you suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?
M	WOODY	No. That's the best part. We don't do some planned out trip. We follow the open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of America. We take a week and go all the way to San Francisco. Think about it, guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we want, whenever we want... Just freedom. When was the last time we had that? The guys consider this, but look sceptical.
M	BOB	I don't know, man.
M	WOODY	You're afraid to ask your wife. No... What do you think?
M	DOUG	Well, Daytona isn't the "backbone of America," but it is a tradition. We've been riding with this club for years. Do we really want to miss out on that?
M	KENT	Hey, dudes. Check these out. Kent holds up a sleeveless t-shirt with a big cartoon guy
M	KENT (CONT'D)	We're all going to wear these on the trip. That way everyone will know we're from the Cincinnati chapter. It'll also get you ten percent off at T.G.I.Fridays.
M	DUDLEY	Cool! Born to be wild! Dudley grabs a shirt and starts to pull it over the t-
M	DOUG	Look, We'll talk about it tomorrow. But we don't need some trip to go "live." We Free and wild. Doug looks around the party. Several middle-aged couples Kelly walks up and kisses him on the cheek. Yeah. It's getting pretty late, though.
F	KELLY	It's eight O'Clock. It started at seven.
M	DOUG	oh. Still, that's late. We should just flicker the lights on and off. People will get it. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 22.
F	KELLY	People are having fun. Look at the Miltons. ANGLE ON: THE LIVING ROOM. A happy-looking couple, THE
M	DOUG	Oh, man. There should be laws against that... Is Fred having a seizure?
F	KELLY	No, Fred's having a good time. With his wife. Remember what that was like?
M	DOUG	Hey, we have fun all the time. But I'm not going to let myself look like that. He wears dress socks with shorts, too. I've seen it. Do you want me to do that?
F	KELLY	I don't care. Why do you? Doug searches for a response, as ROGER, 70, Kelly's Dad,
M	ROGER	Excuse me, everybody. I have a little toast. For my daughter and her husband.
M	DOUG	He's drunk. We should do something.
M	ROGER	I want to start by saying how proud I am of my son-in-law.
M	DOUG	--No, he's fine. Let him talk.
M	ROGER	Now, I have to make an admission. Ten years ago, when Doug and Kelly got married. I was worried. Doug was a little wild... The guests laugh. Doug gives an unsure chuckle.
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	I mean, he had that old trans-am with the huge engine... Remember how he'd peel out of anywhere? Even the grocery parking lot after buying baby formula?
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	Or the way he'd just grab Kelly and run off to some crazy island to snorkel with something that thinks you're lunch.
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	But, not anymore. He's now become the son-in-law I would have always hoped for. Responsible, reliable, and a great husband to my daughter. So cheers to--
M	DOUG	No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't an accurate toast. I'm still the same, shitty son-in-law I used to be. Come on, Doug. You should be proud!
M	DOUG	Grown up? No, I haven't. I'm still Doug, stop it. You're being rude. Well, tell them I'm the same as I used to
F	KELLY	You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for dancing, because he would have been out there dancing himself. With me.
M	DOUG	So what are you saying?
F	KELLY	I'm saying you have changed. And frankly, i don't like it. I like you the way you were. I liked it when you weren't afraid of looking stupid. I liked it when we laughed. I liked it when we danced.
M	DOUG	Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is lame. People like me need a fresh beat!
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't 1980 anymore, man. Yeah! I take you to the... Andy shop-- Doug tries to confidently sing along, but struggles
F	KELLY	Honey, stop it. You're being an ass.
M	DOUG	What!? I thought this was what you wanted? I'm dancing! Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Come on, baby! Just because we're married ten years doesn't mea n we're old people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood! Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Nope, that feels bad--
F	KELLY	Doug? What's wrong? Are you okay?
M	DOUG	Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I should go to the hospital-- Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help
F	KELLY	Doug!?
M	DOCTOR	Well, Mr. Matthews--
M	DOUG	Dr. Matthews, actually.
M	DOCTOR	Oh, really? Great. Then, I can say this a lot easier. You had a hypertensive myocardial seizure. Doug nods confidently, then, after a moment: I'm a dentist, actually... I have no idea what you just said.
M	DOCTOR	Oh. Sorry. It looks like you had a stress-induced panic attack.
M	DOUG	Stress-induced? I'm not stressed.
M	DOCTOR	Well, it's probably been pretty buried. I actually see it a lot with middle-aged men. Work, family, it can take a toll on you.
M	DOUG	I'm not middle-aged.
M	DOCTOR	Yeah, I see that a lot, too. Anyway. We should have you out of here soon. The doctor smiles and exits the room. Kelly looks at
M	DOUG	I am middle aged, aren't I?
F	KELLY	Only mathematically. Doug takes this in.
M	KELLY (CONT'D)	Doug, Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi song?
M	DOUG	What?
F	KELLY	You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the top of your lungs. Like you didn't care who heard you, or how dopey it sounded. sense of humor, the way you used to give me that cocky little wink when you took
M	DOUG	I don't know. There's just a lot weighing me down these days, you know?
F	KELLY	Like what? You have a great career, a
M	TIRED OF--	Doug stops himself, as it dawns on him. You can see the It's me. I'm weighing me down. I'm not a guy I'd hang out with anymore, I'm... Me. What's cool about me? I don't even eat carbs.
F	KELLY	Then eat them. I'd rather have you sing than have a thirty-four waist.
M	DOUG	I still have a thirty--
F	KELLY	No, you don't, Doug. I buy your pants. Look. We've been married ten years. And personally, I'd like to be married fifty more, but if you stay like this... Then... I don't know...
M	DOUG	We are going to be married fifty more years, Kelly. I'm going to find old Doug. I just have to figure out where to look. Kelly takes a breath, and pulls out a map. She hands it
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Woody's map?
F	KELLY	I took it away from him at the party. He wouldn't stop waving it at Bob and Dudley.
M	DOUG	I thought you agreed it was a bad idea.
F	KELLY	It might be. But I'm desperate, Doug. I want us to be happy again. So go on it. It's my anniversary present to you.
M	DOUG	Really? I only got you an ankle bracelet.
F	KELLY	All I want is old Doug back. Please. This marriage can't survive without him. Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good
M	BOB	Doug! Are you okay?
M	DOUG	Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress.
M	BOB	Oh, man. Thank god. Where's Karen?
M	BOB	Oh, she's waiting in the parking-- SFX: A loud honk from the parking lot.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	That's her. Bob looks out the window nervously. Kelly looks at Doug.
F	KELLY	You all need this trip. Doug gives her a knowing nod, then turns to Bob.
M	DOUG	Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike week. Let's ride across U.S. 50.
M	BOB	Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, We'll be leaving behind everything we're used to.
M	KAREN (O.C.)	Bob!? You said two minutes! I'm not circling!! Bob cringes. Doug shares a look with Kelly, then to Bob:
M	DOUG	Yeah. I think that might be okay. What? What's wrong with you?
M	DUDLEY	I got a tat.
M	BOB	A tattoo? You got a tattoo?
M	DUDLEY	I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat! Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he
M	DOUG	Wow. That's...
M	DUDLEY	Trademarked, I know. But what are they going to do? It's in my skin, bitch!
M	DOUG	You're not wearing a helmet?
M	WOODY	Nape. I don't want anything between me and the road, man.
M	DOUG	You will if your head falls on it.
M	WOODY	Look, the only rule on this trip is to have no plan. We're riding to San Francisco, and nothing else is planned. Just riding free.
M	DOUG	Well, if we're going to make it in five days, we'll should probably get to Illinois by tonight.
M	BOB	Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should be a hundred miles past St. Louis by sundown.
M	WOODY	What? No. No plan. It's the open road. Who knows where we'll be.
M	DOUG	I do. I have this little GPS system. Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Hey! What the hell, man? That was expensive!
M	WOODY	I did it for the good of the trip, Doug. You don't need GPS to discover America. We just need the wind, our bikes, and freedom. And if we have an emergency, I always have a cell phone-- Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it
M	DOUG	Hah! How's that feel? Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.
M	WOODY	It felt good. It felt damn good. No cell phones! What?
M	BOB	He's right, Doug. Wild Hogs! Bob takes his cellphone and throws it in the storm drain. You just did that so Karen wouldn't call.
M	BOB	Yup. Bob starts his bike.
M	DOUG	So we're not even going to talk about this? I mean, shouldn't we at least--
M	DUDLEY	Yeeeeaaah! Freedom!! Dudley throws his cellphone, but instead of going into Okay, let's ride! The guys all hastily start their bikes and take off up
M	SFX: THUNDER CRACK	The guys look up at the sky apprehensively. Why didn't you just bring a sleeping bag like us?
M	BOB	This is more comfortable. I wish Karen would have let me buy the foot pump, though.
M	DUDLEY	This is poop. Don't eat it. Dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire.
M	DOUG	Dudley? You're supposed to bury that.
M	WOODY	Yes. Go bury it.
M	DUDLEY	It's in a plastic bag. I can't put that in the earth. I'll find a trash bin tomorrow. The guys shake their heads and look back into the fire.
M	DOUG	This is really nice, you know? Chilling by the fire with your best friends. Just relaxing, and enjoying-- I'm sorry. Dudley, you have to get rid of that bag or I'm going to vomit in your lap.
M	DOUG	--each other's company... Dudley grabs the bag and heads off.
M	DUDLEY	Fine. I'll just hang it on a tree.
M	WOODY	Don't hang it on a tree!
M	DOUG	Yup... These are the times we'll remember. After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Hey, when was the last time you guys heard me sing Bon Jovi?
M	WOODY	Oh, man. Thank God that stopped.
M	BOB	It's been awhile. You're not as obnoxious as you used to be. You used to eat a lot more buffalo wings, too.
M	DOUG	Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe carbs are what I need to get old Doug back.
M	WOODY	Old Doug? You've lost your Dad?
M	DOUG	No. I think I've lost me. It's this thing Kelly said. You know what it is? I think I'm tame. I'm like a lion that used to be wild, but now I'm in some Disney park where tourists come by and take pictures of me like I'm a lion, but after they leave, I go into my kennel and eat antelope nuggets or something. Ones without carbs.
M	BOB	I know what you're talking about. I lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and daughters killed him. I'm surrounded by women every minute of my life. And it's made me, you know...
M	DOUG	A wimp?
M	BOB	What? No. I was going to say miserable. You think I'm a wimp?
M	DOUG	No. I just thought that was what you were... I thought you wanted us to guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I said "wimp." Knowing it was wrong...
M	WOODY	You're a wimp, Bob. I'll say it. You're afraid of girls. It's embarrassing. Dudley comes up and sits back down.
M	DUDLEY	I'm afraid of girls.
M	WOODY	You're afraid to talk to one. Bob is afraid they'll kill him in his sleep.
M	DUDLEY	Wow. Now I really don't want to talk to one.
M	BOB	You know, it's not always so bad. Like, when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over and pushes up against me. Just snuggles right up like she needs me. I like that. I like that a lot. Then the sun comes up and turns her into
M	DOUG	Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple as it was when we were in college. Well, except for you, Woody. You're still living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model wife. Big job at an investment firm. You've got the good life. Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the Yeah... The good life. I'm a lucky man.
M	DUDLEY	My life blows. I don't have a family. Or a wife. I have a cat that doesn't like me. She wouldn't even stick around if she knew how to use a can opener. The guys all look at Dudley.
M	BOB	Hey, Dudley. You've got us, buddy. And you're going to get a woman, too. I told you we were going to hit some strip clubs when we get back.
M	DUDLEY	Nah, I don't like those places--
M	BOB	Dudley-- Please. I'm trying to help you here.
M	DUDLEY	I know. I just don't--
M	BOB	Please! Strippers are nice to me!
M	DUDLEY	Okay... Sorry. We'll go.
M	BOB	Thanks, man. I'm just... trying to be a good friend.
M	DOUG	We know, Bob.
M	WOODY	I'll go, too.
M	DOUG	There's a surprise. Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	All right, who wants their marshmallow well-done? The guys just look at it.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Yeah, I left that one on too long. Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying
M	BOB	I think I'm half way there.
M	WOODY	In just one hour. You sure you don't want us to spread out a sleeping bag? We have three in the-- Doug turns around and sees a foot-wide flame now burning
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Shit! The tent-- Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Dudley, get the water jug off my bike!
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	It should be okay. It's fire retardant. The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes Dudley, no! That's It's too late. Dudley is already throwing it on the
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley! Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly
M	DUDLEY	We need more water.
M	DOUG	That was all of it, Dudley. That was all the water we had.
M	DUDLEY	Oh. Dudley takes this in for a moment.
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	Is anybody else thirsty? The guys just look at him.
M	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	You guys all right?
M	DOUG	Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.
M	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	All right. Just making sure. Looks pretty comfortable, actually. We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his
M	DOUG	Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have a nice day, officer. The highway patrolman laughs.
M	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	All right, I get it. Five's a crowd. Doug is mortified. The officer looks them over for a
M	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT'D)	You guys are lucky to have each other. Damn lucky. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 39. That's what I always say. Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug. We see he's
M	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	Well... Have a good one. The patrolman walks off. Dudley looks at Doug and grins.
M	DUDLEY	Morning.
M	DOUG	Please put your pants on.
M	BOB	Thanks for waiting for me, jerks. The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold: He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	What?
M	WOODY	Why are you naked?
M	BOB	We're swimming. You guys kept on your skivies?
M	DOUG	Skivies? What are you, a Newsie?
M	DUDLEY	I kept mine on because I didn't want everyone to see my crank. Yeah. That, and being naked with a bunch of guys is gay. What's wrong with you?
M	BOB	I don't know. We took showers and stuff together in college. I thought this was kind of... you know, the same.
M	DOUG	I guess I get that. I mean, we would have been naked in college. Why are we... Oh, man. It's true. We are tamed. We're old guys.
M	WOODY	No, we're not. Don't say that. Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air.
M	DOUG	I will find old Doug! Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley
M	DUDLEY	I will... Do what Doug does! Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at
M	WOODY	I will be naked with my gay friends, and if they look at my jock, I will kill them. Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with
M	FAMILY DAD	Hope you guys don't mind a little company. The mini-van was getting a The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He
M	DOUG	Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I
M	WOODY	There's a shallower spring up the path. The kids might like that even more... The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The Oh, no. These little squirts like to
M	DIVE AND--	The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water, Janey, Kyle, Holland. Out of the water. We're going to find a new spot.
M	JANEY	No, Mama. This place has little rocks
M	FAMILY MOM	Get out of the damn water! Now! The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off
M	DOUG	We should go.
M	BOB	You think? They're gone, now.
M	WOODY	Yeah, we could stay another few-- Whhheeeeew! The guys look to the other side of the spring to see the
M	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	Saw you're bikes out there. You guys ever chicken fight? The guys look at each other for a moment, then;
M	DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY	Ahhhh! / Oh, god! / Run! They frantically sprint out of the water, grab their On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are
M	BOB	Dammit! Leg's asleep. The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike
M	DUDLEY	Me, too.
M	DOUG	You guys have to shift every once in awhile. Blood has to circulate. A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their
M	WOODY	Now this is the best part of any road trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels. Look at this place. America! The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack
M	DOUG	Look at these bikes. They're all classics.
M	BOB	Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead. You know how rare this thing is? The guys all crowd around the bike.
M	DOUG	Yeah, but why didn't he customize it? You have a 51 panhead and you don't chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.
M	WOODY	Probably no good custom stores out here in hick-land. We'll leave 'em a catalog. How's it going?
M	BOB	Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends. I'm surprised we've never seen you in Daytona. The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of
M	JACK	Yeah, how do we keep missing that? The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though
M	JACK (CONT'D)	So you re "Wild Hogs," huh? That's your gang?
M	DOUG	Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends that ride... you know.
M	JACK	So it's like a little hobby for you guys? How sweet. Doug smiles, but is now sensing the hostility. He looks Yeah, just a little hobby for us.
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	We're all successful professionals in real life. But on Tuesday and Sunday afternoons... We're bikers! Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his
M	JACK	Wow. That's great. Can I try that on?
M	DUDLEY	Hell yeah, brother. Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	So who's '51 panhead is that? Sweet ride. Woody has a catalog so you can make it cool.
M	WOODY	No, I don't. Doug does. I think it's great the way it is. Doug glares at Woody incredulously. Woody shrugs. Well, if you like my '51, we should trade... "brother." I wish! I just have a Sportster. It's worth, like, half of yours.
M	JACK	A Sportster!? That's what I grew up on. I've been wanting another Sportster. It's a deal!
M	DUDLEY	Seriously? You're serious!?
M	DOUG	Dudley, maybe you should--
M	DUDLEY	Doug, don't worry. Yeah, I'll have a cooler bike than you, but that doesn't mean I'll get all cocky.
M	DUDLEY	Hey, I don't care what you say! I ride a panhead now! I'm better than you!
M	JACK	Come on, Dud. Let's go see how you look on it. Jack smiles and leads Dudley outside. Doug, Bob and
M	WOODY	Anybody else got that "pre-rape" feeling?
M	JACK	Oh, no, no. That's Oilcan's ride. My ' 51 panhead is right over there. Jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles.
M	DUDLEY	That? That's a piece of junk.
M	JACK	Yup. Your piece of junk. Woody, Doug and Bob look at each other. This isn't good.
M	DOUG	All right, guys. We get the joke... Good one. Anyway, we actually should get moving along. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 47.
M	JACK	Oh, it's no joke. You want to know the joke? Suburban assholes that buy leather outfits and think they're bikers. And it's a joke I'm damn sick of. So I'm keeping your friend's bike, I'm keeping this jacket, and you guys are going to turn the hell around and go back to wherever you came from, because the next hundred miles of this highway belongs to the Hells Angels. The color drains from the Wild Hog's faces.
M	DUDLEY	Like an adopt a highway thing?
M	JACK	Like a "Go home or we're going to split your skulls open" thing. Bob makes an audible whimper. Doug elbows him, and tries
M	DOUG	All right. We respect that this is your turf, and we're sorry for bothering you. But we can't head back without my friend's bike. So clearly we're going to have to work something out here. Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods.
M	JACK	You're right. We're going to have to work something out. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 48.
M	WOODY	All right. Let's just give them a few minutes to get back inside - then shoot right past them.
M	BOB	What? Are you nuts?
M	DOUG	The trip's over, Woody. Let's just head back home.
M	WOODY	We're going to turn back after all these miles? Just because some fat bully's pushed us around?
M	DOUG BOB	Yes. Yes. Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley.
M	DUDLEY	I go wherever you go.
M	WOODY	Good. See? Dudley's got some balls.
M	DUDLEY	No, my sidecar's just attached to your bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I could only roll so far...
M	WOODY	I can't believe you guys. What a bunch of pussies. The whole point of this trip is to live, man.
M	DOUG	That's the point, Woody. Our lives aren't on this highway. They're back home. We have families, jobs, wives... or cats... We're not going to piss off a biker gang. We're going back. Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Come on, Woody. You don't want to take this risk. You have Claudia, and your job... You have a great life back home.
M	WOODY	You're right, I do. But maybe I should talk to those guys one more time. I mean, I'm an executive at an Investment firm. I've made a career out of convincing people and these are just people. You guys wait here. Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each
M	DUDLEY	I'll wait here, too. You'll get better gas mileage. Dudley gets out and falls to the ground. Leg's asleep. Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar. Come after us now, assholes. Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird
M	WOODY	They're cool with it. We can press on.
M	BOB	Seriously?
M	WOODY	Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to reason. I told them Dudley was dying.
M	DUDLEY	What?
M	WOODY	Well, technically we're all dying, Dudley. Just very slowly. Dudley looks concerned.
M	DUDLEY	Oh my god, you're right. I'm slowly dying.
M	WOODY	Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid it out for them. I said, "Hey, go ahead and assault us. Because we might be not be real bikers, but we know real lawyers. And the moment you touch us is the moment you get your ass sued. Because this is the real world - with real laws, and real consequences." And they backed down. The guys are impressed.
M	DOUG	You really said that?
M	WOODY	Yup. And I think they'll give us Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's go. Quick. Before they change their mind. Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.
M	OILCAN	Ow! Shit, man! Jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away.
M	JACK	Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen.
M	OILCAN	Try and watch the throws, okay Jack? Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into
M	OILCAN (CONT'D)	Owww! Jesus! Sorry.
M	JACK	What the f-- You've gotta be kidding me. Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and
M	JACK (CONT'D)	shit. The flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a
M	WOODY	No, we're not stopping here. Riding at night is half the fun. Let's just keep--
M	DOUG	--I can't feel my nuts, Woody. And Kelly still wants another kid. DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY head inside the motel office.
M	WOODY	So, adopt a kid. You already have two white ones, anyway. The guys ignore him. Woody looks back down the highway
M	OILCAN	I got my old lady bringing some gas. We can get moving by nightfall. Forget it. Those guys are long gone.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	They're not stupid enough to stop until they're five hundred miles from here. I just think it's just stupid to stop this soon, you know?... We can keep riding under the stars. All night.
M	DOUG	Woody, your headlight doesn't even work.
M	WOODY	You think I won't ride without light? I can feel the road. Let's go. I'll even race somebody. Who's racing me?
M	DOUG	Did you inhale exhaust fumes? Because something is happening to your brain. I think it might be retardation.
M	WOODY	I just want to ride. Let's go!
M	DOUG	Whatever, Corky. Doug shrugs Woody off and dials his cell phone. Hey, honey. It's me. Woody glares at Doug.
M	WOODY	You're calling Kelly? You're not aloud to call wives on a road trip. I can call my wife whenever I want. Yeah. Woody. Good guess...
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Yeah, I'm having a great time. No old Doug, yet, but I haven't gotten sun- burned... Woody looks at Bob.
M	WOODY	You agree with me, right?
M	BOB	Yeah, I actually agree with you on this one. Let's not call wives. Yeah, Bob agreed with him. Good guess again. Man, I really miss you.
M	WOODY	Are you kidding me? I have to leave. Let me know when lame hour is over. Woody, you can call Claudia when I'm done, if you want. You can use my cell.
M	WOODY	No, I'm not calling Claudia. I mean, yes I want to, but I won't. Because I'm on a road trip with my pals. And cell phones aren't even allowed! Woody storms out. Doug hears something on the phone, and Hey, Billy! How's it-- Where'd he go?... Oh. He thought you were ordering pizza. Uh huh. Well, tell him I said hi. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 55.
M	DOUG	I can't believe you made us leave so early. You really wanted to see the sun rise?
M	WOODY	Yeah, man. It warms my heart, with it's... Gentle... rays. Doug gives him a curious look, as they pass a sign that
M	BOB	Hey! Let's stop for breakfast, I'm starving.
M	WOODY	What!? No! We're not hungry yet.
M	BOB	I just said I was--
M	WOODY	You're not! Fatty! Bob looks hurt. Doug gives Woody a stern look.
M	DOUG	Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat town. And Dudley's got another bag of poop to throw away. Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the
M	BUD	Oh, don't tell me they're here again already. I just got the window replaced.
F	MAGGIE	Just stay calm, Dad. At least it's not all of them, this time. They go to park their bikes, but there's not enough
M	CHARLEY	I'll move it! Hold on, I'll move it! Charley jumps into the car and backs it out of its spot.
M	DOUG	Wow. Lucas is a polite town.
M	BOB	That's how these little towns are. It's unspoiled America.
M	WOODY	It's a shithole. Let's keep moving. The guys ignore Woody and enter the diner.
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Okay, we'll get it to go, then. We can ride and eat if it's wrapped in a tortilla. Woody gets no response. He looks back down the road,
M	BUD	Good morning, gentleman. How nice of you to join us this afternoon.
M	DOUG	well, how could we pass through this town without stopping? Everything looks so perfect. But you'll change that, huh?
M	DOUG	Excuse me? MAGGIE runs up and guides her Dad away from the guys.
F	MAGGIE	I'll take care of them, Daddy. Good morning. Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though DUDLEY stares at her, captivated. He's in love.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	where would you gentleman like to sit?
M	DOUG	Are there any booths open? All the people quickly jump out of their booths.
M	BOB	Wow. Everyone is so nice, here. The guys sit in one of the booths. Dudley hangs back, Um... So? Dudley tries to think of something else to say, but She's perfect.
M	DOUG	You like the waitress, huh?
M	DUDLEY	I wanted to say something funny to her, but I could only think of black jokes.
F	MAGGIE	And what would you gentleman like today? Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying
M	DOUG	Mmmm. I'll have what he's having. Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can keep his.
F	MAGGIE	Of course. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Maggie quickly puts it back on the man's table.
M	DOUG	Hey, it's okay. Really.
M	WOODY	Not a big deal. Yeah, just don't let it happen again! Bob hammers his fist on the table and laughs at his joke,
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Wow. That wasn't funny.
M	DUDLEY	It's hard to be funny without being racist. Doug is looking at the town's local paper, and smiles.
M	DOUG	Hey, guys. This block party tonight looks cool. Music, grilled corn, dollar beers, funnel cakes.
M	DUDLEY	Funnel cakes!? Let's stay here tonight!
M	WOODY	No, no, no, no. We have a schedule. San Francisco is waiting.
M	BOB	What schedule? You said we're taking this trip to live. Let's stick around and live a little. Have some small town fun! Woody goes to protest again, but Dudley stands up. Let's party all night in Lucas!
M	BUD	God Dammit! What'd we do to deserve this!? We ANGLE TO SEE: MAGGIE rush over to calm BUD down. Bud
M	BUD (CONT'D)	Not another one of these assholes. A moment later, MURDOCK, a fat, grungy Hells Angel, Get me a beer, old man. And if it's not good, I'm going to smash it across your face. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 60.
M	DOUG	Not another one of these assholes.
M	MURDOCK	What'd you say?
M	DOUG	Oh, I was actually referring to some guys we met at a bar about two hundred miles east of here. You're probably not
M	MURDOCK	That's my gang. I'm on my way there now.
M	DUDLEY	so he is one of those assholes, Doug.
M	MURDOCK	Excuse me? Murdock puts his beer down, and stares angrily at Doug.
M	MURDOCK (CONT'D)	And who the hell are you freaks? Doug starts to answer, but Woody, looking nervous, cuts
M	WOODY	--Oh, we're just a group of friends. No big deal. Your guys gave us permission to pass by, so it's all good.
M	MURDOCK	Hells Angel's don't give permission. Especially to a bunch of ball-less wimps like you. Bob hammers the table and stands up - his face red with
M	BOB	I'm not a wimp, pal'. I'm a man! You got that? Huh? You got that!!
M	WOODY	Bob, let's not get carried away--
M	BOB	No, you know what? This guy needs a talking to just like his friends did, Woody.
M	WOODY	But, Bob. I don't think--
M	BOB	Let me do this, Woody! You stood up to them last time, and I just sat there like I always do... Well, not this time! Listen, you piece of shit. You think you can just walk around and bully perfectly nice people? You think that's how it works? Well, guess what? This is the real world. With real laws and real consequences. You hear me!? Bob swats Murdock's beer out of his hand. It spills all
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Now get out of here! And if that gang of inbred assholes needs things explained to them again, tell 'em the Wild Hogs will be right here in Lucas tonight. Woody puts his face into his hands.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Now get. Murdock just stares daggers at him.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Get! Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock. He almost After a moment, BUD comes running out from behind the "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 62.
M	BUD	Wait... You guys aren't Hells Angels?
M	DOUG	Us? Oh, no. We're from Cincinnati. Bud calls out to the kitchen.
M	BUD	Charley!? They ain't the bad ones! CHARLEY, the sheriff from before, stands up from behind a
M	CHARLEY	You guys aren't Hells Angels?
M	DOUG	No. We're Wild Hogs. That's our gang. And our rotary club softball team... My wife had extra patches.
M	CHARLEY	Well, sweet Mary Joseph... Welcome to Lucas! I'm the sheriff, Charley Baskins. I keep the peace here.
M	DOUG	Weren't you just hiding in the kitchen?
M	CHARLEY	Well... A non-confrontation approach sometimes is the best method to keep aggression... Yeah, I was hiding in the kitchen. Charley looks at them for a moment, then starts to tear
M	CHARLEY (CONT'D)	I'm an embarrassment. Charley hurries off to the bathroom. The guys look at
M	DOUG	Well, now he is. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 63.
M	CHARLEY	Sorry about all the confusion when you arrived. Those guys are pretty rough. You're the first people to ever stand up to them.
M	DOUG	Well, Woody is the one who really--
M	BOB	Hey-- we should probably share the credit. I mean, I just basically kicked that guy's ass. Man! You know how good that felt!? Yeah! Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles
M	DOUG	Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down the block and get more exercise.
M	BOB	Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should. I'm sorry... I didn't mean to--
M	CHARLEY	Forget about it. We only have one cripple and he gets pulled around in a wagon. Come on, I want to show you guys something. Charley leads the guys off.
M	DOUG	Wow. That's fantastic.
M	BOB	You ride this?
M	CHARLEY	Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I just keep it in here. Polish it and so forth. But I'd never let them see it.
M	DOUG	Those guys are that big of a problem, huh?
M	CHARLEY	Yeah. They ride into town a few times a month and get drunk, damage property... Basically turn the place upside down.
M	DOUG	And the police don't do anything?
M	CHARLEY	Well, It's a small town - and me and the Dooble brothers are the only law. And they're still pretty green.
M	WOODY	Can't you call a bigger town or something for backup?
M	CHARLEY	Yeah, I've done that a few times. But the gang is always gone by the time they get here. We've also tried wearing riot gear, which does protect you from being hit, but not from being dragged. Also, one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw tear gas, but the bottle exploded and blew off his ear.
M	DUDLEY	Ech.
M	CHARLEY	Yeah, he's hard to look at. Anyway, we want you guys to stay at our hotel tonight on us... Seeing as you're the new town heroes and all.
M	WOODY	Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on-- We'd be honored to stay. Thank you. Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern
M	CHARLEY	And if you're not in a rush to leave in the morning-- We've got a great trout stream you might want to check out.
M	DUDLEY	Cool! Let's fish! Doug shrugs.
M	DOUG	Sure. Let's do it.
M	WOODY	Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down, here. I still get a vote on what we do, you know? And I want my vote.
M	DOUG	Okay. Of course you get a vote. Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly
M	WOODY	I actually get three votes. Because I planned the trip.
M	DOUG	But you didn't plan the voting system. I did. So you only get one. Sorry. Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.
M	WOODY	You know what? Old Doug wasn't such a douchebag! "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 66.
M	JACK	Those assholes think they can cross the Hells Angels? Do you know how bad they've made us all look!? The gang nods. They all look pissed.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Those guys have some balls. Balls I will put in my mouth and chew on!! The gang looks at Jack with a slight smile. OILCAN
M	OILCAN	You're going to put balls in your mouth? The gang laughs. Jack realizes what the joke is...
M	JACK	No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm going to stick anything I can in their asses, and I'm going to enlov it. The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Shut up!! I didn't mean-- Just get on your damn bikes! We're riding to Lucas! The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up
M	OILCAN	Sometimes it helps if you say things in your mind first, then say it out loud, you know? Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a
M	OILCAN (CONT'D)	Oww! Dammit! "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 67.
M	JACK	I did that in my mind, first. Jack smiles calmly and walks off.
M	PLUMP MAN	So you grab your girls, And you grab a couple more. And you all come meet me, in the middle of the floor. Gonna rock your body! 'Till the break of The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and Meanwhile, Doug, Bob, Woody and Dudley walk through the
M	DOUG	These people love us. This is nuts.
M	BOB	Yeah. They think we're bad asses.
M	DOUG	Well, let's not get too carried away with it. The truth is we're just regular guys. Let's not forget that.
M	DUDLEY	Yeah, the best thing is to keep a low profile. Don't cause any waves. Then if somebody pushes us too far, Boom! We go Billy Jack upside their heads!
M	WOODY	You're going to go Billy Jack?
M	DUDLEY	Nooo. I'm just minding my own business. I don't want to cause any trouble. Dudley turns to Woody and stares at him. Woody looks What?
M	DOUG	He's waiting for you to say something else, then he's going to kick you. Dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of Woody. Doug just saved you a world of hurt.
M	WOODY	You're afraid of your cat.
M	DUDLEY	Yeah, well... He once bit me on the sack. Dudley walks off towards the beer tent. Woody looks to
M	BOB	It's true. He was unclogging his bathtub drain and the cat thought it was a ball of yarn. Doug and Woody wince. ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line,
F	MAGGIE	Hi. Dudley is wide-eyed.
M	DUDLEY	Um... I, uh--- What do you call a Mercedes in Harlem?
F	MAGGIE	Excuse me?
M	DUDLEY	Nothing-- uh... Maggie notices the tattoo on Dudley's shoulder.
F	MAGGIE	Wow. You like macs too, huh? I've got a vintage Apple 2e. Restored it from scratch. Dudley's jaw drops.
M	DUDLEY	I-- have a cookie jar made out of a 2e. For fig newtons.
F	MAGGIE	Wow. I like fig newtons. Dudley collects himself and tries to speak.
M	DUDLEY	Yeah. They're like fried chicken at a-- No, that's not... Dammit! This is hard.
F	MAGGIE	You want to dance? Dudley goes to respond, then decides to just give an
M	DOUG	It doesn't get any better than this, huh? Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece
M	BOB	That's a lot of carbs. Doug stops, mid-bite, and puts the bread down.
M	DOUG	Thanks, Bob. You saved me from all that... buttery, garlicky flavor.
M	WOODY	No he didn't. Woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth. I did.
M	DOUG	I hope you choke on it. CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and
M	CHARLEY	Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party! These are my deputies: Earl and Buck Dooble. Earl shakes the guys hands.
M	EARL	I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember, the brother with the word "ear," in his I can only say that because I'm on his right side. Which as you can see, is blown off. Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious.
M	BUCK	I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck telling us apart! Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing
M	DOUG	Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've got a great town here.
M	CHARLEY	Yeah, we got everything here. Good people, good fishing...
M	EARL	We do have convicted child molesters, though. We have to disclose that.
M	CHARLEY	Not if they don't have kids, Earl.
M	EARL	Just to be safe, though. Hey!! Thomas Milborn! A bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks. Convicted child molester. Thomas Milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his
M	BOB	Well... Still a nice town.
M	WOODY	If you're not a kid.
M	DOUG	Or Thomas Milborn. Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along
M	CHARLEY	Looks like your friend and Maggie are hitting it off.
M	DOUG	Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.
M	CHARLEY	Well, Maggie's a great woman.
M	EARL	Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but you know... He's a deformed freak. Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley,
M	BUCK	I used to like that girl... but then I realized, I can do better. The guys look at Buck.
M	CHARLEY	So, why are you guys taking this road trip, anyway?
M	DOUG	Ahh, just to escape for a bit.
M	WOODY	Hey, we're not escaping anything, man. We're on this trip to live.
M	CHARLEY	I know what you mean. Sometimes things in life can bother you, and sometimes nothing in life can bother you. Either way, you've got take a break from it. Happiness is somewhere between boredom and stress. Doug is surprised at Charley's insight. So is Woody.
M	WOODY	Exactly. Which is why we need to keep riding until we figure out where that happiness is. You don't get old Doug back by just staying put.
M	CHARLEY	Old Doug?
M	DOUG	Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't sing Bon Jovi anymore.
M	WOODY	You did lose him, Doug. You know why? You're housebroken. You're too comfortable. You've got to snap out of it! Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right. Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable can be a bad thing. You have to wake up and slap the bull once in a while.
M	WOODY	Right! Slap the bull! What?
M	CHARLEY	Slapping the bull is kind of the local test of manhood. It's a way to prove you aren't controlled by fear. We've all done it.
M	EARL	Yup. Even torn-open head, here. He nods at Buck, on his left.
M	BUCK	You know, I slapped the bull once. Woody smiles slyly. Doug looks concerned.
M	WOODY	We're slapping the bull.
M	DOUG	I don't think we need to. I mean, we can have our own test of manhood. Let's see how many ears of corn we can eat or something. I'll start. Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody
M	WOODY	We are slapping the bull. Doug knows it's no use. He nods, defeated.
M	CHARLEY	Here we are. The Lucas test of manhood. Slap the bull. Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture.
M	WOODY	Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull?
M	EARL	Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail it out of there, because he can kill ya.
M	DOUG	Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea, so... go ahead. Woody nods.
M	WOODY	All right. I'm going in.
M	DOUG / BOB	You are?
M	WOODY	Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out of that bull. Like, pimp-style. The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed. The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Whhhheeeeeeew! Woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over. The guys Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just slapped a big fat bull right on his ass! Did you hear how pissed he was!? I just pissed of a bull! Bitch! Woody high fives all the guys.
M	DOUG	All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that bull. The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts Thanks for bringing us out here. Doug really needs this.
M	BOB	Yeah. This is good for him.
M	CHARLEY	Sure. Glad we could help.
M	BUCK	Yeah, and we've never seen it done twice in a row. It'll be interesting to see how the bull takes being slapped now that he's alert.
M	WOODY / BOB	Alert? Woody and Bob look at each other, then to the Bull -
M	WOODY	Doug, wait! It's too late. Doug slaps the bull hard, and turns to "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 76.
M	DOUG	Wheeeeew!! Yeah! Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Ahhhhhhhh! It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into
M	WOODY	Oh, no you don't! Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull! The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Run, Doug! Go! Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody. The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob
M	BOB	Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of this!? Come get this! Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Hah! Missed me, you fat bastard! Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged that stupid cow! How cool am-- Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's
M	BOB (CONT'D)	You son of a bitch! You want to keep it going!? You want to take cheap shots!? Come on! Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys Give me your gun! Give me the gun! He deserves it! I'll kill you! Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down. Doug
M	WOODY	No this is living!
M	DOUG	We just slapped the bull! The group high fives each other in congratulations, and
M	WOODY	Man, did you see the look on Bob's face when he got up? Didn't dodge him that time! Woody and Doug laugh. Bob looks pissed.
M	BOB	I'm going to go back there with a rifle tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off. Then we'll see who's tough. Why just one leg?
M	BOB	Because I want to kick him in the face.
M	DOUG	Hey, Dud. You look happy.
M	DUDLEY	I danced with her. And she likes macs. You know what that means?
M	DOUG	You have a sister?
M	DUDLEY	I have a soulmate.
M	DOUG	I thought you said the color ipod was your soulmate. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 79.
M	DUDLEY	I thought it was. But now, I realize that ipod was just a well-designed whore. The guys smile. It's been a good night for all of them.
M	DOUG	Come on. Let's go back to the hotel. We've got to get up early to do some fishing. The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel.
M	WOODY	Okay, fine. But after fishing - we hit the open road and keep moving, okay?
M	DOUG	Open road, baby!
M	BOB	Wild Hogs ride! The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the
M	DOUG	Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going to have to talk to these guys again. Get them to leave this town alone--
M	WOODY	Hiiiiiiiidee! DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Go! Go! Go! Woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port-o-potty,
M	DOUG	Woody!? What the hell is wrong with--
M	WOODY	Shhhh! They'll hear you! Don't make a sound! Good evening, Lucas. Now, as hurt as I am that you're having a party and didn't invite us... We're only here for one reason. The "Wild Hogs." Where the hell are they!?
M	JACK	Come on, now. You shouldn't be protecting them. These "Wild Hogs," not only passed us when we specifically told them not to, they drained out all our gas and burned down our bar. Like the little cowards they are. Now where are they!!?
M	BOB	You son of a bitch! Bob lunges at Woody, but the sudden shifting of weight is What is that? It's that blue port-o-potty juice. It's coming out of the can. The guys all cringe in disgust, but know they can't move. Now, that's a port-o-potty that ain't worth shit. The Hell's Angels all laugh and turn back to the diner.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	All right, then. Nobody wants to tell me where they are? Fine. Maybe this'll jar your memory. Jack takes a garbage can and tosses it into the diner
M	CHARLEY	I think they're out at Mckinley's pasture. Something about slapping a bull. It's up past the lake a ways. Jack smiles.
M	JACK	Good. Saddle up, boys. The guys get on their bikes. And if they ain't there. We'll be back reeeal soon. Because I don't let any man get away from me. The gang snickers. Jack realizes; Shut the hell up! I didn't-- You know what I meant! Jack starts his bike and roars out of the town. The
M	KIDS	Go ahead and come back! The Wild Hogs aren't afraid you! The Wild Hogs aren't afraid of anything! Suddenly, the door pops open on the port-o-potty and the They scramble to their feet and run towards the large "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 83.
M	DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY	Ahhhh!/ I'm going to vomit!/ Ecchhh! The townspeople watch in silence as the guys jump into
M	BOB	It got in my hair! Gross! The guys desperately try to rinse off the juice - then, You lied, didn't you!? You stood there and lied to us!
M	BOB	You did! You're a stinking liar!
M	WOODY	I did it for you guys! I wanted you to live!
M	DOUG	Live!? We're going to die, Woody! You burned down their bar! We are dead men!
M	DUDLEY	Oh, man. I thought it was going to happen slowly. I thought I had time! I'm sorry, okay!
M	DOUG	Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!?
M	WOODY	Yes, I'm sorry! I just didn't want us to go back.
M	DOUG	Why? It's just a stupid vacation!
M	WOODY	Because I don't have anything to go back to, okay! Doug and Bob go silent. Woody looks away - trying to
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	I've lost everything. The firm fired me, Claudia left me... It's all gone. My whole life is gone. I don't even have enough money to get my lawn raked anymore. Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	That's why I couldn't go back. This isn't a vacation for me, it's the only thing I have left. There's nothing more in my life but you guys. So, I lied about the Hells Angels. I lied because I wanted to have one thing in my life that wasn't a complete failure. A real trip with my best friends... You're all I got. I'm sorry. Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a
M	DOUG	This trip is just you running from your life. Your miserable, screwed up life. And you knew you couldn't go back to it, so instead you screwed up our lives, too... You asshole! Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves.
M	WOODY	Fine! I see how important I am to you guys. That's just fine. I just thought being a "Wild Hog" meant something! Woody takes off his "Wild Hogs" jacket and throws it at
M	DOUG	It doesn't mean anything! It's just a patch my wife made!! Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment,
M	CHARLEY	Looks like they're winding down some.
M	DOUG	You think? Alright, Wild Hogs. We know you're in town somewhere, 'cause you haven't checked out of the hotel. We're a little smarter than you thought, huh?
M	OILCAN	Hell yeah we are!! Wheeew! Oilcan smashes a beer can against his own head.
M	JACK	So we're going to wait right here 'till you show up. Weeks, if we have to. Hell, we might just make ourselves the "Lucas Angels." That has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 86.
M	DUDLEY	Crap. I was thinking of that for us.
M	CHARLEY	You guys just stay in the station tonight. No one needs to go out there and be a hero and end up getting hurt.
M	DOUG	Thanks, Charley. Charley and the Dooble brothers look a little surprised.
M	CHARLEY	Wow. So... You're not going out there? Doug sighs in irritation. Well, you're the cop. Why don't you go out there? Charley is visibly hurt. His lip starts to tremble. That's not cool, man. Charley runs out the back door of the station. EARL
M	EARL	You know, people have feelings. Sure, I make comments about "chum face," here. But that's because every time I look at him I see parts of his brain. But nobody has the right to hurt Charley like that. He has both sides of his head. Earl storms off, leaving BUCK, who was standing on his Um... They left.
M	BUCK	Huh? Buck turns and sees Earl and Charley have gone.
M	BUCK (CONT'D)	Son of a bitch. Buck hurries out the door after Charley and Earl. BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach
M	DOUG	They're still out there. Passed out.
M	BOB	Well, I talked to Karen. She going to fly out here, rent a mini-van, and pick us up. We'll just ship the bikes back later.
M	DOUG	Bob, we can't leave. They'll just stay here and keep terrorizing this town.
M	BOB	So what? They can call the National guard or something.
M	DOUG	For what? To be stationed here permanently? Because these guys will just come back when they're gone. And it'll be even worse.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	We've created this problem, Bob. We've got to think of a way to solve it.
M	BOB	Well, Karen is really insistent she come drive us back.
M	DOUG	Tell her "no," Bob. Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought.
M	BOB	I can't do that.
M	DOUG	Well, you're going to have to, Bob! We're not going to screw over an entire town because you're afraid of women! Bob stands up, insulted.
M	BOB	Oh, sorry I'm not brave like you, Doug! The guy who gets injections in his scalp so he won't go bald! Bob storms out the back door of the police station.
M	DUDLEY	You do? Doug shrugs weakly.
M	DOUG	You know, you can storm out too, if you want.
M	DUDLEY	No, no. I mean, I thought about going to see Maggie while those guys are asleep, but you need me right now.
M	DOUG	Thanks, man. Doug smiles and gives Dudley a squeeze on the shoulder.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	You okay? "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 89. You're always asking me if I'm okay! Dudley quickly storms out of the police station. Doug Thought you might be out here. Doug turns and sees BUD, the owner of the diner, Bud has
M	DOUG	Hey, Bud. Look, I'm sorry we got your town in all this trouble. This trip was supposed to fix problems, not cause them.
M	BUD	Well, maybe it's trying to and you just won't let it.
M	DOUG	What do you mean? Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing.
M	BUD	It's the funny thing about life. It has to be an adventure to feel right. But when you become a husband and a Dad, you realize adventure is risk, and a family man has no place in his life for risk. Doug takes this in, then realizes.
M	DOUG	You're right. That's why I stopped singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a risk. That was old Doug. And now it's gone. I've taken away all the risk.
M	BUD	Yup. And if you try to make livin' too safe, then it's not livin' at all.
M	DOUG	It's not. And I have a will, now. So, I only have so much livin' left. And somehow I've lost the best part of it.
M	BUD	Well, maybe these will help you find it. Bud puts a styrofoam container on Doug's lap. Doug looks
M	DOUG	These are worms.
M	BUD	Yup. To fish with.
M	DOUG	I don't get it.
M	BUD	Friends that screw up. Angry bikers. That's not something you should be avoiding. That's something you need. Doug takes this in.
M	DOUG	What's that have to do with worms?
M	BUD	Go down to the lake and find out.
M	WOODY	Hey.
M	DOUG	Hey. Going fishing?
M	WOODY	Yup. Woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at Doug.
M	DOUG	I've got worms. I mean, in here. Doug holds up the styrofoam cup. Woody shrugs.
M	WOODY	All right. Let's go. Doug helps Woody shove the boat out into the water. They
M	DOUG	Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about Claudia. And the job. Thanks.
M	DOUG	But, you shouldn't have lied to us--
M	WOODY	You know what? I screwed up! It happens. Maybe from now on I'm better off just doing things on my own! Woody starts to get up, but then looks at the water
M	DOUG	You would have stormed off right then, huh? Yeah. Doug nods and looks out at the water. They sit there in
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	I didn't want to lose, Doug. I've lost everything else and I didn't want to lose this trip with you guys. When we're together, it's like we're all college kids still. I'm not a guy with a broken marriage and failed career. I'm just with my best friends, being happy. And to keep it going, I forgot about what made it so great... That friends never let each other down. Until now. I screwed up the last thing I had left. You guys deserve better. I'm sorry-- Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from
M	DOUG	Well, what's the point of being in a motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in a little trouble? Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	It'll be okay, man. Woody smiles a little as well.
M	WOODY	They won't kill us, right? Just a... really bad beating.
M	DOUG	Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.
M	WOODY	No way. And how much could a punch really hurt? Not much, probably.
M	DOUG	Well, the good thing is we'll be able to know for sure. That'll be cool.
M	WOODY	Let's go find the Bob and Dudley. Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.
M	DOUG	Did you bring the paddles?
M	WOODY	No. I wasn't even going to take this thing out, but I didn't want you to think I was just standing at the lake waiting for you.
M	DOUG	Why were you here?
M	WOODY	Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait for you. Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a
M	BOB	Hey, guys.
M	DOUG	Hey, Bob. Worms? Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.
M	BOB	Are we all good?
M	WOODY	Yeah, Bob. We're all good. Woody smiles at Doug. Throw us that paddle. Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the
M	BOB	Shit. Hold on. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 94.
M	DOUG	Were those the only two paddles? Yeah.
M	DOUG	Oh. Bob sits down on the grass.
M	BOB	You guys'll drift in. Yeah. Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still
F	MAGGIE	Well, we can't seat many people in there, but at least we're back in business.
M	DUDLEY	Sorry those jerks are in your diner.
F	MAGGIE	Ah, we're used to them costing us money. Last year we spent more on window glass than pancake batter. All because of them. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 95.
M	DUDLEY	It makes me sick. Thinking they're too good for pancakes.
F	MAGGIE	No, I meant... They damage the diner a lot. They damage the whole town. I'm just sorry you guys got dragged into it. You were just out to have a good vacation. Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely.
M	DUDLEY	This has been the best vacation of my life. I met you. Maggie blushes.
F	MAGGIE	You bikers probably tell all the girls that. This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled.
M	DUDLEY	Maggie, I have to tell you something. I'm not really a cool biker or a cool... anything. I'm a computer programmer. A nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She watches me sleep and I don't know why. I think she's waiting for me to stop breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm not. Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and
F	MAGGIE	You're not a geek, Dudley. You're sweet and your honest and... You're the coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if it doesn't like you as much as I do. Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Well, I better get back inside. I've got to set some chairs up in the family room for the lunch rush. People gotta eat.
M	DUDLEY	Oh, people will eat. Don't you worry, Maggie. People will eat.
M	DUDLEY	Alright, let's end this! The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his Hey! ! Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips
M	JACK	Well, well. One of you came to face the music, huh? That's brave. And stupid. The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and
M	DUDLEY	I'm not here to face any music. I'm here to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd be smart to take.
M	JACK	Yeah? What deal?
M	DUDLEY	You leave the town of Lucas, and my friends alone, and I do something for you. Something you can't live without. Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	See where that says "Domain for sale?" Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't have a website! Nothing! No way to tell people about your history, post photos, sell shirts... You guys are living in the complete dark ages! So they way I see it: I need a favor from you and you need a favor from me. Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a No deal. Dudley nods.
M	DUDLEY	Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out.
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	Sanctuary! Sanctuary!! The Hells Angels pull off him, confused.
M	OILCAN	What?
M	DUDLEY	Sanctuary. You have to take me to a church and leave me alone. The Hells Angels look at each other and shrug. No we don't. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 98. I know. The Hells Angels move back in on him. Dudley closes his
M	BUD	If you're heading back to town, I wouldn't go on an empty stomach. The guys see Bud and smile.
M	BUD (CONT'D)	Come have lunch. This is kind of our "fallout" diner. Smaller kitchen, but
M	DOUG	Well, we can change that. Bud laughs as the guys enter the house.
M	CHARLEY	Hey, guys. Having your final meal? Charley laughs. Doug, Bob and Woody don't.
M	CHARLEY (CONT'D)	Sorry. Where are Buck and Earl?
M	CHARLEY	They're coming. Buck's ear is giving him some equilibrium problems. Just keep your eyes forward and head up.
M	BUCK	I'm fine. Buck walks a few more steps, then starts to tilt left.
M	EARL	Goddammit. Earl helps Buck up and they join the guys at their table.
M	BUCK	Hey, guys. Having your final meal? Buck and Earl laugh. Nobody else does.
M	CHARLEY	That's out of line, guys.
M	EARL	Sorry. Buck looks around the table.
M	BUCK	Hey, isn't one of you missing?
M	WOODY	Yeah, Dudley's with Maggie somewhere.
F	MAGGIE	Hey, guys. Where's Dudley?
M	DOUG	He's with you, isn't he?
F	MAGGIE	No. I thought he went to find you guys. Doug shares a worried glance with Bob and Woody. Charley, can I borrow your phone? Charley hands it to him, and Doug starts to dial.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Dudley has mine. I'll just call him.
M	WOODY	He has a phone? What happened to freedom? He needed to call his answering machine so his cat could hear his voice. Here we go. It's ringing... He probably snuck off somewhere to buy you some romantic gift or something. No big deal.
M	BOB	That's it. He's never had a girlfriend so he's probably getting carried away. He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte's because the Starbucks clerk was smiling at him.
M	WOODY	I remember that. His pee turned brown and he started crying.
M	DOUG	Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling - she just had a cleft lip. Hello? Dudley? Try again, asshole.
M	DOUG	Nope. The Hells Angels have him. Doug gives a look to the other guys. They mouth "Shit:" Damn right, the Hells Angels. Your friend paid us a little visit. And now he's hurting reeeeal bad.
M	DUDLEY	No, I actually feel pretty-- Jack kicks Dudley's chair with his foot. It tips over
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	Ow! Hey, a peanut. Dudley tries to stick his tongue out to get the peanut. Crap. So here's what we're going to do, now. You guys are going to pay us a visit. And you're going to bring a "disobedience fee," of ten thousand dollars. Cash. And don't even think about calling any cops. Just you guys and ten grand. And if you don't show up in an hour - Well then, We'll just take the fine out of your friend's legs... Which we're going to break with a tire iron.
M	DUDLEY	Don't bring the money, guys! I'm a computer programmer! I don't need my legs! Jack considers this and turns back to the phone. His hands! We'll break his hands!
M	DUDLEY	Dammit. Bring the money! We'll bring the money. Just don't touch our friend! Oh, I won't touch him if you bring that money. But if you don't, I'll be touching him all night long. And I'll be enjoying it. The other bikers suddenly stifle laughter.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	What!? There was nothing wrong with that one! That was tough! Those guys are afraid of me, now. They know how much I want 'em! The gang laughs again.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Shut up!! The gang stops laughing, off Jack's warning glare.
M	DUDLEY	Hey can we call my cat, now? She needs to hear my voice. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 103. Get me more duct tape? A biker nods and grabs another role of duct tape. He
M	DUDLEY	Crap. Sweet Dudley. He went there to save everybody and now they're going to break his hands.
M	DOUG	No they aren't. We're going to get him back.
M	CHARLEY	We sure are. I'm going to call the Highway Patrol. They'll be there in--
M	BOB	No way. They said no law. We can't risk them doing anything to Dudley.
M	WOODY	Bob's right. We can call the Highway Patrol after we get Dud back, but we shouldn't piss these guys off while he's still in their hands.
M	BOB	I'm going to call Karen and have the cash wired out of our savings.
M	WOODY	No. No way. This is my fault. All this is my fault. I have some money in my severance package. We're using it.
F	MAGGIE	Wait, he did this because of me. I have a thousand dollars in tip money I want to put in.
M	BUD	I have a couple thousand in the diner emergency fund I'll put in, too. Doug, who has been thinking all this over, stands up from
M	DOUG	No. Nobody is paying anything. Everyone stops and gives Doug a puzzled look. He has a
M	WOODY	What?
M	DOUG	We're not calling the Highway patrol. We're not gathering ten thousand dollars. We're going over there and getting our friend back.
M	CHARLEY	I don't think that's the safest plan.
M	DOUG	It's not. But sometimes you have to do the things that aren't safe, to create a world that you're happy being in. These Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand dollars. They want our dignity. They want us to be afraid of them just like this town is. And once they know we're afraid, they can do whatever they want. That's how these guys exist. That's how they ride into this town and tear it to pieces... Because people want to keep their lives safe so badly, they give up the best part about it... Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	.The adventure. Doug looks at Woody and Bob. Woody smiles and pulls on "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 105.
M	WOODY	And the friends. Woody steps over to Doug. Bob looks at them for a
M	BOB	Let's go slap the bull. Doug smiles and taps fists with Bob and Woody. The front door of the bar opens and the HELLS ANGELS
M	JACK	Well, well. The "Wild Hogs." I'm glad to see you're finally showing us a little respect.
M	DOUG	Where's Dudley? Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels.
M	DUDLEY	Hey, guyth. Doug shakes his head.
M	DOUG	Just hold tight, Dudley. All right. Hand him over.
M	JACK	Sure. Where's the cash? Doug looks to Bob and Woody. They nod encouragingly.
M	DOUG	We're not giving you any money. Jack looks surprised.
M	JACK	Excuse me?
M	DOUG	We're not going to play your games. We're all adults, here. It's not highschool. I'm sorry your bar got burned down, and we'll be glad to help you get it rebuilt, but we're done being bullied by you. Now give us back Dudley, and get out of this town. The Hells Angels start to laugh. Jack turns back to them
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Give us back our friend, asshole! The Hells Angels are suddenly silent. Jack turns back
M	JACK	What did you just call me?
M	DOUG	Ass... hole.
M	JACK	You know what? I was just going to pulverize your friend, here. But now I'm pissed off. You're all going to get hurt. Hells Angels style. Guys! What!? I thought they'd back down!
M	WOODY	We can still outrun them. They're fat. Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in
M	JACK	Hear that, guys!? He called you all fat!
M	WOODY	shit. I meant full-figured. The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the "Wild
M	DOUG	Wait!! Wait a minute! The Hells Angels stop. You want to beat the shit out of us? Fine. But you outnumber us forty to three. You think there's honor in that? Why don't we make it fair, if you guys are so freaking tough? The leader of our gang against the leader of yours. Jack smirks. He's twice as big as Doug.
M	JACK	Me against you?
M	DOUG	Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you win, we'll give you ten grand and go back home. You'll never see us again. But... If I win, you let Dudley go and you never set foot in Lucas again. This town is off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Well? You in, or are you too much of a bitch? The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage
M	JACK	All right. Let's party, tough guy.
M	DOUG	Great. Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly Great.
M	WOODY	Just stay clear of the big punches. You've got more stamina than this guy.
M	DOUG	All right. When do I hit back?
M	WOODY	Um... Just try and get him tired. I don't think punches will do much to him. Time for your beating, yuppie! "Wild Hogs" writers first draft Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a truck. Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle. All right. Let's do this-- Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt! It really hurts. Damn! Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right,
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Yes!-- But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's
M	JACK	Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just beginning. Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He
M	DOUG	Hah! Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 110.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Damn. Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug
M	JACK	Man, this isn't even a workout. Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as
M	DOUG	Ahhh! Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims
M	JACK	This one's gonna break bone.
M	DOUG	Wait! Wait-- Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal abscess.
M	JACK	What?
M	DOUG	look, I really hate you, but I don't want to feel responsible for a death. I'm a dentist. I took an oath. Same one as doctors. If the infection in that tooth gets to the root - it could seep into your nervous system. Just let me look-- Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't
M	JACK	You're a dentist? "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 111.
M	DOUG	Yeah. One of the best. And I know when your gums are that swollen and your And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack
M	BOB	Yeah, Doug!
M	WOODY	Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him get up! Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot
M	JACK	All right. Now you're going to die. Jack approaches Doug, who closes his eyes and waits for
M	WOODY	Wait!! Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.
M	WOODY (CONT'D)	Doug's not the leader of this gang. I-- Thanks, man.
M	WOODY	Sure. Jack looks at Bob.
M	JACK	Anybody else the leader of this gang? Bob takes a deep breath, and bends down an grabs a long
M	BOB	Alright, Mother f-- Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground. Just stay down. Bob nods.
M	JACK	Well, I guess that's all of you-- DUDLEY, still covered in tape, comes running into the
M	DUDLEY	Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not
M	DUDLEY (CONT'D)	Ow. Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN.
M	JACK	Give me the crowbar. Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack. Jack smiles at the
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Guess you guys are wishing you'd listened, now, huh? Jack smiles as we hear: Jack and the Hells Angels look up the road.
M	CHARLEY	All right, Jack. That'll be enough of that.
M	JACK	Are you kidding? And what makes you think you can ride a motorcycle without our permission?
M	CHARLEY	I'll ride whatever I want from now on. I'm the sheriff of Lucas, and I'm not tolerating any more lawlessness. BOB helps DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY to their feet, as Jack
M	CHARLEY (CONT'D)	I'd stop right there, Jack. Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns.
M	JACK	What? You're going to shoot us?
M	CHARLEY	No. Not unless you want to do something stupid like ignoring-- Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his
M	OILCAN	Ahhhhhh! He shot me! I just got shot!! Charley looks over at Buck, then back to Jack.
M	CHARLEY	Um... Yeah, I guess we're going to shoot you. The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous, and back up a few
M	CHARLEY (CONT'D)	We're not going to live in fear of your gang anymore, Jack. If the Wild Hogs can stand up to you - so can everyone of us. That's right. You mess up our town, we'll do the same to you! The crowd cheers as THOMAS MILBORN, the guy Earl pointed
M	THOMAS MILBORN	Yeah! People like you are the scum of the earth! The crowd is silent for a moment, then hesitantly gives a
M	CHARLEY	The point is, from now on you need to treat Lucas with kindness and respect. And when you do, you'll be treated the same. And if you don't... Charley looks over at OILCAN, who's tending to the bullet Then I guess we'll keep... shooting you. Got it? Jack looks at all the townspeople. He knows he's beaten.
M	CHARLEY (CONT'D)	Good. Now I'd like you to untape our friend Dudley. Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels. He grabs
M	DUDLEY	Ow. Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. Ow!... After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks
M	CHARLEY	And I believe that's his jacket. Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket
M	CHARLEY (CONT'D)	And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was traded to Dudley. Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and
M	JACK	No way. He can have his Sportster back.
M	CHARLEY	Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack. Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley. Hope you're happy. You suburban posers are a disease. You need to learn some damn respect for real bikers. Doug smiles.
M	DOUG	You still don't get it do you, Jack?
M	JACK	Get what?
M	DOUG	We are the real bikers. As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and
M	DUDLEY LOOKS	as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap.
M	DUDLEY	Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I guess. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 116.
M	CHARLEY	Well, I wish you guys would stay longer.
M	DOUG	Ahh, we should be heading back. I think we've had enough excitement for one trip.
M	EARL	You guys were a blessing to this place. I mean... I'm not going to get all emotional like "hamburger head" here always does. Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He
M	BUCK	What'd you just call me? Um...
M	BUCK	It's just a little scar! I'm still better looking than you! Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left Dammit! Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob.
M	DOUG	You guys ready to head back?
M	WOODY	You know what? I think I'm going to press on. Keep heading West.
M	DOUG	You are?
M	WOODY	Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my life again. And I'd like to see what San Francisco's all about. Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.
M	BOB	I'm in, too! Let's ride to San-- Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.
M	BOB / DOUG	Karen? / Kelly? I told you I was coming, Bob! Hey, honey. Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her.
M	DOUG	Hey, baby. What are you doing here?
F	KELLY	Karen said you guys were in trouble. I kept calling your cell, but somebody programmed it to not receive calls from our house. Doug shoots Woody a look. Excuse me. Woody hurries over to his bike. KAREN turns to BOB.
F	KAREN	Well, I hope you guys had a nice trip. Now get in the van. We're going home.
M	BOB	Um... Actually, we just decided we were going to keep pressing West for a few--
F	KAREN	Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out here, rented a car, drove to this podunk As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then
M	BOB	--Karen! Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.
M	BOB (CONT'D)	Listen to me. This is My vacation and if I want to ride on with my friends, well that's what I'm going to do! And if you have a problem with that, well... Tough shit! There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The Okay. Sorry... Just... be careful. Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe
M	BOB	I will. And... I love you. Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike.
F	KELLY	So are you going, too?
M	DOUG	I hadn't really decided. I have been having a good time, though. I even got beaten up. Doug winks cockily. Kelly lights up.
F	KELLY	There he is! I saw old Doug! Doug blushes.
M	DOUG	You'll see him even more if you and Billy meet me in San Francisco. We've got a suite at the Ritz-Carlton. Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks
F	KELLY	What about work? And Billy's school? Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world.
M	DOUG	Ahh. We can risk it. Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	We ready?
M	WOODY	I think so. Dudley? What do you think?
M	DUDLEY	Let's ride. They start their motorcycles. The engines roar to life. "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 120. I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back. I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back... I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride! I'm wanted... The other guys smile and join in:
M	DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY	Dead or alive! They all look at each other as they continue to sing over
M	DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY (CONT'D)	Ohh, I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side!
M	DOUG	Wante-ee--ed!
M	DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY	Dead or aliiiivvvee!
