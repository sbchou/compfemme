M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	GIRL	Go on now Paul, don't be long.
M	GIRL	Paul... Paul? The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.
M	GIRL	Paul?! The glow fades again. MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble" by Paul Simon.
M	CLIVE	Beautiful piece.
M	VENDER	Damn straight. Practical performance. 100% Japanese, folded steel. Real hero shit.
M	CLIVE	How much? CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.
M	GRAHAM	Aren't you gonna get it?
M	CLIVE	No, it's rubbish.
M	GRAHAM	What are you going to ask?
M	CLIVE	Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment?
M	GRAHAM	I was going to ask that! Tough tits four eyes.
M	SECURITY	Alright, next! Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
M	MICHAEL BIEHN	Hey there. Who's it to?
M	GRAHAM	Graham.
M	MICHAEL BIEHN	Graham.
M	GRAHAM	Uh... are you... did you?
M	MICHAEL BIEHN	There you go. SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.
M	MICHAEL BIEHN	Hey there. Who's it to?
M	CLIVE	Clive.
M	MICHAEL BIEHN	Clive.
M	CLIVE	Uh... are you... did you?
M	MICHAEL BIEHN	There you go. SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.
M	CLIVE	I... I need to photograph him.
M	SECURITY	You can take it from there. CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
M	GRAHAM	That was amazing. I was actually a bit nervous.
M	CLIVE	Really? I wasn't.
M	GRAHAM	Good egg, wasn't he?
M	CLIVE	Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I forgot to give him my card. CLIVE points at SECURITY.
M	GRAHAM	Give it to Colossus.
M	CLIVE	Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here! She NEEDS to call me.
M	PUBLICIST	Looks good, right?
M	CLIVE	Yes, it's very impressive.
M	PUBLICIST	It really does the image justice. I never noticed the third tit.
M	CLIVE	That was Graham's idea.
M	PUBLICIST	Ladies man, huh? You guys happy? You got enough pens? You wanna Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?
M	CLIVE	I'll have a fat Coke please?
M	PUBLICIST	A fat what?
M	CLIVE	Coke.
M	PUBLICIST	Oh you man a FAT Coke.
M	CLIVE	A what?
M	PUBLICIST	Fat coke.
M	CLIVE	Yes please.
M	GRAHAM	When do we start?
M	PUBLICIST	Ten minutes ago.
M	CLIVE	Why is it so quiet?
M	PUBLICIST	Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main pavillion.
M	CLIVE	Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains.
M	PUBLICIST	I can make a call.
M	CLIVE	Please.
M	PUBLICIST	It'll pick up when he's done.
M	GRAHAM	I'm nervous.
M	CLIVE	Don't be. The hard work's done, we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page.
M	PUBLICIST	Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.
M	GRAHAM	Thank you.
M	CLIVE	All we have to do now is sit back and enjoy. A child approaches.
M	CLIVE	Queen Jelva welcomes thee.
M	CHILD	Do you know where Sylar's on?
M	CLIVE	Main pavillion.
M	CHILD	Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome. They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE
M	PUBLICIST	Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?
M	CLIVE	Three copies.
M	PUBLICIST	Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you should have given her four.
M	GRAHAM	That's sick.
M	PUBLICIST	Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.
M	CLIVE	Yeah, but three copies?
M	PUBLICIST	Better than Carl Weathers.
M	GRAHAM	Would you like a copy?
M	PUBLICIST	Are you nuts? My office is full of junk. The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.
M	CLIVE	Graham, I need a drink.
M	CLIVE (O.S.)	It was like the Prancing Pony in there.
M	GRAHAM	Nasty Hobbitses. CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
M	CLIVE	They think they're so cool.
M	GRAHAM	Hey, are you excited about going to Area 51?
M	CLIVE	Hell yes.
M	GRAHAM	06.30 check out?
M	CLIVE	A-ffirmative. GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.
M	CLIVE	Three, two, one...
M	GRAHAM CLIVE	Beep. Beep.
M	CLIVE	Good night, Graham.
M	GRAHAM	Good night, Clive. They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
M	GRAHAM	Are you asleep?
M	CLIVE	No.
M	GRAHAM	Shall we try and storm the Citadel before we nod off?
M	CLIVE	Couldn't hurt could it? We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
M	CLIVE	Cover me.
M	VALET	There you go.
M	GRAHAM	That's not ours.
M	VALET	No?
M	CLIVE	No, that's ours. A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
M	VALET	Oh. GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
M	VALET	Fucking Borg. Assimilate this! The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
M	GRAHAM	Breakfast?
M	CLIVE	Java. Straight up.
M	GRAHAM	Any solids?
M	CLIVE	No, let's punch through. Miles make the eggs taste sweeter.
M	GRAHAM	I love eggs!
M	CLIVE	I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on the go and jump in the Chewie seat. I need your map skills.
M	GRAHAM	Good job I pre-pared. GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
M	GRAHAM	It's a shame I don't have some controls on this side. That way, I could take over if you needed the loo.
M	CLIVE	Yeah, I could say "take the helm."
M	GRAHAM	"Take the helm, number one."
M	CLIVE	Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I need a number two." They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
M	GRAHAM	"Least I've got Cerebro, eh?
M	CLIVE	Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream?
M	GRAHAM	Impressive.
M	CLIVE	Most impressive.
M	GRAHAM	And let's not forget, we've always got Analogue. GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.
M	CLIVE	Not when we're driving Graham.
M	GRAHAM	Sorry. GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
M	GRAHAM	Sounds like coffee o'clock.
M	CLIVE	Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've had my first cup of J. GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.
M	GRAHAM	Looks like a pile of dead droids. A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
M	WAITRESS	You boys all set? Can I get you anything else? GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.
M	CLIVE	Amazing, isn't it? There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles. Where is everybody?
M	GRAHAM	What about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking?
M	CLIVE	Apart from her. I suppose that's why they established the Dreamland facility out here.
M	GRAHAM	Far from prying eyes.
M	CLIVE	Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings?
M	GRAHAM	Yes.
M	CLIVE	Oh.
M	GRAHAM	Shall we have a bite before or after we hit the Black Mailbox?
M	CLIVE	Before.
F	PAT	"Watch The Skies" or "Alien Onboard?" GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	"Alien Onboard."
F	PAT	Nice choice. So, where have you boys come from? San Diego.
F	PAT	Comic-Con?
M	CLIVE	How could you tell? We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
F	PAT	Just a guess. My nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago. Sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk we've had in here.
M	CLIVE	Encounter Briefs?
F	PAT	That's it. You heard of it, huh?
M	CLIVE	I've got all six.
F	PAT	Well whaddya know? Small world.
M	CLIVE	Do you get a lot of UFO types round here? We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
F	PAT	Some.
M	GRAHAM	Have you ever seen one?
F	PAT	A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.
M	GRAHAM	Really?! You've seen more than one UFOs?
F	PAT	Well, I don't know what they were. So as far as I'm concerned they're unidentified and they were definitely flying.
M	CLIVE	And objects.
F	PAT	Damn straight. Whether or not they were spaceships, I can't say. Probably not, but I'd like to think they were. Be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe.
M	CLIVE	Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons?
F	PAT	Yes.
M	CLIVE	Oh.
F	PAT	Makes you think though, don't it?
M	CLIVE	What?
F	PAT	Where is everybody? GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.
F	PAT	You boys all set?
M	CLIVE	I'd like a cup of coffee please.
F	PAT	Sure thing. How about you, sugar?
M	GRAHAM	Can I have an E.T. malt please?
F	PAT	You wanna sparkler in that? GRAHAM smiles coyly.
F	PAT	I'll take that as a yes. She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
M	CLIVE	It's nice here, isn't it?
M	GRAHAM	Absolutely.
M	CLIVE	I think I might use the loo. CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent
F	PAT	Yes dear, what can I get you?
M	JAKE	Two beers.
F	PAT	Coming right up.
M	CLIVE	That is absolutely amazing!
M	CLIVE	Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up into my palms. CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
M	CLIVE	I'm joking, of course. They have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head. When you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth. Clive...
M	CLIVE	It's hilarious. GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.
M	CLIVE	What? CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
M	PAT (O.S.)	Here it comes! GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
F	PAT	Okay then, beers for you gentleman. A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space. The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.
F	PAT	So, where you boys headed?
M	JAKE	We're heading into Utah. Do ourselves some hunting.
M	GUS	Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps in front of the bangstick, right Jake? They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
M	JAKE	You got that right, Gus.
F	PAT	Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts up quite a fight.
M	GUS	That's what we're counting on. They nudge each other and laugh.
F	PAT	I better make you something good and hot. Long way to The Beehive. PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
M	CLIVE	What took you so long?
M	GRAHAM	I was putting the sticker on.
M	CLIVE	They were an odd pair, weren't they?
M	GRAHAM	Definitely didn't speak Bocci. CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	That wasn't their truck was it?
M	CLIVE	No.
M	GRAHAM	What's the matter?
M	CLIVE	Nothing. How we doing?
M	GRAHAM	We should be just about there. They scan the roadside for a few seconds.
M	CLIVE	I've found it.
M	GRAHAM	Where? The Black Mailbox. GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
M	CLIVE	It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here.
M	GRAHAM	Area 51.
M	CLIVE	Dreamland.
M	GRAHAM	The Groom Lake Military Test Facility.
M	CLIVE	MacArthur's Black Mile.
M	GRAHAM	Is that a real one?
M	CLIVE	No, I made it up myself.
M	GRAHAM	I like it.
M	CLIVE	Be great if we saw something.
M	GRAHAM	Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft.
M	CLIVE	That would be incredible. It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast. Whoosh.
M	GRAHAM	What would you do if they actually landed?
M	CLIVE	Keep it together. First contact is a big responsibility. They come in peace, we go to pieces? That's not how I roll. CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.
M	CLIVE	What's wrong? GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.
M	GRAHAM	It's them. They found us. I don't know how but they found us.
M	CLIVE	Who? Who's found us?
M	GRAHAM	The Libyans!
M	CLIVE	Run for it Marty! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.
M	GRAHAM	Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps whoever it was turned doff.
M	CLIVE	Of course it's them. We're dead. It's like Deliverance. They're going to rape us and break our arms.
M	GRAHAM	I don't want my arms broken!
M	CLIVE	There's only one thing for it.
M	GRAHAM	What?
M	CLIVE	I'm gonna have to fly blind. CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
M	CLIVE	Probably best not to do that. I couldn't really see anything. They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
M	CLIVE	Oh God, oh God, oh God.
M	GRAHAM	I need the toilet.
M	CLIVE	Me too. The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.
M	CLIVE	They're trying to overtake.
M	GRAHAM	Don't let them get past.
M	CLIVE	Should I ram them?
M	GRAHAM	What about the deposit? CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
M	CLIVE	It wasn't them. The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
M	CLIVE	We should see if they're okay.
M	GRAHAM	I still need a wee.
M	CLIVE	I can hold mine. GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
M	GRAHAM	The bulb's gone in there.
M	CLIVE	Hello? They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.
M	GRAHAM	Maybe you should call for help. GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	I wouldn't do that if I were you. GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
M	CLIVE	I rather think these men need help. Graham, give me the phone. GRAHAM passes the phone over.
M	VOICE	Seriously, I wouldn't do that. GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
M	OPERATOR	911 Emergency. How may I direct your call? Hello? Hello? GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
M	ALIEN	Put - the phone - down. Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
M	GRAHAM	What have you done to him?
M	ALIEN	I didn't do anything. He fainted.
M	GRAHAM	Yes but you made him faint.
M	ALIEN	I did not. Okay I did, but it's not like i set my phaser to "Faint'.
M	GRAHAM	You've got a phaser!?
M	ALIEN	No! Look, I need you to help. Can you get this guy back onto your wagon?
M	GRAHAM	Are you going to probe us?
M	ALIEN	No! Where does that come from? Why do people always assume we want to stick something up their ass?
M	GRAHAM	Don't you?
M	ALIEN	No. There's certainly nothing about it in the encounter manual. As a rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe people find it easier to deal with earthly transgressions if they suppress it with absurd fantasies about alien probing.
M	GRAHAM	What?
M	ALIEN	It's just a theory. Listen, focus okay? I promise you I won't hurt you, I just need your help.
M	GRAHAM	You need my help?
M	ALIEN	Yes.
M	GRAHAM	How come I can understand you? Are you using some sort of neural language router?
M	ALIEN	No, I'm speaking English you prick. Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your name?
M	GRAHAM	Graham Willy.
M	ALIEN	What about him?
M	GRAHAM	That's the writer, Clive Gollings.
M	ALIEN	Well, let's get Clive into the RV and get going. I'll explain everything on the way. Please.
M	GRAHAM	Where are we going?
M	ALIEN	North.
M	GRAHAM	The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.
M	ALIEN	Well, then we're gonna have to hustle, aren't we?
M	ALIEN	Look Graham, you're just gonna have to trust me, okay? GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
M	ALIEN	Please man, I need you. GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.
M	GRAHAM	Okay then.
M	ALIEN	Great. Thank you.
M	GRAHAM	What's your name?
M	ALIEN	I'm Paul.
M	GRAHAM	Paul?
M	PAUL	Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off MacArthur's Black Mile. They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Oh man, has he...?
M	GRAHAM	I told him he should have gone.
M	PAUL	Could have been worse. Know what I'm saying? They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
M	PAUL	Can I have this ham?
M	GRAHAM	Uh... yes.
M	PAUL	Great! PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
M	GRAHAM	Paul? Where am I going again?
M	PAUL	I told you, North. Do you have a map? GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.
M	PAUL	Not when we're driving, Graham. The map disappears back up into the roller.
M	GRAHAM	Sorry.
M	PAUL	Just head North. We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them.
M	GRAHAM	Them? Who's them?
M	CAPTAIN	Sir?
M	ZOIL	Talk to me.
M	CAPTAIN	Three survivors, company men, hurt but alive.
M	ZOIL	Anyone else?
M	CAPTAIN	No sir. ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.
M	CAPTAIN	What's this? The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
M	CAPTAIN	What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?
M	ZOIL	No. It's neither of those things. He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
M	VOICE	What's the situation?
M	ZOIL	We have a guest who's left the hotel without paying, sir.
M	VOICE	Damn it! Do you think he's "left' left?
M	ZOIL	Doubtful. NORAD would have picked up a bogie. Those guys can track Santa. No sir, he's still here. Question is, for how long?
M	VOICE	Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence?
M	ZOIL	How so?
M	VOICE	I signed the red document this morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's odd that he chooses today to go AWOL? How did he know?
M	ZOIL	Are you suggesting he has someone on the inside.
M	VOICE	Maybe.
M	ZOIL	Well he's definitely got someone on the outside.
M	VOICE	What?
M	ZOIL	Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks... among other things. I'd bet my left nut that little bastard's hitched a ride.
M	VOICE	Lock down the area. Road blocks, spot checks, the whole nine yards. You're going to handle this personally, Zoil. I want this wrapped up before Letterman. CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
M	PAUL	The bulb's gone in there. CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
M	PAUL	I hate it when you get the closed ones, right?
M	GRAHAM	I usually bite them open.
M	PAUL	Are you fucking insane? You gotta tap "em and if they don't open you throw them away.
M	GRAHAM	That's molluscs.
M	PAUL	Shut up.
M	GRAHAM	It's true. Hello Clive! How are you feeling?
M	CLIVE	I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL MAD, Graham. If that is your name? You're happily sitting there chatting to... to... that, like it's the most natural thing in the world. The two of you laughing away like you haven't seen each other since 1990. PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.
M	CLIVE (CONT'D)	So forgive me if I seem a little rattled but from where I'm standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form.
M	GRAHAM	His name is Paul.
M	CLIVE	Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul Reiser?
M	PAUL	Just Paul. You know, like Madonna or Dracula.
M	GRAHAM	Paul's from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.
M	CLIVE	No he is not!
M	PAUL	I am man, seriously.
M	CLIVE	How could he possibly have travelled that distance?
M	PAUL	Wormhole.
M	CLIVE	Balls! Graham, this isn't what it seems. What about Ocham's Razor?
M	GRAHAM	The hairdressers?
M	CLIVE	Yes, the old man who owns it told me that, in unbelievable circumstances, the most plausible explanation is usually the truth.
M	PAUL	And what's the most plausible explanation, Clive?
M	CLIVE	That you're a thin midget in an alien costume.
M	PAUL	There's no such thing as a thin midget? Those guys are built. Have you not seen The Station Agent?
M	GRAHAM	He's right. I think that's less believable than Paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy. Oh really? With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
M	PAUL	Ow! Get off me!
M	CLIVE	You're not real. You're not real!
M	GRAHAM	Excuse me.
M	PAUL	Get off me, you fucking psycho! CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
M	CLIVE	Oh shit! CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
M	CLIVE	Where's he gone?
M	GRAHAM	Maybe he beamed up.
M	CLIVE	As if. We would have seen the classic shimmer and hum.
M	GRAHAM	Good point. GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.
M	AGENT 1	Where you boys from? Australia?
M	CLIVE	Britain.
M	AGENT 1	Ah. G'day mate. The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.
M	AGENT 1	Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?
M	CLIVE/GRAHAM	Comic-con.
M	AGENT 1	You're a long way from San Diego.
M	CLIVE	We were having a little drive.
M	AGENT 1	Is that right?
M	AGENT 2 (O.S.)	Hey Haggard?!
M	HAGGARD	Yeah? O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.
M	O'REILLY	These guys have met Michael Biehn.
M	HAGGARD	No shit! How was he?
M	CLIVE	He was a good egg.
M	GRAHAM	Very unaffected.
M	HAGGARD	That's nice to hear. O'Reilly? Anything else?
M	O'REILLY	Just some pissy jeans. HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
M	HAGGARD	Okay, you guys can go.
M	CLIVE	Thank you. May I ask what you're searching for?
M	HAGGARD	Of course you may. There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.
M	CLIVE	Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it?
M	GRAHAM	Is it?
M	CLIVE	Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it?
M	GRAHAM	I suppose so.
M	CLIVE	Than that's what happened. PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.
M	CLIVE	Where the hell did you go?
M	PAUL	Nowhere.
M	GRAHAM	What, you went invisible?
M	PAUL	It's not invisibility per so. It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure.
M	GRAHAM	Like Predator?
M	PAUL	Exactly.
M	GRAHAM	Can you do it whenever you want? Anytime...
M	CLIVE	No thank you.
M	PAUL	You sure? How about a cup of coffee? Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice cuppa J. PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
M	PAUL	Hey, look who's up!
M	GRAHAM	Hello Paul. GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.
M	GRAHAM	What's the matter?
M	CLIVE	Graham, there is a Grey in the galley, making me coffee.
M	GRAHAM	Did you want tea?
M	CLIVE	No, I don't want tea.
M	GRAHAM	Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't it?
M	CLIVE	No, what's wried, Graham, is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it!
M	GRAHAM	He needs our help, Clive. PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their
M	PAUL CLIVE	You got it? Yes I've got it.
M	PAUL CLIVE	Thank you. GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and
M	PAUL	Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you. Am i right? CLIVE doesn't deny it.
M	PAUL	And I appreciate the fact that I have somewhat gate-crashed the party here but, truth be told, I'm in a hell of a pickle. I really need your help.
M	CLIVE	Why us?
M	PAUL	Why not? CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.
M	CLIVE	What about the RV? It has to be back in two days.
M	GRAHAM	Clive, he's an alien. A living, breathing, alien. CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand
M	CLIVE	I suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension. PAUL looks super-pleased.
M	CLIVE	How did you get here?
M	PAUL	Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.
M	GRAHAM	Happens to the best of us.
M	PAUL	Also, I'm a shit driver.
M	CLIVE	Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!
M	PAUL	Roswell was a smoke-screen man, designed to distract from the truth.
M	CLIVE	They invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash?
M	PAUL	I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?
M	CLIVE	What have you been doing here all this time?
M	PAUL	Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting the shit. Advising the government.
M	GRAHAM	Not just the government. A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and
M	STEVEN SPIELBERG	...I want him to have some kind of special power, you know? Something sort of messianic...
M	PAUL	How about molecular revivification.
M	STEVEN SPIELBERG	I don't know what that is.
M	PAUL	Restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory.
M	STEVEN SPIELBERG	I...uh...
M	PAUL	Healing, Steven.
M	STEVEN SPIELBERG	Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort of thing? His little finger could light up at the end and-
M	PAUL	You know what? Sometimes, less is more. The line beeps.
M	STEVEN SPIELBERG	You got another call?
M	PAUL	Yeah I gotta take this man. It's the fucking V guys again.
M	PAUL	Right.
M	GRAHAM	You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture generally over the last 60 years. How come you know so much?
M	GRAHAM	We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious. CLIVE looks miffed.
M	GRAHAM	...while you were asleep.
M	PAUL	You want a bagel Clive?
M	CLIVE	No thanks.
M	PAUL	Graham?
M	GRAHAM	Yes please.
M	CLIVE	Go on then, I'll have half.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	You want anything on it?
M	CLIVE	Jam. What?
M	CLIVE	Jelly.
M	PAUL	Gotcha. PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.
M	GRAHAM	I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up.
M	CLIVE	Thank you. So, do you know where we're going?
M	GRAHAM	Just North. He said we had to make a right at Utah.
M	CLIVE	Why can't he tell us?
M	GRAHAM	He said it was a surprise.
M	CLIVE	Do you trust him, Graham? I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider?
M	GRAHAM	Strider, definitely.
M	CLIVE	You'd better be right. I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus.
M	GRAHAM	It's okay, he doesn't do that. PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.
M	PAUL	Bagel time! The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.
M	GRAHAM	Fuel level's critical.
M	PAUL	Sorry, I had a warning light just like that on my ship.
M	GRAHAM	For fuel?
M	PAUL	Anti-grav failure. CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.
M	CLIVE	There's a place called Ely five miles from here. It's small but there should be a gas station.
M	GRAHAM	Roger that, number one. CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
M	CLIVE	Paul, don't do that!
M	PAUL	Here's what I need. Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas.
M	CLIVE	You know this is a gas station? PAUL looks disappointed.
M	CLIVE	Ready?
M	GRAHAM	Ready. HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	Get me some more peanut M&Ms.; GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE
M	STATE TROOPER	After you.
M	CLIVE	Thanks.
M	O'REILLY	Coming... ready or not! O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
M	ZOIL	Orange?
M	O'REILLY	No thanks.
M	ZOIL	Nice and juicy.
M	O'REILLY	I don't want to spoil breakfast.
M	ZOIL	Do you mind telling me what's going on, Agent?
M	O'REILLY	Just keeping ourselves occupied sir. Things are pretty slow.
M	ZOIL	Where's the other one?
M	O'REILLY	I don't know, let's see. Haggard? HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on
M	HAGGARD	Sorry, I was just... hiding.
M	ZOIL	I see. You fellas had much traffic through here?
M	HAGGARD	Just a big RV driven by a couple of nerds.
M	ZOIL	Nerds, huh?
M	HAGGARD	Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and met Michael Biehn.
M	ZOIL	I've heard he's nice.
M	HAGGARD	Good egg.
M	O'REILLY	Very unaffected.
M	ZOIL	Did you search the vehicle thoroughly?
M	O'REILLY	Yes sir.
M	ZOIL	Find anything?
M	O'REILLY	Not really. Just Michael Biehn's autograph and some pissy jeans. Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.
M	ZOIL	Did you get the license plate? HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.
M	ZOIL	Make? More sheepishness.
M	HAGGARD	It was big.
M	ZOIL	I want everything you can remember. Descriptions of the occupants, height, hair, distinguishing features. We can do it on the way.
M	HAGGARD	On the way?
M	ZOIL	You're coming with me.
M	O'REILLY	What about the road block sir?
M	ZOIL	It didn't work.
M	CLIVE	Don't you think that's a bit much? Put it all back. Except the burrito... and the doughnuts... and the chocolate milk. Let's just pay for it and leave.
M	GRAHAM	We need bulb for the toilet.
M	CLIVE	Essential only, Graham! They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.
M	STATE TROOPER	Morning Chris!
M	CHRIS	Hey Dean.
M	STATE TROOPER	Who do you think I had in my office this morning?
M	CHRIS	Jeremy Piven?
M	STATE TROOPER	No. The Secret Service. GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it
M	CHRIS	They find out how you can afford a Dodge Viper on troopers pay?
M	STATE TROOPER	Not yet. They're all over this crash on the road up to Rachel.
M	CHRIS	What you think's going on?
M	STATE TROOPER	Don't know, could be Muslims.
M	CHRIS	Jesus Cheeerist! CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.
M	STATE TROOPER	You go right ahead.
M	CLIVE	Thank you very much, officer.
M	STATE TROOPER	Where're you guys from?
M	GRAHAM	Britain.
M	STATE TROOPER	Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!
M	CHRIS	No guns? Jesus Cheeerist. CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER
M	POLICE CONTROLLER	All units, be on the lookout for a cream and brown Recreational Vehicle, no plate number at this time. Officers are advised to contain but not board. Dean, if you still at Gas and Go, bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes? Dean? GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.
M	CLIVE	It's find for you. You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay. PAUL laughs.
M	CLIVE	Why's everything so funny? They think we're Muslims.
M	PAUL	That's their excuse for everything. There are worse things you can be. We had a Muslim guy at the base. Systems analyst called Yusef. We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights. You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum.
M	CLIVE	Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV.
M	PAUL	We're hardly the only RV on the road. Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey. BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.
M	PAUL	Fuck, that made me jump.
M	CLIVE	Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.
M	PAUL	What a waste.
M	GRAHAM	Poor thing.
M	CLIVE	Nothing anyone could've done. PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.
M	GRAHAM	What are you doing? PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
M	GRAHAM	It's a miracle! PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.
M	PAUL	I'll miss these.
M	CLIVE	Why would you do that?
M	PAUL	I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am
M	STATE TROOPER	By the time I got the bulletin, they were long gone. Seemed like nice fellas to me.
M	CHRIS	Is it true they was Muslims?
M	STATE TROOPER	They said they were British.
M	ZOIL	I think you can be both.
M	CHRIS	Jesus Cheeeeerist!
M	HAGGARD	Agent Zoil?
M	ZOIL	Excuse me gentlemen. ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The
M	VOICE	Report.
M	ZOIL	We've tracked them down to a gas station in Ely.
M	VOICE	So why am I not witting with my feet up, smoking a jay, watching Erin Brockovich?
M	ZOIL	We think he may be travelling in an RV with two British men sir.
M	VOICE	Goddamnit, I knew we should have gone ahead with invasion in "44. What are they, MI6?
M	ZOIL	No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on the lamb from Comic-Con.
M	VOICE	Shit. My sister's kid went to that. Little Manga faggot.
M	ZOIL	I still think this stinks, sir.
M	VOICE	Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much of a coincidence. He sits tight for 60 years and then suddenly now he decides to take off. If he wanted to go home so bad, he could've just given us the slip when he was playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.
M	ZOIL	Someone must have told him. We need to find the rat.
M	VOICE	Leave that to me. In the meantime, if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M. then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a new A. O.K.?
M	ZOIL	Yes sir.
M	GRAHAM	What do you think?
M	PAUL	Ask me when I've finished it. CLIDE rubs his yes.
M	GRAHAM	You tired, Sausage? Don't call me Sausage in front of him.
M	GRAHAM	Sorry. Are you tired though?
M	CLIVE	Mummy, I am bushed.
M	GRAHAM	What do you need?
M	CLIVE	Best case, I'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal.
M	GRAHAM	I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still call you Big-Rig can't I?
M	CLIVE	Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck with an RV park? We need somewhere off the beaten track, n'est pas?
M	GRAHAM	Roger that. Cup of Joe?
M	CLIVE	You read my mind. GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
M	CLIVE	Can I help you?
M	PAUL	You want a cigarette?
M	CLIVE	No, thank you. I don't smoke. PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.
M	PAUL	Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating the bird. CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
M	GRAHAM	Honey Bun?
M	CLIVE	Could you unwrap it for me?
M	GRAHAM	By your command. GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL
M	PAUL	Let me ask you something. Are you to...?
M	CLIVE	What?
M	PAUL	You know... PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
M	CLIVE	No!
M	PAUL	Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's "bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.
M	CLIVE	What are you trying to say?
M	PAUL	Maybe you should start smoking.
M	CLIVE	Great find, Graham.
M	GRAHAM	I sourced a website listing off the beaten track, North American RV parks.
M	PAUL	I really lucked out with you nerds, didn't I? GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed
M	GRAHAM	It's awfully quiet.
M	CLIVE	Just the way we like it. PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
M	CLIVE	Stop doing that!
M	GRAHAM	Someone's coming. PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.
M	VOICE	Hello?
M	CLIVE	We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.
M	GRAHAM	I don't think she heard you.
M	CLIVE	I was talking to you.
M	GRAHAM	Oh, sorry.
M	VOICE	Hello? GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
F	RUTH	Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.
M	CLIVE	Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come in?
F	RUTH	Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an I'll need to hang onto an ID too. CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.
M	GRAHAM	We're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.
F	RUTH	Where you heading next?
M	GRAHAM	Uh, east... apparently. CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.
F	RUTH	England?
M	CLIVE	Yes. London.
F	RUTH	I love London.
M	CLIVE	Have you been?
F	RUTH	No. Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	Yes.
F	RUTH	Oh. I'd love to go someday.
M	GRAHAM	You should. There's lots a places I wanna go. Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The world's a big place. I need one of these though.
M	CLIVE	You don't have a passport? RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry
F	RUTH	That's my father. I'll come over and take your money in the morning. Have a pleasant night now, won't you? RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM
M	CLIVE	Doors to manual and cross check. Graham? Graham?
M	GRAHAM	Hmmm? PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	What took you so long?
F	RUTH	I was just talking. RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	You talk to much.
F	RUTH	Sorry Papa.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	How long they staying?
F	RUTH	Just the night I think Hook ups?
F	RUTH	Uh-huh.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	Where they headed?
F	RUTH	East.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	Them California plates I saw?
F	RUTH	Yes, but they're from London.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	London, Ohio?
F	RUTH	No, London, England.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	Where?!
F	RUTH	England, Papa. It's in North Western Europe. The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands
M	MOSES BEHE	Europe? I'll give you Europe, missy. Now, get and make my supper. MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.
M	PAUL	Arrghh, what the fuck?!
M	GRAHAM	Hungry?
M	PAUL	I ate already. GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.
M	PAUL	Too soon? They nod.
M	PAUL	Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break bread with you guys. What are we having? GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.
M	GRAHAM	Willies! PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.
M	CLIVE	I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's my forte. CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
M	PAUL	Hello Clive. From the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue, am I do assume you're a Hendrix fan?
M	CLIVE	I am actually, yes.
M	PAUL	I met him once.
M	CLIVE	Really?
M	PAUL	Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He thought I was a hallucination. Shame what happened to him.
M	CLIVE	All the good ones die.
M	PAUL	Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases album seventeen. PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.
M	CLIVE	So you've been here for 60 years?
M	PAUL	I know, right? Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation.
M	CLIVE	Why did you come to earth?
M	PAUL	I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force.
M	CLIVE	What?!
M	PAUL	I'm fucking with you, man. I was on a science mission actually. Meteorological reconnaissance. We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets. My specialist subject is tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52.
M	PAUL	No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit. It's another "clever subterfuge." GRAHAM joins them with the food.
M	PAUL	Just telling him about Area 52.
M	GRAHAM	Ha ha yeah.
M	PAUL	So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing.
M	CLIVE	Mulder was right!
M	PAUL	Mulder was my idea. They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.
M	CLIVE	Would you like a go? PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the RUTH backs away into the shadows.
M	CLIVE	Who is it?
M	RUTH (O.S.)	It's Ruth. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
F	RUTH	Good morning.
M	CLIVE	Good morning.
F	RUTH	May I come in?
M	GRAHAM	Yes. CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as
F	RUTH	Was everything to your liking?
M	CLIVE	Yes, thank you.
F	RUTH	Where's the other one?
M	CLIVE	The other one?
F	RUTH	It's okay, we don't charge by the person. That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right?
M	CLIVE	Oh the other one. Um...
M	PAUL	I'm in the can. I ate a closed mollusc. PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
M	GRAHAM	I like your shirt. The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
F	RUTH	Thanks. I got it at my church.
M	GRAHAM	Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin? Because of his theories. Are you men of God?
M	GRAHAM	Would you like a coffee?
M	CLIVE	I suppose we're men of science. RUTH narrow her eye.
M	CLIVE	If we believe in anything it would be macro evolution. Cause and effect. The establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos. RUTH looks scandalized.
M	GRAHAM	Or it could be God. You just don't know do you?
F	RUTH	God created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested. PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.
M	CLIVE	Did you know that the universe has been dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy?
M	GRAHAM	Yes.
M	CLIVE	Not you!
F	RUTH	The world is 4000 years old.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	Oh come on! Horseshit! RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
F	RUTH	Explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	Oh, don't give me that old irreducible complexity crap-
F	RUTH	They eye is comprised of three interacting parts. Remove any one of them and it ceases to exist. It has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and, when the good Lord permits, it works in perfect harmony with its environment. Something as functionally perfect as that doesn't just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	But it didn't just occur did it? It is the culmination of millions of years of development across countless species.
F	RUTH	What are you talking about?
M	PAUL (O.S.)	Evolution baby. RUTH screams and bangs the door.
F	RUTH	It'd design! If He designed it, why didn't He just make it one part and take the whole weekend off?
F	RUTH	Nothing you can so or do can shake my belief, or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that God made Heaven and earth and created us all in His own image.
M	PAUL	Oh yeah? Well then how do you explain me? RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
M	PAUL	And that's Jenga.
M	CLIVE	What did you do that for?
M	PAUL	I didn't do anything, she fainted.
M	CLIVE	She saw you!
M	PAUL	Oh come on. Who's gonna believe anything she says?
M	CLIVE	The authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing.
M	PAUL	What, a delusional, one-eyed God botherer?
M	CLIVE	Paul, right now they're going to follow any lead they can get.
M	PAUL	I didn't think of that.
M	GRAHAM	We could take her with us.
M	PAUL/CLIVE	What?
M	GRAHAM	We're only going to be a couple of days. We could let her go once Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll be fine once she gets to know us. PAUL and CLIVE consider this.
M	CLIVE	How am I going to get my passport back? PAUL vanishes.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	Leave it to me.
M	PAUL	Hallelujah. Ruth, what in the Lord's name- MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for
M	PAUL	Boo? The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM
M	GRAHAM	Hi.
F	RUTH	Where am I? PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.
M	PAUL	Hey, look who's up.
M	GRAHAM	Would you like a cup of tea? RUTH starts to pray furiously.
M	GRAHAM	I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth. We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. We were just a little concerned that you might call the police.
F	RUTH	You have been deceived. Deceived by an agent of Satan himself.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	You know I'm sitting right here?
M	GRAHAM	He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. He's not evil. He's just very rude.
F	RUTH	How can he be from another world? There is only one world. Our world, created by God the Father. PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.
M	PAUL	Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone.
F	RUTH	How could that possibly make me feel any better?
M	PAUL	Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice!
M	GRAHAM	I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world.
F	RUTH	This isn't happening! You're a hallucination. You're not real. You're a test. A test from God.
M	PAUL	You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
M	CLIVE	I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances.
M	GRAHAM	No!
M	PAUL	Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
M	GRAHAM	What did you do to her?!
M	PAUL	I broadened her horizons.
M	GRAHAM	Can you broaden mine?
M	PAUL	No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.
M	GRAHAM	Oh please.
M	PAUL	Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
M	CLIVE	Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable.
M	PAUL	Can't I just tell you?
M	CLIVE	No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps Maybe I should make that tea?
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	I didn't call the government. I called the po-lice.
M	ZOIL	Given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us.
M	MOSES BEHE	And who are you?
M	ZOIL	Secret Service, sir.
M	MOSES BEHE	I knew it. You know that devil took my Ruth.
M	ZOIL	And Ruth's your daughter?
M	MOSES BEHE	That's right. Her Mama died when she was born. I good as brought her up by myself. Wasn't easy either. Two mouths to feed and this place to run.
M	ZOIL	I understand. Do you have a photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe? MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered
M	ZOIL	She's pretty. MOSES snorts.
M	ZOIL	Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In case she tries to contact you.
M	MOSES BEHE	I do... ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his
M	MOSES BEHE	...and she'll call me if she can. Ruth's never really been outta Carbon County.
M	ZOIL	You say they went East?
M	MOSES BEHE	Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge if they ain't using the interstate, there's been a rig spill just South of Dutch John.
M	ZOIL	So?
M	MOSES BEHE	So that means they'll be on the 44. Only way to go. ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.
M	ZOIL	Let's go. Haggard!
M	MOSES BEHE	Tell me you're gonna kill that thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what it is.
M	ZOIL	We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.
M	MOSES BEHE	Watch yourself now. I seen its eyes. It's evil. ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.
M	MOSES BEHE	God's speed, Mr. Zoil.
M	HAGGARD (O.S.)	Man, that way was one fat freak!
M	O'REILLY (O.S.)	If I was that girl, I think I'd rather take my chances with the alien. HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.
M	ZOIL	Can it, you two! How many times do I have to tell you?
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	We do not refer to the target as "The Alien'. MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.
M	PAUL	Wow. Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,
M	PAUL	There it is, boys. Wyoming.
M	CLIVE	Is that where we're going?
M	PAUL	Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something. I mean look at it. Hey Ruth, get up here. They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.
M	PAUL	Ruth!?
M	CLIVE	Someone should go after her. Graham? CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.
M	CLIVE	Graham!?
M	GRAHAM	Ruth!
F	RUTH	Leave me alone!
M	GRAHAM	Ruth, please stop, I've got shin splints. RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.
M	GRAHAM	Are you alright?
F	RUTH	He can't be from space. It's not possible.
M	GRAHAM	Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's not just possible, it's probably. There's probably millions of intelligent civilizations.
F	RUTH	So, where is everybody?
M	GRAHAM	Well, one of them is right there. RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the
F	RUTH	Everything I've ever been told is a lie. My purpose. My truth. All false. DO you know how that feels? To suddenly have nothing?
M	GRAHAM	Just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, Ruth.
F	RUTH	Huh?
M	GRAHAM	I understand you're probably feeling very confused right now. Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security. To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant.
F	RUTH	I do feel lonely and unimportant! How can this all be an accident? It doesn't make sense. Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth? GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.
F	RUTH	How can that be an accident.
M	GRAHAM	It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it probably is. That's the beauty of the universe.
F	RUTH	But what's the point? If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living?
M	GRAHAM	This is the point, Ruth. Right now. This conversation. That tree, your next cheeseburger. Life is a miracle. People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon.
F	RUTH	Huh?
M	GRAHAM	Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.'
F	RUTH	Huh?
M	GRAHAM	It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn. We still have life to live.
F	RUTH	I'm frightened.
M	GRAHAM	So am I, but it passes, sort of. Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us. I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV, you might just find the very thing you're looking for.
F	RUTH	I... I'm not sure.
M	GRAHAM	I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I can honestly say, I have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing.
F	RUTH	That's so sweet. GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.
M	GRAHAM	She's going to be fine. I think your hair looks good by the way. You look like Storm.
F	RUTH	Who's Storm?
M	PAUL	From X-Men.
M	GRAHAM	Exactly. RUTH goes to the bathroom. PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
M	CLIVE	Small corrections! Small corrections! RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.
M	PAUL	11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on! It's fun. We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the
F	RUTH	This is the furthest I've ever been.
F	RUTH	You don't mind, do you, Graham?
M	GRAHAM	It looks nice.
M	PAUL	Hey, we should stop for something to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?
F	RUTH	What?
M	CLIVE	I'm hungry.
M	PAUL	What's new, fatty?
M	CLIVE	Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I happen to be very strong. PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits
M	PAUL	Pick that up then.
M	CLIVE	So childish.
F	RUTH	Maybe I should call Papa.
M	PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE	What?!
F	RUTH	Look, I've been missing for a whole day. If he's called the police, they'll be looking for us and if they find us, this "amazing adventure' is going to come to an end real quick. I just need to tell him I'm fine and that I'll be back soon, okay? PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.
M	PAUL	Right up top! RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.
M	PAUL	Too soon? CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.
M	CLIVE	I did it!
M	CLIVE	Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk to anyone unless you have to and try to look inconspicuous. Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.
M	CLIVE	I wish he'd stop doing that! They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln
F	RUTH	I won't be long.
M	CLIVE	We'll order food and wait for you at the bar.
F	RUTH	Okay.
M	CLIVE	Be careful. RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she
M	MOSES BEHE	Tap water.
M	OPERATOR (O.S.)	Ruth Behe?
F	RUTH	Yes?
M	OPERATOR (O.S.)	Please hold, your call is being diverted.
F	RUTH	Wait, I...
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	Ruth Behe?
F	RUTH	Yes?
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen very carefully. You're in great danger.
F	RUTH	How did you...?
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	We know who you're travelling with Ruth. I need you and your friend to turn yourselves in.
F	RUTH	What if we don't want to turn ourselves in?
M	ZOIL	Where are you? Where are you headed? I don't know.
M	ZOIL	Look, I know you think you're doing the right thing but I promise you, I'm only thinking about you. And Paul. You care about Paul, don't you?
M	RUTH (O.S.)	I don't know how I feel about him. He's weird and also, rude.
M	ZOIL	Yes he is.
M	RUTH (O.S.)	I asked him why he wore shorts and he said if he didn't I'd see his big spaceman balls.
F	RUTH	Who's there with you?
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	Ruth, please listen to me. Your father is worried about you. We want to get you home. I need you to tell me where you are.
F	RUTH	He showed me things.
M	ZOIL	You're not still talking about his balls, are you?
F	RUTH	I... i just want to know what's real. I'm confused. I... I... RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	Damnit, Haggard! RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she
M	JAKE	Hey, slow down there cyclops.
F	RUTH	I need to get to my friends.
M	GUS	Why the hurry? You know I got a friend with one eye who'd love to meet you.
F	RUTH	I happen to have two eyes actually. I just have a severe stigmatism.
M	JAKE	You should get that fixed up. Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the right light.
M	GUS	Yeah, the dark.
F	RUTH	Papa said the Lord would fix it.
M	GUS	The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing sweetheart.
F	RUTH	No shit. RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles
M	GRAHAM	How's your dad?
F	RUTH	We need to leave now.
M	CLIVE	We're still waiting on a wet fries. The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.
M	JAKE	Holy shit! It's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile!
M	CLIVE	Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps we can exchange insurance details?
M	JAKE	I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.
M	GUS	These the "friends' you told us about, baby?
F	RUTH	Yes, they are.
M	JAKE	Well whaddya know? Small world.
F	RUTH	We were just leaving.
M	GUS	I don't think so. JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.
M	GRAHAM	Leave her alone!
M	JAKE	What did you say?
M	CLIVE	He said, leave her alone. At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a
M	CLIVE	Graham?
M	MOSES BEHE	I'm taking you home.
F	RUTH	I... I can't.
M	MOSES BEHE	Don't talk back to me, girl! A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
F	RUTH	What about Papa?!
M	JAKE	Hey, we ain't finished with you.
M	CLIVE	Graham, take Ruth into the RV and lock the door. I don't want either of you to see this. CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
M	PAUL	Yo fucknuts! The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
M	PAUL	So, who wants to get probed first? The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.
M	GRAHAM	Ha! Only one of us fainted!
M	PAUL	Tell me you got the food? CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
F	RUTH	It's them.
M	GRAHAM	Who?
F	RUTH	It wasn't my fault. They answered the phone. He knew all about us.
M	CLIVE	Who? Who are you talking about?
M	PAUL	Get in the RV!
M	GRAHAM	Was that your dad, Ruth? RUTH nods.
M	CLIVE	He was so angry.
F	RUTH	He's always angry. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.
M	GRAHAM	Are you alright, Ruth? RUTH nods, still distant.
M	PAUL	I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone wanna take a walk?
M	CLIVE	I'm game.
M	GRAHAM	You want to come for a walk, Ruth?
F	RUTH	Thanks, but I think I'm going to turn in. It's been a long day what with meeting you guys, being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question.
M	PAUL	Sorry about that.
M	GRAHAM	It was amazing though, wasn't it? Remember when Paul said "Yo fucknuts'? That was brilliant.
M	PAUL	You gotta talk the talk, right?
M	CLIVE	What about when I got smacked in the nose?
M	PAUL	Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You want anything Ruth?
F	RUTH	No, you go, I'll be fine. Here Clive. RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
M	CLIVE	Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.
M	GRAHAM	You can sleep in my bunk if you'd like. She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.
M	GRAHAM	I'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. I've had a cold.
M	PAUL	Hey Graham. Check this out. What d'ya think? PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
M	PAUL	I'd look pretty hot, right?
M	GRAHAM	Space cowboy.
M	PAUL	Steve Miller Band. I love that song. Speaking of midnight tokers, I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. Do you guys partake?
M	GRAHAM	No.
M	PAUL	Shame. I get it from the military. This is the shit that killed Dylan.
M	GRAHAM	Bob Dylan's still alive.
M	PAUL	Is he? CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.
M	CLIVE	Let's party!
M	GRAHAM	So why "Paul'? It's not very, you know, alien.
M	CLIVE	Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something?
M	PAUL	No.
M	GRAHAM	P-o-o-u-r-l?
M	PAUL	No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel.
M	CLIVE	Paul Simon.
M	PAUL	Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given.
M	GRAHAM	What's your real name?
M	PAUL	You won't be able to pronounce it.
M	CLIVE	I can speak Klingon.
M	PAUL	What a geek.
M	CLIVE	Hey!
M	GRAHAM	Come on, what's your real name. PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.
M	PAUL	Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
M	CLIVE	Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.
M	PAUL	That's pretty good.
M	GRAHAM	Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.
M	PAUL	Fuck you!
M	CLIVE	Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.
M	GRAHAM	You look like a poster on a student's wall.
M	PAUL	That was my gag! "Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime.
M	GRAHAM	You never answered my question. Why Paul? Who called you Paul?
M	PAUL	The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying "Paul? Paul?" It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name.
M	CLIVE	She called her dog Paul?
M	PAUL	Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.
M	GRAHAM	What happened to the little girl?
M	PAUL	Who knows? Never saw her again. Think about her everyday though. PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
M	CLIVE	It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we? It's a bit of an anti-climax.
M	PAUL	Thanks a bunch, Hurley.
M	CLIVE	I don't mean that in a bad way. They all scratch their noses.
M	GRAHAM	Paul, can I ask you something?
M	PAUL	Shoot.
M	GRAHAM	Why are you in such a hurry to leave?
M	PAUL	I've outlived my usefulness.
M	CLIVE	How so?
M	PAUL	There's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich. The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities.
M	GRAHAM	So?
M	PAUL	So the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells.
M	GRAHAM	So what, do they take a swab from your cheek?
M	PAUL	Negative.
M	CLIVE	Stool?
M	PAUL	Sadly, not that simple.
M	GRAHAM	Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.
M	PAUL	Believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me.
M	CLIVE	I don't follow.
M	PAUL	Stem cells are multipotent. GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.
M	PAUL	Lineage defined? GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	The camouflage response, the memory transfer, the revivification, they all originate in my cerebellum. In order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to...
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	Cut your brain out.
M	PAUL	Bingo! Fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun. So, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and I noticed the bumper sticker on your RV, I figured you might be sympathetic types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance.
M	CLIVE	I thought the crash was our fault.
M	PAUL	Well it was, kinda.
M	GRAHAM	So, you're saying if they catch you... PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
M	PAUL	So tell me, are you guys virgins or what?
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	No. They all cough.
M	PAUL	Alright then, Clive, when was the last time you got laid.
M	CLIVE	Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.
M	PAUL	Three years ago you had sex with a midget?
M	CLIVE	She was an Ewok! Sniff.
M	PAUL	There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume.
M	CLIVE	She was a midget.
M	PAUL	I can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature.
M	CLIVE	I know. I'm sorry.
M	PAUL	Was it nice?
M	PAUL	You sly dog! PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
M	PAUL	Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We fell asleep.
M	CLIVE	How did that happen?
M	PAUL	Sorry, I get this thing when I get high. It's called "projective empathy'. You feel what I feel.
M	GRAHAM	Like in E.T.?
M	PAUL	Exactly.
M	CLIVE	Oh, thank God. For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer. The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
M	GRAHAM	Oh dear!
M	PAUL	I can't walk through there.
M	CLIVE	How are we going to get back? Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.
M	GRAHAM	Maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family.
M	PAUL	That's great! Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy.
M	CLIVE	You could be a midget.
M	PAUL	You're obsessed with midgets! They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.
M	GRAHAM	Seem to be working, Clive. Clive? GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
M	GRAHAM	Clive, no. CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
M	GRAHAM	Now's not really the time, Sausage.
M	CLIVE	I must have it.
M	GRAHAM	It's very cheap. Are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on?
M	CLIVE	Oh, come on, we've got time.
F	RUTH	Where have you been? I was worried. She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.
M	ZOIL	Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we're currently looking for. May I ask, are you alone? RUTH pauses a second.
F	RUTH	Yes, I'm alone.
M	ZOIL	Do you mind taking a look at these pictures? ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
M	ZOIL	Do you recognise any of these people, Miss? She lingers on the picture of herself.
M	ZOIL	Miss?
F	RUTH	No, sorry I don't.
M	ZOIL	Where are you coming from, Ma'am?
F	RUTH	Christian ministry in Seattle. I've been driving for 5 days.
M	ZOIL	Going far?
F	RUTH	Austin.
M	ZOIL	Great town.
F	RUTH	Oh yes. It has an impressive bat population you know?
M	RUTH (CONT'D)	Folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out. Turn the sky black. Quite a sight.
M	ZOIL	Is that so?
F	RUTH	Uh-huh. Well, I really should be getting along.
M	ZOIL	Of course. Thanks for your time, Miss...? Beat.
F	RUTH	Darwin, Charlotte Darwin. ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.
M	PAUL	How's it going?
M	CHILD	Is that you?
M	PAUL	No.
M	CHILD	It looks like you.
M	PAUL	Suppose it does. What's your name?
M	CHILD	Keith Nash.
M	PAUL	I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you. They shake hands.
M	PAUL	You on your own here, Keith Nash?
M	KEITH NASH	My Mom's shopping for some new jeans. She lets me wait in here.
M	PAUL	Sounds like a good Mum.
M	KEITH NASH	Yes and no. What're you doing here?
M	PAUL	My friend's buying a sword. He's a grown man.
M	KEITH NASH	What a nerd. PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.
M	PAUL	You an M&Ms; man, Keith? PAUL produces his M&Ms.; He offers one to KEITH.
M	KEITH NASH	I am but I shouldn't.
M	PAUL	Strangers with candy, right?
M	KEITH NASH	Right.
M	PAUL	Well, we've got a lot in common. We both like comics and M&Ms.; Guess that makes us pals.
M	KEITH NASH	Guess so. KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms.; They turn their
M	PAUL	You read this one?
M	KEITH NASH	No.
M	PAUL	It's a good one. Take it. Go on. It's a gift.
M	KEITH NASH	Thanks Paul. KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
M	KEITH NASH	I gotta go.
M	PAUL	Catch you later, Keith Nash. GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box
M	CLIVE	Who was that?
M	PAUL	Keith Nash. How much was that?
M	CLIVE	$299.99. It's made of a low grade Turkish alloy.
M	PAUL	What did you get, speccy?
M	GRAHAM	X-Men action figure.
M	PAUL	Jesus Cheeeerist.
M	MRS. NASH	Don't lie, Keith.
M	KEITH NASH	I'm not lying.
M	MRS. NASH	Oh, come on now, Keith. If you carry on like this, you'll have to come with me to Dress Barn.
M	KEITH NASH	Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and his name was Paul!
M	MRS. NASH	Whoever hard of an alien called Paul? HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY
M	HAGGARD	What did you say, kid?
M	MRS. NASH	Excuse me. Who are you?
M	HAGGARD	Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret Service.
M	MRS. NASH	Secret Service?!
M	HAGGARD	Kid?
M	KEITH NASH	He was in the shop.
M	HAGGARD	Is he still in there? KEITH shakes his head.
M	O'REILLY	Did he say where he was going? KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the
M	HAGGARD	South. Toward New Mexico, huh? KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
M	O'REILLY	We've got him man! We're going to get a fucking promotion.
M	HAGGARD	You did good kid. Want a candy?
M	KEITH NASH	No thanks.
M	HAGGARD	Let's go. The two agents rush off.
M	O'REILLY	What about Zoil?
M	HAGGARD	Screw Zoil!
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	Where the hell do you think you're going? HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.
M	HAGGARD	We picked up a lead, sir. Little kid in the town said he saw an alien. Said he was heading toward New Mexico.
M	ZOIL	And you were just gonna take off?
M	HAGGARD	Thought it best to take the initiative, sir. We were going to radio you.
M	ZOIL	Well now, that's mighty civil of you. We have a chain of command. I expect you to abide by it. Where d'you say he was headed?
M	HAGGARD	New Mexico sir.
M	ZOIL	Well, then let's move it. They scramble.
M	ZOIL	Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting ideas about your station again. ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Zoil, what the hell's going on?
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	They've double back sir. They're heading toward New Mexico.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You better be right about this, Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of this shit. I want that little fucker's brain in a jar by sundown. MOSES smiles darkly.
M	MOSES BEHE	Looks like you're going the wrong way, Agent Zoil. That's what happens when you don't got the Lord on your side.
M	PAUL	He likes you, y'know?
F	RUTH	Graham? D'you think?
M	PAUL	What are you, blind? Beat.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Sorry. Beat.
M	PAUL	What you got there, a stigmatism? RUTH nods.
M	PAUL	You know you can get on operation for that, right?
F	RUTH	Papa said the Lord would fix it. Guess that's not gonna happen, seeing as we're living in a gigantic godless universe, with no hope of salvation.
M	PAUL	Hey, I don't know categorically that it's godless. I just said "probably'.
F	RUTH	Oh, that's a relief.
M	PAUL	Look, the way you're feeling now, that's why religion appeared in the first place. It's like existential Prozac. Imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for. That's how it is for much of humanity. Faith is a night- light. It illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend. Thing is, it's okay not to know everything. I mean, who knows what's really out there? Did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter?
F	RUTH	Yes.
M	PAUL	Oh. Well, then you get it, right? If they have the theory, who's to say at some point in the future they won't put it into practice and who's to say someone else didn't do that 13.5 Billion years ago and that's how the universe came to be? Course, then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but that's a whole other car park. I think Shakespeare said it best. "There's more in Heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy Horatio".
F	RUTH	What did you call me?
M	PAUL	Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You know, the Prince of Denmark?
F	RUTH	Denmark has a municipal population of 508,691. PAUL blinks.
M	PAUL	Anyway, if there is a God, didn't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't have to go round fixing people's lazy eyeballs?
F	RUTH	I suppose so.
M	PAUL	The eye is a delicate and complex thing, Ruth. You should get it taken care of. RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,
F	RUTH	They're back. PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the
M	PAUL	Perfect.
M	CLIVE	What are you going to do with this?
M	PAUL	Phone home. ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.
M	ZOIL	Yes, sir?
M	VOICE	Satellite's come up with a data analysis on all the traffic coming out of Prospect in the last 5 hours. There was only one RV, and guess what, nimrod?
M	ZOIL	It wasn't going to New Mexico?
M	VOICE	That's a three pointer Agent Zoil. You better spin your ass around. You got some serious catching up to do. Don't make me come out there.
M	ZOIL	No, sir. Where are they headed? If we gun it, maybe we can get the drop on their destination.
M	VOICE	They're on the 50, heading towards Gillette.
M	ZOIL	What else is around there?
M	VOICE	Not much. Thunder Basis, Bethlehem Creek.
M	ZOIL	Bethlehem Creek?
M	VOICE	Holy shit!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You don't think she's sill there, do you? MOSES smiles.
M	GRAHAM	You don't think she's still there do you?
M	PAUL	That's what you're going to find out for me.
M	CLIVE	Us?
M	PAUL	I can't just knock can I? What if she's moved on and someone else answers? I'm sick of people fainting on me. I'll hang back with my buddy Ruth, you two make first contact. Just enjoy it.
M	CLIVE	What shall we say if it's her? We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago?
M	PAUL	Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes.
F	RUTH	How do you know?
M	PAUL	It's my job to know.
M	GRAHAM	Hello?
M	CLIVE	Knock again. Who's there?
M	CLIVE	Tara Walton?
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Leave me alone!
M	GRAHAM	Okay. GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.
M	CLIVE	Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague, Graham Willy. We're from England and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago. Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to
F	TARA	What is this, some kind of joke?
M	CLIVE	It's no joke. PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.
M	PAUL	Hello Tara. TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.
M	PAUL	Aw nuts.
F	RUTH	Maybe I should make some tea.
F	TARA	Where are my manners? I never really have guests. Nobody comes up here. I go whole weeks without seeing a soul. TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are
M	PAUL	Can I do anything to help? TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
F	TARA	I've only just stopped believing in you, y'know? Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night. My parents, my friends. Everyone thought I was mad. They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real. I pulled you from that spaceship myself. Sat with you till the men came and took you away. If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too. They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different. Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "delayed this' and "post- traumatic that'. He just used to smile and say "there, there Tara'. He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later. I inherited this place. Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends. Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. I just kinda retreated into myself. I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. I always believed that one day you"d come back and here you are. The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.
F	TARA	Listen to me gabbing. Milk and sugar?
M	PAUL	I'm so sorry.
F	TARA	What for?
M	PAUL	For killing your dog and ruining your life.
F	TARA	That doesn't matter. Don't you see? You're real. I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy? Well, they can all go fuck themselves.
M	PAUL	It's good to see you, Tara. The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas
F	TARA	Now, where do you suppose that came from?
M	PAUL	Fuck a duck! Get out!
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	Shit!
M	PAUL	Tara, where's the back door?
F	TARA	In back. The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door
M	ZOIL	Paul, wait- A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent
M	PAUL	Clive?
M	CLIVE	Yes?
M	PAUL	A little help? CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.
M	HAGGARD	Freeze, space monkey!
M	GRAHAM	We're cut off.
F	TARA	Storm cellar! TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs,
M	ZOIL	Godammit Haggard!
M	PAUL	Not a fucking cent.
M	ZOIL	Oh great!
M	PAUL	Come on!
M	GRAHAM	Ow, my shins!
M	ZOIL	Help me up!
F	RUTH	Papa? PAUL grabs RUTH's hand.
M	PAUL	Come on.
M	MOSES BEHE	Take your hands off her, devil!
M	O'REILLY	Ready or not. He fires.
M	KA-BOOM!!!	O'REILLY is vaporized in a ball of orange fire.
M	CLIVE	I'll drive!
M	GRAHAM	Punch it! The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE
F	TARA	My weed!
M	ZOIL	Damnit Haggard, wait! HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great
M	GRAHAM	Your dad's persistent, isn't he?
F	RUTH	You have no idea. CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror.
M	CLIVE	I think we have a problem.
M	GRAHAM	What do we do?
M	PAUL	Go left.
M	CLIVE	What? CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and What the hell is he doing?!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Zoil. Progress report!
M	ZOIL	Sir, I-
M	HAGGARD	In pursuit, sir.
M	VOICE	Who the hell is this?
M	HAGGARD	Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been compromised. I'm assuming command.
M	ZOIL (O.S.)	Now wait a goddamn minute!
M	VOICE	I don't give a shit who's in command. Where' my fucking mooncoon?!
M	HAGGARD	Just ahead of me sir. We're heading East across scrubland just North of Mitchell Creek.
M	VOICE	I don't wanna hear from either of you jokers until that little mother fucker is under glass.
M	HAGGARD	Yes sir! HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed.
M	CLIVE	They're trying to overtake.
M	PAUL	Don't let him get past.
M	CLIVE	Shall I ram him? CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left.
M	CLIVE	What are we doing exactly? Immense pressure and temperature drop. High winds, circulating in the troposphere, two opposed fronts clashing. Oh, this is going to be a good one. RUTH stares out of the window.
F	RUTH	Oh my God.
M	ZOIL	-Shit!
M	CLIVE	Are you sure you know what you're doing?!
M	PAUL	Twenty seconds.
F	TARA	Paul, we'll get sucked right up.
M	PAUL	Stay on target. A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.
M	CLIVE	Paul!
M	PAUL	Stay on target.
M	ZOIL	He's insane! HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.
M	ZOIL	Haggard, stand down. Stand down! He's mine. I can do this!
M	ZOIL	Haggard, it's suicide. The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path
M	GRAHAM	It's gone!
M	CLIVE	Where did it go?
M	ZOIL	Son of a bitch! ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops.
M	ZOIL	Haggard. Wait a minute! An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off
M	MR. BEHE!	Damnit, hang back, hang back! You're not running this show any more Zoil. You had your chance.
M	ZOIL	Haggard, he knows what he's doing.
M	HAGGARD (O.S.)	So do I.
M	ZOIL	It's a trap!
M	CLIVE	They're still coming!
M	PAUL	Ruth, why don't you count back from
F	RUTH	Okay. 10...9...
M	PAUL	Back where I'm from, tornadoes are part of our daily life. We've learnt how to live with them, how to understand them.
M	CLIVE	They're gaining!
M	PAUL	We've learnt to anticipate their behavior, know their personalities, know when they're playing games.
M	GRAHAM	What games?
M	PAUL	Hide and seek? CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes
M	CLIVE	Great Caesar's ghost!
F	RUTH	How did you do that? How did you know?
M	PAUL	Evolution baby.
M	MOSES BEHE (O.S.)	Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV.
M	CLIVE	We've lost them. TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and
M	GRAHAM	Sorry.
F	RUTH	Wait, what about Papa?
M	CLIVE	I only saw one car following us.
M	PAUL	Where's Tara? TARA comes out of the toilet.
F	TARA	The bulb's gone in there.
M	GRAHAM	That was just awesome. Amazing driving Clive. It was like G.T.A. but potentially fatal. Wasn't it, Clive? Clive? A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.
M	CLIVE	Oh no.
M	GRAHAM	There goes the deposit.
M	CLIVE	Fare thee well friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed.
F	TARA	She rode that storm with a bullet in her heart and didn't stop until we we're safe.
F	RUTH	If there is a benevolent creator watching over everything then may he, she or it bless the 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.
M	GRAHAM	Paul?
M	PAUL (O.S.)	We're here. PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill. DEVIL's TOWER
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	Of course!
M	VOICE	Zoil! What the hell is going on?
M	ZOIL	We got hit by a twister, sir. Haggard's dead.
M	VOICE	What about the other one?
M	ZOIL	I lost him when the ranch exploded.
M	VOICE	Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been one fuck up after another. I should have handled it myself. I want that little bastard dead by midnight tonight or you'll be working security in a convention centre. Now where's that RV? ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.
M	VOICE	Zoil? ZOIL? ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.
F	RUTH	What you may not know is on the outside of the tower they bolted a series of ladders, all the way to the top, put there by William Rogers in 1893. He was the first man to climb the tower.
F	TARA	I climbed up there in 1976. Thought it would make a good site for some UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't the only one.
M	PAUL	We call them IFOs.
F	TARA	Cute.
M	PAUL	I-thank-you.
M	PAUL	This is it. PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his
M	PAUL	I'll miss these. PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the
F	TARA	Pretty.
M	GRAHAM	What now?
M	PAUL	We wait. A light appears in the sky some way off. That was quick.
M	PAUL	Wait a minute... A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Oh shit. Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.
M	VOICE	Well, whaddya know? Small world. VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed
M	PAUL	Lorenzo?! PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
M	VOICE	It was you! You told him. I should've known.
M	VOICE (CONT'D)	You've never made a mistake in your life. That's why I put you in charge of this fucking mission.
M	ZOIL	He's my friend! I've known him for twenty years. He introduced me to my wife damnit!
M	VOICE	You stupid son of a bitch. In five years, you could have been where I am.
M	ZOIL	I don't want to be where you are.
M	VOICE	Too bad, seeing as I'm the one hold'ng all the cards and when I say "cards", I of course mean big fucking gun. VOICE points his gun at PAUL.
M	PAUL	How'd you find me?
M	VOICE	It was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard to figure out where you were headed. You always did have a flare for the dramatic. PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.
M	VOICE	Let's go. TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
M	CLIVE	He's not going anywhere.
M	VOICE	Be honest with yourself, two scoops. What is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game? CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
M	CLIVE	Blind fury. The blade falls off.
M	CLIVE	Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.
M	VOICE	Step aside, you fat nerd. Graham, his this man. CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
F	RUTH	Leave him alone! VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.
M	GRAHAM	Leave her alone! VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.
F	TARA	Leave them alone. WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.
F	TARA	You're not taking him away again. He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.
M	PAUL	Thank you, Tara.
F	TARA	Don't mention it. PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.
M	ZOIL	The things I do for you, huh?
M	PAUL	You know I appreciate it.
M	ZOIL	Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys? Let me take a look at that. Ruth, shine the torch down here? RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL. BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
M	MOSES BEHE	Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.
M	GRAHAM	Noooooooooo! GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
M	MOSES BEHE	I...I never meant to shoot her. I was aiming for the goblin.
M	CLIVE	He's not a goblin he's from another planet.
M	MOSES BEHE	But he can't be. He... he...
M	GRAHAM	He's an alien you stupid man! Oh Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I should have never persuaded you to come with us. RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.
F	RUTH	What, and miss all this? Graham, I've lived more in the last 48 hours that I ever did in that trailer park. Isn't that what you said living was all about? Right now? This conversation? That tree? My next cheeseburger? I'm not afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold though. Hey, where is everybody?
M	MOSES BEHE	What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
M	PAUL	There is no way this thing isn't gonna end happy. PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
M	MOSES BEHE	Get away from her! Don't you touch my little girl. CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
M	GRAHAM	Ruth, are you okay?
F	RUTH	I think so. Is anyone hungry? I really feel like a cheese burger. Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
M	MOSES BEHE	Thank you. RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.
F	RUTH	You can kiss me now. They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
M	PAUL	Looks like the geek shall inherit the earth. The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.
M	VOICE	I wouldn't say- A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
M	PAUL	Happens to the best of us. One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
M	PAUL	I'm sorry I frightened you so much your hair turned white.
F	RUTH	You didn't frighten me. You freed me. You helped me see the light. Take care of her big man.
M	MOSES BEHE	I will sir. God be with you.
M	PAUL	Whatever dude. They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man. Say bye to Karen for me.
M	ZOIL	Safe trip Short Round. PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
M	CLIVE	You can keep it.
M	PAUL	Cool. Okay.
M	GRAHAM	What did you think?
M	PAUL	Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although you know what? Sometimes, less is more. The boys nod.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Thank you.
M	GRAHAM	No, thank you.
M	CLIVE	You are, and always will be, our friend.
M	PAUL	Come here you fucking geeks. They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	This is a self-sustaining light orb. Might come in handy, you know, if a bulb goes. TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	You coming?
F	TARA	What?
M	PAUL	I ruined your life Tara. Think I owe you a new one. TARA takes PAUL's hand.
F	TARA	I don't have my toothbrush.
M	PAUL	Baby, where we're going, you won't need teeth. TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
M	GRAHAM	That was good, wasn't it? A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own
M	PUBLICIST	Just one item per person please. He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is
F	RUTH	Hey.
M	GRAHAM	Hey babe. You okay?
F	RUTH	I'm just taking Tara over to the autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's here!
M	CLIVE	Oh, say hi from us, won't you? RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach.
M	MAJOR NERD 1	Uh... were you... did you?
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	There you go.
M	SECURITY MAN (O.S.)	Next in line please.
M	MAJOR NERD 2	Uh... were you... did you?
M	GRAHAM/CLIVE	There you go.
M	SECURITY MAN	Guys, if you've had your book signed please move on. Tilt up to reveal the security man. It is none other than
