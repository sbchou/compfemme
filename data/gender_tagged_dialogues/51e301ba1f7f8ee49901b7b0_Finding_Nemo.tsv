M		Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your deliver or did he deliver?
M		man delivered.
M		it wasn't so easy.
M		a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
M		better believe they did--every single one of them.
M		You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.
M		you do like it, don't you?
M		no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
M		honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
M		you're gonna wake the kids.
M		right. Right.
M		look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.
M		wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
M		like Nemo.
M		Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.
M		think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!
M		What if they don't like me?
M		
M		really.
M		over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.
M		
M		remember how we met?
M		I try not to.

M		
M		you woozy?
M		
M		many stripes do I have?
M		fine.
M		the stripe question!
M		
M		See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,

M		you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
M		on, dad. It's time for school.
M		Forgot to brush.
M		
M		you want this anemone to sting you?
M		
M		
M		I'm done.
M		missed a spot.
M		
M		Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!
M		right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get

M		
M		right. Come on, boy.
M		maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!
M		you ever met a shark?
M		and I don't plan to.
M		old are sea turtles?
M		turtles? I don't know.
M		Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
M		you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
M		you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
M		that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

M		
M		
M		Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.
M		yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.
M		actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
M		come on, clownie.

M		you can go now.
M	RAY	hello. Who is this?
M		Nemo.
M	RAY	Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
M		
M	RAY	live in what kind of home?
M		anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--
M	RAY	okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!
M		so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
M		it's time for you to go now.
M	RAY	worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
M		man!
M	RAY	
M		Nemo!
M		dad!
M		son! Be safe.

M		I wasn't.
M		does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out know you can't swim well.
M		can swim fine, dad, okay?
M		it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
M		dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

M		hate you.
M	RAY	to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a

M		it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.
M		memory loss..I don't believe this!
M		it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
M		wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]
M

M		ow! Oww!
M		doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?
M

M		careful I don't make you cry when I win!
M		I don't think so!
M		ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.
M		question is, Dory, are you hungry?
M		Hungry?

M		first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.
M		
M		drains lead to the ocean, kid.

M	FISH	ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!
M	FISH	that's amazing!
M	FISH	then dives thousands of..
M		straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
M		the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
M		these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
M	BIRD	means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..
M	BIRD 1	in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

M		We're gonna just swim straight.
M		Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.
M		
M		this is taking a while.

M		righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.
M		and small, and white stripes..
M		And the next one's just a guess: me.

M		I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
M		Hey!
M		gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
M		whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.
M		fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!
M		there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here.
M		Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. is it with men and asking for directions?
M		I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
M		wanna get outta here, don't you?
M		course, I do.

M		much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?
M		doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!
