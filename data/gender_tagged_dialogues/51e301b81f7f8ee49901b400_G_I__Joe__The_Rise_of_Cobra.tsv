M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MCCULLEN	Still using matchlocks, are ya? I can get you a pair of flintlocks, you let me sneak out of here. Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent. Good ones? The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the kill.
M	MCCULLEN	The best. From Spain. And perhaps a couple of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them. Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.
M	GUARD #2	On yer feet, you Scottish pig.
M	WARDEN	James McCullen, you have been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself.
M	MCCULLEN	Your King is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies. I should've charged him double.
M	WARDEN	You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies!
M	MCCULLEN	They offered me a Chancellorship, because unlike your simpleton King, they know that is the McCullen destiny, to run the wars, the true power, not simply to supply arms.
M	WARDEN	Do you have anything else to say before the sentence is carried out?
M	MCCULLEN	Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far bigger and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine. My sons will continue to rise along after I am gone. As will their sons. And, God willing, their sons. It shall not end with my death. The Warden smiles back sinisterly.
M	WARDEN	Oh, we're not going to kill you, McCullen. We're going to make an example of you. The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the
M	WARDEN (CONT'D)	So that no man, woman, nor child may ever see your treacherous face again, you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life. The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock.
M	MCCULLEN (V.0.)	War used to be the exception. Now it is the new state of play, a constant, unavoidable...
M	MCCULLEN	Tragic as they are to fight, wars must be won. But perhaps they don't have to be as destructive as they've been in the past. A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Nano-mites. Perfect little soldiers. Their size can be programmed as well as their intended task. Originally developed to isolate and destroy cancer cells, but at Mars Industries, and with the help of a little NATO funding... A few laughs around the room. McCullen soaks it up.
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	.we discovered how to program them to eliminate most anything. For instance... metal. ON SCREEN: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched missile at a
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Once the target has been destroyed, the launcher triggers a kill switch unique to each warhead that short- circuits the nano-mites, preventing any unwanted destruction. ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Each warhead contains seven million nano-mites and has the ability to eat anything from a single tank to an entire city. But without innocent casualties. Which is why this has been such a priority for me and my company. The room breaks into APPLAUSE. FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a
M	HAWK	Guess you'll be the first arms dealer up for the Nobel Peace Prize. Laughter in the room. McCullen smiles, being a good sport.
M	MCCULLEN	I prefer the term "armament solutions engineer" Gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce that tomorrow morning your first order of nanotech warheads will ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan. The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke. There
M	DUKE	The hell's wrong with you, Stalworth, you didn't eat that Chicken A La King at chow did ya?
M	STALWORTH	The mission, sir...
M	DUKE	What about it? Another day, another run.
M	STALWORTH	Never had anything to worry about before. Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to
M	STALWORTH (CONT'D)	Three weeks old. Be seeing him for the first time next leave. Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth. His eyes go
M	DUKE	You're off the mission.
M	STALWORTH	Sir?
M	DUKE	That's what you want, right? Stalworth doesn't argue. Duke hands him back the photo.
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	If your head's with them, you're no good to me. Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	One thing, though: you step off this one, you're out of Special Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk and chair back at the base. You're be run of the mill. Regular.
M	STALWORTH	I... I guess I can live with that.
M	DUKE	Then you should. Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves. Duke's hard eyes
M	HAWK	Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy, British Army.
M	MCCULLEN	I know who you are General hawk. As sharp in a briefing room as your reputation is on the battlefield.
M	HAWK	Not hardly ...You gave me a broad target, I couldn't resist.
M	MCCULLEN	It's an honor to meet a man of your many accomplishments. McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him.
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	What's on your mind, General?
M	HAWK	Your warheads. Securing them in transit. Forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where.
M	MCCULLEN	Those "ears" all have top security clearance.
M	HAWK	We both know what that's worth.
M	MCCULLEN	Look, General, delivery is my responsibility and it's not one I take lightly. I had NATO assign an elite American Special Forces unit, a fully armored convoy with air support. I assure you, my warheads will be quite safe.
M	HAWK	I've made a career of showing up where I'm needed, whether ordered to or not. And if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are.. Then my unit is needed.
M	MCCULLEN	This is no time to play catch up. The NATO team's been drilling for weeks. They're lit up and ready to roll.
M	HAWK	My unit doesn't need mission specific training. They're chosen because of their ability to handle any situation.
M	MCCULLEN	Maybe next time, General... What did you say your unit was called?
M	HAWK	I didn't. I just said they were always ready. McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a
M	DUKE	All right, listen up, the Cougars will be front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package. Minimum distance at all times. Choppers will cover us overhead. The Lab Workers step up.
M	LAB WORKER #1	Captain Hauser. Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE
F	RIPCORD	Not gonna explode, is it?
M	LAB WORKER	They're not weaponized yet. And the kill switches are attached to the launchers. All the same, I'd avoid potholes if I were you. Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another
F	RIPCORD	Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out? If you want, I could--
M	DUKE	--We have our orders. Okay, people! We're on the clock, let's move. Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws him a cheesy grin.
M	DUKE	Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.
F	RIPCORD	You know, I hate all the Mother Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's Bill, see ya in a few."
M	DUKE	Not me, I joined up for the jargon.
M	VOICE ON RADIO	Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose out.
F	RIPCORD	Just saying, you know, if I ran things...
M	DUKE	Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay up all night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other "Bro".
F	RIPCORD	But we'd be badasses, right Bro?
M	DUKE	Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the road, Rip.
F	RIPCORD	Hey Duke, ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs?
M	DUKE	Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.
F	RIPCORD	And you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty?
M	DUKE	Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty of thoughts up there. Keep rear security tight, boys.
F	RIPCORD	Well, the second I try and make myself not have thoughts, I always have 'em. Like now, know what I'm thinking about?
M	DUKE	Please don't say the Air Forces.
F	RIPCORD	The Air Forces.
M	DUKE	I thought we were done with that discussion.
F	RIPCORD	You were done with it, not me. Look, I loev flying... Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	I've been flying since I was thirteen years old. Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.
M	DUKE	I don't think your daddy's crop duster counts as hours logged.
F	RIPCORD	Jets, man, jets. You know I always qualify when I'm on leave.
M	DUKE	Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get up in the air, we'll get you a trampoline back at the base.
F	RIPCORD	We've done ten years in the Army, I just think we should see if the grass really is greener.
M	DUKE	idea you've ever come up with, nd that's saying something.
F	RIPCORD	Funny. Real funny.
M	DUKE	I don't wanna transfer to the Air Force, okay?
F	RIPCORD	It's always about you, isn't it? Give me one good reason?
M	DUKE	I want to be in the fight, not flying over it.
F	RIPCORD	Won't be saying that when you call in an air strike and I come screaming in to save your--
M	DUKE	--Eyes on the road, Rip.
F	RIPCORD	Hey, on the training run weren't there herders around here? This puts Duke instantly on the alert.
F	RIPCORD	Jesus Christ! Bird Down!
M	DUKE	Back up! Back up! Back up! Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We are under attack. Repeat --we are under attack!
M	DUKE	Out! Everyone get out of the vehicles! Now!
M	DUKE	You okay? Yeah, except for all the blood. Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head. Then they hear a
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Who the hell is that? Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out. Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows
M	CASE.	Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell.
F	RIPCORD	Duke?
M	DUKE	Shut up.
F	RIPCORD	If I die...
M	DUKE	You're not gonna die.
F	RIPCORD	I just want you to know... you never could run worth a damn.
M	DUKE	Jesus, Rip.
F	RIPCORD	I'm just saying, it's be nice if you could move a little faster. And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.
M	DUKE	Stay here.
F	RIPCORD	Sure.
M	DUKE	I'm gettin' that package. Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	What the hell...? Her face softens hesitantly.
M	ANA	Hello, Duke... Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face,
M	ANA (CONT'D)	You have to admit you had that coming. Ana struggles with something going on inside her head. Then
M	ANA (CONT'D)	Good-bye, Duke. Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES
M	DUKE	Air Force.. .right. A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips
M	HEAVY DUTY	Time to lay down some bass! He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You
M	DUKE	Ana! She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest
F	SCARLETT	The warheads! Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky SILENCE... Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach
M	DUKE	Stand down! Stand the hell down!
M	HEAVY DUTY	Lower your weapon, Sir. We're not the enemy.
M	DUKE	Pointing weapons at me doesn't make you my friend. ABEL "BREAKER" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
M	BREAKER	Please hand over the case, sir.
M	DUKE	I don't know who you are, and I sure as hell don't know who they are, and until I find out, I'm not lowering anything or handling anything over. CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle.
F	RIPCORD	What's your unit?
F	SCARLETT	That's classified. Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his
M	BREAKER	Someone would like a word with you. Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke,
M	HAWK	State you name and rank.
M	DUKE	.you first.
M	HAWK	My team just saved your life. now's the part where you say "thank you".
M	DUKE	Those aren't the words that come to mind just now. We weren't told about any support for this mission, so you better tell your team to stand down. Ripcord eyes his sight.
F	RIPCORD	Happy to turn this into a turkey shoot. Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.
M	HAWK	You must be... Ripcord, expert marksman, weapons specialist, jet
F	RIPCORD	Told ya.
M	HAWK	I'm General Clayton Abernathy. You may have heard of me, .Duke. A glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods.
M	DUKE	General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO Forward Command... Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and
M	HAWK	That was my last job. I'm in a whole new outfit now. Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head. Breaker flinches.
M	BREAKER	tracking beacon, for security.
M	HAWK	Hand over the weapons case son, and let us deliver the warheads.
M	DUKE	No way. I signed for 'em. My mission, my package. I carry them, I deliver them. Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING
M	BREAKER	Wasn't hard, was it?
M	DUKE	Fine. But you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment. Team Alpha will deliver you to me.
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	And where exactly are you, General?
M	HAWK	Come see for yourself.
F	RIPCORD	Hey, you're cute.
F	SCARLETT	He's going into shock.
F	RIPCORD	What's your name, darlin'? Snake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle,
F	SCARLETT	I thought all the Special Ops guys were tough.
F	RIPCORD	We are tough ... . but also sensitive. Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff you gave me. Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	.and a kung-fu grip.
M	HEAVY DUTY	The name's Heavy Duty. Duke has the weapons case on his lap.
M	DUKE	What kind of outfit is this? Not regular Army based on the accents. I have you as an Aussie... And you're a Johannesburger... And you: French North Africa. Algiers?
M	BREAKER	Tunisia. Where were you born?
F	RIPCORD	Are you kidding me? Duke wasn't born, he was Government-Issued!
M	DUKE	But somehow you're all in the same unit. One you can't tell me the name of right?
F	SCARLETT	We'd get tossed for telling.
F	RIPCORD	Duke, Duke, don't you get it: they're super secret, they're Mission Impossible. This tape's gonna self-destruct in five--
M	DUKE	--You're gonna go after them aren't you? The ones that hit my convoy. Then whoever you are, whatever this unit is, I want in.
M	BREAKER	Not our call. Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett.
F	RIPCORD	I want in too. That way we can spend some bunker time together. A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away. It's
F	SCARLETT	You two a team or something?
F	RIPCORD	We've been together forever. But not like that. Hi, I'm Ripcord.
F	SCARLETT	Why do they call you that? Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file:
M	BREAKER	Because his name is Wallace Weems!
M	SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1	Alpha-One, this is Base. You are cleared or entry.
M	HAWK (O.S.)	Welcome to the new Pit! Duke and Ripcord turn to see hawk and Cover girl walking out
M	HAWK (CONT'D)	Duke.
M	DUKE	General.
M	HAWK	I've read a lot about you two.
F	RIPCORD	Okay, look, I didn't "steal" that Blackhawk, I was borrowing it... Duke shoots him a look. Hawk steps right up to Duke.
M	HAWK	Matter of fact, I saw that one of my subordinates tried to recruit you to our little operation a while back.
M	DUKE	I was never asked to join any Op group.
M	HAWK	Remember a tall gentleman approaching you in Thailand when you were on leave, four years ago?
M	DUKE	Vaguely.
M	HAWK	Right before you tore up the bar?
F	RIPCORD	Four years? My man had some issues. Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.
M	DUKE	This doesn't look like any Tac Op I've ever seen. Where are we?
M	HAWK	Okay, you trusted me by going with my team, so I'll trust you. There's a loud METALLIC CLANG and part of the PLATFORM begins
M	HAWK (CONT'D)	Technically, GI JOE doesn't exist. But if it did, it'd be comprised of the top men and women from the best military units all over the world. The alpha dogs... They see a pretty woman sip into a next-gen CAMO-SUIT, which
F	RIPCORD	Oh man, I want one of those.
M	BREAKER	The suit or the girl?
F	RIPCORD	Both. Scarlett's eyes roll. They descend into the DESERT COMBAT
M	HAWK	Ten nations signed on in their first year. Working together, sharing intel. Now we have twenty- three.
M	DUKE	I've never seen combat gear this sleek, what's the trick?
F	SCARLETT	Liquid armor. They reach the DEEP SEA COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and
M	HAWK (O.S.)	Good news is we've been pretty successful so far. The bad news is whenever we manage to shut down one organization, another springs up in its place.
F	RIPCORD	Who could possibly fund all this?
M	HEAVY DUTY	Oprah.
M	CONTROL ROOM TECHNICIAN #1	Mr. McCullen's standing by, Sir.
M	HAWK	Patch him through, please.
M	DUKE	So who hit us out there?
M	COVER GIRL	Currently unidentified.
M	HEAVY DUTY	And how'd that bitch in leather get a jump jet like ours?
F	SCARLETT	Whoever she is, she's clearly well- financed, with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry. Their capabilities are beyond anything we've ever encountered.
F	RIPCORD	That's the reason we got our asses kicked. Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him.
M	HAWK	We're going to need to find out everything we can about her. Knowing is half the battle.
F	RIPCORD	What's the other half? McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Jesus! And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR.
M	HAWK	Gentlemen, this is James McCullen, CEO of MARS Industries, the man who built these warheads. WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH McCullen standing in front of a
M	MCCULLEN	General, most men I've encountered in this business over-promise and under-deliver. You're the opposite. Clearly, you were the security option I should have chosen. ON DUKE: Steaming behind his military demeanor.
M	DUKE	My team did everything we could out there. A lot of good men went down--
M	MCCULLEN	--But not you.
M	DUKE	That mission was classified, sir. Clearly, somebody sold us out.
M	MCCULLEN	I've spent ten years and thirteen billion Euros creating these four warheads. Your job, Captain, was to protect them, and if it wasn't for General Hawk, you would've failed.
M	HAWK	That's not a fair assessment. He followed his orders to the letter.
M	MCCULLEN	Well that wasn't enough. Duke bristles. McCullen turns to Hawk.
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	What are your coordinates? I'll have NATO send another special ops team to retrieve the warheads, company strength this time.
M	HAWK	Apologizes, Mr McCullen. It's not that I don't trust you...I don't trust anybody. Are you sure you're not a McCullen?
M	HAWK	I don't talk smooth enough to be a McCullen.
M	MCCULLEN	You do just fine, General. Now, so the bastards who attacked you can't find you, you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case.
M	BREAKER	We already have.
M	MCCULLEN	Good man. So, can I count on you to deliver the warheads to NATO now?
M	HAWK	I think it unwise to expose them at the moment. This group might make another attempt. We need to find and neutralize them before we can consider moving your weapons.
M	MCCULLEN	Alright. But allow me to check the warheads to see if any have been damaged. Duke begrudgingly sets the case down. Breaker turns on his
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Open it, please.
M	BREAKER	My scan says they're intact...
M	MCCULLEN	General?
M	HAWK	What's the code? ON DUKE, listening carefully.
M	MCCULLEN	Five-two-nine-four-four-oh. Breaker enters the code. As the case opens, Breaker
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Please keep me informed of your progress, General. Duke and McCullen share a quick glare. And then McCullen cuts
F	SCARLETT	Breaker?
M	BREAKER	That bloke's Beta waves were going up, down, and sideways... I think he's hiding something.
M	MCCULLEN	I spend five years setting this up. Wringing money out of NATO. This was supposed to be the easy part.
M	ANA	If you'd let me stage the assault at your precious factory, we could have contained the situation.
M	MCCULLEN	And lost the trust of our clients in the process? It had to be NATO's fault. What happened? Did you hesitate?
M	ANA	You're implying this was about some ancient history? That's as laughable as your Intel. What went wrong was the Joes appearing out of nowhere. He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.
M	MCCULLEN	Forgive me, jealousy isn't my strong suit.
M	ANA	Forget that, where are we now? Have you tracked the case?
M	MCCULLEN	They deactivated the beacon. I gave them a code to quietly re-arm it. McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	There it is. The infamous Pit.
M	ANA	I will get those warheads back. McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his
M	MCCULLEN	I hope so.
M	ANA	If I were really there, I might actually let you touch me.
M	MCCULLEN	I'll send a jet.
M	ANA	Business first. Besides, I'm married, remember? Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.
M	MCCULLEN	Sometimes I really hate technology. He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:
M	STORM SHADOW (O.S.)	It is most often used by those without honor. McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean
M	MCCULLEN	There can't be any more mistakes. The schedule can't be compromised any further.
M	STORM SHADOW	If you had sent me, it would be done.
M	MCCULLEN	I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow. To the Baroness's villa. .Make sure her commitment doesn't waiver. Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window. WE PULL
M	THE DOCTOR	Welcome back.
M	MCCULLEN	Good to be back.
M	THE DOCTOR	we've been very busy. He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all
M	MCCULLEN	Is it working?
M	THE DOCTOR	You tell me. The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	The King Cobra is a magnificent creature. Its venom can kill a full grown elephant with a single bite. He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	We introduced into each subject one thousand cc's of the nano-mite solution. As expected, subjects became extremely ill and fell into a coma-like state for approximately forty hours. The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket,
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	When they returned to sentience, brain scans showed complete inactivity in the self-preservation region of the cortex.
M	MCCULLEN	English, Doctor. The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps
M	THE DOCTOR	They feel no fear. The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	Cortical nerve clusters revealed complete inactivity--
M	MCCULLEN	--Doctor.
M	THE DOCTOR	They feel no pain. The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently Frontal lobe concepts of morality are disengaged... No remorse...
M	MCCULLEN	And they are completely obedient?
M	THE DOCTOR	Of course. .The real world applications are endless. The Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously.
M	THE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)	The nano-mites will target the venom. STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	So you tell me: is it working?
M	THE DOCTOR	The science is staggering isn't it?
M	MCCULLEN	You've done well. You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard.
M	THE DOCTOR	But research and science are expensive propositions. If I can make a suggestion..? McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	Selling one batch of warheads on the black market could fund--
M	MCCULLEN	--I appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor. But this world is messy enough. Factions fighting and scrabbling for control, for resources, and it's only going to get worse as the century progresses. No. What the world needs is unification. Leadership. It needs to be taken out of chaos by someone with complete control. He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER,
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	My family was once this close to that kind of power... The French... Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Once I get my hands on the reins, the money will take care of itself. You'll be able to do all the research you want. McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him.
M	BREAKER	We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty's helmet cam. Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:
F	RIPCORD	Hey, that's-- Duke cuts him off with a look. Breaker extracts a full 3D
M	BREAKER	Now we can run the face through an infinity scan.
M	HAWK	We have access to any photograph on any server anywhere in the world.
M	BREAKER	Everyone gets photographed in some way at some time. ATM machines, airports, crowd shots at a football game. We'll find her. Duke just stares at Ana's photo. Ripcord whispers quietly:
F	RIPCORD	You okay?
M	DUKE	.what happened to her? For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say. Cover Girl walks
M	HAWK	From NATO. I am now the official custodian of the warheads. Your mission is complete. Once you hand it over, that is. Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat.
M	DUKE	When you move it, she's gonna come after you, you know that, right? And with her Intel, and her toys... she'll find you.
M	HAWK	And your point is...?
M	DUKE	You're going to go after her first. And I want to help.
F	RIPCORD	Let us in on this, General. Our team just got wasted. I think a little payback is in order.
M	HAWK	You don't ask to be a part of GI JOE. You get asked.
M	DUKE	You scouted me four years ago, now I'm ready. Let's have at it.
M	HAWK	I've lost men too, Captain. Good men. But attempting to--
M	DUKE	I know her.
M	HAWK	Excuse me?
M	DUKE	You said knowing is half the battle. Well, I know who she is. Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can tell you everything you need to know about her until... four years ago. After that, well, obviously sa lot's changed. Hawk just stares in disbelief.
M	HAWK	Before this goes any further, I need to know what I'm dealing with, a man looking to settle a score, or a man who can put the mission first. Because the battlefield is the wrong place for emotion. Could you kill her?
M	DUKE	If I had to.
M	HAWK	Chances are you will. But if you flinch, hesitate even an instant... what I'm trying to say is, unless you can kill her graveyard dead I don't want you.
M	DUKE	I can. I signed on to deliver those warheads, General, and despite your present authority, I want to finish the job. Hawk regards him for a moment.
M	HAWK	So tell me about her.
M	DUKE	Okay, I'll start right here: I hope that vault is tight, because she always gets what she wants...
M	DECOBRAY	Hello, darling.
M	ANA	How is work at the lab?
M	DECOBRAY	Steady progress.
M	ANA	So the Minister of Defense was pleased?
M	DECOBRAY	He was. You know I wish I could tell you more...
M	ANA	Of course.
M	DECOBRAY	You were gone a long time. How were the shops in Monte Carlo?
M	ANA	I didn't get what I was after. They head up the stairs.
M	DECOBRAY	I suppose I should be grateful.
M	ANA	Most husbands would be.
M	DECOBRAY	Most husbands don't have such mysterious wives, they know exactly where they are and what they do. They think they know.
M	ANA	I never get over how beautiful...
M	DECOBRAY	Neither do I. She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly
M	ANA	Let me change and freshen up and I'll meet you for dinner.
M	DECOBRAY	Of course. Decobray smiles at her and leaves. The smile falls from
M	STORM SHADOW	Mr. McCullen gave me explicit orders to sever the Baron's spine if he so much as touched you.
M	ANA	He's my husband, of course he touches me. Tell McCullen to grow up. Besides, the Baron says his work in the lab goes much better after we've... touched. And that's the important thing.
M	STORM SHADOW	I'll be accompanying you to retrieve the warheads this time. Along with some of the men the Doctor's been working on.
M	ANA	The Doctor.
M	STORM SHADOW	We go at dawn. Storm Shadow turns and heads out through the doors. Ana
F	RIPCORD	My hot tub only holds four. No, five.
M	DUKE	I've been wanting to do this before we deploy.
M	ANA	Duke...it's beautiful. It's too nice you lunatic.
M	DUKE	Only time I'm buying one of these, so why not? They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws Well, what do you say? She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear: Say yes, you idiot...! Lieutenant REX LEWIS saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his
M	REX (CONT'D)	.Before I tell my new brother-in- law what it's like to share a bathroom with you.
M	DUKE	Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.
M	REX	I was coming to offer you a ride back to post.
M	ANA	Time already?
M	DUKE	We go at oh-five hundred.
M	ANA	Is it WMDs? It is, right? That's why you're pulling Rex out of the
M	DUKE	Ana, we can't--
M	ANA	Yeah, yeah. Classified. Top Secret. Have to kill me if you told me, blah, blah, blah.
M	DUKE	Speaking of classified information, you still haven't answered.
M	ANA	Yes. Of course it's yes. On one She grabs REX and pulls him down on his knees next to Duke.
M	ANA (CONT'D)	Promise me that you won't let my genius egghead brother get hurt. He's the only family I've got left. Promise me.
M	DUKE	I promise. She smiles and holds out her hand. He threads the ring onto
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	Jesus, Rip. Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:
F	RIPCORD	How was I supposed know she was married!? Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?
M	DUKE	I'm done proposing.
M	ANA	I already said yes.
F	RIPCORD	Not official until you answer my question. Do you love my boy?
M	ANA	Always and forever. Ripcord flips open his CELL PHONE and takes the photo of Ana
F	RIPCORD	Now I've gotta find someone to love me, as many times as possible for the next three hours. If you want to join us, you'll need to be mission ready, Joe style. This is the Mark One Accelerator Suit.
F	RIPCORD	What's it accelerate?
M	HEAVY DUTY	You. It'll make you run faster, jump higher, and hit harder than any of your enemies. A TITANIUM BOOT slides over a shoe. COBALT MACHINE PARTS
M	HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)	Head-to-toe turbo-hydraulics and highly-pressurized pneumatics. They both slap on aerodynamic, flying-wing HELMETS. Inside,
M	HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)	An advanced cybernetics heads-up display, feeding into your helmet.
M	HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)	Two gas propelled grappling spears and six ten millimeter, hi- explosive, heat seeking, fire-and- forget rockers. Rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless SUBMACHINE GUN on
M	HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)	And a nine millimeter, caseless submachine gun with six hundred rounds capable of firing all of them in thirty seconds. Duke and Ripcord are now buckled in, getting a feel for the
F	RIPCORD	I just missed everything you said. How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?
F	SCARLETT	Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But not good enough. Gotta get under a minute to qualify.
M	DUKE	What's the record?
F	SCARLETT	Forty-five.
F	RIPCORD	Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes?
F	SCARLETT	No, me. Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL.
F	RIPCORD	You can do this whole course with that thing in forty-five seconds?
F	SCARLETT	If you're going to shoot at something, kill it. Otherwise take up knitting.
F	RIPCORD	When I want something, I don't just shoot at it... When I get a target in my sights, I take it down. His meaning is clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine
F	SCARLETT	Here. Go on. Try it.
F	RIPCORD	I wouldn't want to show you up.
F	SCARLETT	Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.
F	RIPCORD	What can I tell you? I guess I'm just a considerate, humble guy. You'll learn that about me.
F	SCARLETT	I'm the "target in your sights," right? You've got ten rounds to "take me down".
F	RIPCORD	I don't want to hurt you.
F	SCARLETT	They're training arrows. The most I'll feel is a little jolt. Scarlett walks back and faces him. He glances aside at Duke
M	DUKE	C'mon, Rip. Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett
F	SCARLETT	Guess you didn't really want me that bad, rip. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the
M	BREAKER	Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a beat. Isn't that sweet? Sensors detecting seismic activity to the southwest. Probably just a tremor, but have a team check it.
M	DUKE	Again. They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	Again. Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This
M	ANA	The foundation of this fence is a hundred feet deep. No going under. Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall. If we don't get him out he'll suffocate. Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?
M	ANA (CONT'D)	Just thought I'd mention it.
M	STORM SHADOW	All that matters is the mission. Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six
M	STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)	Acceptable collateral damage.
M	ANA	Is there any other? Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down
M	HEAVY DUTY	You can learn a whole hell of a lot about a girl by the way she dances. Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes. Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.
M	HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)	See? He agrees.
F	SCARLETT	No, he doesn't. Do you? This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.
M	SCARLETT (CONT'D)	See, he knows you have to listen to get to know someone. Right, Rip? Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.
F	RIPCORD	What? You say something? Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.
M	BREAKER	Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with Heavy D on this one.
M	BREAKER (CONT'D)	Like my man says, get a girl on the floor, you don't just see how she moves, you get the smell of her. What biologists tell us is that the decision is made by he nose long before the rest of the body gets involved. It's a question of pheromones.
F	SCARLETT	You're going to teach me science? I read all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex pheromones when I was twelve. I'm just saying, it's not very romantic. Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.
F	RIPCORD	Heavy told me she graduated college at twelve. No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	She's like a freaky genius. A deadly, freaky genius.
M	DUKE	You like her, I get it already.
M	BREAKER	You can't learn this stuff in a book, Scarlett. You have to at least kiss a guy, before you're an expert on romance. The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.
F	SCARLETT	Who am I shooting first? The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised.
F	RIPCORD	You haven't kissed anyone? Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he
M	DUKE	Really firing on all cylinders there, Rip.
M	HEAVY DUTY	All I know is, when the bass get's that booty shaking in the right way, I'm in the skin like a man named Flynn. Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show
F	RIPCORD	Hell with it. He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.
M	BREAKER	Into the Valley of Death rode the Heavy Duty looks at him, confused. Breaker nods to Ripcord,
F	RIPCORD	Beach reading, huh? She groans and lowers the book only slightly.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the wrong foot... Without changing expression she goes back to her book.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Okay look, I'm attracted to you. And you, you're attracted to me. And him-- The Zen Master, he creeps me out, but what I'm saying is--
F	SCARLETT	"We're attracted to one another."
F	RIPCORD	Thank you.
F	SCARLETT	That's what you're saying, not what I'm saying.
F	RIPCORD	Okay, what are you saying?
F	SCARLETT	Attraction is an emotion. Emotions are not based in science. And if you can't quantify or prove that something exists, well, in my mind... it doesn't.
F	RIPCORD	Okay, I'll get back to you on that. And he walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in.
M	HAWK	Duke, You scored in the top half- percent of all people we've ever tested. Rip, well, if we average your scores with Duke's, you pass too. Welcome aboard, provisionally. But we still need to see if you pass muster in the field. Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and rip nod back with pride.
M	HEAVY DUTY	YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz!
M	COVER GIRL	Sorry to disturb you, general.
M	HAWK	That's all right, Cover Girl. What am I signing now? Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her
M	DUKE	The warheads. They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a The weapons case sits on a table. She opens the case to
M	DUKE	They can't be far.
M	DUKE	Put the case down, Ana, Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.
F	RIPCORD	And you get out of that...thing. Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks
M	ANA	Fine. Done. Then she takes a step toward Duke.
M	DUKE	Stop, Ana. Stop right there. But she doesn't. She just keeps slowly moving toward him.
M	ANA	You can't shoot me, can you?
M	DUKE	I will if I have to.
M	ANA	Deep down, you're still the same man I fell in love with.
M	DUKE	Don't force this, Ana.
M	ANA	What could have been, right, Duke? You beside your best man. Me walking down the aisle.
F	RIPCORD	Don't listen to her, Duke. Was I really going to be your best man?
M	DUKE	Don't make me do this god-damnit!
M	ANA	"Don't make me do this?" A recurring theme in your life, right Duke? She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol right at her
M	DUKE	Move and I'll blow her away. Get the briefcase. Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the
M	ANA	Do it, Duke. .You already killed me once. And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake- Snake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting Hello brother. Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the moment to
F	SCARLETT	I believe you've got my luggage. Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air, Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the
M	PRESIDENT	How many warheads?
M	STAFFER #1	Four, Mr. President.
M	PRESIDENT	Any threats? Any demands?
M	STAFFER #1	None so far, sir.
M	STAFFER #2	We take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused, no clear goals. The President stops, glancing gravely back at his staff.

M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	As I have never forgotten what the French did to Clan McCullen.
M	THE DOCTOR	Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
M	ZARTAN	This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime.
M	THE DOCTOR	For you and me both.
M	ZARTAN	Eighteen months of studying the subject, learning the mannerisms, adopting his eating habits, losing sixty percent of my muscle mas...
M	THE DOCTOR	Your commitment has been inspiring. McCullen enters.
M	MCCULLEN	Gentlemen. About to get under way? Zartan raises his PDA.
M	ZARTAN	Once the ledgers are all square.
M	MCCULLEN	Check your account. Zartan checks the PDA. McCullen shakes his head.
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	It's always about the money.
M	ZARTAN	It's a useful tool. You should understand that. Ah! The transfer just hit my account. Zartan puts the PDA aside, leans back on the gurney and Let's do this. The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS
M	YOUNG STORM SHADOW	Thief ! He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake-
M	HARD MASTER (O.S.)	Enough! Storm Shadow! A Ninja Master steps forward. Storm Shadow turns to him.
M	YOUNG STORM SHADOW	Father, he was stealing. We need to call the magistrate.
M	HARD MASTER	He is hungry. We need to invite him in and show him the way.
M	STORM SHADOW	He's a cur! A Frenchie!
M	HARD MASTER	He doesn't fight like one. The two young warriors glare at one another.
M	HARD MASTER (CONT'D)	Now what shall be your clan name? Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes AND WE FLASH BACK TO: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands
F	RIPCORD	Jesus, you okay?
F	SCARLETT	I'm fine.
F	RIPCORD	You're not fine, let me look at that.
F	SCARLETT	I looked at it, it's fine.
F	RIPCORD	Take it easy, just trying to help.
F	SCARLETT	I know what you're trying to do.
F	RIPCORD	And what is that exactly?
F	SCARLETT	I don't have time for this.
F	RIPCORD	You know, not every guy you meet is an asshole. You do know that, don't you? Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her,
F	SCARLETT	It's not you, I... I didn't really want anyone to... see me in here.
F	RIPCORD	Why not?
F	SCARLETT	I don't know. All the people we lost last night. General Hawk... My neck is not that important.
F	RIPCORD	You almost died. You're allowed to be concerned.
F	SCARLETT	First fight I've lost since I was a kid. My father would be... he was my instructor.
F	RIPCORD	Think he's be disappointed.
F	SCARLETT	He taught me to win.
F	RIPCORD	I don't know how you teach anybody to win at everything every time. But I do know you can teach someone to get up when they get knocked down. Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Look at you. Still here. Maybe this is what he wanted you to learn. Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	But of course, that would be an emotional response, one that can't be explained or quantified. Ripcord turns and heads for the door. Scarlett watches him.
F	SCARLETT	We're not a couple. Snake-Eyes and me. We're... close, he's like a brother, but... we're not a couple. Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.
M	HAWK	Can you kill her? And then WE FLASHBACK TO: Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on That ought to hold you.
M	DUKE	Graveyard dead.
F	SCARLETT	Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford. They've been surgically implanted behind the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks.
M	DUKE	Like what?
F	SCARLETT	Theoretically, the possibilities are endless. Increase their speed, agility, resilience. You program, they perform. That's the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much whatever you want it to.
M	DUKE	Mind control?
F	SCARLETT	I don't see why not.
M	DUKE	Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be McCullen. Doing an inside job on his own warheads.
F	SCARLETT	You may be right. Maybe he needed NATO to pay for his R D.
F	RIPCORD	The weapons case! Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Remember he had us open the case for him. Remember that?
F	SCARLETT	What about it?
F	RIPCORD	I'll bet that code he gave us like re-activated the tracking beacon or something. Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense.
M	DUKE	And who says you're not a thinker. All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.
M	BREAKER	I think I found her...
M	DUKE	Yeah, you found her all right.
M	BREAKER	Her name is Ana DeCobray now, Baroness if you're feeling formal.
F	RIPCORD	Wow, she traded up, huh? I mean... financially.
M	DUKE	Who is he?
M	BREAKER	Baron DeCobray. Big shot French scientist. Runs a lab in Paris.
F	SCARLETT	Lab? Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a
M	BREAKER	Particle accelerator.
F	SCARLETT	They're gonna use him to weaponize the warheads.
M	DUKE	That's where she's going.
M	HEAVY DUTY	Who likes croissants?
M	DUKE	Per the briefing, we fast rope in, form up and assault the main lab... Rex--uh, .the science officer, stays back with Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the building. Alpha holds the perimeter while science officer secures the WMDs. Five minutes before extraction and the airstrike. The squad nods. Duke looks to Rex again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show Double Bubble? Rex takes it. Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex.
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	Always helps me. You good?
M	REX	Yeah... They chew their gum.
M	DUKE	Go, Bravo. Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	You're good to go, Rex. You don't find it in four minutes, get out of there, because that house won't be standing in five. I already called for the air strike. Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke, We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle,
F	RIPCORD	I've gotta level with ya!
M	DUKE	I hate it when you level with me.
F	RIPCORD	Gonna be a long five minutes. Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	I love that sound... But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.
M	DUKE	No, no, no... It's too soon. ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	Rex. Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions
F	RIPCORD	Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've got wounded! And incoming enemy! Lots of 'em!
M	DUKE	I can't.
F	RIPCORD	Nothing you can do. Come on...! Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from
M	SECURITY GUARD	Good Morning. Baroness.
M	ANA	Good morning. Gene. My husband's expecting me.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Absolument. The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab LAB TECHNICIANS swarm all over it, taking readings and making
M	DECOBRAY	Ana...? I need you to do something for me and I don't have much time.
M	DECOBRAY	Who is this? She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on
M	DECOBRAY (CONT'D)	I don't understand... what are these things? What's going on?
M	ANA	They're warheads, dear. And I need you to weaponize them for me... .or we'll kill everyone in here. DeCobray stares at her, shocked. He looks at Storm Shadow who
M	DECOBRAY	This is a civilian laboratory. We don't have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing...
M	ANA	The protocols are in the case. I told you, I don't have much time. DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case.
F	SCARLETT	Heavy D and Breaker will stay in the Brawler, watch our back. The rest of us will break into the lab with the accelerator suits. Once the warheads are weaponized, they'll be extremely volatile. We can't afford to let any of them go off inside the city. Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.
F	RIPCORD	What about you? Don't you get a suit? Snake-Eyes just looks at him, "Are you kidding me?"
F	SCARLETT	He doesn't need one.
M	DECOBRAY	Firing. DeCobray hits a switch. The PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and Technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the
M	DECOBRAY (CONT'D)	Careful... they're alive.
M	ANA	Thank you, Leon.
M	DECOBRAY	I think I have never seen the face of evil until I looked at you now. Ana looks at him and falters, something in his words piercing
M	ANA	Adieu. DeCobray watches her go, then opens the envelope. We see the
M	HEAVY DUTY	There it is.
M	BREAKER	That's them! Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto
F	SCARLETT	Keep going! With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back
M	SCARLETT (CONT'D)	Don't worry about me, go and help Snake-Eyes! Duke doesn't need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs
M	BREAKER	Careful. They're worth millions of dollars... each.
F	RIPCORD	Millions of dollars, got it. He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	Sorry! Excusem moil Won't happen again. Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke.
M	BREAKER	Christ, they just shot right through a bus! And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following. She sits
M	BREAKER	They're turning the corner. Go through that building at 6 o'clock!
F	RIPCORD	There's no door!
M	BREAKER'S VOICE	Make one! Duke charges directly at the building. Ripcord reluctantly
M	STORM SHADOW	Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy if I let you die. Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.
M	ANA	How thoughtful.
F	SCARLETT	Look at the moves they're making, they're heading somewhere. Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.
M	BREAKER	This's their route from the lab. On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the Metal... Oh God...
M	SCARLETT'S VOICE	Guys, you have to stop them.
M	DUKE	Yeah, we're working on it.
M	SCARLETT'S VOICE	I mean right now. They're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower. Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.
F	RIPCORD	Oh, man... Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and
M	HEAVY DUTY/BREAKER	Holy shit... You guys okay?
M	DUKE	What happened to you?
F	RIPCORD	I went through the train. What happened to you?
M	DUKE	I jumped over it.
F	RIPCORD	You can do that?
M	DUKE	Yeah, you didn't know? INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls
M	DUKE (CONT'D)	C'mon! Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.
F	RIPCORD	How do you say "we're the good guys" in French? Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first
F	SCARLETT	Don't shoot! We're a special anti- terrorist unit! There's a bomb up there! POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them. A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils. ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her
F	RIPCORD	Where you going?
M	DUKE	Each warhead has a kill switch.
F	RIPCORD	It's too late! We gotta get off this thing!
M	DUKE	Those nano-mites will level the entire city! Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.
M	ANA	Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds. IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of With the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.
M	BREAKER	Come on! He hauls-ass.
M	ANA	You just saved Paris. Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops
F	RIPCORD	What are you doing?
M	BREAKER	Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
F	SCARLETT	The brain survives for a couple of minutes after death. We can read his most recent memories.
F	RIPCORD	Can you find Duke?
M	BREAKER	If this guy remembers the way home we can. INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.
M	MCCULLEN	Destroy that unit immediately. The Doctor removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo-
M	HEAVY DUTY	He's still alive!
F	SCARLETT	He's not alive.
M	HEAVY DUTY	You ever seen a dead guy do that?
F	SCARLETT	They activated a self-destruct. The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands
M	BREAKER	Nano-mites!
F	RIPCORD	They're eating him!
F	SCARLETT	Hurry, Breaker! But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are
F	RIPCORD	You did the best you could.
M	BREAKER	Relax, I got it.

M	BREAKER	This is bigger than Duke.
F	RIPCORD	What if it was one of you? What if they had Heavy or Scarlett, what would you do? The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place.
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	We're not doing Duke a damned bit of good sitting here. If it was reversed, Duke would be kicking down every door between here and the freakin' moon 'til he found me.
F	SCARLETT	And we'll do the same for him as soon as we get out of here. She has a thought and turns to Breaker.
M	SCARLETT (CONT'D)	Partial? You said partial latitude and longitude.
M	BREAKER	We only got the one coordinate-- 90 degrees, then the image went to snow.
F	SCARLETT	Maybe it was the whole coordinate, just 90 degrees latitude. Before the image went to snow,...it's the polar ice cap.
F	RIPCORD	They did away with the guillotine, right? They arrive at a door. The door is opened to reveal a man in
M	BREAKER	General! Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily.
M	HEAVY DUTY	How long before we're released?
M	HAWK	The French government is allowing you to leave on the condition that none of you ever return. Other agencies will be handling this from here on.
M	SCARLETT/RIPCORD	What?!
M	HAWK	The heads of state of every member of GI JOE are recalling their operatives. We are now considered a rogue unit, uncontrollable. Shut down. We're to report to Washington for debriefing. Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door.
F	RIPCORD	That's it? They've got Duke! Hawk stops his wheelchair, turns to them.
M	HAWK	I said you were to report to Washington. I didn't say when, or which route to take.
F	SCARLETT	Maybe a northern one. Hawk smiles and wheels out the door.
M	ANA	He thinks I should kill you.
M	DUKE	Why don't you?
M	ANA	James wants to meet you in person.
M	DUKE	James?
M	ANA	Mr McCullen.
M	DUKE	Ana listen--
M	ANA	--Talk softly, or he'll tazer you again.
M	DUKE	Loosen these, he'll never taser anything again. She taps the bonds on his wrists.
M	ANA	I should've thought of this before. They almost share a smile.
M	DUKE	Let me get this straight. You're with McCullen. You're married to that Baron. And you claim you're still in love with me.
M	ANA	I'm a complex woman.
M	DUKE	Maybe you just don't know who you are anymore.
M	ANA	Who I was died long ago.
M	DUKE	No, this isn't you, I still see the person I loved behind your eyes. Her eyes soften for a moment.
M	ANA	Tell me what she was like.
M	DUKE	She was smart, and funny. She was loyal as hell. She loved those she was close with, me, her brother... I did my best. With Rex. I'm sorry. He was my responsibility. I should have... It's why I left, Ana. Why I couldn't be with you. You were in so much pain... I thought the sight of me just give you more. She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then... a
M	ANA	It doesn't matter now.
M	DUKE	No, it matters very much. We have the chance to make things right.
M	ANA	Nothing will ever be right again. Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart. WE PUSH IN ON Parked on a nearby road is a lone car. Duke sits inside it,
M	ANA	NO! McCullen has plans for him! Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and
M	ANA (CONT'D)	Enough! Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down,
M	STORM SHADOW	And what was your plan? Run three thousand miles across the ice? He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder. Duke sucks it up.
M	STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)	Stupid soldier. Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard.
M	HEAVY DUTY	That's a lotta ice.
F	RIPCORD	It's gonna be like trying to find whale spit in the ocean. Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece.
M	BREAKER	That's strange.
F	SCARLETT	What?
M	BREAKER	When they stole the weapons case, I set my suit to scan for the tracker beacon in case it came back on, and it just came back on. Ripcord just smiles.
F	RIPCORD	That's my boy. Certain work needs to be done away from the public eye.
M	MCCULLEN	Take them to the drones. I want them ready to launch in one hour.
M	STORM SHADOW	It will be done. And only then does McCullen greet Ana.
M	MCCULLEN	My beautiful Lady of the Lake... He kisses her. Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	This bother you? Duke says nothing, so McCullen steps closer.
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	Isn't it funny, with the entire balance of power in the world about to shift, a couple of guys can still have a stare down over who gets the girl. Duke takes the opportunity to HEAD BUTT McCullen. The Neo- The interesting thing about my Neo- Vipers is they still think the same thoughts they always did, they just can't act on them anymore. Instead, they do what I want. I imagine that must be very frustrating. He gets right down in Duke's face.
M	MCCULLEN (CONT'D)	I'm going to make you very unhappy.
M	DUKE	I'm already happy. McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted
M	DUKE	What're you gonna do with the warheads?
M	MCCULLEN	You take to your training well, that's good. Still trying to develop information. Still planning to escape and stope me. Moments from now, you'll see that won't ever happen.
M	DUKE	Then you won't mind telling me.
M	MCCULLEN	Isn't it clear? I'm a business man. I'm going to use them.
M	DUKE	Millions of people are gonna die if you launch those warheads. What is it you want, McCullen?
M	MCCULLEN	Merely to strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet. Only then will they look up to the man who wields the most power, and obey him.
M	MCCULLEN	Meet the genius behind all my nanotechnology.
M	THE DOCTOR	My genius lies only in taking what others created to the logical next steps. All modern gains in science are made through theft.
M	MCCULLEN	You'll have to excuse his modesty, when I found him, he was --
M	THE DOCTOR	--Another "recruit"?
M	MCCULLEN	Albeit a rather unwilling one. The Doctor's nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions. When you wake up, you'll be working for me, and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze.
M	THE DOCTOR	I'll prepare him for the surgery. The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him
M	BREAKER (V.0.)	Picture's coming on line now.
F	SCARLETT	It's an underwater facility...
M	HEAVY DUTY	McCullen's home away from home.
F	RIPCORD	Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere.
F	SCARLETT	Wait, what's that? Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.
M	BREAKER	Oh, Jesus...That's an automated, phased array turbo-pulse battery. A really big gun.
F	SCARLETT	Could it take out our sub?
M	BREAKER	That thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously.
F	SCARLETT	Then that's our first objective.
F	RIPCORD	No, no. Duke's our first objective.
F	SCARLETT	The main force can't attack as long as that cannon's online.
M	HEAVY DUTY	How you figure getting it offline? Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor.
F	SCARLETT	Elevator cables. They've got a surface entrance. Shipwreck? She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR "SHIPWRECK"
M	SHIPWRECK	Going up, senorita? Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor.
F	SCARLETT	Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon. Heavy D, as soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside.
M	HEAVY DUTY	Go, Joes...
M	TECHNICIAN	All drones prepared and ready, Sir.
M	MCCULLEN	Good, commence the launch sequence immediately. is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face?
F	RIPCORD	That McCullen's got some gadgets. Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana
M	BREAKER	Maybe we could slide down. Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful
F	SCARLETT	The arctic water would kill us.
M	TECHNICIAN	Three... two... one... ignite primary engines. The entire control room begins to shake. The screens fill Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a
M	TECHNICIAN	We lost one.
M	MCCULLEN	Lost one? What do you mean?
M	TECHNICIAN	Bird Three is down, Sir. McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged. Storm Shadow smiles.
M	STORM SHADOW	We're under attack.
M	MCCULLEN	Alert all defences. Charge up the pulse cannon. He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room.
M	BREAKER	What about the other two?
F	RIPCORD	We find the kill switches and short out the nano-mites.
M	BREAKER	They're already way out of range.
F	SCARLETT	Then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down. That's me.
F	SCARLETT	Can you even fly this thing?
F	RIPCORD	I can fly anything. You just track those warheads and guide me in. We don't have long until they hit.
F	SCARLETT	Ripcord? He glances at her, a moment between them. Then she presses
M	SCARLETT (CONT'D)	Good luck.
F	RIPCORD	Do me a favor? Save Duke. She gives him a nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself.
M	THE DOCTOR	The atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city. Seventy percent... Did you know that, Duke? Duke looks at him, something familiar.
M	REX	There was a bank situated less than one hundred yards from Ground Zero, destroyed of course. Only one thing survived. It's four bank vaults. And when those vaults were opened, they discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed.
M	DUKE	Who are you?
M	THE DOCTOR	Of course, the vault I took shelter in wasn't that well-made. He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the mask to reveal
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	Double Bubble? Duke is beyond shocked.
M	DUKE	Rex... Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask You sonuvabitch... Ana buried you.
M	THE DOCTOR	A moving ceremony, I'm sure. The three volley salute. The flag on the coffin.
M	DUKE	Why? .Why didn't you come in...?
M	THE DOCTOR	Because I found out the truth...
M	BRAVE SOLDIER	Intel says the lab's in the basement. Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door. They lead the way down a
M	SCIENTIST	Are you going to shoot me?... Rex doesn't respond. We knew you were coming. But I couldn't walk away from it... Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting.
M	REX	Stay where you are. His gun up, he finds a COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing
M	REX (CONT'D)	These aren't chemical or nuclear--
M	SCIENTIST	No. Something much... better.
M	RES	This is beyond anything... This is light years ahead of anyone in the field.
M	SCIENTIST	You see why I couldn't leave. Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an
M	SCIENTIST (CONT'D)	If we live, I'll show you everything...
M	THE DOCTOR	The man who created this technology was not our enemy. In fact, he was hired by our very own government to create it. When it was deemed too unethical, they sent us to kill him. He didn't survive the blast. But I... lived. And I escaped with his research. Unfortunately I tested it on myself first, and lost my lungs and vocal chords in the process. But now I've perfected it, and you will get a first-hand experience.
M	DUKE	Does Ana know about this, about you?
M	THE DOCTOR	No... and she never will. He glances at the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes.
M	DUKE	You sick bastard... you did this to your own sister? I loved my sister! Do you have any idea the state she was in? Me dead. You AWOL. Depression, drugs.
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	So, I had her brought here, gave her a way to deal with her pain, gave her purpose. Made her strong. I gave her a new life, Duke.
M	DUKE	Why work for McCullen?
M	THE DOCTOR	He saved my life, for starters. Now to mention infinite resources to work in the field of my choosing.
M	DUKE	That's bullshit. You could have had any job you wanted.
M	THE DOCTOR	I didn't want any job. You can't play nice with science, Duke. It's sometimes necessary to experiment, to fail, even to destroy to attain a goal. It's a fact that McCullen has the guts to embrace.
M	DUKE	Everything she's done, everything she's become, started because she thought you died that day.
M	THE DOCTOR	And because you then abandoned her, let's not forget that part. And with that, he leaves Duke to the SMART ROBOTS, which
F	SCARLETT	It's pressure plated and laser protected. Anyway around it?
M	BREAKER	No. Any object larger than a quarter will fry your britches. Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps forward Then, with incredible strength, he proceeds to walk across
M	BREAKER (CONT'D)	What you'll have to do is rewire the laser panel's brain by-- --Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while
M	BREAKER (CONT'D)	.or you cold just stab it.
M	ANA	I don't have much time. She rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other,
M	DUKE	Ana! Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his PDA, McCullen
M	HEAVY DUTY	Let's get in this fight.
M	BREAKER	Okay, I've got a lock on the two remaining warheads. Target one is Moscow! Target Two is Washington!
F	SCARLETT	Give Ripcord the coordinates. He spins, but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm,
M	SHIPWRECK	The hull's been ruptured!
M	HEAVY DUTY	Everyone into the attack boats!
M	HEAVY DUTY	Keep tight everybody. He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis
M	MCCULLEN	Is she still alive?
M	THE DOCTOR	For now.
M	MCCULLEN	You said this couldn't happen.
M	THE DOCTOR	I didn't think it could. I've never seen anyone defeat the programming, even momentarily. Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's PISTOLS and
M	THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	If I press this, Ana dies.
M	DUKE	Put it down.
M	THE DOCTOR	Your choice, Duke.
M	DUKE	Put it down! The Doctor doesn't move. McCullen watches the stand-off his
F	RIPCORD	I see it, dead ahead.
M	BREAKER	You have to knock it down before it re-enters the atmosphere so the nano-mites don't reach the ground.
F	RIPCORD	Uh, I've got a problem. The fire controls are not in here.
M	BREAKER'S VOICE	What do you mean, not in there?
F	RIPCORD	I mean I can't see them anywhere!
F	SCARLETT	It's gotta be voice-activated.
M	RIPCORD'S VOICE	What?
F	SCARLETT	You have to say the words into your flight helmet.
F	RIPCORD	Fire! Shoot! Blast away! Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the
M	RIPCORD'S VOICE	Nothing's happening!
M	BREAKER	Must be a different language.
F	SCARLETT	Try "teine".
M	RIPCORD'S VOICE	What?
F	SCARLETT	It's Scottish for fire.
F	RIPCORD	Teine.
F	SCARLETT	Listen to my voice, "Teine".
F	RIPCORD	Teine! Teine! Teine! It's not working!
M	SCARLETT'S VOICE	That's because you're not saying it right!
F	RIPCORD	How many different ways you want me to say it?
M	SCARLETT'S VOICE	One way! The right way! Teine!
F	RIPCORD	Teine! And at last the PULSE LASER fires. Blasting the missile out
M	BREAKER	Nice work, Ace. You just saved Moscow.
F	RIPCORD	Just doing my job. Guide me to the other drone...
M	RIPCORD (CONT'D)	.man, I freakin' saved Moscow!
M	PRESIDENT	How soon will it strike the city?
M	STAFFER	Seventeen minutes, Sir.
M	PRESIDENT	This will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen. As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES
M	SHIPWRECK	That cannon's going to kill us all.
M	HEAVY DUTY	My guy will take care of it, trust me. All of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY
M	STAFFER	It seems somebody's shot down the warhead heading for Moscow.
M	PRESIDENT	Thank God... As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED --A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room. An
F	RIPCORD	Second drone in my sights.
M	BREAKER	Hurry, Rip. You've only got thirty seconds before it enters the lower atmosphere.
F	RIPCORD	Taine! But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.
M	SCARLETT'S VOICE	Teine! Teine!
F	RIPCORD	Don't yell at me!
M	SCARLETT'S VOICE	Teine. Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT
F	RIPCORD	Teine! The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which
M	BREAKER	You missed! The warhead has entered the lower atmosphere!
M	MCCULLEN	Did you think she loved you?
M	DUKE	Stay back!
M	MCCULLEN	Did you imagine your life with her?
M	DUKE	I said stay back!
M	THE DOCTOR	Don't you know you've lost, Duke?
M	DUKE	All I know is that neither of you deserves her. McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand--
M	BREAKER	You're too close, Rip. Back up.
F	RIPCORD	Actually, I think I'm just about close enough... .teine. The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES right
F	SCARLETT	Ripcord? What happened? Rip!
M	BREAKER	He's taking the nano-mites back up into the upper atmosphere.
F	RIPCORD	Cur magh! The canopy explodes. Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere
M	BREAKER	He did it... He actually did it...
F	SCARLETT	Ripcord? Talk to me...Ripcord! Still nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then:
M	RIPCORD'S VOICE	I asked you not to yell at me. Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker.
F	SCARLETT	What happened? Are you okay?
M	RIPCORD'S VOICE	Yeah, did it work?
F	SCARLETT	Yes...yes, it worked.
F	RIPCORD	Good...cause I think I'm about to get arrested.
M	SNAKE-EYES	Master! Other NINJAS come flooding in.
M	NINJA #1	That's Storm Shadow's sword!
M	NINJA #2	There! There's the murderer! Snake-Eyes spins to see Storm Shadow climb up the side of the
M	STORM SHADOW	You took your vow of silence to avenge our Master. But now you will die without a word. The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for
M	SNAKE-EYES	Father always feared it would come to this. EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now. Snake-Eyes stumbles
M	HEAVY DUTY	Turbo-laser is down! He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It
M	BREAKER	Energy overload in the phased array battery. Power subsystems are going critical.
F	SCARLETT	Let's get out of here! Scarlett grabs Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls
F	SCARLETT	Snake! Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks Scarlett in the eyes.
M	SNAKE-EYES	.he's dead. She knows who he means, she gives him a grim smile. And
M	HEAVY DUTY	We got a runner! Cut him off! All of a sudden, the whole damn facility EXPLODES.
M	SHIPWRECK	All other targets neutralized.
M	MCCULLEN	I guess I should thank you, Doctor. The Doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held PDA.
M	THE DOCTOR	I want you to call me... Commander. And from now on, I'll be on a first name basis with you, Destro. McCullen's silver face goes blank.
M	MCCULLEN	Yes, Commander.
M	SCIENTIST	Physically, she's fine. But without the correctly-coded kill frequency, we can't short them out.
M	DUKE	There's nothing you can do?
M	SCIENTIST	Only the man who put them in there has the correct code. Duke considers this carefully, staring at Ana.
M	DUKE	I'll visit you.
M	ANA	I won't be here long.
M	DUKE	You'll be here for the rest of your life, Ana. She looks at him, her face softening.
M	ANA	Duke?
M	DUKE	I'm here.
M	ANA	After all I've done, .you can't save me, .it's too late. A BEAT passes between them.
M	DUKE	I'll visit you. And for a moment, she appears to crack... but then a
M	ANA	You know, this has only just begun. She touches his face, then the PRISON BARS slam shut between
M	HAWK	With GI JOE reinstated, would you boys like to stay on awhile?
M	DUKE	What do you say, Rip? Ripcord looks at Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.
F	RIPCORD	I'm good. They all laugh. Rip steps up to her. So how do you feel about this?
F	SCARLETT	I feel very... emotional. Duke smiles and the Joes climb aboard as the platform rises.
