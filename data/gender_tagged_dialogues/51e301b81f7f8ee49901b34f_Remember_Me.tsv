M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BLONDE	Hello?
M	TYLER	Yeah... Of course. I'm on my way. I know...I know...I know...I know.
M	TYLER V/O	Gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it...
M	TYLER V/O	...I tend to agree with the first part.
M	TYLER	Hello, your majesty. How are you?
F	DIANE	I'm fine... you look good...
M	TYLER	Thanks for organizing everybody.
F	CAROLINE	You smell like Listerine and beer.
M	CHARLES	You couldn't wear a tie?
M	TYLER	Could have.
F	DIANE	...This is nice... I think it's nice that we still do this...
F	CAROLINE	Mom.
F	DIANE	I forgot. I'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael would like that we still do this.
F	DIANE	Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait?
F	CAROLINE	Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait?
M	TYLER	Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait?
F	DIANE	You two. I quit.
F	CAROLINE	...She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler.
M	TYLER	Young Whistler... good... 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history.
F	DIANE	She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious.
F	CAROLINE	I would be the youngest one, ever, practically...
M	CHARLES	Tyler, would you please pass the butter?
F	DIANE	Caroline was speaking.
M	TYLER	Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like this?
M	CHARLES	Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed?
F	CAROLINE	I'm okay.
M	CHARLES	I didn't mean to change the subject.
M	TYLER	What was the subject?
M	CHARLES	Excuse me?
M	TYLER	The subject we were discussing. What was it?
M	CHARLES	Now's not the time for your heroics Tyler
M	TYLER	No. It's the perfect time.
M	TYLER	Do you need me to take you anywhere?
F	CAROLINE	I'll stay with mom.
M	TYLER	Then I'll see you after school.
F	CAROLINE	Kay.
M	HOSTESS	Eat something.
M	TYLER	Yes, ma'am.
F	AIDAN	I sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.
M	TYLER	You sold my who? ...What?
F	AIDAN	That voluptuous, delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed this morning... I sold her a toothbrush. Got three bucks.
M	TYLER	...Congratulations?
F	AIDAN	Are in order, yes. Because that sale inspired our newest business venture: "The S.L.U.T."
M	TYLER	I was unaware we had a previous business venture.
F	AIDAN	'Single Lady's Universal Tote'. the one-night-stand travel for women. We throw in some toiletries, cell phone cab numbers. Retail it at maybe do an infomercial.
M	TYLER	you think women would buy this? money?
F	AIDAN	one-night-stands happen... It's part of life... like stubbing toe. Sometimes you misjudge a and bend back your pinky other times you wake up in a dorm wearing a field tee shirt wondering why your smell like cinnamon...
M	TYLER	course. Yes.
F	AIDAN	underestimate the novelty market. Think about it... of giving that token slutty a ten-inch purple dildo for birthday, you hook her up with SLUT." Everyone has a laugh the implication that she'll use it someday remains. do you say? Are you down?
M	TYLER	down with getting you on some of medication.
F	AIDAN	cynical...just at some point in history people had a conversation just this about the light bulb. One them went on to fame and fortune the other one probably went to at Mickey D's or something.
M	TYLER	Denny's. Denny's was big in the century. It's an unfortunate reality but a reality nonetheless ...
M	PROFESSOR	...in the wake of terrorist attacks these insurance company actuaries are provided a unique opportunity to raise premiums and profits to protect against events that will likely never occur again...
M	GIRL	Isn't that also an ethical question?
M	UPTIGHT MOMMY	Why don't we make this a non- smoking statue?
F	CAROLINE	Yeah, Tyler . Why don't we make this a non-smoking statue?
F	CAROLINE	You promised you'd quit...
M	TYLER	I know.
F	CAROLINE	You're gonna get emphysema and then you're gonna have to drag an oxygen tank with you everywhere...
M	TYLER	You think that would be the worst part about having emphysema?
F	CAROLINE	Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the bathroom.
F	CAROLINE	Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna...like, listen to me?
M	TYLER	Dad loves you.
F	CAROLINE	So? You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them.
M	TYLER	You've got that right.
F	CAROLINE	Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a "yule tide homicide."
M	TYLER	That's because Aunt Sara drinks... You don't drink, right?
F	CAROLINE	Duh.
M	TYLER	So why would anyone wanna avoid you?
F	CAROLINE	Michael used to drink.
M	TYLER	Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21.
F	CAROLINE	You're 21. What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year? Get a suite. Couple of ladies. You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think?
M	TYLER	I think I'd rather be sodomized. Hey, it's your day.
F	AIDAN	What's the point? How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway? There's like...
M	AIDAN/TYLER	"Eight Miles of Books!"
M	TYLER	I don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together...
F	AIDAN	No shit?
M	TYLER	And ended up dead or in prison.
F	AIDAN	This is why chicks dig you.
F	AIDAN	Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me.
M	TYLER	Eh.
M	TYLER	Hey!
F	AIDAN	Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here.
M	AIDAN (cont'd)	I can't deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man. I'm ready to set up an intervention.
M	TYLER	You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking?
F	AIDAN	One drink. Come out for one drink.
M	TYLER	When's the last time you had one drink?
F	AIDAN	Hey, Megan!
F	AIDAN	You look great! Can I get two Heinekens?
F	MEGAN	Do. Not. Speak.
F	AIDAN	Is she mad at me or something?
M	TYLER	No no. Girls are like that when they're way into you.
F	AIDAN	Oh.
M	GIRL #1	Excuse me?
F	AIDAN	Well, hello...
M	GIRL #1	Could you take a picture for us?
F	AIDAN	My pleasure...
F	AIDAN	Thanks. You've met my roommate...
F	MEGAN	I hope you die.
M	TYLER	She's all over you. Cheers.
F	AIDAN	I love this street. I love this city. Where are you guys from, again?
M	AIDAN'S GIRL	Miami.
F	AIDAN	Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New York is it, man. God broke the mold when he made this city.
M	TYLER	You ever actually been to any of those places?
F	AIDAN	What's your point?
M	AIDAN'S GIRL	What are we doing? I'm freezing.
F	AIDAN	Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me.
M	VOICE O/S	Michael...Mi-i-chael!
M	AIDAN'S GIRL	Asshole.
M	AIDAN'S GIRL	Are you coming?
M	TYLER'S GIRL	Hold on, Lauren.
M	MUSICIAN#2	What's your problem?
M	NEANDERTHAL DRIVER	My problem? Keep your hands off my car, asshole.
M	MUSICIAN#2	Blow it out your ass, Guido.
M	MUSICIAN#1	Go back to Long Island.
M	NEANDERTHAL DRIVER	I'm from Queens, faggot
M	TYLER'S GIRL	So we were thinking we could go...
F	AIDAN	God damn it.
F	CRAIG	Cut those two loose.
M	LEO	Take a walk.
F	CRAIG	Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein?
F	CRAIG	Nice. You like to get high and hit women?
M	NEANDERTHAL#1	I don't even know the bitch.
F	CRAIG	How about you two?
M	MUSICIAN#1	It wasn't us, man!
M	NEANDERTHAL#1	That cocksucker kicked my car!
F	CRAIG	Shut up, genius.
M	MUSICIAN#1	Eat shit, pencil dick.
F	CRAIG	Alright. That's it. Everybody goes downtown.
M	TYLER	It wasn't them.
F	AIDAN	Tyler...
M	LEO	Take a walk, I said.
M	TYLER	Hey!
M	TYLER	They didn't do anything. They didn't start this. Those assholes did. Why do these guys have to go downtown?
F	CRAIG	What are you still doing here?
M	TYLER	This is bullshit. It was those gorillas who started this.
F	CRAIG	Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you think I give a shit?
M	TYLER	You're a police officer. You're supposed to.
F	CRAIG	It's a great relief to me, Mr. Roth, to know that you're on top of the situation. Now go the fuck home.
M	TYLER	How about you do your job?
M	ESCORTING OFFICER	You can have your call now.
M	TYLER	I'm good.
F	AIDAN	You're good? Thank God you're good.
F	AIDAN	What are you trying to do? What did you want from that cop guy?
M	TYLER	That was a messed up situation. Those guys...
M	TYLER	...Are pussies!
M	NEANDERTHAL#1 O/S	Faggot!
M	NEANDERTHAL#2 O/S	Candy-ass faggot!
M	NEANDERTHAL#3 O/S	Fag!
M	TYLER	There was no justice in that situation.
F	AIDAN	No justice. Okay, Green Hornet ... Lantern ... Asshole. You may not be actually matriculating in school, you may be having a nice time by yourself lurking in the stacks of your book store, but I actually plan on graduating, and having a career and a wife and a girlfriend and a divorce and a mid-life stalking episode and erectile dysfunction, and I will thank you to keep your complexes and nihilistic bullshit...
M	TYLER	Did you just say "nihilistic"?
F	AIDAN	Yeah. I got it off a cereal box.
M	ESCORTING OFFICER	Roth, Brewer.
F	AIDAN	Yeah, I called your dad's office. Sue me.
F	ALLY	So when would that be available?...No, that's sooner than I'd thought. And is there any kind of deposit?.. Okay.
F	ALLY	I'll call you back. Thanks.
F	ALLY	What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight?
F	CRAIG	Breathe.
F	ALLY	Did you?
F	CRAIG	I did. I'm breathing right now. Who was that?
F	ALLY	The lady from student housing. We talked about it. Remember?
F	CRAIG	Sure.
F	ALLY	Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me.
F	CRAIG	I'll drive you.
F	ALLY	Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it.
F	ALLY	You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench.
F	ALLY	This drive is too long.
M	THE RECEPTIONIST	You know you can't smoke in here.
M	TYLER	So what's with the ash tray?
M	THE RECEPTIONIST	It completes the room.
M	TYLER	Tease.
M	JANINE O/S	Tyler...
F	JANINE	He's ready for you.
F	JANINE	You're too skinny. And you smell like french fries and cigarettes.
M	TYLER	Nice to see you too.
F	JANINE	You want me to lie?
F	JANINE	Try not to give him a heart attack.
M	TYLER	Okay.
M	TYLER	I came to see how much it costs, because I'm giving you the money back.
M	CHARLES	How much what costs?
M	TYLER	That lawyer.
M	CHARLES	Ah. That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450 dollars an hour.
M	TYLER	Christ.
M	CHARLES	Tell me about it.
M	TYLER	I wanted to make sure you understood it wasn't me who called you.
M	CHARLES	I understand. You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail I don't want to be bailed out of anything.
M	TYLER	I'll get an invoice from Janine.
M	TYLER	Hey.
M	TYLER	Excuse us, we're due in surgery.
F	CAROLINE	What happened to your face?
M	TYLER	Horrible threshing accident.
F	CAROLINE	You're so retarded.
M	TYLER	Don't mock the afflicted. Here, I brought you something.
M	TYLER	This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing.
F	CAROLINE	Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where are we meeting mom?
M	TYLER	Guggenheim. What's up with those girls?
F	CAROLINE	I just...they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out.
M	TYLER	When you're drawing?
F	CAROLINE	Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today. And everybody laughed and they all think I'm a freak of nature.
M	TYLER	Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature."
M	TYLER	Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature". Sacre Bleu. French Toast.
F	CAROLINE	What are you going to tell mom about your face?
M	TYLER	I finally found something I'm good at?
F	AIDAN	...I know by every numerical measurement I didn't pass but what I was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass. My commitment to effort. My commitment to commitment...Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus.
F	AIDAN	I mean... uh... life's only about what we put into it. It's about people. And what they put into it. And I'm -- ah, screw it.
F	AIDAN	He's got a daughter.
M	TYLER	Who?
F	AIDAN	The cop... The cop who busted your face all up. He's got a daughter. And she's hot! I smell revenge!
M	TYLER	Revenge. What do you want me to do, kidnap her?
F	AIDAN	You introduce yourself...go on a few dates...be your charming, gentlemanly self... And then, flip the script.
M	TYLER	What does that mean? Screw her brains out and make her call you daddy. Steal her underwear and sell it on ebay. Put her in Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and post them on her high school's home page. I don't know. Be creative.
M	TYLER	You should be incarcerated on general principle.
F	AIDAN	Hey. What happened to you was very emasculating. Tell me you don't want to get that asshole and I'll drop it.
M	TYLER	I don't want to get that asshole.
F	AIDAN	Just meet her.
M	TYLER	I don't want to meet her.
F	AIDAN	She's cute.
M	TYLER	I don't care.
F	AIDAN	You're meeting her.
M	TYLER	I'm not meeting her.
M	TYLER	This is one of those moments I'm already regretting.
F	AIDAN	She was here yesterday. What am I supposed to say to this girl? "Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?"
F	AIDAN	Well don't call her doll face.
F	AIDAN	There. The brunette.
M	TYLER	I know her. I mean, I don't know her, but, I've seen her. She's in my global politics class.
F	AIDAN	There you go! Something to open with. Now get over there.
F	AIDAN	Shazam!
M	TYLER	Excuse me?
M	TYLER	My name's Tyler Roth. I was wondering if I could bother you for a minute?
F	ALLY	You're already bothering me.
M	TYLER	Um, I'm doing kind of a sociological experiment...I was hoping you could help me out.
F	ALLY	What are you, kidding me?
M	TYLER	No, I... may I ask your name?
F	ALLY	Anonymous. It's Greek. It means "you don't have a shot".
M	TYLER	Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction?
F	ALLY	Subtle.
M	TYLER	I have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.
F	ALLY	Ah.
M	TYLER	He's my roommate. And I've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject, but I'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think?
F	ALLY	Who else do you plan on asking?
M	TYLER	No one here. The parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties.
F	ALLY	I'm nineteen.
M	TYLER	In their late teens. Well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and I've run out of those big foam fingers, so I was thinking maybe I could take you out some night?
M	TYLER	Or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation.
F	ALLY	I don't date sociology majors... they're a rowdy bunch.
M	TYLER	Indeed they are. Lucky for you, I'm undecided.
F	ALLY	About what?
M	TYLER	Everything.
F	ALLY	I'm Ally.
M	CHUBBY GIRL	Kiss ass freak.
F	CRAIG	Don't be mad...
F	ALLY	Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already. You always cry.
M	CRAIG O/S	I do not.
F	ALLY	It's embarrassing.
F	ALLY	Hello?
M	TYLER	Hey. It's Tyler.
F	ALLY	Hi.
M	TYLER	You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be devastated.
F	ALLY	No... I...I was just...
M	TYLER	You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V.
F	ALLY	No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm just...getting dressed.
F	ALLY	And I'm going to meet you at the place at..what time again?
M	TYLER	Eight.
F	ALLY	Right...yes. Eight...okay.
F	ALLY	Shit.
F	ALLY	I'm going out.
F	CRAIG	I can see that.
F	ALLY	Well, you're a trained investigator.
F	CRAIG	Who are you going with?
F	ALLY	A boy from school.
F	CRAIG	Okay.
F	ALLY	I wasn't asking for permission.
F	CRAIG	I know. Have a good time. Here's cab fare.
F	ALLY	Thanks.
F	CRAIG	Should I wait up?
F	ALLY	Dad.
F	ALLY	What desserts do you have?
M	WAITER	Dessert special fried bananas a la mode.
F	ALLY	Great, I'll have that. A glass of skim milk. Then the mussels, please.
M	TYLER	Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks.
F	ALLY	I have my dessert first.
M	TYLER	Is this a political statement? A medical condition?
F	ALLY	I just don't see the point in waiting for something I know I want and am going to have. What if I die eating my mussels?
M	TYLER	Is that probable?
F	ALLY	It's possible. If an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant, I'd die without having eaten the thing I wanted most.
M	TYLER	But the odds are, I mean...
F	ALLY	Fine. I'll tell you what, you guarantee me. Swear to me on your eternal soul that I'll make it through my entrée. And I'll wait.
F	ALLY	Before you answer, keep in mind, if I die, you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me, but denied me my last indulgence. My last wish. Are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point?
F	ALLY	Don't worry. I'll share.
F	ALLY	Really?
F	ALLY	I had a nice time.
M	TYLER	You had a nice time or you're having a nice time?
M	TYLER	Because if you're having one, why rush to end it? AFTER
M	TYLER	Did I tell you I'm Caucasian?
F	ALLY	Apparently.
F	ALLY	Can't we just stroll while I feed you ice cream with fireworks in the background?
M	TYLER	No. If I stop, he wins.
F	ALLY	Who, the attendant?
M	TYLER	No, the frigging Giant Panda.
F	ALLY	I don't know what you're smiling about.
M	TYLER	I won.
F	ALLY	Paying off the attendant is not winning... It's cheating.
M	TYLER	I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great.
F	ALLY	Aha. By the way, what happened to your eye?
M	TYLER	Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight.
F	ALLY	How butch.
M	TYLER	I know. I'm practically a pirate.
F	ALLY	Okay, Captain Morgan...
M	TYLER	You've got some serious timing.
M	ALL	It's getting late.
M	TYLER	I'll walk you to the train.
F	ALLY	I'll take a cab.
F	ALLY	Thanks.
F	ALLY	Not tonight. Not never... just... not tonight.
M	CAB DRIVER	We goin' or what?
F	ALLY	Hey! Turn on the meter.
M	TYLER	So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid... yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night... no. Ally considers.
F	ALLY	You're really weird.
F	ALLY	I'm going to Queens and I don't wanna hear about it.
M	TYLER	Happy end of sixth grade!
F	CAROLINE	Finally.
F	CAROLINE	They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt...
M	TYLER	I heard.
F	CAROLINE	It's very prestigious due to my artistic greatness.
M	TYLER	Don't pretend. I know you're proud. You should be.
F	CAROLINE	There's, like, a thing...
M	TYLER	A thing?
F	CAROLINE	A show where you show what you've done and stuff. Will you come?
M	TYLER	Let me check my book. Abso-freaking- lutely. I'm camping out. I'm sleeping there the night before.
F	CAROLINE	You're so retarded. Mom's been hyperventilating with joy.
M	TYLER	Good. I'm sure Les was...
M	TYLER/CAROLINE	"Really supportive"!
F	CAROLINE	Your school's over, right?
M	TYLER	Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les get the beach house again?
F	CAROLINE	Yup. What are we going to do for your birthday?
M	TYLER	Nothing.
F	CAROLINE	Can we have a party?
M	TYLER	No.
F	CAROLINE	A little one? At Mom's? With Aidan. I'll make Mom behave. No crying.
M	TYLER	Like that's possible.
M	TYLER	I know. But we have coasters.
F	ALLY	I don't do coasters till the third date.
F	ALLY	Is that you?
M	TYLER	That's Michael. My brother.
F	ALLY	He looks like you... or you look like him. Does he play around here?
M	TYLER	Not any more.
F	ALLY	Do you play?
M	TYLER	It depends who you ask.
F	ALLY	If I asked anybody?
M	TYLER	They'd say no. I try but it turns out you need talent. So what talents do you actually have?
M	TYLER	Falconry. I come from a long line of falconers.
F	ALLY	There's a lot of money in that.
M	TYLER	Well there is one thing...
F	ALLY	What's that?
M	TYLER	Our appetizer.
M	TYLER	It used to say "In Case Of Asteroid" but I took a shower and Aidan got high.
F	ALLY	So what kind of grade did you end up with from Vogelstein?
M	TYLER	I don't actually get grades.
M	TYLER	I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing.
F	ALLY	Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice.
M	TYLER	I like the books.
M	TYLER	You don't have to help me, you know.
F	ALLY	At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you when.
F	ALLY	This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right?
M	TYLER	You make it sound so cheap.
F	ALLY	It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times.
M	TYLER	I'm sorry. I didn't...
F	ALLY	You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job?
F	ALLY	This.
F	ALLY	No, that usually never happens. She calmly goes back to washing dishes.
M	TYLER	Apologize.
F	ALLY	Never. Your middle name is Keats? Your parents are pretentious as hell.
M	TYLER	Apologize.
F	ALLY	I'd rather eat monkeys.
M	TYLER	I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless.
F	ALLY	Victory at all costs.
M	TYLER	Now... I'm furious.
F	ALLY	You should quit anyway.
M	TYLER	Really? Why? Are cigarettes like bad for you or something?
F	ALLY	Is that a tattoo? Let me see.
M	TYLER	It's not really...
F	ALLY	Please. It's very bad ass. All that ritualistic scarring.
F	ALLY	I'm sorry... I didn't... I didn't realize.
M	TYLER	He killed himself.
M	Beat.	
F	ALLY	When?
M	TYLER	When he was 21. He had just started working for my father.
F	ALLY	I thought he was a musician.
M	TYLER	He was. But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy.
F	ALLY	Mine too.
F	AIDAN	Damn, you're not naked.
M	TYLER	You're not Irish.
F	AIDAN	T, What happened in the kitchen? It looks like somebody's water broke. Hi.
M	TYLER	Ally, Aidan... Aidan, Ally.
F	AIDAN	Don't feel bad that you're more attracted to me than you are to him it happens to all of them.
F	ALLY	Oh! You're the assaholic! Well, I-- Wait. What?
F	AIDAN	Alright, you two. Up. Dressed. Let's go. "Around The World" party on the third floor... a lot of ugly but a lot more alcohol. Let's go.
F	ALLY	I can't, I would, I'd love to, but I've gotta get home, my dad's waiting up.
F	AIDAN	Ally. Ally. Listen to me, young lady. One drink. From any country. I'll even put France on the table. One drink. Your choice. And we're gone.
F	ALLY	One drink?
M	TYLER	One drink?
F	AIDAN	One drink.
F	AIDAN	Hey, how we doin'?
F	AIDAN	What? What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry? You want me to say I"m sorry? You want me to apologize for showing a nice girl a good time? Is that it?
F	AIDAN	I'm sorry.
F	ALLY	Tyler...
F	ALLY	I, need, you... to call... my dad.
M	TYLER	Oh. OK. Sure.
M	TYLER	Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him...
M	TYLER	Ally? Ally?
M	SERGEANT CRAIG (O.S.)	I know Ally's a good kid, Leo.
F	CRAIG	...She was supposed to be back. She's not back ... call Ted Proferes ... and what's his face in the 9th...and call me back. Just do it, Leo! Beat.
F	ALLY	...oh God oh God oh God oh God...
F	ALLY	...I'm sorry. I fell asleep...
F	CRAIG	You turned your phone off.
F	ALLY	I forgot to charge it.
F	ALLY	That's mine. From my desk.
F	ALLY	How could you?
F	CRAIG	You were gone all night. I was trying to get some information.
F	ALLY	How could you go through my stuff like I'm a suspect?
F	CRAIG	Then stop acting like one.
F	ALLY	What is the matter with you, Dad? You have no respect for me and the way I'm feeling, my privacy. We talked about this! You're totally paranoid...
F	CRAIG	You watch your mouth!
F	ALLY	You don't do anything. You don't go anywhere except work. You have no life.
F	CRAIG	My life is right here! In this house. The same place as yours. But you're spitting all over it.
F	ALLY	Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a date!
F	CRAIG	I smell alcohol...
F	ALLY	So do I.
F	ALLY	Dad...
F	CRAIG	THIS IS MY HOUSE!
F	ALLY	YOU WANNA BURY ME IN IT?
F	CRAIG	Ally!
F	AIDAN	...So? She just left? No good bye?
F	AIDAN	Maybe she heard you play the guitar.
M	TYLER	You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat. You almost killed her.
F	AIDAN	There are sins of omission and sins of commission, my friend. I've dealt with mine and I've forgiven myself... you should do the same.
F	AIDAN	...little help, T... little help, little help, lotta help... TYLER?!
F	AIDAN	What the hell was that?
M	TYLER	Penance. I have to get to work.
F	ALLY	I didn't know where else to go.
F	AIDAN	How's she doin'?
M	TYLER	She's pretty shaken up.
M	TYLER	We've really got to fix that dead bolt.
F	AIDAN	My bad. Sorry.
M	TYLER	Don't be. You think she'll sleep?
F	AIDAN	You realize if she had had the S.L.U.T
F	AIDAN	Too soon?
M	TYLER	I told her she could stay here... Are you alright with that?
F	AIDAN	As long as she needs.
M	TYLER	You're up.
M	TYLER	Can I get you anything?
M	TYLER	I'll be out here if you need me.
F	JANINE	I can't believe you still come down here.
M	TYLER	It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk?
F	JANINE	Old habits. You're not writing anything bad about me, are you?
M	TYLER	Not today.
F	JANINE	I gotta run. Early meetings.
F	JANINE	I probably won't see you before Saturday so...happy birthday.
F	JANINE	I'll be sure to tell your father that you said hello.
M	AIDAN O/S	Bialy.
M	TYLER	Hey...
F	ALLY	Hey...
F	ALLY	Where did you go?
M	TYLER	Downtown.
F	ALLY	Why?
M	TYLER	There's a coffee shop. I brought you a Bialy.
F	ALLY	New York is full of coffee shops.
M	TYLER	This one was our place... Michael's and mine. We had breakfast there all the time ... Maybe not as many times as I think we did. But enough times. Anyway we ate there that morning. It was the last place I saw him.
F	ALLY	Oh. So you go there to write? To him?
M	TYLER	Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I guess I wanted to tell him about you.
F	ALLY	My mom was murdered eight years ago. The same year your brother died.
F	ALLY	You don't need to say anything, I know you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry, you know?
F	ALLY	It's just, I need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy. I don't want you to think that because I'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not...I don't know, it's just recently, he seems really...
F	ALLY	Wounded? Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something.
F	ALLY	I don't feel like that, though. I feel like I'm getting stronger and like I'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself.
F	CRAIG	Tell me something, Matthews, do you like paperwork?
M	MATTHEWS	No, sir.
F	CRAIG	Me neither. Nobody likes paperwork. But paperwork keeps our ship afloat. Paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags. But I can't do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing...
M	LEO	Jim...
F	CRAIG	...What?
M	LEO	Ally called Sharon.
F	CRAIG	What?
M	LEO	She said to tell you, she's with friends, and she's fine.
F	CRAIG	What friends?
M	LES	She didn't say.
F	CRAIG	That's all?
M	LEO	I'm sorry, Jim. Listen, why don't you come over this weekend? We'll get the grill going. Sharon wants to see you. We can have some people, nice people...You can circulate a little...
F	CRAIG	No.
M	LEO	Jim...
F	CRAIG	Leo, no. Stop. goes to answer it.
F	AIDAN	Hello?
F	DIANE	Aidan, it's Diane.
F	AIDAN	Oh, hey Diane.
F	AIDAN	T! It's your mom.
F	AIDAN	Hey Diane.
F	DIANE	You really have to fix that door. I'm so sorry to just show up. I called but your phone was busy.
F	AIDAN	No problem. Come on in.
M	TYLER	Hey mom.
F	DIANE	Hey. I'm so sorry honey. I tried to call but...
M	TYLER.	It's okay. Mom, this is Ally. Ally, this is my mom, Diane.
F	ALLY	Hi. Nice to meet you.
F	DIANE	Ally. It's lovely to met you. Just lovely.
M	TYLER	Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something?
F	DIANE	Yes. Aidan, would you bring back that spliff, please?
F	AIDAN	Uh..okay.
F	DIANE	Thank you.
F	AIDAN	How's work, Diane?
F	DIANE	Well ... I just found housing for a family that had been in shelters for three weeks. So that's good. On the other hand, I have six other families.
F	DIANE	But Tyler, I wanted to talk to you.
F	ALLY	Come on, Aidan.
F	AIDAN	What?
F	ALLY	Nice to meet you, Diane.
F	AIDAN	Don't freaking bogart that joint, Diane.
F	DIANE	Sorry.
F	DIANE	Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house. I wish you'd told me.
M	TYLER	I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers?
F	DIANE	Of course. Tyler, Your father is driving me crazy. I shouldn't even be discussing this with you. I can't get him to say he'll come to your sister's exhibit. Her art exhibit. He says he's in the middle of an IPO.
F	DIANE	Les says I shouldn't broker. I should let them be on whatever road they're on.
M	TYLER	I'll get him there.
F	DIANE	She cares about this, even though she's pretending she doesn't.
M	TYLER	I'll get him there, mom.
F	DIANE	You will?
M	TYLER	Yes.
F	DIANE	Thank you. Thank you.
F	DIANE	Why don't you bring that lovely girl to your birthday?
M	TYLER	Diane...
F	DIANE	Sorry. Sorry. I love you, darling, but this place reeks of marijuana.
F	ALLY	That was weird. I assume most moms don't smoke weed in front of their son's...um
F	AIDAN	Piece of ass?
F	ALLY	You know, you're a poet.
F	AIDAN	Hey. I know one thing. I know that in the time I've lived with Tyler, he has never introduced a girl ... woman...female...to his mom before.
F	ALLY	It's not like he had a choice. She ambushed us.
F	AIDAN	Yeah, but he would've shoved you in a closet or something. Or literally pretended you were a hallucination.
F	ALLY	Ha ha.
F	AIDAN	I mean it. It's the first time. Ever.
F	ALLY	Did it ever occur to you that that's kind of weird?
F	AIDAN	No.
F	JANINE	Charles, it's your son.
M	CHARLES	What?
F	JANINE	On the phone.
M	CHARLES	Okay.
M	CHARLES	Tyler, you're on speakerphone.
M	TYLER	It's about Caroline's show. Are you planning on attending?
M	CHARLES O/S	What? There are people here. You'll have to speak up.
M	TYLER	Caroline's show.
M	CHARLES O/S	What about it?
M	TYLER	You are coming, right?
M	CHARLES O/S	Fine. Yes. I'm coming. We'll go to dinner first. Alright?... Janine?
M	TYLER	Dinner? That's not...
M	CHARLES	I'll make a reservation and have Janine call you. She's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing.
F	CAROLINE	Make a wish.
F	CAROLINE	Retarded. Tyler?
M	TYLER/CAROLINE	"One, two. three. One, two, three"
F	ALLY	You're the second member of this family I've washed dishes with.
F	DIANE	He was doing it to impress you. He's never washed a dish in his life.
F	ALLY	Wow.
F	ALLY	May I?
F	ALLY	That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert.
F	ALLY	I can't believe he smokes in front of you.
F	CAROLINE	Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable.
F	ALLY	You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite.
F	CAROLINE	Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world.
F	ALLY	So... I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up.
F	CAROLINE	You wanna come?
F	ALLY	Was it that obvious? But only if you're OK with it. I don't want to impose and I'll completely understand if you don't want some random girl there.
F	CAROLINE	You're not random... you're Tyler's girlfriend.
F	ALLY	You like?
M	TYLER	Let's just skip dinner and I'll tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages.
F	ALLY	You just want to skip dinner. I got you a tie.
M	TYLER	I was going to make a joke about how I'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but I should probably shut up and say thank you.
F	ALLY	You're learning.
M	TYLER	Have you ever been here?
F	ALLY	Yeah. Every Tuesday with my pop.
M	TYLER	He's allowed to stand me up. But he's not allowed to stand you up. Or my sister.
M	TYLER	I'll have a whiskey.
M	CHARLES	Get me one too...
M	WAITER	Yes. For the lady?
F	ALLY	I'm fine, thank you.
M	TYLER	This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my father, Charles Roth.
M	CHARLES	A pleasure.
M	CHARLES	You're going to be a social worker?
F	ALLY	Yes. But with an area of focused responsibility. It's easier to find a job that way.
M	CHARLES	What will your area be?
F	ALLY	Criminal Justice.
M	CHARLES	Tough area.
F	ALLY	When I was little I wanted to play first base for the Mets. I don't think it's any harder than that.
M	CHARLES	The Mets, huh.
F	ALLY	I'm from Rockaway.
M	TYLER	Dad's a Yankee fan. It has something to do with the payroll.
M	CHARLES	It has to do with significant ball playing. You were a Yankees fan when you were little. You were Lou Piniella for Halloween.
M	TYLER	Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were.
M	CHARLES	Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me.
M	TYLER	It's a metaphor...
M	TYLER	Roger Clemens.
F	ALLY	Shane Spencer.
F	ALLY	Nick Johnson.
M	CHARLES	He's big boned!
M	CHARLES	How long has your dad been a cop?
F	ALLY	Twenty-two years.
M	CHARLES	Would you excuse me please... I'm so sorry.
F	ALLY	It's OK.
F	ALLY	It's just a call. He held out 'til dessert.
M	CHARLES	I'm sorry...And your mother?
F	ALLY	She passed away when I was eleven.
M	CHARLES	Ah.
F	ALLY	She was murdered. I was there.
F	ALLY	I never told you that part.
M	TYLER	Why are you saying this now?
F	ALLY	I don't know.
M	CHARLES	And, here you are.
F	ALLY	Yup. Here I am. Craig stands by the microwave as it counts down...4,3,2,1.
F	ALLY	I think he's lovely.
M	TYLER	God.
M	TYLER	Don't say it.
M	CHARLES	I have to go to the office.
M	TYLER	You have somewhere else to be, Dad.
M	CHARLES	The exhibit runs til nine. You guys take the car. I'll meet you.
M	TYLER	I don't believe you.
M	CHARLES	That's all there is, Tyler.
M	TYLER	It's not good enough.
M	CHARLES	I don't have to justify anything to you. Take the car. I'll get a cab. I'll meet you.
F	DIANE	I brought you every flavor.
F	CAROLINE	I'm ready to go home now.
M	TYLER	Ally...?
F	ALLY	Where are you going?
M	TYLER	I have something I've got to do.
F	ALLY	Now?
M	TYLER	Are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour? Do you need me here every minute, or what?
F	JANINE	Tyler? Tyler? You can't just...
M	CHARLES	It's fine Janine.
M	TYLER	She drew you a picture.
M	CHARLES	Put it on the table.
M	TYLER	You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her.
M	CHARLES	If I have any questions about what my daughter may believe, I'll let you know.
M	TYLER	Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life?
M	CHARLES	I've heard this song before, Tyler.
M	SUBORDINATE#1	We can come back...
M	CHARLES	It's fine, Khaleel.
M	CHARLES	Who is this display for?
M	TYLER	You, Mr. Roth.
M	CHARLES	She knows I will take care of her.
M	TYLER	And...?
M	SUBORDINATE#1	We really can come back another...
M	CHARLES	Sit the fuck down.
M	CHARLES	And that I love her. I love her. Good God, you toss that word around like currency. You have no idea what it means.
M	TYLER	Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it?
M	CHARLES	I have provided her world. And yours.
M	TYLER	That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do.
M	CHARLES	Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake. You have to take care of nothing. You are responsible for no one. You're a kid. You think you're the first one to lose anything? Do you think that there is anything you feel that I haven't already felt?
M	TYLER	You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch.
F	JANINE	Stop! Stop!
F	JANINE	Get out of here Tyler.
F	ALLY	Oh my God.
F	ALLY	Okay.
F	ALLY	It's okay.
M	ALLY O/S	Dad, it's me. I've been invited...I'm going away to the beach for Labor Day...They're nice people. If there's any problem I'll call. Or they will. Okay...Bye.
M	ALLY O/S	Dad, it's me...
M	LES	I genuinely have no idea...are you having a seizure?
F	CAROLINE	Time.
F	AIDAN	Berlin Alexanderplatz!
F	AIDAN	You people are culturally bankrupt.
M	TYLER	Whose was that anyway?
F	CAROLINE	Mine.
F	DIANE	Okay, you. Bed.
M	LES.	Me? Yeah, baby.
F	CAROLINE	Gross. Gross. Gross me out the door.
M	LES	You're just the prettiest girl.
F	AIDAN	Holy crap. What's with all the smiling?
F	CAROLINE	A child could do Berlin Alexanderplatz, you spaz.
M	LES	Hey!
F	DIANE	I want five minutes with my child before she ceases to be a child and decides I'm ruining her life.
F	DIANE	Aren't you a treasure.
F	AIDAN	I want a girlfriend.
M	TYLER	What?
F	AIDAN	Dinners out, movies. Regular sex. That could be all right. For like, a summer.
F	ALLY	You're such a romantic.
F	AIDAN	And I've had all the races.
F	ALLY	Excuse me?
F	AIDAN	I've had all the races. I've been with girls from every...race.
M	TYLER	That is the stupidest thing you've ever said, including that time with the bong in the emergency room.
F	ALLY	White girl.
F	AIDAN	Please. Like falling off a log. As a matter of fact...
F	ALLY	Shut up. Black girl.
F	AIDAN	But of course.
F	ALLY	Asian.
F	AIDAN	Twice.
F	ALLY	Latina.
F	AIDAN	Oui!
F	ALLY	A Latin girl actually slept with you? What's her name? She's out of the club.
F	ALLY	Eskimo.
M	TYLER/ALLY	No way!
F	AIDAN	Monica Ipellie. She works at the Public Library on 96th street.
F	ALLY	You slept with an Eskimo?
M	TYLER	You went to the library?
F	AIDAN	Inuit. In-u-it, Ally. Try not to show your ignorance.
F	ALLY	I don't believe you.
F	AIDAN	Fine. Nice girl. While we were doing it, I couldn't get this little, like, song out of my head...
F	AIDAN	"Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum..."
F	ALLY	Prove it. Ten bucks.
F	AIDAN	You wanna go to the library?
F	ALLY	The minute we get off this train.
F	AIDAN	Fine.
F	ALLY	Tyler, are you coming?
M	TYLER	I'll skip this particular bloodbath, thank you.
M	TYLER	bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum...
F	CRAIG	Where is she?
M	TYLER	What are you doing in my house?
F	CRAIG	Where's my daughter?
M	TYLER	She's not here now. She's at the library.
F	CRAIG	Does she know?
M	TYLER	No.
F	CRAIG	I didn't think so. I figured you'd probably leave that up to me when you're done with her.
M	TYLER	I'm not going anywhere.
F	CRAIG	That's true, Tyler Roth, son of Charles and Diane. Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased, suicide by hanging. You're kinda lost, aren't you? Taking a little vacation in coach before finding your way back to first class?
M	TYLER	I'm the one she came to when you used her face as a punching bag. She needs you. He is trying, before our eyes, to pull the shards of himself
F	CRAIG	Get a fucking dead bolt.
M	ALLY O/S	Tyler Keats Roth!
F	ALLY	He banged an Inuit! She's really nice. And smart. I don't get it.
F	ALLY	What's going on?
M	TYLER	Your dad was here.
F	ALLY	What?
M	TYLER	When I got home.
F	ALLY	I hate him!
M	TYLER	There's more.
M	TYLER	He knows me. Before I met you. He arrested me and Aidan. He gave me that gash over my eye.
F	ALLY	I don't understand.
M	TYLER	I mouthed off to him. He ... responded. Then Aidan saw you guys together at school.
M	TYLER	Aidan suggested...I...introduced myself to you.
M	TYLER	Ally...
F	ALLY	I'm going to be sick.
M	TYLER	Hey.
M	TYLER	Don't do that. What are you doing?
F	ALLY	Do you realize what you've done?
M	TYLER	Yeah.
F	ALLY	Did you think I would never find out? I mean, think about it. I had to find out eventually. You set it up that way.
M	TYLER	But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you,
F	ALLY	No. That's exactly what you meant to do.
F	AIDAN	Hey.
F	ALLY	Prick.
F	AIDAN	You had to tell her eventually...
F	AIDAN	Glass half full... you just saved yourself an awkward Thanksgiving.
F	AIDAN	She'll be back, T.
M	ALLY O/S	You know you're not supposed to use that on non-stick pans...
F	ALLY	It takes off the teflon.
F	ALLY	You should let it soak.
M	SERGEANT CRAIG	Okay.
F	ALLY	I'm going upstairs.
F	CAROLINE	Stop smiling. You look insane.
F	DIANE	I'm sorry, honey. I just... it's nice. Like an end of the summer send off.
F	DIANE	Have fun.
F	CAROLINE	Mom?
F	AIDAN	Hi.
F	AIDAN	Is this the, uh, that is, does, uh, Alicia Craig. Does she live here?
F	AIDAN	Oh great. I'm...
F	CRAIG	You think I don't remember you?
F	AIDAN	No, sir.
F	ALLY	Who is it Dad?
F	ALLY	It's OK...
F	ALLY	Really.
F	ALLY	What do you want?
F	AIDAN	Look, I'm a prick.
F	ALLY	And...
F	ALLY	Dad...
F	AIDAN	Tyler's not.
F	AIDAN	Wait. Shit. This isn't really my thing.
F	ALLY	He lied to me.
F	AIDAN	He's in love with you.
F	ALLY	He'd like to think he is.
F	AIDAN	I don't know what that means...I've seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you. She's a lot shorter and shares his DNA.
F	AIDAN	You don't have to forgive him today... just forgive him.
F	CRAIG	Thanks for stopping by.
F	DIANE	Are you telling me, Ms. Spencer, that you intend to let those girls stay in your school?...Of course they're all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap!...
M	LES	She's pretty traumatized. I wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone...
M	LES	There's no witnesses and it didn't happen on school property. The school won't do anything. They'll probably get away with it...
M	TYLER	She's asleep.
M	TYLER	Last one ever. I swear.
F	ALLY	I don't care.
M	TYLER	I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here.
M	TYLER	For what it's worth, I think you're amazing.
F	ALLY	It's not worth much. You made everything between us a lie.
M	TYLER	I'm sorry.
F	ALLY	Okay. Now what? I'm supposed to just forgive you?
M	CHARLES	How is she?
M	TYLER	She's sleeping.
M	CHARLES	How long do you think she'll sleep?
F	DIANE	I think she'll be out for a while. Would you like to wait?
M	CHARLES	Thank you. I can't. I'll call her later.
F	DIANE	I'll tell her.
M	TYLER	You okay?
M	MEAN GIRL	Have you done something different with your hair? I love it!
M	TEACHER	Okay, okay. Enough.
M	BAILIFF	You posted.
M	CHARLES	Destruction of private property and felony trespassing.
M	TYLER	I didn't call you.
M	CHARLES	I know you didn't.
M	Charles stops.	
M	CHARLES	I have unleashed a raging shitstorm of epic proportions on the board of trustees of that pissant school that will not abate until those girls seek enrollment elsewhere. I give them a week.
M	CHARLES	I know you think I'm a prick, but I have my uses.
M	CHARLES	Can you come by the office to talk to the lawyers?
M	CHARLES	Try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime.
M	TYLER	Thank you for bailing me out.
M	CHARLES	No problem.
F	ALLY	Using the little sister is dirty pool.
M	TYLER	Is it working?
F	ALLY	Maybe.
M	TYLER	Hey...Hey.
F	ALLY	Hmmm.
M	TYLER	I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office.
F	ALLY	Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast?
M	TYLER	Whichever tastes better a la mode.
F	ALLY	Say hi to your dad for me.
M	TYLER	If I said I love you... what would you say?
F	ALLY	I love you.
M	TYLER	I love you too.
F	AIDAN	French toast.
F	DIANE	Charles?
M	CHARLES	Good morning Diane.
F	DIANE	What are you doing here?
M	CHARLES	Tyler's coming by the office, but I thought I'd ride to school with Caroline first.
F	DIANE	Um...OK...sure...yeah...great. She's not ready though, she's going to need at least twenty minutes.
M	CHARLES	All right.
M	TYLER	Are you canceling all together or are you just running late?
M	CHARLES	Are you already on your way?
M	TYLER	I'm already here.
M	CHARLES	I'm taking Caroline to school.
M	TYLER	Take your time. I'll just wait in your office.
M	CHARLES	It may be a while.
M	TYLER	That's okay.
M	TYLER	Janine in?
M	THE RECEPTIONIST	She went for coffee.
M	TYLER	She getting me any? Just kidding.
F	JANINE	Good Morning, Mister Roth.
M	TYLER	Did you know about this?
F	JANINE	Who do you think scanned all the pictures?
F	JANINE	How old would he be?
M	TYLER	Twenty-nine last May.
F	JANINE	It's really been that long? I could've sworn it was...
M	TYLER	May 18, 1993.
F	JANINE	I should be able to remember that. I'm sorry.
M	TYLER	It's okay.
M	TEACHER	Caroline? Hello? Silence. Darkness. We wait in it.
M	TYLER V/O	Whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it because...
M	TYLER V/O	It's a good bet...
M	TYLER V/O	Nobody else will...
M	TYLER V/O	Michael...
M	TYLER V/O	Someone's been trying to tell me something.
M	TYLER V/O	Maybe it's you...
M	TYLER V/O	This girl! Ally! Her life, even the nightmare parts seeped into me and I swear to God I can hear you better.
M	TYLER V/O	What's that about? I've always been the worst listener.
M	TYLER V/O	Someone comes into your life...
M	MICHAEL ROTH	May 18, 1993
M	TYLER ROTH	September 11, 2001
M	TYLER V/O	And half of you says "Danger! Stay in your cave! You're nowhere near ready!"
M	TYLER V/O	And the other half -- and this is the part I think is you --
M	TYLER V/O	Says "Go get her! Immediately! Make her yours forever!"
M	TYLER V/O	I'm working on the forever part.
M	TYLER V/O	I'm going to have to step up my game. But I'm glad I listened.
M	TYLER V/O	I love you.
M	TYLER V/O	Don't be a stranger.
