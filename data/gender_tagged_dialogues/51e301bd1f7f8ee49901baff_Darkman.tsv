M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BANG!!	A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe. man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks. In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back.
M	BLACK	Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh... The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness.
M	BLACK	No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property... Does it matter? Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay... Another hard-looking man is approaching.
M	CONTINUED	
M	MAN	They're drivin' up. Black nods.
M	BLACK	Get their pieces. We got a surprise for those fuckers. We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln Continentals. The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.
M	3 SLOW TRACKING - ROBERT G. DURANT	is a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty. wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has been broken several times from his years in the Mexican boxing league. He was almost a contender. walks with a pronounced limp. is a large black man with a quiet, studied cool. is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows. wears a permanent psychotic smile. is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front teeth. 11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11 ready to kick some ass.
M	DOCK WORKER	Okay, against the car, ladies. You're c gonna stand for a search. 12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12
M	DOCK WORKER #2	Bunch a cuties.
M	DOCK WORKER #3	Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one. From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The visitors bare up in silence. As the visitors are led in, into the beams of the car headlights, escorted by the dock workers. The Dock Workers take up positions around Durant and his men. stands waiting for them. He eyes Skip, the limper.
M	BLACK	Bum leg?
M	SKIP	No leg. I was engaged to a girl with a wooden leg once. Skip brightens. Yeah? What happened?
M	BLACK	I hadda break it off. 15 The dock workers laugh. Black indulges his wens' laughter, then cuts
M	BLACK	okay, let's cut the crap here. Durant, I got just three things to say to you. One He holds up a chubby finger.
M	BLACK	I ain't selling my property. He flashes a second finger.
M	BLACK	Two. Nobody muscles Eddie Black Especially a bunch of fucks. He flashes a third finger.
M	PPY	Number three, if you guys is unha with that, which I can already is, then we can cutcha balls of f if that'll be more satisfactory. The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there
M	ROBERT G. DURANT	the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:
M	DURANT	Now let's consider my points, one by one...
M	GUZMAN	puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards Durant.
M	DURANT	One... He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer.
M	DURANT	.1 try not to let my anger get the better of me. SNIP! Black screams. As Durant goes for another finger:
M	DURANT	...Two: I don't always succeed. SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger:
M	DURANT	...Three: I've got seven more points. Looking down on the lonely waterfront building, we hear Black's screams. Making jerky little movements this way and that.
M	EYE'S POV: AN ENORMOUS NOSE	We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus again. The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern, every blemish a mountain.
M	EYE	Blinking.
M	NOSE	The nostrils flare slightly.
M	EYE	Looking.
M	NOSE	Still. Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as -- B- DEEEE -- we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its B-DEEEEE! B-DEEEE! We get rapid-fire left and right nose profiles.
M	22 WIDER	We are in a lab. DR. PEYTON WESTLAKE, an earnest scientist in his early thirties, is straightening up from thenfro eof o The nose belongs to YAKITITO YANAGITA a Japanese graduate' student wearing a lab smock and glasses with thick, coke
M	PEYTON	Now, if everything goes according to plan, in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every American... He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a computer. The nose is broken down into thousands of points. As each
M	PEYTON	We've finally got the Imager working how we want it. 24 We pan to the Holographic Imaging Cylinder. The glass 24 24P A three dimensional holographic image of Yakatito's nose 24P 25 Peyton glances from the Imager to the computer. He types 25

A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose. No more bunching. Looks perfect.
M	PEYTON	I don't know about perfect, but it looks like your nose. Down to the millimole... No, the bio-press won't be a problem. It's the synthetic

M	MAYBE EVEN	damaged skin tissue. make him better looking. Hey, what's the time?
M	YAKITITO	fumbles for the stopwatch that hangs around his neck.
M	YAKITITO	Ninety-eight minute and change.
M	PEYTON	Let's check in our friends.
M	PEYTON	moves to a microscope.
M	27P MICROSCOPE P.O.V.	Cells swimming in an agar-protoplasm bath.
M	29 A COMPUTER MONITOR	that is connected to the microscope. Amino acid content - 64.0% Membrane potential - 120 millivolts DNA content - 00.000047 millimoles Collagen congeners - 22.8% 29 Peyton punches in some data, and... 29 generated image of a protein molecule. Beneath it, the
M	EPIDERMIS	On the right half of the screen, another image forms. It
M	STRUCTURAL MATCH	The molecules rotate in synchronization. A loud beeping tone. Suddenly, the synthetic molecule begins to waver and spin randomly. Oh no...
M	31 VIEW THROUGH MICROSCOPE 31	The unstable cells fragment. Peyton shoves himself away from the microscope.
M	PEYTON	Fragmentation. Time? Yakitito checks his stopwatch.
M	YAKITITO	Ninety-nine minute. Again.
M	32 CONTINUED	He stares dumbly at the stopwatch, frozen. He repeats,
M	YAKITITO	..Ninety-nine minute. Cells always break up at a ninety-nine minute. He punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout.
M	PEYTON	Electrolytes, temp and glucose concentration. all normal.
M	YAKITITO	But still this ninety nine minute. Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.
M	PEYTON	Pacing, thinking;
M	PEYTON	Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment.
M	YAKITITO	posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets.
M	YAKITITO	We already try ten. He pokes at a section of lab sheets.
M	YAKITITO	And twenty. And twenty-two... We try all phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED
M	YAKITITO	But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs.
M	PEYTON	A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object ---
M	BAM!	He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech.
M	YAKITITO	Maybe I am lousy scientist.
M	MAYBEOI	listen to father, get in Anaheim! Get drunk on Sake nightly, forget I am failure!
M	PEYTON	Quick, Yakitito. A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to
M	YAKITITO	Catches the ball.
M	PEYTON	The most striking characteristic of thermionic emission.
M	YAKITITO	Throws the ball away.
M	KE	No, always you ask me question to ma me calm down! I no want to calm down!
M	PEYTON	catches the ball, dribbles and throws it back to Yakitito.
M	PEYTON	The answer, Yakitito.
M	YAXITITO	snags the ball angrily from the air. It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball.
M	PEYTON	Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.
M	YAKITITO	This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks.
M	YAKITITO	Amazing. It work every time. of aides. JULIE HASTINGS, a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them. She is dressed in a

M	STRACK JR.	How do you do? And please, call me Louis. This is my father who-- Strack Sr. interrupts his son's introduction.
M	STRACK SR.	I don't want some fancy-ass woman to do my negotiating. Where's Herb Gorson?

M	STRACK SR.	scowls, ungraciously accepting her. I'll stop worrying when you get Von Balibreaker's price down to sixty million... He turns and starts striding down the hallway, the others following.

F	JULIE	Then I guess we're only missing one element here.
M	KATZ	What's that?
F	JULIE	An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. Wine is poured around.
F	JULIE	.Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED
M	34 CONTINUED	Katz leans forward, listening.
F	JULIE	...Location. Location. And... location. Frankly, you have none of the above. Your fair price is fair for midtown commercial, not for riverfront.
M	KATZ	It's worth more to your client, given his plans for the area.
F	JULIE	if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact--
M	VON HOFFENSTEEN	--Business is business. Deals vill come and go, but ze velt vill pause for a beautiful voman...and a fine wine.
F	JULIE	Our offer stands at forty-eight.
M	VON HOFFENSTIEN	Smiles a worldly smile.
M	VON HOFFINSTIEN	Let us toast a zale at ze price of zixty millions. Strack Sr. smiles. He starts to raise his glass, preparing to toast.

M	STEWARD	Oui madame. '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is what I have serve. Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him.
F	JULIE	No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982. California Beaujolais.
M	YOU'RE	Pleasant, but hardly worth charging... Strack Sr., frowning, examines the wine. It's news to him.
M	STEWARD	Please, Madame! I serve the Reme!
M	STRACK SR.	Mine tastes okay.
M	KATZ	Ms. Hastings, please. The wine is fine. You're way out of your league here. I'm sure the wine steward-- plucks the CALIFORNIA The wine steward whispers sharply in French to the waiter, then turns back to the table.
M	STEWARD	Please forgive us. We bring the bel Reme.at once. Gratis. Julie addresses the baron.
F	JULIE	At any rate, our offer stands at forty-eight... As she rises:
F	JULIE	.And if we can't toast, we prefer not to drink. These gentlemen and I have other business to attend to, so if you'll excuse us... Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her, murmuring under his breath:
M	STRACK SR.	I told you to make this deal. Von Hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held
M	VON HOFFENSTEIN	Permit me, madame! Too fine a vine not to use for a toast!
M	STRACK JR.	How much did she pay you? Monsieur, I don't know what you are talking about!

M	YAKITITO	So, did you ask her?
M	PEYTON	Tonight. Out of habit, Peyton glances back to the microscope.
M	YAKITITO	This is unbelievable! You been saying tonight for weeks and still you don't ask her! Maybe I ask to marry you.
M	PEYTON	Your father would never approve of me. Yakitito stares at him in puzzlement. Then:

M	VOICE	Love. Science is perplexed over this great mystery. Shot of Peyton and Yakitito in white lab coats, identical Julie laughs.

F	JULIE	Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then:
F	JULIE	Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back.
F	JULIE	.They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she

F	JULIE	What's the matter?
M	PEYTON	I've been thinking. Maybe we should get married.
M	58 JULIE 58	Freezes half in and half out of the cab door. Panicked.

M	STRACK'S VOICE	Yes, go ahead, put a buy on the Kugerands... Thank you for your sympathy, Franz. He was a great man. And as long as Strack Industries flourishes my father lives on. The pull back shows Strack behind his power desk, talking nd Strack waves the person on into his lush corporatecoffice
M	STRACK	.Very good. Thank you. He hangs up.
M	STRACK	.Miss Hastings. Have a seat.
F	JULIE	Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Strack... I'm --sorry about your father. I heard last night.
M	STRACK	My father was a great man, and his
M	CAN GET	loss is felt by you something? allfof?us. Maison Reme 1967?
F	JULIE	No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been going over some documents and I came across something that puzzled me. It's a memo from your office to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious--it went out over your father's signature. It detailed
M	CERTAIN PAYMENTS--	Strack has gotten up to pace.
M	STRACK	Yes yes, I know the memo. Julie continues, hesitantly:
F	JULIE	...It seems like the payments... were-
M	STRACK	They were pay-offs. To the zoning commission. Bribes, to call a spade a spade. He gives her an appraising look.
M	STRACK	.Does that shock you? No. In fact I'd surmised as much.
M	STRACK	But it disappoints you.
F	JULIE	
M	STRACK	That's right, it's not your place. Yet I value your good opinion.
F	JULIE	Surely you don't expect me to endorse it.
M	STRACK	Course not. I'm sure my father never intended for you to know about it. I'm sorry if He's compromised you in any way. But I am asking you to understand. I'm not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond. But you know as well as I that
M	STRACK (CONT'D)	not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development.
M	STRACK	Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well... .the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law, but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises.
F	JULIE	All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings.
M	STRACK	Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here. What happens to the memorandum while it's in my custody is my responsibility. CONTINUED
M	67 CONTINUED(3)	Julie smiles.
F	JULIE	I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did--
M	STRACK	It isn't safe to have that document.
F	JULIE	Are you threatening me?
M	STRACK	moves closer, touching her arm.
M	STRACK	I'm trying to protect you. Does. his lips, wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you?
F	JULIE	He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs. And real-estate. Robert Durant is competitor for the river-front and knows about that document. He is a criminal, Julie. And he will freelyat resort to criminal methods to get he wants. There's a pause.
M	AND	Well, you're very eloquent, frankly I'm not certain what I should do. You'll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out.

M	RESIDENT	Ten years ago, pain from the burns would have been intolerable. The guy would have spent the rest of his screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz technique; quite simply, we sever his spino-thalamic nerve... 111 ZIIIP! He extends a telescoping steel pointer and to n's bandaged ear.

M	RESIDENT	Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men.

F	JULIE	-- Peyton! Where have you been? Why haven't you called? 334 Back to the monster face: Can I--can I see you? CLINK! The bullet is dislodged from the wound and drops Various close shots of screaming patrons on the Tilt-A centrifugal force, and their mouths stretched wide to scream.
M	MERRY-GO-ROUND HORSES	Various close shots of leering horses bobbing up and down. We are at a carnival.
M	PEYTON	laughing, his face restored, walking down the midway, one
F	JULIE	Put away that watch or I'll think you don't like me anymore. Oh, Peyton, let's spend the whole day together -- the whole week! A beat.
M	PEYTON	I've got to tell you, Julie... I've got to tell you something about -- about me -- how I've changed. Julie turns.
M	PEYTON	In the fire -- I -- I A voice offscreen rises above the general noise:
M	VOICE (OS)	See the mutant man, half man, half beast! Witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes! Peyton whirls around. soliciting pedestrians to a side-show.
F	JULIE	What? Never mind.
F	JULIE	What's going on, Peyton? What are you keeping from me?
M	335 CONT (2)	Peyton Ares at Julie. He can't bring himself to tell her. C'mon, I'm going to win you the biggest' fuzziest pinkiest animal doll on that rack. Something you'll-be truly embarrassed to own... and then I've got to run. They have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get tossed at bottle pyramids. Peyton lays down a dollar and is handed three balls.
F	JULIE	Why do you always have to run? Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He throws the first ball; misses. -
M	PEYTON	I. have my treatment... I'm not a hundred percent cured yet--but I soon will be. He throws the second ball; misses.
F	JULIE	Can I take you back to the burn center? Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly.
M	PEYTON	No! No, please. I don't want you to see me there. I don't want you to think of me as...an invalid or... some kind of f--ff-fff--FREAK! On that word he throws the last ball with great force. The pyramid explodes. Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect
M	PEYTON	...The pink elephant, please. The bored attendant, a cigarette dangling from his
M	ATTENDANT	Sorry buddy. It don't count if you ain't standing behind that line.
M	PEYTON	I was behind the line.
M	ATTENDANT	Not hardly. pulses.
M	PEYTON	I was standing right here. Next to my girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant, .if you please!
M	ATTENDANT	Na way. Julie tugs at his sleeve.
F	JULIE	Peyton, it doesn't matter. Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped words, between gasps for breath:
M	PEYTON	It matters. I won a pink elephant. For my girlfriend.
F	JULIE	Peyton... It's okay...
M	ATTENDANT	Get lost, buddy. People screaming on the Tilt-A-Whirl. Merry-Go-Round horses bobbing up and down. Calliope music gets louder and louder. Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:
M	PEYTON	The elephant... Quickly! The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's chest. We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits. From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice:
M	ATTENDANT	You heard me, weirdo. Get lost! The counter dissolves into a million fissures, as do the stuffed animals on the shelves above.
M	342 PEYTON'S FACE	Twitching violently, vein swollen to bursting. The camera
M	PEYTON	Screaming. A skin blister bubbles on his cheek. Against Peyton's chest. Peyton grabs them and--CRACK- The attendant screams. Peyton screams with him. Julie screams as well. 349 Peyton reaches for the attendant, lifts him into the air, hurls him into another pyramid, which collapses.
M	350 FUZZY PINK ELEPHANT	is yanked violently from the shelf. shoves it at Julie. In a voice hoarse with rage:
M	PEYTON	Take it! 352 Another skin blister opens.
F	JULIE	Peyton! No!
M	PEYTON	'Take it! 353 His face is starting to send off wisps of smoke.
F	JULIE	Please! 354 She is looking at him, frozen in horror. 355 His face is erupting into boils, which simmer and pop, 356 Peyton stares at her. Rage ebbs. His eyes become haunted. Hoarsely:
M	PEYTON	Forgive me! He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm. 357 Julie runs after him.
F	JULIE	Peyton!
M	DARXMAN	disappears around a corner, trailing thin wisps Of smoke.

M	362 DARKMAN'S EYES 362	roll toward the noise. He steps back into the shadows. padding, and wigs. The place looks like the wardrobe room of a major studio.
F	JULIE	Peyton?! 364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp. ripped to shreds, it's white stuffing all over the place. 366 He moves forward towards a darkened corner of 366 the lab. Peyton?! I need to talk to you. She halts at a site in front of her.

F	JULIE	Peyton. .? turns his head sharply. Only the upper right corner of his face falls into the light. The handsome, undamaged portion.
F	JULIE	Why didn't you tell me? If you loved me, why didn't you tell me? shamed, to be both coward and monster, clutches his bony hand to his skull.
F	JULIE	You had no right-- 377 Tears stream down Julie's face but she is too upset
F	JULIE	coward! 378 She angrily shoves the computer off the table. It crashes to the ground, sparking.
F	JULIE	Do you think it was the face I cared about?! Is that how little you think of me?! Why didn't you come to me? He is shaken by a silent sob. More of his face falls hideous bone. 380 Julie looks about the dark and desolate warehouse. charred Peyton/Julie photograph. Her face softens. She feels the Darkman's pain.
F	JULIE	I would have helped you. She stares into the shadows a long time without speaking.
F	JULIE	Don't you know I love you, Peyton? And no matter what--no matter what you've become I'll always love you?
M	381 CLOSE ON DARKMAN	his eyes expressing a ray of hope he didn't think possible until now. O.S. We hear the sound of
M	DAR KHAN	Julie... Julie. 382 But Juba is gone.
M	STRACK	Huhh??:!
M	VOICE	Julie Hasting's to see you, Mr. Strack.
M	383 CONTINU	Strack43 eyes dart nervously to the door. lb... Very well... He stands. A coin or two falls from his dimpled ass as he reaches down for his pants.
M	STRACK	Julie, how sweet of you to come before our appointed hour... but I expected-- you in something a little more formal. Didn't Ruth inform you that we have tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?
F	JULIE	I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.
M	STRACK	Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?
F	JULIE	Thank you, no.
M	STRACK	I'll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.
M	STRACK	...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and it's quite good--
F	JULIE	Louis, I can't see you anymore.
M	STRACK	Darling, settle down. Don't be rash. As you say, let's talk.
F	JULIE	You know about Peyton, the man I was
F	JULIE	Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was burned, horribly, horribly burned--I don't understand what happened but I know he needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy down.
M	STRACK	.Your news has a bittersweet flavor... Of course I'm very happy for you. If there's anything I can do-- the finest medical care can be at your disposal--burn therapy, recon- structive surgery. How badly was he... mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's sofa, her body wracked with sobs.
M	STRACK	... Where is he, Julie?
F	JULIE	He's living in an abandoned warehouse. He's alone... he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks it up.
M	STRACK	Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll take it in the other room. He looks up at Julie.
M	STRACK	I won't be a moment. He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the phone.
M	STRACK	Yes, Franz... And the closing price?...
F	JULIE	She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.
M	HER POV	Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk.
F	JULIE	Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.
M	STRACK (OS)	I feel sufficiently diversified... Franz, it is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy...
M	JULIE'S POV	A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the briefcase.
M	CLOSE ON THE PAPERS	A dark coffee stain.
M	BACK TO JULIE	As she pulls the papers from the briefcase. Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones!
M	STRACK'S VOICE	Yes. The Belasarious memorandum.
F	JULIE	whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her
M	STRACK	.I'm sorry you had to find that, dear. Our relationship didn't need this further strain.
F	JULIE	The fire... it wasn't an accident, it was you.
M	STRACK	Not me personally. I have an employee who does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn't like to pay taxes. And now you'll kill me. Strack_ spreads his arms.
M	STRACK	Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and you'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic. Julie. Consider the big picture.
M	STRACK	I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door. 388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then he hits a button on his desk-top intercom.
M	STRACK	Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at
M	ROBERT G. DURANT	enters the room.
M	I STRACK	Robert! I have good news and bad.
M	DURANT	Custom dictates that you render the bad news first.
M	STRACK	You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us.
M	DURANT	No problem at all. And the good news?
M	STRACK	Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor.
M	DURANT	Westlake? He's dead. I saw to it myself.
M	STRACK	He's alive. I don't like loose ends, Robert. Finish it.
M	DURANT	Okay. Where is he? Strack smiles.
M	STRACK	I believe we have a guide.
M	TRACKING WITH JULIE	as she crosses the street. The street is silent, desolate... Suddenly from out of nowhere, races toward her, about to run her over-- SCREECHES to a stop, only inches from her.
F	JULIE	turns to run.
M	ANOTHER LINCOLN CONTINENTAL	SCREECHES to a halt behind her, sandwiching her in.

M	GUZMAN	we're in.
M	DURANT' S ., VOICE	He just went down from the roof.
M	GUZMAN	Glances above to the darkened rafters ofathence one to warehouse. Then, signals for Smiley way. He will go another. They split up. The place is eerily still; we hear only an occasional computer beep.
M	GUZMAN	...Holy San Juan de fuckeen Capistrano!

M	DURANT	Guzman, come in! Smiley! Guzman! What the fuck is going on down there?! A burst of STATIC. Then:
M	DARKMAN' S VOICE	I am. Durant drops the walkee-talkee as if it were something hot. Take her down!
M	CONTINUED	The pilot lowers the throttle stick and 412A the chopper swoops down. as the helicopter descends on the roof of the warehouse.
M	DURANT	I want that son of a bitch eliminated! And I don't want his fingers, I want his fucking head!
M	SKIP AND CORKY	run out onto the roof, assault rifles in hand. They advance slowly across the room... not a sound in the darkness except their footsteps and the occasional beep of a computer... the air is tense with danger. Skip and Corky whirl around as iron shutters slam down over the windows and doors, sealing the lab into an
M	OPEN GAS VALVES	HISS, filling the room with the explosive mix of oxygen and acetylene. You're next.
M	DURANT	Where are you?! Pilot.and Durant look toward the entrance of the warehouse. The door is closed. Suddenly...
M	TO	WHOMPI--a bandaged hand slams into Durant's chest grab bim and start hauling him towards the door. The Darkman is dragging him out towards the roof. Durant mashes the Darkman's arm with the door: 416 The helicopter starts rising.
M	DARKMAN	is yanked from his feet.
M	THE HELICOPTER	climbs, lifting the Darkman clear of the rooftop. it bobs up. and down. The same toy that destroyed Peyton's lab. Durant's lighter lies on a platform just under the beak of the drinking bird. It bobs closer and closer to the switch on the lighter, about to make contact.
M	417A SKIP 417A	dives for it, snatching it... .the hand clenches empty air. The bird is a transparent holograph. Skip turns in horror. HIS POV--nearby is the real bird, bobbing in'synch with the holograph. dips closer to the electronic lighter's ignition button. Closer... closer... gropes desperately at the floor of the helicopter for a handhold. His fingertips barely touch a rope ladder.
M	419 DURANT 419	slides open the steel door and kicks viciously at his
M	420 THE HELICOPTER 420	rising straight up as the Darkman tumbles backwards in free fall, back towards the roof.

M	THE DEAN	is hurled through the window of an office on the 70th floor of a skyscraper.
M	A BOARD MEETING	The executives stare in shock at the Darkman standing on their table.
M	DARKMAN'S POV	The faces of the executives whirling in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel. 431 Suddenly, the faces start to recede... SMASH!...

M	436 THE HELICOPTER	swoops lower.

The legs part as they pass over a motorcycle, then close again. swoops lower, slamming the Darkman to the pavement. He in front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is grazed by the car's hood. His body bounces off the windshield. is lifted straight into the path of a fast-moving truck. run 80 miles an hour along the roof of the truck. Darkman manages to loop the bottom rung of the rope ladder to a steel hook on the truck's cab. Looking forward over Durant's and pilot's shoulders. The:pa3at has the stick. We are rushing directly town an overpass. The ladder snaps taut against the hook.

M	STRACK	We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears.
M	SECURITY OFFICER	Robert Durant, sir. Send him in. Goodbye, Governor. Everything's taken care of. He hangs up. We hear the door open and close. Strack's
M	ROBERT DURANT	enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised, severe limp.
M	STRACK	You look like hell, Robert.
M	DURANT	The son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter.
M	STRACK	And Westlake?
M	DURANT	'f ie man's a cockroach. You think you ;tall him, and he pops up someplace , Ise. A beat.
M	STRACK	g expect he'll pop up here soon. if Westlake calls, kindly refer him to Strack Towers. Come, Robert, let us kill the girl.
M	P44	P446 stars all around us.
M	STRACK	I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model.
M	DURANT	They do look up to me. The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.
M	STRACK	Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me...
M	P446 CONTIKUED	Strack gestures broadly with one arm.
M	STRACK	...It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour. Sure I resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty feet down. High steel... He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.
M	STRACK	You don't have any kids, Robert.
M	DURANT	What are you talking about?
M	STRACK	Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?
M	DUR ANT	I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!
M	STRACK	Then I'm going to make a mistake. There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil. Where's the girl? Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles back over his shoulder.
M	STRACK	You want to see the girl? Follow me, I'll take you to her... Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative steps.
M	STRACK	...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind.
M	STRACK	...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet... .as for my father, well, he was old, I spared him a few miserable years... Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake, but we don't all have what it takes to realize those dreams.
M	DURANT/DARKMAN	All I have are nightmares. A beat.
M	STRACK	Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you. Go to hell.
M	STRACK	Eventually, eventually... He proceeds nimbly along the beam.
M	STRACK	I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs.
M	STRACK	.See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better, whereas You..â¢ ah, here we are. whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically to an upright.
M	DURANT/DARKMAN	Julie! Strack laughs.
M	STRACK	Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! 448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat--
F	449 JULIE	gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses like csa y.. Strack"s tone is almost admiring:
M	STR.ACK	You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.
M	BLAM!	Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage.
M	THE WORLD	Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--
M	GIRDER	As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.
M	ON THE UPPER GIRDER	Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV-- Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.
F	JULIE	recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair. First my wife, then my father, and now He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push -It is the tragedy of my life that I always have to kill the ones I love. As he's about to push her:
M	A VOICE BEHIND HIM	IDuis ! Strack turns around. 4 5 0 STRACK St. stands behind him, glaring angrily.
M	STRACK JR.	Father? I should've snuffed you out at birth! With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for his gun. Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his

M	BAM! BAM! BAM!	Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto crawls toward them. 451 CONTI1rn D 451
M	A RIVET GUN	only a few inches from his grasp.
M	DARIOM	swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.
M	STRACR'S HAND	inching painfully toward the rivet gun.
M	DARKMAN	pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He steps back to give a final blow... .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.
M	STRACK	lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar. 452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist, then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam... Strack takes a step backward, exhausted.
M	STRACK	Now you get to watch your girl-friend die. He moves toward a terrified Julie.
M	DARXMAN	SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the
M	454 CRACK!	Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin into Darkman's eyeball to find-- Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the 456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456 lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold Krugerands. 457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457 Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears a funny little hat. 458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458 459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It 459 460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein 460

M	462 STRACK 462	with his back to him, doesn't have a chance to turn as:
M	DARKMAN	pounces. He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms Darkman hurls him up, up into the air. 463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463 464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464 her.
F	JULIE	Peyton, I can help.
M	DARKMAN	No one can help.
F	JULIE	I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.
M	DARKMAN	Take my hand. Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She
M	DARKMAN	It disgusts you.
F	JULIE	No. Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.
M	DARKMAN	This hand... it used to caress you. Now it can only tear, rip away at things. But you'll perfect the skin. You'll get rid of the scars.
M	DARKMAN	It's not just the scars. I've changed- He grips his skull.
M	DARKMAN	--inside. He pulls the elevator open. I can live with it now, but I don't think anyone else can.
F	JULIE	I want it back. The two of us--the way it was... Darkman's voice breaks: What we had--our life together--it belonged in the light of day. He disappears into the darkness.
F	JULIE	Peyton! Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:
M	DARKMAN	Peyton is gone... 466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466 side. Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic. The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she staring at their faces... It begins to snow.
F	JULIE	Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
M	AS WE ROLL END CREDITS	The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians, any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
M	467 A MUSCULAR HAND 467	snaps open a switch-blade. A second set of arms grabs the street person and spins him around, revealing--
M	THE CHARRED SKULL OF DARKMAN	Wild, half-mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets.
