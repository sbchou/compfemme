M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	GENERAL BRAT	When did it start?
M	SCIENTIST	At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
M	SCIENTIST	Private Miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. How do you feel?
M	PRIVATE MILLER	Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But... It's good. Good queer. Sir. Good queer, Sir.
M	PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D)	But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir, I should mention that I'm also feeling quite gay...so, a little queer, but mostly gay.
M	SCIENTIST	Private Miller. When you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?
M	PRIVATE MILLER	This went out...Sir.
M	SCIENTIST	We will send someone in. Now answer the question.
M	SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)	Private Miller? Answer the question. Oh...um...what was the question again?
M	SCIENTIST (O.S.)	What are your emotions towards your superiors?
M	PRIVATE MILLER	COUGH COUGH Fucking shit. Well, now that I think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. Does that make me their `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked up.
M	GENERAL BRAT	I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. This never happened.
M	PRIVATE MILLER	Hey! What the...what are you guys doing! Let go of me! Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
M	GENERAL	This is General Brat. We've reached a final conclusion on Item 9. Illegal.
M	TALK RADIO DJ	Well, let's look at the facts. Financially, coins are better because they're cheaper, and environmentally, forget-about-it, coins win hands down. For those just joining us, we're with caller Dale Denton discussing if America should lose the paper dollar bill.
M	DALE	Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants, clangs around. With all this unnecessary new security everywhere, we'll be setting off alarms left and right!
M	TALK RADIO DJ	We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but to the point. Next caller!
M	WOMAN	Um, I didn't order a pizza.
M	DALE	Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby Uh...yea-
M	DALE	Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up to your divorce proceedings 4 times under court order. You've been served.
M	WOMAN	Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real clever! Go fuck yourself!
M	TALK RADIO DJ 2	...forget about Area 51, Roswell sightings, Atlantis and the Boogie Man, let's talk about real threats, threats to our home and security... Fuckin' eh.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Nice! Hot Steppa!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	You think you know, chico/I know what Bo, don't know/touch them up and go - uh oh!/ Chi-chi-ching-chang!!!
M	SECRETARY	Can I help you?
M	DALE	Just here to check out some units.
M	WALTER (O.S.)	Come in.
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	Oh! Hey there. Are you here to fix the fax machines?
M	DALE	Nope.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	You owe American Express $4068 dollars. Sorry, but you've been served.
M	RADIO DJ 3	What gives you the right to say that?
M	DALE	Everything! They should be able to collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not? As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f- ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. And don't pretend you can't smell it. Ever been to New York? Great place, smells like piss, though. Twice a week, cough might fix that. Hold on one sec. I need Dr. Terrence, immediately.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Of course. One moment.
M	DR. TERRENCE	Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm-
M	DALE	Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property. And now, because of that, you've been served.
M	TALK RADIO DJ	...stay in your own country. Five simple words. And stay the hell out of mine! I'm not a racist, per se, but I'm not some hippy tree humper.
M	DALE	Let me through, damnit.
M	CORBER	My name's Corber.
M	DALE	You're Joshua Aaron Corber?
M	CORBER	Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't she? I was just telling her before I left how I've never been in a limo. Can you believe it? 35 and I've never been in a limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
M	DALE	Sorry, but you've been served.
M	CORBER	Ah fuck! Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK! Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and
M	DALE	Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
M	RADIO DJ	...3:09 in the PM and we-
F	ANGIE	Dale!
M	ANGIE (CONT'D)	Mmm. Minty.
M	ANGIE'S MALE FRIEND	Yo Dale. `sup. Hey Kyle. So, should we head back to my place and finish up the trilogy? Matrix: Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man or machine?
F	ANGIE	Of course. But can we just head to my locker first? I left some stuff by mistake.
M	DALE	Sure.
F	ANGIE	So, are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning to think I made you up.
M	DALE	Well, yeah, I really want to meet them. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me think.
F	ANGIE	You don't have to feel weird about it. They know how old you are and they're fine with it. They just want to meet you and see that you're a cool guy and that I'm not dating you just because you're older.
M	DALE	Of course. I know that. It's just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole bunch of cases that I can finish tomorrow. It's probably going to take me into the night.
F	ANGIE	Fuck. Well, then you have to just come over sometime this week or something, okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them. I will. I promise. I'm not trying to avoid this, for real, I've just been crazy busy.
M	TEACHER	Hello? Can I help you?
M	DALE	Pardon?
M	TEACHER	You can't just waltz in here and hit on the students. Get out now before I-
F	ANGIE	Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend.
M	MR. EDWARDS	This is your boyfriend? How old are you,
M	DALE	
M	MR. EDWARDS	And you're dating an 18 year old?
F	ANGIE	I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.
M	MR. EDWARDS	Alright, well this school is for students and faculty only. Friends can't just stop by.
M	DALE	Dude, you may be a teacher here, but we're about the same age, so don't get all high and mighty. It's not that weird. Frankly, it's natural. Well, in that case, get off school property or I'm calling the Police Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to you, but if this guy's dating someone your age, it's because nobody his age will date him.
M	HANDSOME STUDENT	Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama today.
M	DALE	I'll wait in the car.
F	ANGIE	So, do you want to get some food?
M	DALE	No...actually I can't. I have to go serve a guy.
F	ANGIE	Now?
M	DALE	Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang out later though. You can come over.
F	ANGIE	We'll see if Neo is truly the one.
M	SAUL (O.S.)	Yo? Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick up some shit?
M	DALE	What's up, Saul.
M	SAUL	What the fuck?!?
M	DALE	What?
M	SAUL	I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
M	DALE	Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. I-
M	SAUL	That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck.
M	DALE	I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry. I'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet.
M	SAUL	Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs.
M	DALE	Um...sure.
M	SAUL	Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
M	DALE	Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
M	SAUL	Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Smell it.
M	DALE	What is this? It's spectacular.
M	SAUL	It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter.
M	DALE	So...can I get a quarter?
M	SAUL	No doubt. Just let me grab my scale. A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits What's with the look? What?
M	DALE	Where's the scale?
M	SAUL	Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
M	SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)	You know what's weird? How sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know? Fucking scale. Shit. Where is it?
M	DALE	Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
M	SAUL	Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in the eighties.
M	DALE	You can actually smoke that contraption? You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint.
M	DALE	Well, be careful with that thing.
M	SAUL	Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	I can't even light it on my own.
M	DALE	Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what do I do?
M	SAUL	Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
M	DALE	Holy...
M	SAUL	It's...uh, it's good to cough. COUGH It twenty-five percent higher. And that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross-joint COUGH you're a good thirty to forty times higher. I don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You know what I mean? It's crazy. The better the weed, the more I wish I could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit I can think of in total, you know?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and I really gotta ask. What's with the suit?
M	DALE	I'm a process server.
M	SAUL	You`re a servant? Like, a butler.
M	DALE	No, process server.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	I'm hired to give people papers they don't want. It's pretty much the easiest job on earth.
M	SAUL	Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?
M	DALE	Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree two years ago, then I did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up. They both revel in the thought.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I smoked like five joints, gave out some pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger King-
M	SAUL	Hey man, did you get those new chicken fries?
M	DALE	Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot- boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend.
M	SAUL	Does she smoke pot?
M	DALE	A little. She's in high school.
M	SAUL	That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his biography.
M	DALE	No, no. She's 19.
M	SAUL	Oh. It's still cool I guess.
M	DALE	Yeah, it's awesome, although I think she's getting old enough where she's realizing I don't do much. And these high school guys these days. They're all roided out and going to Harvard. Even on my best days, I look like a fat, dumb piece of shit next to them.
M	SAUL	Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it pretty good. I wish I had a job that easy. Fuck.
M	DALE	Dude...you've got, like, the actual easiest job in the world.
M	SAUL	Hey! You're right, man. I never thought of it like that.
M	DALE	You can actually do whatever the hell you want. You get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night.
M	SAUL	That's totally true. Except tomorrow. Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't figure it out.
M	DALE	Sorry to hear that.
M	SAUL	Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after?
M	DALE	Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
M	SAUL	Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him!
M	DALE	I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot of Ted Joneses's out there.
M	SAUL	Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface. Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After
M	DALE	Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
M	SAUL	No worries dude, peace.
M	DALE	Oh shit on me. The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the
M	TED	Pineapple Express.
M	SAUL	Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Fucking hell.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	DALE (O.C.)	...me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! It's Dale! Let m--
M	SAUL	Denton? Dale Denton?
M	DALE (O.C.)	...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea- ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you can't handle it.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Dude, whoa. What the fuck are-
M	DALE	He fucking killed him, man!
M	SAUL	Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-
M	DALE	He killed him!
M	SAUL	Somebody killed somebody?!?
M	DALE	Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A lady, and a guy.
M	SAUL	Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
M	DALE	No! A guy!
M	SAUL	A cop killed a guy?
M	DALE	No! A cop and a guy killed another guy! The lady and the guy...No, a fucking woman, a police woman, and an old guy, shot a guy, a younger guy, in the fucking window at Ted's house!
M	SAUL	Was the guy Ted?
M	DALE	Which guy?
M	SAUL	I don't know, the old guy who shot the guy?
M	DALE	I don't fucking know. He was this big, old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he fucking took him, and he shot him! Right there in the fucking window! BAM!
M	SAUL	I heard Ted's got grey hair!
M	DALE	And they saw me! They saw me see them shoot the guy!
M	SAUL	What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did you come here? Did they follow you?!?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Did they follow you here!?!
M	DALE	No! I panicked. I was having a coughing fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car. Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at least. They knew someone was there.
M	SAUL	But they don't know it's you?
M	DALE	No. I don't think so. No.
M	SAUL	So...they're not coming here?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit. I'm not calling the cops - one of them was a cop. They could all be cops!
M	SAUL	Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
M	DALE	Yeah. I saw some blood.
M	SAUL	I wonder who the guy he shot was?
M	DALE	I don't know, who do drug dealers kill? It was probably another drug dealer. He was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.
M	SAUL	Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit. They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two in town. Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo, you want some of this?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	So, like, exactly what was the sequence of happenings?
M	DALE	I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me-
M	SAUL	Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.
M	DALE	When I threw it...out...the window...
M	SAUL	What? Dale continues staring at the joint.
M	DALE	This weed is actually that rare?
M	SAUL	Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
M	DALE	So, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed?
M	SAUL	Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
M	DALE	And am I the only guy you gave it to?
M	SAUL	Yeah. So, we're the only guys.
M	DALE	But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right?
M	SAUL	I could. Why?
M	DALE	We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go!
M	SAUL	No...seriously, why?
M	DALE	I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house!
M	SAUL	So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town.
M	DALE	No, listen - they could find the roach and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him."
M	SAUL	Mother of fuck!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Let's go!
M	DALE	Wait!
M	SAUL	Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here!
M	DALE	Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Are you sure you're not forgetting anything?
M	SAUL	Yes! Come on!
M	SAUL	Fuck! I forgot something! Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head-
M	DALE	We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Go back! Go back!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.
M	SAUL	Why?!?
M	DALE	We don't want to draw attention.
M	SAUL	Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
M	DALE	I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool.
M	DALE (CONT'D) SAUL	Oh my god!!! Ahhh!!!
M	SAUL	What the fuck was that?
M	DALE	That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm! Oh. Pardon.
M	MATHESON	Look.
M	BUDLOFSKY	Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I think he knew we were coming.
M	DALE	Okay, what do you know about Ted?
M	SAUL	What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Let's go to your place.
M	DALE	No way! What if they did see my license plate!?!
M	SAUL	Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn.
M	DALE	Well, how much money do we have? All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me.
M	DALE	That's it!?!
M	SAUL	Well, how much money do you have?
M	DALE	Uh...nine bucks.
M	SAUL	Well, shut up then! I've got more than you!
M	DALE	Fine. Forget the hotel.
M	SAUL	I wish we could just go nowhere.
M	DALE	Okay...where's nowhere?
M	DALE	So what do we know? Nothing. We may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. And, we could just be completely crazy. But, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were?
M	SAUL	He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but I mean- No, what I mean is, if Ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you?
M	SAUL	There's no way. He could only find out from Red.
M	DALE	Who is this Red guy?
M	SAUL	Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her.
M	DALE	But let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he?
M	SAUL	Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand job by now!
M	DALE	Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer.
M	SAUL	So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you don't trust me then?
M	DALE	Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.
M	SAUL	Thank you!
M	DALE	You're right. You are. I'm just being paranoid. Sorry, dude. Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We
M	RED (O.S.)	Ow! Hello?
M	SAUL	Yo, Red. You okay man?
M	RED (O.S.)	Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.
M	SAUL	Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the brass tacs, I need a favor.
M	RED (O.S.)	Sure man, anything. I'm Red.
M	SAUL	You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me.
M	RED (O.S.)	Sure man, no problem. Red swears it, hombre.
M	SAUL	So, can I come on over now?
M	DALE	No! We should do it tomorrow!
M	SAUL	I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's just go and get this shit over with.
M	DALE	Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. I want to think things through before I do anything. Let's go in the morning. Please. Saul looks around the dark forest.
M	SAUL	Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Red?
M	RED (O.S.)	-I can hear him talking to someone, so- Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the morning?
M	SAUL	Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
M	RED (O.S.)	Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow! Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is that the one on Granville and 41st.
M	SAUL	Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon.
M	RED (O.S.)	Well, cool brother. Noon it is.
M	SAUL	We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime.
M	RED (O.S.)	For sure. We should definitely hit up the casino.
M	SAUL	Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the house.
M	BUDLOFSKY	Why isn't he coming now? What did you say?
M	RED	I didn't say shit, man! There was another guy there and he said tomorrow!
M	MATHESON	Why did he mention the casino? The Asians run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?
M	RED	No, man!
M	MATHESON	This might be more than we thought.
M	BUDLOFSKY	Than you thought. I thought it would be more than you did. I'll call Ted.
M	SAUL	I always liked smoking weed in the forest.
M	DALE	I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some bull shit. Dale...wait!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know how this shit works, but...can cops... you said they might be cops...could they triangulate our phones or trace `em or some shit like that? I don't know. I feel like I've seen that.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace them when we're not even on them!
M	DALE	What the fuck is that?!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell is that?!
M	SAUL	It's them!!!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Holy fuck. That was close.
M	DALE	You know what? You're right. We should just get rid of them. We should just smash `em.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I can just take the batteries out? No! Smash it!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Shit!
M	DALE	What the fuck was that?!
M	SAUL	Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that tree!
M	DALE	What tree?
M	SAUL	That one.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free with the plan. It must've smashed when it landed.
M	DALE	Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why couldn't you have just smashed it on a rock like a normal person?
M	SAUL	I was trying to smash it! How often does a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.
M	DALE	Did you at least see where it landed?
M	SAUL	Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could call it!
M	DALE	With what? I just smashed my phone! Man, it's not like they got McGuyver workin' on the case. I bet they can't even triangulate it.
M	DALE	Well, then you shouldn't have said anything, cause now you've convinced me that they can!
M	SAUL	Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin'.
M	DALE	Do you see it?
M	SAUL	Dude, this is the scariest place I've ever been in my life. You ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed?
M	DALE	The "Blair Witch Project."
M	SAUL	No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.
M	DALE	Stop!
M	SAUL	What-
M	DALE	Sshh!
M	SAUL	What is-
M	DALE	Sshh! Can you hear that?
M	SAUL	What?
M	DALE	Just listen.
M	SAUL	I literally hear nothing. Wait...
M	DALE	SAUL!!!
M	SAUL(O.S.)	ARGHHH!!! ANGLE ON: DALE
M	DALE	Shit. AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
M	SAUL	Let me in! Let me in!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Let's go! Go!
M	DALE	Is there anyone even out there?!?
M	SAUL	I don't know!
M	DALE	If you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!?
M	SAUL	I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go!
M	DALE	No! We're not going anywhere!
M	SAUL	But there could be something out there!
M	DALE	There's nothing out there, that's why we're here. God, man, you scared the fucking shit out of me.
M	SAUL	Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm staying in the car.
M	RADIO DJ	-white accent walls would go nice with a dark colored room, say a burnt sienna, but don't forget...
M	SAUL	Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why don't we just shoot ourselves in the nuts?
M	DALE	Shut up, okay? It's my car.
M	SAUL	Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint before I go to sleep, and don't worry about it, even though you're being a dick, it's on the house.
M	DALE	Don't do me any fucking favors. I got my own.
M	SAUL	Thanks to me!
M	DALE	Shut up.
M	DALE	Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
M	SAUL	Fuck me.
M	DALE	What's the time?
M	SAUL	It's too early. It's...
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	This can't be right.
M	DALE	What does it say?
M	SAUL	It says, uh...
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	It couldn't be three in the morning, could it?
M	DALE	It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to be there at noon!
M	SAUL	Wait! My grandma's clocks! It's daylight savings! Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour! Dammit- It's four o'fucking clock?!
M	SAUL	-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And we've gotta call Red.
M	DALE	How?
M	SAUL	We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number was in my phone!
M	DALE	You remember where he lives, right?
M	SAUL	Yes, I remember. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm forgetful? That's right, I know the word insinuating.
M	DALE	Let's just get out of here.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	What the fuck? Come on.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	I think the battery's dead.
M	SAUL	Are you fucking serious?
M	DALE	It's dead.
M	SAUL	It's dead? Dale shoots Saul an angry look.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	What the fuck happened? How did this happen?
M	DALE	How? We fell asleep!
M	SAUL	Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put people to sleep.
M	DALE	We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
M	SAUL	For real?
M	DALE	Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave that thing alone.
M	SAUL	It's like, my thumb is my cock! - Bored and tired, they wait. Saul lights a joint. Dale
M	SAUL	Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
M	DALE	So, what's this guy like?
M	SAUL	I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
M	DALE	Well, do you think he'll be there?
M	SAUL	I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late. That's actually pretty late.
M	RED (O.S.)	Who is it?
M	SAUL	Red! It's Saul. Open up.
M	RED	Who's this guy?
M	DALE	Dale. Nice to meet you. Red ushers them in and shuts the door.
M	RED	Dale who?
M	DALE	I think it's better if you don't know my last-
M	SAUL	Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.
M	RED	What happened to your clothes? Where'd you call me from, man?
M	SAUL	We were in the forest laying low. Thinking.
M	DALE	Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
M	SAUL	Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?
M	RED	What? Oh, I uh... ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one before. I started crying.
M	SAUL	A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
M	RED	...uh, yeah, man.
M	SAUL	Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how many joints we've shared? I told you, man. This is from that time you ate the lollypop straight from the strippers sna- Saul. Ask him.
M	SAUL	Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-
M	RED	Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all about? That's what I want to know.
M	SAUL	Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for protest lawyers, and-
M	DALE	Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well, Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't think we should tell you any more than you need to know.
M	RED	Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I deserve to know.
M	SAUL	Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his house.
M	DALE	Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you into the shit we're in. It's just trouble.
M	SAUL	Don't be weird about this. If he wants trouble, it's his right to have it.
M	RED	Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
M	DALE	That's why we only need to clarify one thing - nobody's called about Saul or the pineapple express or anything like that?
M	RED	No one. Nada.
M	SAUL	Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine. We had a crazy night in the woods, which I assume we can both put behind us like grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant bong to get super-duper high.
M	RED	Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at home. I'm just going to use the ol' telephone-o.
M	RED (CONT'D)	What the fuck!
M	DALE	I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
M	SAUL	Dale! What the fuck are you doing?
M	DALE	We can't let him call anyone! He's acting weird!
M	RED	Fuck you man - this is my house!
M	DALE	I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-
M	SAUL	Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy! I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought this guy over here, he's a total lunatic. AAAHHH!
M	SAUL	Holy cock!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	WHY!?!?!
M	SAUL (O.S.)	Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked off that shit again!?! Ow! I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please don't fight!
M	SAUL	AAAHHHHHH!!! Why, man!?! Why!
M	RED	I'M SORRY!!!
M	DALE	He's going for the phone! Bathroom!
M	DALE	SAUL!!! Phone!!!
M	SAUL	What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is going on!?!
M	RED	I don't know!!! They're going to kill me!!!
M	SAUL	You didn't stub your toe, did you?
M	DALE	Now tell us-
M	RED	They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
M	SAUL	DALE! HELP! Red, you motherfucker.
M	DALE	It's happening! It's actually happening! He knows my name! Red knows my name!
M	SAUL	We should beat it out of his sellout brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck the Casino! Go alone!
M	DALE	This is fucked, what do we do now, he knows my name!?! He knows my name too!
M	DALE	Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
M	SAUL	We're not gonna have to kill him, are we? I don't think I could do that. Maybe we could talk him into killing himself, or, like, make him promise not to tell.
M	DALE	Well, we have to find out what he knows.
M	RED	I don't know anything...you broke my bong...
M	DALE	Tell us everything. Now!
M	SAUL	Don't look at me, you sellout bastard. Now start talking!
M	RED	I can't...I don't know anything.
M	SAUL	What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
M	DALE	I think we beat it out of him.
M	SAUL	For real?
M	DALE	Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't tell us everything, we're going to beat you up.
M	RED	Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red!
M	SAUL	You were Red. Now you're no one to me.
M	DALE	You've got five seconds, okay? Ready? Five, four- Dale raises his fist.
M	RED	Please don't.
M	DALE	Three, two...one!
M	RED	That didn't hurt.
M	SAUL	You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard, man. Like, fucking hit him!
M	RED	Wait! I...I...
M	RED (CONT'D)	No!
M	RED (CONT'D)	Ow! Fuck, man! Stop it. Listen...two...two guys came here, they...they were here when you called-
M	SAUL	Seriously?
M	DALE	Who were they?
M	RED	They work for Ted. Budlofsky and Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They were here all day, but you guys didn't show. They said they'd kill me if I didn't bring you to them, they said I'd- How many cops does he have in his...uh, payroll, or whatever?
M	RED	I know there's this lady cop. He could have more, I don't know. He's got pretty crazy connections. He's also got a cool- ass hideout. It's crazy man.
M	RED (CONT'D)	Listen, I-
M	DALE	Who's his competition?
M	RED	The Asians!
M	DALE	Asians? Which Asians? Indians are technically Asian.
M	RED	The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just calls them the Asians.
M	SAUL	What else?
M	RED	I swear to god that's all I know...I swear...
M	DALE	Alright. We should...tie him up and...and get the fuck out of here.
M	SAUL	I made a gravity bong here once. I know where his duct tape is. Come on, let's tape this piece of shit up.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	I can't find the edge.
M	DALE	What?
M	SAUL	I can't find the, oh...wait... Shit. They're actually here to kill him.
M	DALE	What do we do?
M	SAUL	I don't know.
M	DALE	Fuck. Oh, man.
M	RED	Guys, guys...listen to me-
M	RED (CONT'D)	I'm fuckin' sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I'm a son-of-a-bitch. I forgot bros before hoes, even though these guys aren't hoes. You know what I mean. But I can fix this.
M	RED (CONT'D)	I know these guys, it's cool. Just head out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell `em nothing. You can count on me!
M	SAUL	Thanks, Red.
M	RED	Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude named Dale Denton! They just ran out the back!
M	SAUL	In here!
M	DALE	No. I've got to get to a phone!
M	SAUL	We should hide!
M	DALE	But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name, then they'll go to my apartment and find out about Angie!
M	SAUL	I think we should stay!
M	DALE	Why?!
M	SAUL	Because I'm in the dumpster already! Shit! Fine!
M	BUDLOFSKY	They're long gone. Find out what he knows.
M	MATHESON	Red, you gonna tell us anything helpful?
M	RED	I just did, Matheson. Fuckin' Dale Denton's the other guys name. He was with Saul, they kicked my ass. What more do you want?
M	MATHESON	You hear that?
M	TED	Ask if either of them were Asian.
M	MATHESON	Hey. What skin color were these guys?
M	RED	What? Um...white, they're both white. I think Denton might be a Jew, but I couldn't really tell.
M	MATHESON	You hear that, Ted?
M	TED (O.S.)	Dale Denton. Not Asian. Alright. Kill Red.
M	RED	Oh fuck...you shot me, you motherfucker! Fuckin' Matheson...fuck you! You've eaten dinner here, man! Tacos! And now I'm gonna fuckin' die from this, probably. Get the fuck out of my house!
M	TED	Fuck.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Carol, there's another name to run. Dale Denton.
M	CAROL	Does he have something to do with our friend in there?
M	TED	If the Asians have the balls to send an assassin right into my home, we can't be too cautious. The boys say Denton and Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their assassin failed, they hired this outside guy Denton to finish the job. Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned "going to the casino."
M	CAROL	"Going to the casino"? I don't like that. I'll be back in an hour with everything there is on Dale Denton. He'll be dead by the time we make our pick-up tomorrow.
M	SAUL	But my parents live in Canada. You don't think they're going to go to Canada, do you? How would they get a Canadian phone book even?
M	DALE	All I know is Angie's new number is on my fridge and they could see that, so I have to get to her.
M	SAUL	My Grandma lives here. They wouldn't go after her, would they? She's got a different last name. Belogus.
M	ANSWERING MACHINE	" cough It's Dale. I'm probably at work, maybe we'll talk later. BEEP "
M	MATHESON	Budlofsky!
M	DALE	Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a minute.
M	SAUL	Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I want to go with you!
M	DALE	Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally be five minutes. Please.
M	SAUL	Fine. But hurry.
M	DALE	Angie!
F	ANGIE	It's Dale! You came.
F	SHANNON	Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and have some couscous. Can I get you a drink? What the hell happened to you?
F	ANGIE	Dale? What happened to you?
M	DALE	Nothing, I was in the woods and... ...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to finally meet you both...I apologize for my appearance. Robert, Charlotte-
F	SHANNON	Shannon.
M	DALE	Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both of you.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Very nice things.
F	ANGIE	You were in the woods?
M	DALE	Alright, now, here's what's happened - I've been thrust into a kind of, ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all just start to evacuate...
M	DALE (CONT'D)	...that'd be really, really good right now. I'll answer all your-
F	ANGIE	Is this a joke?
M	ROBERT	What is this Angie? I think it is a joke.
M	DALE	Listen. There are people after us and they could come here. I'll tell you anything you want, just please, let's go!
M	ROBERT	He's serious?
M	DALE	Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have to get the "F" out of here!
M	ROBERT	Get the hell out of my house.
M	DALE	Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I was working...this morning. The cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off, and I think they might have seen my license plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the woods, so...
M	SAUL	No fucking way.
F	ANGIE	Who are these people? Why are they-
M	DALE	I think their drug dealers.
F	ANGIE	Why?
M	DALE	Well, it's complicated. See, the...uh...it doesn't matter right now, we just have to get out of here.
F	ANGIE	Let's go to the police!
M	DALE	No, they are the police!
M	ROBERT	I'm getting my gun.
F	SHANNON	Robert! No!
M	ROBERT	We bought it for a reason!
M	SAUL	You... huff ...Angie? Dale! It's happening!
F	ANGIE	EEEHHHH!!!
M	SAUL	ARGGG!!!
F	ANGIE	Dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!
M	SAUL	No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S- Angie! Stop! It's Saul!
F	SHANNON	What did you do, Angie?!
M	SAUL	Ow!! Fuck. Now I'm gonna need a tetanus shot! They fuckin' kill. Fuck!
F	ANGIE	Saul? Dale, who is-
M	SAUL	Dale, they're coming!
M	BUDLOFSKY	Fuck! What the hell?
M	MATHESON	Get out your fucking gun!
M	BUDLOFSKY	What the fuck is going on?
M	DALE	Stop! Stop! He's with me!
M	SAUL	Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck!
F	ANGIE	Dad, put the gun down!
F	SHANNON	Robert, what's going on?
M	ROBERT	Just nobody move, okay? Except Shannon and Angie. So, you two don't move!
F	SHANNON	Oh my god.
M	DALE	Sir, please, he's my friend, he's helping me, he's-
M	SAUL	Stop shooting, man! I'm Dale's dealer
M	DALE	Guys! Please! We have to get out of here. Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson-
M	SAUL	It's Shannon.
M	DALE	I know! Look, we have to get out of here. I'm sure everything is going to be fine but better safe than...not.
F	SHANNON	Is this...for real-
M	DALE	Yes. Terribly real. MATHESON Ready?
M	BUDLOFSKY	No. One sec.
M	MATHESON	Hurry the fuck up.
M	BUDLOFSKY	Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't helping.
M	MATHESON	Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these people doing?
M	SAUL	Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed potatoes in my wound.
M	ROBERT	Baby! Get in the car quick. Angie, in the car! Dale - get in the car!
M	ROBERT	You stay the fuck away from my family! Shut up dad!
M	DALE	I...I think it would be best if I didn't go with you. I don't want to put you in any more danger.
F	ANGIE	What are you going to do? What should we do?
M	ROBERT	Angie, get in the car! Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake name. Something like... Car...lyle.
F	ANGIE	Carlyle? I...I have so many questions. I just...how can this be happening? Where...where are you going?
M	DALE	I have to stop this. I don't know how, but don't worry. I'll keep you safe. But still, watch your back. You never know where they might be, whoever they are.
M	DALE (CONT'D)	I love you.
F	ANGIE	Uh...thanks. Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you guys.
M	SAUL	Why aren't we in that car?
M	DALE	Let's run, man! Run!
M	SAUL	Huff Huff Where are we running?
M	DALE	Somewhere we can think.
M	CAROL	A fork?
M	TED	A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house. And the blood was fresh.
M	CAROL	Maybe he killed her, to protect himself.
M	TED	Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us. What the fuck is going on! Any luck with the cell phones?
M	CAROL	They smashed one and left the other one in the woods to distract us. Took us an hour to find it. And we found Denton's car, which was filled with all these strange disguises. These guys are for real.
M	TED	I want to talk to the Asians. Get me Cheung's number. Now.
M	CHEUNG	Hello?
M	TED	Cheung. It's Ted.
M	CHEUNG	Record this conversation.
M	CHEUNG (CONT'D)	Ted. This is surprising. What would you like?
M	TED	Cheung, I want you to call off your man Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout, assassin, and frankly I don't care. I just want him gone. I want him dead. If you do this, I'll consider it a peace offering, otherwise, you're asking for war. And just in case you forgot, I'm number one, and there's a reason for that. You've got 24 hours to reply. Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin failed to kill him, but it did rattle his confidence. It's earlier than planned, but we should strike now, while he is confused. Let it be known-
M	CHEUNG (CONT'D)	-Li-Youngs death will not be in vain.
M	SAUL	Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
M	DALE	"Tell us what you know!" How fuckin' balls was that?
M	SAUL	Like, really balls.
M	DALE	And I think I fought pretty well, don't you? You know, for my first time. We were like Tango and Cash, man.
M	SAUL	Or Scarface!
M	DALE	BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's hinges!
M	SAUL	And you probably saved Angie, which is fucking pimp. I probably couldn't have done it without you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp.
M	SAUL	We're in this together, right? So, ya know.
M	DALE	Thanks, man. You know, my last dealer was a total dick. You're by far the coolest dealer I've ever had.
M	SAUL	Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate that.
M	DALE	Yeah...like, the time before last time, I totally had weed. I just kind of wanted to chill with you.
M	SAUL	Really? That's awesome, man. That means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm always, like, "you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You know? And just so you know, I totally could have lit that cross-joint on my own. I'd just have to use candles, but, like, I've never smoked one of those with anyone before.
M	DALE	So, do you think we should leave town? We could just get on a bus and go, right?
M	SAUL	We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't think that could even pay for one ticket. What about your sack?
M	SAUL	Oh man. It's still fucking killing me.
M	DALE	No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell some?
M	SAUL	Of course. That's my bread and butter. We just have to go to a highschool. It's the easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is like, a block a way.
M	DALE	No way, man. I'm not going to sell to kids.
M	SAUL	Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere. I mean, we got it from guys like us.
M	DALE	Well, then not kids at that school.
M	SAUL	Well, there's a bunch of private ones nearby, but they're into way crazier shit than weed-
M	DALE	I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go?
M	SAUL	We could go to Crackhead Park.
M	DALE	What's that?
M	SAUL	It's a park. Really close, actually. Full of crackheads. They smoke weed too, though.
M	SAUL	Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some weed, or, like, what?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	See, that's the problem around here. Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle attention span. You gotta wow `em. Hey! Who wants some weed!?!
M	DALE	Fuck this place.
M	SAUL	Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic?
M	DALE	Man, this is great. Cough Cough What's it called again?
M	WALT	Pineapple express. They said it, like, eight times, you fucking `tard.
M	ACK	Oh, so sorry if I-
M	BLAKE	Come on, man. Puff, puff, pass.
M	SAUL	You know, I went here for a year. Kicked me out for having a swiss army knife. Everyone has a swiss army knife!
M	DALE	I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah.
M	DESMOND	My Bar Mitzvah sucked.
M	ACK	I touched Jessica Lubell's tit at your Bar Mitzvah.
M	DALE	You touched a tit when you were twelve?
M	WALT	Lubell? Are you joking? Those are the finest tats in the grade!
M	ACK	Fuck that, dude. Angie in 12th grade has, like, the sweetest tits ever.
M	DALE	Hey!
M	WALT	What? You know her?
M	DALE	Yeah. She's my girlfriend.
M	DESMOND	Whoa. You're that dude. You lucky fucker.
M	DALE	Yeah. She's pretty sweet.
M	SAUL	And we're all high, that's hilarious.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to teach you some business. Brass tacs - this is the best weed you've ever smoked, agreed?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	So I'm gonna make this simple. How much did you get between you?
M	BLAKE	A hundred and seventy eight.
M	SAUL	Alright. You gimme all your money, you can each take two handfuls of weed. That treat ya right?
M	DESMOND	That's fucking awesome!
M	SAUL	I know. Keep it on the down low.
M	ACK	Jason'll never believe this...until I show him all this weed!
M	SAUL	And we, my good man, are officially scott fuckin' free.
M	DALE	There are still people trying to kill us.
M	SAUL	But at least now we can afford to run. I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks. Let's have us a little mardi-gras fiesta.
M	POLICE LIAISON	Don't move!
M	POLICE LIAISON (CONT'D)	Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in your hand?
M	DALE.	I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid of it right away, I was just smoking this. I...I thought it was decriminalized. Or something. For medical purposes. I have epilepsy.
M	POLICE LIAISON	Selling pot to my students isn't "decriminalized." I'm the liaison officer for this school and I just caught four students showing off handfuls of marijuana to their friends. They told me they got it back here. Put your hands up.
M	DALE	Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I have is this little joint. You call this little?
M	DALE	I don't even have any money! How did I sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
M	POLICE LIAISON	It's possible you're telling the truth. I'm going to run a check and if it turns out you don't have any priors and all you've got is this small amount of marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine. Take a seat.
M	SAUL	They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck...
M	CAROL	Denton.
M	DALE	What is this for? What did that thing tell you? What did I do?
M	POLICE LIAISON	Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double, actually. You hit two parked cars two nights ago.
M	SAUL	The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
M	DALE	You don't understand! You have to let me go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please! This...this lady cop, and these guys Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for Ted Jones, and-
M	POLICE LIAISON	Ted Jones?
M	DALE	Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know what I'm talking about. He lives near Evergreen Heights. He- Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and a police office shoot someone?
M	DALE	Yeah. An Asian someone.
M	POLICE LIAISON	Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you down to the station.
M	DALE	Yes ma'am.
M	POLICE LIAISON	Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
M	DALE	NO! What are you doing!?! SAUL Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and Cash!
M	POLICE LIAISON	Freeze mister! Don't even...
M	DALE	No! She was going to help us!
M	SAUL	Oh...my balls...I seriously think I popped one...
M	DALE	IT'S HER! The lady cop!
M	SAUL	Then who's that?
M	SAUL (CONT'D) DALE	NOOOO!!! AAAAH!!!
M	SAUL	The slurpee! I can't see! Turn on the wipers!
M	SAUL	Dude, I seriously can't see!
M	DALE	Kick out the window! Isn't that what they do?
M	SAUL	I don't know. Okay.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Oh fuck! Shit!
M	DALE	Get it out of there!
M	SAUL	Ah! Ah! My leg!
M	DALE	She's following us! She's gaining on us!
M	SAUL	Her car's better!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole! Do something!
M	SAUL	Hold on. I've got an idea.
M	DALE	WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
M	SAUL	Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd keep going.
M	DALE	Turn on the sirens!
M	SAUL DALE	JESUS!!! SHIT!
M	SAUL	Run!
M	DALE	Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
M	SAUL	So... huff ... huff ...fuckin' sorry... huff ...forgot...
M	DALE	Don't touch me, you asshole! Okay, only one way to do this, hard and fast. Bend over.
M	DALE	Ow! Ow! Hurry!
M	SAUL	I am!
M	DALE	Which saw do you like most?
M	SAUL	The brown ones nice, but the metallic ones seems more...
M	DALE	Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be right back.
M	SAUL	A thank you would be nice!
M	DALE	Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room, please?
F	ANGIE	Dale?
M	DALE	Angie! Thank god you're okay!
F	ANGIE	I'm fine. How are you? Are you okay?
M	DALE	I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So, here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave town and contact a government official or something. From somewhere safe. I know this shit is all fucked up and I just can't apologize enough.
F	ANGIE	Dale. I've realized some problems and-
M	DALE	I know there's a problem! That's the thing, that's why I-
F	ANGIE	Dale, shut up and listen. People are trying to kill you, and me! Dale, drug dealers are trying to kill me, because of you! It's fucking over, man. Are you kidding me? For gods sake...
M	DALE	Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was thrown into this situation, I had no control, but I am dealing with it. This kind of thing happens, you know-
F	ANGIE	NO! IT DOESN"T! You're immature, Dale! I'm six years younger and I'm saying this! And the fact that you think you're some kind of fucking genius just makes it a hundred times more infuriating! What? You're telling me you think I'm a dumb guy?
F	ANGIE	You're not how you think you are Dale, and it's pathetic. Call me when I can go home.
M	SAUL	Alrghit, I'll see you soon. And I'm sorry again about the clocks. Ha! What a douche bag. Yeah, love you too.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta go see my grandma, okay? She was worried `cause I didn't show up to help with the locks. But before that I've got to smoke another bowl.
M	DALE	Are you joking? You're actually gonna smoke marijuana?
M	SAUL	Why not?
M	DALE	How can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through? That clearly happened because we were smoking marijuana.
M	SAUL	No. It happened because those fucking kids didn't keep that shit on the down low. Which is weird, `cause they really seemed like cool kids.
M	DALE	If you haven't noticed, we're not very functional when we're stoned, Saul.
M	SAUL	When I saved you with those Slurpees I was stoned. What do you gotta say to that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan! The Beatles were high!
M	DALE	You didn't save me! She was going to protect us, and now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Fine. Smoke marijuana. But you know how "Scarface" ends. Face down, dead, in your own fuckin' water fountain.
M	SAUL	For one thing, I'm done dealing pot. Mostly, because I don't know where I would get it now, but still. And "b", fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're exactly the same, and this whole thing's your fucking fault. You're the one who dropped the roach!
M	DALE	It's not my fault!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	It's marijuana's fault!
M	SAUL	Stop calling it marijuana!
M	DALE	Grow up, you fucking two year old.
M	SAUL	See! This is why you're a douche bag, Denton. Because you think you're better than others, but you're just a dumb pothead burnout, same as me.
M	DALE	Maybe I am a pothead burnout, but at least I'm not the dumbest most annoying guy in the world. The only reason I ever bought weed from you was because you're shit is so good, not because you're cool.
M	SAUL	But you said you bought when you already had a few times, just to hang out?
M	DALE	Bullshit! I just like...liked having lots of different kinds of weed at once.
M	SAUL	Here. Buy yourself a good last meal.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Super size it, bitch.
M	DALE	Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all that! Saul!
M	CAROL	Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was amazing.
M	TED	This is not good. We should have this under control. We haven't heard shit from the Asians. Got these lunatics after us. Shit. We should probably get to the farm.
M	ELDERLY WOMAN(O.S.)	Solly?
M	SAUL	Hey! Mrs. Mendelson! HOLY SHIT!!!
M	MATHESON	Eat it!
M	INJURED PERSON	OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!
M	MRS. CORBER	Solly Silver?!?
M	SAUL	Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me! AHH!!! FUCK!!!
M	SAUL	NOOO!!!
M	BUDLOFSKY	Yeah!
M	OLD WOMAN	Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye. Poor, poor Faye.
M	DALE	Hey, uh, what's going on here?
M	OLD MAN	It just happened.
M	DALE	What did?
M	OLD WOMAN	Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from right inside the building. We all saw it. They fought in the majong room and hurt the new nurse, Stefan.
M	DALE	Uh...thanks.
M	OLD MAN	If I was there, I would've kicked an ass. Dale looks, circle of people comforting a crying old
M	DALE	Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's going to be fine. ARRGGGHHH!!!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Fuck. I regret everything.
M	BUDLOFSKY	Get up.
M	SAUL	Oh fuck. That looks painful. EEEHH!!! Don't. Ted wants him.
M	MATHESON	Fine.
M	SAUL	El Dorado.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Dude, look at all this weed.
M	MATHESON	Shut the fuck up and keep moving.
M	SAUL	What the hell is that?
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Ow.
M	DALE	Hello? Anyone here? Red?
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Oh my god.
M	RED	What? Who the fuck!
M	RED (CONT'D)	Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya once, tool ya again!
M	DALE	I...what? I'm not here to fight, man, I-
M	RED	Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired.
M	RED (CONT'D)	I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right here-
M	RED (CONT'D)	I'm having a little going away party and I don't remember inviting you, cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to leave. In my dying moments, I don't want some asshole I barely know around.
M	DALE	Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy. You don't have to die.
M	RED	Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm gonna end up in But that doesn't matter `cause once Ted finds out, which he will, I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked through and through. Now if you'd be willing to give a dying man his wish, could ya run on into the other room and pop in disc two of Tu Pacs "All Eyez On Me". I want to listen to it while I die.
M	DALE	You don't have to die.
M	RED	Will you stop saying that, I've excepted it, man. I'm at peace. cough
M	DALE	Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail on him. I'm going to get him back.
M	RED	Fuckin eh, amigo.
M	RED (CONT'D)	Blaze of glory, motherfucker. This is awesome! We're so gonna show those motherfuckers. Think they can kill me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll.
M	DALE	What are you doing?
M	RED	So, this is the backside of the farm. If you stay low in the grass you should be fine. If someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes you harder to hit.
M	DALE	You're not coming to help?
M	RED	Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I was in shock before, but the air on the drive cleared my mind, I should get to the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs, right? I got shot in the best spot possible. I could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me. Full of possibilities. Go get `em, slugger.
M	DALE	But how do I get out of here if I rescue Saul?
M	RED	I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or just take it or whatever. Good luck, amigo!
M	DALE	I'll blow his fuckin' brains out if you don't-
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Oh my god.
M	THUG 2	What the fuck was that, Budlofsky?
M	BUDLOFSKY	Haven't you seen "Speed"? "Shoot the hostage".
M	THUG 2	In the leg, you fucking moron!
M	BUDLOFSKY	Still worked.
M	BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)	Throw him in with the other guy, and everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch outside. This is fucked up. Somethings going down.
M	THUG 3	I think he's got a gun.
M	BUDLOFSKY	What? You're kidding me, right? Die Hard?
M	DALE	I had to try.
M	THUG 3 (O.S.)	Hey! He's got another one taped to his stomach! And his leg!
M	SAUL	Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me out, you shitty bastard? That what happened?
M	DALE	No! I came here to save you!
M	SAUL	To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're caught, too. And now I have to die with some asshole.
M	DALE	Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked you. You're right, this whole things my fault, and they only way I can make it up to you is by rescuing you, and that's why I'm here. To save my friend.
M	SAUL	Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me and I'll consider forgiving you for this mad shit.
M	DALE	Good. `Cause I will. Oh really? What, you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick? We're not gonna escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners, and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!
M	DALE	We're not losers! We did that car chase. That was all you, man! You got away from the cops. I've watched, like, nine billion hours of worlds wildest police chases and I've never seen a guy get away. Not once! But you did it. You did the impossible.
M	MATHESON	We can hear you out there, and it's annoying. Shut the fuck up.
M	DALE	Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do it! This is it!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Hurry!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Yes! Yes! You know what this is called, Saul? This is called saving you.
M	TED	You have them?
M	BUDLOFSKY	Got them downstairs.
M	CAROL	Where did you find them?
M	BUDLOFSKY	We found Saul at his grandmother's and Dale Denton busted in here like a madman, armed to the teeth, and-
M	BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)	Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I disarmed him. We got `em both holed up downstairs.
M	TED	He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank.
M	CAROL	Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?
M	TED	Well, we'll torture these two bastards and find out everything they know. What about the shipment? Ready to move out?
M	BUDLOFSKY	We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so.
M	DALE	This isn't working. Turn around. I'm using my mouth.
M	SAUL	Someone's coming!
M	DALE	Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a move, if I cough twice, you take the lead. Got it?
M	SAUL	What? No! What if you actually cough?
M	MATHESON	Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it, okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut it- AAAHHHHH!!!
M	SAUL	Holy shit, man! I'm sorry!
M	MATHESON	AAAHHHHH!!! ARGH!!! YOU SHOT ME! I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOT! HELP! HELP! AAAAAHHHHH!!!
M	TED	Has anyone seen my bigger knife? Do you guys hear that?
M	BUDLOFSKY	Arg...
M	TED	BUDLOFSKY!!!
M	ASIAN ASSASSIN 1	WAR IS UPON YOU!!!
M	SAUL	Dale? You're alive!
M	DALE	What happened?
M	SAUL	They got your ear.
M	DALE	My what?
M	SAUL	Here. Get up.
M	DALE	AAHHHH!!! MY EAR!!! YOU KILLED MY EAR!!!
M	MATHESON	You shot me..
M	SAUL	Well, you kneed my balls!
M	DALE	You shot him?
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Whoa. Uh...stay there.
M	CAROL	On three.
M	CAROL (CONT'D)	One, two, three!
M	CAROL (CONT'D)	You go down. I'll take care of this.
M	CAROL (CONT'D)	ARGGG!!!
M	SAUL	Look at all this fucking weed, man. Where the hell are we? Is this some underground weed city we don't know about? Saul suddenly GRABS Dale and pulls him down.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	What's that noise?
M	DALE	I don't know! That guy just blew half my fucking ear off!
M	SAUL	There's some dudes in here. I saw them when I got dragged down. And there's some kind of super-suit or something.
M	DALE	Were they armed?
M	SAUL	I don't think so.
M	DALE	I can't hear them.
M	SAUL	You could boost me up! We'll sneak out.
M	DALE	Shoot back!
M	SAUL	Really?
M	DALE	YES!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Now run! They run and turn several corners when Saul suddenly
M	SAUL DALE	
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Nice. You got him.
M	THUG 7	Lance? Holy fuck! You sons-of-
M	DALE	Holy shit. I killed him.
M	SAUL	About time you killed somebody. You're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and I`ve killed two bad guys already.
M	DALE	You'll never be able to pull me up, but I'll boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man.
M	SAUL	What? No fucking way, Dale. What about you?
M	DALE	Don't worry about me.
M	SAUL	Whoa. That was awesome.
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	You're a good man, Dale Denton. Saul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the
M	DALE	Hold on!
M	SAUL	Wha-
M	TED	Denton!!!
M	SAUL	AHHH!!!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy.
M	SAUL	
M	DALE	Oh god.
M	TED	Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch?
M	DALE	Ha!
M	SAUL	Fuck tha po-lice.
M	CAROL	I'm a fucking cop, you moron.
M	SAUL	AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHH!!!
M	DALE	You can't fucking take me. I'm young. Virile. Prime of my life. You're old. Old and dying.
M	TED	I don't know who you are, Denton, or why you're trying to ruin my life, but you're fuckin' dead! AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
M	SAUL	Crazy huff huff , psycho bitch...
M	MATHESON (O.S.)	Hey Saul!
M	MATHESON (CONT'D)	I owe you one. In the gut. Then the balls, and then the-
M	RED	You just got killed by a Ford Fiesta motherfucker!!! How you like me now!?!
M	SAUL	R...Red?
M	RED	Saul! `sup! Dude, me and that Dale guy are rescuing you. And getting revenge on those whose shot us in the gut.
M	SAUL	RED!!!
M	SAUL (CONT'D)	Oh no... Oh yeah!
M	CAROL	Now prepare to eat shit and die-
M	DALE	Sorry, Ted...
M	DALE (CONT'D)	...but you've been served.
M	DALE	Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Aaaahhhh!!!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Ow. Ah. Ow. Okay... cough cough
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Saul!
M	DALE (CONT'D)	Saul! Cough Cough You're okay!
M	SAUL	Cough Cough What the fuck happened?
M	DALE	We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them. We won. SAUL No fucking way. Seriously? How did that happen?
M	DALE	I have absolutely no idea.
M	SAUL	They were fighting Asian dudes, man.
M	DALE	Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted kill.
M	SAUL	So we're, like, in a drug war. That's cool.
M	DALE	What's cool is that you came back for me man. You did, right? You weren't just captured again, were you?
M	SAUL	Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the hell was I going to leave you there after you came to save me? Fuck that.
M	RED	Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Light me on
M	DALE	Red? You okay?
M	RED	Fuck yeah, I'm fine. I'm Red. You're makin' me feel like a broken record. Now can we get the fuck out of this shit hole. What should we do now? Can we go home?
M	DALE	I've gotta get downtown, try and win Angie back.
M	SAUL	Tell her you cut off your ear for her, like that crazy artist. But, seriously dude, your joking right? She'll never take you back, ever. Just grow up and date a woman your own age.
M	DALE	Do you think we should have looked for the ear? They probably could've re- attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing kind of fucking sucks.
M	RED	Oh my god, they blew your ear off, man! Fuck that's gross. Can you dudes switch sides? I don't want to look at it.
M	SAUL	Don't worry, man. Look at Evander Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. And you only need half of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch.
M	DALE	I just realized I've 100% lost my job by now. I haven't called in for days.
M	SAUL	Who fuckin' cares? I thought you wanted to be a talk radio dude anyways? And, like, I never said anything, but you do have the voice. Like, when I didn't know what you did, I kind of thought you might have been doing cartoon voices, you know, like that Shrek shit, and that's why you wore a suit.
M	RED	You do have a good talk radio voice. I love that shit, too. I...wait, say something again? What? Why?
M	RED	You're that dude whose always calling KSTAR about havin' two garbage days. I totally agree with you, man. I work out of my house, and it's, like, one of my main concerns, garbage pile up.
M	DALE	Saul, what're you going to do?
M	SAUL	Work at a bong shop.
M	RED	I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys.
M	SAUL	Do you hear something?
M	DALE	All I hear is ringing.
M	SAUL	Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I don't know...like, there might be someone out there. I mean...how do we know we got them all?
M	RED	What the fuck are you guys talkin' about? I don't hear shit.
M	DALE	Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of fire, and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just, you know- ...a little paranoia.
M	SAUL	Stop!
M	RED	Are you guys fuckin' with me?
M	DALE	What-
M	SAUL RED	
M	DALE (CONT'D)	What is-
M	SAUL	Sshh! Can you hear that?
M	DALE	What?
M	RED	Oh fuck. I'm freakin' out.
M	SAUL	Just listen.
M	DALE	I literally only hear ringing.
M	RED	Fuck this noise! Red pushes himself off Dale and Saul and run into the
M	DALE	I'm following him.
M	SAUL	Wait! Me too!
