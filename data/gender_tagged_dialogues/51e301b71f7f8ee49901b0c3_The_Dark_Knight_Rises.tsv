M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	GORDON (V.O)	Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for. He was...a hero. Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining...
F	GORDON	But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK. The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
M	CIA MAN	Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
M	DRIVER	He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
M	CIA MAN	You don't get to bring friends. They are not my friends.
M	DRIVER	Don't worry, no charge for them.
M	CIA MAN	Why would I want them?
M	DRIVER	They were trying to grab your prize. (Smiles.) They work for the mercenary. The masked man. Bane? The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.
M	CIA MAN	Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.
M	CIA MAN	What are you doing in the middle of my operation? the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you. CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane.
M	CIA MAN	Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you?
M	THIRD PRISONER	We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask...
M	BANE	Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan. If I pull this off, will you die?
M	BANE	It would be extremely painful.
M	CIA MAN	You're a big guy -
M	BANE	For you. CIA MAN Was being caught part of your plan?
M	BANE	Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us.
M	DR. PAVEL	Nothing! I said nothing!
M	CIA MAN	Why not just ask him?
M	BANE	He would not have told us.
M	CIA MAN	You have methods.
M	BANE	Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem. CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
M	SERGEANT	Sir?
M	CIA MAN	Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught. What's the next step of your master plan? Crashing this plane... With no survivors. A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
M	BANE	Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage. The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.
M	HOODED MAN 2	Have we started the fire? The fire rises. Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
M	BANE	Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for fear... Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
M	BANE	That comes later. Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
M	MAYOR (V.O.)	Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday... ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...
M	MAYOR (V.O.)	But we're here tonight because it's one of the most important... ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side... Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime and, yes, ultimately, his sacrifice, have made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago... ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
M	MAYOR	This city has seen a historic turnaround. No city is without crime. But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act. And to them I say...not on my watch. Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up. I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event. I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit...
M	MAYOR (O.S)	Now I'm going to give way to an important voice...
M	CONGRESSMAN	Commissioner.
F	GORDON	Congressman.
M	CONGRESSMAN	Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
M	FOLEY	No one has. Not in years.
M	MAYOR (O.S)	He can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. A thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man - (Turns to picture of Dent.) And murdered him in cold blood. The Congressman watches a tray of canap√©s breeze past, then
M	CONGRESSMAN	Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.
M	MAID	Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
M	MAYOR (O.S)	Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent...
M	CONGRESSMAN	Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? We're gonna be here all night.
F	GORDON	Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman. But I'll let him tell you himself - Commissioner Gordon? Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
F	GORDON	The truth...? I have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent... Gordon folds up his speech. Maybe the time isn't right... Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
M	CONGRESSMAN	Thank Christ for that... know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
F	GORDON	The second shift reports in?
M	FOLEY	On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor -
F	GORDON	That's your department.
M	CONGRESSMAN	Anyone shown him the crime stats?
M	FOLEY	He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers.
M	CONGRESSMAN	Must be popular with the wife.
M	FOLEY	Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland.
M	CONGRESSMAN	He'll have plenty of time for visits. Mayor's dumping him in the spring.
M	FOLEY	Really? He's a hero.
M	CONGRESSMAN	War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the job's yours.
M	MAID 2	They say he never leaves the East Wing.
M	MAID 3	I heard he had an accident - that he's disfigured.
M	ALFRED	Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs? Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
M	ALFRED	Where's Mrs. Bolton?
M	MAID	She's up at the bar, sir. Can I help?
M	ALFRED	The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more.
M	ALFRED	I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you.
F	MIRANDA	It's important, Mr. Pennyworth. Her accent is European. Hard to place.
M	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	Don't take it personally, Miranda.
M	DAGGETT	Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good of you to let me on the grounds.
M	ALFRED	The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.
M	DAGGETT	Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project? He can't help you get your money back. But I can.
F	MIRANDA	I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed?
M	MAID	I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
M	MAID	Although you don't have the long nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial scars... She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.
M	WAYNE	Is that what they say about me?
M	MAID	It's just that...nobody sees you...
M	WAYNE	That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable.
M	MAID	Oops. No one told me it was uncrackable.
M	WAYNE	I'm afraid I can't let you take those.
M	MAID	Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple. She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down. have to be made. She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
M	MAID	Can I have a ride? The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.
M	CONGRESSMAN	You read my mind.
M	ALFRED	Miss Tate was asking to see you again.
M	WAYNE	She's very persistent.
M	ALFRED	And quite lovely, in case you were wondering.
M	WAYNE	I wasn't.
M	ALFRED	What are you doing?
M	WAYNE	Examining print dust. We've been robbed.
M	ALFRED	And this is your idea of raising the alarm? She took the pearls. Tracking device and all.
M	ALFRED	She?
M	WAYNE	One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house. Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints?
M	WAYNE	I'm not. She was.
M	YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)	Sir?
M	BLAKE	I didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you.
F	GORDON	What's the problem, son?
M	BLAKE	Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling. He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event.
F	GORDON	That's a job for the police?
M	BLAKE	Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good. Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.
M	BLAKE	But here you are. Like we're still at war...
F	GORDON	Old habits.
M	BLAKE	Or instinct.
F	GORDON	What's your name, son?
M	BLAKE	Blake, sir.
F	GORDON	You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake?
M	BLAKE	It's that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.
F	GORDON	What about it?
M	BLAKE	The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck...then just vanishes?
F	GORDON	I'm not hearing a question, son.
M	BLAKE	Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
F	GORDON	I know exactly who he was. (Turns to Blake.) He was Batman.
M	GORDON (O.S.)	Let's go see about the Congressman's wife...
M	ALFRED	Master Wayne? Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.
M	ALFRED	You haven't been down here in a long time...
M	WAYNE	Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery - but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. She's good.
M	ALFRED	She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace.
M	WAYNE	We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E's... of close calls, tips from fences...
M	WAYNE	She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.
M	ALFRED	We should send the police before she fences the pearls.
M	WAYNE	She won't. She likes them too much. And they weren't what she was after.
M	ALFRED	What was she after?
M	WAYNE	My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable.
M	ALFRED	Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee.
M	WAYNE	Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?
M	ALFRED	At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world.
M	WAYNE	There's nothing out there for me.
M	ALFRED	And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone - I did find someone, Alfred.
M	ALFRED	I know. And then you lost them. That's part of living, sir. But you're not living - you're waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn't come back. Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding. Every year I took my holiday. I'd go to Florence. There's a caf√© by the Arno... Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca... that one day I'd look across the tables, and see you. Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, or me to you, but we'd both know...that you'd made it. That you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and I wanted more for you than that. I still do. Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.
M	DWP MAN	They wash up a couple times a month. More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels. We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him... They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
M	ROSS	What?
M	BLAKE	Name's Jimmy. He's at St. Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys home where I...I coach some ball.
M	FATHER REILLY	Jimmy hadn't been here for months.
M	BLAKE	Why?
M	FATHER REILLY	You know why, Blake - he aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen -
M	BLAKE	The Wayne Foundation gives money for that -
M	FATHER REILLY	Not for two years now.
M	BLAKE	He has a brother here, right?
M	FATHER REILLY	Mark. I'll tell him.
M	BLAKE	I'd like to, if that's okay.
M	BLAKE	I'm sorry.
M	BLAKE	What was he doing in the tunnels?
M	MARK	Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out. Say you can live down there. Say there's work down there.
M	BLAKE	What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?
M	MARK	More than you can find up here, I guess. Blake considers this. Troubled.
M	STRYVER	You brought a date?
F	SELINA	I like having someone around to open doors for me.
F	SELINA	Right hand. No partials. Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
M	STRYVER	Very nice. He pockets the envelope.
F	SELINA	Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me?
M	STRYVER	Oh, yes.
F	SELINA	I don't know what you're going to do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb. As Stryver checks the envelope again -
F	SELINA	You don't count so good, huh?
M	STRYVER	I count fine. The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.
M	STRYVER	In fact, I'm counting to ten right now... Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
F	SELINA	Okay, okay -
F	SELINA	My friend is waiting outside. Just hit 'send'...
F	JEN	Place is a little dead.
F	SELINA	It'll liven up in a minute, trust me.
F	JEN	Everything okay?
F	SELINA	Great. Catch you later. Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.
F	SELINA	It would've been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed.
M	STRYVER	We can't have loose ends. And even in that dress, no one's going to miss you.
F	SELINA	No. But my friend over there...? Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
F	SELINA	Every cop in the city's missing him. Stryver looks at Selina.
M	STRYVER	Cute. But they're not gonna be looking in a place like this.
F	SELINA	I don't know... You did just use his cell phone. Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
M	SWAT	It's alright, Miss. Just stay down The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
F	SELINA	Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart. She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar. Call me?
F	SELINA	There's a man in there - he's bleeding!
M	BLAKE	It's okay, Miss. It's okay. I've got the Congressman - bullet to the leg, but he's okay.
F	GORDON	Manhole!
F	GORDON	You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit -
M	SWAT	Where -?
F	GORDON	Get the DWP down here, now!
M	COP	Where's the DWP guy?
M	BLAKE	They went down there?
M	FOLEY	And Gordon took SWAT in after them.
M	BLAKE	Come on, we gotta get down there -
M	COP	That was a gas explosion, kid -
M	BLAKE	Gas? This is a sewer!
M	FOLEY	No one goes in there till we know what's down there.
M	BLAKE	We know what's down there, sir. The Police Commissioner!
M	FOLEY	Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy! Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.
M	THUG 1	Jesus. It's the Police Commissioner.
M	THUG 2	What do we do?
M	THUG 1	Take him to Bane. The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
M	BANE	Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.
M	THUG 1	Answer him! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.
M	BANE	I'm asking you.
M	THUG 1	It's the Police Commissioner.
M	BANE	And you brought him down here?
M	THUG 2	We didn't know what to do. We -
M	BANE	You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives.
M	THUG 1	No, he's alone - Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
M	BANE	Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
M	THUG 2	He's dead.
M	BANE	Then show me his body.
M	THUG 2	That water runs to any one of the outflows - we'd never find him. Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.
M	BANE	Give me your GPS. Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
M	BANE	Follow him.
M	THUG 2	Follow him?
M	BANE	Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel.
M	BLAKE	I need to see Bruce Wayne.
M	ALFRED	I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls. Even from police officers.
M	BLAKE	And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder? Would that still count as unscheduled?
M	WAYNE	What can I do for you, officer?
M	BLAKE	Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
M	WAYNE	I'm sorry to hear that -
M	BLAKE	He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called 'Bane'.
M	WAYNE	Shouldn't you be telling this to your superior officers?
M	BLAKE	I did. One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there. He needs you. He needs the Batman.
M	WAYNE	If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm the Batman he must be in a bad way He doesn't know or care who you are. (Off look.) But we've met before. When I was a kid. At the orphanage. See, my mom died when I was small. Car accident, I don't really remember it. But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget.
M	BLAKE	So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited - Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. We made up stories about you. Legends. The other boys' stories were just that. But when I saw you I knew who you really were... (Beat.) I'd seen that look on your face. Same one I taught myself. Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.
M	BLAKE	I don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder, but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not.
M	WAYNE	Why did you say your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?
M	BLAKE	Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help.
M	WAYNE	You checked that name? 'Bane' -
M	ALFRED	Ran it through some databases. He's a mercenary. No other known name. Never been seen or photographed without a mask. He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.
M	WAYNE	Now Daggett's brought them here?
M	ALFRED	It would seem so. I'll keep digging.
M	WAYNE	Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city? The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises...
M	WAYNE	Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
M	ALFRED	I'll get him on the phone -
M	WAYNE	No. Do we still have any cars around the place? One or two.
M	WAYNE	And I need an appointment at the hospital. About my leg.
M	ALFRED	Which hospital, sir?
M	WAYNE	Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.
M	MIRANDA (V.O.)	Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr. Wayne was trying to do...
F	MIRANDA	I'm only asking for explanations because I think I can help.
M	FOX	I'll pass along your request. Next time I see him. Miranda catches something in this.
F	MIRANDA	He doesn't talk to you either?
M	FOX	Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities. Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises? I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
M	FOX	Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.
M	FOX	What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne?
M	WAYNE	I see you haven't lost your sense of humor...even if you have lost most of my money.
M	FOX	Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive.
M	WAYNE	Even with -
M	FOX	A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in.
M	WAYNE	What're my options?
M	FOX	If you're not willing to turn your machine on -
M	WAYNE	I can't, Lucius.
M	FOX	Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely.
M	WAYNE	You too, Lucius?
M	FOX	We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine.
M	WAYNE	I'll think it over.
M	FOX	Anything else?
M	WAYNE	No, why?
M	FOX	These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests.
M	WAYNE	I retired.
M	FOX	Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden
M	WAYNE	I figured you'd have shut this place down.
M	FOX	It was always shut down, officially.
M	WAYNE	But all this new stuff?
M	FOX	After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof.
M	WAYNE	Why?
M	FOX	Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them... Wayne shakes his head.
M	FOX	Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg.
M	WAYNE	It's fine the use it gets these days.
M	FOX	Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk... Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes
M	WAYNE	Now you're just showing off.
M	FOX	Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation.
M	WAYNE	What's it called?
M	FOX	It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
M	FOX	Works great except for the autopilot.
M	WAYNE	What's wrong with that?
M	FOX	Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it.
M	WAYNE	Better mind?
M	FOX	I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.
M	WAYNE	I told you. I retired, Lucius.
M	DOCTOR	I've seen worse cartilage in knees
M	WAYNE	That's good -
M	DOCTOR	No, that's because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred-over quality of your body... (Takes a deep breath.) I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing. About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if you're bored I recommend you take up drinking, Mr. Wayne. Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
F	GORDON	We were in this together. Then you were gone...
M	WAYNE	The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.
F	GORDON	Built on a lie. Our lie. Now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it. Nobody will listen... The Batman has to come back. What if he doesn't exist anymore?
F	GORDON	He must. He must.
M	JEN (O.S.)	I told you - money first -
M	YUPPIE (O.S.)	Goddammit, you took my wallet!
F	SELINA	Get out. She took my wallet! Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.
F	SELINA	Now. She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
F	SELINA	I told you not to try it with the assholes, Jen.
F	JEN	They're all assholes.
F	SELINA	Okay, the assholes who hit.
F	JEN	I don't know what he's so upset about, he only had sixty bucks in here.
F	SELINA	Probably the watch.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Watch? Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.
M	PAPARAZZI	Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car.
M	PAPARAZZI 2	No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne, where you been hiding? Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
M	WAYNE	I'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -
M	GREETER	Right through here, Mr. Wayne...
M	MIRANDA (O.S)	Bruce Wayne at a charity ball? Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
M	WAYNE	Miss Tate, isn't it?
F	MIRANDA	Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things...
M	WAYNE	True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on.
F	MIRANDA	Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.
M	WAYNE	Oh.
F	MIRANDA	And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.
M	WAYNE	That's very generous of you.
F	MIRANDA	You have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our clean-energy project...
M	WAYNE	Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. Sorry.
F	MIRANDA	You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it... (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding... Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.
F	MIRANDA	Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne. Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.
M	WAYNE	Mind if I cut in? Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
M	WAYNE	You don't seem very happy to see me.
F	SELINA	You were supposed to be a shut-in.
M	WAYNE	Felt like some fresh air.
F	SELINA	Why didn't you call the police?
M	WAYNE	I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. (Admires her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a cat burglar.
F	SELINA	Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
M	WAYNE	Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?
F	SELINA	His wife's in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they'd get stolen. It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social climber.
F	SELINA	You think I care what anyone in this room thinks about me?
M	WAYNE	I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.
F	SELINA	Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me.
M	WAYNE	Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong people. You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.
M	WAYNE	Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
F	SELINA	I started off doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to.
M	WAYNE	Start fresh.
F	SELINA	There's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes. Or our achievements.
F	SELINA	The mistakes stick better. Trust me.
M	WAYNE	You think that justifies stealing?
F	SELINA	I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.
M	WAYNE	Robin Hood?
F	SELINA	I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.
M	WAYNE	Maybe you're assuming too much.
F	SELINA	Or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.
M	WAYNE	Ouch.
F	SELINA	You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
F	SELINA	There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.
M	WAYNE	Sounds like you're looking forward to it.
F	SELINA	I'm adaptable.
M	WAYNE	These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe... But I still can't let you keep them. You scared her off.
M	WAYNE	Not likely.
M	WAYNE	I must have lost my ticket -
M	VALET	Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir.
M	WAYNE	My wife?
M	ALFRED	Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things. Wayne dials his phone.
M	FOX (O.S.)	This is Fox.
M	WAYNE	Remember those 'unusual requests' I used to make? I knew it! Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.
M	ALFRED	You've got the wrong leg, sir.
M	WAYNE	You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns. Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
M	ALFRED	It is terribly painful? You're welcome to try it, Alfred.
M	ALFRED	Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.
M	WAYNE	Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
M	ALFRED	Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane.
M	WAYNE	I'm all ears.
M	ALFRED	There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes...the pit sends something back.
M	WAYNE	Bane.
M	ALFRED	Born and raised in a hell on earth.
M	WAYNE	Born in a prison?
M	ALFRED	No one knows why. Or how he escaped. But they know who trained him one he did...R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl. Your
M	A U	mentor.
M	ALFRED	He plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. Just like you.
M	WAYNE	Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.
M	ALFRED	Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for R¬Ø's
M	A	al Gh¬Øl is not to be trifled with.
M	WAYNE	I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.
M	ALFRED	That was then. And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. But it won't make you what you were.
M	WAYNE	Which was?
M	ALFRED	Someone whose anger at death made him value all life. Even his own.
M	WAYNE	If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me. The Batsuit emerges from the cube.
M	ALFRED	Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources, your knowledge...not your body. Not your life. That time has passed.
M	WAYNE	I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed.
M	ALFRED	You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, you can't afford to.
M	WAYNE	That's what you're afraid of - that if I go back out there I'll fail.
M	ALFRED	No. I'm afraid that you want to. Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.
M	TRADER 2	You can't short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party -
M	TRADER 1	Wayne coming back is change. Change is either good or bad.
M	TRADER 2	On what basis?
M	TRADER 1	I flipped a coin. Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
M	TRADER 3	No. Rye. I told 'em rye. Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen. Alright, I'll take it.
M	FEMALE SECURITY GUARD	Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at a camera.) We need faces for cameras. At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet. This is a stock exchange, there's no money you can steal - He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...
M	BANE	Why else would you people be here? Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
M	BANE	Enter your password. Or I send these men to your home.
M	BLAKE	Move it, now! We've got a situation.
M	CONSTRUCTION WORKER	Where can I move it?!
M	BLAKE	That way! Blake points - but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking.
M	BLAKE	Get in your vehicle and stay there! Foley and the SWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance.
M	SECURITY CHIEF	You've gotta get in there!
M	FOLEY	This is a hostage situation -
M	SECURITY CHIEF	It's a robbery! They've got direct access to the online trading desk.
M	FOLEY	I'm not risking my men for your
M	SECURITY CHIEF	It's not our money, it's everyone's!
M	ALLEN	Really? Mine's in my mattress.
M	SECURITY CHIEF	If you don't shut these guys down, the stuffing in that mattress might be worth a whole lot less, pal.
M	FOLEY	Cut the fiber line - shut down the cell tower. That'll slow them down.
M	SHOESHINE MAN	They cut the fiber. Cell's working.
M	BANE	For now. How much longer does the program need?
M	SHOESHINE MAN	Eight minutes.
M	BANE	Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack...
M	ALLEN	Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street! Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the
M	SNIPER	I've got something - The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and
M	ROOKIE COP	Shoot the tires!
M	VETERAN COP	No shot!
M	FOLEY	Back off, back off! They've got hostages!
M	ROOKIE COP	What's going on with the lights? The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are
M	VETERAN COP	It can't be...
M	ROOKIE COP	The hell was that?!
M	VETERAN COP	Oh boy. You're in for a show tonight, son.
M	FOLEY	Let's roll, they've spotted the Batman! Call everyone in - every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too! Pull 'em in, close every street! Now! Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by.
M	FOLEY	I'm gonna do what Gordon never could.
M	BLAKE	What's that?
M	FOLEY	I'm gonna take down the Batman.
M	BLAKE	Sir, what about the armed robbers? One bike's pulled off, no hostage - Should we pursue?
M	FOLEY	Negative! Stay on the Batman!
M	BLAKE	But he's getting away! Who do you want to catch? Some robber, or the son-of-a-bitch who killed Harvey Dent?
M	TV ANNOUNCER	People aren't saying much - frankly, they're too busy - but all signs suggest that what we're seeing is, in fact, the return of the Batman...
M	CATWOMAN	Well, what do you know? Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns. POLICE VOICE Batman looks at the line of stopped traffic. An empty car
M	DAGGETT	After eight years he has to pick tonight...
M	STRYVER	He's drawing the cops off Bane... Daggett watches, intrigued.
M	FOLEY	How did you let him go?! He's got a lot of firepower -
M	FOLEY	And you don't?! We're not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down, you hear me?! He's heading back downtown... Then he's as dumb as he dresses - close it down, gentlemen!
M	FOLEY	Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen... Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from
M	VETERAN COP	You might have the wrong animal there, sir -
M	BLAKE	Are you sure that was him? Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him. Police are keeping quiet about the prospect of a return by the Batman, but eyewitness accounts seem the clearly suggests the type of...
M	STRYVER	Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished.
M	DAGGETT	What about the men they arrested?
M	STRYVER	He says, and I quote, they would die before talking. Where does he find these guys? Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner Open the champagne...
M	DAGGETT	And can we get some girls in here? Careful what you wish for. Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back
M	CATWOMAN	Cat got your tongue? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.
M	DAGGETT	You dumb bitch.
M	CATWOMAN	Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.
M	DAGGETT	Dumb to show up here tonight.
M	CATWOMAN	I want what you owe me -
M	DAGGETT	'I want' never gets...
M	STRYVER	Nice outfit...those heels make it tough to walk?
M	CATWOMAN	I don't know, do they?
M	CATWOMAN	So where is it?
M	DAGGETT	Where's what?
M	CATWOMAN	The program. The 'Clean Slate'.
M	DAGGETT	Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I don't have it. The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
M	CATWOMAN	Where is it?
M	DAGGETT	The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true.
M	CATWOMAN	You're lying. Rykin Data took it to prototype stage -
M	DAGGETT	That's why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangland myth.
M	CATWOMAN	Stay back! They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
M	CATWOMAN	I'm not bluffing! They know...
M	BATMAN	They just don't care.
M	CATWOMAN	You've got to be kidding.
M	BATMAN	No guns. No killing.
M	CATWOMAN	Where's the fun in that? As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
M	BATMAN	Come on! Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
M	CATWOMAN	My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men -
M	BATMAN	This isn't a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
M	CATWOMAN	See you around - Batman steps down after her.
M	BATMAN	You're welcome.
M	CATWOMAN	I had it under control.
M	BATMAN	Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints. Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
M	CATWOMAN	Wayne wasn't kidding about a 'powerful friend'. I sold his prints to Daggett. For something that doesn't even exist.
M	BATMAN	I doubt many people get the better of you.
M	CATWOMAN	What were they going to do with them?
M	CATWOMAN	I don't know. But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market. Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
M	BATMAN	Miss Kyle -? But she is gone. So that's what that feels like.
M	ALFRED	Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower?
M	WAYNE	We bought all the neighbors. Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.
M	ALFRED	From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.
M	WAYNE	I retrieved this.
M	ALFRED	Shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence?
M	WAYNE	They don't have the tools to analyze it.
M	ALFRED	They would if you gave them to them
M	WAYNE	One man's tool is another man's weapon.
M	ALFRED	In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.
M	WAYNE	Alfred. Enough. The police weren't getting it done -
M	ALFRED	Perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of yourself.
M	WAYNE	Perhaps you're upset you were wrong.
M	ALFRED	Wrong?
M	WAYNE	You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
M	ALFRED	You don't. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then?
M	WAYNE	I'll fight harder, I always have.
M	ALFRED	for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life. Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
M	ALFRED	Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity, His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.
M	WAYNE	You said he was excommunicated.
M	ALFRED	By R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl. Who leads them
M	A U	now?
M	WAYNE	R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl was the League of
M	A U	Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's just a mercenary, and we have to find out what he's up to. Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.
M	WAYNE	Trades of some kind. Coded... The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.
M	ALFRED	Is that -?
M	WAYNE	Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle. Get this to Fox - he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing.
M	ALFRED	I'll get this to Fox. But no more. Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him. I've sewn you up and set your bones...but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.
M	WAYNE	You'd abandon me?
M	ALFRED	You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave -
M	WAYNE	Rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I can't just move on. She didn't. She couldn't.
M	ALFRED	What if he had? What if she wasn't intending to make a life with you?
M	WAYNE	She was, I can't change that -
M	ALFRED	What if, before she died, she'd written a letter? Explaining that she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you? Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -
M	ALFRED	And what if, to spare you pain...I'd burned that letter? Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.
M	WAYNE	Why would you say such a thing?
M	ALFRED	Because I have to make you understand.
M	WAYNE	You're lying.
M	ALFRED	Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I haven't.
M	WAYNE	You're lying!
M	ALFRED	I've never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachel's letter. Wayne turns on the old man, furious.
M	WAYNE	How dare you use Rachel to stop me!
M	ALFRED	I'm using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. I'm sorry.
M	WAYNE	Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!
M	ALFRED	No. I know what this means -
M	WAYNE	What does it mean, Alfred?!
M	ALFRED	It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
M	WAYNE	Goodbye, Alfred. Goodbye, Bruce. Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.
M	WAYNE	Alfred? But Alfred is gone.
M	FOX	Answering your own door?
M	WAYNE	Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive?
M	FOX	I didn't need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page:
M	FOX	It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.
M	FOX	Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.
M	WAYNE	The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -
M	FOX	Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story.
M	WAYNE	Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor -
M	FOX	We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed.
F	MIRANDA	You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?
M	FOX	Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.
M	FOX	Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
F	MIRANDA	This is it, isn't it?
M	FOX	The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.
F	MIRANDA	Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?
M	FOX	I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one. Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a I thought you might like to see what your investment built.
F	MIRANDA	No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city.
M	WAYNE	If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
M	WAYNE	Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction.
F	MIRANDA	You've built a lot of security around a damp squib. Nothing. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems... (Looks at Wayne.) I think this machine works.
M	WAYNE	Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great. Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?
M	WAYNE	Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.
F	MIRANDA	And to do what with it?
M	WAYNE	Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.
F	MIRANDA	And if we can't? Decommission it. Flood it.
F	MIRANDA	Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?
M	WAYNE	If the world's not ready. Yes.
F	MIRANDA	Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.
M	WAYNE	I'm trusting you.
F	MIRANDA	Doesn't count. You have no choice.
M	WAYNE	I could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me. Please. His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.
M	FOX	We have a board meeting to get to.
M	DAGGETT	I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here. Highly irregular, even if it is his family name above the door... All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.
M	FREDERICKS	Bruce Wayne's family built this And he himself has run it -
M	DAGGETT	Into the ground, sir. Anybody disagree? Check the value of your shares this morning. Gambling on crazy futures didn't just lose Mr. Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a lot of money. He needs to leave.
M	FOX	I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.
M	WAYNE	I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.
M	DAGGETT	Let's get down to business. Right away.
M	REPORTER	Wayne, how's it feel to be one of the people?!
M	COMPANY VALET	I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork
M	BLAKE (O.S.)	Looks like you need a lift. Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.
M	DAGGETT	How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?! Was she meeting with Wayne? Was she sleeping with Wayne?
M	STRYVER	Not that we know of -
M	DAGGETT	Clearly you don't 'know of' anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!
M	STRYVER	We told him it was urgent -
M	DAGGETT	Then where is the masked - Speak of the devil... Daggett turns. Bane is already there.
M	BANE	...and he shall appear.
M	DAGGETT	What the hell's going on?
M	BANE	The plan is proceeding as expected.
M	DAGGETT	You see me running Wayne Your stock exchange hit didn't work, friend. And now you've got my construction crews working all hours around the city? How's that supposed to help my company absorb Wayne's? BANE Leave us.
M	DAGGETT	You stay right there! I'm in charge! Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.
M	BANE	Do you feel in charge? Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.
M	DAGGETT	I've paid you a small fortune -
M	BANE	And that gives you power over me?
M	DAGGETT	What is this?
M	BANE	Your money and infrastructure have been important. Till now.
M	DAGGETT	What are you? Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the borrowed time you've all been living on...
M	DAGGETT	You are true evil...
M	BANE	I am necessary evil. Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.
M	BLAKE	When you began...why the mask?
M	WAYNE	To protect the people closest to me.
M	BLAKE	You're a loner with no family.
M	WAYNE	There are always people you care about. You just don't realize how much until they're gone. (Collects himself.) The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point.
M	BLAKE	It was damn good to see him back.
M	WAYNE	Not everybody agrees.
M	BLAKE	They'll figure it out in the end.
M	WAYNE	Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
M	BLAKE	Yeah, I've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help. You know what? Drop me in Old Town...
M	WAYNE	Don't wait. I'll get a cab.
M	BLAKE	You got money?
M	WAYNE	Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
M	JEN (O.S.)	I told you, money first.
M	WAYNE (O.S.)	I don't think so.
F	SELINA	He's not a mark. Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.
F	SELINA	And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway.
F	SELINA	Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But it's more that you've got right now.
M	WAYNE	Actually, they're letting me keep the house. SELINA The rich don't even go broke same as the rest of us, huh? Vacation?
F	SELINA	Let's just say that I've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you.
M	WAYNE	My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving.
F	SELINA	And how would he do that?
M	WAYNE	By giving you what you want.
F	SELINA	It doesn't exist.
M	WAYNE	He says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight.
F	SELINA	Why? He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.
F	SELINA	Tell him I'll think about it. Wayne nods, starts to leave.
F	SELINA	Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all your money.
M	WAYNE	No, you're not.
M	FOLEY	Can we help you, officer?
M	BLAKE	John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know.
F	GORDON	Why?
M	BLAKE	Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
M	BLAKE	MTA maintenance, sewer construction... Where did you get to with the tunnel searches? Remind me to tell the detail to We've had teams down there, but it's a huge network -
F	GORDON	Get more men, work a grid. I want him found.
M	FOLEY	Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're on it.
F	GORDON	This is good work. Lose the uniform - you're working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here.
M	BLAKE	This could just be a coincidence.
F	GORDON	You're a detective now, son, you're not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore. Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.
M	MIRANDA (O.S)	Nobody's answering. Wayne turns to find Miranda there.
M	WAYNE	No. I'm on my own now.
F	MIRANDA	Do you have keys? Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.
M	WAYNE	Never needed them... She takes his hand.
F	MIRANDA	Let's find a window.
F	MIRANDA	Fox worked the board like you've never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out and he's not happy. Wayne sets down the newspaper:
M	WAYNE	Hope you don't like me for your money. Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
F	MIRANDA	Suffering builds character. Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.
F	MIRANDA	I'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce. Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.
F	MIRANDA	Who's this? Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...
F	MIRANDA	Where's Alfred?
M	WAYNE	He left. Taking everything. Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
F	MIRANDA	What's that? WAYNE I think my power's been shut off.
M	WAYNE	You're pretty good at that.
F	MIRANDA	When I was a child we had almost nothing. But on the nights we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed. She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.
M	WAYNE	I assumed your family was wealthy.
F	MIRANDA	Not always. Not when I was young.
F	MIRANDA	An old mistake.
M	WAYNE	I've made a few myself. She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.
F	MIRANDA	More than a few... (Smiles.) We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane. Go anywhere we wanted.
M	WAYNE	Someday perhaps. Not tonight. She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
M	CATWOMAN	Don't be shy.
M	CATWOMAN	Wayne says you can get me the 'Clean Slate'.
M	BATMAN	That depends.
M	CATWOMAN	On what?
M	BATMAN	On what you want it for. I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands.
M	CATWOMAN	Still don't trust me, huh? How can we change that?
M	BATMAN	Start by taking me to Bane. You asked. Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
M	CATWOMAN	From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels...and they are not your average brawlers.
M	BATMAN	Neither am I. Catwoman swings into a -
M	CATWOMAN	He's behind you. MERCENARY Who? Batman hangs upside down behind him. Me. Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
M	CATWOMAN	Just a little further. A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
M	CATWOMAN	I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me.
M	BATMAN	You've made a serious mistake.
M	BANE (O.S.)	Not as serious as yours, I fear. Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.
M	BATMAN	Bane.
M	BANE	Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne.
M	BANE	Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you.
M	BANE	Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated. Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.
M	BANE	But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us...
M	BATMAN	Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths.
M	BANE	Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl's
M	A U	destiny... Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
M	BANE	You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
M	BANE	You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it...
M	BANE	I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding...
M	BANE	The shadows betray you, because they belong to me...
M	BANE	I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you.
M	BATMAN	No...
M	BANE	Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.
M	BANE	I wondered which would break first - your spirit...
M	HIGH.	...or your body. Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him I've got a line on the Congressman's kidnapping.
M	UNIFORM	Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your ticket and identification, please.
F	SELINA	Would you mind?
M	BLAKE	I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what?
F	SELINA	Don't tell me, still in love?
M	BLAKE	Head over heels. Pressing charges, though. Blake lays a police file down with a thump. You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.
F	SELINA	Girl's gonna eat.
M	BLAKE	You have an appetite. Why run? You can't hide from us with this record.
F	SELINA	Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
M	BLAKE	Who then? Bane? What do you know about him? SELINA That you should be as afraid of him as I am.
M	BLAKE	We can offer you protection... Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
M	BLAKE	When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend...Bruce Wayne. Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.
M	BLAKE	Did they kill him?
F	SELINA	I'm not sure. And we - BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights:
M	WAYNE	Why didn't you just kill me?
M	BANE	You don't fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment is to be more severe. WAYNE You're a torturer...
M	BANE	Yes. But not of your body. Of your soul. Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.
M	WAYNE	Where am I?
M	BANE	Home. despair. As will you. (Rises.) There is a reason that this prison is the worst hell on earth... Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So simple. So easy. And, like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned that there can be no true despair without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamber over each other to stay in the sun... Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars. entire city to cause you pain you thought you could never feel again. Then, when you have truly understood the depths of your failure, we will fulfill R¬Ø's al
M	A	Gh¬Øl's destiny. We will destroy
M	U	Gotham. And when it is done...when Gotham is ashes...then you have my permission to die. Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.
M	GUARD	We're locking her up in here?
M	WARDEN	The Dent Act allows non-segregation based on extraordinary need. First time she broke out of women's correctional she was sixteen. Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...
M	HUGE INMATE	Little closer, baby...
F	SELINA	Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?
M	WARDEN	She'll be just fine.
M	FOX	I don't see the need for a board meeting on the energy project -
F	MIRANDA	Bruce got a lot of things right. Keeping the board in the dark wasn't one of them... Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...
M	BANE	This meeting is called to order. Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.
M	BANE	Chair and President. I also need one ordinary member - Mr. Fox, would you care to nominate?
M	FREDERICKS	No. I volunteer. The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
M	FOX	Where are you taking us?
M	BANE	Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham.
F	GORDON	So you think our friend is gone again? This time...he might not be coming back. Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.
M	FOLEY	Okay, Commissioner, you were right.
F	GORDON	What's happened?
M	FOLEY	Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers.
F	GORDON	No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out.
M	FOLEY	The Mayor won't want panic -
M	BLAKE	So it's a training exercise.
M	FOLEY	I'm sorry for not taking you Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is...just fight to make it true.
F	GORDON	Not you. You're telling me the Batman's gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can.
M	PRISONER	He asks if you would pay us to let you die. I told him you have nothing.
M	WAYNE	Do it for the pleasure.
M	PRISONER	They pay me more than that to keep you alive.
M	PRISONER	He will try the climb. Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant
M	WAYNE	Has anyone made it?
M	PRISONER	Of course not.
M	WAYNE	What does he say?
M	PRISONER	He says there is one who did. A child...
M	PRISONER	A child who had been born in this hell...
M	WAYNE	Bane.
M	PRISONER	An old legend. Nothing more. The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.
M	WAYNE	Don't.
M	PRISONER	Whatever they want you to see...it's happening soon.
M	BANE	Turn it on.
M	BANE	I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs. I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
F	MIRANDA	Alright, stop. She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
F	MIRANDA	Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down. Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
M	BANE	Do your work. Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages. their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization. Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.
M	REPORTER	We're seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers -
M	MAYOR	A training exercise, that's all. If you'll excuse me, I've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City. The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds...
M	BLAKE	I've been to half Daggett's cement plants, logged locations they've poured for underground construction... Anything strange about the pourings? Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.
M	BLAKE	Honestly, Commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering.
F	GORDON	But you know about patterns. Keep looking. Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.
M	DR. PAVEL	It's done. This is now a four-megaton nuclear bomb.
M	BANE	Pull the core out of the reactor. You can't. This is the only power source capable of sustaning it - if you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months.
M	BANE	Five, by my calculations.
M	DR. PAVEL	And then it will go off.
M	BANE	For the sake of your family, Dr. Pavel, I hope so.
M	WORKER	Boss is about to leave. Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.
M	BLAKE	Hey. The Driver turns.
M	BLAKE	That was you outside the stock exchange, right?
M	DRIVER	When? were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out.
M	DRIVER	Oh yeah. You're that cop -
M	BLAKE	Detective, now.
M	BLAKE	And as a detective...I'm not allowed to believe in coincidences Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
M	BLAKE	What were you doing?! What?!
M	BLAKE	Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me - Commissioner, they've got Polyisobutylene here... (Looks around.) And motor oil. They weren't making cement, they were making explosives -
M	BLAKE	Oh, God.
M	BLAKE	Patch me into Foley! Foley's overseeing the operation -
M	BLAKE	They're heading into a trap!
M	FOLEY	Foley.
M	BLAKE	It's a trap! Pull everyone out! Bane's been pouring concrete laced with explosives -
M	FOLEY	Where?
M	BLAKE	There's a ring around the tunnels - they're gonna blow it and trap the cops underground! Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel.
M	FOLEY	Pull out! Pull 'em out!
M	BANE	Let the games begin. The Mercenaries hit the detonators.
M	BANE	Gotham, take control of your city...
M	BLAKE	Foley? Jesus, Blake! Every cop in the city's down in those tunnels! Not every cop...
M	GORDON (O.S.)	Clear the corners, rookie. Blake turns. Gordon holds his service weapon. The
F	GORDON	Get my coat, son.
M	BANE	This is the instrument of your liberation...
M	ANALYST	Satellite shows a radiation spike... Whatever it is...it's nuclear.
M	BANE	Identify yourself to the world.
M	DR. PAVEL	Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist. Bane turns Dr. Pavel's head for the cameras.
M	CIA ANALYST	Pavel was confirmed dead - plane crash on an Agency pull-out of Uzbekistan... But it certainly looks like him - He points to a monitor with a photo of Dr. Pavel. An Air
M	BANE	Tell the world what this is.
M	DR. PAVEL	A fully primed neutron bomb. With a blast radius of six miles.
M	BANE	And who can disarm this device?
M	DR. PAVEL	Only me.
M	BANE	Thank you, Doctor. Bane snaps Dr. Pavel's neck in front of the world.
M	BANE	The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. One of you holds the detonator - we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people. At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait. Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours. Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men.
M	GENERAL	Pull back the fighters, start high-level reconnaissance flights. And get the President on the line.
M	LEAD MERCENARY	Tanks and planes cannot stop us detonating our device. Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication.
M	CAPTAIN	How many of you are there, son? (Nothing.) You don't have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island.
M	LEAD MERCENARY	We don't. But you do.
M	CAPTAIN	Why in the hell would we help you keep your hostages?
M	LEAD MERCENARY	If people start crossing this bridge Gotham gets blown to hell. The Captain considers this. Troubled. PRESIDENT The people of our greatest city are resilient. They have proven this before, they will prove this again... We do not negotiate with terrorists, but we do recognize realities... Wayne starts to cry. As the situation develops, one thing must be understood above all others... People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you.
M	BLAKE	What does that mean?
F	GORDON	It means we're on our own. I have to get in front of a camera -
M	BLAKE	Sir, they'll kill you the second you show your face -
F	GORDON	The Mayor's dead. I'm the symbol of law and order. Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people - they need to know that I could lead.
M	BLAKE	Bane's not gonna let that happen -
F	GORDON	Then he'll show his true colors.
M	BLAKE	And you'll be dead.
M	BANE	Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison...
M	BANE (O.S.)	Where a thousand men have languished for years. Under the Dent Act. Under the name of this
M	BANE	Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good...
M	BLAKE	We're gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a camera
M	BANE	But they supplied you a false idol. A straw man. To placate. To stop you tearing down this corrupt city... ...and rebuilding it the way it should have been rebuilt generations ago...
M	BANE	Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. In the words of Gotham's Police Commissioner, James Gordon...
M	BANE	'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey's rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved my boy. Then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes, so that I could, to my shame, build a lie around this fallen idol.' 'I praised the madman who tried to murder my own child.'
M	BANE	'The things we did in Harvey's name brought desperately needed security to our streets... But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign.' Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd. resignation?
M	BANE	Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!'
M	BLAKE	These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.
F	GORDON	A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in -
M	BLAKE	Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for.
F	GORDON	There's a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean.
M	BLAKE	Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner.
M	BANE	We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich. The oppressors of generations who've kept you down with the myth of opportunity. And we give it to you, the people. Gotham is yours - none shall interfere. Do as you please... But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed... Step forward, those who would serve...
M	BANE (V.O.)	For an army will be raised... Mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping Prisoners...
M	BANE (V.O.)	The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests... ...and cast into the cold world the rest of us have known and endured...
M	BANE (V.O.)	Courts will be convened... The spoils will be enjoyed... Blood will be shed...
M	BANE (V.O.)	But the police will live, until they are ready to serve true justice...
M	BANE (V.O.)	This great city will endure... Close enough to see the flickering digits of its Gotham will survive. Mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck. He says you must first straighten your back. The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully.
M	WAYNE	How would he know?
M	PRISONER	He was the prison doctor. A morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people. Including your masked friend.
M	WAYNE	How?
M	PRISONER	Many years ago, during a time of plague, Bane was attacked by other prisoners. The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony. The mask holds his pain at bay.
M	WAYNE	Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here? The legend is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter. They married in secret.
M	PRISONER	When the warlord found out, he condemned the mercenary to this pit. But then exiled him instead.
M	PRISONER	The mercenary understood that the warlord's daughter had secured his release, but he couldn't know the true price of his freedom. She had taken his place in the pit.
M	PRISONER	And she was with the child. The mercenary's child.
M	PRISONER	One day the doctor forgot the lock the cell...
M	PRISONER	Innocence cannot flower underground. It was to be stamped out. But the child had a friend. A protector...
M	PRISONER	...who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption. The mother was not so lucky. The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods.
M	PRISONER	This is Bane's prison now. Bane would not want this story told. The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled vertebra...I'm going to force it back...
M	WAYNE	How -?
M	PRISONER	You stay like this. Until you stand.
M	A U	Did you not think I'd return, Bruce? R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl, in his Ducard guise, steps in front of Wayne.
M	A U	I told you I was immortal.
M	WAYNE	I watched you die. R¬Ø'S AL GH¬ØL
M	A U	There are many forms of immortality. Wayne looks inward, remembering...
M	A U	Once I had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me...
M	WAYNE	You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir.
M	A U	An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization.
M	WAYNE	No...
M	A U	You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years. With all your strength and resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you could achieve was a lie. Finally you understand... Gotham is beyond saving...
M	A U	And must be allowed to die.
M	BLAKE	For the bus in case there's a chance to evacuate. Keep it in here - people are siphoning parked cars.
M	FATHER REILLY	Really? How do you think I got it?
M	FATHER REILLY	Right. Any news? Is the
M	BLAKE	Less you know, Father. How're the boys?
M	FATHER REILLY	Power's been on more, so they get some TV. Blake, you be careful out there. They're hunting down cops like dogs.
F	JEN	Who's that?
F	SELINA	This was someone's home.
F	JEN	Now it's everyone's home.
F	JEN	'Storm's coming', remember? This is what you wanted.
F	SELINA	No. It's what I thought I wanted.
M	PRISONER	Why build yourself?
M	WAYNE	I'm not meant to die in here. The Prisoner indicates the TV:
M	PRISONER	Here? There? What's the difference? Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body...
M	PRISONER	I told you it could not be done.
M	WAYNE	You told me a child did it...
M	PRISONER	No ordinary child... A child born in hell. hardened by pain... Not a man from privilege.
M	FOLEY	You have ID? Of course not.
M	FOLEY	How can we trust you? We don't have any choice.
M	SPECIAL FORCES 1	Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones, Special Forces.
F	GORDON	Captain, glad to have you here.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	How many of you are there?
F	GORDON	Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	What kind of shape they're in?
F	GORDON	They've been getting water, food.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	Could we break them out?
M	BLAKE	Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you've got a hole big enough for ten at a time. I'm in contact with my partner - they're waiting for the day.
M	SPECIAL FORCES 2	Men who haven't seen daylight for three months?
M	BLAKE	Men with automatic weapons who haven't seen daylight in three months.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	What about the bomb? The satellites can't see any radiation hot spots...
M	GORDON (V.O.)	They keep it on a truck - it must have a lead-lined roof. They move it constantly.
M	CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.)	But you know the truck? They've got three of them. The routes don't vary much. Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	What about the triggerman?
F	GORDON	No leads. It's a bluff - Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	We can't take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device, smuggle men over -
M	BLAKE	While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state?
M	CAPTAIN JONES	Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented. We can't do anything to risk millions of lives. BLAKE Aren't you gonna tell him?!
F	GORDON	Captain, things are more complicated than you think. There's somebody you need to meet. Blake? Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.
M	BLAKE	I was up here looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	Which corporation?
M	FOX (O.S.)	Wayne Enterprises. Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.
M	BLAKE	Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd like you to brief the Captain. Captain Jones indicates Miranda.
M	FOX	Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation.
F	MIRANDA	And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	Why?
F	MIRANDA	Because, Captain, we built it.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	You built the bomb?
M	FOX	It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor.
M	BLAKE	And here's the important part.
M	FOX	As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation.
M	BLAKE	The bomb's a time bomb.
M	FOX	And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news.
M	BLAKE	Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought. Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	Could you disarm it?
M	FOX	I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	We'd have to let the Pentagon know.
M	SPECIAL FORCES 2	They'll be monitoring our
M	CAPTAIN JONES	We have no choice. Let's move away from this location, then call it in.
M	BLAKE	Fox, somebody sold us out! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor. Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.
M	CAPTAIN JONES	I'll die before I talk...
M	BANE	I'm on your schedule, Captain.
M	MERCERNARY	There were people living upstairs.
M	BANE	Give them over for judgement. (Indicates bodies.) Hang them where the world will see.
M	PRISONER	He says the leap to freedom is not about strength. My body makes the jump. Survival is the spirit. The soul.
M	WAYNE	My soul's as ready to escape as my body.
M	BLIND PRISONER	Fear is why you fail.
M	WAYNE	I'm not afraid. I'm angry. He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
M	SKINNY PRISONER	Shouldn't you get him down? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.
M	PRISONER	He'll keep. As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -
M	THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.)	And why do we fall? You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. This makes you weak.
M	WAYNE	Why?
M	BLIND PRISONER	How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.
M	WAYNE	I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it.
M	BLIND PRISONER	Then make the climb.
M	WAYNE	How?
M	BLIND PRISONER	As the child did. Without the rope. (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find you again. Wayne considers this.
M	PRISONER	Supplies for your journey? Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
M	STRYVER	I want to see Bane! There's been a mistake! Take me to Bane! Fox watches him dragged upstairs...
M	STRYVER	There's been a mistake! Where's Bane?! There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.
M	CRANE	You are Philip Stryver, executive vice-president of Daggett The same Philip Stryver who for years lived like a prince off the blood and sweat of people less powerful?
M	STRYVER	Call Bane! I'm one of you! Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.
M	CRANE	Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing. The choice is yours, death or exile. Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
M	STRYVER	Exile. Sold...to the man in the cold sweat! Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock... Follow the tick ice. Try to swim - you're dead in minutes.
M	STRYVER	Has anyone made it? The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
F	GORDON	Where the hell are they? It's not like we have a lot of time, here.
M	COP	How long?
F	GORDON	The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've got about eighteen hours to do something. To do what?
F	GORDON	We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. That's it? Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.
F	GORDON	Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door.
M	BLAKE	You shouldn't be out on the streets
M	FOLEY'S WIFE	Jim. He's not here -
F	GORDON	You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under occupation?! Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.
M	FOLEY	Wait in the kitchen, honey.
F	GORDON	What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?
M	FOLEY	Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces.
F	GORDON	You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?
M	FOLEY	This is different and you know it. These guys run the city - the government's done a deal with them
F	GORDON	Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal -
M	FOLEY	You move against Bane, the triggerman's gonna hit the button -
F	GORDON	You think he's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people'?! You think this is part of some revolution? There's one man with his finger on the button - Bane.
M	FOLEY	We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this. If you still had family here maybe you'd - This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look, I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues. But we've got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell.
M	FOLEY	I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -
F	GORDON	Keep your head down? What's that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows?
M	FOLEY	You don't know that's going to happen. Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there. I hear you're looking for men, Commissioner. Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.
F	MIRANDA	How about me, instead?
F	GORDON	Miss Tate, I can't ask you -
F	MIRANDA	My company built it.
F	GORDON	Bruce Wayne built it.
F	MIRANDA	And he wanted to destroy it. It was me who didn't listen. Please. Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.
F	GORDON	Let's go.
M	GANGBANGER	You steal from us, you little bastard? They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
F	SELINA	You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.
F	SELINA	Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid.
M	KID	Now you're gonna take it.
F	SELINA	Just tax. She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.
M	WAYNE (O.S.)	Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
F	SELINA	You came back. I thought they'd killed you.
M	WAYNE	Not yet.
F	SELINA	If you're expecting an apology -
M	WAYNE	It wouldn't suit you. I need your help.
F	SELINA	And why would I help you?
M	WAYNE	For this. The 'Clean Slate'.
F	SELINA	You're gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you?
M	WAYNE	I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - it's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh.
F	SELINA	Start fresh? I can't even get off this island.
M	WAYNE	I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in. Why do you need Fox?
M	WAYNE	To save this city. Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way.
M	WAYNE	Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off.
F	SELINA	Get your powerful friend on the case. I'm trying. But I need Fox.
F	GORDON	Stay further up the block. (Points at Men.) They're gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down. As it approaches, hit this button. If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and I mark the truck. Okay? Heads up.
F	GORDON	Got it.
M	MERCENARY	Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest.
F	GORDON	On whose authority?
M	MERCERNARY	The people of Gotham. Find this one a spot, he's got a big day tomorrow. They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.
M	BASEMENT THUG 2	We all do. It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne... Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods
F	MIRANDA	Bruce? You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.
M	WAYNE	How long until the core ignites?
M	FOX	That bomb goes off in twelve hours.
M	WAYNE	Unless we can connect it to the reactor.
M	FOX	If you can get it there. I'll find a way to plug it back in. (Indicates Miranda.) Can you get Miranda out?
M	WAYNE	Not tonight. I'm sorry.
F	MIRANDA	Do what's necessary. Tonight I need you.
M	FOX	What for?
M	WAYNE	To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.
M	CATWOMAN	Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys himself... The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
M	WAYNE	I won't forget about you.
F	MIRANDA	I know.
M	FOX	I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
M	CATWOMAN	He should be so lucky. And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.
M	WAYNE	Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off.
M	FOX	They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference. Infrared doesn't have the range. It could only be micro-burst long wave... Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment:
M	WAYNE	Could you block it? Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...
M	CRANE	The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage... Do you have anything to say in your defense?
F	GORDON	No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this?
M	CRANE	More than you give Harvey's prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt is determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing. What's it to be, death or exile?
F	GORDON	Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you've got another think coming.
M	CRANE	Death, then?
F	GORDON	Looks that way.
M	CRANE	Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By exile.
M	BANE	Bring her to me.
M	LUCIUS	I think it's time to talk about my year-end bonus...
M	FOX	She fly pretty well?
M	WAYNE	Even without the autopilot...
M	FOX	Autopilot? That's what you're there for.
M	BATMAN (O.S.)	Light it up.
M	FOLEY'S KIDS	Dad! Check it out!
M	FOLEY'S WIFE	Honey, take a look! Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.
M	MERCENARY	Sir?
M	MERCENARY	You think it's really him?
M	BANE	Impossible... This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb. Get it onto the truck by sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts.
F	GORDON	When what starts?
M	BATMAN	War.
M	BLAKE	You missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.
M	BATMAN	If you're working alone, wear a mask.
M	BLAKE	No one cares who I am.
M	BATMAN	The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about.
M	BLAKE	Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that?
M	BATMAN	I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck.
M	BATMAN	On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
M	BLAKE	No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt?
M	BATMAN	That's to warn the men on the other side. Batman disappears into the shadows.
M	BLAKE	But how do we -? KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.
M	BLAKE	Okay.
M	BLAKE	What now?
M	BATMAN	All-out assault on Bane...but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge.
M	BLAKE	Why?
M	BATMAN	In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can.
M	BLAKE	Don't you need me here?
M	BATMAN	You've given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.
M	BLAKE	Thank you.
M	BATMAN	Don't thank me yet.
M	BLAKE	I might not get a chance later.
M	CATWOMAN	Oh, you shouldn't have... She hops on, feeling the controls.
M	BATMAN	The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people.
M	BATMAN	To start it, you -
M	CATWOMAN	I got it.
M	BATMAN	We've got forty-five minutes to save this city -
M	CATWOMAN	No, I've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you don't stand a chance against these guys.
M	BATMAN	With your help I might.
M	CATWOMAN	I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone. He looks at her.
M	BATMAN	There's more to you than that. She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.
M	CATWOMAN	Sorry to keep letting you down. He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring. Come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything...
M	BATMAN	Not everything. Not yet.
M	UPON.	The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.
M	FOLEY	There's only one police in this city. He steps forward. The line follows.
M	BANE	Open fire.
F	GORDON	Come on, come on...
M	BANE	You came back. To die with your city.
M	BATMAN	No. I came back to stop you.
F	GORDON	That's impossible... Come on! Cut over to Fifth!
M	BLAKE	Knock on doors, spread the word - the bomb's going to blow! Get out by the South Street tunnel, or over the bridge! Do two blocks, then get back to the bus! The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the
M	BANE	Stay back. He is mine - Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but
M	BATMAN	Give me the trigger! You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen - Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through
M	BANE	I broke you. How have you come back?
M	BATMAN	You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape? Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.
M	BANE	I never escaped - R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl
M	A U	rescued me. That is why I must fulfill his plan. That is why I must avenge his murder. The child of R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl made the But he is not the child of R¬Ø's al
M	A	Gh¬Øl...
M	U	Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear...
F	MIRANDA	I am. Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs... am a citizen...
M	MIRANDA/TALIA	My mother named me Talia before she was killed. The way I would've been killed if not for my protector...Bane.
M	BANE	Goodbye. Then is overrun.
M	TALIA	I climbed out of the pit... I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance - but by that time...the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend...my protector... Talia reaches up to touch Bane's mask.
M	A U	stop. R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl has found Bane, bandaged. The League took us in. Trained us...
M	TALIA (V.O.)	But my father could not accept Bane. R¬Ø's al Gh¬Øl watches Bane training. Turns away.
M	TALIA	He saw only a monster who could never be tamed. Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not truly forgive my father... Talia looks at Batman, cold. Until you murdered him.
M	BATMAN	He was trying to kill millions of innocent people -
M	TALIA	'Innocent' is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience... You see, it's the slow knife...the knife that takes its time, the knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between bones...that's the knife - Talia arms the trigger... - that cuts deepest. She hits the button - nothing.
M	BATMAN	Your knife may have been too slow... A Mercenary steps forward -
M	MERCENARY	The truck's under attack - Talia looks around, mind racing.
M	TALIA	Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a way to block my signal. No matter - (Looks at watch.) He's bought Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it detonates. Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a
M	TALIA	Not yet... I want him to feel the heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed. Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes, Goodbye, my friend. Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the
M	BANE	You'll have to imagine the fire - now. He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.
M	CATWOMAN	The whole no-guns thing? I don't feel as strongly about it as you do.
M	UNIFORM	Stay there! What are you doing?! Blake, MCU - I'm getting these boys to safety - Safety?! You're gonna get us all killed. Anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city - It's gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now.
M	UNIFORM	No one leaves the island. Orders -
M	BLAKE	Whose orders? Bane's?
M	UNIFORM	Police Department's.
M	BLAKE	Haven't you heard the shooting? The Batman's battling it out with Bane The Batman's dead. Look, Officer -
M	BLAKE	It's Detective -
M	UNIFORM	Well, Detective, you take one more step, we have to shoot you. Two more steps, we have to blow the bridge.
M	BLAKE	Wait for me back at the bus. The Boys walk back down the bridge... I need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the
M	BLAKE	Your orders are out of date! The situation's changed! Listen, I'm a cop like you. And I'm walking out there. Please don't shoot me. Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...
M	UNIFORM	Blow it! Before he reaches the line His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake -
M	UNIFORM	Get down! We're blowing the bridge! As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him
M	BLAKE	You idiots! You sons of bitches! You're killing us!!
M	BLAKE	Father! Get the boys on the bus -
M	FATHER REILLY	But there's nowhere to go, son. They're trying to force us onto
M	TALIA	Pushing us to the entrance of the reactor. They're going to try and reconnect the core. Can they?
F	GORDON	Give me a hand! The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try Let's get a cable on it and drag it out! Come on, we're almost there - Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
M	TALIA	Fox showed me how to operate the reactor core. Including the emergency flood -
M	TALIA	There is no way to stop this bomb. Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at Batman.) My father's work is done.
F	GORDON	What're you doing?
M	BATMAN	Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay...
M	CATWOMAN	Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail -
M	BATMAN	No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her.
M	CATWOMAN	You could've gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here.
M	BATMAN	So did you.
M	CATWOMAN	I guess we're both suckers. She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back?
M	BLAKE	Come on! On the bus!
M	FATHER REILLY	What're you doing?
M	BLAKE	Protection from the blast -
M	FATHER REILLY	It's an atom bomb -!
M	BLAKE	You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope?
F	GORDON	I never cared who you were -
M	BATMAN	And you were right.
F	GORDON	But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?
M	BATMAN	A hero can be anyone. That was always the point. simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended... The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers Gordon looks up to the cockpit -
F	GORDON	Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
M	BLAKE	Heads down! Heads down, now! Blake, they need to make their peace. Blake turns to him, furious.
M	BLAKE	They're children! They have no peace to make - An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
M	LITTLE BOY	No. That's Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
M	GORDON (V.O.)	'I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss...' Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river. 'I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy...'
F	GORDON	'I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. I go to than I have ever known.' Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
M	ALFRED	I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you. And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.
F	GORDON	Can I change your mind about quitting the force?
M	BLAKE	No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. The injustice. (Gestures at gardens.) I mean...no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city.
F	GORDON	They know. (Off look.) It was Batman. Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate...
F	LAWYER	Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of... The contents of the house are to be He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake. - to settle the estate's accounts. The remainder is left in its entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...
F	LAWYER	The house and grounds are left to the city of Gotham, on condition that they never be demolished, altered, or otherwise interfered
M	LAWYER (V.O.)	And that they shall be used for one purpose, and one purpose only... A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children The housing and care of the city's at-risk and orphaned children. A sign reads:
F	LAWYER	My clerk will help anyone with the smaller correspondences and instructions... Blake approaches the Clerk. She smiles.
M	BLAKE	Blake, John. Nothing here. Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.
M	BLAKE	Try my legal name.
M	CLERK	Yup, here it is.
M	CLERK	You should use your full name. I like that name... Robin.
F	LAWYER	Any word on the missing item?
M	CLERK	No, not yet.
F	LAWYER	Well, they'd better leave no stone unturned... We can't just put a string of pearls on the manifest as 'lost'.
M	TECH 1	Why worry about the stabilization software? This whole autopilot system's obsolete -
M	FOX	Please, I just need to know what I could've done to fix it.
M	TECH 2	But Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software patch...six months ago. Check the user ident on the patch...
M	TECH 2	Huh. Bruce Wayne.
M	WAITER	Lei e solo?
M	ALFRED	Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia.
