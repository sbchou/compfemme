M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SECOND REVISED DRAFT	October 2, 1987
M	SALESMAN'S VOICE	You don't like flying, do you?
F	MCCLANE	No, no, where'd you get that idea?
M	SALESMAN	Ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel? After you get where you're going, ya take off your shoes and socks. Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes.
F	MCCLANE	Fists with your toes.
M	SALESMAN	Maybe it's not a fist when it's your toes...I mean like this...work out that time zone tension. Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag. I know it sounds crazy. Trust me. I've been doing it for nine years.
F	MCCLANE	It's okay. I'm a cop. Trust me. I've been doing it for eleven. this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat COLLIDING WITH:
M	STEWARDESS	Maybe you should have bought her a ticket.
F	MCCLANE	Her?
F	MCCLANE	She doesn't complain.
M	STEWARDESS	Neither would I. down the aisle.
M	TAKAGI	Ladies and gentlemen...I congratulate each and every one of you for making this one of the greatest days in the history of the Nakatomi corporation... slicked-back hair, he looks and acts very smooth.
M	ELLIS	What about dinner? Harry, it's Christmas Eve. Families... Stockings...chestnuts...Rudolph and Frosty...those things ring a bell?
M	ELLIS	I was thinking more of roaring fireplaces...mulled wine and a nice brie...
F	HOLLY	Ginny, it's 6:40, you're making me feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge. Go on, join the party, have some champagne.
F	GINNY	Thanks Ms. Gennaro. Do you think the baby can handle a little sip?
F	HOLLY	Ginny, that baby's ready to tend bar.
M	ELLIS	How about tomorrow night? and we:
F	LUCY	McClane residence. Lucy McClane speaking. tough business exterior.
F	HOLLY	Hello, Lucy McClane. This is your mother.
F	LUCY	Mommy! When are you coming home?!
F	HOLLY	Soon. You'll be in bed when I get there, though.
F	LUCY	Will you come say 'good night'?
F	HOLLY	Don't I always, you goose? Now put Paulina on the line, and no searching the house for presents!
F	LUCY	I didn't look in the front closet under the steps! Is Daddy coming home with you?
M	JOHN, JR.	Yeah! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! And a Captain Power!
F	HOLLY	Well, we'll see what Santa and Mommy can do. Goose, put Paulina on, okay?
F	PAULINA	Hello, Mrs. Holly. You coming home soon?
F	HOLLY	I'm working on it. Did Mr. McClane call? *
F	PAULINA	No ma'am.
F	HOLLY	Well...maybe there wasn't time before * the flight. You should probably make up the spare room just in case.
F	PAULINA	Yes, Mrs. Holly. I do that already. *
F	MCCLANE	California.
F	MCCLANE	I'm John McClane.
M	ARGYLE	Argyle. I'm your limo driver. Hey, nice bag.
F	MCCLANE	Argyle. Don't you take this stuff?
M	ARGYLE	Do I? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.
F	MCCLANE	That's okay. This is my first time riding in one.
M	ARGYLE	Just kick back and relax, man. We got everything you need: CD, CB, TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.
M	ARGYLE	If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears. ...Or is he married?
F	MCCLANE	Married.
M	ARGYLE	The girl was off today. Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. So, your lady live out here?
F	MCCLANE	The past six months.
M	ARGYLE	Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
F	MCCLANE	You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
M	ARGYLE	Hey, I'm sorry. When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
F	MCCLANE	It's okay, it's okay.
M	ARGYLE	So, you divorced of what?
F	MCCLANE	She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
M	ARGYLE	But meant her moving here.
F	MCCLANE	Closer to Japan. You're fast.
M	ARGYLE	So, why didn't you come?
F	MCCLANE	'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
M	ARGYLE	You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
F	MCCLANE	Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
M	ARGYLE	Mind if I play some tunes?
F	MCCLANE	How 'bout some Christmas music?
M	ARGYLE	That is Christmas music. trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has its own unique style. which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to
M	ARGYLE	So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms. Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
F	MCCLANE	It's corny, but I could live with it.
M	ARGYLE	What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
F	MCCLANE	I'll find someplace.
M	ARGYLE	Tell you what. I'll pull into the parking garage and wait. You score with your wife give me a call on the car phone and I'll leave your bags inside at the desk. You strike out... I'll get you to a hotel.
F	MCCLANE	You're all right, Argyle.
M	ARGYLE	Just remember that when you sign for the tip. They're paying for it, so don't be shy. SECURITY GUARD hidden until now behind a massive desk.
F	MCCLANE	Holly McClane?
M	GUARD	Just type it in there.
F	MCCLANE	Cute toy.
M	GUARD	Yeah. When you have to take a leak it'll help you find your zipper.
F	MCCLANE	Thirtieth floor... *
M	GUARD	Take the express elevator and get off at the noise.
F	MCCLANE	Lots of hardware... realizes -- it's the party. As the doors open the noise him.
F	MCCLANE	California...
F	MCCLANE	Excuse me, I'm looking for --
M	TAKAGI	Holly Gennero?
F	MCCLANE	Yeah. How'd you know?
M	TAKAGI	I've spent half my life on airplanes, * I can recognize someone who just got off one. I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane. I have ...something to do with this company.
F	MCCLANE	So I've heard.
M	TAKAGI	Holly went to the Vault room to FAX some documents...she should be back any...
M	ELLIS	Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick call, and this was the nearest phone...
M	TAKAGI	Ellis, this is John McClane... Holly's policeman? Ellis is in charge of International Acquisitions.
F	MCCLANE	That explains the recent deal with Bolivia.
F	MCCLANE	Relax, Ellis. I'm off duty.
M	TAKAGI	Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
F	MCCLANE	I'm fine. You throw quite a party. I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
M	TAKAGI	Hey, we're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
M	ELLIS	Actually, it's kind of a double celebration. * We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly.
F	HOLLY	All set, Joe. The contracts went over the wire, and -- John...!
F	HOLLY	I was hoping you made that flight.
M	JOHN	I was hoping you were hoping that.
M	TAKAGI	You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
F	MCCLANE	Yeah. I remember our first date.
M	ELLIS	Show him the watch.
M	ELLIS	Go on, show him. What're you, embarrassed? A little token of our appreciation for all her work.
F	MCCLANE	Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync. I think it's me. Is there a place I can wash up?
F	HOLLY	Sure. Follow me.
F	MCCLANE	Son-of-a-bitch. It works.
F	HOLLY	What are you doing?
F	MCCLANE	It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
F	HOLLY	That's okay... ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
F	HOLLY	So, where are you staying? This * all happened so fast I didn't even ask you on the phone.
F	MCCLANE	Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago. He said I could bunk with him.
F	HOLLY	Oh...Where does he live?
F	MCCLANE	Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
F	HOLLY	Pomona! You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy. I have a spare bedroom. It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
F	MCCLANE	They would, huh?
F	HOLLY	I would too. They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that
F	HOLLY	...I've missed you. *
F	MCCLANE	Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
F	HOLLY	This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
F	MCCLANE	Sure. It's unnerving. I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
F	HOLLY	Didn't we have this same conversation in July? Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
F	MCCLANE	No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
F	HOLLY	My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
F	MCCLANE	Oh, here it comes. One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
F	HOLLY	You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad. I needed that, John. I deserved that.
F	GINNY	Miz Gennero? Mr. Takagi is looking for you...he wants you to say something to the troops...
F	HOLLY	Thanks, Ginny. I'll be a second. Oh, this is --
F	MCCLANE	Hi. John Gennero here. I'm the sensitive and supportive man of the eighties.
F	HOLLY	I'll be a few minutes. Wait here --
F	MCCLANE	Don't I always?
F	MCCLANE	Schmuck!
M	MAN #1 (THEO)	...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen, this is a great play -- feeds Worthy on the break, over to A.C., to Magic, back to Worthy in the lane and --
M	THEO	Boom...two points.
M	THEO	We're in. him. Engineering. Karl comes over, gives his an elder brother's
F	MCCLANE	Argyle...?
M	ARGYLE	Hey, John, what's the word on you and your lady?
M	MCCLANE'S VOICE	The vote's not in yet.
M	ARGYLE'S VOICE	'Vote's not in yet?' What's that supposed to mean.
F	MCCLANE	What do you want, 'All My Children'? We're making progress. After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can --
M	ARGYLE	What?...Mr. Mac, you there?
M	ARGYLE	Well, call me back, John. You got the number. furniture in its original plastic wrappings are everywhere.
F	MCCLANE	Shit... a call on her high-tech phone. It seems so easy.
F	MCCLANE	Think... hand "reassuringly."
M	HANS	Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of greed around the globe, it is about to be taught a lesson on real power. You...will be witnesses. If our demands are not met, however -- -- You may become participants instead. Now, where is...'Takagi'? Where is the man who... ...used to be in charge here?
M	HANS	Mr. Takagi. How do you do. My name is Hans Gruber.
F	MCCLANE	32 construction...33 computers...
M	HANS	Nice suit. John Philips...London?
M	HANS	I have two myself. I'm told Arafat shops there too...
M	HANS *	And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept. For there were no more worlds to conquer. The benefits of a classical education.
M	HANS	It's beautiful. I always enjoyed models as a boy. The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
M	TAKAGI	This is what this is about? Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
M	HANS	I believe you. I read the article in Forbes. *
M	HANS	Mr. Takagi, we could discuss industrialization of men's fashions all day, but I'm afraid my associate, Mr. Theo, has some questions for you. Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions actually...
M	BOARD WORKSTATION.	ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY _ _ _ _.
M	TAKAGI	I don't have that code...! You broke in here to access out computer?!? Any information you could get -- they wake up in Tokyo in the morning, they'll change it! You won't be able to blackmail our executives or threaten --
M	HANS	SIT DOWN!
M	HANS	Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your computer. I'm interested in the 640 million dollars in negotiable bearer bonds you have in you vault.
M	HANS	Yes...I know about them. The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
M	TAKAGI	You want...money? What kind of terrorists are you?
M	HANS	Who said we were terrorists?
M	HANS	The code key, please...?
M	TAKAGI	It's useless to you! There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them! You'll never get it open!
M	HANS	Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
M	THEO	I told you...
M	KARL	It's not over...
M	HANS	This is too nice a suit to ruin, Mr. Takagi. I'm going to count to three. There will not be a four. Give me the code.
M	TAKAGI	I don't know it! get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you! You're just going to have to kill me --
M	HANS	Okay.
M	HANS	We do it the hard way! Tony, see if you can dispose of that. (the body) Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's work up on the machine floor. locked.
M	KARL	Nothing...
M	HANS	See to Heinrich... Now...you can break the code key...?
M	THEO	You didn't bring me along for my charming personality.
M	THEO	'Though you could have...
F	MCCLANE	Argyle. Tell me you heard the shot. Tell me you heard the shot and you're calling the police right now...
M	ARGYLE	I'm working, honey. Working hard. 'Course I'll be by later to pick you up, have I ever lies to you? My boss? He thinks I'm cruising to Palm Springs...
M	HANS	How long?
M	THEO	Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
M	HANS	If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
F	MCCLANE	Why the fuck didn't you stop him? Because, you ignorant sonofabitch, you'd be dead, too. Think...think, Goddamnit!
M	911 DISPATCHER	Main Wilshire units. Two alarm fire at Nakatomi Plaza --
F	MCCLANE	C'mon, baby...come to Papa. I'm gonna kiss your Goddamn dalmatian.
M	HANS	Call 911, give them the name and badge number on your uniform and cancel the alarm...then disable the system. Eddie? What floor did the alarm go off? Avenue of the Stars.
F	MCCLANE	Son of a bitch...
M	TONY	The fire has been called off, my friend. No one is coming to help you. You might as well come out and join the others. I promise not to hurt you.
F	MCCLANE	Freeze, Police...don't move or name your beneficiary.
M	TONY	You won't hurt me.
F	MCCLANE	Yeah? Why not?
M	TONY	Because you are a policeman. There are rules for policemen.
F	MCCLANE	Yeah. My Captain keeps telling me the same thing.
F	MCCLANE	Let's go.
F	MCCLANE	A million terrorists in the world and I kill the one with feet smaller than my sister.
M	HANS	I wanted this to be professional, efficient, adult, cooperative. Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see it that way... So he won't be joining us for the rest of his life. We are prepared to go any way you make us. When we have achieved our aims you can walk out of here... or be carried out. Decide now, each of you. But remember that we have planned everything to the last detail. We are completely in change.
M	HANS	Get them over there. Schnell!
M	FRITZ	Perhaps a security guard we overlooked...?
M	HANS	Security guard? They're usually tired and burned out old policemen growing * fat on a pension...This is... something else.
M	FRITZ'S VOICE	We have to do something, Hans.
M	HANS' VOICE	Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother is dead. Tell him to come down.
M	HANS	Franco, you and Fritz take the body upstairs and out of sight. I don't want the hostages to think too much. HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below. You don't
F	MCCLANE	Jesus...
M	HANS	I know what you are feeling. But this is not productive --
M	KARL	He was my only brother...my only family! I want blood for my blood. We search...now.
M	HANS	No. Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault. After the * police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search * for this man. Until then...we do not alter the plan.
M	KARL	And if he alters it...? *
M	ELLIS	What's happening?
F	HOLLY	They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
M	ELLIS	The police...?
F	HOLLY	John.
M	ELLIS	John? Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
F	HOLLY	How about his job? His 'job' is 3000 miles away. Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
F	HOLLY	Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
F	MCCLANE	Mayday, Mayday! Anyone! Terrorists have seized and Nakatomi building and are holding 30 or more hostages! I say again --
M	MCCLANE'S VOICE	-- unknown number of terrorists, six or more, armed with automatic weapons at Nakatomi, Century City... Somebody answer me, Goddamnit!
M	HANS	The roof. It's the best place to transmit.
M	DISPATCHER	It's the same address as that fire signal -- *
M	SUPERVISOR	-- the false alarm? I'll handle * it.
M	SUPERVISOR	Attention, whoever you are. This channel is reserved for emergency calls only --
M	MCCLANE'S VOICE	No fucking shit, lady! Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?
M	KARL	No one kills him but me.
F	MCCLANE	They've already killed one hostage, and they're fortifying their positions while we're bullshitting! Now, send police backup ASAP!
M	SUPERVISOR'S VOICE	Sir, I've already told you, this is a reserved channel. If this is an emergency call, dial 911 on your telephone. Otherwise I will report you to the police --
F	MCCLANE	-- fine! Report me! Hey, come down here and fucking arrest me! Send the police. NOW -- !
M	SUPERVISOR	Ad...have a black-and-white do a drive-by.
M	CLERK	Thought you guys just ate donuts.
M	POWELL	They're for my wife. She's pregnant. If I knew she was gonna eat a dozen at a shot, I woulda bought stock in the company.
M	DISPATCHER'S VOICE/RADIO	Dispatch to One Adam Ten, over.
M	POWELL	One Adam Ten, go ahead.
M	DISPATCHER'S VOICE/RADIO	Investigate a code two at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.
M	POWELL	Nakatomi Plaza?
M	DISPATCH VOICE	One Adam Ten, do you copy?
M	POWELL	Roger, dispatch. I'm on the way.
M	HANS' VOICE	Karl? Franco? Did you catch him?
M	FRANCO	No, but he's in the elevator shaft.
M	HANS' VOICE	Prefect. The elevators are locked off. * He can't escape. Just shut him in and return to base.
M	KARL	Hans, he killed by brother --
M	HANS	Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it! Karl? Karl! When they're gone...he will be too.
F	MCCLANE	Whew...for a moment there I was worried.
M	FRANCO	Nothing.
M	FRANCO	Nothing. concrete -- moving slowly below the duct. door and calls:
M	FRANCO	Karl! Police! Come on. him a GIANT DRILL.
M	THEO	You bet your ass I'm gonna proceed.
M	POWELL	Guard inside. No signs of disturbance ...I'm going up for a closer look.
M	HANS	Eddie?
M	EDDIE	Had a feeling you'd be calling...
M	HANS' VOICE	Let him in.
M	EDDIE	Evening, officer. What's up?
M	POWELL	We got an emergency call that there was a problem here.
F	MCCLANE	All right!
F	MCCLANE	Where's the fucking cavalry?
M	EDDIE	We already had that false alarm, you ask me, the Goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase. They been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it. Oh, shit, come on, I got fifty bucks on you assholes -- !
F	MCCLANE	Come on, come on...who's in that car, Stevie Wonder? 156-A
F	MCCLANE	Drop it or you're a rugstain.
M	HEINRICH	Marco, duck!
M	POWELL	Screw this.
M	MARCO	Next time -- don't hesitate.
F	MCCLANE	Thanks for the advice.
M	POWELL	Sorry to water your time. Merry Christmas.
F	MCCLANE	Oh, man, please, no --
M	POWELL	One Adam Ten to 6421. We had a wild goose chase on that 436. Everything's okay here. Over. 'Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the...the uh, dum, de dum's delightful...'
M	DISPATCHER'S VOICE	Roger, One Adam Ten. We thought it was a crank call anyway. Clear to code eight.
M	POWELL	Roger. '...let is snow, let it snow, let it snow -- '
M	POWELL	-- Jesus H. Christ! 6421, this is One Adam Ten --
M	DISPATCHER'S VOICE	Roger, One Adam Ten, please repeat.
M	POWELL	One Adam Ten, under automatic rifle fire at Nakatomi! Requesting immediate backup and SWAT assistance...
F	MCCLANE	Welcome to the party, pal.
M	THORNBURG *	-- of course I can get us a table, Wolfgang and me, we're like that. I interviewed him...hold on, * babe...
M	POLICE SCANNER	-- attention all units. Officer pinned down by automatic weapon fire at Nakatomi, Century City --
M	POWELL'S VOICE	-- guys, you want to cut through the red tape? They practically turned this car into Swiss cheese -- !
F	THORNBURG	All right...!
F	THORNBURG	Mary, this is Dick. I want a remote truck and a crew to meet me at the South gate in fifteen minutes... Damn right, fifteen... Where are we going? For an Emmy!
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Richard? Richard?
M	ELLIS	I never through I'd love to hear that sound.
M	HANS	-- all of you, stay at your posts! We knew that police action was inevitable... ...In fact, it's necessary. So let them start their feeble efforts; until them, stay calm. We have the hostages, remember. We are still in charge.
M	HANS	I told all of you...I want radio silence until further -- to "12 (?) minus 3 = 9" and added other information. As he sidearms, etc.
F	MCCLANE	Gee, I'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the message. You shoulda put it on the bulletin board. Anyway, I thought you and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that I waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy. So I invited some of the guys from my card game.
M	FRANCO *	How...how does he know so much about --
M	HANS	Ah, how nice of you to call. I assume you are our mysterious party crasher. You are most troublesome for a...security guard?
F	MCCLANE	BZZZ! Sorry, Hans, wrong guess. Would you like to go for Double Jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the scores really change?
F	MCCLANE	Bad for your health anyway.
M	HANS	Who are you, then?
F	MCCLANE	Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass - PLASTIQUE the size of an electric razor. He WHISTLES in
M	HANS	Check on all the others...don't use the radio. See if he's lying about Marco and find out if anyone * else is missing. * a corridor, eyes PANNING FROM elevator to the stairwell
M	HANS	Mr. Mystery Guest. Are you still there?
F	MCCLANE	I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
M	HANS	I'm afraid not. But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child. Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
F	MCCLANE	Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.
M	HANS	Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
F	MCCLANE	Yipee-yi-yea...mother-fucker.
M	KARL	He wasn't lying about Marco: He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs. And his bag is missing.
M	HANS	He had the detonators! Theo? Theo!
M	THEO	Yo!
M	HANS	We may have some problems. How is your schedule? and #2 DISABLED.
M	THEO	Three down, four to go --
M	HANS	Then don't waste time talking to me.
M	POWELL'S VOICE	This is Sergeant Al Powell of the Los Angeles Police Department. If the person who radioed for help on this channel can hear me, acknowledge this transmission...I say again...
F	MCCLANE	I read you, Powell. You the guy in the car? your eyes.
M	POWELL	What's left of him. Can you identify yourself?
F	MCCLANE	Maybe later. Just listen fast because this is a party line and the neighbors are trigger happy. Now here's the skinny: There's thirty or so hostages on the 30th floor, with probably 2 or 3 guards to cover a group that size. The leader here is named Hans, and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with, * they got machine guns and * sidearms up the yin yang. On top of that one of 'em had a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit Kate Smith. *
M	FRANCO	We have to find him and shut him up! He's telling them everything --
M	HANS	The police are irrelevant. We've * waiting for the FBI. Until they * arrive, we can't finish out work. Meanwhile, let this fool waste time for the police. Fritz, go help Uli * find the bag.
M	HANS	We must find those detonators.
M	POWELL'S VOICE	How many are there?
F	MCCLANE	Figuring there's at least one to cover the lobby, a couple with the hostages...I'd say they came in with about a dozen...but they're down to nine now, including the skydiver you already met. These guys are mostly Europeans, judging by their clothing labels, and they're well financed and very slick.
M	POWELL	How do you know?
F	MCCLANE	I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune. Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
M	POWELL	I hear you... Partner. And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
F	MCCLANE	I'm ahead of you...partner.
M	POWELL	Uh, what do I call you?
F	MCCLANE	'Roy'.
M	POWELL	Got it...'Roy'. Now listen. If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job. Understand? They're all yours, Al. Good luck.
M	ROBINSON	Who's talking to them?
M	POWELL	I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
M	ROBINSON	Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you learned? What do they want?
M	POWELL	The terrorists? Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
M	ROBINSON	Then who the hell have you been talking too?
M	POWELL	We don't exactly know, Sir. He won't give us him name. He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
M	ROBINSON	He claims? Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
M	POWELL	I don't think so, Sir. In fact... I think he's a cop. Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
M	ROBINSON	How do you know?
M	POWELL	A hunch. Things he said. Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
M	ROBINSON	-- recognizing phony ID's? Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
M	ROBINSON	Oh shit...
F	HOLLY	I...have a request.
M	HANS	Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
F	HOLLY	You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab. I don't enjoy being this close to you.
M	HANS	Go on.
F	HOLLY	We have a pregnant woman out there -- -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good. I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
M	HANS	No. But I'll have a sofa brought out to you. Good enough?
F	HOLLY	Good enough. And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
M	HANS	Yes, you're right. It will be done.
M	HANS	Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
F	HOLLY	Gennero. Miss Gennero.
F	THORNBURG	This is Richard Thornburg, speaking to you live from Century City... where Los Angeles has joined the sad but world wide fraternity whose only membership requirement is the awesome spectre of International Terrorism...
M	ARGYLE	What else is new...?
M	ARGYLE	Holy shit...
F	THORNBURG	We're told that the situation began some two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building and sealed off all of its entrances and exits...
F	THORNBURG	Since all the telephone lines have been cut, the only contact with the building had been through the use of CB communicators which the terrorists brought with them. Strangely enough, so far the terrorists have not communicated directly with the police... but an unidentified man has had several conversations which seem to indicate...
M	POWELL	What's going on?
M	ROBINSON	What's it look like? We're going in.
M	POWELL	Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
M	ROBINSON	-- all we know? We don't know shit, Powell. If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom? If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands? All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
M	POWELL	What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
M	ROBINSON	Who the hell knows? Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
M	MITCHELL	Chief, we're ready.
M	ROBINSON	I'm coming.
M	MITCHELL	Rivers.
M	RIVERS	Yo.
M	MITCHELL	Begin your reconnoiter.
F	MCCLANE	Powell? Al, you still with me? What's going on? Al?
M	POWELL	I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy. Let's talk later, okay?
F	MCCLANE	Al, what's wrong? Did something -- -- Oh, God. You're coming in! That's it, isn't it? Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
M	POWELL	I said we'll talk later, Roy. If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
M	HANS	They'll be coming. Get ready. Theo, watch the screens. Be our eyes and ears. Wait until they're close.
M	RIVERS	We're in position.
M	MITCHELL	Go. "Singin' In The Rain."
M	THEO	It was the night before Xmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, expect for the four assholes coming in the rear in standard 2 X 2 cover formation.
F	MCCLANE	No...
M	ROBINSON	They're shooting at them
M	MITCHELL	It's panic fire...they can't see anything.
M	POWELL	They're shooting at the lights.
M	ROBINSON	They're going after the lights!
M	ROBINSON	Call them back.
M	MITCHELL	No, they're almost in.
M	HANS	Don't get impatient. Just wound them.
M	MITCHELL	Send in the car!
M	THEO	Well, what have we here. The police've got themselves an R.V. James, Alexander, southeast corner. for use.
M	ALEXANDER	I have them Fire. front legs have been shot out from under it -- its front axle
M	HANS	Hit it again.
F	MCCLANE	Hans, you motherfucker, you've made your point. Let them pull back!
M	HANS' VOICE	Thank you Mr. Cowboy, I'll take it under advisement. His it again.
M	MITCHELL	Rivers! Rodriguiz!...Report...
M	RIVERS	This is Rivers. We've got one dead. Everybody's hit. Rodriguiz's bleeding bad. We've got to get the fuck out of here!
M	MITCHELL	Rivers, hang on! That's an order! Hang on, we'll get you out.
F	MCCLANE	Geronimo...motherfuckers.
M	WILLIAM	Oh, Jesus...
F	THORNBURG	Unreal. Did you get all that?
M	CAMERAMAN	Yep.
F	THORNBURG	Eat your heart out, Channel Four.
M	FRANCO	They're using artillery on us -- !
M	HANS	You idiot, it's not the police... ...It's him.
F	MCCLANE	Al! Al, the guys in the car, did they make it?
M	POWELL	Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
F	MCCLANE	The plastique I found. Is the building on fire?
M	POWELL	No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors. One spotters say you got two with that blast.
F	MCCLANE	Two? Are you sure?
M	ROBINSON	Is that him?
M	POWELL	Yessir.
M	ROBINSON	Give me that. Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
F	MCCLANE	Glass, my ass! Who the fuck is this?
M	ROBINSON	This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson, and I'm in charge of this situation.
F	MCCLANE	Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein. Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass.
M	ROBINSON	Listen asshole -- !
F	MCCLANE	Asshole? I'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national TV, Dwayne! Now if you're not part of the solution, stop being part of the problem! Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on!
M	ARGYLE	Tell 'em, Mr. Mac! Tell 'em!
M	POWELL'S VOICE	Hello, Roy. How're you feeling?
F	MCCLANE	Pretty fucking unappreciated.
M	POWELL	Hey, I love you. So do a lot of the guys. So hang in there, man. Hang in there.
F	MCCLANE	Thanks...partner.
F	GAIL	...of the Nakatomi building, sources say that the terrorist leader 'Hans' may be this man, Hans Gruber.
F	GAIL	A member of the radical West German Volksfrei movement. Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago stating that Gruber has been expelled from the organization and is operating on his own.
M	HARVEY	Obviously, Gail whatever his affiliation, it's safe to say that Gruber's terrorist actions in Los Angeles tonight are well, terroristic...
F	HOLLY	Where are you going?
M	ELLIS	I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. Hi there.
F	HOLLY	What are you going to do?
M	ELLIS	Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast. I can handle these clowns. I want to talk to Hans. Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
M	KARL	-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
M	HANS	If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
M	KARL	I don't want neutral...I want dead --
M	ELLIS	Hope I'm not interrupting...?
M	HANS	What does he want?
M	ELLIS	It's not what I want, it's what I can give you. Look, let's be straight, okay? It's obvious you're not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses, am I right?
M	HANS	You're very perceptive.
M	ELLIS	Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something. Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business. I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
M	HANS	You're amazing. You figured this all out already?
M	ELLIS	Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference? To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building. Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
M	HANS	I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
M	ELLIS	The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? I can give him to you.
M	POWELL	Roy! You all right?
F	MCCLANE	Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies. Yucck. What do they put in these things?
M	POWELL	'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
F	MCCLANE	You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
M	POWELL	Not yet, the wife in working on our first. You got any kids back on the ranch?
F	MCCLANE	Two. And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
M	POWELL	It's a date. You buy the ice cream.
M	HANS' VOICE	Touching, cowboy, touching. Or should I call you Mister McClane? Mister officer John McClane on the NYPD?
M	THORSON	Get on the phone to our New York affiliate...move, move!
F	MCCLANE	Sister Teresa in third grade called me Mr. McClane. My friends call me John Mac. You're neither...shithead.
M	HANS' VOICE	I have someone who wants to talk to you. A very special friend who was at the party with you tonight.
M	ELLIS' VOICE	Hello, John boy?
F	MCCLANE	Ellis?
M	ELLIS	John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
F	MCCLANE	Ellis, what have you told them?
M	ELLIS	I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
F	MCCLANE	Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
M	ELLIS	Tell me about it.
M	ELLIS	All right...John, listen to me... They want you to tell them where the detonators are. They know people are listening. They want the detonators of they're going to kill me.
M	ELLIS' VOICE	John, didn't you hear me?
F	MCCLANE	Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!
M	ELLIS	John, I think you could get with the program a little. The police are here now. It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt. Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
F	MCCLANE	Don't you think I know that! Put Hans on! Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
M	HANS	Good. Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life. You're not part of this equation. It's time to realize that.
M	ELLIS	What am I, a method actor? Hans, babe, put away the gun. This is radio, not television...
F	MCCLANE	That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him! I hate his fucking guts -- -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
M	ELLIS	John, how can you say that, after all these years--? John? John?
M	HANS	Hear that? Talk to me, where are my detonators. Where are they or shall I shoot another one? Sooner or later... ...I might get to someone you do care about.
F	MCCLANE	Go fuck yourself.
M	ROBINSON	Goddamn, didn't you hear him! He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
M	POWELL	Christ, can't you read between the lines! He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
M	ROBINSON	Maybe. And maybe they'd at least be talking to us! Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
M	POWELL	He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
M	ROBINSON	Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
M	POWELL	No Sir. You couldn't drag me away.
M	HANS' VOICE	Attention police. Attention police.
M	POWELL	This is --
M	ROBINSON	This is Deputy Chief Robinson. Who is this?
M	HANS	This is Hans Gruber. I assume you realize the futility of direct action against me. We have no wish for further loss of life.
M	ROBINSON	What do you wish for, Mister Gruber?
M	HANS	I have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys now it can rattle it for me.
M	HANS' VOICE	...The following people are to be released from their captors: In Northern Ireland, the seven members of the New Provo Front. In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec...
M	HANS	...in Sri Lanka, the nine members of the Asian Dawn movement...
M	KARL	'Asian Dawn Movement?'
M	HANS	I read about them in Time magazine. When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions. You have two hours to comply.
M	ROBINSON	Two hours? Are you insane? I can't authorize...hello? Hello?
M	KARL	Do you think they'll even try to do it?
M	HANS	Who cares? Theo. Are we on schedule?
M	THEO *	One more to go...then it's up to you.
M	THEO	And you better be right, because this one's going to take a miracle.
M	HANS *	It's Christmas, Theo, it's the time of miracles. So be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock. Karl...hunt the little shit down and get those detonators. KARL Franco is checking the explosives, Fritz is with him.
M	HANS	I'll check the explosives. You just get those detonators.
F	MCCLANE	Al? Al, you there?
M	POWELL	I'm here, cowboy.
F	MCCLANE	Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours? That doesn't even make any sense --
M	POWELL	Don't tell me, partner. I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
F	MCCLANE	The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
M	POWELL	In my youth, partner. In my youth.
F	GAIL	...author of... 'Hostage/Terrorist, Terrorist/Hostage, a Study in Duality.' Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect in the next few hours?
M	HASSELDORF	Well, Gail, by this time the hostages and their captors should be entering the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.
M	HARVEY	As in Helsinki, Sweden?
M	HASSELDORF	Uh...Finland. Basically, it's when the hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological transference and projection of dependency...
M	HASSELDORF	What can only be described as a strange sort of trust and bond develops...We've had situations where hostages have embraced their captors after their release and in one case even corresponded with them in prison...
M	ROBINSON	The...the FBI? Here? Now?
M	YOUNG COP	Yessir. Right over there.
M	POWELL	You want a breath mint?
M	BIG JOHNSON	I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
M	ROBINSON	Dwayne Robinson, LAPD. I'm in charge here.
M	BIG JOHNSON	Not any more.
F	MCCLANE	Lost?
M	HANS	--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
F	MCCLANE	Whoa, whoa, easy man. I won't hurt you. Who are you? What are you looking for?
M	HANS	A way up to the roof...I thought I could signal for help --
F	MCCLANE	Forget it. They got a guy up there. You want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey? You hear me?
M	HANS	You...you're an American?
F	MCCLANE	Only if New Jersey counts.
M	ROBINSON	We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five hostages, probably on the 30th floor... seven, maybe eight terrorists.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.
M	BIG JOHNSON	Thank you. We'll handle it from here. When we need to commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know.
M	POWELL	Aren't you forgetting something?
M	BIG JOHNSON	Such as...?
M	POWELL	John McClane! He's the man who gave us all the information we've got! He's the reason you're facing seven terrorists instead of twelve.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	He's inside? Who is he?
M	ROBINSON	He may be a cop...we're checking on that --
M	BIG JOHNSON	One of yours?
M	ROBINSON	No, sir.
M	BIG JOHNSON	If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
M	POWELL	T...that's the same Goddamn thing the terrorists said!
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	Really? That's one good thing. Sound like we're dealing with pros.
M	HANS	There was a party -- celebration -- all of a sudden they were there -- shooting -- threatening us --
F	MCCLANE	Relax, man...you smoke?
M	HANS	You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
F	MCCLANE	I'm a cop from New York.
M	HANS	New York...
F	MCCLANE	They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
F	MCCLANE	Better than being caught with your pants down, right? John McClane.
M	HANS	William Clay. Call me Bill.
F	MCCLANE	Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
M	HANS	One weekend I went to a combat ranch... You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint? Must sound pretty silly to you...
F	MCCLANE	Sounds better than nothing.
F	MCCLANE	Time for the real thing.
M	HANS	Karl! Franco! I'm on 33. Come quickly. Put down your gun and give me my detonators.
F	MCCLANE	Hans. Your Hans.
M	HANS	Put it down now.
F	MCCLANE	That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
M	HANS	I'm going to count to three...
F	MCCLANE	Yeah. Like you did with Takagi.
F	MCCLANE	You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.
M	HANS	You were saying. at: 273-I
M	HANS	The glass! Shoot the glass!
M	HANS	Smile, Karl. We are back in business.
M	HASSELDORF	...all depends on what we mean by "Terror.' If Clauswitz could say 'War is the last resort of Deplomacy,' couldn't we just as well say that terrorism has an equal claim to...
F	THORNBURG	You got something?
M	MARY	Just McClane's name, badge number, police record, vital statistics... ...And his family's address right here in L.A.
F	GINNY	That one look pissed, Ms. Gennero...
F	HOLLY	Thank God. He's still alive.
M	THEO	You better heat up that miracle * you were talking about. We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
M	HANS	outside are doing and I'll be right up.
M	POWELL	Roy? You still with us?
F	MCCLANE	Yeah. But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
M	POWELL	They boys'll be glad. We got a pool going on you.
F	MCCLANE	Yeah? What's the odds?
M	POWELL	You don't want to know. more carefully.
F	MCCLANE	Put me down for twenty anyway...I'm good for it...so, what got you off the street, Al? You liked lousy coffee, or what?
M	POWELL'S VOICE	I...realized I couldn't do what I had to anymore...at least not out there. I had an...accident.
F	MCCLANE	They way you drive, I can see why.
M	POWELL	I...I shot a kid.
M	POWELL	Eleven years ago. Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
F	MCCLANE	I...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
M	POWELL	Hey, you couldn't know.
F	MCCLANE	I still feel like shit.
M	POWELL	Then this won't matter. LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
M	THEO *	There's the city engineers...they're going into the street circuits...But who are these guys in the suits?
M	HANS	That's the FBI...ordering them to cut * the building's power. They're as regular as clockwork...or a time lock...
M	HANS	...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
M	THEO	When you're hot, you're hot.
M	GUY IN MANHOLE	We're spliced in down the line.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	Do it...now.
F	MCCLANE	Powell? What's going on?
M	POWELL	Ask the FBI. They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
M	KRISTOFF	Damn! It didn't go!
M	THEO	They're on the building circuit... it's too local.
M	HANS	Encourage them to be bolder.
M	THEO	The only thing left for them is the City Grid... ...They may not do it.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	Shit! Cut it again. Go wider.
M	ENGINEER	I can't go wider here... ...I'd have to call downtown have them take down one of the city grids...you're talking ten square block --
M	ROBINSON	-- ten blocks? Are you crazy? It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
M	BIG JOHNSON	We must shut down the building. Go wider --!
M	ENGINEER	I need authorization --
M	BIG JOHNSON	Authorization? How about the United States Fucking Government? Lose the grid or lose your job!
M	ENGINEER	Central. This is Walt, out at Nakatomi. I want you to shut down grid 212. No shit, it's my ass. Just shut it down now.
M	BIG JOHNSON	That should shake'em up. With all the power shut down, those bastards are probably scared shitless.
M	POWELL	What do we do now, arrest them for not paying their electric bill?
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	We let them sweat awhile. Then, when they're expecting helicopters... ...We give them helicopters...
M	BIG JOHNSON	Right up the ass. This is Johnson...no the other one. I want that air support ready to lift off in five minutes...Damn right fully armed. We're on our way. Attention in the building. unloading the racks and racks of bonds and transferring them to the black cases.
M	HANS	This is Hans...
M	BIG JOHNSON	This is Agent Johnson of the FBI. The State Department has arranged for the release of your comrades. The helicopters you requested are on the way.
M	HANS	I hear you, FBI. We'll be ready.
M	HANS	When they touch down and we blow the roof, they'll spend a month sifting through the bodies and rubble. By the time they figure out what went wrong... ...we'll be earning twenty percent like nice fat Capitalists.
M	BIG JOHNSON	By the time he figures out what hit him he'll be in a body bag.
M	MCCLANE'S VOICE	Powell, listen...
M	POWELL	I'm here, John.
F	MCCLANE	Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me. Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry. You get all that?
M	POWELL	I got it. But you can tell her yourself. Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
F	MCCLANE	I hope so. But that's up to the guy upstairs. Upstairs... ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
M	POWELL	Roy?
F	MCCLANE	Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something out.
F	THORNBURG	One minute, that's all we ask. You could be denying them their last chance to talk to their parents.
F	PAULINA	I'm sorry...Mrs. Holly says I couldn't let strangers into --
F	THORNBURG	Strangers? I'm with KFLW TV, that's affiliated with the FCC, and I'm sure you know that's the United States government...just like the INS?
F	MCCLANE	I was here...he was...
F	MCCLANE	Oh my God...
F	MCCLANE	Powell! Powell, listen to me! You're being double crossed! The whole roof of this building is --
M	POWELL	Roy? Hello? Hello? I thought you had him.
M	OFFICER	I did. He said something about a, a double cross...
M	POWELL	Tell me about it.
M	KARL	We're both professionals. But this is personal. You...are done.
M	EDDIE	They're coming.
M	THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV	-- I know you're proud of your daddy...
F	THORNBURG	...because he's a very brave policeman. And your mom has shown just as much courage. But is there something you would like to say to them if they're watching?
F	LUCY	Come home.
M	HANS	Mrs. McClane. How nice to make your acquaintance.
M	HANS	On your feet, everyone! Upstairs, now! You'll lock them up there and come right down...
F	MCCLANE	Better this way, isn't it? I mean, any faggot can shoot a gun. does charge, it's unexpected.
F	MCCLANE	You should've heard your brother scream when I broke his fucking neck...
M	BIG JOHNSON	Stay low. They're expecting transports, not gunships.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	What do you figure on breakage?
M	BIG JOHNSON	I figure we take out all the terrorists, and lose 20 percent of the hostages... 25, tops.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	I can live with those numbers.
M	HANS	A little bonus for us. A policeman's wife might come in handy.
M	HANS	McClane! McClane! I have some news for you...McClane?
M	HANS	McClane? Karl? Karl?
M	HANS	Hurry.
F	HOLLY	After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
M	HANS	I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
M	BIG JOHNSON	Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?
M	PILOT	My kind of town.
F	MCCLANE	Where's Holly --
F	GINNY	The took her -- after they saw the kids on television --
F	MCCLANE	What? God --
F	MCCLANE	Listen to me! All of you, get down to the lower floors -- you're all in danger.
M	HOSTAGE	What are you, crazy? We're being rescued! Those helicopters --
F	MCCLANE	-- there won't be shit for those helicopters to land on, because the whole top of this building is wired with explosives! Now get below --
M	SECOND HOSTAGE	But...we're safe up here --
F	MCCLANE	Safe, my ass! This ain't a helipad, it's a launching pad!
F	MCCLANE	GET BELOW! NOW!
M	YOUNG FBI	Flight leader, this is Wing. I think they're on to us. One of the terrorists is firing on the hostages.
M	LITTLE JOHNSON	Roger, Wing. We copy. Swing around. Give me a clear shot.
M	HANS	Schnell, schnell...der zeitz ist kurz...
M	BIG JOHNSON	Bank and we'll nail him!
M	HANS	Blow the roof. Now!
M	KRISTOFF	But Karl and Uli are up there --
F	MCCLANE	You assholes, I'm on your side -- !
F	MCCLANE	Fuck this...
F	MCCLANE	Shit...
