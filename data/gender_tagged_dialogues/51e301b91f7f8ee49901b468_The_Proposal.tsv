M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	RICHARD	Where are my clothes? A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers. SIMONE is the
M	SIMONE	In the kitchen. I think. Can I make you some coffee?
M	RICHARD	Sorry, I gotta go. I'm late. Richard hurries to the kitchen. Socks are on the butcher block Have you seen my belt? Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.
M	SIMONE	In here. She unties the complicated knot. Richard comes back half
M	RICHARD	Baby, I just can't do this anymore.
M	RICHARD	You're just too much for me. And I'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job.
M	SIMONE	Fine. Whatever. Just go. Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.
M	RICHARD	Let's not end it like that. It's been an amazing three and a half weeks. Thank you. And you should know that you have the nicest ass I've ever been with. You mean it?
M	RICHARD	I do. It's magnificent.
M	SIMONE	I work really hard on it.
M	RICHARD	I know you do. Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her I really gotta go.
F	MARGARET	I knew you would call! Now come on, tell me what I want to hear. Give it to me.
M	DOORMAN	You have to put it by your mouth so people can hear you.
F	MARGARET	You should get paid extra for being so darn funny. Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out This is Margaret.
M	JILLIAN	You're running late today.
M	RICHARD	Jillian, you are the best.
M	JILLIAN	If you think I'm good at this, you should use that coffee cup sometime. As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
M	RICHARD	See ya tomorrow. Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors. Inside the
M	CO-WORKER #1	How long is she gonna make us come in by seven?
M	RICHARD	She doesn't exactly consult with me on these things.
M	CO-WORKER #1	Well this sucks ass.
M	RICHARD	Welcome to my nightmare. The doors close as...
F	MARGARET	You've been thinking about our talk because I'm right. Everyone does publicity. Roth, McCourt, Russo. Hell, Chabon practically whores himself. Know what they have in common? A Pulitzer. Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty years, but that's how long it's been since you've written a book this good. At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
F	MARGARET	I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books, I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius piece of literature. Do the publicity. Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes." You're making the right decision! Great news. Going into an elevator, think I'm going to lose you... Margaret hangs up. Never give them a chance to change their
M	RECEPTIONIST	Good morning! Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.
M	RICHARD	You've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.
F	MARGARET	Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight, I got Frank to do publicity.
M	RICHARD	Nice job.
F	MARGARET	When I want your praise, I'll ask for it. Is Bob here?
M	RICHARD	I'm sure. You want him on the phone?
F	MARGARET	We're going to his office. Grab your pad. Richard calmly backs out of the office...
F	MARGARET	That's cute. You gonna call her today?
M	RICHARD	What? Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
F	MARGARET	Are you bored here? Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day?
M	RICHARD	Uh...
F	MARGARET	You have another late night out? Margaret starts walking. Richard quickly catches up, worried
F	MARGARET	I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.
M	RICHARD	Oh. Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.
F	MARGARET	You'll magically unwrinkle?
M	RICHARD	Yes.
F	MARGARET	You have magic pants?
M	RICHARD	No. I've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles.
F	MARGARET	Does this work on more than just your pants?
M	RICHARD	Anything that's wrinkled.
F	MARGARET	Buy me some.
M	RICHARD	Will do. Richard makes a note. Margaret stops to make her point.
F	MARGARET	I don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I will not have your personal life affect you at work. If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and professional. Got it?
M	RICHARD	Got it.
F	MARGARET	Great. Now you're just a prop in here, so don't say a word.
F	MARGARET	Hey, Bob.
M	BOB	Ah. Our fearless leader and her liege. Margaret smiles.
F	MARGARET	I'm lettin' you go, Bob.
M	BOB	Pardon?
F	MARGARET	You're fired.
M	BOB	What? What are you talking about?
F	MARGARET	This isn't working out.
M	BOB	You can't...
F	MARGARET	I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do publicity. You said it was impossible.
M	BOB	It is. He doesn't do publicity.
F	MARGARET	I just talked to him. He's in.
M	BOB	But...
F	MARGARET	No more buts, Bob. I've been chief for a month and a half, and this is the third time you've dropped the ball. You didn't even call to ask him.
F	MARGARET	All you had to do to was pick up the phone. That's it. Now I'll give you two months to find a new job, and then you can say you resigned. I won't tell a soul, my lips are sealed. Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.
F	MARGARET	What's he doing? Richard turns around and takes a peek. Bob gets out of his chair
M	RICHARD	He's up and about to pop.
F	MARGARET	Oh Bob, don't do it... The office stops. This is going to be good. Margaret turns
F	MARGARET	What are you doing? I gave you a civilized way out of this.
M	BOB	This is because I'm your competition. Because I threaten you!
F	MARGARET	Oh, Bob. You could never threaten me. I'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent. I'm firing you because you don't work hard. So if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk. Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass. Are we perfectly clear? Bob nods. Good. Now I've got work to do, so if you'll Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones. We need to call his authors and explain what happened. And get Frank's publicity schedule figured out pronto.
M	RICHARD	No problem. I'll just cancel my trip this weekend.
F	MARGARET	I gave you the weekend off?
M	RICHARD	It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday. But no big deal. You were right before, I need to stay focused. Professional.
M	RICHARD	Well tell gammy that I'm sorry. Mom, she's making me work this weekend. It's not like I volunteered. I'm sure dad is pissed. Margaret comes to Richard's desk. He tries to wrap it up. I have to go. Yeah. No, I'm not going to do that! No. Sorta. Mom! No. Bye. Richard hangs up the phone. Sorry about that. Damage control.
F	MARGARET	She tell you to quit?
M	RICHARD	No. No. Um. Yes? But as I've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is. Richard's phone rings and he picks it up. Your 10:55 is here. Mr. Gilbertson?
F	MARGARET	Who is this guy?
M	RICHARD	He said you knew each other. You weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting. We rescheduled on him four times.
F	MARGARET	Go get him. But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her office.
M	RICHARD	I'll charge up the cattle prod.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Margaret. Good to see you. I know how busy you are. Congrats on the promotion. Read about it in P-W.
F	MARGARET	Yeah. Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they? Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already. Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, Have to admit, I can't place where we know each other from. Gilbertson smiles. He didn't expect her to remember.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Three years ago? We worked together.
F	MARGARET	Don't have it...
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Remember "Dandelion's Desire?" Margaret gets excited.
F	MARGARET	Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me? That book is legend. Without a doubt the worst ever written.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You think?
F	MARGARET	It was a fever dream! 900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability. The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist? Oh! And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I believe there was a glossary... Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.
F	MARGARET	Did you see the pass letter I wrote him? "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do not confuse superior form with writing ability. Save your skills for the office newsletter, you sir, are no writer." A beat. Margaret says matter of fact...
F	MARGARET	You wrote the book.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I did.
F	MARGARET	You're Dante Dickens?
M	MR. GILBERTSON	One of my nom de plumes. Gilbertson paces. Margaret stays seated, at a loss.
F	MARGARET	I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you to Canada.
F	MARGARET	Excuse me? What? This is a mistake. I've lived here since 1981. I'm applying for citizenship.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You need citizenship now? After the big promotion?
F	MARGARET	Yes. And all the papers are in. Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Well, my office is going to reject your paperwork on Monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States. We must protect our sovereignty.
F	MARGARET	I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States?
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile, so you'll be deported while your case winds through the system. Will it affect you at work if you aren't allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two to three years?
F	MARGARET	"Affect me at work?" I'll lose my job!
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Ahhhh. That's a shame. Too bad we can't work something out. Margaret stops looking at her file. It all becomes clear.
F	MARGARET	Oh, no. No, no, no. I won't do it.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Do what, Ms. Mills? Gilbertson smiles. She's quick.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I've edited it down. It's better.
F	MARGARET	Well then, get it published at another house.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	They all just don't get me.
F	MARGARET	All?
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Well not all. Two hundred fifty, two hundred sixty-one. Ish.
F	MARGARET	I'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if I publish that book.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills. I'm an author. Not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his brother's garage. You're the last stop, and I'm desperate.
F	MARGARET	I will never publish your book. Ever.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	There's no need to make this difficult. I don't turn in your file until Monday...
F	MARGARET	This is blackmail. I'll go to your boss.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I've spent two years preparing for this day. Don't you think I've thought of that? Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
M	RICHARD	Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs you right away. The sight of Richard inspires Margaret. She turns to Gilbertson
F	MARGARET	Know what, Dante? I'm not going anywhere! We're getting married! Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.
M	RICHARD	Who's getting married?
F	MARGARET	We are!
M	RICHARD	You and him?
F	MARGARET	Stop playing around, honey. Margaret is all smiles. Richard is very confused. Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS. I told him about us. About us getting married.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You are marrying your male secretary?
M	RICHARD	Assistant.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You are marrying your male assistant?
F	MARGARET	We're in love. We tried to fight it. When it's right, it's right.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	And this has nothing to do with my visit here today?
F	MARGARET	Nope. True love. Got it bad.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You. Is this true? Are you marrying this... woman? Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.
F	MARGARET	Of course we are. Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer. Margaret squeezes Richard's hand hard.
M	RICHARD	Uh-huh. Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm I'm, uh, marrying my boss? Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine.
F	MARGARET	What?
M	MR. GILBERTSON	If I prove you're lying, you go to federal prison for five years. Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes. You. Do you know what you're getting yourself into? We're going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other. Do you even know her favorite color? Richard doesn't answer. Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
F	MARGARET	C'mon. Answer. You don't have a choice. Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.
M	RICHARD	Plum.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You mean purple?
M	RICHARD	No. Plum is "smokier" than purple.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Favorite flower?
M	RICHARD	Tulips. But only when they're in season.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Childhood pet name?
M	RICHARD	Miss Mittens.
F	MARGARET	Are we done here?
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Who knows you're getting married? Margaret interrupts.
F	MARGARET	No one. With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Have you at least told your family? My parents are dead!
M	MR. GILBERTSON	How convenient. So you're not telling anyone that you are getting married?
M	RICHARD	Nope. Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Pathetic. Four questions and I've got enough to send you to prison...
F	MARGARET	We're telling his family this weekend.
M	RICHARD	We are?
F	MARGARET	Yes. We are. We're surprising them... ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	And where's that going to be?
F	MARGARET	At Richard's parent's house.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	And where's that located?
F	MARGARET	In his hometown.
M	RICHARD	Sitka.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Is that on Long Island? Only Richard has the answer. Margaret tries to cover.
F	MARGARET	Why don't you tell him?
M	RICHARD	Alaska.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You're going to Alaska this weekend?
F	MARGARET	Yes. Of course we're going to Alaska. That's where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around. He's getting worked up.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You think you can beat me with this B-S story? Forcing your secretary...
M	RICHARD	Assistant.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	...assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend?
F	MARGARET	I'm sorry, Dante. Did you not prepare for that? Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence. Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his
M	MR. GILBERTSON	The INS will see you both in ten days for your official interview. Your stories better match up on every account. Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her Cross all your T's and dot your I's with this ruse, Ms. Mills.
F	MARGARET	There are no "T's" or "I's" in "Love" Mr. Gilbertson. Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard. Margaret goes back to Why are you from Alaska? Sweet Jesus, that's inconvenient. So here's what's going to happen. We'll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this INS interview. Richard doesn't react. Margaret doesn't notice. So you need to figure out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get my lawyer on the phone. Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face. But first, run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold. Margaret holds out her coffee cup. Richard doesn't move. Hello? Richard? Richard! Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.
M	RICHARD	I quit. Richard leaves Margaret's office. She still has her coffee cup
F	MARGARET	Richard, come back here. Margaret tries not to make a scene. Richard. Richard. Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception. Come back to the office! Richard can't take it. He gets up in Margaret's face.
M	RICHARD	You shut up. You just lost your "I get to tell Richard what to do" privileges.
F	MARGARET	Well, we need to talk.
M	RICHARD	You want to talk with me? Fine. Grab your broom and let's go. Margaret is dumbstruck. The receptionist is shocked. The Watch my phones!
M	RICHARD	Your plan is psychotic.
F	MARGARET	Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time. Sometimes you need to sack up.
M	RICHARD	Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?
F	MARGARET	You wanna be an editor? You need to make
M	RICHARD	OK. Fine. Then if we "make this happen"? You're promoting me to editor.
F	MARGARET	I'm doing what?
M	RICHARD	We go to Alaska and lie to my family? I risk going to jail? Well, you're making me editor for that. I mean, did you think I'd do this out of the kindness of my heart?
F	MARGARET	You work for me!
M	RICHARD	You know, during my employee orientation, the HR rep didn't mention anything about me marrying you.
F	MARGARET	Look, I came to this town alone and with nothing. I've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time? No way.
M	RICHARD	Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that sounds like your problem. Not mine. Margaret is stuck. Richard really does have the upper hand.
F	MARGARET	Fine. You take me to Alaska this weekend, and I'll make you editor. Deal? Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it. And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a- bed, we're staying in a hotel. Do they even have hotels in Alaska?
M	RICHARD	No. But they have huts. Teepees really. And you have to poop in a bucket. But otherwise, just like the Four Seasons. But with bears.
M	RICHARD	Um. Shouldn't we talk about what we're going to say to my parents? Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question.
F	MARGARET	Are you done with the press release?
M	RICHARD	Almost. Well let's finish big people business before mommy and daddy talk. Okay? Dejected, Richard goes back to work. Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES
F	MARGARET	So what do I need to know up there? Bullet points.
M	RICHARD	I told âem we've been dating for six months. We've kept it a secret from everyone... ...and that you're a naughty minx in the sack. Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate. Don't make me hate you. Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes
M	RICHARD	Bringing her home to meet my folks. She's Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass. I've got it here. Sorry. Guess I'm a little flustered too. Haven't been home for awhile, hope they like her! The gate attendant smiles.
M	GATE ATTENDANT	I don't care, sir. Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over.
M	RICHARD	OK then. You're a sweet lady. Thanks. Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.
F	MARGARET	I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at what I'm reading. It's just... I worked on that book.
M	HANDSOME MAN	You wrote it?
F	MARGARET	Edited it. It was one of my favorites.
M	HANDSOME MAN	Well you did a good job. It's great.
F	MARGARET	You don't see many guys with that book. You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines?
M	HANDSOME MAN	My ex-girlfriend gave it to me. I travel a lot for work. I'll read anything... Ex-girlfriend, huh?
M	HANDSOME MAN	OK, you got me. I'm a closet romantic. But let's keep that between us. Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion. Just
F	MARGARET	There you are. Give me my lap top. Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.
M	RICHARD	Hey, he's reading...
F	MARGARET	I know, Richard. Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead
M	HANDSOME MAN	Did you two want to sit together?
F	MARGARET	Sit together with who? The Handsome man nods at Richard.
M	HANDSOME MAN	Your boyfriend? Margaret points to Richard indignantly.
F	MARGARET	You mean him? The Handsome man nods. Margaret tries to set the record straight. No. No. No. He's my assistant.
M	HANDSOME MAN	You're bringing your assistant all the way to Alaska? Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer.
M	RICHARD	Oh, you can tell him the truth.
F	MARGARET	Well, he's... indispensable. The Handsome man isn't buying it. And gay. Takes care of me everywhere I go. Call him my queen mother. Aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother? Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look. He has to go along.
M	RICHARD	That's me. Richard turns to close the overhead compartment.
M	HANDSOME MAN	You're awfully nice to fly him first class. Margaret nods her head and agrees. It sucks to be Richard. left the house. GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits. She's lived a long time and When they see Richard, they SCREAM. Margaret's face drops.
M	ALL	There he is!!! Where's Margaret? Richard blanches white. Margaret looks back with eyes that say "What the hell is going on?"
M	HANDSOME MAN	That's sweet. Richard goes over to the group. Margaret keeps walking.
M	RICHARD	What are you guys doing here? What's with the sign?
M	DEBBIE	So you're "just dating," huh? I can't believe you didn't tell us!
M	RICHARD	Didn't tell you what?
F	ANNIE	We're not saying anything until you let us meet Margaret. Now, where's our girl? Richard looks around. Margaret keeps her head down and tries to
M	RICHARD	Uh. Margaret? You need to come over here. Like now. Honey. The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for
F	MARGARET	I have to go now.
M	HANDSOME MAN	What kind of sick shit is this? Margaret nods. This would be a tough one to explain.
F	MARGARET	Have a great life. Margaret walks toward the group. Richard puts out his hand and
M	RICHARD	Everyone, this is Margaret.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	It's nice to meet you. Now, do you prefer being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady? We've heard it both ways. Everyone laughs.
M	DEBBIE	Annnie!
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	It's not like he hasn't told her that he used to call her the Dragon Lady. They're getting married.
M	RICHARD	Now, ah, where did you hear that? The whole "getting married" thing?
M	DEBBIE	Oh, that man from the government. Gilber- something. Said he was checking up on you two. Said it was technicality, because Margaret was from Canada.
M	RICHARD	What, ah, did you tell him?
M	DEBBIE	Well for one thing, that you were in a lot of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married!
M	RICHARD	No. Really. What did you say?
M	DEBBIE	Just that you were coming up here this weekend. That we hadn't seen you in a while, and that we'd heard about Margaret for years, but that we'd never met her. Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands. The way that Richard talked about you? I'll admit, I didn't see this coming.
F	MARGARET	Me neither. Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the
M	DEBBIE	So why all the silly secrecy?
M	RICHARD	It wasn't a secret. We didn't tell anyone.
M	DEBBIE	Well, is your family just anyone?
M	RICHARD	No, I didn't mean...
M	DEBBIE	I should be mad at you two. But, but... I'm just so excited!
F	MARGARET	Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Oh, we cancelled your reservation. You're part of the family now. Family doesn't stay at a hotel. Also, we've got another little surprise for you two.
F	MARGARET	Surprise? Another surprise?
M	RICHARD	She's not good with surprises.
F	MARGARET	I'm really not good with surprises. Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other.
M	DEBBIE	Well you two...
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	...you're getting married this weekend!
M	MARGARET RICHARD	What? What? The whole kit and caboodle. Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you talking about?"
M	DEBBIE	When Gilber-something told us you were getting married...
M	DEBBIE	...God rest their souls...
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	...or friends...
M	DEBBIE	...we decided to give you a wedding.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Engagement party tonight...
M	DEBBIE	...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight. Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.
F	MARGARET	Are you witches?
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Just quaint. During the solstice it's good luck. It's an Alaskan thing.
M	DEBBIE	We've planned everything. Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	I'm old, Margaret. I don't have much time left. Richard lives so far away, and I never see him. Now I find out he's getting married, and I have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day. It's a dream come true for me. A dream come true. Please let me see Richard get married before I die. Please. Long beat. Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say. Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out The Dragon Lady!? Richard shrugs.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday. Just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding. Margaret stares at Richard.
F	MARGARET	I'm a lucky woman. Margaret does her best to smile.
F	MARGARET	I'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going.
M	RICHARD	Come on, it'll be OK. I promise. Richard points to a small island about a mile away.
F	MARGARET	Who are you people? Richard lets Margaret wonder. Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear
M	GEOFFREY	So you must be Margaret. We've heard a lot about you. All of it bad. Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he was marrying the devil woman.
F	MARGARET	I thought it was the dragon lady?
M	GEOFFREY	Either way.
M	RICHARD	Hey dad. Richard shakes his father's hand. It's a little stiff.
M	GEOFFREY	Welcome home. Good to see âya.
M	RICHARD	You too.
M	GEOFFREY	Been a while.
M	RICHARD	Yeah. You'd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion. Grandma Annie interrupts.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Help him with the bags Geoffrey. Let's get you two settled. As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
M	DEBBIE	We'll show you around later.
F	MARGARET	Uh huh. Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
M	DEBBIE	Balzac! Down! No! Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
F	MARGARET	What a great name. Balzac's "Lost Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.
M	DEBBIE	Oh. Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis. Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks No one on the island wanted him when he was born. We figured he deserved a home.
M	GEOFFREY	And don't let him outside, or the eagles will snatch him.
M	RICHARD	C'mon dad...
M	GEOFFREY	I mean it. They come out of that rehabilitation center mean. And hungry.
M	RICHARD	Don't listen to him, Margaret.
M	DEBBIE	You'll be sleeping here.
M	DEBBIE	Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the armoire by the bed. Just let me know if you
F	MARGARET	Thank you. Where's Richard's room?
M	DEBBIE	Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago. And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that you two haven't slept in the same bed before. Richard can sleep here too.
F	MARGARET	Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.
M	DEBBIE	It was her idea. Anything to help get her a great grandchild. Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.
F	MARGARET	Great. You know, I've gotten used to his breathing at night.
M	DEBBIE	I thought so dear. Debbie leaves and shuts the door. Margaret reverts back to her
F	MARGARET	I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.
M	RICHARD	Calm down.
F	MARGARET	What is going on here?
M	RICHARD	Hell if I know.
F	MARGARET	You had no idea they knew about us getting married?
M	RICHARD	You think I'd bring you here if I did?
F	MARGARET	Well, we just gotta tell âem.
M	RICHARD	Tell âem what?
F	MARGARET	Tell âem the truth. About us.
M	RICHARD	Wrong answer. No way.
F	MARGARET	What do you mean no way? This is crazy.
M	RICHARD	No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.
F	MARGARET	Well I don't like this.
M	RICHARD	Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony! For one second could you not be so selfish?
F	MARGARET	Selfish?
M	RICHARD	Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day?
F	MARGARET	How is it selfish to tell the truth?
M	RICHARD	Look. We're awful, awful people. In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone. We need to protect the people downstairs. We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. Let's keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.
F	MARGARET	Fine. But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me.
M	RICHARD	What've I lied to you about?
F	MARGARET	Why did you tell me that you were poor?
M	RICHARD	I never said that.
F	MARGARET	Well, you never told me you were rich.
M	RICHARD	When does that come up?
F	MARGARET	I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."
M	RICHARD	Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew.
F	MARGARET	No I wouldn't.
M	RICHARD	Come on! You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen. You're totally anti- rich.
F	MARGARET	I'm not anti-rich.
M	RICHARD	Oh yes you are! And you know what makes it worse? You have money!
F	MARGARET	I earned...
M	RICHARD	...every penny I have. Blah, blah, blah. You need new material.
F	MARGARET	Hey. Watch it. You're still my assistant.
M	RICHARD	You were going to promote me anyway.
F	MARGARET	Sure of that?
M	RICHARD	Nope. Not at all. Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.
F	MARGARET	Well, come on. If we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show. Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy Like the house, the party is first class. Ice sculptures melt, Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
F	MARGARET	I went to Union college in upstate New York. It's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of. Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink. Lime?
M	RICHARD	Be right back. Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges. Geoffrey elbows Debbie in the side, "What was that?"
M	WELL WISHER #1	How long have you been with your company?
F	MARGARET	Since I graduated college. Richard comes back with the lime. Margaret takes it and doesn't
M	RICHARD	She's been there since she was nineteen.
M	GEOFFREY	Nineteen? Wow. That's how long?
F	MARGARET	Oh, who's counting... Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.
M	GEOFFREY	No. How many years is that? Exactly. Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.
F	MARGARET	Well, let me see. That would be sixteen or seventeen years. Exactly.
M	GEOFFREY	I was never good with big numbers. That makes you... thirty six now?
F	MARGARET	Just turned thirty seven. Born on May 20th. I'm a Taurus. Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile. I need some protein.
M	RICHARD	There's some salmon. Margaret shakes her head no. Crab? Margaret nods yes. Richard steps away to find a waiter.
M	GEOFFREY	Keep him on a short leash, huh? Does he roll over when you whistle? Debbie hits Geoffrey.
M	DEBBIE	He's just being a good host. Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow. For Geoffrey's
F	MARGARET	Thank you, honey. You're being so sweet. Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.
M	RICHARD	Uh, sure. Honey.
M	WELL WISHER #2	So you just got some big promotion?
F	MARGARET	I'm editor in chief, now. Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret. I'm so proud of my girl. From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Editor in chief? You're marrying up, Richard. Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26). She is
M	RICHARD	Gert!? Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and What are you? What are you doing here?
F	GERTRUDE	Your dad made me come.
M	RICHARD	From Chicago? Gertrude laughs. The group watches these two see each for the
F	GERTRUDE	No. I live here now.
M	RICHARD	You what?
F	GERTRUDE	I moved back about six months ago. I'm teaching second grade. At Baranof.
M	RICHARD	Did your husband move up here too?
F	GERTRUDE	Uh, no. I, ah, got divorced.
M	RICHARD	Oh my God. I'm sorry.
F	GERTRUDE	Me too. But hey, we're being rude, I wanna meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret. Hi, I'm Gertrude. But call me Gert.
F	MARGARET	You're a Gertrude?
F	GERTRUDE	A family name from hell.
F	MARGARET	I'm sure it's been a curse.
M	GEOFFREY	Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.
F	GERTRUDE	Oh Please. Ancient history.
M	GEOFFREY	Feels like yesterday to me.
F	GERTRUDE	So tell me everything. I hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight?
F	MARGARET	Not exactly...
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Now Richard, what I want to know is how you proposed. This grabs the group's full attention. Everyone loves to hear a
M	RICHARD	Well... Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude. Uh, uh, um, I...
M	GEOFFREY	Yeah. How did you pop the question? Richard is a deer in the headlights. This is getting ugly.
F	MARGARET	Can I tell this one, honey?
M	RICHARD	Uh. Sure.
F	MARGARET	I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday. Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run? Richard! So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, "shhhh." So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear. Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green. Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife. Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. I said yes. The group gives a collective "ahh". Grandma Annie takes both
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud. I love you Richy.
M	RICHARD	I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the couple. Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
M	GEOFFREY	So did this happen before or after the INS agent came sniffing around?
M	DEBBIE	What is wrong with you? I'm sorry Margaret. Margaret doesn't miss a beat.
F	MARGARET	Oh please. I'd wonder too. Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it. I'm so embarrassed.
M	DEBBIE	Don't be, dear. Geoffrey's just an ass. While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says "I've got this under control". The moment is interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE. He
M	RICHARD	Margaret Mill's phone. One second please. Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. It's our friend, Frank. Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.
F	MARGARET	Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
F	MARGARET	Don't be a cliche, Frank. Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him. The dog starts YAPPING Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts. Margaret walks away and puts the phone I fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind. Our job is to help you succeed. He wasn't doing that. Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone. Margaret WHOOSH! The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. Could you hold on just a second? With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone Sorry, dropped my phone. Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything. But know this. This book is your legacy... Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision. My-phone is- always-on. Talk-to-you-soon. The eagle bears down on them with talons out. Just as the eagle Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the Take the dog! Take the dog!
M	DEBBIE	Where's Margaret? We need to go.
M	RICHARD	Go where?
M	DEBBIE	It's a surprise. Girls are going into town. And the boys stay here. I told you, we've planned everything.
M	RICHARD	Um. She's outside. Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window.
M	DEBBIE	Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my Balzac.
F	MARGARET	This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle. C'mon, bring back the phone. Richard calls out from the house.
M	RICHARD	What are you doing?
F	MARGARET	The eagle took my phone!
M	RICHARD	Are you drunk?
F	MARGARET	Your dad was right! The eagle tried to take the dog, so I saved it, then it came back and took my phone.
M	RICHARD	Did the dingo eat your baby, too?
F	MARGARET	Frank's going to call me on that phone. I need it!
M	RICHARD	Relax. I've got your information backed up on the laptop. I'll just get you a new phone and switch the number. No problem.
F	MARGARET	Oh.
M	RICHARD	Now come on. You're going somewhere with my mom and the girls.
F	MARGARET	I'm not going anywhere.
M	RICHARD	You want a new phone? You're going.
M	DEBBIE	Work it Hank!
F	GERTRUDE	Is that a salmon down your pants? The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
F	MARGARET	Definitely not a salmon. The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
M	HANK	Ah, ah, ah. I was just the warm up. Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.
F	MARGARET	What's going on?
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Just sit there dear.
M	MC	Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often, show Hank how much you appreciate his assets! And now... Ramone! The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
F	MARGARET	What's that smell? Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about Ahhh!!! Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
M	RAMONE	You are a naughty devil. Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
F	MARGARET	Good lord.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Ramone was the only male dancer on the island for years. No one has the heart to tell him to hang it up.
F	MARGARET	Want me to do it?
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Thank you dear, but let's keep it our secret. Richard comes down from the house to join the group. Geoffrey
M	GEOFFREY	...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that dissolve in the water.
M	MAGUIRE	How does she come up with this shit?
M	GEOFFREY	She just does. I stopped trying to figure out how. Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way. Mr. I'm mad at you, son!
M	RICHARD	Why's that, Mr. Maguire?
M	MAGUIRE	You fly up here and don't call me?
M	RICHARD	Sorry âbout that.
M	MAGUIRE	What good is me owning an airline if I can't give you free tickets?
M	RICHARD	You're right. Don't know what I was thinking...
M	MAGUIRE	Damn, straight. Don't let it happen again! Here, you take over. This game is for pussies, I'm getting a drink. Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
M	GEOFFREY	Maguire's stepping down in January. He's, uh, handing things over to Matty. Richard gives his dad a look. He knows where this is going.
M	RICHARD	That's great for them.
M	GEOFFREY	So. How's work with you?
M	RICHARD	Good. Busy. You know.
M	GEOFFREY	I do. I do. Hey, did I tell you that we're opening a little office in Japan?
M	RICHARD	Congratulations.
M	GEOFFREY	We're not just a mom and pop operation anymore. We're going global.
M	RICHARD	Uh-huh. Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second. He's been
M	GEOFFREY	I could really use your help.
M	RICHARD	Dad. Please. I'm in New York. Margaret's in New York. We have jobs.
M	GEOFFREY	I know. I know. It's just... It's just what?
M	GEOFFREY	You're only a secretary. This pisses Richard off immediately.
M	RICHARD	Again with the secretary thing! I've told you, I'm an assistant!
M	GEOFFREY	Just because you call yourself an "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary.
M	RICHARD	Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would you want me up here anyway? Sounds like you're doing great without me.
M	GEOFFREY	It's not like that and you know it.
M	RICHARD	Then how is it? Explain it to me. Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.
M	GEOFFREY	Last week, a man stuck his finger up my butt...
M	RICHARD	This man was a doctor?
M	GEOFFREY	...and it got me thinking about you.
M	RICHARD	I'm not sure this is coming out right.
M	GEOFFREY	Just shut up for a second, okay? I want you to have what I built. But I'm running out of time to show you things.
M	RICHARD	Stop being so dramatic.
M	GEOFFREY	I'm not being... I need you to stop dicking around down there and get serious.
M	RICHARD	So this is all about what you want?
M	GEOFFREY	That's not what I said.
M	RICHARD	And me in New York with Margaret? That isn't serious?
M	GEOFFREY	One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the next day she's the love of your life? How is that serious?
M	RICHARD	Things change, dad. Things change?
M	RICHARD	Things change.
M	GEOFFREY	Things change?
M	RICHARD	Yes. Things change.
M	GEOFFREY	Things change. That's your explanation? Know what I think? I think you banged your boss and fell in love, that's what I think. Some sorta mommy complex.
M	RICHARD	Nice, dad. We gotta have these Cosby moments more often. This is great. Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.
F	GERTRUDE	They can be a little overwhelming, but they're great people.
F	MARGARET	What? I'm just working on my tan. It's been a long day. Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.
F	GERTRUDE	Around the solstice they don't watch the clock. Pretty much party âtil they fall over.
F	GERTRUDE	I actually missed it when I was in the states.
F	MARGARET	Chicago, right?
F	GERTRUDE	Yeah. Since college.
F	MARGARET	And now you're back?
F	GERTRUDE	Six months now. Call me crazy, but I love it. Think I'm back for good.
F	MARGARET	Really? I don't know. Don't you miss...
F	GERTRUDE	Neimans? Starbucks? Escalators? Margaret laughs. She likes this woman. Yeah. I miss it. Believe me, growing up I never thought I'd end up divorced and back here teaching at my old elementary school. That was always Richard's plan.
F	MARGARET	For you to get divorced?
F	GERTRUDE	No. I was going to teach, he was going to run his dad's business. He was like a little old man. Had it all worked out.
F	MARGARET	Are we talking about the same guy?
F	GERTRUDE	What do you mean?
F	MARGARET	Well, Richard's such a player. Gertrude looks confused. I mean he was a total player. Before we started dating. Six months ago.
F	MARGARET	That surprises you?
F	GERTRUDE	Did he ever tell you why we broke up?
F	MARGARET	We don't really talk much about stuff like that.
F	GERTRUDE	Oh. Well I should shut up...
F	MARGARET	No, no. Please. I mean, we are getting married. I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.
F	GERTRUDE	He proposed to me. When we were seniors. Margaret laughs.
F	MARGARET	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... He proposed to you in high school?
F	GERTRUDE	He bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee. It was so cute.
F	MARGARET	You must have...
F	GERTRUDE	... freaked out? Oh you bet. I broke up with him on the spot.
F	MARGARET	I would hope so.
F	GERTRUDE	After getting rejected the first time, I can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you. Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being so honest with her. Anyway. The idea that my little old man could be a player... It's just not the Richard I knew. Good thing you're making an honest man of him again. Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in Well I'm empty. I'm going to go get another. I think I hear Ramone wrapping up, let's get back to the girls.
F	MARGARET	I'll be right in. Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean. Gertrude goes inside. We are awful people. Richard! Honey! Is everything OK? With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear Annie shakes her head. Something is up.
M	GEOFFREY	Excuse me? I'm watching that.
F	ANNIE	Why is Richard chopping wood?
M	DEBBIE	And don't play dumb. What did you do? Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.
M	GEOFFREY	Nothing. I didn't do anything... will you please move. The showdown intensifies. Margaret excuses herself.
F	MARGARET	I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice. He's still mad. Think I'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night. Once
M	GEOFFREY	Stop looking at me like that! to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me." Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches
M	IN THE BEDROOM	Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "...I've been
M	IN THE BATHROOM	Margaret's ears perk up. The bathroom is a disaster because she
F	MARGARET	Richard, is that you?
M	IN THE BEDROOM	Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
M	IN THE BATHROOM	Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was. Richard
F	MARGARET	Richard, are you... Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
M	BALZAC	Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass. Her foot Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
M	IN THE BATHROOM	Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
F	MARGARET	I'm sorry bout the eagle. But I saved you. Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily. Margaret grabs Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
M	IN THE BATHROOM	Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
M	IN THE BEDROOM	Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.
M	IN THE BATHROOM	Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat. Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top. Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls WHAM! Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
M	MARGARET RICHARD	Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	MARGARET RICHARD	Why are you naked? Why are you wet?
M	MARGARET RICHARD	Don't look at me! You tackled me!
M	MARGARET RICHARD	It was the dog! You're blaming the dog again?
F	MARGARET	Will you just hand me a towel! Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked. When he looks You're flashing brain! Richard quickly changes positions. Out of desperation, he pulls You can cover up any time! Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by Explain yourself!
M	RICHARD	I didn't know you were home! I was outside chopping wood!
F	MARGARET	You didn't hear me?
M	RICHARD	I had my iPod on! Why did you jump me? Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.
F	MARGARET	I didn't jump you. I didn't mean to jump you. I didn't know you were here.
M	RICHARD	You didn't see me?
F	MARGARET	I was running from the dog! Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.
M	RICHARD	Wait. Were you tryin' to seduce me?
F	MARGARET	Oh please! Don't flatter yourself.
M	RICHARD	Mmm-Hmmm.
F	MARGARET	Go take a shower. You stink.
M	RICHARD	Fine. But don't come sneaking in there. You're still my boss. That'd be sexual harassment. Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door. Margaret takes There you go, buddy. Go on and play before she makes a coat out of you. Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom. Without Puppy hater.
M	LATER	Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find
F	MARGARET	I'm never gonna to get to sleep. Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down Oh. Well. Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed. The two
M	RICHARD	It was kinda weird seeing you naked.
F	MARGARET	Can we not talk about this?
M	RICHARD	I'm just saying. It was weird.
F	MARGARET	It wasn't weird.
M	RICHARD	How was that not weird?
F	MARGARET	Because we're... like teammates.
M	RICHARD	We're like teammates?
F	MARGARET	We are teammates. And teammates see each other naked in the locker room. All the time. It's not a big deal.
M	RICHARD	Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the bed?
F	MARGARET	Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in silence for another beat.
M	RICHARD	Margaret?
F	MARGARET	Yes?
M	RICHARD	Don't take this the wrong way.
F	MARGARET	Okay...
M	RICHARD	You're a very beautiful woman. Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.
F	MARGARET	Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.
M	GEOFFREY	Yes. Mr. Gilbertson? My name is Geoffrey Paxton... Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
F	MARGARET	Who is it? It's me dear. I made you two breakfast in bed. Can I come in? Uh, sure. Just a second. Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
M	RICHARD	What the... Your mother. Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
M	RICHARD	Come on in mom! Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee. Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.
M	DEBBIE	Well, it's your special day. Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on You two need your energy, so eat up. We've got your dress fitting, have to get the house ready, and then your wedding.
M	RICHARD	I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new phone.
M	DEBBIE	Will you pick up some champagne while you're there?
M	RICHARD	No problem.
M	DEBBIE	And don't be gone for too long. Lots of work to be done!
F	MARGARET	You don't have to go to all this trouble. Really. Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.
M	DEBBIE	Don't be silly. This is the biggest day of your life. You are coming into this family, and when it's family, it's no trouble. If your parents were with us, they would do the exact same. Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes. Richard Your mom is just so sweet. I haven't had someone make me breakfast in bed since I was a little kid. Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.
M	RICHARD	I wish she hadn't. I mean she almost caught us. Damn, that was close. Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
F	MARGARET	You just take all this for granted? Your family, this house... Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.
M	RICHARD	I'm sorry, what? You gotta try these. Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.
F	MARGARET	Why are you doing this to them?
M	RICHARD	Huh?
F	MARGARET	Why am I here? You didn't have to bring me here.
M	RICHARD	You made me bring you here! You told me I
F	MARGARET	I didn't make you do anything. You could of said no.
M	RICHARD	And what? Start over at the bottom again? No way.
F	MARGARET	I get why a not rich person would do this. But you've got everything. It doesn't make any sense.
M	RICHARD	Know what? This is none of your business.
F	MARGARET	I wish it wasn't my business. But unfortunately, it has become my business, because I made a deal with someone I thought I could trust. Richard stares at Margaret for a beat. He's exasperated.
M	RICHARD	You wanna know why you're here? I'll show you why you're here.
F	MARGARET	Fine.
M	RICHARD	We leave in a half hour.
F	MARGARET	I'll be ready in 20 minutes. Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it These are really good. She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves. Richard and Margaret walk down the pier. He points to the SEALS
M	BEK BEK	Hey, Richard! That the lucky lady?
M	RICHARD	Yes sir, it is!
M	BEK BEK	You look much younger than everyone says.
F	MARGARET	That's great to hear.
M	RICHARD	See ya on the line, Bek Bek.
M	RICHARD	Put this on. I'll meet you outside.
F	MARGARET	But I don't...
M	RICHARD	Ah. Put it on.
F	MARGARET	Is this really necessary?
M	RICHARD	You'll thank me later. Richard walks towards the warehouse. Margaret follows in her At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
F	MARGARET	Why is he handcuffed to the machine?
M	RICHARD	So his hands don't go too far. So he doesn't... Richard makes a chopping motion. Margaret winces.
F	MARGARET	Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where You know, I shouldn't be here. I was a vegetarian for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long There he is! Big city boy come to show us how its done.
M	RICHARD	Ah, it's been a while.
M	WORKER	C'mon. Show her how we do it.
M	RICHARD	Okay, okay. Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line. Richard expertly You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don't want to bruise it. Open her up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish. Two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine. Margaret looks nauseous. Richard enjoys her discomfort. Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the blood out of the vein. Then send her down the line. Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before Wanna try it? Margaret doesn't say anything. All the other workers watch. If it's too gross for you...
F	MARGARET	Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
M	RICHARD	I did this for five summers. Dad wanted me to earn my stripes before I took over.
F	MARGARET	Is that why you're still pissed at him?
M	RICHARD	Nah, I loved it here.
F	MARGARET	You loved this?
M	RICHARD	The slime line? Hell no. Nobody loves the slime line. I loved this place. The people. Growing up, running this place was all I wanted. Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish. You wanted this?
M	RICHARD	I wanted to run this place. It was comfortable here. It was what I knew. Don't forget the spine.
F	MARGARET	I wasn't gonna forget. Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
M	RICHARD	But then things changed. And it wasn't so comfortable anymore.
F	MARGARET	What kind of things changed?
M	RICHARD	Stuff.
F	MARGARET	You mean, like, Gertrude?
M	RICHARD	Yeah... Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something. Oh my god. She told you didn't she? Told me what? Richard is embarrassed. He turns away.
M	RICHARD	About the... you know.
F	MARGARET	The creepy teenage proposal?
M	RICHARD	Ah, shit!
F	MARGARET	You were a freak by the way.
M	RICHARD	OK, get it all out.
F	MARGARET	And she was right to break up with you.
M	RICHARD	You done? Margaret nods yes. I know now that it was the right thing, but it screwed me up for a little while.
F	MARGARET	For a little while? Don't sell yourself short.
M	RICHARD	When Gert crushed my heart into little pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great anymore.
F	MARGARET	So you moved to the open arms of New York City?
M	RICHARD	At first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible, but then I fell in love with it.
F	MARGARET	With scheduling my pilates?
M	RICHARD	With editing. See, as an only kid I'd always read a lot, but until I worked for you I didn't love it. I mean, when I realized that we could find the next Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...
F	MARGARET	...To Kill a Mockingbird. It's all about To Kill a Mockingbird.
M	RICHARD	Exactly! We could find the next To Kill a Mockingbird. God damn, how great is that? Margaret smiles. She never knew that Richard had this kind of passion for the job. So when I tell my folks that I want to spend my life finding books? My dad goes ape shit. "How dare you forsake your family... you'll come crawling back to us... you're nothing without our help." I left that night and we didn't talk for a year. Haven't been back here since.
F	MARGARET	So we're "getting married" so you can give daddy the finger?
M	RICHARD	No. Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look. Sorta. OK, Yes. Coming back here with you... I get the promotion and I get to show off. You're editor in chief. You make a good prop. I guess that's a compliment.
M	RICHARD	So now you know I'm a petty asshole. Am I trustworthy again?
F	MARGARET	Oh yeah, we're good. By the way, you're more screwed up than I am, Paxton.
M	RICHARD	Yeah. Thanks.
F	MARGARET	One more question...
M	RICHARD	Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a lesbian.
F	MARGARET	That wasn't my question.
M	RICHARD	I know. Just lashing out. Margaret smiles.
F	MARGARET	Can we stop gutting fish? I need my phone.
M	RICHARD	Hey Ramone.
M	RAMONE	Hey Richard. Hola mi amo. Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night. Hey. They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word. You know him?
M	RICHARD	He was my shop teacher.
F	MARGARET	Of course he was. How many people are on this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.
M	RICHARD	Like eight thousand? Depends on the time of the year.
F	MARGARET	Feels smaller. With the cart full they head to the checkout.
M	RICHARD	You got the phone I called about?
M	RAMONE	Charged up, ready to go, number changed. Ramone throws Richard a phone.
M	RICHARD	Thanks, Ramone.
M	RAMONE	No problem. Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave. She awkwardly waves back.
F	MARGARET	Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?
M	RICHARD	It's our stuff. Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.
F	MARGARET	That must have been handy in High School.
M	RICHARD	You have no idea.
F	MARGARET	Should you leave the cart?
M	RICHARD	It's our cart. I didn't know you were such a prude.
F	MARGARET	I've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me.
M	RICHARD	I doubt it. When I started, you were still wearing those Ugg boot things.
F	MARGARET	I told you never to talk about that.
M	RICHARD	I'm just saying it's been a long time. I know it all. Margaret turns on her new phone. It searches for a signal.
F	MARGARET	Did you know I took disco lessons in the sixth grade?
M	RICHARD	Where?
F	MARGARET	The Y.
M	RICHARD	Margaret 1, Richard 0.
F	MARGARET	Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.
M	RICHARD	At Woodstock?
F	MARGARET	I won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair.
M	RICHARD	What'd they sing again?
F	MARGARET	You know. Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live... Richard shakes his head. Well they were good.
M	RICHARD	You had a lot of soul there, Canada.
F	MARGARET	I really like "The O.C.". Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny I like this trash. I really like it.
M	RICHARD	Wow. I'm getting shut out here.
F	MARGARET	Allergic to pine nuts.
M	RICHARD	Knew that.
F	MARGARET	Afraid of penguins.
M	RICHARD	Huh.
F	MARGARET	Haven't slept with a man in a year and a half.
M	RICHARD	Holy shit! You are a lesbian! A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty My bad. The mother walks on. Margaret is mortified and walks faster.
F	MARGARET	Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that gets a Holy shit? I've been busy!
M	RICHARD	That's a really long time.
F	MARGARET	That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.
M	RICHARD	I knew it had been slow going, but I figured there was a booty call in there somewhere.
F	MARGARET	Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.
M	RICHARD	I find that hard to believe.
F	MARGARET	No, not that. I'm great at that. Aces. Top notch.
M	RICHARD	I'll have to take your word for it.
F	MARGARET	Yes. You will.
M	RICHARD	How, exactly, do you define top notch? Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone. In
F	MARGARET	I need a computer and the internet. Now.
M	PIRATE	Aye lassie, welcome to the cyber seas. Our T-1 line is faster than a clipper ship in a hurricane, but for now ye be needing to scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet. Margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken.
F	MARGARET	No, no, no. I need on now. I've got a Booker prize winning author demanding I send him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house that "makes" him do publicity. The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.
M	PIRATE	Arrgh...
F	MARGARET	Listen to me asshole... The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.
M	PIRATE	Look lady. You gonna put your name down on the list or not? Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her
M	RICHARD	C'mon. I got an idea. Richard leads Margaret to the door. As they are leaving Margaret
F	MARGARET	I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in Alaska!
M	MRS. WHITING	I'm so excited about the wedding!
M	RICHARD	Thanks for letting us use your computer.
M	MRS. WHITING	No problem. So what flowers are you going with? Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her cool.
F	MARGARET	I'm sorry, but could I have a minute alone
M	MRS. WHITING	Oh. Sure.
M	RICHARD	Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting? It's been years.
M	MRS. WHITING	Do you think she'll be long? I've got work to do.
M	RICHARD	She'll be out of there in two shakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a
M	MRS. WHITING	We are so lucky to have her. Mr. Megher really left us shorthanded when he ran off in the middle of the school year. He's living out in the forest now with his wolves. Full time. Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said. He's hypnotized by Gertrude. She looks happy teaching these kids, and Will you excuse me? The bell is about to ring, I need to get ready for recess.
M	RICHARD	Uh, sure. Mrs. Whiting leaves. Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees
M	INSIDE THE CLASSROOM	The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door.
F	GERTRUDE	Class, this is my old friend Richard.
M	CLASS	Hi Richard!
F	GERTRUDE	Richard and I used to be in this very same classroom together. We even had your old teacher, Mr. Megher.
M	CHILD #1	Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs! The class giggles.
F	GERTRUDE	That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick. The BELL RINGS. One girl gets up. Gertrude eyeballs her. Marcia?
M	CHILD #2	Sorry. The child sits back down. Gertrude waits a beat.
F	GERTRUDE	OK, everyone is excused for recess. All the kids pop up and head to the door. Mrs. Whiting directs
M	RICHARD	Patrick's right. He did smell like eggs.
F	GERTRUDE	It's still not a nice thing to say. And actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog and... ...Matanuska Thunderfuck. But let's keep that between us. I give you my word as an editor and a friend... The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS. Five more minutes! Please! Margaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway. Sorry.
M	RICHARD	Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this after school for a week?
F	GERTRUDE	That was your fault.
M	RICHARD	Was not!
F	GERTRUDE	You tried to kiss me. A girl has to defend herself.
M	RICHARD	C'mon! I had the shot. I took it. Gertrude rolls her eyes. She's heard this a hundred times.
F	GERTRUDE	No Top Gun. Please.
M	RICHARD	What? You loved my Top Gun.
F	GERTRUDE	No. You loved your Top Gun. I just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend.
M	RICHARD	That's right. Ice... man. I am dangerous. Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise. Really. Stop.
M	RICHARD	That cuts deep. I'll have you know that Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down. Uh, is something wrong?
F	GERTRUDE	No. Nothing's wrong.
M	RICHARD	It's been awhile, but I can still tell when something's wrong with you. Gertrude doesn't want to say anything. What is it? You know I hate it when you get all quiet.
F	GERTRUDE	I wish there was a better way to say this.
M	RICHARD	Better way to say what?
F	GERTRUDE	I made a huge mistake. With you. Breaking up with you. I'm sorry.
M	RICHARD	Are you apologizing for high school?
F	GERTRUDE	Yes.
M	RICHARD	Oh, thank God. I thought this was like, something big.
F	GERTRUDE	This is something big.
M	RICHARD	I coulda used this about five years ago, but I'm all good now, promise. Thank you for saying that, though. Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point. She pulls
F	GERTRUDE	I think... I want you back.
F	GERTRUDE	Oh God, he's making me say it again. I want you back. Like... we should be together. All the time.
M	RICHARD	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rewind.
F	GERTRUDE	I know this isn't the best time to bring this up. My wedding day isn't the best time for you to bring up the idea of us dating? Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
F	GERTRUDE	I'm not talking about dating! You should move back here. We can have the life you always talked about in High School. I'm ready for that now.
M	RICHARD	Why are you doing this?
F	GERTRUDE	I know that the timing here sucks. But we are meant to be together. I know it. I think you know it too...
M	RICHARD	No, I don't. I don't know it. Richard begins to pace. Not sure what to say. Every time he opens his mouth, he can't find the words. Then, from the door, an interruption.
F	MARGARET	Hey guys. Holy shit. Did Margaret hear anything? Her face gives nothing
F	GERTRUDE	Oh. Hey Margaret.
M	RICHARD	Uh, you all done?
F	MARGARET	Yeah. We'll see what he says.
M	RICHARD	Great. Great.
F	MARGARET	You ready to get back to the house?
M	RICHARD	Uh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
F	MARGARET	Well let's go. See you at the wedding, Gertrude. Gertrude just smiles.
F	GERTRUDE	Yeah. See you at the wedding.
F	MARGARET	So, what did you and Gertrude talk about? Richard lies.
M	RICHARD	Nothing. About her school. The kids and stuff. Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head.
F	MARGARET	That was it? I was gone for awhile...
M	RICHARD	Yeah. That was it. You know, I can do this. You should really go try on the dress for my mom.
F	MARGARET	I was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since I got out, I'm feeling crazy.
M	RICHARD	Whatever. Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
F	MARGARET	What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT. She
M	SHAMAN	Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance. Margaret, welcome! She looks around. Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity. Come to me, Margaret of New York. Nope, that's her. She carefully steps out into the clearing. It is I, father Paxton. Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.
F	MARGARET	What, ah, are you doing?
M	GEOFFREY	My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and clear my head. As you know, things have been a little crazy around here. You should join me.
F	MARGARET	Ya know, I've got to get back.
M	GEOFFREY	You closed minded southerners amuse me. Never willing to leave the nest and try
F	MARGARET	I'm a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.
M	GEOFFREY	Dance with me! You besmirch my ways if you deny my circle. Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.
F	MARGARET	OK, OK. I "accept your circle." Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.
M	GEOFFREY	Clear your mind and follow me. Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body. Margaret
F	MARGARET	I'm gonna head back.
M	GEOFFREY	We're not done.
F	MARGARET	I think I am. Margaret begins to leave. Geoffrey calls after her.
M	GEOFFREY	Margaret? Margaret stops and turns around. I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot. But I'm making an effort here. Don't leave now. Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays. Geoffrey is pleased. Thank you. Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k... Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and ...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Geoffrey speeds up the dance. Now you.
F	MARGARET	Me what?
M	GEOFFREY	Chant.
F	MARGARET	Chant what?
M	GEOFFREY	Whatever comes out, just chant. It is the way. You'll feel better.
F	MARGARET	I can't...
M	GEOFFREY	Close your eyes. Chant. Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing. Margaret closes her eyes, Chant!
F	MARGARET	I don't know any chants!
M	GEOFFREY	Chant! Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
M	GEOFFREY	Chant! The drum beat continues. They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it. ...to the wall... More sand. More fire. ...to sweat drop down my balls... Geoffrey stops dancing. What did she say? ...to all these bitches crawl... Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken ...To all skee skee motherfucker... Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off. ...all skee skee got damn... From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.
M	DEBBIE	Geoffrey! Margaret stops chanting âLil John.
M	GEOFFREY	Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything. Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Is she singing about balls?
F	MARGARET	He told me I had to chant!
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Oh, you poor dear. Geoffrey, you can't do this! He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.
M	DEBBIE	He does this to keep in touch with "his people".
M	GEOFFREY	Don't make fun of my heritage! And it was helping. Don't you feel better? I feel better.
M	DEBBIE	Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned up. You've got a dress to try on. And Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and help us with this wedding. Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
M	GEOFFREY	Fine. With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.
M	DEBBIE	I am so excited. Aren't you excited?
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	This was my dress from 1929. My mother made it by hand. Amazing how things come back into style. How does it fit? Margaret speaks through the door. Just buttoning up here.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Drum roll! Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds. Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.
F	MARGARET	Yeah, it's a little snug.
M	DEBBIE	Come over here. Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror. Grandma Annie follows. It's a lovely dress. Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.
M	DEBBIE	You're so beautiful, and such a great match for my Richard. I know I've just met you, but a mother can tell. When he looks at you, I can tell he's in love. I'm so happy I get to share your day.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Debbie, please. We've got work to do.
M	DEBBIE	You're right. Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	You go work downstairs, I'll finish this. Debbie tries to calm down, but can't. Go! Debbie nods in agreement. Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in Had to get rid of her before I gave you this. Don't think she woulda recovered. Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around You needed something blue. It's silly, but I didn't want to take any chances.
F	MARGARET	It's beautiful.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	It's hematite. Alaska diamonds. The blue ones like this are very rare. My great grandfather gave it to my great grandmother when they were married. They were quite a scandal, you know. He was Russian and she was Tlingit. Back then, you had to get approval from every person in the tribe before you got married. It almost broke them up.
F	MARGARET	How'd they stay together?
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Don't know. But I'm sure happy they did, none of us would be here if they hadn't. Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror. I want you to have it. This is awful news for Margaret. She might as well be stealing
F	MARGARET	No, no, no. I can't. Really.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	I don't want to hear it. It's yours. Grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren. Makes us feel like we'll always be a part of your life, even after we're gone. Take it. Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time Are you feeling all right, dear? Margaret doesn't speak. Annie patiently waits for her reply.
F	MARGARET	Well. Thing is... Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't. ...the dress is just a little tight.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Oh, don't worry about that. We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk. We can fix this no problem. Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.
F	MARGARET	We need to talk.
M	RICHARD	I'm a little busy.
F	MARGARET	Well I'm freaking out. I need to get away from here. From everyone. Now.
M	RICHARD	Go for another run.
F	MARGARET	No! I did that. It did not help.
M	RICHARD	I'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping...
F	MARGARET	We're not going to need any of this if I don't get out of here.
M	RICHARD	OK, high maintenance. Let's go.
F	MARGARET	Move over, I'm driving. Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.
M	RICHARD	You don't know where we're going. Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.
F	MARGARET	It doesn't matter.
M	ON THE OPEN OCEAN	Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees, Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep Where are we?
M	RICHARD	The north pole. Congratulations, we made it. It's a glacier. Tracy's Arm. You better let me take it from here.
F	MARGARET	I'm fine.
M	RICHARD	Oh. OK. So like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields? And not died? Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer. Lady, you've got issues.
F	MARGARET	Yeah. I'm a control freak. Fine.
M	RICHARD	It doesn't stop there.
F	MARGARET	This coming from the sociopath.
M	RICHARD	Oh, please.
F	MARGARET	I'd never bring me here.
M	RICHARD	You drove!
F	MARGARET	I mean to Alaska.
M	RICHARD	Are you kidding me? Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.
F	MARGARET	You're sick. Doing this to them.
M	RICHARD	I explained to you...
F	MARGARET	They love you. Do you get that?
M	RICHARD	Of course.
F	MARGARET	And you're still willing to lie to them?
M	RICHARD	Like you didn't know.
F	MARGARET	Didn't know what?
M	RICHARD	That we were going to lie to them.
F	MARGARET	I didn't know!
M	RICHARD	Well that makes you either stupid, or ignorant.
F	MARGARET	You think I'm stupid?
M	RICHARD	No, but what's behind door number two... I forgot! OK? I forgot!
M	RICHARD	Forgot what?
F	MARGARET	What it was like!
M	RICHARD	What what was like?
F	MARGARET	To have a family! I forgot what it was like to have a family. I've been on my own since I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you breakfast, and give you necklaces... Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of I'm going to take a walk.
M	RICHARD	We need to head back...
F	MARGARET	Alone. I need alone time.
M	RICHARD	What? Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.
F	MARGARET	I'm, uh, about to lose my shit. Big time. I need a second.
M	RICHARD	But... Stop right there! Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put. I'm going to be over there. Away from you. Just sit down, turn around, and act like you're not here. Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
M	ON THE GLACIER	Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down. You can do this. Couple more hours, and then you'll never see these people again. Eventually you'll write a letter. Apologize. Send the necklace back.
M	RICHARD	Margaret!
F	MARGARET	No talking!
M	RICHARD	Watch your step, OK? It can be dangerous.
F	MARGARET	Again, you're not supposed to be... Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.
M	ON THE BOAT	Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
M	RICHARD	Margaret? Richard turns around and looks for Margaret. He doesn't see her. Margaret? I know I'm breaking "the rules" here, but where are you? He takes one more step before he hears... Richard!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!! Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her Oh, thank God! Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?
M	RICHARD	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just relax. I'll get you out of there. You've broken through an ice bridge. It happens all the time. No biggie.
F	MARGARET	Don't do that.
M	RICHARD	Don't do what?
F	MARGARET	The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they're going to be OK. Don't do that!
M	RICHARD	It's not like that. Really. We do need to be careful here though, I don't want us both to fall in. Stay still, OK?
F	MARGARET	Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now. He's checking the
M	RICHARD	So, I'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out. OK?
F	MARGARET	I'm really cold.
M	RICHARD	Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice.
F	MARGARET	
M	OK.	Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
M	RICHARD	So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits. I'm probably going to touch boob. But don't freak out. Margaret shakes her head yes. Richard reaches down and slowly When I get you all the way out, I need you to hold onto me. I'm going to carry you over there. Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard. He's I've, uh, never done that before.
F	MARGARET	You said it was "no biggie".
M	RICHARD	Yeah. Well. You OK?
F	MARGARET	Yeah. I'm fine. Richard smiles. Margaret smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms. She fits You shouldn't of laughed at me.
M	RICHARD	You woulda laughed at me.
F	MARGARET	Yeah. While I was getting my camera. The two stare at each other for a beat. There's a real spark.
M	RICHARD	Gertrude wants me back. Whoah. Not what she was expecting. She looks down.
F	MARGARET	And?
M	RICHARD	Well. It seemed like you were having... second thoughts.
F	MARGARET	Yeah. I was.
M	RICHARD	Maybe we should do it. Come clean.
F	MARGARET	Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down near the boat. She tries to regain You wanna call it off?
M	RICHARD	If you do.
F	MARGARET	Fine. It's over. We'll tell them when we get back.
M	ON THE BOAT	Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
M	GEOFFREY	Come with me.
M	RICHARD	Where's mom, dad? We all need to talk.
M	GEOFFREY	Not now. C'mon. Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
M	GEOFFREY	I haven't told your mother about any of this, and I don't plan to. I was really beginning to like you. Sorry about this. Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.
M	INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE	The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court. In the
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Hey there kids. Good to see ya!
M	RICHARD	What did you do? Geoffrey doesn't answer. He's not proud of himself. What did you do, dad?!
M	GEOFFREY	I called him yesterday. He told me that you were lying, and that he was going to catch you. That he was going to send you to prison.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	We made a deal and dad here flew me up. Now you tell the truth, and get off scott free. It's like it never happened for you.
M	RICHARD	You made a deal with him? On my behalf?
M	GEOFFREY	You were making a mistake...
M	RICHARD	That's none of your business.
F	MARGARET	It's fine.
M	RICHARD	The hell it is. It is not fine!
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Oh quack, quack, quack. Just tell me what really happened, and I'll be on my way. No one gets hurt, we all get what we want. Margaret takes Richard's hand.
F	MARGARET	It's OK. Tell him.
M	RICHARD	You do not get to make this decision. This is my decision. The truth is... I've been working for Margaret for three years. Six months ago we started dating. I recently asked her to marry me, and she said yes. See you both at
M	GEOFFREY	What are you doing, Richard?
M	RICHARD	Come on, we gotta get ready. Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.
M	RICHARD	What was I thinking? They act like they're nice, but really, they're evil.
F	MARGARET	He's only doing it because he loves you.
M	RICHARD	Are you defending him? Are you defending the king dick?
F	MARGARET	Just stop. Think about this.
M	RICHARD	Oh, I've thought about it. And know what I think? I think you saved my life. Thank you, Margaret. Getting married to you is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Without this, I might've ended up back here. Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.
M	DEBBIE	There you are! You two almost gave me a heart attack. C'mon, get dressed!
M	RICHARD	Coming mom! Time to sack up. Richard winks and goes inside. Margaret follows, not sure.
M	THE WEDDING MONTAGE	-- Chairs are set up outside. -- Guests arrive via boat. -- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo. Gertrude -- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches TV. He's not dressed -- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is perfect.
F	MARGARET	Matches the shoes. Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Those'll be your best friend. Wedding shoes stink. You ready? Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson. From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.
F	MARGARET	Nice song. Richard shrugs his shoulders.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	Is that your song, dear?
F	MARGARET	I guess so. Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle. Looking up,
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	It's me, Ramone. Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard. They
M	RICHARD	You look gorgeous. You look disgusting.
M	RICHARD	So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl?
F	MARGARET	Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits. Ramone. Mi amo. We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments. To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways... Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's ...of Richard and Margaret's true love... "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the ...before their family and friends. "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today. And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace. Gilbertson stays quiet. Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask. Mi amo, do you have a question? We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
F	MARGARET	No.
M	RAMONE	Then why is your hand up?
F	MARGARET	I have something to say. It's not a question though.
M	RAMONE	Can it wait âtil after?
F	MARGARET	Uh. Um. No.
M	RICHARD	What are you doing? Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd. They
F	MARGARET	Hey there, folks. Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the "wedding."
M	RICHARD	Don't do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.
F	MARGARET	Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me. This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air. I was going to get kicked out of the country -- so I told Richard that I would destroy his career if he didn't marry me.
M	RICHARD	Now wait...
F	MARGARET	Richard. Please. Let me finish. Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him. Don't blame him. This is all my fault. Could you get the band started? And give these people something to drink. And you. Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	You got it! Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
F	MARGARET	Take care of him.
F	GERTRUDE	Promise. Margaret walks back into the house. Alone.
F	MARGARET	Uh-huh. Yeah. That's great Frank. Good news. Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up.
M	RICHARD	So Frank's back in? Margaret nods distractedly. Getting Frank to do the publicity
F	MARGARET	Yup. He's in. For now.
M	RICHARD	Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird?
F	MARGARET	Yeah. Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags.
M	RICHARD	Great exit back there.
F	MARGARET	Thanks. Fun weekend.
M	RICHARD	Same old, same old, around here.
F	MARGARET	Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them.
M	RICHARD	I'll let her know. Why did you tell them all that?
F	MARGARET	It was getting too messy. We weren't going to be able to keep it up.
M	RICHARD	Don't start lying to me now. Margaret stops for a moment.
F	MARGARET	I heard you and Gertrude at the school. I think she meant what she said. She's a great girl, you should stay. It's the right thing. You're perfect for each other.
M	RICHARD	But... but what about you? What are you gonna do? Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.
F	MARGARET	Don't worry about me. I'll survive.
M	RICHARD	So what? This is it?
F	MARGARET	Yup. This is it. Margaret walks to the door, but stops. She turns to Richard. Have an amazing life, OK? You're a good person. You deserve it. She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it. It's electric, but Goodbye, Richard.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I want you to say the words.
F	MARGARET	I'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now?
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Say it. Margaret closes her eyes. Hating that it's come to this.
F	MARGARET	I'll publish your book. Gilbertson smiles.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Now was that so hard?
F	GERTRUDE	So here's the deal. I'm going to have a million questions for you tomorrow... Gertrude sits down next to Richard. ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here and drink beer. OK? Richard nods. Gertrude hands him a beer.
M	RICHARD	Thanks. Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek. Then, realizing
F	GERTRUDE	You have been practicing.
M	RICHARD	Waddya mean?
F	GERTRUDE	Well. Margaret told me that you, uh, turned into bit of a man whore down there. Richard looks down. A bit ashamed. Gertrude makes light. You're gonna have to put that in check if you move back. Cause me and Beth Cable are the only two real options up here... and I'll kick that bitch's ass. Richard gives her a polite smile. He's not really in the mood to So no jokes yet? Too soon?
M	RICHARD	I'm sorry. I'm just a little... confused.
F	GERTRUDE	That kiss didn't seem "confused." Richard takes a beat to collect himself.
M	RICHARD	You're amazing, Gert. And I've thought about being with you for a long time. A long time. When you said those things at the school? I've dreamed about hearing you say those things. But as crazy as this seems. I know now... that we're just not meant to be. Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched. Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret? I felt sick. For the three years we worked together, I wanted to be as far away from her as possible. But now that she's gone? I'm just really... sad. I want her with me. What is that? The question hangs in the air.
F	GERTRUDE	I don't know.
M	RICHARD	I think I have to find out.
F	GERTRUDE	Find out what?
M	RICHARD	If she feels the same way. Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.
F	GERTRUDE	Well. OK then. What's a girl gonna do? I guess you want who you want. Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.
M	RICHARD	I'm so sorry. But, I gotta go.
F	GERTRUDE	Uh-huh. Richard gets up.
M	RICHARD	Are you OK?
F	GERTRUDE	I'm fine. Really. Go. Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.
M	GEOFFREY	What are you so God damn happy about?
M	RICHARD	What? Oh. Well, I'm, uh, going to see Margaret.
M	GEOFFREY	What?!
M	DEBBIE	She violated you. We should report her.
M	RICHARD	Who you gonna report her to, mom?
M	DEBBIE	Oh my God. He's got the Stockholm syndrome.
M	RICHARD	I don't have the Stockholm syndrome. And she didn't violate me.
M	DEBBIE	What is going on, Richard? Richard slows down and explains to his mom.
M	RICHARD	I'm sorry I lied to you. That was an awful thing to do. But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me. I think she's... the one.
M	DEBBIE	But you already thought she was the one.
M	RICHARD	No, I didn't. Not until she left.
M	DEBBIE	Really? Does she think that too?
M	RICHARD	I don't know. I've got to get to the airport to find out. Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.
M	DEBBIE	He's going to stop her from leaving! At the airport!
M	RICHARD	But I gotta hurry. Her plane leaves any second. I might not make it.
M	DEBBIE	He's not sure he's going to make it!
M	GEOFFREY	Are you buying this horse shit?
M	DEBBIE	Oh, Geoffrey!
M	RICHARD	I don't have time to explain this to you.
M	GEOFFREY	Well then make some god-damn time. Cause I won't let you throw your life away for some woman.
M	RICHARD	I don't care.
M	GEOFFREY	Excuse me?
M	RICHARD	I don't care. I love you and want you to understand. But I'm not asking your permission here. I'm doing this.
M	GEOFFREY	Oh, really? From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.
F	ANNIE	Boys! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face. She
M	GEOFFREY	Mom, are you OK?
F	ANNIE	I'm having a... I need to go to the hospital. Fast.
M	HANDSOME MAN	Is this another gay assistant? Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat.
M	GEOFFREY	Richard! She has something she wants to say to us! Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie. Their three
F	ANNIE	Listen to me. You two need to stop fighting. You'll never see eye to eye, but you're family. If this doesn't stop, one day you'll regret it. Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if you don't agree with him.
M	GEOFFREY	I... I promise.
F	ANNIE	And Richard. Promise you'll work harder to be a part of this family.
M	RICHARD	I promise, Grandma.
F	ANNIE	OK, then. Annie closes her eyes. She looks peaceful. A moment passes. Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th I'm feeling much better. I don't need to go to the hospital. Take us to the airport, please. Richard and Geoffrey are confused. Stunned even.
M	GEOFFREY	What... what is going on? Did you fake a heart attack?
F	ANNIE	We didn't have time for your squabbling, and I knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport. It seemed like the best way.
M	RICHARD	The best way?
F	ANNIE	And remember, you two promised me that you're going get along. I wasn't kidding about that.
M	COAST GUARD PILOT	Ma'am, I'm not authorized to take you to the airport...
F	ANNIE	Larry Ferris! Don't make me call your mother!
M	MR. GILBERTSON	...I want my book launch to be special. I'm thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky Monastery. In St. Petersberg? Margaret stares at him blankly. Where Dostoyevsky is buried? Hello? I thought you were a professional... Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.
M	CHUCK	Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff.
M	PILOT (O.S.)	Roger that, Chuck. The PHONE RINGS in the tower. Chuck picks up. Intercut as
M	CHUCK	Tower. Talk to me.
M	RICHARD	Hey Chuck, it's Richard.
M	CHUCK	Hey man. Heard about your lady bailing. How often does this happen to you?
M	RICHARD	Need you to do me a solid, brother. I gotta see my girl and she's on that flight. Could you stop it for me?
M	CHUCK	No can do brohan. Need a good reason for the FAA holes. Lose my jobby job if I delivered that favor.
M	RICHARD	Oh, c'mon Chuck!
M	MR. GILBERTSON	...so next topic. Celebrities. Let's invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the Paris Hilton's, OK? Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane
M	RICHARD	Well. That's it. Once she gets back to New York, it'll be like this never happened. Richard looks defeated. Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
M	GEOFFREY	So, you know I think you shouldn't be with Margaret, right?
M	RICHARD	You've made that crystal clear.
M	GEOFFREY	Good. Well, consider this me keeping my promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button. He waits Hey! Maguire! Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something. But that's what I'm calling about. I've got a favor to ask you, âbout one of your planes...
M	MR. GILBERTSON	...you know those two hundred pages I took out? I'm going to put them back... A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Ms. Mills? Would you come with me? Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.
F	MARGARET	Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	What's this about?
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	There's someone on the radio for you. The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at Uh, a Richard Paxton? Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt.
F	MARGARET	Tell him I'm not here. I'm sorry. She won't come talk to you.
M	RICHARD	Shit! She's never going to pick up...
M	CHUCK	Know what, home slice? Cut this chica loose. You remember Beth Cable? She'd totally be into you... Suddenly, Richard has an idea. He picks up the hand mic.
M	RICHARD	Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor...
M	CAPTAIN	Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is your captain. We've reached our cruising altitude of 30,000 feet. Flight time'll be three hours and thirty minutes. And Margaret? Richard has something he'd like to say to you. Uh, hey Margaret. And cause I'm on the loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane. The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's This certainly isn't how I wanted to do this. I mean, I'm not really into the whole baring your soul in front of strangers thing, but I figure it's now or never. So here goes.
M	CHUCK	You're doing great, man. Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike.
M	RICHARD	I know you're used to being on your own. And that you're comfortable with your life the way it is. And that in a million years you wouldn't have thought that we should be together. I know, because I felt the exact same way. And you know what else I know? I know that I'm tired of being alone. And I think you're tired of being alone too. So come on. Talk to me. Please. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.
M	HANDSOME MAN	Do you really feel like you're alone?
F	MARGARET	Oh, good lord.
M	MARGARET (O.S.)	What the hell are you doing? Everyone in the tower smiles. They're making progress.
M	RICHARD	We need to talk.
F	MARGARET	About what?
M	RICHARD	Have you ever thought there might be a reason we've been together for the last three years?
F	MARGARET	As boss and assistant.
M	RICHARD	Things change, Margaret. Things change?
M	RICHARD	Yeah, things change.
F	MARGARET	Is that the best you got? Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said." Richard composes himself.
M	RICHARD	Now, tell me the truth. When you left, were you relieved or sad that we didn't have an excuse to be together anymore? Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up. That was a good one.
F	MARGARET	What's your point?
M	RICHARD	Because I am sick that you left. And if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together? Margaret goes to answer, but stops. Richard is right. She wants
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Are you thinking about going back to him? Margaret doesn't answer. We have a deal! You can't back out now! The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Sir, you need to sit down.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	I will do no such thing.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your seat. Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Who said that?
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Sir, this is your third and final warning!
M	MR. GILBERTSON	Listen sweetheart... I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get me another cocktail and mind your own... BUZZ! ZAP! 400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
M	HANDSOME MAN	Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall. And you're under arrest for disobeying a crew member, assault, and possible intoxication. The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need to get this unruly passenger off the plane ASAP. Sitka's the closest airport, so if it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain turn this bird around. There are wild cheers from the passengers. Margaret blushes. Told you I was a romantic.
F	MARGARET	This wasn't supposed to happen. Richard looks Margaret in the eye.
M	RICHARD	But it did. Margaret looks down. A little embarrassed.
F	MARGARET	I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved. Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.
M	HANDSOME MAN	Uh, sorry, but excuse us. The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
F	MARGARET	Hey! Do you think getting arrested might affect you at work? Gilbertson has no retort. Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish your book after all.
M	MR. GILBERTSON	So you are getting married this weekend? Absolutely not. But who knows? We might by the time you get out of jail. Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off. I've got some explaining to do. Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of Hi. I'm Margaret. I've known your son for years, but we've just recently begun to see each other romantically. I want to get to know you all, and spend some real time up here in Alaska. I'm not sure when you are going to see him get married, but I promise as long as I'm with him, he'll be happy. Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.
M	GRANDMA ANNIE	That's all we ever wanted. Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug. Debbie joins
M	The party is in full swing.	Balzac chases his balls. Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band. He has a beautiful voice. Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug. They've done this before. Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table. The Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink. Grandma Annie winks and leaves these two alone. Margaret and Richard dance. All smiles, even though they aren't And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
