M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CLAUDE	Here.
M	CLAUDE	Sorry.
F	MARGOT	That was quick.
M	CLAUDE	I sat next to the wrong person.
F	MARGOT	Really? Where? She stretches up and peers over the seats. He grabs her
M	CLAUDE	Please don't look. She'll see you.
F	MARGOT	Careful with my blouse.
M	CLAUDE	Will the wedding be crowded?
F	MARGOT	I don't know. I think she doesn't know anyone anymore.
M	CLAUDE	How long has she known Malcolm?
F	MARGOT	Only a year.
M	CLAUDE	Is that short?
F	MARGOT	Would you marry someone you'd only known a year?
M	CLAUDE	I'm not going to ever get married.
F	MARGOT	I can't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing.
M	CLAUDE	Why are we going then?
F	MARGOT	We're supporting her.
M	CLAUDE	I thought she wasn't speaking to you.
F	MARGOT	No...no...I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.
F	MARGOT	Why aren't you wearing your new shades?
M	CLAUDE	I don't think I need them right now.
F	MARGOT	You begged for those glasses.
M	CLAUDE	I know, but...I will wear them, I just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades. MARGOT That's ridiculous. Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk
F	MARGOT	You look very cool. He takes them off. I don't need them right now.
M	CLAUDE	Do they know we're here?
M	MALCOLM	Are you...?
M	MALCOLM	Paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house ready.
F	MARGOT	I'm sorry it was such short notice.
M	MALCOLM	I don't care. Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit. Oh, and Ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets.
F	INGRID	No, I wanted...I wanted to wait... MALCOLM Oh, I thought you asked me to tell them. Anyway...
M	MALCOLM	I got Knicks colors.
F	INGRID	They're not Knicks colors!
F	MARGOT	It's beautiful, Ingrid.
F	INGRID	I made this one for myself.
F	INGRID	Yours is yellow. Is that okay?
M	CLAUDE	I guess.
F	INGRID	Where's your dad and Josh?
M	CLAUDE	They might come later.
F	MARGOT	Josh's spring break is next week. Jim teaches through Friday and then they open the house in Vermont on the weekend.
M	MALCOLM	It means a lot to Pauline that you're here.
F	MARGOT	Oh. Good. car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near MALCOLM Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack! giggles. Margot clutches the handle above the door.
M	MALCOLM	If you're wondering about the moustache --
F	MARGOT	No, I wasn't.
M	MALCOLM	I had a full beard for a while and then when I shaved it I left this part for last, you know to see how it looked, and... It's meant to be funny.
F	PAULINE	You're so handsome.
F	PAULINE	I never thought I'd get you here. You're arriving in the midst of a drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is inside. Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans. INGRID It's the Voglers. The neighbors want us to cut down our tree.
F	MARGOT	No, that's our tree!
F	INGRID	They think it's sick and rotting their property.
F	PAULINE	We're having the ceremony under it.
F	MARGOT	You took the swing down.
M	MALCOLM	Pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends. I think they resent us because we're...
M	MALCOLM	I don't know what we are. INGRID This is my room. CLAUDE Okay. INGRID Do you like showers or baths?
M	CLAUDE	Showers. What about you?
F	INGRID	I don't care.
F	PAULINE	Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?
F	MARGOT	Well, I didn't know what to --
F	PAULINE	The moustache is temporary. He left it for last when he was shaving. It's meant to be funny.
F	MARGOT	He told me.
F	PAULINE	Yeah...
F	PAULINE	I'm sorry -- with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in Malcolm's storage room --
F	MARGOT	This was Becky's room. Poor Becky. PAULINE Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a storage room. I've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. You know? MARGOT Our parents.
F	PAULINE	Of course. It might still smell like paint, but...
F	MARGOT	I thought he was a musician.
F	PAULINE	Well, music's officially a hobby... He's painting now. And writing letters to newspapers and magazines. He's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart. I don't know. We're doing very well.
F	MARGOT	Good. I mean, you must be.
F	PAULINE	I don't know where to begin. What can I tell you? It seems I'm pregnant, but it's really early so... I haven't told anyone. I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.
F	MARGOT	Wow...
F	PAULINE	Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I hope so. Things are good. We did a couples seminar two months ago or so in Maine. They give you exercises and things to do. I know you're not convinced, but... MARGOT Mm hm. PAULINE We got engaged right afterwards. The guy who runs it, Strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which I'll lend you if you want.
F	MARGOT	Okay.
F	PAULINE	But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins.
F	MARGOT	I may not get to it for a while.
F	PAULINE	Well, I'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.
F	PAULINE	It's going to be very informal by the way. Just Mom and Becky. Malcolm's brother. Few friends. And now you and Claude. Nothing like the first one.
F	MARGOT	Becky's coming?
M	PAULINE/MARGOT	She isn't how you.../I'd really like...
F	PAULINE	You go.
F	MARGOT	I was going to say, "I'd really like some white wine."
F	PAULINE	Oh. Yeah. We have a... Well...I'm glad you changed your mind and came. I never heard from you after I sent the invite...I even wondered if you got it. MARGOT Well, I'm so pleased we're here. PAULINE Did you get it?
F	MARGOT	Yeah.
F	MARGOT	I'm sorry you were so angry...
F	PAULINE	I wasn't angry. I was...disappointed.
F	MARGOT	Uh huh. But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you down.
F	PAULINE	But you did in a way.
F	MARGOT	I don't see it like that.
F	PAULINE	Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?
F	MARGOT	Again, you're making me the aggressor.
F	PAULINE	You were the aggressor. Let's not... I've become a really good cook.
F	MARGOT	I can't believe you've still got all of our old records. Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the
F	INGRID	Mom, can you hide this please.
F	PAULINE	Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once?
M	MALCOLM	In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars.
M	CLAUDE	So, you're kind of famous.
M	MALCOLM	No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I used to want to be, but, No. Do you want to be famous?
F	MARGOT	Claude wants to be very famous.
M	MALCOLM	Well, make sure you can handle rejection. I can't. For me, expectation just turns to disappointment. So, ultimately I'd rather not try. It'll all go black for us soon enough anyway.
F	PAULINE	Claude, ignore him.
F	PAULINE	When your mother moved to New York she used to send me books and records. She sent me REM's Murmur... MARGOT And the Pixies.
F	PAULINE	And X. She was very cool your mother.
F	MARGOT	You only liked top forty.
F	PAULINE	Yeah, but I love REM now.
F	MARGOT	I don't really listen to music anymore.
F	PAULINE	I was dating that guy, Horace back then. Remember him?
F	MARGOT	Was that the guy who liked to rough you up?
F	PAULINE	No, that was our dad.
F	MARGOT	his skivvies and beat us with a belt.
M	MALCOLM	That man had a sexual screw loose.
F	PAULINE	It's awful -- that stuff that happens to kids. Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter. MALCOLM Just use that information however you want...
F	PAULINE	Sorry. We're with family. I figured... looks at Malcolm. Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.
F	PAULINE	I think Becky got it the worst.
F	MARGOT	Did she ever. Raped by the horse trainer...
M	TOBY	Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I can't feel my face. It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy.
M	ALAN	They say a brush of wind can do it.
M	TOBY	Feeling is slowly coming back.
M	MALCOLM	We're all getting older... Which is terrible -- I don't care how universal it is. I can't remember names anymore.
F	MARGOT	I have that. I blank out on certain words now too. Like the other day, I couldn't remember the word for... I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine. Sediment! That was it.
M	MALCOLM	I know that. I was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for Motley Cr√ºe. Malcolm lights up a cigarette. He offers one to Claude who
F	PAULINE	Ingrid, why don't you show Claude and Bruce the game trunk.
F	INGRID	Okay.
M	MALCOLM	Mick Mars.
F	MARGOT	Toby, I think you need to have Bruce diagnosed.
M	TOBY	Margot, I don't want to have this conversation with you.
F	MARGOT	It's vital. If you keep telling him he's like everyone else he'll wonder why he isn't. He's suffering.
M	TOBY	He's tested very well. He does B's in school.
F	MARGOT	But, that's how autism works. One part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged. ALAN We had him diagnosed, Margot. Nothing was found wrong. MARGOT Did you really, though?
M	TOBY	I'm...I'm not going to have this conversation. I'm sorry.
F	MARGOT	I know it must be so difficult for you, but I think you have to --
M	JIM'S VOICE	What are you doing?
F	MARGOT	I left you a note.
M	JIM'S VOICE	Come back. Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.
F	MARGOT	No...no. The wedding is on Saturday. I'm here for that. I can't really pull out. How would that look?
M	JIM'S VOICE	You haven't spoken to her in years -
F	MARGOT	Well, we're speaking now. She is my closest friend despite it all... You're the one who's been trying to get me to call her. JIM'S VOICE Did you tell Claude what you're doing?
F	MARGOT	Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's exactly what you'd imagine except I think he's clinically depressed.
M	MARGOT (CONT'D)	Not ugly, but completely unattractive. And he has no job. The best I can make out is that he's a letter writer. I don't know, the house looks weird to me...she's trying too hard and it's kind of a mess...they took down the swing...
F	MARGOT	Hello?
M	JIM'S VOICE	You said you weren't a hundred percent on this. You said that like a week ago. Can I come up there?
F	MARGOT	No. I don't want to see you -- I feel happier already having done it.
M	JIM'S VOICE	Really? You feel happier... Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more.
F	MARGOT	I need to tell him. And we need to tell Josh. Did he do his homework?
M	JIM'S VOICE	Yes.
F	MARGOT	This is happening and you have to get your mind around that.
F	MARGOT	Are you asleep?
M	CLAUDE	Yes.
F	MARGOT	Will you remember this?
M	CLAUDE	Yes.
F	MARGOT	I just talked to your dad...
F	MARGOT	I'm only going to tell you if you won't remember.
M	CLAUDE	Okay.
F	MARGOT	Everyone finds you so funny and charming. I always get compliments about you.
F	MARGOT	Are you having fun? Is it nice to see Pauline?
M	CLAUDE	Yeah, I really like her.
F	MARGOT	Yeah. She is crazy though. CLAUDE In what way? MARGOT She's really berserk. Maybe it's hormones. You don't notice anything different about Pauline? CLAUDE No.
F	MARGOT	She's pregnant -- she told me. But she's keeping it a secret -- I mean from Malcolm and even Ingrid. Which I think is unforgiveable. Now she'll have to marry him. What's she planning -- to get married and not drink champagne? Then she'll just be lying. I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. She probably will. I think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him.
M	CLAUDE	Are you stoned, Mom?
F	MARGOT	Maybe a little.
M	CLAUDE	I don't like it.
M	MALCOLM	My scrotum is longer than my penis.
M	MALCOLM	It's sweet how Claude looks up to me. He waits for a reaction and gets none.
M	MALCOLM	Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you made her out to be. PAULINE What she did to Toby and Alan tonight didn't seem crazy enough for you?
M	MALCOLM	I guess that seemed pretty crazy.
F	PAULINE	Well, she cares deeply.
M	MALCOLM	Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.
F	PAULINE	This has nothing to do with Bruce. She thinks everyone is autistic.
F	PAULINE	What?
M	MALCOLM	Nothing, you keep changing your position -- I'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not?
F	PAULINE	Well, can't she be both, care deeply and be crazy? Do people have to be all one thing?
M	MALCOLM	I guess not.
F	PAULINE	Well, okay... It is nice she came for the wedding. She's so pretty, don't you think?
M	MALCOLM	She's attractive.
F	PAULINE	A little thin maybe... But it is nice she came. MALCOLM Let's fuck.
M	MALCOLM	Fuck it!
F	MARGOT	Honey, you're up.
F	MARGOT	Claude, don't just whack it. Think about it before you hit.
M	CLAUDE	Sorry.
M	MALCOLM	Paul, what are you doing?
F	PAULINE	I'm sending Claude's ball into the bushes. MALCOLM Take the extra hit.
F	PAULINE	I don't want to do that. It's the smarter play.
F	PAULINE	Shit.
M	MALCOLM	Pauline! See, I knew you couldn't... Your feet are too small!
F	MARGOT	You took the awnings down.
F	PAULINE	Well done.
M	MALCOLM	Fuck you.
F	MARGOT	Honey, you're up. approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double
F	MARGOT	You're going the wrong way. CLAUDE Oh.
F	MARGOT	So stupid.
M	CLAUDE	Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.
M	CLAUDE	We're in the middle of it.
F	MARGOT	This is why I hate games. I hate what it does to me.
M	MALCOLM (O.S.)	Wait, we're not finished!
F	MARGOT	Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline sometimes can't make eye-contact. How her gaze hovers just above your head.
M	MALCOLM	Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.
F	MARGOT	I always think I have something in my hair. It's not necessarily bad, Paul. It's just something you do. PAULINE Claude have you ever seen your mother climb a tree?
M	CLAUDE	No.
F	MARGOT	We don't have much opportunity in Manhattan.
F	PAULINE	As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree.
M	CLAUDE	Can you do it, mom?
F	MARGOT	Maybe later.
M	CLAUDE	No, now.
F	INGRID	Do it now, Margot!
F	PAULINE	Show him, Margot.
F	PAULINE	I told you. Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep
F	MARGOT	Shit.
M	CLAUDE	What's she doing now?
F	PAULINE	She's stuck.
F	MARGOT	I got it.
M	CLAUDE	You were great on the way up. MARGOT Don't patronize me, Claude. Margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it.
F	PAULINE	We're all laughing, Margot.
F	MARGOT	You're laughing in a kind way. Claude is taking too much pleasure out of it.
M	CLAUDE	I am not.
F	MARGOT	You are. You like to make fun of me. To see me get embarrassed. It's mean.
F	PAULINE	What are you doing?
F	MARGOT	I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay?
F	PAULINE	I thought Claude could hand out programs. Ingrid's going to sing. Do you want to read a poem or something?
F	MARGOT	You know I can't speak in front of people. I'm doing this "conversation" at the bookstore in town on Friday and I totally regret having said I'd do it. PAULINE You're doing a "conversation?" MARGOT Yeah, talking about my work in front of a crowd. I didn't invite you because...I thought it'd be boring.
F	PAULINE	Uh huh.
F	MARGOT	What? Say it.
F	PAULINE	It's nothing. It's just...I would come...I want to come. I get a kick out of it. It's just weird, you know... So, you're not here for... Okay, I get it. When did they ask you?
F	MARGOT	A while ago. I'd said, No, but then when I was coming here anyway and...I guess it helps sales and...so...so.
F	PAULINE	I see.
F	PAULINE	Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes tied.
F	MARGOT	Why? Is she seeing someone? She's still obese, I assume.
F	PAULINE	I think it's symbolic.
F	MARGOT	I bet mom paid for it. We should audit mom.
F	PAULINE	I considered it in my twenties. You know, when I was fucking everyone. You remember. MARGOT I did my share. PAULINE But not like me.
F	MARGOT	You want to count?
F	PAULINE	No, Margot, I don't want to count. What was it about Dad that had us fucking so many guys?
F	MARGOT	I think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads. I don't think that's it. I just think it was something we were good at.
F	INGRID	Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.
M	CLAUDE	No, she said she had Aspergers.
F	INGRID	I thought that's what that means.
M	CLAUDE	No, it's like lesser retarded.
F	INGRID	I have adult ADD.
M	CLAUDE	You mean child ADD.
F	INGRID	No, for some reason I have the adult one. Maybe I'm retarded. ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year and Pauline slow down. Claude and Ingrid catch up.
M	MAN	Come on! LITTLE GIRL I don't want to!
M	MAN	Come on!
M	LITTLE GIRL	I don't want --
F	MARGOT	Hey!
F	MARGOT	Be careful!
M	WOMAN	What?
F	MARGOT	Be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. You'll take it out of its socket.
M	MAN	Don't tell us how to treat our child.
F	MARGOT	I don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt him.
F	PAULINE	It's a girl.
M	WOMAN	She threw a rock at me. MARGOT She's a little girl!
M	WOMAN	She knew what she was doing. starts suddenly toward Margot. WOMAN There is no hitting in our family. Do you understand?
M	WOMAN	Stay out of it, bitch.
F	INGRID	That was the Voglers.
F	PAULINE	Jesus, Margot, what are you doing. They already hate us.
F	MARGOT	Don't tell me what I can and can't do. That's child abuse.
M	CLAUDE	Mom, she was psychotic.
F	MARGOT	Stop picking on me. Everyone.
F	MARGOT	Oh God.
F	PAULINE	It could be anyone's. Margot bursts into tears. Pauline hesitates then holds her.
F	INGRID	What are they going to do to us? PAULINE They're not going to do anything, honey.
F	PAULINE	We have to cut down that tree.
M	MALCOLM	Where are we going to get married then?
F	PAULINE	I don't...we'll do it in the fucking drive-way if we have to.
F	INGRID	Your mom started a war. We have to make sure we wear shoes because they might start throwing glass.
M	CLAUDE	Has that happened before?
F	INGRID	I can't remember. I think so. No, it definitely has. Now I remember.
F	PAULINE	Where are you going?
F	MARGOT	To town. I'll be back for dinner.
F	PAULINE	Come on, nobody blames you, Margot.
M	CLAUDE	Is that Dick Koosman? PAULINE Yeah. He has a house up here. What's he doing with mom?
F	PAULINE	Good question.
F	INGRID	How much do your parents make in a year?
M	CLAUDE	I think about a hundred. They bank at Chase.
F	INGRID	Are they rich?
M	CLAUDE	No. They're middle class.
M	BOY	Just let me live!
F	INGRID	Upper or lower?
M	CLAUDE	I think just middle. Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the
F	MARGOT	Dick and his daughter asked us over to swim tomorrow.
F	PAULINE	We didn't invite them to the wedding.
F	MARGOT	You're not really friends.
F	PAULINE	We're friends enough that's it's awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.
F	MARGOT	He's doing the interview with me in town on Friday. Did I tell you, he and I are collaborating on a screenplay, an adaptation of one of Dick's novels.
F	PAULINE	No, I didn't even know you knew he was up here.
M	MALCOLM	Is he even a good writer? Why do people care about him?
F	PAULINE	You're competitive with everyone. It doesn't matter if they even do the same thing as you. He's competitive with Bono.
M	MALCOLM	It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo that there's enough room for everyone to be successful. I think there are only a few spots available and people like Dick Koosman and Bono are taking them up.
F	PAULINE	Malcolm, what would ever make you think that's something to draw right now?
M	MALCOLM	Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.
M	DICK	You found it!
F	PAULINE	What's up?
M	MALCOLM	I don't want to do this...
F	PAULINE	Come on, don't be that way.
M	MALCOLM	I'm not being that way -- I just don't feel like it. I'm going to go back and... I have work to do. PAULINE Dick doesn't care that you don't make any money.
M	MALCOLM	Is that why you think... That's not why I'm...I just hate swimming. I really hate it. It's disgusting to me. My mistake was saying I'd do it to begin with. You have fun. PAULINE Fine, we'll have fun.
M	MALCOLM	People always pee in the pool.
F	PAULINE	I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in their pool.
M	MALCOLM	I'll bet you 500 dollars there's pee in that pool.
F	PAULINE	To the end and back. Claude, you say Go.
M	CLAUDE	Okay.
M	CLAUDE	Go!
M	DICK	How's your dad?
M	CLAUDE	Good. DICK He and I shared a thesis advisor at Stanford. Did you know that?
M	CLAUDE	No. Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around.
M	DICK	I was dating your mom back then, did you know that?
M	CLAUDE	No.
M	CLAUDE	Pauline wins!
M	CLAUDE	Mom cheated. You didn't touch the wall!
F	MARGOT	I did so. It doesn't matter. I lost anyway.
F	PAULINE	It was close.
M	topples in.	roars around him. next to the drain is a field mouse. Its eyes are goes up.
F	PAULINE	It's okay.
F	MARGOT	I got him.
F	MARGOT	It's okay, my baby.
M	CLAUDE	I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
F	MARGOT	Now we're even.
F	PAULINE	Here you are.
F	MARGOT	You've got a problem. PAULINE What do you mean?
F	MARGOT	I don't like the girl and I don't like the way Malcolm looks at her.
F	PAULINE	Oh, come on, it's sexy.
F	MARGOT	You didn't see it. I saw it. You've got a problem.
F	PAULINE	I'm not worried. We could teach Claude how to swim.
F	MARGOT	He won't want to do it. It's too late.
F	MARGOT	Are you supposed to be doing that?
F	PAULINE	No.
F	PAULINE	I liked your last story in, was it Harpers? The one about mom. I was very...I liked it very much.
F	MARGOT	It wasn't really about mom.
F	PAULINE	I thought it was. Anyway. Why don't you want Claude to know how to swim?
F	MARGOT	I didn't say I didn't want him to. Why do you care? It's not in his life -- we're New Yorkers. If he wants to learn when he's older, he can. I'm curious why you're so interested in the whole thing. PAULINE I'm not. I'm just... As a safety thing and...I'm... Forget it. It's interesting -- this is the first time Dick has invited us over.
F	MARGOT	But are you really friends?
F	PAULINE	Kind of. We're neighbors. We employ Maisy. I mean I don't care, I just think it's interesting. Are you excited about the talk? I thought I'd come if that's okay. My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's it like to have a celebrity as a sister?" I said, I've got no problem with celebrity. Alice Munro taught at Bennington and was kind of a friend of mine.
F	MARGOT	I'm not a celebrity.
F	PAULINE	Well, you're well known.
F	MARGOT	To a very few people.
F	PAULINE	Just accept the compliment.
F	MARGOT	I guess I didn't realize it was a compliment. She crouches down and takes it. CLOSE: A note is being written.
F	MAISY	Singing?
M	CLAUDE	Hm? A bit.
F	MAISY	Can I make a suggestion?
M	CLAUDE	Uh huh.
F	MAISY	You should get underarm deodorant.
M	CLAUDE	Uh huh.
F	MAISY	You kind of smell.
F	MAISY	Better I tell you than someone else.
F	MARGOT	I think you smell nice. You smell real.
M	CLAUDE	I stink.
F	MARGOT	causes cancer.
M	CLAUDE	deodorant?
F	MARGOT	It's got chemicals and things are extremely harmful.
M	CLAUDE	not going to die from underarm
F	MARGOT	you'll get it somewhere else. your stomach or your
M	CLAUDE	
F	MARGOT	laugh, that's a serious told you this, anyway? Maisy?
M	CLAUDE	
F	MARGOT	hope you're not interested in girl. I find her
M	CLAUDE	does that mean?
F	MARGOT	means I can't suffer her. She's and stupid. She goes on about of which she knows nothing
M	CLAUDE	got into Harvard early. MARGOT people get into Harvard all the time.
M	CLAUDE	Where did you go again?
F	MARGOT	Barnard. I just don't think you should do anything with her.
M	CLAUDE	We're just friends.
F	MARGOT	If you do, use a condom.
M	CLAUDE	Where are you going?
F	MARGOT	Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.
M	CLAUDE	Are kids coming?
F	INGRID	Who do we know who's gay? MAISY How do I know what gay people you know. CLAUDE Alan and Toby. INGRID And Bruce. He's gay and Aspergers.
M	CLAUDE	I don't know if Bruce is gay.
F	INGRID	He might be, it's very common.
M	CLAUDE	Your mom is pregnant.
F	INGRID	No she isn't.
M	CLAUDE	She is.
F	MAISY	How do you know that, Claude?
M	CLAUDE	She told my mom. But you can tell - - she's hormonally weird.
F	MAISY	Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to have a baby sister or brother.
F	INGRID	My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.
M	CLAUDE	Who cares.
F	MAISY	Do you think your mom is fuckable? CLAUDE I don't know.
F	MAISY	I think she's hot, your mother. I'd do her if I was gay. I might anyway. I mean if she came on to me. CLAUDE She won't.
F	INGRID	I'm not going to do anyone.
M	CLAUDE	What was that?
F	INGRID	Is it scary?
F	PAULINE	Margot used to never speak. I remember when we went on a double date in high school, that kid Ron asked you if English was your first language.
F	MARGOT	It's true. I used to think I might have some kind of brain defect. PAULINE You thought you were aphasic.
F	MARGOT	I'm still not sure. PAULINE Oh, Jesus, Margot. MARGOT It's very possible, Paul.
F	PAULINE	I just...your diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me.
F	MARGOT	Malcolm, can you slow down.
M	MALCOLM	What?
M	DICK	I can drive if you like.
M	MALCOLM	No, you got dinner, the driving's on me.
M	DICK	Well, I'll let you pay your half if you'll slow down.
M	MALCOLM	Well, neither Pauline or I ordered dessert.
F	PAULINE	Malcolm, let it go. Margot would insist on driving if she knew how.
F	MARGOT	My license elapsed. But I know how.
M	MALCOLM	It's probably for the best. I have this theory, I think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. It's akin to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls. DICK That's a charming philosophy.
F	MARGOT	Yeah. Tell that one a lot.
M	MALCOLM	This isn't a blanket thing. I mean, women can be great drivers too...
F	PAULINE	Said the man with the moustache that he thinks he's wearing in quotes.
F	MARGOT	It's meant to be funny.
M	MALCOLM	Are you doing this for her benefit or mine?
M	MALCOLM	What the fuck?
F	PAULINE	What?
M	MALCOLM	No, there they go. Okay. It's fine. I thought I had no brakes for a minute... MARGOT Malcolm! grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
M	MALCOLM	What?! MARGOT Watch it!
M	MALCOLM	It's fine, Margot!
F	PAULINE	You're just so incompetent.
M	MALCOLM	Why don't you fucking drive yourselves home!
F	PAULINE	Oh, God.
F	MARGOT	You should go after her.
M	DICK	Come back with me tonight.
F	MARGOT	I've got Claude.
M	DICK	Come on, I've been trying to get you up here all year.
F	MARGOT	She's pregnant. Dick leans over to Margot's neck. He licks her. Claude lies in bed with Ingrid. He chews off a piece of his
F	INGRID	Why are you putting that there?
M	CLAUDE	I just want to keep it.
F	INGRID	I left a piece of skin in a movie theater once so it could watch movies all its life.
M	CLAUDE	I don't know if it's the same thing.
F	INGRID	Are you obsessed with Maisy?
M	CLAUDE	No.
F	INGRID	You're always staring at her tits.
F	INGRID	You have a moustache.
M	CLAUDE	My mom bleaches it.
F	INGRID	I'm going to kiss your cheek and then you kiss mine.
M	CLAUDE	I don't want to do that.
F	INGRID	Why not? CLAUDE Because it's pointless... hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door
F	INGRID	Where are you going? I thought we were having a conversation.
M	CLAUDE	You're starting to annoy me. What are you doing?
M	CLAUDE	I didn't think you came home.
F	MARGOT	Where would I be?
M	CLAUDE	Can't Josh and Dad come to the wedding?
F	MARGOT	We've been through this. Go to bed. Claude slides down to the floor. He hesitates. CLAUDE Can I sleep in here? MARGOT No, honey. CLAUDE We can put a pillow between us.
F	MARGOT	Okay. Just for tonight.
F	MARGOT	When you were a baby I wouldn't let anyone else hold you. I think that may have been a mistake.
F	INGRID	Why was it a secret?
F	PAULINE	Because I didn't want to get you excited before it was real. It's not really a baby yet. In two more weeks we can celebrate together, okay?
F	INGRID	Why did you tell Margot?
F	PAULINE	Because she's my sister and I trust her. How do you feel about it?
F	INGRID	I don't want a sister. Pauline touches Ingrid's hair gently.
F	INGRID	I'm going to go get Wizard. She runs toward the house. Pauline marches toward Malcolm.
F	PAULINE	Margot told Claude something I expressly told her in confidence. And he told Ingrid.
M	PAULINE (CONT'D)	I'm stunned that she put me in this position. It's so fucking infuriating.
M	MALCOLM	Well it's that thing where--
F	PAULINE	Don't say anything. You know what...just be there for me. Silently.
M	MALCOLM	Okay.
F	PAULINE	Why do I have to be so careful around her, but everyone is allowed to make fun of me?
M	MALCOLM	I don't know if --
F	PAULINE	Malcolm, what did I just say? You know, I just want you to take my side, I don't need you to make it better.
F	PAULINE	Ingrid's really upset about it. Fuck. I can't believe she did this to me! I didn't tell you because... I didn't want you to feel like you had to marry me. I found out right before our seminar... I'm pregnant.
M	MALCOLM	Uh huh. PAULINE Well...does that sound good to you?
M	MALCOLM	I'm still digesting Margot telling Claude. What a fucking nut job. Sorry. I think I'm really happy.
F	PAULINE	Come here, honey!
M	CLAUDE (O.S.)	Hey. Margot starts and shoves the drawer shut.
F	MARGOT	Hey. I'm just looking at Pauline's incense and self-help books. I don't understand it. This junk makes her look stupid and she's not. I don't like to think of her this way.
M	CLAUDE	Uh huh.
F	MARGOT	She's such a hypocrite. Somehow I'm a kook for going to therapy, but she's got enough drugs here to medicate a... ...an elephant. And she's always with these losers.
M	CLAUDE	Malcolm's not a loser.
F	MARGOT	Claude...think about it.
M	CLAUDE	He's cool.
F	MARGOT	What makes you think he's cool? I'm more talking about her investment in things like the Forum and ashrams.
M	CLAUDE	What's the Forum?
F	MARGOT	Like a cult.
M	CLAUDE	She was in a cult?
F	MARGOT	Years ago. She and Lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the Mukdananda who made her drink his bath water. Who knows what she's doing now. Margot! Claude! Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds. CLAUDE Wizard! We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell: Wizard! Wiz!
F	MARGOT	Wizard! Here, boy!
F	MARGOT	How long has he been gone?
F	PAULINE	I don't know. Ingrid brought him in last night, but we couldn't find him this morning.
F	MARGOT	Oh boy.
F	PAULINE	Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?
F	MARGOT	I don't know.
F	PAULINE	You did.
F	MARGOT	I guess I said something.
F	PAULINE	You did. You don't have to tell him everything.
F	MARGOT	He wants to know. If I don't tell him, he figures it out.
M	INGRID (O.S.)	Where is Wizard? approaches with Claude. PAULINE I don't know, honey. sinks into her mother's body. Claude and Margot walk
M	CLAUDE	You didn't let him go out into the road or something where something could've happened to him?
F	MARGOT	Why would you think I'd do something like that? That's awful.
M	CLAUDE	I just... I'm just making sure.
F	MARGOT	That's a terrible thing to say to me.
M	CLAUDE	I didn't mean on purpose, I just meant maybe in case...you knew something. I'm sorry.
F	MARGOT	Woa!
M	MALCOLM	Hey, sorry. I'm here.
F	MARGOT	No, I... I should've looked.
M	MALCOLM	I'm just writing my vows. Trying to do something appropriate but also funny -- not jokey, more character based humor. Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm MALCOLM You having an okay time?
F	MARGOT	Oh, yeah. Besides Wizard getting --
M	MALCOLM	Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or else, I don't know...
F	MARGOT	We won't.
M	MALCOLM	Right, or else he's dead or something. It means a lot to Paul that you came.
F	MARGOT	Yeah.
F	MARGOT	Oh God, this is the same toaster we had here as kids. Paul is so weird.
M	MALCOLM	I hear you've heard the news.
F	MARGOT	Yeah. Congratulations.
M	MALCOLM	Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in. It's a little abstract still. I haven't had that thing yet where you realize that you're not the most important person in the world. I'm anxious for that to happen. I guess I have to thank you -- I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived. MARGOT You're welcome.
M	MALCOLM	Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass some not so great genes onto the kid. I mean, in my family there's a lot of hand washing, you know. I don't have it, but my brother does. You working on anything now?
F	MARGOT	Besides the thing with Dick?
M	MALCOLM	Oh, right.
F	MARGOT	How about you?
M	MALCOLM	Oh, I'm working on some acrylic paint --
F	MARGOT	Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
F	MARGOT	Sorry, what were you --
M	MALCOLM	Nothing. It doesn't matter.
F	MARGOT	No, what were you saying?
M	MALCOLM	It really... Nothing.
F	MARGOT	Okay.
M	MALCOLM	I was saying I'm doing these abstractions in acrylic paint. But it's not... I'm not getting paid or anything. I don't know, I hate that question, "What do you do?" MARGOT You asked me.
M	MALCOLM	I know, but...
M	MALCOLM	I think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on Saturday and it will be louder than usual.
F	PAULINE	And that they can come for a glass of champagne. But you tell them. I think they respond to you better.
M	MALCOLM	Well, I am ultimately one of them. You shouldn't've made me shave the stache.
F	PAULINE	Yeah, right.
M	MALCOLM	Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I was ever gay. Do you know what that's about?
F	PAULINE	No. PAULINE Hi. Vogler stops. His face is jagged and worn. PAULINE Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm. We've met before. We're your neighbors. The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.
M	VOGLER	You gonna cut that tree down?
F	PAULINE	Well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it Saturday and --
M	VOGLER	The roots are growing into our property. It's rotting, it's killing our plants.
F	PAULINE	We had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy.
F	PAULINE	Would it hurt you to say anything?
M	MALCOLM	What? What do you want from me?
F	PAULINE	You're making me do the whole fucking thing.
M	MALCOLM	You brought up the tree.
F	PAULINE	He brought up --
F	PAULINE	I'm sorry... This was better thought-through back at the house. gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot PAULINE We were wondering if you and your wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name -- would like to come over for...
M	VOGLER	You should ask her. She makes the plans. I'm going to go in now.
M	MALCOLM	I felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what I wanted to say.
M	MALCOLM	I want to punch that guy in the nose!
F	PAULINE	You've never hit anyone.
M	MALCOLM	I have too!
F	PAULINE	Who?
M	MALCOLM	Lots of -- You don't know them. They're not around because I've punched them.
M	MALCOLM	Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny. I'll fucking punch your sister.
M	MALCOLM	The threat is not out there. It's in our house. It's sleeping in my studio. I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her, but I feel...I feel like doing it. She's such a fucking idiot.
F	PAULINE	She's not an idiot. You might not like her --
M	MALCOLM	She is. She is an idiot! You're an idiot.
F	PAULINE	Jesus.
M	MALCOLM	You're both fucking morons. I'm so fucking... I'm trying so hard. You don't give me any credit.
F	PAULINE	What is wrong?
M	MALCOLM	I don't know, I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. I don't know. You tell me, you understand this shit.
F	PAULINE	Did you drink your teas?
M	MALCOLM	Yeah, I drank my fucking teas! Don't judge me now. Really, I think when you look back at this you're going to see I'm not acting like a crazy person. That this is the right reaction. In proportion with what is going on. This is right!
F	PAULINE	You have the most oddly self- conscious form of rage I've ever --
M	MALCOLM	I hate you. he approaches her. He says, still with anger:
M	MALCOLM	Let's make love.
F	PAULINE	Jim...
M	CLAUDE (O.S.)	Dad!
M	JIM	It was a difficult decision because Claude has so many friends at school now, but it is expensive and Bronx Science is a great public school.
M	CLAUDE	I didn't get into Stuyvesant.
F	MARGOT	He's not a good test taker.
M	MALCOLM	I went to Stuy.
F	MARGOT	Really?
M	MALCOLM	Really. CLAUDE I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
M	JIM	Josh is a great test taker, but Claude thinks more abstractly. He's more creative. Right?
M	CLAUDE	I guess so.
M	JIM	I saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega.
M	CLAUDE	Did you give him confusing change?
M	JIM	I did. I tripped him up with some nickels. And a Canadian quarter.
M	MALCOLM	You know what I tried the other day? Sitting down to pee. Have you done this, Jim?
M	JIM	No...no.
M	MALCOLM	I did it as a lark. As a joke really. I was going to call Pauline in and say, guess what I'm doing here...
F	PAULINE	I'm sorry I didn't get to have that experience.
M	MALCOLM	I was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "Why stand when you can sit." And this is a really good example of that. I mean, it took me so long to try because I was embarrassed. You guys do it all the time. MARGOT I never sit down in a public place. I squat and hover.
M	MALCOLM	Anyway, I recommend it. At least to try it.
F	PAULINE	Jim, I'm sorry about the room. It's usually Malcolm's storage room so it's kind of make-shift right now.
M	JIM	It's fine.
M	JIM	Margot, open your gift.
F	MARGOT	I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people. This weekend is about Pauline.
F	PAULINE	Oh...poo. Open it Margot.
F	PAULINE	Come on, get to it.
M	MALCOLM	Those look warm. JIM I remember last year in Vermont you said your feet were freezing. eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She
F	MARGOT	Thank you.
F	MARGOT	I already have slippers.
M	JIM	Well, that's okay. Two sets are fine, right?
F	MARGOT	It makes me sad to get a present that I already have.
M	JIM	Why?
F	MARGOT	It makes me feel like you don't know me.
M	JIM	What's wrong with your ear?
F	MARGOT	I asked you not to come. I was so clear and you did it anyway so blithely.
M	JIM	We need time alone to sort this out. You can't just run away --
F	MARGOT	Okay, so we're here. I'm giving you this time.
M	JIM	Well, now you're putting too much pressure on me. Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back. He takes JIM What is that? His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They
F	MARGOT	Keep driving.
F	MARGOT	No...no...no. Jim, no.
M	JIM	Let me just...
M	WOMAN	Please help me.
M	WOMAN	Please help me. He got hit by a car. Please help me.
F	MARGOT	Jim...
M	WOMAN	Help me!
F	MARGOT	Careful, he might bite you!
M	WOMAN	Hurry...he's dying. He's dying. Margot puts her hands over her ears. Jim speeds up.
M	WOMAN	He didn't do anything. Roger is an innocent. He's an innocent creature.
F	MARGOT	Oh, God.
M	JIM	Margot.
F	MARGOT	I can't stand her.
F	MARGOT	You paid, didn't you?
M	JIM	She didn't have her purse with her. It wasn't so expensive. Roger's going to live.
F	MARGOT	I don't give a fuck about Roger. And...that makes me feel like shit. You make me feel like shit. I wouldn't have stopped.
M	JIM	Of course you would've.
F	MARGOT	No, I wouldn't've. I would have kept driving. I hate myself when I'm with you.
M	JIM	Margot, I'm not... I can't talk to you when you're this fucked up.
F	MARGOT	You're just like Claude in that way...you make me feel guilty. Sometimes I find you so despicable. Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly What's wrong?
F	MARGOT	I don't know. Before you gave me your sweater I think I didn't realize I was cold.
F	MARGOT	Take me home and go away.
F	MARGOT	If it were someone else I'd understand it, I'd feel sympathy even. But since it's me, I just feel bad. And horribly critical. I haven't been able to tell Claude what's happening. And I have to. I'm going to. How can I be all these people? How can I be married to Jim. And fuck Dick. And want them both and then neither of them...
F	PAULINE	I know. We're at the age where we're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us, it's very tempting.
F	MARGOT	What are you saying?
F	PAULINE	I'm saying, if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane -- it's very hard. I almost had an affair too. But you know, you don't have to do it. You can, I don't know, get a manicure or something.
F	PAULINE	You know I tell people you're my closest friend. I really miss you.
F	MARGOT	Me too.
F	PAULINE	But I can't help feeling that you really came to my wedding because I live a mile away from the guy you're fucking.
F	MARGOT	Come on, Pauline. You make it sound like I'm using you.
F	PAULINE	Yeah.
F	PAULINE	You have a...
F	MARGOT	Did I get it?
F	PAULINE	Yeah, I think so.
F	MARGOT	Paul, what are you doing getting married to this guy? He's not good enough for you. He's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen. You know...don't make a mistake like this. I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to say that, but you know I'm truthful so... Would you rather I lie?
F	PAULINE	Who should I be with then?
M	MARGOT (O.S.)	Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up. I will call the police. This is our property. Pick that up.
F	MARGOT	Creeps.
M	CLAUDE	Dogs usually come back, I think.
F	INGRID	What happened to your dad?
M	CLAUDE	He went to Vermont.
F	INGRID	He didn't want to come to the wedding?
M	CLAUDE	I don't think he could... I think he couldn't. You want to see me dance? INGRID Okay. Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a
F	INGRID	Wizard...
M	CLAUDE	You're not watching.
M	BOY	Where are you going?
M	CLAUDE	We have to get home.
M	BOY	Is that your girlfriend?
M	CLAUDE	No, she's my cousin.
M	BOY	You a fruity?
M	CLAUDE	Um...no.
M	BOY	You a fruity?
F	INGRID	No.
M	BOY	We will hurt you. takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away.
F	INGRID	He's a Vogler.
M	CLAUDE	He's just a stupid boy.
F	INGRID	Hold it, I have a rock in my sandal.
M	CLAUDE	Come on, Ingrid.
F	INGRID	Oww!
M	CLAUDE	Get him off me. Ingrid!
M	CLAUDE	Ayy! Help me!
F	MARGOT	Woa, don't run so fast. CLAUDE There's a boy! He bit me!
F	MARGOT	Who bit you? CLAUDE A boy. A Vogler! Where's Ingrid?
F	MARGOT	Let me see.
F	MARGOT	I'm calling the police.
M	CLAUDE	No, don't! It'll get worse. Why did you say anything to them?
F	MARGOT	Claude, this isn't my fault.
M	CLAUDE	That boy bit me because you couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.
F	MARGOT	Claude, you're being a jerk.
M	CLAUDE	You shit in your shoes and then you fuck them!
F	PAULINE	You really want to know? I'll tell you. She wrote a story about Lenny and me. Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning. Maybe a couple of remarks that she'd used some things of ours... Then The New Yorker comes -- we have a subscription -- and there's the story and... It's things we said and did -- stuff I told her in confidence. I think it helped end our marriage. I read it and thought, "She hates me."
M	CLAUDE	She doesn't hate you.
F	PAULINE	You think? Margot tried to murder me when we were girls. She put me on a baking sheet, sprinkled me with paprika and put me in the oven.
F	MARGOT	Jim was here.
M	DICK	Is Jim still writing?
F	MARGOT	I told him to go to Vermont without me.
M	DICK	I'd love to see him tell a linear story for a change. Jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader, did he. The nicest man I've ever met, but he can't play the game.
F	MARGOT	I'm not joining him. I'm going to stay here and then...we'll see. Right. Okay? DICK I didn't ask you to do that. The guy's pointing at us...
M	DICK	I'm very interested in your story "Middle Children."
M	DICK	The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.
F	MARGOT	Yeah, well I was very interested in exploring a father-daughter relationship. While he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.
M	DICK	There's this sexualized push-pull with Daphne which I find --
F	MARGOT	He craves isolation really. I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.
M	DICK	You make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter.
F	MARGOT	Right, that's true. That's true.
M	DICK	I write historical fiction so I don't have to answer to this, but I wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait?
F	MARGOT	My father was a loving person. He had his days, of course, but...he was devoted to us as children. I wouldn't have written this portrait were it true.
M	DICK	But I'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you. stares, dumbstruck.
F	MARGOT	Umm...I don't... Why do you assume it's based on... We all take from life. I had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in Manhattan. I was alone with a guy, I think he was Puerto Rican, sent over by...Whirlpool, I think it is who made our fridge. Although he said he worked for an independent organization who Whirlpool subcontracts. I think he was retarded. There was an anger in him and suddenly I became afraid for my life. I called Jim at NYU. I asked him to come home.
F	MARGOT	It might be Frigidaire... I'm sorry... I don't... I'm not sure what I'm... I think I need to take a moment...
F	MARGOT	You're an asshole...
F	MARGOT	I need to be alone right now, okay?
M	CLAUDE	What's wrong?
F	MARGOT	I don't know. I'll tell you sometime. Go on.
M	CLAUDE	Are you sure?
F	MARGOT	Yes. Go with mom. I'll see you later.
M	CLAUDE	You said, mom.
F	MARGOT	But you know what I mean. Go with Pauline. Jesus, do I...do I need to spell it out for you? Go. With. Her.
F	PAULINE	Are you okay?
M	CLAUDE	I'm okay.
F	PAULINE	You're your mom's favorite. Do you know that? CLAUDE I don't think she has a favorite.
F	PAULINE	She's always liked you best. More than Jim even.
M	CLAUDE	But they're married. It's different.
F	PAULINE	But she still loves you best. It's hard, I think, to find people in the world you love more than your family.
M	CLAUDE	I like Malcolm.
F	PAULINE	Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do too. I can teach you to swim if you like.
M	CLAUDE	No, thanks.
F	PAULINE	Has your mother talked to you yet?
M	CLAUDE	I don't think so. About what?
F	PAULINE	Are you okay? It's hard to see your mom like that -- get attacked like that. Right? It was mean what he did. I think it was really shitty.
M	CLAUDE	Mm hm.
F	PAULINE	You know, I think your mom's going through a rough time right now and...whatever she tells you...like if she says she's leaving your father...remember that she often changes her mind and... I don't want you to worry about anything right now.
F	INGRID	He's cutting it down.
F	PAULINE	Good.
F	MAISY	My dad's late to pick me up. I hope I'm not a pain.
F	PAULINE	You're not a pain.
F	MARGOT	I told Paul I didn't want you guys to come.
M	CLAUDE	I thought it was interesting. MARGOT What did Paul say?
M	CLAUDE	I think she liked it.
F	MARGOT	Yeah, right. Did you talk about me afterwards? CLAUDE No.
F	MARGOT	I can tell you're lying.
M	CLAUDE	We didn't, mom.
F	MARGOT	I don't trust her.
M	CLAUDE	She really loves you. She does.
F	MARGOT	Pauline told me she's very disappointed in you.
M	CLAUDE	Why?
F	MARGOT	She thinks you laze about the house. Ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook. She made bracelets for all the guests. Even Malcolm puts up the tent. You just wait until everyone else does it for you.
M	CLAUDE	That's not true.
F	MARGOT	It is true. You're never helpful. I wish I had taught you better manners.
M	CLAUDE	I can try to make popovers. If I can remember how.
F	MARGOT	Don't bother. looks at him with grave disappointment. CLAUDE Why are you looking at me like that?
F	MARGOT	I just see how much you've changed. Your body language. You used to be rounder and more graceful. You're so stiff now. So blase.
M	CLAUDE	What do you mean?
F	MARGOT	I can't explain it.
F	MARGOT	It's okay though.
M	CLAUDE	Uh huh.
F	MARGOT	You're still handsome.
F	PAULINE	Are you able to do this yourself?
M	MALCOLM	Pauline, do you want me to cut it down or not? PAULINE Watch the tent. The jagged blades pierce the trunk. Pauline crunches her He walks around the tree and inspects the bark.
M	MALCOLM	I liked how it looked on Vogler. Pauline starts to say something -- stops. Then:
F	PAULINE	I think it's over between Dick and Margot. He was so cruel to her today. And poor Claude had to watch it all. She should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants, you know. It's cowardly. And Dick Koosman. What a choice. I mean...you know?
M	MALCOLM	I agree. I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.
F	PAULINE	What does that mean? You want to fuck Margot?
M	MALCOLM	Pauline, that's not what I said.
F	PAULINE	I know you have a crush on her, you already told me that.
M	MALCOLM	I didn't say that. I said I thought she was attractive after you grilled me. She has no interest in me anyway. Not that it would matter if she did.

M	MALCOLM	I'm going to tell you... Just let me... Maisy...
F	PAULINE	I don't want to know.
M	MALCOLM	...we didn't really do anything. We were goofing around, I was making fun of her cause she dates a jock... PAULINE I don't want to know.
M	MALCOLM	I shouldn't've put myself in that position, I know that. We brushed lips really. It was barely a kiss. And then we stopped. That was it. nose runs. He wipes it messily with his arm.
M	MALCOLM	Our tongues touched. I don't want to under-sell it either. I mean... We made out. I made out with her. I don't know why. I don't even like her. It's been a heady time. What are you thinking? Please, tell me what you're thinking.
F	INGRID	Has anyone seen Wizard?
F	PAULINE	No. Where's Maisy?
F	INGRID	Upstairs, I think with Claude.
F	MAISY	Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I hope that's okay I used yours.
F	MAISY	I love your wedding dress. It's so unconventional and great. Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows. MAISY Is everything okay?
F	PAULINE	Nothing.
F	MAISY	Claude, do you want to play croquet?
M	CLAUDE	Okay.
F	INGRID	There's Dick.
F	INGRID	Is it almost ready?
M	MALCOLM	Almost. Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts
M	MALCOLM	I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything!
M	DICK	Fucking sleazebag!
M	DICK	I don't ever want to see you again.
M	MALCOLM	Fuck off, dickhead.
M	MALCOLM	Ow! lights a brown cigarette and walks away. Malcolm MALCOLM Fucking dickbag! She's lying! touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
M	MALCOLM	Oh, man.
F	MARGOT	Come with me to New York.
F	PAULINE	I can't talk about it --
F	MARGOT	Okay, but you can't marry him. You have to go now. We can think about what to do with the baby --
F	PAULINE	Margot, I can't --
F	MARGOT	Don't turn vague, listen to me --
F	PAULINE	I want you to pack all your things and get out of here. You can take our car and leave it at the ferry. What?
M	CLAUDE	I'll help out more. I can make popovers. Pauline looks at Claude strangely. She leans down and kisses PAULINE Do you love me? Good.
F	MARGOT	Don't take this out on me? I'm on your side.
F	PAULINE	No, you're not. You're not.
F	MARGOT	I've kept my mouth shut because --
F	PAULINE	No, you haven't kept your mouth shut! No you haven't...kept your mouth shut...
F	MARGOT	Okay, I told you and I was right. He's done an insane thing. You don't know this man. What he did is criminal.
F	PAULINE	Margot, I can't...
F	MARGOT	It's pedophilia.
F	PAULINE	Get out!
F	PAULINE	Becky and I talk about you -- about what a monster you are. Is it cause Mom gave me the house? Can't I have anything? What was I thinking? I let you in. Get! Out!
F	MARGOT	What? What are you saying? I don't recognize you -- it's like you're channelling someone.
F	PAULINE	Ingrid!
F	PAULINE	Ingrid!
F	INGRID	What?
F	INGRID	Ow!
F	INGRID	It wasn't going to fall! PAULINE I'm sorry. Malcolm trudges up the stairs. He's bloody and tattered. INGRID Wizard! She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar. The three of There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --
M	CLAUDE	I thought you couldn't drive.
F	MARGOT	I can drive. Why does everyone say that? I used to drive.
F	PAULINE	We have to call people and cancel.
F	INGRID	What happened? Can I still sing?
F	MARGOT	You do smell.
M	CLAUDE	Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant. They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend. MARGOT Shit.
M	CLAUDE	What? I don't think... No... We don't have brakes.
F	PAULINE	The brakes are bad, that's right.
M	CLAUDE	What does that mean?
F	MARGOT	What do you think it means?
M	CLAUDE	I mean, what can we do?
M	CLAUDE	Mom.
F	MARGOT	I ruined these shoes. Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain. She races
F	INGRID	Mom, are you okay? Don't look! Shit!
F	INGRID	Mom, what happened? Nothing.
F	PAULINE	Fuck. Margot turns to the kids. Ingrid hides a smile.
M	CLAUDE	Did she poop in her pants?
F	MARGOT	It happens to everyone. Not just babies. It'll happen to you too someday.
F	PAULINE	I left mom and Becky a message.
F	MARGOT	I don't think mom knows how to work the machine. Margot puts her pinky in her ear.
F	MARGOT	I can hear it flapping.
F	PAULINE	You should take care of that. It can hatch eggs.
F	MARGOT	Sweety, there's a bus that leaves to Vermont from town tomorrow morning. I just talked to your dad and he's going to pick you up.
M	CLAUDE	Aren't you coming?
F	MARGOT	No.
M	CLAUDE	Why not?
F	MARGOT	I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.
M	CLAUDE	I don't want to go tomorrow. The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting. Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people
F	PAULINE	There's Malcolm.
F	PAULINE	I can't live in that house alone.
F	MARGOT	You're going to be fine.
F	PAULINE	Maybe...maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or something. People are living there right?
F	MARGOT	You don't want to live there. It's all young people.
F	PAULINE	But what do you think of that idea?
F	MARGOT	Maybe. Let's see. You know if you don't want to come with me, I'm sure mom will let you stay with her
F	PAULINE	You're already trying to pass me off on mom...
F	MARGOT	Don't say that. Come on, you'll come home with us. PAULINE You don't even know where you're going to live. You might have to move in with mom too. tightens. PAULINE What? Oh. Didn't you tell him?
F	PAULINE	What have I done? What have I done?
M	CLAUDE	What?
F	MARGOT	Nothing. Just then I felt so much love for you.
F	MARGOT	Hey!
F	PAULINE	You cannot write about this. You can't have it. MARGOT I wasn't writing about you. PAULINE You already took a part of my life, you can't have any more. And that goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and Wizard. We all own our own rights. They're not for sale. MARGOT Give it back.
F	PAULINE	If I could read your handwriting I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I ever see a story that involves a hotel room or any of this shit, I will fucking take your bowels out.
F	PAULINE	You've now successfully ruined two of my marriages.
F	MARGOT	You're not wearing any underwear.
F	PAULINE	It's hot, I'm pregnant. Move over. Jesus.
F	MARGOT	You're not hot, your feet are cold.
F	PAULINE	Stop touching me. I am so hot. Feel my head.
F	MARGOT	You have a fever.
F	PAULINE	I don't have a fever... I'm pregnant...are you always like this?
F	MARGOT	Get used to it... Mom and Becky share a bed -- you and I will probably get the other.
F	PAULINE	You should just go to Vermont.
F	MARGOT	I was thinking -- you know if you want -- you and Ingrid could go to Vermont. Keep Claude company and Jim adores you.
F	PAULINE	You don't like Malcolm because you're not attracted to him.
F	MARGOT	Will you do it?
F	PAULINE	No. I won't do that for you.
F	MARGOT	Did you two talk about me in town? What did you say?
F	PAULINE	I told him you often change your mind.
F	MARGOT	I'm sorry, sweety. There's something wrong with me. PAULINE I'm going to call him. Margot quickly turns to her sister.
F	MARGOT	No. Don't. I'm telling you.
F	PAULINE	I...I need some clothes and things.
F	MARGOT	He should get the hell out of our house.
F	PAULINE	Okay. I'll tell him to get the hell out of our house.
M	MALCOLM'S VOICE	The tent looks so lonely.
F	PAULINE	It has no one to get married in it.
M	MALCOLM	I know. And it's smashed. I'm such a fucking idiot. Please don't take me seriously. I mean take me seriously, but not the fucked up parts, you know. I love you so much. Please marry me.
F	PAULINE	You can't do what you did again. Do you understand? MALCOLM I promise. PAULINE No matter how tempting. At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent- Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to You left it in my room.
F	PAULINE	I don't know. I don't know.
M	MALCOLM	I ate some of the cake. I don't know why, but I did it.
F	PAULINE	What was... How was it?
M	MALCOLM	Good.
F	PAULINE	It's not too sweet? They sometimes make their stuff too sweet.
M	MALCOLM	Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't even notice... They fucked up the cake. How sad. I love our little baby. I miss you.
F	PAULINE	I miss you too. Maybe we should do another seminar.
F	PAULINE	I can't understand you, honey. finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her INGRID There's gramma and Aunt Becky! startles and looks out the window. Across the street
F	PAULINE	They didn't get my message.
F	MARGOT	I told you she can't work the machine --
F	PAULINE	What? You're not coming?
F	MARGOT	I'm coming, I'm coming. What did he say?
F	MARGOT	What did he say?
F	MARGOT	Don't worry, I got it.
M	PAULINE/INGRID	Mom!/Nana!
F	MARGOT	Don't look. Keep walking.
M	CLAUDE	Why are we -- MARGOT We have to get you to your bus.
M	CLAUDE	Did you do something?
F	MARGOT	What do you mean, do something?
M	CLAUDE	I mean, why is the wedding not happening? Is there something that you did?
F	MARGOT	Pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me. I don't understand her anymore. Why'd she pick this man? It is really berserk. And you know, she referred to me as her closest friend. We never see one anoth --
F	MARGOT	I mean we're not close. Even if we want to be. You know?
M	CLAUDE	But was there anything real?
F	MARGOT	No! How many times do I have to say it? Jesus. You think so little of me. It's good you're going. You shouldn't be around me either. I'd go if I were you... CLAUDE Will you find Pauline and Nana after I leave?
F	MARGOT	I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church.
M	CLAUDE	Are you angry at me?
F	MARGOT	No, honey. I'm not mad at you.
M	CLAUDE	I don't want to go with you mad at anyone.
F	MARGOT	Everything's fine. I'm not mad at anyone.
M	CLAUDE	Can you come with me?
F	MARGOT	No, you know that. We should talk about the next few months a little bit and what's going to happen --
M	CLAUDE	I don't like Vermont.
F	MARGOT	Your dad will be very happy to see you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to hang out.
M	CLAUDE	Please come, mom.
F	MARGOT	Claude, stop it. Okay? watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man. MARGOT You used to need me to watch you when you played. What do you mean?
F	MARGOT	When you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless I watched you. You were afraid I would go out the back door. I don't know where I would go. Our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.
M	CLAUDE	I masturbated last night. While everyone was asleep I went into the bathroom and did it.
F	MARGOT	You don't have to tell me, sweety.
F	MARGOT	You've got to go.
M	CLAUDE	How will you get home?
F	MARGOT	I don't know. I'll see. Maybe Dick can drive me to the... Jesus, I lost the word for a second. The train. CLAUDE Uh huh. looks at her longingly. MARGOT Come on. You always don't want to leave me and you always have a good time once you do. I think you like getting away from me.
M	CLAUDE	I do not. I like hanging out with you.
M	CLAUDE	The world feels strange to me right now.
M	CLAUDE	What?
F	MARGOT	They make your face look too wide.
M	CLAUDE	See you soon.
F	MARGOT	Bye, sweety.
M	CLAUDE	Say, you'll see me "soon."
F	MARGOT	You're acting like a baby.
M	CLAUDE	Don't see Dick.
F	MARGOT	Don't worry. I don't think he wants to see me anyway. CLAUDE Please, Margot. Promise me. MARGOT Don't call me that.
F	MARGOT	Wait!
F	MARGOT	Wait! Wait!
F	MARGOT	Did you see me running out there?
M	CLAUDE	Yeah. Margot cranes her neck to see outside.
F	MARGOT	Good. That was a lot of running. I'm out of breath. Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.
