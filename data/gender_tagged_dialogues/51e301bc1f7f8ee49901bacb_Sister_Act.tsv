M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SISTER IMMACULATA	Who can name all the Apostles? Yes?
M	SISTER IMMACULATA	Christine?
M	CHRISTINE	Sister, may I be excused?
M	SISTER IMMACULATA	Christine...
M	CHRISTINE	It's an emergency. Real bad.
M	CHRISTINE	Hi, Jimmy.
M	SISTER IMMACULATA	Miss Christine Carter! Again! Don't you know what happens to girls like you? Don't you know what they become?
M	CHRISTY'S VOICE	Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.
M	VINCE'S VOICE	I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go. It was great. Like usual.
M	CHRISTY'S VOICE	It was twenty minutes. Like usual.
M	VINCE'S VOICE	The best.
M	VINCE	You are something else.
M	CHRISTY	Come on -- stay. Just a little. We can talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we'll have fun. And you still haven't told me what happened. What did she say?
M	VINCE	What did who say?
M	CHRISTY	Who? The other woman. Your wife.
M	VINCE	You are so damn sexy.
M	CHRISTY	Vince...
M	VINCE	How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
M	CHRISTY	Today was the deadline, Vince.
M	VINCE	I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession.
M	CHRISTY	You did what?
M	VINCE	For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
M	CHRISTY	You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
M	VINCE	He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	VINCE	You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
M	CHRISTY	You bastard!
M	VINCE	We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
M	CHRISTY	You pig!
M	VINCE	Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God!
M	CHRISTY	You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
M	VINCE	You're upset. I understand. I should go. I hate to.
M	CHRISTY	Get out of here! And never come back!
M	VINCE	I'll call.
M	ELVIS	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Are you lonesome tonight? Welcome to the Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible Platinum Oldies Spectacular.
F	MICHELLE	But you can't quit. What'll happen to us? Tell her she can't quit.
F	TINA	I told her. She stuck pantyhose in my mouth.
M	ELVIS	Please welcome our own girl group extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty -- the fabulous Ronelles!
M	CHRISTY	Oh, girls.
M	RONELLES	Yes, Betty?
M	CHRISTY	This prom is a real drag.
M	RONELLES	Oh-huh.
M	CHRISTY	Oh my!
M	RONELLES	What is it, Betty?
M	CHRISTY	Look at that. Get a gander.
M	RONELLES	Oh my!
M	CHRISTY	He's so dreamy. He's like... a Greek god. He's the cutest guy here. He's boss. He's fab. He's...
M	RONELLES	Yes, Betty?
M	CHRISTY	HE'S SO FINE.
M	RONELLES	D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
M	CHRISTY	WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
M	CHRISTY	Screw this dump. It's a roach motel with sequins. Every guy I meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from Des Moines.
F	MICHELLE	But what about us?
F	TINA	You taught us the act. The songs, all the moves.
M	CHRISTY	And where did it get me? I'm stuck in this rathole! You're holding me back, just like Vince! I should be headlining!
M	CHRISTY	What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost!
M	JOEY	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
M	CHRISTY	Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road.
M	JOEY	From Vince.
M	CHRISTY	His ashes?
M	JOEY	With love.
F	MICHELLE	From Vince! With love!
F	TINA	Michelle and Tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box. Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat. Michelle and Tina are impressed.
F	MICHELLE	It's a fur!
F	TINA	It's new!
M	CHRISTY	It's a bribe. Five years of my goddamned life!
F	MICHELLE	So you earned it!
F	TINA	Vince owns the casino! Cash in
M	CHRISTY	I should throw this in his facet
M	CHRISTY	Oh, Jesus. What is going on here? Why me? Whose dog did I kill?
F	MICHELLE	Hi, Lieutenant.
F	TINA	Hello, Eddie.
M	EDDIE	From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- lang.
M	CHRISTY	At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
M	EDDIE	I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each other.
M	CHRISTY	Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
M	EDDIE	So I don't shop.
M	CHRISTY	'Cause you're always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
M	EDDIE	Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker!
F	MICHELLE	Calm down, you two. It's always like this.
M	EDDIE	Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people. Vince Laflocca.
M	CHRISTY	He's a businessman.
M	EDDIE	A what? When are you qonna wake up?
M	CHRISTY	When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want -- cheap thrills?
M	EDDIE	Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
M	CHRISTY	Think again! And get out of here.
M	EDDIE	I'm going. My regards to Vince, And the Mrs.
M	EDDIE	Ladies.
M	CHRISTY	That's it! I'm not taking it from him, and I'm not taking it from Vince! From now on, it's all about me! And if I can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with it -- it's gone. Like Sister Immaculata used to say, "Life is short, and then you fry." So long, girls -- see you in church!
M	VINCE	Ernie Schmidt. How long you been with us, Ernie Schmidt?
M	ERNIE	Three years, Mr. LaRocca. One behind the bar, two as croupier.
M	VINCE	Ernie, you know what's important to me? What counts? It's not all this. This is '-- what? Frosting. Loyalty. That's me, Ernie. That's home.
M	VINCE	You ain't been loyal, Ernie. What did you tell the cops?
M	ERNIE	I didn't tell the cops anything. I swear.
M	VINCE	Joey?
M	VINCE	Who else, Ernie? Who else was in on it?
M	ERNIE	No one...
M	VINCE	Why am I wasting my time?
M	CHRISTY	Won't need that anymore. Ta-ta.
M	VINCE	Do it.
M	CHRISTY	Stuff this up your...
M	VINCE	Babe.
M	VINCE	Christy. Is there a problem? With the coat?
M	CHRISTY	No... it's fine.
M	VINCE	Yes?
M	CHRISTY	Thanks. A lot.
M	VINCE	Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
M	CHRISTY	Sure.
M	VINCE	And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
M	CHRISTY	Right. Yeah. Forgotten.
M	VINCE	That's my girl. My girl in mink. Will you be home? Soon?
M	CHRISTY	Right. I'll be... at the apartment. Call me. Thanks. Again.
M	CHRISTY	Mink. Wow.
M	JOEY	Vince -- is she... okay?
M	VINCE	Maybe.
M	WILLY	I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
M	VINCE	She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
M	JOEY	And if she runs?
M	VINCE	Take care of it.
M	JOEY	Christy? He only wants to talk to you!
M	WILLY	Christy?
M	JOEY	Christy?
M	JOEY	Come on, Christy! There's no place to go!
M	JOEY	Which way?
M	CHRISTY	Right between the eyes! Down and out! The guy was gone! I... I couldn't believe it!
M	EDDIE	You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince?
M	CHRISTY	I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
M	CLARKSON	Tough break. Whoa.
M	EDDIE	What did you expect? Vince is as dirty as they come. We've been finding bodies around here for years.
M	CHRISTY	I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me... sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing.
M	EDDIE	He didn't do you a favor.
M	CHRISTY	Screw you!
M	TATE	Come on, she'll sing great. When she sings for us.
M	CHRISTY	Sing -- like testify? Are you nuts? I just want you to protect me! You're cops!
M	TATE	Busy cops. We don't have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story. Mink coats and laundry chutes.
M	CLARKSON	Unless, of course, you're willing to testify.
M	CHRISTY	What is this, some squeeze play? Can't you just protect me without any strings?
M	EDDIE	We could put you into our witness protection program.
M	TATE	A hiding place.
M	CLARKSON	A new identity.
M	EDDIE	But you'd have to agree to testify. The whole nine yards.
M	CHRISTY	And if I don't?
M	EDDIE	Then-you run.
M	TATE	You wait.
M	CLARKSON	You listen for the footsteps.
M	EDDIE	Then one day they find you.
M	TATE	They open a window.
M	CLARKSON	It's ten flights up.
M	TATE	Ten flights down.
M	CHRISTY	Ten flights?
M	EDDIE	You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
M	CHRISTY	All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!
M	EDDIE	Get a stenographer.
M	CHRISTY	Okay, here's what I want. I know about this stuff. A five-star hotel. With room service.
M	EDDIE	Maybe Hawaii.
M	CLARKSON	Diamond Head.
M	CHRISTY	Yeah. And I'll need a new look. Like a disguise.
M	EDDIE	Maybe Armani.
M	CLARKSON	No -- Calvin Klein.
M	CHRISTY	For sportswear. And a limo. And my hair -- up?
M	CLARKSON	It could work.
M	EDDIE	Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
M	CHRISTY	Okay -- no limo.
M	EDDIE	No nothing.
M	CHRISTY	What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
M	EDDIE	I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
M	CHRISTY	I hate you. I totally hate you.
M	EDDIE	Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
M	CHRISTY	Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
M	EDDIE	It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
M	CHRISTY	With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
M	EDDIE	Vince has put out a contract on you. A hundred grand. You've seen him in action.
M	CHRISTY	But... but Vince loves me. How could he... I mean, five years...
M	EDDIE	And one bullet. That's all it's gonna take.
M	CHRISTY	But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They'll be looking for me!
M	EDDIE	Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
M	CHRISTY	I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
M	EDDIE	Pray.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.
M	O'HARA	We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life.
M	O'HARA	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
M	O'HARA	Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But, Bishop...
M	O'HARA	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I lied.
M	O'HARA	I know.
M	O'HARA	Welcome, Lieutenant. Everything is in order.
M	EDDIE	Aces. Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner?
M	CHRISTY	Hey, you're not leaving me alone...
M	O'HARA	You're never alone in this house, my child.
M	EDDIE	One month, two tops. Behave yourself.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Bishop...
M	O'HARA	Lieutenant?
M	CHRISTY	A convent? They put me in a convent? What's the problem? Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	What is your full name? Your Christian name?
M	CHRISTY	Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you understand? This is all a mistake. I'm the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm being punished!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your name?
M	CHRISTY	Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Enough joking.
M	CHRISTY	That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well.
M	CHRISTY	Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	St. Anne's?
M	CHRISTY	Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You were unhappy?
M	CHRISTY	I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The reason?
M	CHRISTY	Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I see.
M	CHRISTY	You see? You see? I have to get out of here I have to make a phone call. Don't you get it? I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sit down.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sit.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Miss Van Cartier.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cigarette -- out.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	It has come to pass.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. outfit) Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
M	CHRISTY	Are you talking about me?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And all those like you.
M	CHRISTY	You mean black people?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.
M	CHRISTY	What's a concubine?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Check your driver's license.
M	CHRISTY	Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Of course. But it's almost lunch.
M	CHRISTY	Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change
M	CHRISTY	had on since the night Deal.
M	CHRISTY (O.S.)	How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's"
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Would you like that?
M	CHRISTY (O.S.)	You should hand-wash that blouse, and send somebody out for some things. I look good in reds, purples, hot pink -- and shoes. Five-inch heels. Fuck-me pumps. Oh, man -- sorry. 'Scuse my mouth.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
M	CHRISTY (O.S.)	Can do.
M	CHRISTY	No! No! I can't do this!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
M	CHRISTY	But look at rites Look at this! I'm a nun! I'm invisible! I'm a penguin!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
M	CHRISTY	Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty...
M	CHRISTY	No problem.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The vow of obedience.
M	CHRISTY	Like to who?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And the vow of chastity.
M	CHRISTY	I'm outta here.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good afternoon, Sisters. I apologize for my tardiness. I would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes, Mary Patrick?
M	MARY PATRICK	Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
M	MARY PATRICK	As part of our welcome, I've had a little thought, just for fun. Could we have our new friend offer today's blessing?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well. Mary Clarence, rise please.
M	CHRISTY	A blessing? Like, for lunch?
M	CHRISTY	For what we are about to receive...
M	CHRISTY	may the Lord... prepare us and... watch us and... walk through the valley and be our shepherd and... to the republic for which it stands... God bless us every one, hallowed be thy name. Hallelujah. Ave Maria. Boyardee. Amen.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
M	CHRISTY	A what?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
M	CHRISTY	Silence? No talking? All day?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Until sundown.
M	CHRISTY	Oh my God.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And Mary Clarence?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
M	CHRISTY	A what?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
M	CHRISTY	No food?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	No food. Not until sundown.
M	VINCE	They grilled me for six hours in there. And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell were you?
M	LARRY	It takes time, Vince. Slow and steady. We've been through this before.
M	EDDIE	So long, Vince. See you soon.
M	VINCE	He's so damn cocky. This is different.
M	JOEY	It's a bluff, Vince.
M	VINCE	You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got.
M	LARRY	I can't hear this. I'm an attorney, Vince, and you're just an honest casino owner. Object of a witch hunt. Innocent victim.
M	VINCE	Keep the message vague, but let 'em know. The price has gone up. Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby.
M	CHRISTY	Is this all the food I get?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes. Until breakfast.
M	CHRISTY	That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
M	CHRISTY	My what?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cell. Your room.
M	CHRISTY	You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.
M	CHRISTY	Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Useless distractions.
M	CHRISTY	It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And whom would you call?
M	CHRISTY	Oh, I don't know... Satan?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cell is more than adequate.
M	CHRISTY	Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
M	CHRISTY	Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.
M	CHRISTY	What's wrong with my life?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself. God has brought you here. Take the hint.
M	MARY ROBERT (0.S.)	Sister Mary Clarence!
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MARY ROBERT	Come on, we're late.
M	CHRISTY	What? What time is it?
M	MARY ROBERT	It's after five. We have to bathe.
M	CHRISTY	Five a.m.?
M	MARY PATRICK	Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
M	CHRISTY	Right.
M	MARY ROBERT	Is this like your old convent?
M	MARY PATRICK	Which convent was that, Sister?
M	CHRISTY	Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Enough jabber.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MARY LAZARUS	Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
M	CHRISTY	Like this place?
M	MARY LAZARUS	I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a Hilton.
M	CHRISTY	MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE
M	A FEW OTHER NUNS	HEY-LA, HEY-LA
M	CHRISTY	MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION
M	A FEW OF THE NUNS	HEY-LA, HEY-LA
M	CHRISTY	IF I WERE YOU, I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION HEY-LA, HEY-LA MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
M	CHRISTY	Where did that come from?
M	MARY PATRICK	I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
M	MARY LAZARUS	Shirelles.
M	CHRISTY	You know that song?
M	MARY PATRICK	1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall.
M	CHRISTY	No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
M	ALL THE NUNS	HEY-LA, HEY LA
M	MARY LAZARUS	That's enough. We've got to get to chapel.
M	CHRISTY	Anybody got conditioner?
M	O'HARA	We are a small congregation this morning. Too many mornings. Something has gone terribly wrong. Where is faith? Where is celebration? Where is everyone? Still, rather than regret the absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present. Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on this week's selection. Sister?
M	CLARKSON	There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. this morning. The place was fencing stolen property. They found this.
M	EDDIE	Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a wonderful world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive.
M	TATE	Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?
M	EDDIE	Where's who?
M	TATE	You won't even tell us?
M	EDDIE	I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
M	MARY PATRICK	Good afternoon, young ladies. And welcome to our Christian Youth Group.
M	MARY PATRICK	Hi. I hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too. Now, today's topic is something very up-to- date -- "Teenage Promiscuity." My. Now, can anyone tell me -- just what is promiscuity?
M	MARY PATRICK	Anyone? Yes?
M	LAWANDA	Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it. A whole lot. Till your head falls off.
M	MARY PATRICK	Well, yes. That is one way to put it.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sister Mary Patrick?
M	MARY PATRICK	Yes?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
M	CHRISTY	Yeah?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood?
M	CHRISTY	I got it.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Come, Sister.
M	CHRISTY	So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about?
M	LAWANDA	We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
M	CHRISTY	Really.
M	CHARLENE	Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
M	CHRISTY	Well... yes. Yes it is.
M	LAWANDA	How come? Sister?
M	CHRISTY	Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not.
M	CHRISTY	Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
M	LAWANDA	'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
M	CHRISTY	Probation?
M	CHARLENE	Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now?
M	CHRISTY	Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
M	LAWANDA	Well, what would you know about it, anyway? What do any of you nunheads know about anything? About doin' the nasty, or gettin' high?
M	CONCHITA	Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just some ol' nun! Don't pick on no nun, it's bad luck!
M	CHRISTY	Shut up!
M	CHRISTY	Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
M	CHARLENE	What about crack? You a user?
M	CHRISTY	I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
M	KESHIA	Got you, Charlene!
M	CONCHITA	Dunked by the nun!
M	LAWANDA	Well, what about the sex stuff? What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
M	CHRISTY	And you listen to that?
M	LAWANDA	No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
M	CHRISTY	Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.
M	LAWANDA	What you do?
M	CHRISTY	Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
M	CHARLENE	But, like what if you are doin' it? What about protection? Who's responsible?
M	CONCHITA	What about them things, you know, for the guy? Aren't they like, a mess to put on? Don't they kinda mess up the mood?
M	CHRISTY	Deal with it, sweet thing. It's important, nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR (0.S.)	Mary Clarence!
M	CHRISTY	Because a banana is part of a balanced breakfast. And don't forget fiber.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
M	CHRISTY	Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
M	CHRISTY	Have you been out in those streets? Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer.
M	CHRISTY	Sometimes it's not enough!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?
M	CHRISTY	It never solves anything.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
M	CHRISTY	In English?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain."
M	VINCE	Baby, you know I do... of course... I feel it too... I'm blushing... can you hold?
M	VINCE	Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
M	WILLY	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
M	VINCE	Can you hold? Can you try?
M	VINCE	Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop's salary? Find her, and find her now!
M	VINCE	Raise the ante to three hundred grand.
M	VINCE	Sorry, baby... you are? Totally? Not a stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... inside...
M	MARY PATRICK	The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?
M	CHRISTY	Not in years.
M	MARY PATRICK	Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
M	CHRISTY	Why?
M	MARY PATRICK	To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
M	CHRISTY	But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
M	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.
M	CHRISTY	Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom.
M	MARY PATRICK	Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?
M	CHRISTY	Just about. Show me again.
M	MARY PATRICK	You betcha.
M	MARY PATRICK	Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles.
M	CHRISTY	I love my heddles. Show me again.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
M	MARY PATRICK	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
M	CHRISTY	Really catching on.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
M	CHRISTY	I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
M	CHRISTY	Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
M	CHRISTY	Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy. It's an emergency. Real bad.
M	EDDIE'S VOICE	Mulcahy.
M	CHRISTY	Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
M	EDDIE	Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
M	CHRISTY	But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!
M	EDDIE	Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
M	CHRISTY	Like what?
M	EDDIE	Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
M	CHRISTY	You son-of-a-bitch!
M	EDDIE	I just need a few more weeks,
M	CHRISTY	But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She
M	CHRISTY	Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
M	EDDIE	Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch.
M	CHRISTY	THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC...
M	CHRISTY	Yeah?
M	CHRISTY	What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?
M	MARY ROBERT	I... I...
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MARY ROBERT	I... I brought you something.
M	CHRISTY	A cigarette?
M	MARY ROBERT	An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard.
M	CHRISTY	Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
M	CHRISTY	Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.
M	CHRISTY	So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
M	MARY ROBERT	Three years. Sister.
M	CHRISTY	Three years. A rookie.
M	MARY ROBERT	A novice.
M	CHRISTY	Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?
M	CHRISTY	Whoa! Bob! What's going on here? What'd I say?
M	MARY ROBERT	You have to help me Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.
M	MARY ROBERT	No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
M	CHRISTY	Excuse me?
M	MARY ROBERT	Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
M	CHRISTY	She won't? Why not?
M	MARY ROBERT	She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
M	CHRISTY	She said that? Reverend Mother?
M	CHRISTY	Well, then there's only one thing to do.
M	MARY ROBERT	What?
M	CHRISTY	Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.
M	CHRISTY	Must I do this thing, 0 Lord? Please help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my selfish cares aside... I must think of others... yes, she's here... He says hi... yes, I understand... let thy will be done. Amen. You too.
M	CHRISTY	We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
M	MARY ROBERT	Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
M	CHRISTY	We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.
M	MARY ROBERT	Are you sure?
M	CHRISTY	We hear you.
M	MARY ROBERT	Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind?
M	CHRISTY	I know it is. It's life. Experience. Take a deep breath.
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
M	CHRISTY	Now you.
M	CHRISTY	It's a start.
M	CHRISTY	How are you doing.
M	LAWANDA	Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
M	CHRISTY	You know it.
M	MARY ROBERT	We need experience.
M	CHRISTY	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over.
M	CHRISTY	And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
M	CHRISTY	Bobs
M	MARY ROBERT	Experience! Right?
M	CHRISTY	Right.
M	CHRISTY	A couple of bowls of chili. And another round of these.
M	MARY ROBERT	I have to do this. So I can become a nun.
M	CHRISTY	Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
M	MARY ROBERT	Really?
M	CHRISTY	And she wants to be a nun.
M	MARY ROBERT	Who are all these people?
M	CHRISTY	This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
M	DUDE	Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?
M	CHRISTY	Better now.
M	DUDE	How come they let you out? Out of that convent place?
M	CHRISTY	Time off. For bad behavior.
M	DUDE	Oww! A nun havin' fun! I don't believe it! It's good to have you ladies in this fine establishment. So... anybody on the move?
M	MARY ROBERT	I am.
M	CHRISTY	Bob! What're you doing?
M	MARY ROBERT	I'm getting experience.
M	CHRISTY	You watch yourself! Do it, Sisters!
M	CLUB PATRON #2	Sway and pray!
M	MARY ROBERT	Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?
M	CHRISTY	Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front.
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
M	CHRISTY	Honey.
M	MARY ROBERT	I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
M	CHRISTY	Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk.
M	CHRISTY	Run!
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
M	CHRISTY	Keep moving!
M	CHRISTY	Climb! Now!
M	CHRISTY	Goddamn it!
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
M	MARY ROBERT	Oh my Lord!
M	CHRISTY	Experience!
M	MARY ROBERT	What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
M	CHRISTY	I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
M	MARY ROBERT	We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes -- thank you so much.
M	CHRISTY	What'd she say?
M	EDDIE	You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.
M	CHRISTY	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
M	EDDIE	She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
M	CHRISTY	So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
M	EDDIE	Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. Go.
M	CHRISTY	So... hi there.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
M	CHRISTY	Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
M	CHRISTY	I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.
M	CHRISTY	A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
M	CHRISTY	But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
M	CHRISTY	I am?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir. You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
M	CHRISTY	No. No.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You're my Olympic event.
M	CHRISTY	Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir -- I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold.
M	CHRISTY	Is this... choir practice?
M	MARY PATRICK	Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
M	CHRISTY	Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
M	MARY ROBERT	Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Soprano or alto?
M	CHRISTY	Whatever.
M	JOEY	We're looking for Mike.
M	MIKE	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
M	MIKE	Hey -- the till's empty!
M	JOEY	I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
M	MIKE	Who are you guys?
M	JOEY	We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting.
M	MIKE	But you didn't tell me!
M	JOEY	We didn't tell you what?
M	MIKE	That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
M	WILLY	What? Christy?
M	JOEY	A nun?
M	MIKE	I'm telling you!
M	WILLY	Gimme a hand here.
M	JOEY	A nun!
M	MARY LAZARUS	Mary Clarence, are you with us?
M	CHRISTY	Um, I don't really know this one...
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
M	MARY PATRICK	Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress?
M	CHRISTY	Sure. Kind of... free-lance.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Free-lance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MARY LAZARUS	You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.
M	CHRISTY	Hold on.
M	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us?
M	ANOTHER NUN	Please?
M	ANOTHER NUN	You've heard us.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Well.
M	MARY LAZARUS	There's a word for this -- mutiny. So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do better. I believe I'd like to see that. I'm out to pasture. Dry dock. The glue factory. Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em sing.
M	CHRISTY	Well... With all due respect... let's have a look at this.
M	CHRISTY	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
M	CHRISTY	Man. I sound like you guys.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to.
M	CHRISTY	Mary Robert.
M	MARY ROBERT	What?
M	CHRISTY	Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.
M	MARY ROBERT	I don't want to mess anyone up...
M	CHRISTY	Give me a C. A C!
M	CHRISTY	Louder! Like you're onstage.
M	CHRISTY	Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you.
M	CHRISTY	Think about that guy you were dancing with!
M	MARY ROBERT	Oh my!
M	CHRISTY	You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
M	MARY PATRICK	Chops?
M	CHRISTY	The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
M	CHRISTY	Sister Alma -- a C.
M	CHRISTY	Middle section, hold that note, for dear life. Sopranos, an A. Sister Alma?
M	MARY PATRICK	We did it! We actually sang a chord!
M	MARY ROBERT	That was exciting!
M	CHRISTY	Yeah, for one second. That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. Be a group.
M	MARY LAZARUS	I knew that.
M	CHRISTY	Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
M	CHRISTY	I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
M	MARY PATRICK	Two days. An hour or so.
M	CHRISTY	No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day.
M	MARY LAZARUS	She's good.
M	MARY ROBERT	Do you really think we could do it? Get better?
M	CHRISTY	I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Wet behind the ears.
M	CHRISTY	A bunch of real mama's girls.
M	MARY PATRICK	Oh, please? Can't we try?
M	CHRISTY	It'll be hell.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Tell me about it.
M	CHRISTY	Ten-hut!
M	CHRISTY	That machine.
M	MARY PATRICK	I know. It's ancient.
M	CHRISTY	It's a rhythm section. The beat.
M	CHRISTY	Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
M	MARY PATRICK	The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
M	CHRISTY	Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
M	MARY PATRICK	Am I?
M	MARY PATRICK	All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
M	CHRISTY	So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.
M	MARY PATRICK	SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
M	CHRISTY	Because we're GOING TO THE CHAPEL GOING TO THE CHAPEL GOING TO THE CHAPEL AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
M	MARY PATRICK	GOING TO THE CHAPEL OF LOVE!
M	NUNS	Good morning, Reverend Mother.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good morning, Sisters. GOING TO THE CHAPEL...
M	BISHOP O'HARA	Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few and faithful.
M	BISHOP O'HARA	The choir, I am told, has elected a new director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who will lead them in Hymn 127.
M	CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
M	CHRISTY	One, two, three...
M	CHOIR	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
M	CHRISTY	What you say?
M	CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
M	CHRISTY	But how?
M	CHOIR	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
M	CHRISTY	I think I hear it! LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
M	CHRISTY	You know, I just might!
M	CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY!
M	CHRISTY AND CHOIR	LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS
M	CHRISTY	Sister Alma!
M	CHRISTY	Mary Robert!
M	MARY ROBERT	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY SOUL TAKE WING AND FLY!
M	CHOIR	LET THY SPIRIT
M	CHRISTY	You know what we're saying!
M	CHOIR	LET THY SPIRIT
M	CHRISTY	I think they hear you!
M	MARY LAZARUS	LET THY SPIRIT LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLYI
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Gospel. A jazz solo on the organ. What next? Jesus goes to Rio? Good Friday-a- go-go? What were you thinking?
M	CHRISTY	I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
M	CHRISTY	Exactly. People like going to theaters and casinos. But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir!
M	CHRISTY	Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Out of the question.
M	CHRISTY	Please let me try. I'm begging you.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
M	BISHOP O'HARA	Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Oh?
M	BISHOP O'HARA	I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Well... thank you.
M	BISHOP O'HARA	I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Perhaps.
M	BISHOP O'HARA	I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really?
M	CHRISTY	Excuse me, Bishop. Reverend Mother has some other ideas too. She's too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more. This woman.
M	MARY PATRICK	Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really...
M	CHRISTY	You know Reverend Mother. Hides her light under a bushel. She has plans for us to move right onto the streets. Get to know people. Work with 'em.
M	BISHOP O'HARA	You're a pioneer.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
M	O'HARA	And you'll face that danger head-on. As if I could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
M	CHRISTY	Don't you love her?
M	CHRISTY	WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
M	MARY ROBERT	HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
M	MARY PATRICK	BELIEVE IN THE LORD, HIS WILL BE DONE COME TO CHURCH, IT'S TONS OF FUN
M	MARY LAZARUS	DIG DOWN DEEP, GIVE ALL YOU CAN TRUST ME, CHILDREN, THERE'S A HEAVENLY PLAN!
M	CHRISTY	Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again!
M	MARY LAZARUS	Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
M	CHRISTY	Hopeless I
M	MARY LAZARUS	Amateurs 2
M	CHRISTY	Babies
M	MARY LAZARUS	Again!
M	CHRISTY	We're here to pray for you, brother.
M	DEALER	What? Get the hell out of here.
M	CHRISTY	We know you don't want to sell drugs. You just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability. You just need someone to pray for you.
M	MARY PATRICK	We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
M	CHRISTY	And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers.
M	DRIVER	What is this? Outta my way!
M	CHRISTY	Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
M	MARY ROBERT	We're nuns!
M	MARY PATRICK	Free prayers right over here! Drive up and get your prayers!
M	DEALER	You're hassling my customers! That's not legal! I know my rights. This is restriction of trade.
M	CHRISTY	You wanna call a cop?
M	MARY PATRICK	Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
M	MARY LAZARUS	Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses here.
M	CHRISTY	Can I get a witness?
M	DEALER	So I'll find another neighborhood to do my business. You can' t stop me.
M	CHRISTY	If we can stop you here, they can stop you there.
M	NEWS REPORTER (V.0.)	It was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.
F	CONNIE	Vinnie, get in here. You gotta see this!
M	VINCE	What? Nuns? You got me in here to see nuns? Isn't there a ball game on or something?
F	CONNIE	Look -- she's adorable!
M	NEWS REPORTER	This tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround. The sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a group led by this gifted young nun. Tell us, Mary Clarence1 what makes you so special?
M	CHRISTY	Oh, I'm not special, Bob. It's just hard work... and prayer.
M	CHRISTY	Eddie! You scared the hell out of me!
M	EDDIE	What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
M	CHRISTY	It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.
M	EDDIE	You're supposed to be hiding out!
M	CHRISTY	I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do.
M	EDDIE	Listen to yourself. This isn't a career opportunity.
M	CHRISTY	I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them.
M	EDDIE	Jesus, look at you You're glowing.
M	CHRISTY	I am?
M	EDDIE	Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..
M	CHRISTY	Really? Lieutenant?
M	EDDIE	I've been worried about you.
M	CHRISTY	You mean -- worried about my testimony?
M	EDDIE	No -- worried about you. Personally.
M	CHRISTY	Well.. thanks. I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes. I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
M	EDDIE	Me too.
M	CHRISTY	You're not... seeing anybody?
M	EDDIE	No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.
M	CHRISTY	I have?
M	EDDIE	You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different...
M	EDDIE	You're... you're a nun.
M	CHRISTY	We're in a convent!
M	CHRISTY	I've got to go.
M	EDDIE	Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
M	CHRISTY	I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.
M	CHRISTY	Magic time!
M	CHRISTY	This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene. You know the one. Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past. She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to practically everybody. Many condemned her. The whole neighborhood. But one man refused to do so. One man said, hey now, wait a minute. Listen to the story.
M	CHRISTY	Hey, girls.
M	MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Hail, Mary.
M	CHRISTY	Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.
M	MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Oh-huh.
M	CHRISTY	People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.
M	MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Really.
M	CHRISTY	But -- wait.
M	MARY PATRICK	What is it, Mary?
M	CHRISTY	That man -- who is he?
M	MARY ROBERT	He's a carpenter.
M	MARY PATRICK	He's not like other guys.
M	MARY ROBERT	He's decent.
M	MARY PATRICK	He's kind.
M	CHRISTY	He's... dreamy. He's...
M	CHOIR	Yes, Mary? HE'S SO FINE...
M	CHOIR	DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG.
M	CHRISTY/MARY ROBERT/ MARY PATRICK	WISH HE WAS MINE THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR
M	CHRISTY	Jackpot! Two buckets
M	MARY PATRICK	This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
M	MARY ROBERT	I'd rather sing than do anything!
M	MARY PATRICK	It's better than ice cream.
M	MARY ROBERT	It's better than springtime.
M	CHRISTY	It's better than sex!
M	CHRISTY	I imagine.
M	O'HARA	Better and better, Sisters, you are truly an inspiration. And I bear gladsome tidings.
M	O'HARA	I've kept the Cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood. He has been most impressed. And he has invited you to attend a special evening Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 to sing for the Council of Cardinals.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We will be honored to appear.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)	And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
M	CHRISTY	What do you mean?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
M	MARY PATRICK	But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
M	MARY ROBERT	It's brought people back to the church.
M	CHRISTY	Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
M	CHRISTY	A vote?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
M	CHRISTY	But... wait a minute...
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The majority has spoken.
M	BISHOP O'HARA	Reverend Mother, as always, you are a true leader. Gracious and understanding.
M	MARY ROBERT	It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother. You'll see.
M	MARY LAZARUS	She's a pro.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I am certain the presentation will be a great success. Congratulations, Mary Clarence. And congratulations to you all.
M	CHRISTY	You sent for me?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have a phone call.
M	CHRISTY	Hello?
M	EDDIE'S VOICE	Good news, kid. I pulled a few strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up. We'll be in court in a couple of days.
M	CHRISTY	That soon?
M	EDDIE'S VOICE	Forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a free woman.
M	CHRISTY	Great. That's good to hear.
M	EDDIE'S VOICE	Hey, don't thank me or anything.
M	CHRISTY	Right, right -- thanks.
M	CHRISTY	Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really. Well, that makes two of us.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
M	CHRISTY	But -- why?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I must go where I can be of use.
M	CHRISTY	But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
M	CHRISTY	But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)	You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
M	CHRISTY	Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.
M	CHRISTY	But...
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good day.
M	CHRISTY'S VOICE	Come on... I've got a surprise...
M	MARY ROBERT	Ice cream!
M	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
M	MARY LAZARUS	It's a sin. It's a wicked indulgence. Is this butter almond?
M	CHRISTY	It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift.
M	MARY ROBERT	A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Is there any syrup?
M	CHRISTY	Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
M	MARY PATRICK	Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
M	MARY LAZARUS	We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
M	CHRISTY	That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
M	MARY ROBERT	Are you leaving us?
M	CHRISTY	Oh no. We'll always be together.
M	MARY LAZARUS	That's what Diana Ross said.
M	TATE	You're too late. Mulcahy just left.
M	PARKER	I need his signature on some things. They can't be processed without it.
M	TATE	Leave 'em. He'll sign 'em later.
M	TATE	What the hell is this...?
M	PARKER	Tate said you were gone.
M	EDDIE	I get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys?
M	PARKER	I left the money vouchers with him. He said you'd sign them in the morning.
M	VINCE	This is it. Get ready to move. No mistakes. Grab her, get her to the Moonlight. We meet there, and we take care of her. We're on it. Give me the address.
M	TATE	St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. It's gotta be the place.
M	EDDIE	You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!
M	EDDIE	Get him out of here! Downstairs, in the cell! I want his ass locked up now!
M	EDDIE	Clarkson, get on the other line. Call Frisco Central. Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place.
M	MARY ROBERT	The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words?
M	CHRISTY	Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus?
M	MARY PATRICK	It should be here any minute.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp.
M	EDDIE	Reverend Mother! Quick! Where's Christy?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	What's wrong?
M	EDDIE	They know she's here! They're on their way!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The rehearsal room!
M	MARY ROBERT	It's here! Let's go!
M	MARY PATRICK	Hurry, Sister!
M	CHRISTY	Get moving. I'm right behind you.
M	CHRISTY	Eddie...?
M	EDDIE	Vince knows you're here.
M	CHRISTY	How?
M	EDDIE	Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here '- now!
M	CHRISTY	I can't go with you.
M	EDDIE	What?
M	CHRISTY	I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals.
M	EDDIE	You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
M	MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence! Sister!
M	MARY ROBERT	It's no use. She just isn't here.
M	MARY PATRICK	It doesn't make any sense. She was right behind me...
M	MARY ROBERT	We can't sing without her! What should we do?
M	MARY PATRICK	We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
M	CHRISTY	Eddie -- I've got to go back. They won't sing without me. I'm deserting them.
M	EDDIE	I think they'd understand.
M	CHRISTY	That's not the point! They need me!
M	EDDIE	They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips?
M	CHRISTY	You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
M	EDDIE	Nuns?
M	CHRISTY	They're not nuns. They're like.. people. With one outfit.
M	JOEY	So that guy in the bar was right? She's like... some kind of nun?
M	WILLY	Yeah, right -- when I see it.
M	LAWANDA	You dudes looking for nuns? They all went to St. Matthew's.
M	JOEY	St, Matthew's? Thanks.
M	LAWANDA	Praise the Lord.
M	EDDIE	What're you doing?
M	CHRISTY	Even nuns have to pee.
M	CHRISTY	Okay, it's me. Mary Clarence. Christy. It's Chris Carter. I need some help here. I can't believe I'm doing this. Okay, look, I know I should just get back in the car, and get the hell out of here. Save my skin. I mean, it's not wrong, Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you make guys like Vince? But if I don't sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert. Mary Patrick. It means so much to them. They're counting on me -- and I like that. Maybe Reverend Mother is right, maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a deal here? I mean, I still don't believe in, like, most of the Commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if I do a good deed, will you promise I won't get killed? All I want is a sign. Lightning. Thunder. Anything.
M	CHRISTY	No. No. Doesn't count...
M	CHRISTY	Oh my God...
M	CHRISTY	I'm late for church. Can I get a lift?
M	CARDINAL	Is this the choir you've been speaking so highly of, Bishop?
M	O'HARA	They're just a bit nervous. They'll be fine.
M	MARY PATRICK	We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence.
M	MARY LAZARUS	We're losing it.
M	MARY ROBERT	I don't understand. Where is she?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.
M	FLOOR DIRECTOR	Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. That was great, just great. Charlie, throw a spot on the pulpit. Let's get a balance.
M	MARY ROBERT	You're here! Thank goodness!
M	CHRISTY	Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?
M	JOEY	The rehearsal room is right this way.
M	MARY ROBERT	Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
M	CHRISTY	They're from my old convent.
M	CHRISTY	Run! Take off!
M	MARY ROBERT	Again?
M	WILLY	Go!
M	MARY ROBERT	But what do they want? Where are we going?
M	CHRISTY	She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.
M	JOEY	Yeah, right to the cops. No way.
M	CHRISTY	Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
M	JOEY	What?
M	CHRISTY	You can handle this.
M	CHRISTY	Go!
M	JOEY	She's gettin' away!
M	WILLY	Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it!
M	MARY PATRICK	You mean -- they kidnapped her?
M	MARY ROBERT	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
M	MARY PATRICK	But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
M	MARY LAZARUS	Were they Catholics?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	She isn't a nun. Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer. She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent.
M	MARY ROBERT	An... entertainer?
M	MARY PATRICK	She wasn't a nun?
M	ANOTHER NUN	She lied to us?
M	MARY ROBERT	But... but... she was such a wonderful nun.
M	MARY PATRICK	Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
M	MARY LAZARUS	That should have tipped us.
M	MARY ROBERT	Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her!
M	MARY PATRICK	She's our inspiration!
M	MARY LAZARUS	She's the act!
M	MARY ROBERT	Reverend Mother, I know that you and Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but -- we've got to help her.
M	MARY PATRICK	We've got to save her!
M	MARY LAZARUS	We can't leave it up to the Feds!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
M	MARY ROBERT	She said they were from her old convent.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
M	MARY PATRICK	She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell him the situation. Everyone else -- follow me.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Emergency! Open up!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	The San Francisco airport! Immediately!
M	MARY LAZARUS	Step on it!
M	EDDIE	Where is she?
M	O'HARA	There was a kidnapping. We think Las Vegas.
M	MANAGER	Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas. Rock-bottom.
M	MARY PATRICK	But we don't have fifteen hundred!
M	MARY ROBERT	We're nuns!
M	MANAGER	Can't help you. No exceptions.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Young man!
M	MANAGER	What?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	We are nuns. We pray.
M	MANAGER	So?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	We pray for good things. Food for the hungry.
M	MARY PATRICK	Peace on Earth.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	However, we can also pray for other things.
M	MARY PATRICK	Measles.
M	MARY ROBERT	Lawsuits.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Tax audits.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel. Bring your beads.
M	MANAGER	Wait!
M	JOEY	We got her.
M	VINCE	Babe.
M	VINCE	Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
M	CHRISTY	Good evening, Vincent.
M	VINCE	What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
M	CHRISTY	I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
M	WILLY	She's a nun, Vince.
M	VINCE	I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love?
M	CHRISTY	You will be judged, Vincent. We all will.
M	VINCE	What do you mean -- judged? I don't get judged, baby. And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind.
M	WILLY	She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up.
M	JOEY	It's spooky. It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing.
M	VINCE	She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
M	CHRISTY	I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you.
M	VINCE	Who gives a damn? Waste her.
M	MARY PATRICK	It's so beautiful...
M	MARY ROBERT	And what a lovely name. Las Vegas...
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	And Gommorah.
M	VINCE	It's done?
M	JOEY	Not... totally.
M	VINCE	What's the problem?
M	WILLY	She's... she's a nun.
M	VINCE	Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe!
M	JOEY	But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
M	VINCE	It didn't happen.
M	WILLY	She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
M	JOEY	No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
M	VINCE	I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
M	JOEY	Yeah...
M	WILLY	Right. That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first. It could always be the other guy.
M	JOEY	Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three we both shoot. Got it?
M	WILLY	Got it.
M	JOEY	One... two...
M	JOEY	Three!
M	JOEY	You didn't shoot!
M	WILLY	Neither did you!
M	JOEY	I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
M	WILLY	That's what I figured, too.
M	MARY ROBERT	Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	But where?
M	MARY PATRICK	Look! There she is!
M	MARY ROBERT	The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
M	MARY PATRICK	But how do we get there?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Stand back. Taxi!
M	VINCE	Well?
M	JOEY	It didn't work, Vince.
M	VINCE	You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
M	WILLY	We both missed.
M	VINCE	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
M	JOEY	Right.
M	VINCE	So, take it off.
M	WILLY	Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?
M	JOEY	For like, twelve zillion eternities?
M	VINCE	I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in
M	JOEY	Maybe pants.
M	WILLY	A sweater.
M	JOEY	And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye. Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight
M	CLARKSON	Lieutenant!
M	WILLY	We got it all worked out.
M	JOEY	Okay, Christy -- strip.
M	CHRISTY	What?
M	JOEY	That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.
M	WILLY	What's she doing?
M	JOEY	She's praying.
M	CHRISTY	And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only trying to do their jobs. Pox fibula tibia vobiscum. Et marcus domino's pizza. Have mercy. Amen. I'm finished now. Help me up.
M	JOEY	There she goes! she's taking the stairs I They run quickly after her.
M	JOEY	Find Vince and tell him what happened. I'll take this side of the room.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Brace yourselves, Sisters.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. Try to blend in.
M	MARY PATRICK	Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
M	MARY ROBERT	A Benedictine.
M	CROUPIER	Place your bets.
M	CHRISTY	Red 21.
M	SALESMAN	You sure? How do you know?
M	SALESMAN	Red 21.
M	CROUPIER	Black 14.
M	CHRISTY	Did you learn something?
M	EDDIE	Close off the block, but don't move in till I tell you.
M	CHRISTY	What are you doing here?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Saving you. Move!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Break!
M	VINCE	Get her!
M	JOEY	Which one!
M	VINCE	The nun!
M	VINCE	Babe.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sweetheart.
M	EDDIE	Move in. Seal off the exits, but don't come inside till I tell you.
M	WILLY	There's nuns everywhere! Hundreds of 'em!
M	VINCE	There she is!
M	JOEY	Which one?
M	CHRISTY	Quick, there's another way out of here. Follow me.
M	VINCE	She's heading for the lounge! Go!
M	EDDIE	Move in -- now!
M	JOEY	I can't see anything in here!
M	VINCE	Willy -- hit the lights.
M	WILLY	Where?
M	VINCE	Find 'em!
M	JOEY	There! flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room.
M	VINCE	No -- there!
M	JOEY	Over there!
M	VINCE	Freeze! Everybody!
M	VINCE	Joey?
M	JOEY	Where is she?
M	CHRISTY	Right here. Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
M	VINCE	Joey -- do it.
M	JOEY	But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
M	VINCE	She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad!
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I guarantee you, she is no broad. She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine's Convent. She is a model of generosity, virtue and love. You have my word, gentlemen. She is a nun.
M	WILLY	Hear that? Now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her?
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
M	MARY PATRICK	Christy.
M	MARY LAZARUS	Van Cartier.
M	CHRISTY	You know? About me? About everything?
M	CHRISTY	Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Oh?
M	CHRISTY	You saved my life.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm a Christian.
M	EDDIE	Don't you have a concert to go to?
M	CHRISTY	That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
M	MARY ROBERT	Not a note.
M	MARY PATRICK	Impossible.
M	CHRISTY	Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thank-you.
M	CHRISTY	Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
M	EDDIE	I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
M	CHRISTY	Yeah, like what?
M	VINCE	I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
M	CHRISTY	That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Real--different. I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are...
M	MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
M	CHRISTY	Bless you.
M	MARY PATRICK	I just realized -- this is the last time we'll all be together. We're going to miss you so much.
M	CHRISTY	Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
M	MARY LAZARUS	You re okay -- for a civilian.
M	MARY ROBERT	Reverend Mother?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes?
M	MARY ROBERT	Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows?
M	CHRISTY	I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.
M	CHRISTY	What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz.
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
M	CHRISTY	Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
M	MOTHER SUPERIOR	Don't push it.
M	MARY ROBERT	I WAS DOWNHEARTED
M	CHRISTY	It's true!
M	MARY ROBERT	I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
M	CHRISTY	Don't you know it!
M	MARY ROBERT	BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
M	CHRISTY	What did He say?
M	MARY ROBERT	HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
M	MARY PATRICK	MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
M	CHRISTY	It's true -- I know her.
M	MARY PATRICK	DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
M	CHRISTY	What a shame!
M	MARY PATRICK	WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
M	CHRISTY	Pay attention...
M	MARY PATRICK	SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
M	CHRISTY	Were you wicked?
M	CHOIR	SING!
M	CHRISTY	Were you tempted?
M	CHOIR	SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
M	CHRISTY	But I'm fearful!
M	CHOIR	SING!
M	CHRISTY	And I'm tearful!
M	CHOIR	SING!
M	CHRISTY	YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
M	CHRISTY/CHOIR	DO YOUR TROUBLES BIND YOU IF YOO'RE DEEP IN WOE YOU CAN BANISH GLOOM IF YOU TRY FIND A SONG WITHIN YOU LET IT FILL YOUR DAYS JUST SING SING!
M	CHOIR	JUST SING!
M	MARY PATRICK	SING!
M	MARY LAZARUS	JUST SING!
M	CHRISTY	Sing!
M	CHRISTY/CHOIR	SING AND SAY DEVIL, GOODBYE!
