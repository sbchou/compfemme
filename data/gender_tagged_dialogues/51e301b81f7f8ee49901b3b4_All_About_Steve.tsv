M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MARY (V.O.)	Vita aenigma est. Life is a puzzle. It is. Specifically, life is most like a crossword puzzle. There are a million reasons why, not the least of which is that life, like crosswords, requires the use of your whole entire brain- Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills
F	MARY	Crap. The puzzle answers all run together. In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best
F	MARY	Four letter word for... vomit. She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help.
F	MARY	Not "barf". For sure not "barf". That's too easy. "Puke" is okay, but maybe a bit pedestrian (that means boring)... I like "hurl". I do. I like the way it rolls off your tongue -- the word, I mean. But my all time favorite is none of those. She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it
F	MARY	Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E- W. Spew... Sp-ew. A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals
M	TEACHER	We're ready for you now. bag).
F	MARY	Jesus help me. The Teacher reads from her notes.
M	TEACHER	Here's a treat, students. Our final guest for Career Day, Miss Mary Horowitz, is the crossword constructor for the Atlanta Citizen. You know the crossword puzzles you see every week in the newspaper? It's her job to create them. Isn't that fun? Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers.
F	MARY	You weren't supposed to tell them.
M	TEACHER	Pardon me?
F	MARY	I made a crossword puzzle to help them guess what my job is. You ruined it.
M	TEACHER	Oh, I'm so sorry. Mary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at
M	TEACHER	Maybe you could tell them a bit about what your job is like? watche s hit

F	MARY	People do crossword puzzles all the time but they don't often think of the person who made all the words fit together, and who thought up the clues, and who made sure the little black squares at the top mirror the ones at the bottom. She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds
F	MARY	Crossword constructors usually have above average intelligence, with knowledge of just about every subject you can imagine. And it helps if they can spell. The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody
F	MARY	Imagine, for a moment, a world without crossword puzzles. A world- Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her
M	TEACHER	Daniel, you have a question?
M	DANIEL	You make a living doing that? Just making puzzles? The Atlanta Citizen only comes out on Fridays. One puzzle a week can't make you enough to live on. A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up.
M	LARGE KID	How do you pay your rent?
F	MARY	My parents -
M	DANIEL	You live with your parents? The Kids all laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at
M	LARGE KID	Oh my God, how old are you? Still living at home! The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic.
M	TEACHER	Children! The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary
M	TEACHER	Are you okay? Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak.
F	MARY	Water.
M	TEACHER	Water. Just hang on. The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary.
F	MARY	Yep, I live at home... She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it.
F	MARY	But so do all of you, so there... And sure, I only create one crossword puzzle a week but I have deadlines, I have stress, I have demands on me so huge you would not believe. The newspaper business is hell. I mean it. Hell. Somebody's got to write about all the horrors that go on in this world. And after people read about those horrors, somebody else has to bring them back from the brink of suicide. Who do you think that is? She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than
F	MARY	Me! My crossword puzzle is always good news. it enlightens. it r andma's entertains. It keeps your g mind alive so she remembers to send you five bucks on your birthday. Think about that as you lie in bed tonight picking your nose and crying yourself to sleep. I know I will. The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's
F	MARY	My job matters, you know. In media circles I am, as the Dutch say, geliefd. That means I have plenty of friends. Hoards, in fact. Scads even. The kids aren't buying it.
M	LARGE KID	You're a freak. The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated. Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile.
F	MARY	That's a pretty blouse. The Teacher smiles back. Awkward.
F	MARY	Twelve letter phrase for smashing success! She heads down the walkway toward the bus stop.
F	MARY	As one would say in old Paris... Coup de maitre! A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on
F	MARY	It means "master stroke", even though the direct translation is actually "master blow"... Leave it to the French to pass off an unpleasant slave activity as an everyday expression. The Custodian doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
F	MARY	I sometimes suffer from benign positional vertigo. Could you please not drive until I'm - f He ignores her, starts driving. Mary struggles toward the goes.
F	MARY	Excuse me... pardonnez-moi... begnadiyen sie mich... She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her
F	MARY	Hello hematoma. She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her. In crosswords, as in life, some days are harder than others. It's true. In the New York Times, for example, the puzzles get harder as the week goes. So on Monday, a day that traditionally bites the big one, the crossword is super easy. It's comforting to know that although life can be difficult at times, crosswords let you off easy when you need it the most. Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other 40ish granddaughter BETTY selling magazines, ne smokes and Pocky. In the corner of the newsstand, a muted TV features CNN He ignores her. Mary hands the papers to Betty.
F	MARY	Hi Betty. Betty just rings up the papers.
F	MARY	Did you see the review of "Hairspray" in the Journal yesterday? They used the word "spectacular" -- always a good sign. Maybe you'd like to go see it with rne? I have a coupon for five dollars off. Betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter, points
M	BETTY	Nine dollar twenty. Mary fishes in her bag for money.
F	MARY	We could bring your dad if you want. I don't think the show is ageist. That means he won't feel like a loser for being old. As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures
M	BETTY	Pecha kucha! Do Itta! Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next
F	MARY	So no then? That's a no? Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her
M	MARY (V.O.)	Sometimes crosswords are even better than life. Here's how. They don't discriminate. Crosswords don't care if you're young or old; black or white; male, female or intersex. Crosswords only care if you're an idiot. And, really, that's okay, because if you have the IQ of a yam, finishing a crossword should be the least of your worries. Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then walks away. PRODUCERS, SOUNDyT all in a mad rush to go get An unshaven and surprisingly calm STEVE balances camera Steve heads to an open van where a disheveled, mid
M	ANGUS	Where the hell is he?
M	STEVE	Probably doing his nails. -- paper 40ish reporter HARTMAN HUGHES rushes to the van on his face.
M	HARTMAN	What do you mean "the big one"? Terrorists, natural disaster, what?
M	ANGUS	Pandemic. Hartman's eyes light up.
M	ANGUS	Half of the Midwest and spreading. Nobody's safe. Steve tries on a gas mask.
M	HARTMAN	Please let it be the bird flu.
M	STEVE	Bird flu is for pussies. This thing's unstoppable.
M	HARTMAN	How's it spreading? Angus looks at Steve.
M	STEVE	Squirrels. Hartman can barely contain his excitement.
M	HARTMAN	Oh my God, they're everywhere!
M	STEVE	Exactly.
M	HARTMAN	Al Qaeda connection?
M	ANGUS	Always a possibility.
M	STEVE	Who wishes he was in Iraq now?
M	HARTMAN	Not me!. Hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the van's side mirror.
M	HARTMAN	I need blush. No, wait. I'll go pasty. It'll look like I could be the first media victim. "Hartman Hughes, no such thing as too close to the story". Hartman looks back at Steve and Angus. They're just standing
M	HARTMAN	Assholes! I knew it was too good to be true. He throws his gas mask down, storms off.
M	ANGUS	Hartman, come on. Hartman gets in the elevator, hollers out to them.
M	HARTMAN	I had a perfectly good bologna sandwich going on upstairs. Wasted! Angus and Steve watch the elevator door close, shrug it off.
M	STEVE	Next E-coli story breaks, he'll be fine. Face still in the newspaper, Mary trips up the steps and
F	MARY	Crap. Mary steps out of her boots and marches into the living room
F	MARY	"Brilliant" is what they said. Never in the history of St. Margaret's Career Day have the children's brains been so inordinately stimulated as they were today by my presentation.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Good for you, sweetie. Mary pulls the newspapers out of her bag, sorts through them,
F	MARY	"Inspired", the teacher told me.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	You get the Post? She hands him the paper.
F	MARY	"Engrossing" one child exclaimed.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	A ten year old said that?
F	MARY	I'm sure that's what he meant. And "ebullient"-
F	MR. HOROWITZ	What happened to your knee? Mary looks down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto
F	MARY	Dad, some of the greatest orators of all time had their heads chopped off for their labors. I'm lucky to escape with a simple flesh wound. Mary hands over the last newspaper, heads out to the hallway.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Change those socks before your date.
F	MARY	I told you I'm not going.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Mrs. Alchessi says you'll like this one.
F	MARY	Mrs. Alchessi has gliomatosis cerebri.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	What?
F	MARY	A brain tumor characterized by, among other things, dementia. She's nuts. Mary walks up the stairs.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Mary, it's just a date. This is what normal girls your age do. Mary stops on the stairs.
F	MARY	I'm normal. Silence from her parents. Mary marches back into the living
F	MARY	In fact, I'm normalis extremes. That's the kind of normal that doesn't get more normal.
M	MRS. HANCOCK	Of course you are, sweetie. Mary looks at her obviously lying mother and uncomfortable
F	MARY	I'll go. Mary bolts up the stairs to her room. Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz look at each other, surprised, happy.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	You ever want to see grandchildren, you better burn the damn boots. She swats him with her book, tries not to laugh. On the dresser, a bunch of photos of Mary Tyler Moore in the - MTM in a wears the exact same outfit. Oddly, surprisingly current and actually hot. She leans over the gerbil cage next to her desk, taps to wake
F	MARY	Carol, tonight I have a date. A blind one. Not the guy, I mean the situation. We are, as yet, unknown to one another... It's nerve wracking, I know. Try not to have a spontaneous epileptiform seizure. The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a There's a knock on her bedroom door. Mary folds up the bag,
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Guess who's here.
F	MARY	I'd rather not. Mrs. Horowitz opens the door wider, takes a look at Mary,
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Look at you.
F	MARY	i already did. Repeatedly.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	You're beautiful.
F	MARY	Please don't mean on the inside.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Beautiful and smart. And fun. And interesting. Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast.
F	MARY	Let's hope all that does it for him. As Mary reaches the bottom step --
M	STEVE	Mary, hi. I'm Steve. She puts up a finger - "just a second". She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	And how's your mother?
M	STEVE	Great. Thanks. She just stares at him and smiles.
F	MARY	Gods. You may have noticed that I'm wearing clean socks. Translation: I'm really trying and thus should be amply rewarded. Thanks for your support. She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees.
F	MARY	And by support I don't mean, you know - She hikes up her bra.
F	MARY	I mean your assistance, your furtherance, your advocacy of my efforts to get out there and... do what I'm supposed to do. She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	There we go. Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red
M	STEVE	Ready? Mary nods a bunch of times.
M	STEVE	Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight. Sir.
M	MR. HOROWITZ (O.S.)	You kids have fun.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Be careful now. Don't forget your seatbelts. Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the
F	MR. HOROWITZ	She'll be fine. They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.
M	STEVE	Sorry about this blind date thing. My mother -
F	MARY	I never went to kindergarten! He looks at her, totally confused.
F	MARY	They skipped me to the forth grade.
M	STEVE	Okay. She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates
F	MARY	I missed finger painting. He has no clue what to say.
M	STEVE	Sorry?
F	MARY	Me too. She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back
M	STEVE	Whoa! Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and
M	STEVE	Mary... uh, what about your mother? She straddles him and keeps kissing.
F	MARY	You're not her type. And she's married.
M	STEVE	No, we're right in front of your house and... She undoes her sweater.
M	STEVE	And I have no problem with that whatsoever. She kisses his neck. He looks up with a "thank you, God".
F	MARY	Steve?
M	STEVE	Mary.
F	MARY	Is it Steven with a V or Stephen with a P-H? She works over his face over like it's an ice cream cone.
F	MARY	I thought so. There are almost a million Stevens with a V in the country, you know. It's much more popular than the P-H way, almost twice as popular in fact. I think it's the Brits who prefer the P-H. They love their P-H's over there. Not as much as they love their fish and chips but still, they love them. It was the media thing, you know, that's why our moms wanted us to get together. You work in the media, so do I. We really have to hand it to our moms, Steve, we do, and not just for raising us, or for thriving during a time when women painstakingly struggled for equality, but I mean we should hand it to them for being visionaries and predicting our all encompassing compatibility. We're professionally compatible, yes, but it's occurring to me at this particular moment that we're also sexually compatible, and I don't know if you noticed like I noticed but we're also both wearing blue. What are the chances of that? Actually, if I really think about it, the chances are probably pretty good. Blue is one of the most popular three colors, however, yours is- She leans forward and checks the fabric tag on the neck of
F	MARY	Nylon. And mine... She grabs her own tag and reads it, just about elbowing Steve
F	MARY	Polyester! See? Both synthetic fibres! And the chances of that are much smaller than the chances of us just wearing blue. Steve looks at Mary - suddenly fully aware of her craziness.
F	MARY	Do you like crosswords?
M	STEVE	Sure. She just about jumps out of her pants with excitement.
F	MARY	Me too! And semantics, the study of the meaning of words? You love words, right?
M	STEVE	What's not to love.
F	MARY	I know! She can hardly believe her good fortune. Her mind reels just
F	MARY	Steve with a V, you know what we are? We're didymous. Two of a kind. Two rare earth elements brought together by Norns, that's Scandinavian for The Destinies. You want to make out for ten to fifteen minutes more then go get a six pack of Twinkies and Mountain Dew and stay up all night and talk? Steve is frozen. No escape - then it hits him. He jumps a
M	STEVE	Sorry. I have to get this.
F	MARY	I didn't hear it ring.
M	STEVE	Vibrate.
F	MARY	I didn't feel it
M	STEVE	You didn't? This is Steve... What? Really? Now? If I don't have a choice... He hangs up, looks at Mary like he feels bad.
M	STEVE	Work. I have to go to... Boston. This happens all the time. You know how it is. Wherever news happens... Mary gets off of him, slides back into her seat, buttons her
F	MARY	It's okay. When you get back we can have plenty of quality time.
M	STEVE	Sure. I'll call you. He leans over, opens her door.
F	MARY	remember.
M	STEVE	No kidding. You certainly are - He searches for any word that will do. Mary jumps in.
F	MARY	Normal.
M	STEVE	You read my mind. Never happier, she jumps out of the car. As he drives away, she pulls the paper bag out of her pocket,
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Sweetie, what's wrong? What happened? My God, you've barely been gone ten minutes. Mary stops on the stairs, turns back.
F	MARY	Mom, sometimes that's all you need to know he's the one! Mary smiles big, takes the rest of the stairs up two at a
F	MR. HOROWITZ	That girl makes up her mind the moon is green, it's green. Leave her be. It'll pass. Eventually. Mrs. Horowitz moves away from the stairs, no less worried.
F	MARY	Eleven letter word for serendipity. She screams into her pillow.
F	MARY	The perfect answer: S-E-R-E-N-D-I-P- I-T-Y. Serendipity. Why would you ever need a better word than that? She sits up, grabs her notebook, starts to draw out a new In the Editor's office, JIM SOLOMAN looks over the newspaper
M	SOLOMAN	Let's split the gardening feature into two weeks. Keep them in suspense. He steps back, looks at the whole layout.
M	SOLOMAN	Looks good. How are we doing here? He checks his watch.
M	SOLOMAN	Five minutes to spare. Look at that. The Assistant points to a blank corner of page 26. Soloman's
M	SOLOMAN	Horowitz.
M	MARY (V.0.)	When I was a fledgling (that means novice) crossword constructor, I would find comfort in the words of the learned crossword sages. Above all, my hero is Manny Nosowsky, frequent New York Times contributor and all around cruciverbial master.
M	MARY (V.O.)	Manny says that a crossword puzzle's greatness can be determined by asking three simple questions. She marches in the direction of the Editor's office.
M	MARY (V.0.)	Is it solvable? She almost collides with a mail cart but keeps walking.
M	MARY (V.0.)	Is it entertaining? She arrives at the Editor's office, plants her feet in the Does it s arkle? She looks down at the crossword puzzle in her hands, smiles, Soloman grabs the crossword and hands it right to the The other Old Lady holds up her blank crossword, shrugs.
M	TAXI DRIVER	This is bullshit. A long haired GUY gets up from his seat, puts his coat on.
M	GUY	Don't even bother, man. I don't know what the deal is, but it looks like all the answers are --
M	SOLOMAN	Steve? Mary sits and smiles.
M	SOLOMAN	Every single answer is "Steve"? Who the hell is Steve anyway? No wait, I don't care, but I do care that you pissed off our readers. Mary's smile falls a bit.
M	SOLOMAN	I thought you knew better than to pull something like this. It's unprofessional, it's -- to him. He's too frustrated, the words aren't coming
F	MARY	Romantic?
M	SOLOMAN	No!
F	MARY	Creativo? That's Italian for "creative".
M	SOLOMAN	No.
F	MARY	How about -
M	SOLOMAN	Mary. We're letting you go.
F	MARY	Oh.
M	up her Kroger	She looks like she's going to cry. She picks bag, fidgets.
F	MARY	Maybe I could make it up to you by doing a fishing themed crossword. I know how you love the piscatology. Soloman shakes his head -- it's done. Mary hesitates then finally gets up.
F	MARY	Okay. I'll just give you some time then. We'll talk next week. He ignores that. She walks out, seemingly content, a bit of A PAYROLL CLERK sees the elevator doors close behind Mary.
M	PAYROLL CLERK	She forgot her severance.

M	THE	waiting for her. She sits down beside him. He holds up
F	MR. HOROWITZ	Interesting way to go.
F	MARY	Indeed.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	They like it? She points to the other newspaper in his lap.
F	MARY	Finished with the Times? She goes to take the paper. He stops her.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	Neshama, the puzzle. How'd it go? She looks around. Nowhere to run.
F	MARY	How do you think? She looks at him -- worry all over his face. She hesitates
F	MARY	Because if you're thinking that they loved it, that they thought it was imaginative and bold and evocative... you would be right. He's not sure how to take that.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	And Steve?
F	MARY	He works a lot, you know. Travels all the time. 'Tis possible he has not yet espied it. She picks up the crossword, admires it.
F	MARY	But when he does, I'm sure he'll say, "that Mary Horowitz... is a catch. Where oh where has she been all my empty life? From here onward my life will be divided into 'before I met Mary' and 'after I met Mary' with the second part being far superior. I am lonely no more. The missing letter in my puzzle has at last been found."
F	MR. HOROWITZ	I don't want you getting your hopes up too much.
F	MARY	I'm not.
M	ANGUS	We're going to hit rush. We'll have to take the second flight. Exec. Producer DAN CORBITT walks in, heads straight for his
M	CORBITT	You're set. KDFW's on site now. Angus and Steve start to get up.
M	CORBITT	Hang on. They sit. Corbitt grabs the remote control, turns the TV on.
M	CORBITT	Anybody want to tell me about this? He fast forwards through footage of Hartman reporting from a The camera gets closer and closer - each time it pulls away
M	ANGUS	Take a look at those... plants. Corbitt pauses it on the worst shot, looks at Steve.
M	CORBITT	We can't use this. Hartman fakes disgust.
M	HARTMAN	Of course not. Nice camera work, Stevie. Steve glares at Hartman. Corbitt points at the frozen shot
M	CORBITT	You want to go back to the Weather Channel, try that again. Corbitt checks his watch, points them out the door.
M	CORBITT	Get out of here. Don't embarrass me in Dallas. Hartman, Angus and Steve walk out. Steve nods to Hartman - In the hallway, Steve's cell phone rings. He answers it.
M	STEVE	What?... Mom, let me call you back. He listens, signals to Angus he needs a minute, then stops at
M	STEVE	What page? He finds Mary's crossword. He looks at it closely, totally
M	STEVE	Jesus.
F	MARY	Four letter word for am I going to wait my whole life for Steve to call? She suddenly stops writing.
F	MARY	Nope. She flails out of the tub like a salmon heading upstream,
F	MARY	Ow ow ouch. She gets off the banister, slops the rest of the way down the
F	MARY	The news is Steve's life! It's not just what he does, it's who he is, imbedded deep down in his polymer of nucleotides. I should be out there by his side. That's what girlfriends do, isn't it? Let him concentrate on his work. I'll concentrate on the relationship. It won't be easy, I know, but neither is quantum physics or... the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle or... paper mache, but I've managed to do fine with those, haven't I? She looks at her parents. They sit at a table playing bridge
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Mary, you remember the Hancocks.
F	MARY	Top of the evening. Mr. Hancock checks out Mary's bare legs as she stands in a
M	MRS. HANCOCK	Loved this week's puzzle, dear. Whoever Steve is, he must be a very lucky young man. Mr. Horowitz gives Mrs. Hancock a look - "don't encourage
F	MARY	Exactly! And all I have to do is go to him, be near him, and do my best to radiate... me. Mr. Horowitz doesn't like the sound of this.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	And where exactly will this radiation take place? Mary rushes to the TV, turns it on, flips it to CNN. A shot of the Medieval Times castle in Dallas, TX. The
F	MARY	Wherever news happens, Dad. Wherever news happens.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	This is nuts. Mary takes the bags from him.
F	MARY	Abe, Catherine, I'm off. I don't know where I'm going - The Greyhound Bus DRIVER hollers from behind her.
M	DRIVER	Dallas.
F	MARY	Geographically yes, I know. Figuratively, philosophically, spiritually, much less so. My entire life is before me. The world is my ostrea edulis... That means the edible kind of oyster.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	That's beautiful, sweetie. You sure you won't take mine instead? She tries to switch her leather bag for Mary's Kroger bag.
F	MARY	Mom, two handles, two handles, they both hold stuff, what's the difference? Mrs. Horowitz goes to explain, gives up.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	That Steve shows any disrespect, you're on the next bus back here.
F	MARY	Disrespect. Do you mean unmannerly, tactless, vulgar? Because he's a straight man, Dad, and some things can't be helped. But if you mean inconsiderate to me, contemptuous toward me, insulting, irreverent, uncivil -
M	DRIVER	Let's go already! She steps up one more step, yells out to her parents and the
F	MARY	I don't know when I'll be back but I do know this- The door shuts in her face.
F	MARY	I'm not coming back alone.
M	HARTMAN	Paula, what started out as a routine rehearsal here at the Dallas Medieval Times turned deadly when an employee allegedly turned on his fellow performers. Twenty- four hours later, at least thirty employees are still being held hostage by the assailant, their lives hanging in the balance. He listens to his earpiece, nods.
M	HARTMAN	The castle you see behind me is one of eight medieval Times dinner theatre restaurants. Guests who cross the drawbridge enjoy a medieval style feast while watching the main attraction: knights engaging in a battle of strength and skill. The restaurant promises "fun, feasting and fighting" but it appears that this time, fun was in short supply. A few feet away, Angus frantically takes notes as he talks to
M	HARTMAN	Paula, devastating news just in. We have one confirmed death - an Andalusian - a purebred Spanish horse. One of many that perform in the show, and the first innocent victim of a rogue knight's rage... He takes a moment to fake compose himself, barely getting the
M	HARTMAN	At times like this, I like to think there's a heaven just for horses. A rolling meadow, lush grasses, unlimited supply of... those things horses like to lick - or is that cows? Nevertheless, a beautiful, peaceful place. He turns and looks toward to the Medieval Times.
M	HARTMAN	May you long roam in that heaven, noble horse - Angus hands him another note. Hartman scans it, instantly
M	HARTMAN	But not quite yet. We're the first to report, the horse is not dead, Paula. Not dead. The horse is alive and well after having merely fainted, as it was trained to do for the show. One happy, blessed miracle... while a deranged madman continues to hold the lives of his coworkers in his depraved hands. And they're out. A pissed off Hartman pulls out his
M	HARTMAN	Dammit, Angus. Get it a bit closer to right before you hand it to me. Josh moves in, removes Hartman's mic.
M	STEVE	But then we wouldn't have heard about horse heaven. Josh and Angus laugh.
M	HARTMAN	It's that kind of genius that won me the Southeast Idaho Christian Family Coalition's Journalist of the Year award, you ingrates.
F	MARY	Omaha... Einstein... cholera... grenade... Bach... oui... potbelly... Oreo. The man drops the crossword, glares at her.
F	MARY	Sorry. She looks away, starts biting her nails, then spots a sign on
F	MARY	Bessemer, Alabama! Named after Sir Henry Bessemer, a Brit. Guess what he did? Perfected the way steel is made, of course. I won't bore you with the whole story, just the best parts, like how it involves molten pig iron which does not, as one might think, have anything to do with pigs. It's actually a raw iron made from iron ore, plus limestone, plus coke - and by coke I mean the carbonaceous residue, not the cola, or the booger sugar. Mary looks around for a response -- nothing.
F	MARY	You know what else is in Bessemer? The city, I mean? Hitler's typewriter. It's crazy, I know. That guy was such an asshole. The Driver's eyes glaze over. Please let this and.
M	DRIVER	We'll just take five minutes here. He steps off the bus. Mary turns to the man next to her.
F	MARY	Can you watch my stuff? He glares at her -- you have got to be kidding. Mary grabs On the TV: "MEDIEVAL TIMES HOSTAGE CRISIS".
M	HARTMAN	Perhaps the greatest obstacle the hostage negotiators face is the suspect's refusal to communicate using modern day technology. In keeping with his role as a medieval knight, he's insisting on an eleventh century messenger to deliver all communication. The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR.
M	ANCHOR	What are we talking about here, Hartman? Carrier pigeons?
F	MARY	Homing pigeons. A few of the Diners overhear.
M	HARTMAN	Actually, homing pigeons. The Diners look at Mary.
F	MARY	Carrier pigeons, despite their name, are more or less useless when it comes to actually carrying anything. Homing pigeons are better for messenger work... The Diners lose interest. Mary catches the eye of a WANDERER
F	MARY	You know who used them all the time? Genghis Khan. Loved the pigeons, scared to death of pooches though. The Wanderer just stares at her.
F	MARY	You know, dogs, canines, de honden? Still nothing. She looks back at the TV.
M	ANCHOR	Have the negotiators located any homing pigeons? Where do you even get them in this day and age?
M	HARTMAN	You can buy them on the internet for twenty-five bucks a pop. Mary looks at the Diners, smiles, points to the TV.
F	MARY	My boyfriend is probably holding that camera right now. The Diners ignore her and just eat their pie. Mary realizes
F	MARY	Crap! Crap, crap, crap! She looks down the road -- no sign of the bus anywhere. She
F	MARY	Dallas goes through here?
M	TRUCK DRIVER	Can't say I do.
F	MARY	I missed mine. She breathes double time into the paper bag. He takes pity
M	TRUCK DRIVER	I'm headed that way. He points to his truck. Mary looks at the truck, looks at With no sign of an answer forthcoming, the Truck Driver keeps
F	MARY	You ever killed animals? He looks at her, surprised but amused.
M	TRUCK DRIVER	Road kill?
F	MARY	Set a garbage can full of kittens on fire or anything like that? Now he's disturbed.
M	TRUCK DRIVER	No.
F	MARY	Humans?
M	TRUCK DRIVER	Would I tell you if I did?
F	MARY	Touche, sir. Touche. Mary thinks some more.
M	TRUCK DRIVER	Wait for the next bus if that suits you. He climbs into the truck. Mary runs to catch up with him.
F	MARY	Do you have a .light? Matches, Zippo, blow torch, et al?
M	TRUCK DRIVER	Afraid not.
F	MARY	May I see your license? Why not. He pulls his license out of the visor, flashes it.
F	MARY	Norman James Durwood. She reaches up and shakes his hand.
F	MARY	Mary Magdalene Horowitz.
M	TRUCK DRIVER/NORM	Good to meet you... I think. Still holding the license, she digs in her Kroger bag, pulls
F	MARY	Norm, if you're going to rape and murder me, you'll have to cut me up into a million chunks and scatter me all over four states, otherwise this appendage - She holds her arm up, shows him.
F	MARY	Will lead homicide detectives right to you. She smiles at him warmly, puts the marker back in her bag.
F	MARY	And you already told me you don't have a light to burn the flesh off. Norm can't believe this. Before he can say a word, Mary
F	MARY	Moon Pies! Want to go halfsies? At a loss, Norm motions for Mary to help herself. As she
M	ANGUS	Rebecca wants you to come for dinner when we're back home. Her cousin from Florida -
M	STEVE	Forget it.
M	ANGUS	What?
M	STEVE	It's a set up.
M	ANGUS	She's hot.
M	STEVE	I don't care. Never again. My mom set me up with this chick -
M	ANGUS	You let you mother set you up? What the hell is wrong with you? There's a commotion in the distance. Every photographer on Hartman touches up his make-up, roots through his bag. He Which one of you bastards hid my bronzing shimmer? The police surrounding the castle take aim.
F	MARY	And my other rule about crossword puzzles is this. No pencils. Doing a crossword with a pencil is like screaming with your lips duct taped together. It's weak. If you're going to do a crossword, you should do it fearlessly, with abandon, and with a pen. I prefer a medium tip, felt, blue -
M	NORM	Quiet time might be good right about now.
F	MARY	Oh. She thinks about it, whispers.
F	MARY	Do you mean quiet as in softly hushed like this? Or do you mean quiet, as in silent? He nods. Mary squeezes her lips together, holds them. It
F	MARY	Norm?
M	NORM	What?
F	MARY	Thanks for not raping me.
M	NORM	My pleasure.
F	MARY	Eight letter word for "screwed". Mary crosses to the Medieval Times parking lot, steps over
F	MARY	F-A-S-T-E-N-E-D. Fastened. She looks around. There's nobody for miles.
M	MARY (V.O.)	That's what's great about crosswords, and life. Every once in a while, you get a surprise. She heads back to the interstate, starts walking.
F	MARY	All roads lead to Oklahoma, Papa.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	Last time I checked, freeway 20 still heads right back here.
F	MARY	My road, dad. My road. You don't commit to a relationship and then give up because you'd rather be at home curled up in front of the fireplace with a thesaurus. This is what people are supposed to do - go out on a limb for love. My limb just happens to be in Oklahoma. It's only 850 miles away from home. No big deal. Just think of this like the time I went to Girl Scout camp, except for the part where I got kicked out. This time, no unsupervised butane experiment is going to ruin the adventure, I swear.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	Oklahoma. Images of the Oklahoma hospital vigil are everywhere. A long line of news crews, views of the hospital's admitting
M	KOCO REPORTER	Eleven months ago, the child we've come to know as Baby Peggy was born with an extremely rare birth defect, a third leg. Shortly after the birth, her parents Misty and Bill Dunlevy separated. Now with joint custody, one parent wants the baby to keep the third leg, the other wants it gone... A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS REPORTER is on camera.
M	FOX NEWS REPORTER	After months of legal wrangling, a judge has ordered in favor of the mother. Amputation surgery is scheduled for Wednesday but the father, Bill Dunlevy, isn't about to give up. As his lawyers work to secure an injunction, the devoted father rallies public support for the extra limb. At the end of the long line of news crews, Steve has the "God wouldn't have given my child the third leg if he didn't want her to keep it." But for now, the fate of that precious child's third leg is the hands of a judge... This is Hartman Hughes reporting, live from Oklahoma City. Steve signals they've cut, lowers his camera. Hartman calls
M	HARTMAN	What if next time I say Baby Peggy is like the wishbone of her parents' dispute? Hartman acts out a wishbone pull. Steve's disgusted.
M	STEVE	Yeah, go ahead and suggest that. Corbitt will love it. Steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off
M	STEVE	Mind if I ask you a few questions on camera?
M	HOWARD	Me?
M	STEVE	How do you feel about what's going on here? Steve shoulders his camera, focuses in on Howard's sign.
M	HOWARD	I haven't made up my mind yet. Both parties have valid arguments. A taxi inches through the crowd. It barely stops when Mary Steve's attention is drawn away from the interview with
M	STEVE	Please God, no. He looks for a place to hide but she's running ridiculously
F	MARY	Steve! She jumps into his arms but he's only got one arm free and
F	MARY	I'm here! Surprised?
M	STEVE	Surprised?
F	MARY	Astounded, flabbergasted, bushwacked - He pulls Mary off to the side, away from everybody.
M	STEVE	What are you doing?
F	MARY	Talking to you. And noticing how the Oklahoma climate agrees with your complexion.
M	STEVE	Tell me you didn't come all the way here just to see me.
F	MARY	Of course not... I went to Dallas looking for you first. And you know why? Steve grabs his head. This is not happening.
F	MARY	Because you're inimitable and I'm intransigent.
M	STEVE	No, we're not. I don't know what that means but trust me. We're so not.
F	MARY	It means you're awesome and I'm unstoppable.
M	STEVE	Great. Listen, Mary, you seem like a nice girl, and the ten minutes we spent together were --
F	MARY	Mind blowing. At a complete loss, he just goes along.
M	STEVE	Sure, but I'm working here. Working. Mary points to the partially hidden side door of the
F	MARY	I know. I'm just here to support you, show you I care, and also ask why you aren't following that guy pretending to be a nurse but obviously not wearing sterilizable, non-slip footwear. Steve looks toward the hospital, spots the Man.
F	MARY	If I was Baby Peggy's dad, that's how I'd avoid the press too. Steve takes off running. Mary yells out to him.
F	MARY	I'll be right here in case you want to make out later on! Steve looks back, a bunch of people stare. Mary waves to him A SECURITY GUARD approaches her.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Miss, if you want to be here, you're going to have to stay behind the fence. Mary turns to see what he's pointing at - the growing crowd
M	PROTESTORS	Near, far, wherever you are, we believe that the leg should stay on... Mary watches, paralyzed with awe, like seeing herself in the At last, she has found her people. Elizabeth looks up at Mary, smiles.
F	ELIZABETH	I like your boots.
F	MARY	Thanks. I found them in an alley. Elizabeth looks at the boots again, impressed. She stands
F	ELIZABETH	Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?
F	MARY	Neither really.
F	ELIZABETH	This is the pro-leg group over here. We're supporting Baby Peggy's dad in his fight to save the baby's third leg. She points to the end of the fenced off area where only a few
F	ELIZABETH	Those are the anti-leggers. They're all for the amputation.
F	MARY	I'm just here because my boyfriend is working the story. He's with CNN, the world's news leader, the most trusted name in news, the place where more -
F	ELIZABETH	The pro-leggers have better snacks.
F	MARY	I'm definitely pro-leg. Elizabeth smiles, hands Mary a candle. Mrs. Horowitz spots Mary in the crowd, standing next to
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	There she is! Abe, look! There she is right there. Mr. Horowitz glances up from his book.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	She's going to set her hair on fire with that candle.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Look, she's made friends. Mrs. Horowitz tries not to cry.
M	STEVE	She's on me what, thirty seconds after meeting me, and the chick will not shut up the whole time. I had to fake a work call, gave her the -
M	ANGUS	Wherever news goes...
M	STEVE	I think I'm in the clear, then she does this crossword - she works for the Citizen - she does this crossword all about me, and as if that's not crazy enough, she shows up here.
M	ANGUS	Here?
M	STEVE	Over by the fence. Red boots. Can't miss her.
M	ANGUS	Is she hot?
M	STEVE	Jesus, Angus. When a psychotic chick's swinging a machete at your throat, who cares if she's hot?
M	ANGUS	I've been married to the same woman for seventeen years. I care.
M	STEVE	Crazy, man. The chick is cra-zy. Hartman sits up, totally awake and never happier. He points
M	HARTMAN	Priceless! This is priceless! Steve cringes.
M	STEVE	Hughes, don't. Don't even.
M	PROTESTOR WIFE	All we're saying is, wait until Baby Peggy can talk and ask her what she wants to do with the spare. Mary listens in while she dispenses a hot chocolate from
F	MARY	Thanks, Bruno. He walks away. Mary takes a sip of the hot chocolate, burns
F	MARY	Crap. She grabs her tongue with her fingers. Hartman appears right
M	HARTMAN	M'lady. She's a bit stunned and star struck. He offers his hand.
M	HARTMAN	Hartman Hughes. Mary lets go of her tongue, uses her saliva covered hand to
F	MARY	Mary.
M	HARTMAN	Mary'. Mary, Mary, Mary. He takes his hand back, discretely wipes it on his pants.
M	HARTMAN	Steve told me you were beautiful. He was going on and on and on and on about it. I had to come see for myself. Great boots.
F	MARY	Thank y- He puts an arm around her, pulls her away from the crowd.
M	HARTMAN	Listen, Mary, I've been working with Steve for about a year now. The guy is like a brother to me. A YOUNG PROTESTOR recognizes Hartman.
M	YOUNG PROTESTOR	Hartman Hughes'. Without missing a step, Hartman grabs a pen from his pocket
M	HARTMAN	Girls follow us around everywhere we go. Who do you think they're after? Hartman reflects on it, smiles.
M	HARTMAN	Me, of course me, but every once in a while some of them try to land Steve. It's true. Sure he'll go for a few skanks here and there but it's all just a sad attempt to hide his fear. All he wants is to love but he's afraid of opening up, afraid of putting himself out there, afraid of somebody like you, Mary - yes you - afraid of you breaking his heart. Can you blame him? She's a bit stunned and confused by all of this.
F	MARY	No?
M	HARTMAN	No! Promise me this. Promise you'll stick around long enough to help him get over that fear. He tells you to go away, don't. He says he thinks you're crazy? You're not. He's crazy, Mary. Crazy not to let down his walls and tell you how he really feels. Can I count on you to hang in there no matter what?
F	MARY	Of course. I don't want to interfere in his work but I just need to be here for him and - He grabs her, hugs her in so her words are all muffled - and
M	HARTMAN	Good girl. The SECURITY GUARD walks past, gestures that they should be
M	HARTMAN	I'll tell Steve to come find you when we wrap for the day. What side are you on?
F	MARY	Pro-leg. She shows him her button featuring a cartoon of a very happy
M	HARTMAN	You might want to jump camps. No way they're going let that baby keep the third leg and live like a freak. Trust me. He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp.
F	MARY	She'd just be like the tree frogs. Hartman turns around. What?
F	MARY	A trematode parasite causes polymely (that means extra limbs) in tree frogs. It happens all the time. In some ponds there's like a quarter of the tree frogs with extra legs. Totally natural. Hartman looks at her like she's a nutcase.
M	HARTMAN	What's going on? Josh rushes to get the mic on Hartman.
M	JOSH	The parents of the kid got back together. Surgery's cancelled.
M	HARTMAN	No amputation?
M	STEVE	Tell me you weren't talking to Mary.
M	HARTMAN	Who?
M	STEVE	Go to hell, Hughes. scans it Angus hands Hartman the press release. Hartman quickly.
M	HARTMAN	It's over? The kid keeps the leg.
M	ANGUS	For now. Hartman checks his teeth in a hand mirror.
M	HARTMAN	'Til she gets it caught in a car door. The disappointed anti-leg protestors ditch their signs and
M	KOCO REPORTER	With mere hours to spare, the Dunlevys reconciled, agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy is old enough to decide for herself. Further down the row of reporters:
M	FOX NEWS REPORTER	And while dozens of children fight for their lives behind these walls, Baby Peggy won't be one of them. With surgery cancelled, it's time for the Dunlevys to be a family once again. Past a few more news crews, at the end the line, Steve has
M	HARTMAN	And like the noble tree frog whose extra leg is nothing if not natural, so Baby Peggy begins the rest of her three legged life... This is Hartman Hughes reporting live from Oklahoma City. Hartman pulls out his ear piece. Angus, Josh and Steve all
M	STEVE	Tree frog? Where do you get this shit? Hartman taps the side of his head -- it's all up here.
M	HARTMAN	A little thing called astutitude, my friends. Steve and Angus look at each other -- is that even a word?
F	MARY	There you go, George. Just a little nasolacrimal duct cleaning. Nothing to be ashamed of. Elizabeth runs up to Mary, hugs her.
F	ELIZABETH	You see? When you sing loud enough and when your signs are big enough, people listen! Mary spots some of the news vans pulling away.
F	MARY	Steve!
F	ELIZABETH	Go, go on. I'll watch your stuff. Mary drops her bags, runs toward the media camp. Angus starts driving slowly across the grass behind other
F	MARY	Steve! STEVE!
M	HARTMAN	Angus, hold up. Steve sees what Hartman's looking at.
M	STEVE	No, go. Fast. Hartman rolls down his window.
M	STEVE	Don't. Hartman sticks his head out the window.
M	STEVE	Hughes, I swear I'll kill you. Hartman waves to Mary to catch up. Angus sees her in the
M	ANGUS	Is that her? She's hot.
M	STEVE	Angus, come on man, get me out of here.
M	ANGUS	She's really hot.
M	STEVE	Who cares? Jesus, you guys - Angus hits the brakes. Steve hides behind the seat just as
M	HARTMAN	Hi beautiful. Mary tries to get a look at Steve but can only see part of
F	MARY	Steve? Are you okay? Is he okay? Angus leans over to her window.
M	ANGUS	I don't think we've met. Angus. Mary shakes Angus' hand. He can't take his eyes off her.
M	HARTMAN	Steve's not feeling well.
F	MARY	Oh no.
M	HARTMAN	I'm sure he'll be fine by the time we get to New Mexico.
M	ANGUS	Your eyes are striking. Steve punches him through the seat. Mary's oblivious.
F	MARY	Thank you.
M	HARTMAN	Steve really wants you to follow us. It would mean a lot to him.
M	STAYS	Steve cringes, goes to speak up but stops himself and
M	HARTMAN	He was going to go ask you himself but look at the poor bastard. So sick he can't even sit up straight.
F	MARY	What if it's a viral zoonotic disease? He should see a doctor.
M	HARTMAN	Exactly what I told him, but the only person he wants touching his infected flesh is you. Mary looks at Steve, worried.
F	MARY	But wait, what if - up. Hartman grabs her face, squishes her lips to shut her
M	HARTMAN	Hey now, we need you to be strong for him. Leachinan trial, Santa Fe, can you remember that? Mary nods, unable to speak.
M	HARTMAN	We'll meet you there, God willing. He lets go of her face.
F	MARY	Will you take care of him?
M	HARTMAN	Like he's my own. She backs away from the window. Angus waves to her and
M	ANGUS	Nothing wrong with that one.
M	JOSH	Except for those boots.
M	STEVE	You're an asshole, Hughes. Hartman laughs.
F	MARY	Elizabeth! I have to meet Steve at his next job, in New Mexico. He's sick, not as in rad, although he is that too, but more like unwell, infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully nothing serious but you never can be too sure and besides, healthy or not, he needs me.
F	ELIZABETH	Sign my book before you go? Elizabeth hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen.
F	MARY	The trip's not too long, right through all kinds of interesting sites like, for example, El Santuario de Chimayo: The Lourdes of America. Know what that is? A sacred sand pit near a burrito stand. What could be better than that? Mary looks away from Elizabeth, fidgets a bit.
F	MARY	Want to go? Unless you're busy, I mean. You probably have something better to do. Elizabeth thinks about it.
F	ELIZABETH	Not really. Mary is stunned. She takes a minute to realize it's real,
M	HOWARD (O.S.)	I'll go too. Mary turns around and spots Howard.
F	ELIZABETH	Mary, have you met Howard? Mary shakes her head. Howard offers his hand. It's got
F	ELIZABETH	Mary, Howard. Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard's got a car, you know. He can drive us. Mary looks at him, thinks about it.
F	MARY	What kind of car do you have?
M	HOWARD	Plymouth Colt.
F	MARY	What year?
M	HOWARD	Eighty-nine. Mary quickly scans her memory.
F	MARY	Replace the recalled seat belts?
M	HOWARD	Yes. Mary thinks about it, smiles.
F	MARY	Let's grab souvenirs! Elizabeth and Howard each pick up a Baby Peggy sign off the
M	MARY (V.0.)	Here's something you never see in crosswords, two letter words, and thank goodness for that. The word "go": not fun. The word "vamoose": super fun. You see? crosswords are just like life in that way - they're only boring if you have no sense of adventure.
M	HOWARD	You can have that. I have more.
F	MARY	Thanks. Mary puts the apple in her Kroger bag.
F	MARY	Howard, if you get sleepy and want to trade off driving for a while, just wake me up and I'll take over. I'm a night owl, yes, but I'm also a day owl too, a burrowing owl, technically. They stay awake all day too. I'm pretty much alert 24/7, always have been. No caffeine. Just sugar and my natural tendency to, you know, never fall asleep. Mary leans back, closes her eyes, and she's out.
F	MARY	Persimmon. AKA, the mabolo, the date-plum, the velvet apple. Genus: Diospyros. A REPORTER for Inside Edition talks on camera.
M	INSIDE EDITION REPORTER	This tragedy began eight months ago in what was once paradise - the Elysium Sanctuary outside of Taos, New Mexico. For years, celebrities considered the five star meditation resort the only true place for spiritual purification, and with good reason. Nestled in the heart of reclaimed Pueblo Indian lands, the Elysium Sanctuary promised one thing - enlightenment. A COURT TV REPORTER is on camera a few feet away.
M	COURT TV REPORTER	But the Elysium Sanctuary would never be the same after tragedy struck last winter. Twenty-six year old resort masseuse Juan Carlos Velasquez found stabbed to death in the meditation villa of beloved star of stage and screen, Cloris Leachman. A bit further down the'line of reporters, an EXTRA! REPORTER
M	EXTRA! REPORTER	Publicists for the eighty year old Leachman insist her relationship with the deceased Velasquez was no different than with the dozens of other resort personnel attending to Ms. Leachman during her solitude retreat. At the end of the row, Hartman reports.
M	HARTMAN	But the octogenarian Leachman may not have been as innocent as her representatives claimed, at least according to the evidence found at the murder scene. Hartman reads from his notes.
M	HARTMAN	Whips, hot wax, bamboo skewers, a spanking bench, and perhaps most damaging, a henna tattoo across Ms. Leachman's chest that read "Mrs. Juan Carlos Velasquez". On one side, an odd assortment of fans with signs like "FREE On the other side of the crowd, a smaller group of MEXICAN
M	HOWARD	Guilty or not? They all think about it. A greasy haired Shaman CLYDE steps
M	CLYDE	Everybody deserves the benefit of the doubt. He looks at Mary, smiles.
M	CLYDE	Everybody. As he joins the Leachman fans, Mary thinks about it.
F	MARY	Be has a point.
F	ELIZABETH	Yay! I love Cloris Leachman.
M	HOWARD	Who doesn't?
M	MEXICAN MOURNERS	jMuerte! iMuerte! iMuerte!
F	MARY	I have to go find Steve. How do I look? Unwashed hair, bed head, and there's a chunk of a Twinkie
F	ELIZABETH	Perfect.
F	MARY	I'll be back. Save me a sign! And if Cloris comes out, tell her I loved her in "My Little Pony: The Movie". Mary runs off as Howard and Elizabeth join the crowd of fans.
M	HARTMAN	Hi gorgeous. What'd you do to your hair?
F	MARY	Slept on it in the car. Where's Steve? Is he okay?
M	HARTMAN	Never better. Come in and wait. He'll be back soon. Hartman escorts Mary in. The guys perk up a bit.
M	HARTMAN	You all know Mary? Steve's girlfriend? Mary shakes hands around the table, greets them all in their
F	MARY	Hello... Bonjour... Hola... She gets to Angus. He kisses her hand.
M	ANGUS	My dear, sit. He shoves the BBC guy out of the way to make room for Mary
M	VINCE	Mary, you in?
F	MARY	Poker? Technically I'm familiar but I've never actually played. With people, I mean.
M	SPANISH JOURNALIST	She's in. Doug throws in some cash as Vince starts to deal. The crowd continues to grow. A Candles are lit, healing
F	MARY	"There are few things that are so unpardonably neglected in our country as poker." Guess who said that one. She looks around the table. The guys, except Angus, are
F	MARY	Mark Twain. And you know what else-
M	BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER	Darling, you in or not?
F	MARY	Sorry. Mary looks at her cards, thinks about it for way too long,
F	MARY	Send it, ladies! Steve steps into the tent, spots Mary, turns to run back out.
M	HARTMAN	Don't go, Steve! Look who's here. Mary jumps up - just about knocks the table over, then
F	MARY	Thank God you're okay! He looks over her shoulder and mouths "you're dead" to
M	TO	He holds her back at arm's length, looks at her, goes
M	STEVE	You have to stop stalking me.
F	MARY	I'm not. It's more like picking travel destinations based on where you happen to be working.
M	STEVE	Stalking.
F	MARY	Hartman told me you wanted me here. Now that I am, what better opportunity for us to get to know each other better.
M	STEVE	This is crazy.
F	MARY	Hartman said you'd say that.
M	STEVE	Go home, Mary.
F	MARY	And he said you'd say that too. It's just your fear talking. Steve just about loses it.
M	STEVE	He's not my friend, he's not your friend. He's just an asshole who thinks it's fun to string you along and make my life hell. He yells toward the tent.
M	STEVE	Hughes! Get out here! Mary looks right at him.
F	MARY	You know how sometimes you see a guy with an attractive girl and you think how the heck did he pull that off? People won't think that when they look at us. We're perfectly matched. She can hardly contain her excitement. Hartman peeks out of the tent.
M	HARTMAN	For the hundredth time, Steve, no, I am not interested in a threesome with you and your new girlfriend. Steve points to Mary.
M	STEVE	Tell her the truth. About all the crap you told her.
M	HARTMAN	Okay. Fine. Hartman goes to Mary, grabs her hand.
M	HARTMAN	Everything I said about Steve, about his feelings for you, his hopes, his dreams, his fears, his unexplainable odor, forget about it. Forget everything I said. None of it was true. Mary's stunned, devastated. She looks like she's going to
M	HARTMAN	Because nothing I said comes close to the enormity of Steve's real feelings for you! Mary perks up. Steve yanks his hand off her shoulder like
M	HARTMAN	It's a love that defies words! Steve jumps him. Hartman fights back. Mary's horrified.
F	MARY	Stop it, you guys! Stop! "Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary." You know who said that? Gandhi. And me. Just now. The fight continues. Mary half covers her eyes.
M	BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER	Fight! They all jump up and run out of the tent.
M	VINCE	Nice one.
M	BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER	Somebody's going to be crying in a minute. Angus hugs Mary to "console" her. Hartman gets Steve in a

M	VINCE	Come on, the guy wears makeup. The guys all start pulling out cash to place bets. Mary
F	MARY	No! This isn't about money! It's about courage, love, honor and all things virtuous and pure. Steve, kick him in the leberknoedel! Hartman looks up at her, hurt. The distraction costs him.
M	JOURNALISTS	Ohhhh! Hartman drops to his knees, tries to pull himself together.
M	STEVE	Tell her!
M	HARTMAN	Okay, alright. Hartman wipes his lip, looks up at Mary.

F	MARY	Please! Somebody help him! Apply a vasoconstrictor, a nasal tampon, anything! At the absolute least, direct pressure and a clean tissue! Steve puts the camera back in place. Hartman recovers fast.
M	HARTMAN	As you can see, Cloris Leachman's fans have become surprisingly violent despite her victory here today. Add this to the list of the most dangerous locations for journalists. Iraq, Somalia, Lebanon, Sri Lanka... and just about any place Cloris Leachman fans gather. Hartman wipes blood from his lip.
M	HARTMAN	Hartman Hughes putting his life at risk to report live from Santa Fe, New Mexico. They cut. Hartman grabs a hand mirror, points to his face,
M	HARTMAN	This is my gift, understand, my instrument. Makes no difference if you're walking around looking like Quasimodo. Ignoring Hartman, Steve walks over to Angus.
M	STEVE	How long do you figure until - Steve's phone rings. He cringes, answers it.
M	CORBITT	Who the hell was that?

F	MARY	But I do! If you're in trouble because of me I can fix it, I can explain to your boss. He or she probably just doesn't understand our relationship.
M	STEVE	We don't have a relationship.
F	MARY	Sure we do, it's just in the pupa stage right now.
M	STEVE	Mary, go home! She looks at him, hurt.
M	STEVE	Go home. He jumps in the CNN truck as Angus starts it up. Mary looks As she watches the truck drive away, her panic suddenly turns
F	MARY	Six letter word for "over my lifeless, rigormortic and maggot infested, i.e. dead, body am I giving up now"... D-O-G-G- motherfucking-E-D. Dogged. She gets out her Chapstick, liberally applies it, dabs a bit
F	MARY	Normally I don't condone swearing. I think it's something people do when they don't have the vocabulary to express themselves properly, but even I, with my plenitudinous vocab, must admit -- every once in a while, it's okay to get a bit peppery -
F	MARY	I got him in trouble, Dad. I have to go find him and make it right. There's three places they could be headed. She pulls a note pad out of her pocket, looks it over.
F	MARY	For each story, I've worked out an equation of potential human casualties, estimated property damage, availability of endlessly repeatable images, with bonus points for anything involving reporters in galoshes. There's no doubt in my mind. They're heading to the storm in Galveston.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	Enough is enough. You've got to get home, turn in your crossword for next week -
M	MARY (O.S.)	I can't think of work at a time like this!
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	You can't chase that boy any more. If he doesn't appreciate you it's ridiculous to -
F	MARY	Ridiculous? Mom! How many times did you propose to dad?
M	MRS. HOROWITZ MR. HOROWITZ	Twice. Seven times.
F	MARY	I rest my case! If you gave up the first time dad said no then I wouldn't exist. Telling me to give up so soon on my potential husband- to-be, birth father of my twelve future children and adoptive father of my gerbil Carol -- you might as well be saying that you wish you had given up too and that you never married dad and that I'd never been born. Is that what you're saying?
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Give Steve my best.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	Be careful.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	And eat! A biscuit, anything. A V8 wouldn't kill you.
F	MARY	Sure you don't want to come along?
F	ELIZABETH	I wish, but I only left enough cat food out for two days. I'll miss you guys! Elizabeth hugs them both, jumps on the bus. Howard and Mary
M	HOWARD	This storm could be bad. Sure you want to drive into it?
F	MARY	How bad could it be? The CNN METEOROLOGIST points at the map, images swirling
M	CNN METEOROLOGIST	Hurricane Lorraine, currently rated category four, expected to hit landfall by tomorrow evening. Making the situation even more frightening, that area of Texas currently in the midst of its worst tornado season in history. Tornado images appear on the map.
M	CNN METEOROLOGIST	And here's where it gets interesting. A black swarm graphic appears as well.
M	CNN METEOROLOGIST	Add the looming cicada migration to the mix and no one knows just how devastating this storm could be.
M	WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST	Category four hurricane, an F-3 or "severe" tornado, billions upon billions of cicadas -- collectively now being termed a "category fifteen winged tornadocane".
M	KTFT METEOROLOGIST	Tornadocane.
M	KPRC ANCHOR	Tornadocane.
M	KLUG METEOROLOGIST	God really hates us now. The rain is deafening, the wind ridiculous. It's all Hartman
M	HARTMAN	And this time, the warnings were hard to ignore. One Galvestonian told us "tornados, we can handle. Hurricanes we can handle. Bugs we can handle. Put 'em all together and that's a storm I don't need to see". A wise man indeed. Something off to the side catches Hartman's eye -- it's a
M	HARTMAN	Oooh! Get that! Steve gets the shot then pretends to make adjustments to his Mary digs in a KFC bag, takes out a handy wipe, starts
F	MARY	And when I met Steve, I knew right away we had a lot in common. We're both in the media, we both love crosswords, we both love words. We both felt this unexplainable connection, no matter how much his instinct might be to fight it. That's okay. We just have to get to know each other better, that's all. She uses the wipe on her face, gets a bit on her lip and the
F	MARY	Crap. She starts the handy wipe bath all over again. A nervous
M	HOWARD	I saw Steve talking to you... He wasn't very nice. Mary makes herself busy putting the handy wipe in her Kroger
F	MARY	If there's one thing I learned from crossword puzzles it's that you can't give up. Sometimes you run into a doozy and you think you'll never be able to solve it in a million years. If you quit, you're right, but if you stick with it, you'll figure it out. Eventually. She looks at Howard.
F	MARY	I have to give it one more try. I have to fix the mess I made with his work, then maybe he and I -- For the first time, she doesn't seem so sure. Howard
M	HOWARD	You know what my favorite part of doing crosswords is? When you know something you didn't think you knew. Mary thinks about it, then turns back to looking out the
F	MARY	Me too.
M	HARTMAN	Paula, this pier was closed to the public twenty-four hours ago, and for good reason. Steve inches a bit closer for the shot, his footing unstable.
M	HARTMAN	As I stand here, I can actually feel the structure moving under my feet. The only thing between me and the limitless depths of the sea is this two-by-four railing that - The railing flies off. Hartman drops to his knees and crawls Steve signals,to Hartman to wrap it up fast. Hartman talks
M	HARTMAN	And Paula I have to tell you, not only has my hearing been permanently damaged by the sheer force of the rain hitting my eardrums, but at this point, I'm beginning to wonder if I'll even make it out alive. He raises his head up for the big finish, gets hammered by
M	HARTMAN	This is Hartman Hughes, reporting live from Galveston, Texas. Steve and Josh start backing up off the pier with Hartman
M	STEVE	You had to get the pier shot. Had to. Just about got us all killed. Happy? Hartman points in the water, yells. Steve jumps, looks to where Hartman is pointing -- it's a
M	STEVE	You're such an asshole. Steve walks off the pier mad as hell.
M	HARTMAN	Come on, that was funny. You have to admit... Stevie?
M	HOWARD	Hang on. He hits the brakes, starts backing up as quickly as possible.
F	MARY	Oh my God. Howard backs under an overpass, points to a protected area up
M	HOWARD	We'll just have to wait for this to pass, then we'll keep going. It'll be okay. They look down to the road just in time to see Howard's car
F	MARY	Crap!
F	MR. HOROWITZ	She's fine. She's fine.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	This is all your fault.
F	MR. HOROWITZ	I know.
M	GIRL'S VOICE	Steve... Oh Steve... Steve awakens in panic. Steve looks at the person in front of him -- it's a scared
M	STEVE	Who the hell are you? What are you doing?
M	MEXICAN BOY	They pay me twenty dollar to wake you. Steve looks outside the van, sees Doug and Hartman laughing
M	STEVE	You seen her?
M	ANGUS	She's too smart to come here during this. Steve looks around like he's crazy.
M	STEVE	No, she's here somewhere. I can feel it.
F	MARY	I spy with my little eye a chemical element from group two of the periodic table. Howard points to a discarded fireworks casing at their feet.
M	HOWARD	Barium... I spy with my little She barely has the energy to get the word out.
F	MARY	Cobalt. Mary points to a steel belted tire on the ground, lays back
F	MARY	Mother Teresa.
M	HOWARD	My best seller. I'm an apple sculptor. She's quiet for once. Howard watches her drift off.
M	HOWARD	I went to school for physics but got bored. Now I just make these and sell them on appleheadsrule.com. I was going to give that one to my girlfriend in Bangor but I can make her another one. She'd probably prefer a Stephen Hawking one anyway. Science is her life. Not like my girlfriend in Tacoma. She's really into Jesus. Same as my other girlfriend in Duluth. He waits for a response - nothing.
M	HOWARD	Maybe I'll meet them in person one day. They're just so far away and I don't get out much, not farther than the apple orchard or the post office anyway.
F	MARY	But you're out now. He's a bit surprised she was listening.
M	HOWARD	I saw the people on TV fighting for Baby Peggy. It wasn't far from my house, and the people there looked nice enough, so I went. I thought I had everything I needed at home but then I thought, maybe there's more.
F	MARY	Maybe there is.
M	HOWARD	Can I tell you something? Mary nods.
M	HOWARD	I like your eyeballs.
F	MARY	They're fuscous, that means -
M	HOWARD	Brownish gray. I know. They both smile.
F	MARY	You know what I'd call this?
M	HOWARD	Quagmire?
F	MARY	Imbroglio, Howard. That means we're screwed.
M	CORBITT	Storm's over. What else is happening? The Exec shrugs and yawns.
M	BUSINESSMAN	Sloooowww news day.
M	FIRST REPORTER	Fire, a car chase, anything?
M	SECOND REPORTER	There is nothing going on, man. Nada.
M	TEACHER	Who's ready for some fun? The deaf kids start running down the hill, straight for the Just when they're close enough to smell the goats, tground
M	CNN ANCHOR	An abandoned mine shaft on the outskirts of Eunice, Louisiana. The children, apparently all hearing impaired, enjoying a trip' to the county fair, blissfully unaware of the danger that lay ahead.
M	FOX NEWS ANCHOR	No word yet on injuries. No word on when, or if, rescuers will be able to reach the special needs children. Well continue to bring you news as this tragic story unfolds.
M	HARTMAN	Tornadocane my ass. Where the hell were the cicadas? Retards in a mine shaft, now that's a story.
M	STEVE	They're deaf, asshole. They spot Mary and Howard up ahead in the ditch, next to the
M	HARTMAN	Look, it's your girlfriend.
M	STEVE	We're not stopping. Hartman grabs a piece of paper, writes fast.
M	ANGUS	We can't just leave them.
M	STEVE	Highway patrol's down here every hour. It's not like they'll rot in the ditch. As they get closer, Hartman rolls down his window, folds up
M	STEVE	What the hell are you doing?
M	HARTMAN	Getting some fresh air. It helps my pores. Steve tries to grab the paper.
M	STEVE	Hughes!
M	HARTMAN	Yes, Steven?
M	STEVE	You're not telling her where we're going.
M	HARTMAN	Aren't I? Hartman leans out the window with the paper, waves it around.
M	ANGUS	Christ, you two. You'll get us killed. Angus leans into the front seat, tries to steady the steering
M	STEVE	Asshole! Hartman laughs, rubs his arm in pain.
F	MARY	"Eunice, Louisiana. Please..." She stops reading, looks a bit uneasy. Howard steps forward,
M	HOWARD	"Please meet..." He looks at Mary, disgusted, continues reading.
M	HOWARD	M-E-A-T. "Please meat me there. XO Steve". See? He needs me, if only to help with his spelling.
M	HOWARD	No kidding. She rushes to the car, Howard joins her. They push the car ey At the edge of the fair grounds, the ferris wheel casts a
M	HARTMAN	And what went through your mind when you realized they were gone? The Teacher just bawls. Hartman turns to the camera.
M	HARTMAN	Grief too strong for words. That's the best way to describe this tragic, tragic scene. One minute, a merry day at the fair. The next minute, helpless babes savagely sucked into the menacing abyss. The Teacher bawls even harder. Hartman gives her a "there
M	HARTMAN	And here's how hopeless the rescue looks at this moment. The earth surrounding hole is far too perilous for anybody to approach on foot. Moving heavy rescue equipment in too close could mean death for the rescuers as well. Its cold down there, wet, dark, probably a few snakes and rats moving around. If the hearing impaired children even survived the fall, they're undoubtedly dealing with serious injuries, although some may have had their fall cushioned by their deaf brothers and sisters who dropped before them. Nevertheless, they've got to be in complete misery. Even if one them is telling the next "it'll be okay", it's not like he, or she, can hear a word of it. I don't know what the hell happened but I smell a lawsuit.
M	HARTMAN	To some, a simple crane. To the trapped, innocent, special children -- the answer to their prayers. The cable lowering the bucket jerks and stops. The crowd
M	HARTMAN	Or is it? The cable jerks and begins moving again.
M	HARTMAN	Only time will tell. Through the crowd, Steve sees a WOMAN who looks like Mary
F	MARY	Please let those kids be okay. Steve steps a bit closer to the hole with his camera.
M	RESCUER	Hey! Buddy! Back it up. Steve backs up, refocuses on the hole as the cable rises. Finally, a smiling little face appears being carried up by the Fireman.
M	FIREMAN	They're all okay! The rescuers cheer. The Teachers bawl.
M	HARTMAN	Elation here in Louisiana but the danger, far from over as rescuers bring these children up one grubby little face at a time. Hartman looks off to the side, holds up a finger like he's
M	HARTMAN	Remind me next time to mention Jesus. Still on the lookout for Mary, Steve's not even listening.
F	MARY	George, Lydia! What's going on? Lydia hugs her.
M	PROTESTOR WIFE / LYDIA	They got eleven out. All fine, thank God. More coming up. The Fireman brings up another one. As he's raised to ground
M	FIREMAN	That's the last of them! As he hands the kid to safety, the cable jerks. He gets out She glances toward the rescue site and spots Steve on the far
M	HARTMAN	A happy ending that's left parents across this country wondering - how can I keep my family safe from abandoned mines? Are there abandoned mines in my backyard? Is my child's school built on top of an abandoned mine? Steve spots Mary, running toward him.
M	STEVE	No, no, no.
M	HARTMAN	And how, oh how, can these death traps be avoided? Mary drops right into the abandoned mine.
M	CNN ANCHOR	Mary Horowitz. A painful high school photo of Mary appears on the screen.
M	NEWS ANCHOR	Mary Horowitz.
M	ANOTHER NEWS ANCHOR	Mary Horowitz.
M	CORBITT (O.S.)	Shame about your girlfriend in the pit, Steve, but we've got the inside advantage here so let's use it. Steve shakes his head, not impressed. Angus takes the phone off speaker, steps aside to talk to
M	STEVE	Mrs. Horowitz.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	We're coming! Tell her to hang on! Mr. Horowitz runs down the stairs with luggage and Carol the
M	STEVE	You and your husband stay put, Mrs. Horowitz. They'll have her out before you even make it to the airport... She'll be fine. I promise. He hangs up, looks at Hartman.
M	STEVE	She better be. Hartman looks away, guilty.
F	MARY	Eight letter word for... my life has come to this. There's a bit of shuffling around in the dark.
F	MARY	Not destiny, that's only seven letters. Not fortuity - that sounds more like when good things happen to people like finding a quarter in the sofa or something. I mean the not so great stuff that's bound to befall some people more than others. Fate's nasty cousin, I mean. Suddenly Mary's face lights up with her mini keychain
F	MARY	F-O-R-E-D-0-0-M. Foredoom.
M	A	Mary shines the light on her knee. Her previous cut is now
F	MARY	Crap.
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	The new equipment is going to take a while. Let's try and find out what kind of shape our victim's in.
M	RESCUER	Can we lower a phone down in there?
M	MINE SAFETY EXPERT	Not at those depths, this whole area is bad enough above ground. We'll never get a signal down there.
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	Let's keep it simple. Get me a flashlight, a piece of paper and a pencil. An unenthusiastic Hartman steps in front of the camera, the
M	HARTMAN	Behind inc... Oh what's the point? Hartman walks away moping.
M	ANGUS	Corbitt wants you to go on air to talk about Mary. An interview with the boyfriend.
M	STEVE	I'm not her boyfriend!
M	ANGUS	Close enough. Come on, we need this. Hartman steps up, listens in.
M	ANGUS	Fox has already got their hands on everything but her panty size.
M	HARTMAN	Fox scooped us? Our Mary? The bastards. Steve glares at him.
M	RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR	That area was never reinforced up above, no need since the whole eastern tunnel was blocked off in the late Seventies. Of course that would also affect the air quality down there.
M	ANCHOR	That has to be bad news for Mary Horowitz, wouldn't you say?
M	RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR	Definitely not looking good.
F	MRS. HOROWITZ	Who are these people?
M	SLICK JOURNALIST	Mary Horowitz, described by those who know her as smart, talkative, very much the girl next door, that is, if the girl next door has a genius level IQ. She's worked for eleven years as the crossword constructor for the Atlanta Citizen and lives right here with her parents. Mr. Horowitz opens the door an is swarmed by Reporters. The
F	MR. HOROWITZ	No, Mary doesn't live with us. She just came over one day and won't leave, but she has her own place.
M	SLICK JOURNALIST	Can you comment on the rumors that Mary's fall into the mine was a suicide attempt?
F	MR. HOROWITZ	That's ridiculous. Not our Mary. The word depression isn't in her vocabulary. Well, it's in her vocabulary, obviously, but no, nothing ever gets her down. Steady as a rock, that one.
F	MARY	I am not afraid. I am not fearful, pusillanimous, nor am I affrighted. Suddenly in the light - a face. Mary screams her head off.
F	MARY	Oh my God, they forgot one! You scared the crap out of me. The girl just stares at her.
F	MARY	I'm sorry, can you hear me, I mean at all? Do you have sensorineural hearing loss or conductive? "Deaf people can do anything except hear." You know who said that? Doctor Jordan, first deaf President of Gallaudet U. Maybe you'll go there one day. That is, unless we perish down here. Mary smiles. The Little Deaf Girl just stares back.
M	YOUNG RESCUER	What should we say?
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	Tell her help is on the way. We just need her to confirm she's conscious -- here, give me that. The Supervisor grabs the paper and pencil, scribbles the They look up to the thin nylon rope now in place of the The crane swings over, lowers the rope into the hole.
F	MARY	And then there's black lung disease, also a problem in coal mines. Chronic cough, breathlessness, cyanosis - that's where your skin turns purple -- There's a CLINK behind Mary. She turns her light onto the
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	That's a good sign right there. The Young Rescuer grabs the note.
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	What's it say?
M	UNFOLDS	The rescue team gathers around. The Young Rescuer
M	YOUNG RESCUER	"I think you mean, am i conscious, not am I conscience."
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	Jesus Christ.
M	YOUNG RESCUER	"Conscious means alert and awake. Conscience is your inner morality gauge, you know, the thing that stops you from doing bad things, e.g. killing, stealing, harming helpless animals, and whatnot."
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	Can we leave her down there? He motions for the Rescuer to continue.
M	YOUNG RESCUER	"To answer your question, yes I am conscious. My leg is bleeding but I'll probably live."
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	Great.
M	YOUNG RESCUER	"Yours truly, Mary Horowitz." The other rescuers start to disperse.
M	RESCUER	"P.S. Did anybody lose a little deaf girl?" The rescuers stop in their tracks.
M	RESCUER	"I found one. She's fine... Other than not being able to hear, I mean."
M	FOX NEWS ANCHOR	Breaking news from Louisiana, we've just received word that abandoned mine victim Mary Horowitz is alive. Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz watch the "Alive!" news coverage. Mrs. The mine coverage continues.
M	FOX NEWS ANCHOR	Also in the mine, a hearing impaired child overlooked in the earlier rescue. Speculation now as to whether or not Mary Horowitz intentionally heaved herself into the mine to save the child after rescuers ignored her pleas.
M	NANCY GRACE	They missed a child? They missed a child? Can't these people count? Thank goodness for this woman, this Mary Horowitz - let's bring up that picture of her again. The picture of Mary appears on the monitor.
M	NANCY GRACE	We're looking at an American hero, folks. It it wasn't for Mary Horowitz, the child would have never been found.
M	STEVE	Thank Christ. Now if they can only get her out of there. Angus hangs up his phone.
M	ANGUS	Corbitt wants you on in five. Steve sees he has no choice. He nods. Hartman puts an arm
M	HARTMAN	I'll be gentle.
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	We've got the whole country watching now, can't afford any more mistakes. The crane from Shreveport is a wash. We're looking at as much as sixteen hours to bring the other one in.
M	MINE SAFETY EXPERT	Sixteen hours? If we've got carbon monoxide -
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	There's air coming in through the top.
M	MINE SAFETY EXPERT	Even at a concentration of 5ppm, they could suffocate... We do not have sixteen hours. The Rescue supervisor looks toward the hole, of the severity
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	Let's at least get some food and water down there. The rope we've got on there now will handle a small load -- if that damn crane holds. He looks up at the old crane, worried.
M	MINE SAFETY EXPERT	Gas masks, oxygen supply, how long? The Rescue Supervisor points around the area - look where we
M	RESCUE SUPERVISOR	As fast as we can get them here.
M	MINE SAFETY EXPERT	Might not be soon enough.
M	- this	The Retired Mine Supervisor is back with a new graphic
M	RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR	They're pretty much done. Howard stands at the barrier looking more worried than
F	ELIZABETH	Howard! She hugs him.
M	HOWARD	She'll be okay. She will. Howard looks behind him at the ever growing crowd.
M	HOWARD	All this. For her. He manages a sad smile.
M	FOX NEWS ANCHOR	The question on everybody's mind tonight is, who is Mary Horowitz? Atlanta affiliate WAGA looks into the mind of an everyday hero. WAGA Reporter CINDY emotes like her life depends on it.
M	WAGA CINDY	No one will argue that the city of Atlanta has always been a breeding ground for heroes. Jimmy Carter, Hank Aaron, Ryan Seacrest and now... Mary Horowitz. As the country wonders about what would drive this woman to such an extraordinary act, we went straight to those closest to her.
M	NERVOUS OLD LADY	Mary Horowitz was one of my second grade students. Brilliant girl... Darling. Always a smart dresser as I remember. And she once brought me soup when I wasn't well.
M	WAGA CINDY	Mary Horowitz, a hero who's devoted her life to caring for the sick and elderly. Clearly a woman with a higher purpose.
M	FEMALE REPORTER	Exactly like the boots worn by Mary Horowitz when she slipped into the mine. Were the boots responsible for the accident? The manufacturer refuses to comment. For now, the deadly footwear remains on store shelves, leaving consumers to pay the ultimate price. banner underneath reads "NOW BANNED IN 4
M	FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL	Oh my God, we so have to have them!
F	MARY	Rhinolith, that's the real word. Rhino is nose, lithos means stone. Nose stone. You know what that is? Snot.
M	SCIENTIST	I knew Mary Horowitz in college. She caught me trying to cheat off her physics midterm, lectured me for an hour and when she finally stopped talking I asked her out. She said no, said it was because I was, get this - hebetudinous. Can you believe? He walks away, bitter, gets back to work on NASA rockets.
M	RESEARCHER	We dated for a while but she ended it. Said she couldn't stand this - He points around 'to the library - you could hear a pin drop.
M	RESEARCHER	Whatever that means.
M	WAGA CINDY	A heartbreaker, leaving behind a trail of devastation.
F	MARY	And Archimedes, there's another one. He was into math, philosophy, all kinds of stuff, then one day he was working out an equation in the sand and somebody stabbed him. Crappy, I know.
M	HARTMAN	Steve, tell us about Mary, your fiance struggling for her life at the bottom of the abandoned mine as we speak. Steve glares at him. Hartman motions for him to go on.
M	STEVE	Mary... she's smart, incredibly smart. She talks a lot. Never boring, I'll tell you that much. He thinks about her, gets lost in it.
M	STEVE	Mary Horowitz doesn't pretend to be anything she's not. She's passionate, beautiful, real... and she definitely doesn't deserve to be where she is now. An ELDERLY COUPLE hands Howard and Elizabeth candles. Howard
M	HOWARD	They don't even know her.
M	ELDERLY LADY	No, but they know what it's like to be alone, to need a helping hand. That's a good enough reason to be here. The Rescue Supervisor watches, anxious and helpless. The
F	MARY	Happenstance, I love that word too. And you know what else - Mary coughs. Before she has a chance to catch her breath, a
F	MARY	No dessert. Crappy. Did you know that the word dessert comes from an old French word that means "clear the table"? Sometimes I feel like dinner is just doing time so I can get to the point, and of course the point always involves sugar. Who The Little Deaf Girl covers her ears, vocalizes as much as
M	LITTLE DEAF GIRL	Shut up! I can't hear you but you talk a lot. Totally catches Mary off guard. She fully takes that in.
F	MARY	I know. She sits down.
F	MARY	I know. She notices the Little Girl's shoes are soaked. Mary moves her side, then speaks like she's a different person
F	MARY	I'm not good at... silence. "Mary doesn't do quiet", that's how my grandmother always said it. "What's that hush?" she'd holler at a party. "It's Mary about to talk", then she'd laugh and laugh and laugh. Everybody would... But I knew something they didn't - that if you keep talking, if you keep on talking, you don't hear people telling you that you're different. You don't hear people saying they don't like you. And if you're talking, you just might not hear it when some kid... calls you a freak. Mary's eyes start to well.
F	MARY	I just wanted to be normal, that's all. Steve said I was. She thinks about it, laughs a bit.
F	MARY	I'm beginning to think newsmen can't entirely be trusted. She buttons up the Little Girl's sweater.
F	MARY	The truth is normal is -- not me. She seems surprised she said it out loud. There's relief in
F	MARY	My friends, the people I've met over the past week, they're not normal either. They're more interesting, more original, more real, more rare. She suddenly gets it, brightens up.
F	MARY	That's where I fit. - and for She thinks about it, in silence. The sadness fades She smiles at the Little Deaf Girl. The Little Deaf Girl

M	CNN ANCHOR	A tense night in Eunice, Louisiana. Hartman what can you tell us?
M	HARTMAN	They've lowered food and water into the depths of this abandoned mine. The last task of this archaic crane that finally blew its motor. We've been told the new rescue equipment won't make it until daybreak. Until then, all we can do is wait, hope, and of course pray. There's a commotion at the rescue site. Doug zooms in. The rope hanging into the hole is moving. Rescuers get as
