M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	CAROLINE	Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday, March 10, 2011. Female Test subject Number four. Franklin reaches for us, smiles...
M	FRANKLIN	Here we go, Bright eyes. A MIST fogs our view for a moment.
F	CAROLINE	Not too much. She needs to be calm, but alert.
M	VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM	Go ahead - send her through. A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.
M	WILL	Start the scan. A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.
M	TECHIE	Scanning.
M	DONNIE	Stuff looks like Kool-aid.
F	CAROLINE	Go ahead, I'm sure you could use it. Starting the therapy...
M	FRANKLIN	She's convulsing. Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright Please keep the monkey still. He focuses back on the monitor.
M	CAROLINE (INTERCOM)	She's not a monkey. Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
M	CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)	She's an ape. Chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, they're all apes.
M	WILL	Good to know. Just keep it from moving. She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
M	TECHIE	Here we go. Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
M	WILL	We're on our way. Good work.
F	CAROLINE	What is this? Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who Bright Eyes presses a button.
M	ELECTRONIC VOICE	Tree. Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.
F	CAROLINE	And this? The chimp presses another button.
M	ELECTRONIC VOICE	Acorn.
F	CAROLINE	Where does the acorn come from? Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.
M	ELECTRONIC VOICE	Acorn.
F	CAROLINE	Yes, but where does the acorn come from?
M	ELECTRONIC VOICE	Acorn. Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.
M	ELECTRONIC VOICE	Acorn. Tree. Acorn. The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
M	ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)	Surprise. The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
F	CAROLINE	We started the therapy four weeks ago. This was yesterday. Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.
M	CAROLINE (CONT'D)	There's been clear cell growth. Both on the frontal lobe and the neocortex. She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
M	WILL	I see that. But I don't understand the primate behavioral norms. She knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't any monkey know that?
F	CAROLINE	No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives us a tree, which gives us an acorn.
M	WILL	Abstract thought...
F	CAROLINE	In a chimpanzee. Unheard of. Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
M	CAROLINE (CONT'D)	You're calling her a monkey just to piss me off, aren't you?
M	WILL	Start the other's on the 112. And double this one's dose. He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
M	WILL	Hey Dad. Walter looks up, whispers...
M	WALTER	John... is that you?
M	WILL	It's me. Will.
M	WALTER	As thou dost, Anthony. .he hears no music. No music...
M	VOICE	He's been doing that all day. A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.
F	IRENA	He found an old book of his. She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
M	IRENA (CONT'D)	I had no idea you liked Shakespeare so much, Mr. Walter.
M	WILL	My mother was the one. She liked Shakespeare... Good night, Walter, hone-ee. She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.
M	I WILL	Come on, Dad.
M	WILL	Remember I told you we were using Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on the apes? Well the therapy seems to be working. We've seen definite signs of adult brain neurogenesis. Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Board of Directors is coming in a couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 - that's clinical trials. Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Human trials, Dad. Soon.
M	WALTER	I rather tell that what is to be feared than what I fear: for always... I am Caesar... There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..
M	WILL	I'm going to make you better - I swear it. His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?
M	WALTER	John... ? No, Dad, it's me. Will. Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	John's gone. He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
M	FRANKLIN	Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam. Monty. Hey - what's the matter, don't like my cooking? He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
M	FRANKLIN (CONT'D)	You okay back there?
F	CAROLINE	Something wrong with Bright Eyes?
M	FRANKLIN	I'll check on her when we're done. Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
M	JACOBS	You could at least try to look excited. Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
M	WILL	I'm not good with this stuff. Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.
M	JACOBS	You'll do fine. Just speak English. Keep the science simple.
F	CAROLINE	Okay. Back it out...
M	DONNIE	Your turn. Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO
M	DONNIE (CONT'D)	C'mon - Let go - She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S
M	DONNIE (CONT'D)	Hey! Something's wrong with number four! Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
M	FRANKLIN	Be right over - Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
M	DONNIE	What's the matter with you? Alzheimer's affects the entire neocortex, the hippocampus, and large subcortical regions of the brain...
M	DONNIE	Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.
M	DONNIE (CONT'D)	Someone get her off of me!
F	CAROLINE	Hang on - Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
M	WILL	In the past, it's been impossible to target specific areas, both because of the Blood Brain Barrier - Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.
M	JACOBS	What Dr. Rodman has done is to invent a virus that can, for the first time, cross the membrane that protects the brain and deliver a genetic, therapeutic, payload.
M	WILL	This 'payload' would directly affect the areas of memory, higher function - and, of course, the motherlode: intelligence. The board members stare, trying to comprehend.
M	BOARD MEMBER	Meaning?
M	WILL	Meaning. If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're looking at a cure for Alzheimer's. With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
M	DONNIE	She's breaking my hand!
F	CAROLINE	Let go, Bright Eyes! You're hurting him! She tries to help pull Donnie away.
M	CAROLINE (CONT'D)	Let go! In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.
M	FRANKLIN	Lucky no! Stop! Hit the alarm! Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.
M	GUARD #1	Uh oh. Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN
M	GUARD #2	Hey, Len...? Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
M	BOARD MEMBER	What about the safety of the virus?
M	WILL	Perfectly safe. We're using the most stable - A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
M	NO!	Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK. Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams - He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.
M	WILL	Are they gone?
M	JACOBS	Long gone. Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.
M	WILL	Did they say anything before they left? I mean, about Phase 2.
M	JACOBS	Look around you, for Christ sakes. We'll be lucky if we don't go to jail. Will's gutted - devastated.
M	WILL	But we're so close.
M	JACOBS	You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here? I've got my own skin in this game!
M	WILL	with the 112. Take an already aggressive animal, make it smarter - you're going to get a potentially dangerous
M	JACOBS	What makes you so damned positive about that? What if this drug does things you don't understand? Are you going to take responsibility for that? Because I'm sure as hell not going to. Here Will hesitates.
M	JACOBS (CONT'D)	We're not ready for human trials. Hell, we weren't ready for monkey trials.
M	WILL	They're apes.
M	JACOBS	This is what we're going to do: You're taking a sabbatical. I'll let the board handle the lawsuit. When this blows over I'll bring you back and we'll start over - we'll do it right this time. With mice. Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody. Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say. His work - destroyed.
M	Â¢ FRANKLIN	Show you something, boss?
M	WILL	I don't work here anymore, Franklin.
M	FRANKLIN	I just put down fifteen animals, Dr. Rodman. The least you could do is give me a moment of your time. Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
M	WILL	of course. It's a creepy, horrible scene.
M	FRANKLIN	They're all gone.
M	WILL	I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely sorry... What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
M	CHIMPANZEE.	Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	It's impossible. How could a full- term gestation go unnoticed?
M	FRANKLIN	They carry small. Must have been pregnant when they brought her in. Will tries to get his mind around the situation.
M	WILL	Who else knows about this?
M	FRANKLIN	No one. I'd bring him home, but my brother- in-law works for security. He'd rat me out in a second. That's when will realizes.
M	WILL	You want me to take him?
M	FRANKLIN	He's an orphan now.
M	WILL	I could be thrown in jail. He's a chimpanzee who's been exposed to a possibly dangerous drug.
M	FRANKLIN	You don't believe that.
M	WILL	Doesn't matter what I believe.
M	FRANKLIN	Just for a couple days. Until I can find a sanctuary.
M	WILL	That's not possible.
M	FRANKLIN	I heard you outside, fighting to keep them alive.
M	WILL	I was talking about the work, my
M	FRANKLIN	she was just trying to protect him.
M	WILL	What?
M	FRANKLIN	Bright Eyes - the mother. That's why she wouldn't let anyone into her cage. Will looks down at the helpless baby.
M	WILL	I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry - but there's nothing I can do here. He's got to be put down like the others.
M	FRANKLIN	Tell you what, Doc. I'm done for the day. So you be my guest. Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will. Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
M	WILL	Two days. Then you have to figure it out. Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
M	TEEN CASHIER	Hey man. Congratulations.
M	WILL	Huh? Oh. Thanks.
F	IRENA	It's Friday night. I had a date.
M	WILL	I'm sorry - there was - She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
M	WILL	It's okay. It's going to be okay. Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit. A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH. There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
M	WILL (O.S.)	Caesar! Breakfast! The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR. AGES 12 and up. 12 and up. Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
M	WILL	Please pass the ketchup. Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Thanks.
M	CAESAR	You're welcome. NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there
M	LAB TECH	Is he going to turn left or right...? The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
M	WILL	There it is. Restored cognitive function.
M	LAB TECH	Same success rate as the primates. Congratulations.
M	Â¢ STEWART	He's right on target. Height. Weight... She checks Caesar's ears.
M	CAESAR	Dairy Queen.
M	WILL	After. Sit still.
M	STEWART	What about diet?
M	WILL	A healthy diet. Fruits, vegetables.
M	CAESAR	Ice cream. Will ignores him.
M	STEWART	What's he saying?
M	WILL	He's hungry. Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
M	STEWART	He seems extremely intelligent. How many words does Caesar sign? Beat.
M	WILL	You know, the basics.
M	CAESAR	Soft-serve.
M	STEWART	I've heard of apes learning up to a hundred and fifty words. Is he good with puzzles? Will hesitates.
M	WILL	He's pretty good.
M	STEWART	Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously happy. You're doing a great job with him. But there is an anomaly I noticed.
M	WILL	Like what?
M	STEWART	When I was examining his eyes, I noticed a strange green pigmentation.
M	WILL	Green? His heart starts to pound.
M	STEWART	Green. Never.seen it before. She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	Take a look. Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	It's faint, can you pick it up? He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	You alright? Want a glass of water?
M	WILL	No thanks. Sure, that would be good. She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Forgot to eat today. Not a big deal. Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it. I'm fine. Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.
M	STEWART	Carotid pulse is running a little fast.
M	WILL	For a human or a chimpanzee? First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.
M	STEWART	Gotta remember to eat.
M	WILL (O.S.)	You have to move the whole tower to another peg, one block at a time.
M	WILL	Here's the hard part: you can't put a larger block on top of a smaller one. Caesar studies the puzzle.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Understand? Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his He did it in fifteen moves.
F	IRENA	What's the best score?
M	WILL	Fifteen. Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall. I wonder where he gets such talent?
M	WILL	It was passed down from his mother.
M	WILL	At age two Caesar appears to exceed his mother's aptitude. He signs over three hundred words. He exhibits no visible side effects from the therapy...
M	WILL	Dad. I've got something that's going to make you better. Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...
M	WILL	You want turkey or ham?
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Ham! The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face. Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
M	TODD'S BUDDY	Check it. He wants to play. Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
M	TODD	Monkey in the middle. Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
M	WALTER	Caesar!
M	WILL	He won't go far.
M	WALTER	You don't know that.
M	WILL	I do, Dad.
M	TODD AND FRIEND	Monkey in the middle, monkey in the middle... Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep- They're making fun of him. "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
M	HUNSIKER	Hah! Hah - Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
M	WILL	Hold on - it's okay - he's harmless!
M	HUNSIKER	Your monkey came onto my property! Threatened my kids! By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
M	WILL	It won't happen again...
M	HUNSIKER	Damn right it won't happen again! I'll press charges if it does! Will holds Caesar close and hurries home. What does he do for fun? Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
M	WILL	Well we've got puzzles, games, a swing set...
M	STEWART	My guess is he needs more. More exercise, more space.
M	WILL	We'll work on that. Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen He gets up his nerve. What about you? What do you do for fun? She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
M	WILL (CONT'D)	How about dinner and a movie? Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.
M	STEWART	I'm sorry, did you say something? He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.
M	WILL	No - nothing. Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
M	WALTER	Take him off the leash.
M	Â¢ WILL	There's a place up ahead.
M	WILL	Don't go far. Stay where I can see you. Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then Remember - stay where I can see you - if you got lost in these woods I'd never find you.
M	WALTER	Go ahead. Climb! The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy Will's pointing to his watch. â¢ CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
M	WILL	Sorry to rush you - got to get home and check on Walter. They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT Is that a chimpanzee?
M	WILL	Don't worry - he's harmless. Very sweet. The big dog keeps BARKING. Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE, Guess he had it coming. Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?
M	WILL	Where's Dr. Stewart?
M	S VETERINARIAN	She doesn't work here anymore. Doesn't work here anymore?
M	WILL	Do you know where she went?
M	VETERINARIAN	I'm sorry - I don't. Will's deeply disappointed. They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE. Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
M	WILL	Come on. As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
M	LIKE ALPHA'S.	He runs two fingers down the length of it. Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
M	WILL	Turn it around, Dad. You're using the wrong end. Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending. With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the Will watches. Heartbroken. He backs away from the cone. A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him, Will's obviously discouraged.
M	WILL	The drug's not staying ahead of the disease.
M	JACOBS	But we're still making progress, right? Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written
M	WILL	Sure. At this pace we'll get to trials by the time Hell freezes over. Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.
M	JACOBS	This isn't graduate school - there's a procedure we have to adhere to.
M	WILL	It'll take forever. I need to start developing a primate version now. Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.
M	JACOBS	How's your father? Haven't seen him in a while.
M	WILL	This isn't about him.
M	JACOBS	He's worse, isn't he? Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell He's fine.
M	WILL	Caesar continues to maintain a high level of cognition. But Walter's disease has caught up to the neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all initial improvement has been erased... Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.
M	CAESAR	Who Caesar.
M	WILL	What do you mean?
M	CAESAR	Who. With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and
M	CAESAR (CONT'D)	Who.
M	WILL	Caesar is an ape. A chimpanzee.
M	CAESAR	No "what". "Who". Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual
M	WILL	Are you asking about your identity? That's abstract thought, Caesar. Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'
M	CAESAR	Walter Will father. Will Caesar father? Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his This is where you were born. It's the place where I work.
M	WILL	I never knew your father, but your mother came to live here. This is where you were born.
M	CAESAR	Caesar mother?
M	WILL	She was very very smart. And she passed that onto you through her blood. Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.
M	CAESAR	Caesar go. Caesar see. Will locks the car door.
M	WILL	She's not here anymore. I'm sorry, Caesar - she died. That's when I brought you home to live with me and Walter. Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.
M	CAESAR	Caesar mother... Will grows concerned.
M	WILL	No. This is a bad place for you, Caesar. We're going to go now. As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Let's see if we can find something for you on the TV... The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a
M	TV REPORTER	The Icarus crew is led by Commander Colonel George Taylor. This is his fifth space mission... Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
M	HUNSIKER	Look at the front of my car you stupid, stupid old man! You should be locked up! Your son's going to pay for that damage - No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS
M	WALTER	Caesar... Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
M	HUNSIKER	Help! Get him off -
M	WALTER	Caesar... no... Stop! Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back. Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE
M	HUNSIKER	Aaaaaaaah! Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE
M	WALTER	Caesar! Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	Please stop. Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
M	HUNSIKER	Please no... Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph. He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing. All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.
M	REPORTER (V.0.)	.chimpanzee named Caesar, terrorizing the quiet family enclave and mauling neighbor Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for Global Airlines.
M	REPORTER	The defense claimed the chimp was merely trying to protect its owner from perceived aggression. FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews.
M	REPORTER (CONT'D)	The chimpanzee's distraught owner, Wilson Rodman, has raised the animal since he was an infant. He pleaded to keep Caesar at home, citing the ape's remarkable intelligence. Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.
M	WILL	We're visiting a place called "The Ranch". They have animals.
M	CAESAR	Real animals?
M	WILL	You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans... Caesar GRUNTS, excited.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	It'll be good. You'll like it very much. Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.
M	CAESAR	Will sad?
M	WILL	What? No, I'm fine. A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
M	CAESAR	Where animals? Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT
M	WILL	Inside, I think...
M	WILL	You must be Mr. Landon. This is Caesar.
M	MR. LANDON	Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is Dodge, helps me run the place.
M	WILL	I've been telling Caesar about the animals you have here. How much fun it is.
M	MR. LANDON	Yes, we have a big play center where the chimpanzees like to climb. Want to see the play center? Caesar nods. Absolutely. Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.
M	MR. LANDON	What do you think, Caesar? Want to give it a try? Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
M	WILL	Go ahead. He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-
M	LOCKING IT.	He braces himself. CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
M	WILL	It's okay, Caesar. It's going to be okay... The words are for him as much as Caesar. You're going to live here for a while. This is what the Judge says we have to do. WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
M	WILL (CONT'D)	They'll take good care of you here.
M	DODGE	That's about it for visiting hours. Will shoots him a look of daggers.
M	MR. LANDON	What Dodge means is, in our experience, longer you drag out the leave-taking, harder it is. On both of you. Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
M	WILL	I'm sorry to trick you this way, but you would never have agreed. I was afraid they'd hurt you if they forced you -
M	MR. LANDON	He'll be fine. Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
M	DODGE	Caesar. Hey. I can get you out. Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	This way. Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
M	DODGE	Caesar - over here. Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Stupid monkey. Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE, He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
M	DODGE (O.S.)	Okay, assholes. Dinner time. Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out. The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow. Bet you don't get none of that in the suburbs. Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Think that's funny? That funny to you, you hairy prick? Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.
M	RODNEY	Look at that! Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.
M	DODGE	One thing you can count on: Long as there are humans on this earth, you'll always be a monkey in a cage. The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards. The water BLAST is relentless. Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
M	RODNEY	What about his clothes? Might cause problems with the other apes.
M	DODGE	Leave 'em.
M	WALTER (O.S.)	John? Walter enters, looks at Will. John - where's Caesar? The old man looks stricken.
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't there something we can do? Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea. Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
M	JACOBS	You've been gone a week.
M	WILL	I was sick.
M	JACOBS	Too sick to return my calls? You know it was a funny thing, but I was watching the news and they started talking about a seven-year- old chimpanzee that went nuts - and all of a sudden, there you were on the TV. A seven year old chimp, raised since birth. The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
M	WILL	He's the son of chimp 4. And he's smart. Off-the-charts smart. Because of the 112. The genetic therapy was passed in utero - from the mother to the son. Without a single negative side-effect.
M	JACOBS	Aside from biting off a man's finger.
M	WILL	He was protecting my father. The same way his mother was protecting him.
M	JACOBS	We've had this conversation already. We knew the 112 was making the apes smart - I tried the 112 on my father. A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the I had a sample vial.
M	JACOBS	You're out of your mind. Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
M	WILL	Don't you want to know if it worked? Jacobs can't resist...
M	JACOBS	Did it?
M	WILL	It was miraculous. Unquestionable adult neurogenesis - development of fresh nerve tissue. It brought my father back. But Jacobs is confused.
M	JACOBS	You told me he was failing.
M	WILL	It's just like with the mice. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, you need to keep it at bay â¢ - you need boosters. Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the
M	JACOBS	Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
M	WILL	I couldn't risk losing him.
M	JACOBS	'Him'?
M	WILL	Caesar.
M	JACOBS	The ape? Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.
M	WILL	We've discovered a safe treatment. It's the payday you've been waiting for. I'll recreate the primate version of 112 for you. But only under one condition. It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.
M	JACOBS	You're giving me conditions? I could have you arrested for what you've done.
M	WILL	But you won't - you need me to build the drug. Here's what I need: I want you to get Caesar back. How the hell can I do that?
M	WILL	However they do things in your part of the world. Get attorneys into it. Write checks. Slip cash into the right pockets. Make it happen. Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty. The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK. They haven't noticed him yet. Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM. He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms. Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him. It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment. Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.
M	VOICE	Caesar. Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.
M	STEWART	Do you remember me? I'm Dr. Stewart. She hands him a cup of water with a straw.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	Drink. Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	I don't understand. Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
M	STEWART (CONT-D)	Can you show me? Show me what you need. Caesar pulls at the restraints.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	I can't take those off. Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	I'm sorry this has happened, Caesar. So sorry. Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	I'm here once a week. I'll do my best to look after you.
M	STEWART (O.S.)	What were you thinking?
M	DODGE	oh, hey Doc.
M	STEWART	That chimp needs protection. Dodge's face falls.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	You could've gotten him killed. I told Rodney not to open his cage.
M	STEWART	Can't you see how sensitive he is? How intelligent?
M	DODGE	Yeah, no, he's a real smart dresser.
M	STEWART	I want him moved to the orangutan house. He'll be safe there until we re-introduce him to the group.
M	DODGE	I'm sorry, since when do volunteer animal doctors make the rules around here?
M	STEWART	Please. Just do it.
M	DODGE	Whatever you say, doc. Dodge returns to stacking the chow.
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	You're the one with the college education.
M	VIRUS TECHNICIAN	Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a mistake. Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
M	VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)	I've double-checked the replication rate of the 113 - and it's enormously fast compared to the
M	WILL	That's why we're using it. We need the drug quickly.
M	VIRUS TECHNICIAN	But... isn't it risky? I mean, at this rate of propagation, we greatly increase the possibility of mutations that are out of our control. It's a highly unstable -
M	WILL	I appreciate your concern - but it's going to be fine. We plan on taking precautions. The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's
M	STEWART	Sorry to drop in on you like this. The clinic at the zoo gave me your address but they didn't have a phone number - Don't worry about it. You want to come in?
M	WILL	Can I - you want a cup of coffee or something?
M	STEWART	No - thanks. I just wanted to let you know that I've seen Caesar. Seen Caesar?
M	WILL	How?
M	STEWART	I volunteer once a week at The Ranch.
M	WILL	Is he alright? She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.
M	STEWART	Yeah. He had a rough start, but things should get smoother from now on... In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will
M	WILL	That's my dad. He's not doing too well.
M	STEWART	Oh. Sorry. Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay. I'm looking after him.
M	WILL	Thank you... I appreciate that. Awkward beat.
M	STEWART	Well. If you give me your number I'll let you know from time to time how things are going -
M	WILL	Let's grab a drink. Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.
M	STEWART	Love to. ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck, Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.
M	DODGE	Want a beer? The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away. Here's a little taste of beer... He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH. Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE
M	DODGE & RODNEY	Move it! Let's go! Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE, Caesar maneuvers to get a better view. His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
M	WILL	There you are! I heard what happened. Home now. Caesar home. He tugs Will away from Dodge.
M	WILL	I'm going to get you out of here, but not today. I'm working on it. Caesar's face falls.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Soon. I promise. Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD. Home. Still a question, a flicker of hope.
M	WILL	Not yet. I can't yet. Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Wait a second - Caesar, where are you going? â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
M	DODGE	No place like home, huh monkey boy?
M	WILL	Caesar - come back here! He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
M	WILL	You son of a bitch. Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.
M	DODGE	That was not a smart thing to do. Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
M	WILL	If I find out Caesar's been hurt, if he's mistreated in any way, I swear I'll have you brought up on charges. Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.
M	DODGE	That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours any more. He's mine now. The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	And you're on private property. Now get the hell out of here.
M	WILL	Forget jail. I'll come back and kill you.
M	STEWART (O.S.)	Morning Caesar.
M	STEWART	How's your arm? Mind if I take a look? Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	Looking good... Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	I'm taking him out. Thought I'd cheer him up, show him the horses.
M	DODGE	No way. As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.
M	STEWART	What are you going to do? Use a cattle prod on me?
M	DODGE	If you're into that kind of thing.
M	STEWART	I'm safer with him than I am with you.
M	DODGE	Answer's no. Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.
M	STEWART	I can't take you. Maybe another time. Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
M	WILL	Which one of you wants chocolate... Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	"Koba." He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL Then he puts out his hand again.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Nanotherapy, beta version: Male Test Subject Number eleven. All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes. Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he? Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
M	STEWART	You actually punched him?
M	WILL	I did. She thinks it's funny.
M	STEWART	I've been wanting to do that since the day I met him.
M	WILL	I don't advise it. My hand's killing me.
M	STEWART	Here. Let me help you out. She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his
M	WILL	I'm going to get him out of there.
M	STEWART	I know you are.
M	WILL	And I'm going to get my dad back too. Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him... The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step. Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom. He makes his way to the ape houses.
F	MAURICE	Happy gorilla. Caesar's shocked.
M	MAURICE (CONT'D)	Surprise.
M	CAESAR	Signing orangutan.
F	MAURICE	Maurice circus orangutan.
M	CAESAR	More ape sign?
F	MAURICE	No. Maurice alone. They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.
M	CAESAR	Careful. Stupid human no like smart ape. Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs. Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR; The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
M	LOCKS HIM IN.	Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
M	WILL	Hold him steady! Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	You okay Evans?
M	EVANS	Yeah. I'm good.
M	WILL	You can't put larger blocks on top of smaller ones. Move the stack from here to here. You've got to take the blocks off and stack them again, like this. Will turns the puzzle back around. Let's see you try. Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.;
M	WILL (CONT'D)	I'll give you an M&M; if you can get the blocks to the other side - but don't do it the way you did last time. Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME You know what I want. You're just not going to give it to me. Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,
M	WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)	What do you think of Koba?
M	FRANKLIN	You wanna know if I think the 113's making him nuts.
M	WILL	I know he's smart. But there's something else, something worrisome. He challenges me. Taunts me. Will looks toward us, toward the bars.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	I don't want to try it on... .I don't want to start human trials if there's any chance of danger.
M	FRANKLIN	What you're seeing has nothing to do with the 113, Doc. The apes're just like us - they're complex. Some are loyal, some are selfish, some have a good sense of humor. And some are born rotten. Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his
M	FRANKLIN (CONT'D)	This one's a bad apple, that's all. A chill runs down Will's spine. Early day today, Evans?
M	EVANS	Actually I'm not feeling too good.
M	GUARD	You know what: Whiskey, lemon, honey and a cup of hot water. Never fails.
M	EVANS	Thanks - I'm on it. Evans drives off. She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar
M	RODNEY	Still won't eat, won't come out.
M	DODGE	I can fix that. Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Get that monkey ass out of there! At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS. He hands the cookie bag to Rocket. CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered. Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big Caesar watches, satisfied, as the apes feast together. Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.
F	MAURICE	Why cookie Rocket?
M	CAESAR	Need strong. All apes strong.
F	MAURICE	No understand. Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.
M	CAESAR	Gorilla. He breaks another twig.
M	CAESAR (CONT'D)	Orangutan. He breaks another.
M	CAESAR (CONT'D)	Chimpanzee. He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they Apes. He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.
M	WILL	Someone's sleeping late today - Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Dad?
M	RODNEY	Sorry - can't get him to come out. He won't budge.
M	WILL	He knows I'm here?
M	RODNEY	I told him. Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.
M	RODNEY (CONT'D)	Hey - you are not allowed back
M	THERE -	Will ignores him, keeps going. Will runs up to the cage.
M	WILL	Caesar - please! I've got something to tell you - It's about Walter. WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s Will waits. Caesar's not coming out. NASA has temporarily lost communication with the Icarus.
M	NEWSCASTER	Captain Taylor and his crew are navigating the ship around the dark side of Mars. Communication is expected to be reestablished -
M	WILL	I was too late. She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.
M	STEWART	You tried. You worked really hard. Walter knew that.
M	WILL	Wasn't good enough though, was it. ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his
M	FRANKLIN	Just checking in. You didn't show up at work today.
M	FRANKLIN (O.S.)	Hope you're feeling better - let me know if you need anything. REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
F	MAURICE	Where go?
M	CAESAR	Find Mother. As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER. Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
M	UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.	Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that? It's coming from outside. REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed, He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart. Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the Rocket follows. Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the
M	NO CONNECTION.	Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick, Caesar turns away, crestfallen. He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM. They look at each other, lay low. But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight. Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him. CLICK. It locks into place. There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS. Caesar freezes. Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the He hasn't seen Caesar yet.
M	DODGE	Rise and shine, assholes. The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in What the hell - You sly son of a bitch. How'd you do that? Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	We're gonna go slow here, alright? You're gonna go back in your cage, you're not going to give me no trouble. The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent, Cornelia stands, watching. Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Back! Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips. Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	We're going to have you fixed, Einstein, that's for damn sure... But first we're going to figure out how you pulled this off...
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Go on. Get in that cage. Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	I said get! But Caesar doesn't move. Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
M	DODGE (CONT'D)	Get in that cage, you damn dirty ape!
M	CAESAR	No! Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance. Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded, And then... they go nuts.
M	JACOBS (O.S.)	Will? Hello? Will pick up the goddamned phone!
M	WILL	Hello?
M	JACOBS	The animal handler - Franklin - was killed last night. In the primate house.
M	WILL	Franklin's dead?
M	JACOBS	Something very powerful broke his neck. Snapped it in two.
M	WILL	Could it have been one of our chimps?
M	JACOBS	All our apes are accounted for - â¢ secured in their cages. But here's the kicker: One of our security guards swears he chased a chimpanzee off the grounds last night. Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's Where in the hell did that chimp come from?!
M	MR. LANDON	The Ranch. Landon speaking. Hey Stewart. Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast about half an hour ago... He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and Let me call you back... He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the
M	MR. LANDON (CONT'D)	Hey Dodge - Stewart just called - WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...
M	MR. LANDON	She said that - Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE
M	IN THE DISTANCE	Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING. No one's answering. In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.
M	WILL	You go get help.
M	STEWART	Not a way in the world. I'm coming with you.
M	STEWART	Oh my God... I'm calling 911.. Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window. .CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.
M	WILL	Caesar. Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's
M	STEWART	It's going to take them at least half an hour to get here. He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an He has an idea. Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	What are you doing?
M	WILL	I'm going to kill him. Caesar?
M	WILL	He's dangerous.
M	STEWART	You're wrong - he can't have been the one who killed that man -
M	WILL	There is no other explanation. A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart They're surrounded. She SCREAMS. Will barricades the back door with a table.
M	GLASS SHATTERS.	Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door Caesar! I need to talk to you! Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Caesar!
M	DODGE	Welcome to the mad house.
M	STEWART	I called Animal Control - they'll be here soon -
M	WILL	I just want to talk to you!
M	DODGE	Well this'll be interesting because your freak'll talk back.
M	RODNEY	Dodge thinks he spoke to him.
M	DODGE	He did! He said the word "no" - right to my face.
M	WILL	What do you mean?
M	DODGE	He can talk.
M	STEWART	That's impossible.
M	DODGE	Then he must have a voicebox in his ass, because I heard him! Caesar walks up. Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED
M	WILL	Caesar - people are coming. People with guns. You've got to make the apes go back in their cages. Apes no belong in cage. Human put apes in cage. Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent. Never again. Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds
M	WILL	I brought this for you. Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it. Don't you want it? Never. They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but
M	WILL	You went to the lab last night. I know it was you. Caesar doesn't deny it. How could you kill that man, Caesar? Once you kill you can't it back - that man's gone forever. It gives him pause. Caesar no kill.
M	WILL	But... Caesar no kill! Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.
M	WILL	Don't walk away. We need to talk.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Don't - ! Where'd he get that wristband, Caesar? That's Koba's band... Did Koba get out of his cage?? Yelling after Caesar.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	Caesar wait! But Caesar's not waiting. No. At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.
M	CAESAR (CONT'D)	C...Cage! The humans' jaws drop, petrified.
M	VOICE	They could be spread out all over the County by now. Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER
M	WILL	No - they'll stick together. They're following one ape. You kill him, you stop them all.
M	HUFFS	There's a leader? Ask him - he raised him. All eyes to Will.
M	WILL	His name is Caesar. If I can reason with him, I know I can put an end to this.
M	HUFFS	Reason with him? Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad
M	WILL	You don't understand - this chimp is smart - he'll listen to me
M	HUFF	Get on the horn with every agency you can think of! We've got to track down these monkeys before they do major damage! The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge
M	DODGE	You need me riding with you. I've got experience with these animals. I can point out the one you want.
M	OFFICER	If you think of anything else, this is where I can be reached - A RUMBLING SOUND from behind. They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way. The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.
M	OFFICER	We have a situation at Gen-Sys Laboratory! Approximately two dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know what the hell they are - AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,
M	WILL	The lab.
M	HUFFS	You know anything about this?
M	WILL	That's where I work. EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction. A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.
M	OFFICER #1	Here they come!
M	OFFICER #2	There's more of them! Those are my chimps... They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON
M	BROKEN GLASS.	Jacobs freezes. KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at Then Koba calmly walks past him. Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through
M	HOFFS	Any idea where they're headed? Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter
M	WILL	No.
M	HOFFS	They were seen heading north from the lab - let's start with that. KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
M	GIRL	Monkey! OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then
M	WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.	suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure. Mommy? The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't
M	MOTHER	April! Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.
M	HUFFS	You see them?
M	WILL	No, I can't see -
M	STEWART	Oh my god. Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW: She realizes something.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	I know where they're going. FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors. A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos. Released balloons float lazily upward.
M	WILL	He's going to release the apes. Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off - The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.
M	WRANGLER	What the hell am I supposed to do when they get here?! An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers, Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth. Caesar's apes are waiting for them. By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY. Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
M	DODGE	That's him! The one with the white on his shoulder! A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE He climbs into a waiting taxi. He looks like hell.
M	TAXI DRIVER	Where to, my man?
M	JACOBS	24 Marigold.
M	TAXI DRIVER	Want me to turn down the air? Whatever. SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS. SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her Caesar continues on. Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic, And Will realizes the moment he sees it.
M	WILL	They're going to Muir Woods. I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to hurt anyone - he's just trying to get the apes out of the City! Shut down the Golden Gate Bridge!
M	WILL	No - let them through! The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches FLASHBACK of Cornelia, sniffing the cookie. Will yelling Caesar - devastated, the rage building in his face. Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's Maurice takes Cornelia from Caesar's arms as Buck and Rocket Koba hangs back, watching, fascinated, as Maurice lays Is he hurt?
M	WILL	No - not him. Suddenly, OUT OF THE FOG, THE APES APPEAR. PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped. Caesar and his apes race forward. Tell them to hold their fire until they get past the traffic! WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
M	ON THE BRIDGE	Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready. He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE. Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing, The remaining apes follow. Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
M	BELOW THE BRIDGE	Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
M	ABOVE BRIDGE	Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at They keep moving.
M	ON THE BRIDGE	The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
M	OFFICER	They're all around us! Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH - DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG, He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO
M	BAM!	Rocket's hit in the back! He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again. The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD
M	THE BARRICADE.	Like a freight train of menacing power. Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming. Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.
M	BELOW THE BRIDGE	Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.
M	AERIAL VIEW	As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON
M	APES SCAMPERING BELOW.	Vanquishing the humans.
M	DODGE.	Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires again, his face red with the tension of what's to come. Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
M	OFFICER #1	We can't gas the forest! The slightest wind would take it over to Tiburon. Well it'll take us months to find them in there.
M	OFFICER #3	Not to mention rounding them all up. Will approaches the group.
M	WILL	I know where they are. The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
M	HUFFS	This man owns one of the chimps. The so-called "leader". Says he can reason him out.
M	WILL	His name is Caesar. I think he'll listen to me. If he comes out, the other apes will follow. Sounds pretty far-fetched.
M	OFFICER #1	You think you know where to find this monkey? Will starts to correct him - lets it go.
M	WILL	I do. I used to bring him here. The Officers look at each other.
M	OFFICER #1	We don't have a lot of options. Let's give it a try.
M	WILL	But you have to promise me - if I can get them out, you'll take them peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage them. No killing. Beat.
M	HUFFS	Whatever it takes. She's terrified, trying to mask it.
M	WILL	You think this is a bad idea?
M	STEWART	Definitely. He thought so.
M	STEWART (CONT'D)	He's never going to agree to come out with you.
M	WILL	I know. Got to try, right? I owe him that much. Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses, Think he'll forgive me?
M	STEWART	What? Will waves it off - never mind. Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into CRACKLING of BRANCHES. More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar? He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
M	HUFFS	Follow me. Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S
M	STEWART	Hang on a second... Where are they going? Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
M	WILL	Caesar! ... He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his You. Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will. He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
M	CAESAR	Humans coming.
M	WILL	No. I'm alone. Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.
M	WILL (CONT'D)	I owe you an apology.
M	CAESAR	Will want Caesar dead.
M	WILL	I thought you had killed a man. But I should have known better. Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
M	WILL (CONT'D)	I want you to know that all of this is my fault. My responsibility. Can you forgive me? BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path. Wait - no -
M	CAESAR	Will leave.
M	WILL	I won't -
M	CAESAR	Will leave now.
M	WILL	No. I'm staying with you. Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down. Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired, Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar. All is quiet. The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.
M	TAXI DRIVER	Where to, my man? It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT
M	HUNSIKER	SFO. International terminal.
M	TAXI DRIVER	You got it. The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
M	NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)	As the ape search continues, a virulent flu strain has exploded in and around San Francisco, sending shock waves and panic throughout the community.
M	NEWSCASTER VOICE #2	Authorities suspect the origin of the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys Laboratories - the same private company from which several laboratory chimpanzees escaped earlier this week - We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
M	APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.	All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.
M	NEWSCASTER VOICE #3	As the death toll rapidly rises, Hospitals are desperately trying to meet the growing demand... Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us. Although isolated in the western region of the country, the numbers are catastrophic and quickly rising... Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.
M	NEWSCASTER VOICE #5	Efforts to quarantine appear to have failed. The strain has been spotted as far away as Singapore and Australia... Casualties have reached apocalyptic levels. Authorities urge you to stay inside your homes... For those of you who can hear me, I say... God's speed and so long to you all. The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A
