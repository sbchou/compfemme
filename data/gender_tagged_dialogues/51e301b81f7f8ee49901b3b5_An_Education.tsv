M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	MISS STUBBS	Jenny. Again.
F	JENNY	Isn't it because Mr Rochester's blind?
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	I don't want to hear any French singing. French singing wasn't on the syllabus, last time I looked.
F	JENNY	I've got an English essay to do by tomorrow morning.
M	JACK	I don't want to hear anything through the ceiling this afternoon, apart from the sound of sweat dripping onto textbooks.
F	JENNY	Cello?
M	JACK	No cello.
F	JENNY	I thought we agreed that cello was my interest or hobby?
M	JACK	It's already your interest or hobby. When they ask you "What's your interest or hobby?" at your Oxford interview, you can say, "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie. You don't need to practise a hobby. A hobby is a hobby.
F	JENNY	Or interest.
M	JACK	You don't need to be good at it. You just have to be interested in it.
F	JENNY	Can I stop going to the youth orchestra, then?
M	JACK	No. The orchestra shows you're a joiner-inner. Universities like joiner-inners.
F	JENNY	Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined in. So now I can stop.
M	JACK	Well, if you stop, that shows the opposite, doesn't it? That shows you're a rebel. They don't want that at Oxford.
F	JENNY	No. They don't want people who think for themselves.
M	JACK	Course they don't.
M	GRAHAM	Should I wear, you know, Sunday best?
F	JENNY	You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to show my father you're un jeune homme serieux, not a teddy boy.
M	GRAHAM	Oh, God.
F	JENNY	It'll be all right. I won't wait. It's going to bucket down in a minute. I'll see you at the weekend.
M	GRAHAM	Oh, yes. Bye.
M	SMALLER BOY 1	Goodbye, darling! See you at the weekend! I will miss you with all of my heart!
M	DAVID	Hello.
M	DAVID	Listen. If you've got any sense, you wouldn't take a lift from a strange man.
M	DAVID	I am, however, a music lover, and I'm worried about your cello. So what I propose is, you put it in the car and walk alongside me.
F	JENNY	How do I know you won't just drive off with the cello?
M	DAVID	Ah. Good point.
M	DAVID	How much does a new cello cost? Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't know. Let's say thirty.
M	DAVID	There. Security.
M	DAVID	I'm David, by the way.
M	DAVID	And you are...?
F	JENNY	Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a car like this before. C'est tres chic.
M	DAVID	It's a Bristol. Not many of `em made.
M	DAVID	How did the concert go?
F	JENNY	It was a rehearsal. The concert's next Thursday.
M	DAVID	What are you playing?
F	JENNY	Elgar.
M	DAVID	Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a shame he spent so much time in Worcester, don't you? Worcester's too near Birmingham. And you can hear that in the music. There's a horrible Brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough.
M	DAVID	Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and Jews mix very well.
F	JENNY	I'm not a Jew!
M	DAVID	No. I am. I wasn't...accusing you.
F	JENNY	Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I sit in the car with my cello?
M	DAVID	Jump in.
F	JENNY	It's even nicer on the inside.
M	DAVID	Where to, madam?
F	JENNY	I only live round the corner.
M	DAVID	What a shame. We'll just make it last as long as we can.
M	DAVID	Smoke?
F	JENNY	I'd better not. I'm a bit close to home.
M	DAVID	I suppose cellists must go to a lot of concerts.
F	JENNY	We don't go to any concerts. We don't believe in them.
M	DAVID	Oh, they're real.
F	JENNY	So people say.
M	DAVID	Why don't we believe in them?
F	JENNY	I suppose...What would he say?
M	DAVID	Your father, this is?
F	JENNY	Oh, yes. He'd say there's no point to them. They're just for fun. Apart from school concerts, of course, which are no fun at all, so we go to those. The proper ones don't help you get on.
M	DAVID	Which of course is what is so wonderful about them. Anyway, you'll go one day.
F	JENNY	Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it seems as though that's what all this slog is for. If I get to University, I'm going to read what I want and think about what I want and listen to what I want. And I'm going to look at paintings and go to French films and talk to people who know lots about lots.
M	DAVID	Good for you. Which University?
F	JENNY	Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go anywhere?
M	DAVID	I studied at what I believe they call the University of Life. And I didn't get a very good degree there.
F	JENNY	This is me. Thank you.
F	MARJORIE	How's your mother, Graham?
M	GRAHAM	She's fine, thanks. She sends her best, by the way.
M	JACK	Where are you applying, Graham?
M	GRAHAM	I'm not sure yet.
M	JACK	Well, when will you be sure? You can't let the grass grow under your feet, you know. Otherwise you'll be at the back of the queue.
F	JENNY	I suppose so. I suppose the growing grass would knock you off balance, and then you'd fall over, and by the time you picked yourself up, there'd be a queue.
M	GRAHAM	I might take a year off.
M	JACK	What for?
M	GRAHAM	I don't know. Maybe do some travelling, that sort of thing.
M	JACK	Travelling? What are you, a teddy boy?
M	JACK	You know she's going to Oxford, don't you? Oxford. English. If we can get her Latin up to scratch.
M	JACK	So she's studying English at Oxford while you're a wandering Jew...
M	GRAHAM	Mr Mellor...I'm not a teddy boy. I'm an homme serieux. Jeune. An homme jeune serieux homme.
F	JENNY	Oh!
F	JENNY	They're for me!
F	MARJORIE	Who are they from?
F	JENNY	Gosh. Him.
F	MARJORIE	Who's `him'?
F	JENNY	Just...A chap I met.
F	MARJORIE	A chap who sends flowers? So he's a man-chap?
F	JENNY	Yes, he is, really.
M	JACK	What's going on here?
F	MARJORIE	Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap.
M	JACK	A chap? What kind of chap? Who? Why?
F	JENNY	He's wishing me luck for tonight.
M	JACK	Are you sure that's all he's wishing? And where does he get the money from?
F	JENNY	He earns it, I expect.
M	JACK	What do you mean, he earns it? Why isn't he at school? What does he do?
F	JENNY	Can we just go? Otherwise the bunch of good-luck flowers will actually be responsible for me actually missing the concert. Which would be ironic, n'est ce pas?
M	JACK	Well I don't like it.
F	MARJORIE	Objection noted. Jenny?
F	JENNY	Noted.
M	JACK	Ten bob's worth of luck, I reckon. That's a lot for a schoolgirl. You can't leave them out here, anyway. I'd burgle a house that had flowers outside. They'll think we're made of money.
F	JENNY	The whole point about him is that he doesn't feel.
F	TINA	We still don't have to like him.
F	JENNY	Camus doesn't want you to like him. What he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. Being engagee is bourgeois. His mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. He kills this Arab and he doesn't feel anything.
F	TINA	I wouldn't feel anything if my mother died. Does that make me an existentialist?
F	JENNY	No. That just makes you a cow.
F	HATTIE	Une vache.
F	JENNY	Well I'm going to be French. I'm going to Paris and I'm going to smoke and listen to Jacques Brel and wear black. And I won't speak. Ever. C'est plus chic, comme...
M	DAVID	Hello.
F	JENNY	Hello. Thank you.
M	DAVID	How did it go?
F	JENNY	Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I didn't mess my bit up, anyway. And no-one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards.
M	DAVID	Always the mark of a cultural triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran into you. What are you doing on Friday?
F	JENNY	Going to school.
M	DAVID	I meant the evening.
F	JENNY	Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.
M	DAVID	Because I'm going to listen to some Schubert in St John's, Smith Square. My friends Danny and Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound?
F	JENNY	Thank you. And I'd like you to take me. I'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap.
M	DAVID	I usually watch Danny. He knows that sort of thing.
M	DAVID	Seven? And we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...But if you, if that's not...Well, we can always put you in a taxi.
F	JENNY	Supper.
M	DAVID	If you want.
F	JENNY	The trouble is, we'll already have eaten.
M	DAVID	Well. I mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on Friday you could...not eat?
F	JENNY	Oh. Yes. Of course.
F	TINA	I'm sorry. I just had the strangest dream. I dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car I've ever seen. And then you came back and you didn't mention it.
F	TINA	`Oo wazzee?
F	JENNY	Just a man who's been trying to pick me up. We're going to a concert on Friday night. And then we're having a spot of supper.
F	TINA	A spot of supper?
F	JENNY	You've heard of supper?
F	HATTIE	We've heard of it. But we've never eaten it.
F	JENNY	Neither of you is interested in the concert part, I notice.
F	HATTIE	No. Of course not.
F	TINA	Oh my God! I've only just realised! That's what's going to happen to you, isn't it? Look at her! Men are going to pick her up in the street and take her out to supper!
F	HATTIE	God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't thought of that. Look at her.
F	JENNY	Don't be so daft.
F	TINA	We're trying to attract the attention of boys. Anyway. You're going to have to tell us more than that.
F	JENNY	Why?
F	HATTIE	Because no man's ever going to ask us out to supper. Not until we're ladies, anyway. You're going to have to tell us everything. Otherwise it's not fair.
F	JENNY	There won't be anything to tell.
F	TINA	Well, make something up, then.
M	JACK	I won't allow it!
F	JENNY	Fine. He's quite happy for you to take me.
M	JACK	Right. I will.
F	JENNY	Good.
M	JACK	Where is it?
F	JENNY	St John's Smith Square.
M	JACK	Where's that?
F	JENNY	I don't know. I'm sure we could find out. It's in Westminster. Just around the corner from the Abbey.
M	JACK	How d'you know that?
F	MARJORIE	I had a life before we were married, you know.
F	JENNY	He soon put a stop to that.
M	JACK	There we are.
F	JENNY	Where are we?
M	JACK	Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not going all the way over there.
F	JENNY	The trouble is, that's where St John's Smith Square is.
M	JACK	And I've just said. That's where I'm not going. There must be something on locally. Where's the paper?
F	MARJORIE	Jack, she wants to see someone who can play. She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland scratching away. I'll take her.
M	JACK	And how are you going to get over there? RAF helicopter?
F	JENNY	That's him. Now what?
M	JACK	Oh, bloody hell.
F	MARJORIE	Jack!
F	JENNY	Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.
M	JACK	What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews!
M	DAVID	I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David Goldman.
M	JACK	I didn't mean I'm not against you... Actually, I did mean that, because I'm not, but...
F	JENNY	Dad!
M	JACK	I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person I'd be against, if I were the sort of person who was against...people. You're not an old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and this is Marjorie.
M	DAVID	You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny.
M	DAVID	You're a lucky man, Jack.
M	JACK	I suppose I am, yes.
M	DAVID	So. Gosh. (He looks around approvingly.) This is lovely.
F	MARJORIE	Thank you.
M	JACK	I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a drink?
M	DAVID	I'd love one, Jack, but we're running a little late. If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll shoot off.
F	JENNY	Ah. Well. Dad's got something to tell you.
M	JACK	No, no, nothing...It was more of a question, really. How would you get to St John's Smith Square from here? For future reference?
M	DAVID	Oh, it's a pretty straight run, really. Up to Hammersmith, take the A4 through Kensington and you're there.
M	JACK	Simple as that.
M	DAVID	Simple as that.
F	MARJORIE	So shall I book some tickets for something?
M	JACK	No.
M	JACK	Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then.
M	DAVID	I was hoping Jenny would come with me afterwards to have a bite of supper with my aunt Helen.
M	JACK	Oh, well, I suppose...
M	DAVID	How about if I promise to have her in by eleven thirty?
M	JACK	Well, it's Friday night. And if you're going out to the West End...
M	DAVID	Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. See you again.
F	MARJORIE	Have a nice time.
F	JENNY	Bye.
M	JACK	What's that smell? Has he got perfume on?
F	MARJORIE	It's called after-shave, Jack. And it makes a change from carbolic soap.
M	JACK	At least there's no confusion, if you smell of carbolic soap.
F	MARJORIE	Nobody's ever going to get confused about you, dear.
M	DAVID	Hello hello. Are we late?
F	HELEN	I was hoping we'd miss the beginning, and then it wouldn't be worth going in, and we could go off dancing or something.
M	DANNY	Helen is one of the more reluctant members of tonight's audience.
M	DAVID	Jenny, these are my friends Helen and Danny.
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	Shall we?
F	HELEN	Look. We can leave our coats over there. I want to get rid of this.
F	JENNY	I'm so sorry.
F	HELEN	That's OK. It's nice, isn't it?
F	JENNY	It's beautiful. Where did it come from?
F	HELEN	Oh, South Ken somewhere.
F	HELEN	This is...Well, it's good for this sort of concert, isn't it?
F	JENNY	Thank you.
F	HELEN	We should go shopping together one day, if you want.
F	JENNY	That would be nice. But South Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.
F	HELEN	Sorry?
F	JENNY	I just said....It was too expensive for me.
F	HELEN	No you didn't. You said something completely different.
F	JENNY	I just...Well, I said it in French.
F	HELEN	In French? Why?
F	JENNY	I don't know.
F	HELEN	Anyway. It's too expensive for me, too. We don't have to worry about that. If you want something in South Ken, get David to take you shopping.
F	JENNY	Why on earth would he want to take me shopping?
M	DAVID	I booked a table at Juliette's. Will that kill the mood, do you think?
F	HELEN	Oh, I do hope so.
F	HELEN	I always think I'm going to my own funeral when I listen to classical music. (Tentatively) That was classical, wasn't it?
M	DANNY	Yes. Very classical. As classical as you can get.
M	DAVID	Juliette's it is, then. Heaven forbid that we should end the evening reflecting on our own mortality.
M	DAVID	Have you never heard "Chante Francoise Sagan"?
M	DANNY	Oh, it's wonderful.
F	JENNY	I've only got....Well, I think it's just called `Juliette Greco'. The one with the eyes on the sleeve. I saved up and got my French conversation teacher to bring it back after Christmas.
F	HELEN	You've got a French conversation teacher?
F	JENNY	Yes.
F	HELEN	Is that why you suddenly speak French for no reason?
M	DANNY	You must have seen her sing?
M	DAVID	She's marvellous.
M	DANNY	But you should see her in Paris, not here. David will take you.
M	DAVID	I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
F	HELEN	Better than here, really. It's wonderful to find a young person who wants to know things. There's so much I want you to see.
M	DAVID	Are you still all right to come and have a look at that Pembroke Villas place with me on Friday, Danny?
M	DANNY	Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a Burne-Jones coming up at Christie's on Friday. And I want it.
F	JENNY	You're thinking of buying a Burne- Jones? A real one?
M	DANNY	I just have a feeling that the pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.
F	JENNY	I love the pre-Raphaelites.
M	DAVID	Do you?
F	JENNY	Yes, of course. Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman Hunt, so much. He's so garish.
M	DAVID	Absolutely! Why don't we all go to the auction? Wouldn't that be fun?
F	JENNY	An auction. Gosh. How exciting.
M	DANNY	Next Friday morning. David will pick you up.
F	JENNY	Oh. Friday.
M	DANNY	You're busy?
F	JENNY	Well. Yes.
M	DANNY	Tant pis.
M	DAVID	Are you sure you're busy?
F	JENNY	No. I'm sure I could....re- arrange. That would be lovely.
F	MARJORIE	Oh, hello, love. Did you have a nice time?
F	JENNY	What are you doing?
F	MARJORIE	I can't get this casserole dish clean. We had hot-pot tonight, and it's all burnt round...
F	JENNY	It's twenty-five to twelve. We finish tea at seven.
F	MARJORIE	I know what the time is. How was your evening?
F	JENNY	It was...It was the best night of my life.
F	MARJORIE	And he took you home in his car? Right to the door?
F	JENNY	Goodnight, Mum.
F	MARJORIE	And I'm glad you enjoyed the concert.
F	TINA	I'm not interested in Schubert. I want to know what else was on the programme.
F	JENNY	There was nothing like that. He was the perfect gentleman. He just said he wanted to take me places and show me things.
F	TINA	Things plural? Oh my Gawd!
F	MISS STUBBS	I knew that in the end `Jane Eyre' would work its magic upon you. I'm presuming that's what you're so animated about.
F	JENNY	Of course.
F	TINA	`Jane Eyre' and Jenny's new boyfriend.
F	JENNY	He's not my "new boyfriend". God.
F	TINA	It's true. He's more a man- friend, isn't he? He's got a sports-car, Miss Stubbs.
F	MISS STUBBS	Ah. A Mr Rochester figure.
F	TINA	I think he must be as blind as Mr Rochester.
F	MISS STUBBS	Is there no end to your thirst for literary understanding, Jenny? As you may have noticed, I'm attempting to turn the subject away from Jenny's lurid love-life and towards the matter in hand.
F	MISS STUBBS	And it's quite clear on this evidence that most of you know much too much about the former, and almost nothing about the latter. Reluctantly I must concede that Jenny is evidently an expert on both matters. Excellent as always, Jenny.
F	JENNY	How do you know Danny?
M	DAVID	Oh, you know. We kept bumping into each other, and we became pals, and we've ended up doing a bit of work together, when it suits us.
F	JENNY	What kind of work?
M	DAVID	Property. A bit of art dealing. Some buying and selling. This and that...
M	DAVID	I'll be two seconds.
M	DAVID	I'm sorry about that.
F	JENNY	How do you know those, those ...Negro people?
M	DAVID	They're clients.
F	JENNY	Clients?
M	DAVID	Jenny darling, even schwarzers have to live somewhere. And it's not as if they can rent off their own kind, is it?
F	JENNY	I'm not sure I quite understand what you do. boring. All you need to know is that I work in property so that I can take you to nice places.
M	DANNY	You nearly missed it.
M	AUCTIONEER	We turn to lot 41, The Tree of Forgiveness, by Sir Edward Burne- Jones. This is a rare opportunity to purchase a key work of the Pre- Raphaelite movement. Who will start me off at five hundred guineas?
M	AUCTIONEER	Two hundred?
M	AUCTIONEER	Thank you, madam. Three hundred?
M	AUCTIONEER	Do I hear three-fifty?
M	AUCTIONEER	Over to you sir. Four hundred guineas? Thank you. Four hundred and fifty...
M	DAVID	Your turn.
M	AUCTIONEER	No further bids?
M	DAVID	Quick!
M	AUCTIONEER	Five hundred guineas from the very eager new bidder.
M	AUCTIONEER	Five hundred and fifty, madam? Thank you.
M	AUCTIONEER	Six hundred guineas.
M	AUCTIONEER	Six-fifty? Thank you, madam. Seven hundred...
M	AUCTIONEER	Seven hundred?
M	AUCTIONEER	Sold for six hundred and fifty guineas. Thank you.
M	AUCTIONEER	Your name, please?
M	DANNY	You know who you are.
F	JENNY	Jenny Mellor. I know who you are, too. Tell him.
F	JENNY	Jenny Mellor.
M	DANNY	Thank you. Couldn't have bought it without you.
M	DAVID	Well done. A nerveless performance.
M	DANNY	A couple of years ago you could pick these up for fifty quid, you know. Nobody was interested.
F	JENNY	Really? Fifty pounds? I don't believe you.
F	JENNY	That's not a Lockey-Hill!
M	DANNY	There aren't many people who come in here and say that.
F	HELEN	Certainly not me.
F	JENNY	It's beautiful. Do you play?
M	DANNY	I used to. I vowed to myself that one day I'd own one of these. And now I own one and never touch it. It's vulgar to put it on show, really.
F	HELEN	Give it to Jenny.
M	DANNY	That would be even more vulgar.
M	DAVID	Play for us, Jenny.
F	JENNY	Gosh, no. One day. When I'm good enough for it.
M	DAVID	She's good enough now.
F	JENNY	Oh, David. You've never heard me.
M	DAVID	I shall come to hear you in St John's Smith Square. Or in Oxford, when you get there.
M	DANNY	We should all go and spend a weekend in Oxford. Straw boaters, punting, cream teas, antiquarian bookshops. Bit of business, if we can find it. What about next weekend?
M	DAVID/HELEN	Yes!
F	JENNY	A weekend away? I wouldn't be allowed to do that.
M	DAVID	I'll find a way. I'll talk to them.
F	JENNY	Who?
M	DAVID	Jack and Marjorie.
F	JENNY	About what?
M	DAVID	Oxford.
F	JENNY	You're going to ask my father if I can go away with you for the weekend? He'd have you arrested.
M	DAVID	We'll see.
F	JENNY	I'll bet you you can't do it.
M	DAVID	How much?
M	DANNY	Be careful, Jenny. You don't know who you're dealing with.
F	JENNY	Half-a-crown.
M	DAVID	You're on.
F	JENNY	Mon dieu! You must take me back to school. And I've got to change back into my uniform.
F	HELEN	Oh, behave yourselves.
M	MRS WILSON	Test results for the Virgil translation. We will start from the bottom...Patricia.
M	MRS WILSON (CONT'D)	Absent. Margaret. 48%. Jenny...
M	MRS WILSON (CONT'D)	52%. That would just about scrape a pass in the exam proper. Not good enough for Oxford candidates.
F	MARJORIE	I'll talk to him.
M	JACK	It's her Latin, isn't it?
F	MARJORIE	The test didn't...Well, it didn't go as well as we'd hoped.
M	JACK	you still say I shouldn't go there and have it out with The Latin teacher? this is hopeless.
F	JENNY	are you going to "have it with her? What are you going do? Shout at her until she I'm much cleverer than thinks?
F	MARJORIE	doing their best,
M	JACK	if their best isn't good though, eh? What do we do
F	JENNY	don't go to Oxford. Any of us. even you, Dad.
M	JACK	it's all a waste of time money anyway.
F	MARJORIE	don't mean that.
M	JACK	what's she going to do with English degree? And if she's to spend three years that bloody cello and in French to beatniks, I'm throwing good money bad. I suppose she might a nice lawyer. But she could that at a dinner dance
F	JENNY	yes. That's the whole point an Oxford education. It's the alternative to a dinner
F	MARJORIE	about private tuition?
M	JACK	anyone listening to me? How is that going to cost me?
F	MARJORIE	Five shillings an hour. Maybe a little more for A-level.
M	JACK	Five bob! But... we could spend five bob on this and five bob on that, and before we know it that's our savings down the drain.
F	MARJORIE	And what else are we spending five bob on? What else are we spending sixpence on?
M	JACK	Oh, nothing. (He gestures round the room.) It's all free. That vase was free.
F	MARJORIE	It was, actually. It was a present from Auntie Vi.
M	JACK	That chair was free. The sofa. We don't have to pay for anything. And even if we did, we don't have to work for it. That's the beauty of life, Jenny. Everything's free. Grows on trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He warms to his theme, and grows We've got a lovely Oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's Oxford taken care of. And a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. I'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. I'll go and have a look.
F	MARJORIE	Jack...
M	JACK	No, no, won't take me a minute. I think I saw some at the back there, right next to the pocket money tree. I'll just nip out and check, see that they're doing all right. the wall and scrumping, do we? And you never know. Maybe there'll be a man with deep pockets growing out there. Because God knows we need to find you one.
F	TINA	You could always go to secretarial college with Hattie.
F	JENNY	Oh, thanks.
F	HATTIE	Charming!
F	JENNY	Oh, no.
M	GRAHAM	Hello.
F	JENNY	Oh. Graham. Hello.
M	GRAHAM	I haven't seen you for ages....It all went wrong, didn't it? The tea-party, I mean. Was it because of the year off?
F	JENNY	No, no. It's just...I've got so much to do if I'm going to get the grades I need.
F	TINA	Yes. She's got no time for boys.
F	JENNY	Bye, Graham.
F	JENNY	Hello.
M	JACK	Oh. Hello. David does the most brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny. Actually, he can do all the Goons.
M	DAVID	I don't think I'm very good at Eccles.
M	JACK	Oh, no, you've got him...
F	JENNY	But what's he doing here?
M	DAVID	I wasn't going to disturb you. I knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone.
F	JENNY	You came to see Mum and Dad?
M	JACK	Is that so hard to imagine?
F	JENNY	And you're drinking? But it's not Christmas!
M	JACK	Hark at her! Makes us sound as though we've signed the pledge. You don't know everything about us, you know. We had a life before you came along.
F	JENNY	Yes, that's true. I'm only going on what I've seen over the last sixteen years.
F	MARJORIE	I'm trying to think what you missed. Nothing much comes to mind.
M	JACK	They can't stand to see me enjoying myself.
F	JENNY	Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've got a huge pile of Latin translation to do.
M	JACK	You didn't tell me David went to Oxford.
F	JENNY	No. I didn't.
M	DAVID	all the good it did me.
M	JACK	did you read?
M	DAVID	English. Just like every semi-employed layabout in
M	JACK	Which college?
M	DAVID	
F	MARJORIE	that funny?
F	JENNY	
M	DAVID	was just telling Jack that I'm back next weekend. I go and my old professor every now again. what you need, Jenny. on the inside track. It's always what you know, is it,
M	DAVID	true. And Clive would love Have you ever come across Lewis?
F	JENNY	has never come across anyone.
M	DAVID	just thought he might know some the books.
F	JENNY	has never read any books.
M	JACK	he written?
M	DAVID	He wrote a children's book called `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' that did very well, I believe.
F	MARJORIE	CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're talking about?
M	DAVID	Well, to us he was just the old codger who taught Medieval literature. But I came to know him very well. We just...got along, do you know what I mean?
F	MARJORIE	Jenny used to love those books.
M	DAVID	Gosh. That dates me. He was writing them when I was there.
F	JENNY	I'd love to meet him. he is the one being asked.
M	DAVID	I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the uptake. Would Jenny like to come with me at the weekend?
M	JACK	Well, I don't know about this weekend. But one day, yes, thank you.
F	JENNY	How often do you see him?
M	DAVID	Oh, once every couple of years. But next time, eh?
F	JENNY	Hopefully I'll be there by then. So that won't be much use.
M	JACK	Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night?
M	DAVID	Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners.
M	DAVID	Clive will get her a room in college. That's easy enough.
F	MARJORIE	Sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up.
F	JENNY	Please, Daddy. It would be so helpful to know something about the place.
M	JACK	Would it be a bother to you, David?
M	DAVID	I'd be delighted.
F	JENNY	That was scandalous.
M	DAVID	I told you. You owe me half-a- crown.
M	DAVID	Come on!
F	HELEN	Nearly ready!
M	DAVID	How can they only be nearly ready?
M	DANNY	I wouldn't be surprised if three of them come out, you know. That's the only explanation. They're making themselves a friend. LADIES! Let's go. Please.
F	HELEN	There. You'll do. You can keep it. I can only wear so many every day.
F	JENNY	Really? Thank you.
F	HELEN	What about tonight? Will you be needing a nightie? Or not?
F	JENNY	A nightie?
F	JENNY	Will we be sharing bedrooms?
F	HELEN	You're not sleeping with him?
F	JENNY	No. I'm...No.
F	HELEN	Good for you.
F	JENNY	Really? Do you think so?
F	HELEN	You're only sixteen. And you don't want to get into the family way, do you?
F	JENNY	Oh, I'd make sure that didn't happen. I'm going to do it when I'm seventeen. On my seventeenth birthday, hopefully.
F	HELEN	With David?
F	JENNY	Well...Golly. I suppose it will be with David, won't it?
F	HELEN	When's your birthday?
F	JENNY	April.
F	HELEN	Oh, he'll be around in April. If that's what you want. Anyway. I'll find you a nightie.
M	DANNY	Shall, we, ah... Make a move?
M	DANNY	Imagine spending three years here.
F	HELEN	I know.
F	JENNY	Can we stop?
M	DAVID	Maybe later. There are a couple of things we have to do.
F	HELEN	Oh, it's always like this. There are millions of places I've never seen because I've been stuck in here.
F	JENNY	You never get out? There's never anywhere to go in the places they stop.
M	DAVID	So. Now.Is he Clive, do you think? Or CS?
F	HELEN	I'm confused now. I thought you'd made him up?
M	DANNY	No, we...Never mind.
M	DAVID	There.
F	JENNY	"To dear Jenny. With the pleasure of meeting you. Come and see me again soon. Clive."
F	HELEN	Dirty old man.
F	HELEN	Why are university girls so strange-looking?
F	HELEN	It's true. And they can't all have started off that way, can they? Most girls aren't ugly, but most girl students are. So there must be something about those places that, you know, makes you fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.
M	DAVID	Well, if you look at it that way...I mean, that's proper scientific analysis. And you can't argue with science.
F	HELEN	I'm still not quite clear on what you want to do when you get here.
F	JENNY	I want to read English.
F	HELEN	Books?
F	JENNY	Sorry?
F	HELEN	You want to read English books?
F	JENNY	Oh. Yes. Reading English is just another way of saying...
M	DANNY	I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're wasting your breath.
M	DAVID	Anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get more of a feel for the place.
M	DANNY	Absolutely. This would be a good place to do a little business.
M	DANNY	All those little old ladies wandering around...I'll bet this place is rife with stats.
F	JENNY	Please explain what stats are. You're always going on about them.
M	DAVID	All right. Think of a number. Now think about the most boring lesson you've ever had at school. multiply it by the number you first thought of, and there you are. That's the official boredom content of stats.
F	JENNY	We've got exactly the same curtains at home.
M	DAVID	Let's not talk about curtains. You look beautiful. You really are a princess.
F	JENNY	There's something you should know, David. I'm...Well, I'm a virgin. And I want to stay that way until I'm seventeen.
M	DAVID	I think that's good. I think that's right. And for your seventeenth birthday I'm going to take you to Paris or Rome or Florence and make you feel like the most beautiful princess in the kingdom of love. But we can still be romantic, can't we?
F	JENNY	Well, yes. Of course we can. If it doesn't mean...
M	DAVID	Minnie....
F	JENNY	Is that me?
M	DAVID	Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse, and I'm your bubbalub.
F	JENNY	Oh. If that's what..
M	DAVID	Minnie.
F	JENNY	Yes, David?
M	DAVID	Bubbalub...
F	JENNY	Sorry. Yes, bubbalub?
M	DAVID	Would you mind if I had a look at what might one day be mine? Just a peek?
F	JENNY	You just want to see them?
M	DAVID	I just want to see them.
M	DAVID	Let it fall from your shoulders.
M	DAVID	Thank you.
M	DAVID	Might be worth a look.
F	HELEN	Jenny...
F	JENNY	Aren't you coming?
F	HELEN	We don't go in.
F	JENNY	What are you talking about?
M	DANNY	Helen will look after you. Go and find a nice cup of tea somewhere.
F	JENNY	I don't need looking after, thank you very much. David, I want to see...
M	DANNY	I'm not going to tell you a second time. Now. Run along.
F	HELEN	They won't be long. Either way.
F	JENNY	"Either way"?
F	HELEN	Sometimes they find something, sometimes they don't.
F	HELEN	And when they do find something, we usually have to leave quite quickly. They can be a bit naughty, sometimes. Anyway. It's nice to have company. I'm usually outside on my own.
F	HELEN	Coo-ee. Jenny.
M	DANNY	Sorry about being a little brisk back there, Jenny. We have our way of doing things. Silly, really.
M	DAVID	Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not spoil things.
F	JENNY	Me? I'm spoiling things?
M	DAVID	I think there must be some kind of misunderstanding.
M	DANNY	Who wants to come up for a drink?
M	DAVID	Jenny?
F	JENNY	No thanks. You go. I'll find my own way home.
M	DAVID	Jenny!
M	DAVID	It was an old map. A Speed. It was cooped up in that miserable little cottage, and she didn't even know what it was. What a waste! It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we are. It should be with us. We know how to look after it properly. We liberated it.
F	JENNY	Liberated! That's one word for it.
M	DAVID	Oh, don't be bourgeois, Jenny. You're better than that. I know you have fun with us. I can see it. You drink everything I put in front of you down in one, every last drop, and then you slam your glass down on the bar and ask for more, and it's wonderful. We're not clever like you, so we have to be clever in other ways, because if we weren't, there would be no fun.
M	We have to be clever with maps,	and..and.. You want to know what stats are? Stats are old ladies who are scared of coloured people. So I move the coloureds in and the old ladies move out and I buy their flats cheap. That's what I do. So now you know.
M	DAVID	And if you don't like it, then I will understand, and you can go back to Twickenham and listen to the Home Service and do your Latin homework. But these weekends, and the restaurants and the concerts..They don't grow on trees.
M	DAVID	Do you understand? Of course you do. This is who we are, Jenny.
M	DAVID	I suppose you have homework to do.
F	JENNY	Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank you. I had a nice time.
M	DAVID	Really? In spite of the, the incident? With the map?
F	JENNY	As you said in the car, it was a misunderstanding.
M	DAVID	Exactly. A muddle.
F	JENNY	You have no idea how boring everything was before I met you.
M	DAVID	I hope that there's something more than excitement to our relationship.
F	JENNY	Excitement's a lot, when you're at school and you live in Twickenham.
M	DAVID	You know what I'm trying to say. I want you to like me for who I am, not just what I can do for you.
F	JENNY	But that is who you are. I've never met anyone like you. Action is character, our English teacher says.
M	DAVID	What does that mean?
F	JENNY	I think it means that if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. And I never did anything before I met you. And sometimes I think no-one's ever done anything in this stupid country, apart from you.
M	DAVID	That's a good place to end the weekend. I'll give you a tinkle.
F	JENNY	Thank you.
M	JACK	Here she is! The wanderer returns!
F	MARJORIE	Did you have a nice time?
F	JENNY	Lovely, thank you.
M	JACK	Was he nice to you?
F	JENNY	Look inside.
M	JACK	Well I never. Look at this, Marjorie.
F	MARJORIE	"Clive"...Lucky girl. What was he like?
F	JENNY	He was just...normal. Kind.
F	MARJORIE	And did he show you round?
F	JENNY	Oh, he was busy. David did, though.
F	MARJORIE	What did you think?
F	JENNY	Beautiful. Did it make you want to work harder?
M	JACK	Never a dull moment with David, is there? If it's not concerts, it's famous authors. Bit different from that lad you brought home for tea, isn't he?
F	MARJORIE	David's a lot older than Graham.
M	JACK	Graham could live to be two hundred, and he still wouldn't be swanning around with famous authors. Hasn't got it in him.
F	JENNY	He might become a famous author, for all you know.
M	JACK	Being one isn't the same as knowing one, is it? Anyone can be one. But if you move in those circles...
F	JENNY	What?
M	JACK	Well, it says something about you, doesn't it? It says you're going places. It says you're well connected. He's an impressive young man, that David. I like him more and more.
F	MARJORIE	Well, they say opposites attract, don't they? I wouldn't have thought he was your sort.
M	JACK	He wasn't. And now he is.
F	MARJORIE	Is that how you feel, Jenny?
F	JENNY	I feel....I Feel I should do my homework.
M	GYM TEACHER	Ladies, please. Christmas is coming.
F	HATTIE	What the hell are those?
F	JENNY	Russian Sobranies.
F	HATTIE	Where did they come from?
F	TINA	She might have bought them from the Savoy, or Claridges, or the opera, or some fancy nightclub. Who knows, with Jenny?
F	JENNY	Paris. You can't buy them here.
F	TINA	You never bought them yourself?
F	JENNY	No. I never.
F	TINA	Shut up, you stuck-up cow.
F	JENNY	But I'll bring you some back, if you want.
F	TINA	You're joking.
F	JENNY	Non.
F	HATTIE	He's taking you to Paris?
F	JENNY	Oui.
F	HATTIE	This term?
F	JENNY	Peut-etre.
F	TINA	Isn't it your birthday next Tuesday?
F	JENNY	Might be.
F	HATTIE	Oh, my God! Your birthday!
F	TINA	I wouldn't like to be you. All those dinners you've had off him. Ouch.
F	JENNY	You have such a Victorian attitude to sex, you two.
F	TINA	Oh, sorry, Dr Kinsey. We're not all as experienced as you. I mean, you've done it...(She counts on her fingers) I make it never! Can that be right?
F	HATTIE	But your parents are just going to let you swan off like that?
F	JENNY	They don't know yet. David's got a plan, he says. He usually has something up his sleeve.
F	TINA	I've noticed that. What did he tell them when you had your weekend in Oxford?
F	JENNY	Oh, it was....(She changes her mind) David went to Oxford. Merton. English. And he offered to show me round.
F	HATTIE	So you have a good-looking boyfriend with pots of money, brains and a nice car.
F	JENNY	Apparently I do.
F	TINA	And they tell us there's a God.
F	JENNY	Sod. Miss Davies.
M	JACK	Is David taking you somewhere special tonight?
F	JENNY	Not that I know of.
F	MARJORIE	I've asked Graham round for tea and birthday cake.
F	JENNY	Graham?
M	JACK	What do we want him round for?
F	MARJORIE	I happened to be talking to his mother about something, and...
F	JENNY	What did you happen to be talking to her about?
F	MARJORIE	I thought it would be nice.
F	JENNY	What if David turns up?
F	MARJORIE	Are we expecting David to turn up?
M	JACK	It might not be a bad thing if he did.
F	MARJORIE	Really?
M	JACK	Well, if you think about it, there's more than one way of skinning a cat.
F	JENNY	And who's the skinned cat, in this enchanting image? Me?
M	JACK	No, of course...
F	JENNY	I have an education to pursue.
M	JACK	Blow them out, then, before the whole place burns down.
F	MARJORIE	Who'd like a piece?
M	GRAHAM	Never mind. I'll have one of those.
M	JACK	Come on. Presents.
F	JENNY	Oh. Thank you. I needed a new one.
M	GRAHAM	Oh dear.
M	JACK (O.S.)	Good grief. You won't believe this, Jenny. Did you leave anything in the shop?
M	DAVID	It's a special day.
M	JACK	She's a special girl.
M	DAVID	Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello, young man.
F	JENNY	This is Graham.
M	DAVID	Graham, a pleasure. I'm David.
M	JACK	Makes your dictionary look a bit feeble, eh Graham?
F	MARJORIE	And ours too, come to that.
M	JACK	Well, we're not the ones trying to impress her.
F	JENNY	Clearly.
M	JACK	David, what can I get you to drink?
M	DAVID	What's everybody else having? What have you got there, Graham?
M	JACK	I've given him a glass of pop.
M	GRAHAM	I'd better be going I have a stack of homework to do.
M	DAVID	Yes. Well. You can put the pop away now. What is there for the grown-ups?
M	JACK	A glass of something warming?
M	DAVID	You know me so well.
F	JENNY	Can I open anything yet?
F	MARJORIE	Wait for me.
M	DAVID	Before you start on that little lot , I have a surprise. Next weekend, we're all going to Chez Georges to celebrate Jenny's birthday.
M	JACK	Lovely.
M	DAVID	Chez Georges is in the Boulevard St Germain. In Paris.
M	JACK	How d'you mean, Paris?
F	JENNY	You know the one, Dad.
M	JACK	But..We haven't got any French money. And I'm not sure...I just don't think it would agree with me.
F	JENNY	Dad!
M	JACK	They don't like us, the French, you know. John Sutton at work went once. They were very rude to him. I'm not sure I'd like that. understands David's ploy perfectly, and the role she
M	JACK	I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but...It's not for me, Europe. We'll go another time.
F	JENNY	You've just said you don't like Europe. What's going to change? It'll have to be Europe, won't it? Because it isn't going to be you.
F	MARJORIE	I can take her.
M	JACK	To France? And leave me here on my own?
F	JENNY	Oh, for God's sake.
M	DAVID	Listen, I'm really sorry to have caused all this to-do. I just thought it might be nice. But I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle Daniel. They can have your tickets.
M	JACK	Aunt Helen? The one who went to the concert with you?
M	DAVID	Yes, that's the one.
M	JACK	Well, there we are.
M	DAVID	Where are we?
M	JACK	Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If Aunt Helen's going to be there...
M	DAVID	Of course!
M	JACK	I didn't want to put a spoke in anyone's wheels. But if you look at it from my angle...A bachelor, taking my daughter off to Paris...
M	DAVID	Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought it through properly. I do apologise, Jack. Would you prefer it if Helen took Jenny on her own? I don't mind. I've been to Paris before.
M	JACK	Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No, no. If Aunt Helen's going...
F	TINA	There are some things you must buy for us, and some things you only have to buy for us if you're a proper, true friend. (She points at Hattie, then at herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume. (She repeats the gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick. What have I forgotten?
F	HATTIE	Those funny cigarettes you were smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets each.
M	SMALL GIRL	Are you the girl going to Paris?
M	SMALL GIRL	Well are you or aren't you? Because I'd like some perfume.
F	MISS STUBBS	Jenny, the headmistress would like a word at the end of the lesson. I'm afraid that the legend of Mr Rochester may have travelled further than you intended.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Come.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Ah. Miss Mellor.
M	HEADMISTRESS	We're all very excited about your forthcoming trip to Paris. Our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds. Some of us can talk of little else.
M	HEADMISTRESS	An older man, I understand. A word of warning, Miss Mellor. sixth-form girl who has lost an important part of herself - perhaps the best part - while under our supervision. These things happen, regrettably. If, however, we are made aware of this loss, then of course the young lady in question would have to continue her studies elsewhere, if she still has any use for `A'-levels. Is that clear?
F	JENNY	Can I go now?
M	HEADMISTRESS	Please.
F	JENNY	There's no bed.
M	DAVID	Ah. I pushed the boat out and got us a suite.
F	JENNY	A suite!
M	DAVID	Well, if work stops us getting to Paris until tomorrow, then work can buy us a nice hotel room. Anyway, it's a special occasion, isn't it?
F	JENNY	I would have thought that tonight of all nights we only need a bedroom. Close on David's reaction - she hasn't forgotten that
M	DAVID	Hold on a second. I've got something.
F	JENNY	What on earth is that for?
M	DAVID	I thought....I thought we might want to practice.
F	JENNY	With a banana?
M	DAVID	I thought we'd get the messy bit over with first.
F	JENNY	David, I don't want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit.
M	DAVID	I'm sorry.
F	JENNY	Let's wait until we get to Paris. I think the moment might have gone.
M	DAVID	I'm sorry, Minnie. I'm such a fool. And David..... if tomorrow night does happen, it will never happen again, so...
M	DAVID	Why won't it ever happen again?
F	JENNY	Because the first time can only happen once.
M	DAVID	Oh.
F	JENNY	So, please...No Minnies. No baby- talk. I'm not old enough for baby- talk. Treat me like a grown-up.
F	JENNY	I know. Let's go and sit in our sitting-room.
M	DAVID	Hooray! I'll order some champagne.
M	DAVID	Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?
M	DAVID	And it wasn't too uncomfortable?
F	JENNY	Not after the...first bit. It's funny, though, isn't it? All that poetry, and all those songs and films, about something that lasts no time at all?
F	TINA	How can you go back to double French when you've had a weekend with an older man in a posh hotel in Paris? You wouldn't catch me coming anywhere near this dump.
F	JENNY	It wasn't all glamour. We spent half the weekend at Heathrow in a hotel suite .
F	HATTIE	A suite? Oh my God. Your life.
F	TINA	You're going to miss it. All the swanning around in posh hotels.
F	JENNY	Why will I need to miss it?
F	TINA	When you go to Oxford. Unless you're planning on being with David forever.
F	HATTIE	You're not, are you?
F	JENNY	God, no.
F	TINA	So? Won't you miss it?
F	HATTIE	We'll miss it.
F	MISS STUBBS	Jenny, could I have a word?
F	JENNY	I'll catch you up.
F	MISS STUBBS	You can do anything you want, Jenny. You know that. You're clever and you're pretty... But sometimes those things fight. I'm worried that at the moment clever Jenny and pretty Jenny are fighting.
F	JENNY	What do you mean?
F	MISS STUBBS	I couldn't bear it if clever Jenny lost. It's because of people like you that I plough through illiterate essays by Sandra Lovell about her pony. And there aren't many of you, I can tell you. One every few years. Is your boyfriend interested in clever Jenny?
F	JENNY	I think so.
F	MISS STUBBS	Interested enough to let her do what she wants?
F	JENNY	He couldn't stop me.
F	MISS STUBBS	He might not have to stop you. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
F	JENNY	I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.
F	MISS STUBBS	I'm telling you to go to Oxford. No matter what. Or you'll break my heart.
F	JENNY	Where did you go?
F	MISS STUBBS	Sorry?
F	JENNY	Where did you go? Which university?
F	MISS STUBBS	Girton. Cambridge.
F	JENNY	Oh.
F	MISS STUBBS	What does that mean? `Oh'?
F	JENNY	You're clever. And you're pretty. So presumably, Clever Miss Stubbs won. And here you are, reading all those pony essays. I don't know. These last few months, I've been to Paris, and to jazz clubs, and I've eaten in wonderful restaurants, and seen wonderful films, heard beautiful music...
F	MISS STUBBS	I'm sure you have. But I was filled up with beautiful things, books and music and conversation, in exactly the same way at Cambridge. And I didn't have to pay the same sort of price. Are you taking precautions, Jenny?
F	JENNY	It's nothing to do with that.
F	MISS STUBBS	Isn't it?
F	JENNY	Maybe our lives are always going to end up with pony essays. Or housework. And yes, maybe we'll go up to Oxford. But if we're all going to die the moment we graduate, maybe it's what we do before that counts.
F	MISS STUBBS	I'm sorry you think I'm dead.
F	JENNY	I don't think you're dead. But...
F	MISS STUBBS	You'd better get to your next class.
F	JENNY	And we know the person who owns this?
M	DAVID	Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a....
M	DANNY	A bastard.
M	DAVID	He's a business acquaintance, and we need to talk to him.
F	JENNY	I gathered that much. But why do we have to crawl around the West End looking for his car? Why don't you just make an appointment, if you want to see him? The men snigger.
M	DANNY	What? Ring his office? Talk to his secretary? That isn't how it works with him, dear.
M	DANNY	There he is.
M	DAVID	A bottle of champagne, please.
M	DANNY	Oh-ho. Champagne, eh?
M	DAVID	Don't be bashful.
F	HELEN	No. Be Sneezy.
M	DAVID	All right, then. If you won't tell them I will. Jenny got two As and a B in her mock-A levels.
M	DANNY	Fantastic.
F	HELEN	Congratulations.
F	JENNY	Thank you.
M	DAVID	The B was in Latin. But it's much better than it was, isn't it, Minnie?
F	HELEN	Don't worry.
F	JENNY	About what?
F	HELEN	Someone told me that in fifty years no-one will speak Latin, probably. Not even Latin people. So you shouldn't mind too much about your B.
M	DANNY	Well, I'm not sure you'd want him to marry your sister. I'm not even sure you'd want to talk to him in a night-club, come to that.
M	DANNY	You do know what you're doing, old chap? With Jenny?
M	DAVID	This is the one, Danny.
M	DANNY	We've heard that before.
M	DAVID	You can see she's different. She's got everything. You've got Helen, and....
M	DANNY	And you've got Helen with brains.
M	DAVID	Yes.
M	DANNY	I don't want to see her hurt.
F	JENNY	Have you...Have you bought any more paintings recently?
M	DANNY	Have I? Let's think? Oh, I picked up a little Piper the other day. A good `un, I think.
F	JENNY	I'm still trying to work out what makes good things good. It's hard, isn't it?
M	DANNY	The thing is, Jenny, you know, without necessarily being able to explain why. You've got taste. That's not even half the battle. That's the whole war.
M	DAVID	Jenny, we should go. It's late.
F	JENNY	Oh. Yes.
M	DANNY	Alas. One day, school will be over forever, and we can talk about art all night.
M	DAVID	You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?
M	DAVID	Wait there.
F	JENNY	What are you doing?
M	DAVID	Will you marry me?
F	JENNY	What were you looking for?
M	DAVID	I thought I had a ring. It wouldn't have been the right one. But it would have done for tonight.
F	JENNY	Oh, David.
M	DAVID	I'm serious.
F	JENNY	You're very sweet.
M	DAVID	What do you think?
F	JENNY	Please take me home.
F	TINA	How do you say `A penny for your thoughts?' in French?
F	HATTIE	A franc is too much, isn't it?
F	TINA	For her thoughts, yes. You'd be overpaying by about ninety-nine centimes.
M	HEADMISTRESS	I'm surprised that you two are standing in front of me. I'm not surprised to find you here, Miss Mellor, though I do feel rather like the judge who sent Al Capone to prison for tax evasion. We take a very dim view of smoking. We take an even dimmer view of some of your other behaviour, which as far as we know has taken place off school premises. Your appearance here today, however, allows me to remind you that we are trying to teach you how to become young ladies, not nightclub hostesses. In reality, of course, you are neither. You are merely silly little girls. Detention after school. Go away.
M	MAN ON THE RADIO	They do need some looking after, but nothing that will require too much work. Just leave them in your potting shed for a couple of weeks, and they'll look after themselves.
M	JACK	Oh, aye. The potting shed. Who does he think I am? Prince Rainier of Monaco?
F	JENNY	What if I got married instead of going to college?
M	JACK	Married?
F	JENNY	Married.
M	JACK	It would depend who it was, surely?
F	JENNY	Would it? That's interesting.
M	JACK	Course it would. I wouldn't want you married off just for the sake of it.
F	JENNY	Thanks.
F	MARJORIE	Has somebody asked you?
F	JENNY	Yes.
M	JACK	Who?
F	MARJORIE	What did you tell him?
F	JENNY	Nothing yet.
M	JACK	David?
F	JENNY	No. A man I just met walking his dog.
M	JACK	David's asked you to marry him? Bloody hell. Pardon my French.
F	MARJORIE	Do you have any choice? Or is it too late.
M	JACK	Of course she's got a choice. But it's an interesting one, isn't it? This is where you're supposed to say, "But what about Oxford?"
M	JACK	Well. Looked at it one way, you wouldn't really need to go now, would you? He's a man going places. And say what you like, but they know how to take care of their money, don't they? He'll see you're looked after.
F	JENNY	I wouldn't need to go. Would you like to expand on that?
M	JACK	You know what I mean.
F	JENNY	All that Latin! All those essays! What was the point? Why didn't you just send me out prowling round nightclubs? It would have been less trouble. And I might have had more fun.
M	JACK	We don't know about nightclubs. We knew about education. Anyway, it all turned out for the best.
F	JENNY	How?
M	JACK	He wouldn't have wanted you if you were thick, would he?
M	GIRL 1	May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Sings whoop jug I love thee.
F	MISS STUBBS	Yes, when it says `Sings', it means he sings those words.
F	MISS STUBBS	Never mind. Lear...
M	ANN	Does any here know me. This is not Lear. Does Lear walk thus?
F	TINA	No.
M	ANN	Speak thus?
M	ANN	Where are his eyes?
M	ANN	Either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied. Ha! Waking? Tis not so. Who is it that can tell me who I am?
F	JENNY	Ooh. Miss. Me. I can.
F	MISS STUBBS	Oh, Jenny.
F	JENNY	What?
F	MISS STUBBS	Take it off.
F	HATTIE	Oh my God. Is that really what I think it is? I'M GOING TO BE A BRIDESMAID!
F	MISS STUBBS	You know there's a school rule about jewelry.
F	JENNY	Half the girls in this room are wearing jewelry.
F	MISS STUBBS	Yes. But none of it is going to ruin their lives.
F	JENNY	We have a difference of opinion on that.
F	MISS STUBBS	Let's see who's right. Come with me.
F	MISS STUBBS	Please don't make me drag you out like a child.
M	HEADMISTRESS	How far advanced are these ridiculous plans? Have you set a date? Have you decided on a church?
F	JENNY	We won't be getting married in a church. David's Jewish.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware, I take it, that the Jews killed our Lord?
F	JENNY	And you're aware, I suppose, that our Lord was Jewish?
M	HEADMISTRESS	I suppose he told you that. We're all very sorry about what happened in the War. But there's no excuse for that sort of malicious and untruthful propaganda.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Anyway, I can now see that you are even more in need of responsible advice than I realised. Is it true that you don't intend to sit for your exams? And therefore you won't be applying for University?
F	JENNY	Yes, that's right.
M	HEADMISTRESS	What do you think you're doing?
F	JENNY	Nobody has been able to explain to me the point of University. of the exams, either.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Nobody does anything worth doing without a degree.
F	JENNY	And nobody does anything worth doing with one, either. No woman, anyway.
M	HEADMISTRESS	So what I do isn't worth doing. Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs Wilson, or any of us here.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Because none of us would be here without our degrees, you realise that, don't you? And yes, of course studying is hard, and boring, and...
F	JENNY	Boring!
M	HEADMISTRESS	I'm sorry?
F	JENNY	Studying is hard and boring. Teaching is hard and boring. So you're telling me to be bored, and then bored, and then finally bored again, this time for the rest of my life. This whole stupid country is bored. There's no life in it, or colour in it, or fun in it. It's probably just as well that the Russians are going to drop a nuclear bomb on us any day now. So my choice is either to do something hard and boring, OR to marry my... my Jew, and go to Paris and Rome and listen to jazz and read and eat good food in nice restaurants and have fun. It's not enough to educate us any more, Mrs Walters. You've got to tell us why you're doing it.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Because without formal qualifications...
M	HEADMISTRESS	It doesn't have to be teaching, you know. There's the Civil Service.
F	JENNY	I don't wish to be impertinent, Mrs Walters. But it is an argument worth rehearsing. You never know. Someone else might want to know what the point of it all is, one day.
M	JACK	How d'you mean, left?
M	JACK	What about your exams?
F	JENNY	I'm not sitting them.
M	JACK	What are we going to tell people?
F	JENNY	Oh, telling people. I'd forgotten that what we tell people is more important than anything.
M	JACK	All that...
F	MARJORIE	Jack!
M	JACK	No. No need for Jack. She should hear it. All that money! Do you know how much it's cost me for you to go through school and take no exams?
F	JENNY	I'm sure David will pay you back. Send him a bill. As you said, he wouldn't have wanted me if I was dim, so he should fork out. Just tell me why there's a point in sitting my exams, and there's no point in me going to University.
M	JACK	You know what your trouble is, don't you? You're too clever by half.
F	JENNY	In which case I should have left school years ago, shouldn't I? Ask them for the money back. If I'm too clever by half, you overpaid by a third.
F	HELEN	That's...Gosh. That's fantastic news. Danny isn't so pleased.
M	DANNY	Congratulations.
F	HELEN	I thought you'd see sense about university. You'll stay pretty now.
F	JENNY	Am I still allowed to read?
F	HELEN	English? Books?
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	You won't be laughing when she goes all speccy and spotty, David.
F	JENNY	Danny didn't seem very pleased about our engagement. I thought that, too! I was wondering whether he might be a bit jealous.
F	JENNY	Jealous?
M	DAVID	You may have noticed that Helen's not really Oxford material. I'm going to keep him out of your way.
M	DAVID	I haven't put my...my stamp on it yet. Haven't had time. It needs a woman's touch, really. And if you don't like it, we can move. Just say the word.
F	JENNY	Where is the flat again?
F	MARJORIE	You have to put the cosy on straight away.
F	JENNY	Like that?
F	MARJORIE	No. On the tea-pot.
F	JENNY	Ah.
M	DAVID	Just down from Russell Square. Two minutes' walk from the underground.
F	MARJORIE	Jenny! We could walk to...(She tries to think of somewhere Jenny might find interesting.) We could walk to the British Museum!
F	MARJORIE	I'll leave you to it. Don't let it stew.
F	JENNY	And this is where you're living?
M	DAVID	I've stayed there for the last couple of nights. (Beat) On and off.
F	JENNY	You've stayed there two nights "on and off"?
M	DAVID	Is that tea ready? One sugar, please.
F	JENNY	David!
M	DAVID	I'm sorry. You must think I'm very odd.
F	JENNY	No, but.... You seem to float around. I never know where you are.
M	DAVID	A wandering Jew.(He pauses to take a sip.) If I tell you something, will you promise not to laugh?
F	JENNY	It depends on how funny it is.
M	DAVID	I live at home.
F	JENNY	We all live at home.
M	DAVID	No. I mean...I live at home...in the same way that you live at home.
F	JENNY	But I live with my mother and fa...(It clicks.) You don't mean it.
F	JENNY	Your mother and father?
M	DAVID	Just my mother. My father's dead. I've been meaning to tell you, Minnie, and it would have been much better than all those silly lies. But...
M	DAVID	Anyway. You can see how much I need you. And you won't regret this, I promise. We'll have so much fun. And just think. When we get married, you won't have to wait in the car while I do my business.. You'll be waiting at home, looking at the Burne-Jones on the wall. Home, Minnie. Our home. Can you imagine? Did you do this one? "Show from any TWO scenes in `Pride and Prejudice' how far it is true that Jane Austen's methods are `essentially dramatic'".
F	HATTIE	Three scenes.
F	JENNY	It says two here. Look.
F	HATTIE	Two. Two. Two. I can't believe it.
F	TINA	It was an unfair question. You're hopeless at maths. What do you do all day, anyway, Lady Muck?
F	JENNY	I've been looking at flats. I've been to look at dresses. I've been reading a lot, too.
F	TINA	Reading, trying on dresses... Where did we go wrong?
F	JENNY	
F	TINA	French. The translation paper.
F	MARJORIE	Don't worry. He'll find a nice place in no time. He sees plenty of them.
F	JENNY	I'm not sure he sees plenty of nice places.
M	Would you like a radiogram for a	wedding present? We love ours.
F	MARJORIE	You won't be bored, you know. He's not boring.
M	JACK	What sort of things can you have for starters? I mean, how will I know what are starters and what aren't? I'm all right if it's soup or fruit juice. But if it's anything more than that...
F	JENNY	We've been through this, Dad. It'll be quite clearly marked on the menu.
M	JACK	Why don't you three go out? I'll be happy here with a tin of...
M	DAVID	Everybody ready? I think you'll like this place, Jack. Their wine list is as good as anything I've seen in London.
M	JACK	Someone told me that.
F	JENNY	David, probably. Who else would it have been?
M	JACK	I was hoping you'd take us in this.
M	DAVID	Oh, you won't want to go in anything else after tonight. Mind you, it drinks petrol. I'm afraid we'll have to stop on the way in to town.
M	DAVID	Madame. Monsieur.
M	DAVID	Everyone happy?
M	JACK	I feel like Eamonn Andrews.
M	DAVID	Is that a good thing?
F	MARJORIE	Of course. Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person that Jack can imagine being.
M	DAVID	Sorry about this.
M	ATTENDANT	How can I help you, sir?
M	DAVID	You might as well fill her up.
M	DAVID	I'm just going to make a quick call. I'll be two ticks.
M	JACK	Do you think we should offer him some petrol money? Or would he feel insulted?
M	JACK	He'd feel insulted, probably. He said tonight was his treat. That must include the petrol, for God's sakes?
M	JACK	What do you think?
M	JACK	God almighty. What have I done?
M	DAVID	Jenny!
M	DAVID	Jenny, I...
F	JENNY	Take us home.
M	JACK	What's going on?
M	DAVID	There's been a...Jenny's had a bit of a shock.
M	JACK	What's happened?
F	JENNY	It's another one of David's little muddles and misunderstandings.
M	DAVID	Jenny, it's not...
F	JENNY	I don't want to hear another word from anybody. Take me home. NOW.
M	JACK	You can sort this out, can't you, David?
M	DAVID	Of course I can. She's just got the wrong end of the stick about something.
F	JENNY	Go inside, Dad.
F	JENNY	Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David Goldman..
M	DAVID	Just let me...
F	JENNY	You're MARRIED!
M	DAVID	Legally, yes, but...
F	JENNY	When were you going to tell me?
M	DAVID	Soon. It just - it never seemed the right time. You seemed so happy, and I was happy, and...It would have spoiled everything. What can I do, Minnie? What can I do? How can...
F	JENNY	"Oh, Jenny. I'm just too busy to find somewhere to live...I live with my mummy." You were living with your wife! All this time!
M	DAVID	Jenny...
F	JENNY	What's your address?
F	JENNY	Where?
M	DAVID	Byron Avenue.
F	JENNY	Byron Avenue! It's no wonder we kept bumping into each other, then, is it? What number?
M	DAVID	There's no point..
F	JENNY	WHAT NUMBER?
M	DAVID	Seventeen.
F	JENNY	Good grief. It's the truth.
M	DAVID	Please. You have to understand. I was with you just about all the spare time I had.
F	JENNY	Spare time? Spare time? I can't tell you how grateful I am.
M	DAVID	Don't be like this.
F	JENNY	I have nothing. I left school. I didn't take my exams. Where's it all gone, now? I gave my life away.
M	DAVID	Jenny, I can get a divorce. Everything will turn out for the best. You'll see.
F	JENNY	Go and tell them. Go and tell them, then go and tell your wife. I want to see you. I want to stand there and watch.
M	DAVID	They're not going to listen to me now. Let me come round tomorrow. When everyone's calmed down a bit.
F	JENNY	Please don't leave me to tell them on my own. Please. You owe me that much. You owe them that much.
M	DAVID	I owe them a lot more than that. I owe them everything. They gave me you.
F	JENNY	Two minutes. And then I'll come out and drag you in.
M	JACK	What's going on?
F	JENNY	He's helping himself to some Dutch courage before facing you. Stolen Dutch courage, from the look of it. He has something to tell you.
M	JACK	He just drove off.
M	JACK	Can you tell us? Please? Jenny?
M	WIFE	Oh. Hello.
F	JENNY	Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must have the wrong house.
F	JENNY	Yes. I wanted number...It's my cello lesson. Silly. I...
M	WIFE	Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God. You're a child.
M	WIFE	No. No. You stay here. If you're old enough to sleep with him, you're old enough to look at me.
F	JENNY	I can't.
M	WIFE	You didn't know about any of this. Presumably.
M	WIFE	No. They never do. Did he ask you to marry him?
M	WIFE	Yes. Of course he did. You're not in the family way, are you? Because that's happened before.
M	WIFE	Thank God for that. At least you can escape intact. (Beat) Relatively speaking. Not all of them have done.
M	WIFE	That's why he never goes through with anything. He does love them.
F	JENNY	She's beautiful.
M	WIFE	Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's four months old.
F	JENNY	Four months!
M	WIFE	Yes. Babies often are that sort of age. Perhaps you can remember a night four months ago when he seemed a little distracted. Anyway. If you'll excuse us.
F	MARJORIE	Did you see her?
F	JENNY	I saw her. I didn't talk to her. There wasn't any need.
M	JACK	Well we've got to have this out. If you won't do it, I will.
F	JENNY	Sit down.
M	JACK	I beg your pardon? I'm still your father, Jenny.
F	JENNY	Oh, you're my father again, are you? What were you when you encouraged me to throw my life away? I'm a silly schoolgirl. Was, anyway. Silly schoolgirls are always being seduced by glamorous older men. But what about you two?
M	JACK	We didn't...
F	JENNY	And now I've got nothing. I'm...I'm broken.
M	JACK	That doesn't mean....what I think it means, does it? It can't.
F	JENNY	What are you talking about?
M	JACK	Just tell me that you didn't...you haven't, you know...You didn't....
F	MARJORIE	I wondered how stupid you were. Now I know.
M	JACK (O.S.)	Jenny.
M	JACK	There's a cup of tea for you here.
M	JACK	I know I made a mess of everything.
M	JACK	All my life I've been scared, and I didn't want you to be scared. That's why I wanted you to go to Oxford. So that if someone asked you out to a nice restaurant, you wouldn't panic about what was a starter and what was a main course. And then David came along, and he had money, and he knew famous writers, and he knew how to get to classical music concerts. But he wasn't who he said he was. He wasn't who you said he was, either.
M	JACK	The other day, your mother and I were listening to a programme about CS Lewis on the radio, and they said he moved to Cambridge in 1954. And I said to Marjorie, Well, they've got that wrong, because how would our Jenny get her book signed, if he wasn't in Oxford?
M	JACK (O.S.)	Jenny, I'm sorry.
F	HELEN	I don't really understand what difference it makes. When I found out that...
M	DANNY	Helen! Not now.
M	DANNY	I tried to tell him. I'm not speaking to him now, if that's any consolation.
F	JENNY	It's a funny world you people live in. You both watched me... carrying on with a married man, but you don't think it's worth saying anything.
M	DANNY	Ah, well if you want that sort of conversation...You watched David and I help ourselves to a map, and you didn't say much, either.
M	HEADMISTRESS	So. Your Jewish friend turned out to be married already, I understand. How unfortunate.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Anyway. How do you think we can help?
F	JENNY	I'd like to repeat my last year at school. Start all over again.
M	HEADMISTRESS	I got the impression the last time we spoke that you didn't see the point of school. Or of me, or of any of us here.
F	JENNY	I know. I was stupid.
M	HEADMISTRESS	So what is the point?
F	JENNY	I know that I need to go to university.
M	HEADMISTRESS	And what happens if some other chap wants to marry you during your studies next year?
F	JENNY	Some other chap? There won't be any other chaps. Not for a long, long time, anyway.
M	HEADMISTRESS	I'm afraid I think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. No,I think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. You showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. And I must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now.
F	JENNY	Is it really so grim, your satisfaction?
M	HEADMISTRESS	It gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away. Although, of course, you're not one of our schoolgirls any more. Through your own volition.
F	JENNY	I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman.
M	HEADMISTRESS	Oh, you're not a woman.
F	TINA	I'm sure my uncle knows someone who could kill him. If that would help.
F	HATTIE	We should have stopped you.
F	JENNY	Did you want to?
F	TINA	Of course we didn't. Why would we stop you? Restaurants, hotels, foreign cities, no exams...
F	JENNY	Yes. Who'd have thought there'd be a down side to all that? I could tell you all about the imagery in Jane Eyre. But I couldn't see that a man who stole maps from old ladies might be a liar.
F	HATTIE	Well, if you'd told us that we might have tried to stop you.
F	JENNY	There are a lot of things I didn't tell you. I was dreaming.
F	TINA	That's the thing about our lives, isn't it? It's so easy to fall asleep, when there's nothing to keep you awake.
F	HATTIE	Are you getting on with the work all right on your own?
F	JENNY	No. No, I'm not.
F	MISS STUBBS	Jenny!
F	JENNY	This is lovely.
F	JENNY	But it is. Really. I'd love to live somewhere like this.
F	MISS STUBBS	Oh, it's not hard. Go to Oxford and become a teacher and this is what you end up with.
F	JENNY	But all these books and pictures....
F	MISS STUBBS	Penguin paperbacks. Posters and postcards.
F	JENNY	Yes, but...That's all you need, isn't it? said those silly things. I didn't understand.
F	MISS STUBBS	Let's forget all about it.
F	JENNY	A Burne-Jones.
F	JENNY	What?
F	MISS STUBBS	You make it sound as though it's an original. Do you like him?
F	JENNY	Yes. I do. Still.
F	MISS STUBBS	Still? Gosh, you sound very old and wise.
F	JENNY	I feel old. But really not very wise. Miss Stubbs, I'm....I need your help.
F	MISS STUBBS	I was so hoping that's what you were going to say.
M	DAVID	Jenny.
M	DAVID	Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell you that I am going to ask my wife for a divorce.
F	JENNY	Don't you understand what you've done?
M	DAVID	I can see my behaviour must have been... confusing. But we've never sat down and had a proper chat about it all. About the whys and wherefores. They can wait. The important thing is that you're still my Minnie Mouse, and I love you, and you had fun. You know you had fun.
F	JENNY	Yes. I had fun. But I had fun with the wrong person, at all the wrong times. And I can't ever get those times back, now.(Beat) Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every day I wake up and pinch myself. And when I think how close I came...
