M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	TOM	Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?
F	CHRISSIE	C'mon!
F	CHRISSIE	Tommy? Don't dunk me...
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Hayes Landing reports conditions good, with stripers and jacks. The Coast Guard has no storm warning from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; a light chop with freshening winds, continued clear and mild... (etc.)
F	BRODY	How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
F	ELLEN	'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
F	BRODY	Right.
F	ELLEN	Do you see the kids?
F	BRODY	Probably out in the back yard.
F	ELLEN	In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
F	BRODY	The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
F	ELLEN	Like you're from N'Yawk.
F	BRODY	Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
F	BRODY	Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
M	ELLEN (O.S.)	I never hear the whistle.
F	BRODY	Feed the dogs.
F	ELLEN	You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
F	BRODY	I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it.
F	ELLEN	Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
M	MICHAEL	Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
F	BRODY	On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?
F	ELLEN	Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid.
F	ELLEN	Don't forget these.
F	BRODY	Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
F	ELLEN	I think they make you look sexy.
F	BRODY	Sexy, hm? What was I before?
F	ELLEN	Older, sillier.
F	BRODY	I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
F	BRODY	Let's see...
F	BRODY	Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... Well, what do they usually do, float or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll meet both of you at the beach in ...20 minutes, okay? Okay. First goddamn weekend of the summer.
F	ELLEN	There. What was that?
F	BRODY	The office.
F	ELLEN	Be careful.
F	BRODY	Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
F	BRODY	Love ya.
F	ELLEN	Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
F	BRODY	Christine what?
M	CASSIDY	Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
F	BRODY	You picked her up on the ferry.
M	CASSIDY	I didn't know her.
F	BRODY	And nobody else saw her in the water?
M	CASSIDY	Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
F	BRODY	Think she might've run out on you?
M	CASSIDY	Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
F	BRODY	You from around here?
M	CASSIDY	No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
F	BRODY	You here for the summer?
M	CASSIDY	Some friends and me took a house.
F	BRODY	What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
M	CASSIDY	A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
F	BRODY	Pretty stiff.
F	BRODY	Maybe that's your girl.
M	CASSIDY	You can't make me look -- !
F	BRODY	If this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there. The 'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?
F	POLLY	This is in no order of importance, Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity Town Council on Aging this Monday night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire Inspector wants you to go over the fireworks site with him before he catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly, you have a batch of calls about that new Karate school.
F	POLLY	Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's those nine-year-olds from the school practicing karate on all those nice picket fences.
F	POLLY	It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away in the night?
F	BRODY	Jesus, Santos.
F	POLLY	What's the matter?
F	BRODY	Polly, I want to know what water recreation is on for today.
F	POLLY	Right this minute?
F	BRODY	Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
M	HENDRICKS	We never had any. What's the problem?
M	LOCAL MERCHANT	Glad I caught you. There's a city truck with New Hampshire plates parked right in front of my...
M	KEISEL	Wait-a-minute. Glasses, right?
M	KEISEL	Look at those fences! Little guys about eight to ten years old. And look at this!
M	KEISEL	They did that with their bare hands.
F	BRODY	Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?
M	LYNWOOD	Stuff's no good to me in August when the Pilgrims come in June... Go on and help yourself to whatever you need, Chief. Can you work the register?
M	HENDRICKS	Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
F	BRODY	Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
M	HENDRICKS	What's the matter with my printing?
M	VAUGHN	What have you got there, Lenny?
M	HENDRICKS	We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
M	VAUGHN	Who've you told this to, Lenny?
M	HENDRICKS	I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
M	VAUGHN	Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny.
M	HENDRICKS	I've got all these signs here...
M	VAUGHN	C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
M	SCOUTMASTER	Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, keep kicking...
M	VAUGHN	Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
F	BRODY	Do I need any more authority?
M	MEADOWS	Technically, you need the instruction of a civic ordinance, or a special meeting of the town selectmen...
M	VAUGHN	That's just going by the book. We're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. This is your first summer.
F	BRODY	Now tell me something I don't know.
M	VAUGHN	All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
F	BRODY	So we should set out a smorgasbord?
M	MEADOWS	We're not even sure what it was.
F	BRODY	What else could've done that?
M	VAUGHN	Boat propeller?
M	DOCTOR	I think, possibly... sure. A boating accident.
M	VAUGHN	Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along --
M	MEADOWS	Remember when Fred Ganz went scalloping in his BVD's? He was going to swim to New Bedford, he said.
M	MEADOWS	...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
F	BRODY	Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
M	DOCTOR	I was wrong. We'll have to amend the report.
M	MEADOWS	We never had that kind of trouble here.
M	VAUGHN	I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
F	BRODY	I was only reacting to what I was told.
M	VAUGHN	It's all psychological, anyway. You yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've got a panic on our hands. I think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of July.
F	BRODY	I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
M	VAUGHN	Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
M	VAUGHN	We need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things.
M	MEADOWS	You have our complete support.
M	VAUGHN	Now then. We've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about...
M	SHOPKEEPER	Hello, Mr. Quint.
M	QUINT	Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, Okay? I ordered them.
M	SHOPKEEPER	Yessir, right here. What do those fish do, eat this stuff?
M	QUINT	They choke on it.
M	SHOPKEEPER	Bye now.
M	MAX TAFT	Looks like another big season. Gets worse every year.
F	MRS. TAFT	And none of them from the Island. Just a lot of bother.
F	BRODY	What?
F	TAFT	Present company excepted, but off- islanders are a pain in the butt. Pardon my French.
F	ELLEN	What about this kid? What if he were born here. That make him an islander?
F	TAFT	Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an oven, it don't make them muffins.
M	SEAN	I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!
F	MRS. KINTNER	Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you think you're going?
M	ALEX	Water. Just once more, please?
F	MRS. KINTNER	Let me see your fingers --
F	MRS. KINTNER	They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes more.
F	ELLEN	Do you want the boys to come in? Honey, if you're worried...
F	BRODY	How's the water?
M	KEISEL	Too cold. I'm going in again Labor Day. Hope we get this weather next weekend.
F	ELLEN	You're very tight, y'know? Right there.
F	BRODY	Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water...
M	DOG MAN	Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy! He continues to ad lib calling his dog, but there's no answer, no dog in the water.
M	A KID (MATHEW)	Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!
M	TOURIST	Something in the water. Right there! Didn't anyone see it?
M	WOMAN	There's blood in the water.
F	ELLEN	What is it...?
F	BRODY	Michael! Sean! Out of the water. Everybody out of the water! Michael! Get out!
F	MRS. KINTNER	Alex! Alex? Alex...!
F	BRODY	Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
M	MEADOWS	I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
F	BRODY	I'm responsible for public safety around here...
M	VAUGHN	Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt. Everybody, could I have your attention? Since this affects all of us, I suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room...
M	VAUGHN	Well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions?
M	DENHERDER	Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in cash or check?
M	VAUGHN	That's private business between you brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. -- Chief --
F	BRODY	I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
M	MEADOWS	What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
F	BRODY	I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
M	VAUGHN	No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
M	WOMAN	Are you going to close the beaches?
F	BRODY	Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time.
M	VAUGHN	Only 24 hours!
F	BRODY	I didn't agree to that!
F	MRS. TAFT	That official business could take all summer!
M	MR. KEISEL	Maybe it's better to close.
M	MR. WISEMAN	We should make sure there is no danger.
M	MR. HASSETT	I didn't raise my kids to be some fish's lunch!
F	MRS. TAFT	The motel is all I own -- you pull the plug on this town and I go down the drain with it.
M	MR. POSNER	Nobody's seen a shark.
M	MR. POLK	We'll lose business, we lose taxes, we lose our shirts!
M	QUINT	You all know me. You know what I do for a living. I'll go out and get this bird for you. He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow a man whole. A little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go. You gotta get this fellow and get him quick. If you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis. A shark of that size is no pleasure and I value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks. I'll find him for three. But I'll kill him for ten.
M	QUINT	The bastard is costing you more'n that every day. Do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter. I'm gonna kill this thing... just a matter of whether I do it now -- or at the end of summer.
M	VAUGHN	Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the Selectmen will take your offer under advisement
F	ELLEN	Can you stand something to eat?
F	BRODY	Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
F	ELLEN	Mikey loves his birthday present.
F	BRODY	Where is he?
F	ELLEN	He's sitting in it.
F	ELLEN	Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty with a double-knot.
F	BRODY	Son! -- Out of the water now!
M	MICHAEL	My boat's neat, dad!
F	BRODY	I want him out of the ocean.
F	ELLEN	It's three feet deep, Martin
F	BRODY	Michael! Come inside!
F	ELLEN	It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
F	BRODY	I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
F	ELLEN	You heard your father! Out right now!
M	DENHERDER	You wanna call it a night after here?
M	CHARLIE	It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
M	DENHERDER	Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
M	DENHERDER	Leg of lamb this time?
M	CHARLIE	Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
M	DENHERDER	We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
M	DENHERDER	One more after this, then I'm going home.
M	CHARLIE	Set?
M	CHARLIE	Tide's taking it right out.
M	DENHERDER	You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Twenty years.
M	DENHERDER	I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
M	DENHERDER	Hey! What's this?
M	CHARLIE	Look at him take it!
M	DENHERDER	Do I set the goddam hook?
M	CHARLIE	Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
M	DENHERDER	CHARLIE! JUMP!
M	CHARLIE	Holy Jesus Christ!
M	DENHERDER	Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!
M	HENDRICKS	...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
F	BRODY	That wasn't funny.
M	HENDRICKS	Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
F	BRODY	Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
M	OUT-OF-TOWNER	You're charging me double the usual rent! I didn't come up here all the way from New Rochelle to be gouged by some Yankee Cracker!
M	BOAT RENTAL MAN	Prices go up June First every year. You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, you go down to the Hamptons. Right, Chief?
F	BRODY	Hey! You know how many men that's supposed to hold?
M	MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)	Whatever's safe, right?
F	BRODY	What you got ain't safe. You take some guys off or you don't go out.
M	HOOPER	Hello.
M	GARDNER	Hello, back.
F	BRODY	You going out too, Ben?
M	GARDNER	Might give it a try. That three thousand bounty beats working for a living. We ready?
F	BRODY	Just back up! No, the other way! Cut it to your left! Your other left! The big boat, your front end is out way too far. Little boat, stay still!
M	SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)	Dammit, a vessel under sail has the right of way!
M	SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)	You schmuck, you ain't under sail, you're goddam drifting!
M	HOOPER	Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, scull it out!
M	SAILBOAT SKIPPER	Tell that stinkpotter to belay!
M	MOTORBOAT SKIPPER	Tell that ragsetter I'm going to poke him in the snoot!
M	HOOPER	Just cast off in turn and make for the channel, OK?
F	BRODY	Thanks.
M	HOOPER	Excuse me, I wonder if you could tell me...
M	HOOPER	Is that dynamite?
F	BRODY	If that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port.
M	MAN	Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks like fireworks, it attracts them.
F	BRODY	Hand it over.
M	HOOPER	There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
F	BRODY	You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
M	HOOPER	Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
F	BRODY	Who are you?
M	HOOPER	Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.
M	PRATT	Well, get over there! He ain't caught it yet!
M	PRATT	Hand me that pole! Quick!
M	HARRY	Beat it! I hooked him!
M	PRATT	How's the family, Harry? Go on and do it!
M	MAN WITH GAFF	We split down the middle?
M	HARRY	Let go my shark!
F	BRODY	Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
M	HOOPER	Victim One, identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian...
M	HOOPER	...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard?
F	BRODY	No, it was local jurisdiction.
M	HOOPER	Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
F	BRODY	No, we just checked the beach...
M	HOOPER	It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
M	MEADOWS	Ginny, get this out on the state wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New York. Have one of them pick it up for the national and call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him this is from me and he owes me one... let's get a picture.
M	HOOPER	Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
F	BRODY	You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
M	MEADOWS	Okay, everybody, I want to get a picture for the paper -- could everyone clear out of the way?
M	MEADOWS	Could you get out of the shot, young man?
M	HOOPER	Who, me? Okay...
F	BRODY	Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
M	VAUGHN	That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
F	BRODY	Sure he is.
M	HOOPER (O.S.)	It's a tiger shark. Very rare in these waters, and definitely a maneater.
M	VAUGHN	Who's that young man?
F	BRODY	Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
M	VAUGHN	I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
M	PRATT	Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's that?
M	GAFFER	Teeth are teeth, right?
M	HOOPER	I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
F	BRODY	What d'ya mean?
M	HOOPER	There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
M	VAUGHN	That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
M	HOOPER	Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
F	BRODY	Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
M	VAUGHN	Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need?
M	MEADOWS	Plenty.
M	HOOPER	Wait a minute...
M	VAUGHN	I am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock. Besides...
M	VAUGHN	Chief, I'll take responsibility for this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl take him out and dump him right in the drink.
F	MRS. KINTNER	Chief Brody?
F	MRS. KINTNER	My Alex was a beautiful little boy and you killed him. Did you know that? You knew there was a shark out there. You knew a girl got killed here last week. I just found that out. But you knew. You knew it was dangerous, but you let people go swimming anyway. You knew all those things, and still my boy is dead now and there's nothing you can do about that. My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that.
M	VAUGHN	I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
M	HOOPER	Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
F	BRODY	She's right.
M	VAUGHN	Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
F	BRODY	I'm going home.
F	BRODY	C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.
M	SEAN	Why? Because he needs it.
M	HOOPER (O.S.)	Martin Brody residence?
M	HOOPER	Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
F	ELLEN	So would I. Come on in.
F	ELLEN	Would you like something? Some coffee?
M	HOOPER	Is anyone having this...?
M	HOOPER	Dynamite! How was your day...?
F	BRODY	Swell.
M	HOOPER	Here... one red, one white.
M	HOOPER	Ummm. Really good.
F	ELLEN	My husband tells me you're in sharks.
M	HOOPER	I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
F	ELLEN	You love sharks?
M	HOOPER	I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
F	BRODY	How come you have to tell them that?
F	ELLEN	Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
M	HOOPER	They caught a shark, not the shark. Big difference. I could've proved it this afternoon, by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents. Also, his bite was too small.
M	HOOPER	I was lucky to find that in town -- it's an estate bottled vintage year...
M	HOOPER	We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
F	BRODY	Let's all have a drink.
F	BRODY	You too, sweetheart...
F	ELLEN	Thank you.
M	HOOPER	Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
F	ELLEN	You're leaving?
M	HOOPER	Going out on the 'Aurora.'
F	ELLEN	Is that a boat?
M	HOOPER	Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
F	ELLEN	Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
M	HOOPER	Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
F	ELLEN	I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
M	HOOPER	Yep.
F	ELLEN	Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
F	BRODY	Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
M	HOOPER	Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
F	BRODY	Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
M	HOOPER	About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
F	BRODY	There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
M	HOOPER	Rogue?
F	BRODY	Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
M	HOOPER	It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
F	BRODY	And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
M	HOOPER	You could say that.
F	BRODY	Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
F	ELLEN	Can you do that?
F	BRODY	I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come?
M	HOOPER	I'm flattered you should ask.
M	HOOPER	...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
F	BRODY	What stinks so bad?
M	HOOPER	Our friend, the shark.
M	HOOPER	We always had a summer place on the water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I figured I'd major in something I knew about. Oceanography, marine biology. It was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. Hold the light.
M	HOOPER	We open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract. Simple.
F	BRODY	What's that?
M	HOOPER	Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
F	BRODY	What? What?!
M	HOOPER	Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
F	BRODY	How can you tell?
M	HOOPER	Florida license plate.
F	BRODY	He ate a car?
M	HOOPER	No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
M	HOOPER	...Nothing.
F	BRODY	What do we do?
M	HOOPER	If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
F	BRODY	Chum?
M	HOOPER	Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
M	HOOPER	That's the Cape Light -- we're on the stretch where he's feeding, if he's still here.
F	BRODY	What is all this stuff?
M	HOOPER	Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
F	BRODY	Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
M	HOOPER	Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
F	BRODY	Where'd you get all this?
M	HOOPER	I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
F	BRODY	You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
M	HOOPER	It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
F	BRODY	We gotta get back soon...
F	BRODY	Hey!
F	BRODY	What the hell?
F	BRODY	That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the Flicka! Ben? Ben!
F	BRODY	What happened?
M	HOOPER	I want to check something. Hold my feet.
F	BRODY	Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
M	HOOPER	They must've hit something.
M	HOOPER	He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
F	BRODY	Why don't we just tow it in?
M	HOOPER	We will. There's something I've got to find out.
F	BRODY	Be careful, for chrissake.
F	BRODY	You all right?
M	HOOPER	A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
F	BRODY	No shark did that to a boat!
M	HOOPER	Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd believe it! We're not talking about a shark, we're talking about a Shark!
F	BRODY	There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
M	HOOPER	You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
F	BRODY	There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
M	HOOPER	A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
F	BRODY	A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
M	HOOPER	I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
F	BRODY	We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
M	VAUGHN	Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
M	HOOPER	I don't have it.
F	BRODY	He lost it on the way up.
M	VAUGHN	What kind of a shark did you say it was?
M	HOOPER	Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
M	VAUGHN	Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
F	BRODY	We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
M	HOOPER	I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
F	BRODY	That means closing the beaches.
M	VAUGHN	Come here, I want to show you something.
M	VAUGHN	Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
M	HOOPER	That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
F	BRODY	Wait a minute! I need you.
M	HOOPER	Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks.
M	VAUGHN	You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
F	BRODY	Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
M	VAUGHN	August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
M	OFFICER	Martin Brody? I'll need your signature here... here... and here.
F	BRODY	What is this?
M	OFFICER	Authorization for direct payment of flight expenses not directly connected to a normal mission of this command. You pay for the gas.
F	BRODY	I signed on the wrong line...
M	OFFICER	Just erase your signature and initial your erasure.
F	BRODY	I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and I hope we won't actually be needing your services. But I'm glad to have you here.
M	ENSIGN	I want to get our lines and repellent out, so we better shove off.
F	BRODY	We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay?
M	HOOPER	I hope we get some more help.
F	BRODY	I wish it would rain...
M	TV DIRECTOR	Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 1. Roll.
M	ANNOUNCER	...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how about those rumors?
M	VAUGHN	How about them indeed. I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here. As you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time. Amity, y'know, means 'Friendship.'
M	ANNOUNCER	Also here today is a Marine Biologist and Research Fellow from the Oceanographic Institute, Matthew Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?
M	HOOPER	What I've heard and what I've seen are two different things. I believe there is a large Great White Shark -- Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters off this very beach, that he has killed and that he will kill again...
M	ANNOUNCER	And there you have it -- two different opinions, by men of good will. The holiday crowd here at Amity seems to be making up its own mind...
F	BRODY	I'm sorry, I just don't have the time.
M	TV DIRECTOR	Recue the machines. 2, pan off the Chief and show me some tits and ass. 1, get me some cute kids. 3... see if you got a shot at the water.
M	ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 seconds. That's equal time, right?
M	DIRECTOR	Right. Jerry, come on in and look at this. Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)	Amity Island is famed for its clear air and white sand beaches. But a cloud appeared...
M	ANNOUNCER (LIVE)	Look at that shine on my nose. It's a beacon.
M	DIRECTOR	Close enough for remote.
M	VAUGHN (V.O.)	...I'm pleased and happy...
M	DIRECTOR	Think we ought to stick around?
M	ANNOUNCER	What else you got?
M	ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	Teachers' strike downtown.
M	CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Christenson, this is Al. Union says time for Engineering Five.
M	DIRECTOR	That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.
M	VAUGHN	Why don't you get in the water?
M	SELECTMAN	I don't want to wash off my suntan lotion. I'll get a burn...
M	VAUGHN	Nobody's going in!
M	WOMAN	Is there nobody going in? What a shame. Arthur, should I be going in?
M	ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)	If you'd like.
M	ARTHUR	It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite refreshing... Very pleasant....
M	ARTHUR	No sharks, m'lady.
M	WOMAN	This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to come back to this very spot. Will you make a note of where we are?
M	HENDRICKS	Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.
M	COPTER SPOTTER	Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over.
M	HENDRICKS	False alarm. Must be this glare.
M	VOICES	Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up to your knees, yeah -- So come with me -- I'll go again.
M	MEADOWS	Beautiful day, Chief!
F	BRODY	Hey Mikey -- !
F	BRODY	You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
M	MICHAEL	I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
F	BRODY	Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
M	MICHAEL	Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
F	BRODY	Just a favor for your old man.
M	MICHAEL	Sure, Dad.
M	COPTER SPOTTER	Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!
M	HENDRICKS	Where -- ?
M	COPTER SPOTTER	Went under your -- There!
M	SONAR OPERATOR	Jesus Christ -- Shark!
F	BRODY	Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please --
F	BRODY	No whistles! No whistles!
M	TV DIRECTOR	Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody get that!
M	THE VICTIM	extends one hand, as It's no good. I'm dead...
M	HOOPER	Block the estuary! The estuary!
F	BRODY	He's in shock. Get blankets!
M	NURSE	The doctor said it's okay -- mild shock. He can come home in the morning.
F	ELLEN	Hey, big guy -- you want anything from home?
M	MICHAEL	My cars. And a comic book.
F	BRODY	Here -- Take him home.
F	ELLEN	Home... New York?
F	BRODY	No. Home here.
F	BRODY	Got a pen on you?
M	VAUGHN	Why?
F	BRODY	There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
M	VAUGHN	I don't know if I can do that without a...
F	BRODY	I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
M	VAUGHN	Maybe we can save August...
F	BRODY	Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
M	VAUGHN	I was acting in the town's best interests...
F	BRODY	The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs.
M	VAUGHN	My kids were on that beach...
F	BRODY	Just sign it, Larry.
F	BRODY	This has got to be one big violation...
M	HOOPER	This is quite a place.
M	QUINT'S VOICE	Keep your hands off my stuff.
M	QUINT	Did you bring a check?
F	BRODY	What?
M	QUINT	Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
F	BRODY	I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price.
M	QUINT	And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
F	BRODY	You got it.
M	QUINT	And incidental damages, if any...
F	BRODY	You got it.
M	QUINT	And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
F	BRODY	You got it.
M	QUINT	And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
F	BRODY	Two cases. And dinner when you land.
M	QUINT	Try some of this. I made it myself.
M	QUINT	Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged women.
M	HERSCHEL	Mr. Quint...
M	HERSCHEL	I'm not goin'. No sir.
M	QUINT	You want to get paid, you go.
M	HERSCHEL	Forget the money. You can't pay me enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some big mean fish with you, but I ain't goin' on this one.
M	QUINT	This is the last time I hear from you. I don't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel. Put that blackfish on board, pump the bilges, and top off the fuel tanks, and finish up in the morning. Then you're on the beach.
M	HOOPER	You're going to need an extra hand...
F	BRODY	This is Matt Hooper...
M	QUINT	I know who he is...
F	BRODY	He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
M	HOOPER	I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
M	QUINT	Transplants?
M	HOOPER	-- and an America's Cup Trials...
M	QUINT	I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
M	HOOPER	And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
M	QUINT	Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
M	HOOPER	I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
M	QUINT	Let me see your hands...
M	QUINT	Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
M	HOOPER	Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
F	BRODY	Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... What do you mean 'We...?'
F	BRODY	It's my charter. My party.
M	QUINT	All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast.
F	BRODY	You got it.
M	QUINT	5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number 14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips, pliers, irons...
M	HOOPER	Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator, tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra magazines, cage...
M	ASSISTANT	You got everything you asked for?
M	HOOPER	All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for me. And tell Borack I'll catch up with them in New Zealand.
M	ASSISTANT	This is actually a killing expedition?
M	HOOPER	An eye for an eye, you know.
M	QUINT	Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
M	HOOPER	I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
M	QUINT	Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
M	HOOPER	Anti-Shark cage.
M	QUINT	Who's inside, you or the shark?
M	QUINT	You're in the cage? The cage is in the water? The shark is in the water too? You're in the water with the shark.
M	HOOPER	Comin' aboard...
F	ELLEN	Did you take your dramamine? Here.
M	QUINT	Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.
F	ELLEN	Is that him?
F	BRODY	Colorful, isn't he?
F	ELLEN	You going to be all right?
F	BRODY	Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
F	ELLEN	I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
M	QUINT (O.S.)	'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For 15 years she kept her virginity. Not a bad record for this vicinity.'
F	BRODY	Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
F	ELLEN	What'll I tell the kids?
F	BRODY	Tell 'em I went fishin'!
M	QUINT	Cast off the bow line! Now your stern!
M	QUINT	Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right... I'll throw your ass through that little round window.
M	QUINT	Now hear this. You're aboard the fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. You'll jump when I holler. We're doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't got time to watch you birds get hooks in your ass and fall overboard. Ship with me, and you'll do all right. Cross me, and I'll slap you upside your heads. Now -- if you boys are ready -- let's go fishin'.
M	QUINT	Here's something for you...
M	QUINT	These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts.
M	QUINT	Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em where you got it!
M	HOOPER	What's that supposed to prove?
M	QUINT	Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
M	QUINT	Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
F	BRODY	Who's driving the boat?
M	QUINT	Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
M	HOOPER	Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
M	QUINT	Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
M	QUINT	Get a fresh barrel.
M	HOOPER	Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
M	QUINT	Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me.
M	HOOPER	That's pilot whale, isn't it?
M	QUINT	It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
F	BRODY	Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
M	QUINT	...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
M	HOOPER	Easy for you -- they got a brain the size of a radish.
M	QUINT	Now if he weren't around, we'd of hooked something else by now, wouldn't we? But he scared 'em all away. Big lonesome son of a bitch...
M	QUINT	-- he'll gulp it down now... Hooooooo!
F	BRODY	You got it?
M	QUINT	Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick!
M	QUINT	Starboard, for Chris'sake --
M	QUINT	Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
M	HOOPER	Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
M	QUINT	Neutral! Where the hell is he going?
M	QUINT	Oh, this ain't foolin' me -- Sure -- try it!
M	QUINT	Makin' believe it's easy now.
M	QUINT	Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
M	HOOPER	Let it go, don't waste your time.
M	QUINT	Down here, Hooper!
M	HOOPER	I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
M	QUINT	Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
F	BRODY	The wire's showing!
M	QUINT	Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
M	HOOPER	It's too wild, too erratic. It's a marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.
M	QUINT	Watch your hands -- Grab onto this!
M	QUINT	A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
M	HOOPER	I'm okay...
M	QUINT	Fasten the pole.
F	BRODY	What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
M	QUINT	Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
F	BRODY	How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
M	QUINT	What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
M	QUINT	Over there!
M	HOOPER	What do you see?
M	QUINT	At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
M	HOOPER	20 feet, if it's an inch...
M	QUINT	25 feet. And three tons of him there.
M	QUINT	I never saw one that big.
F	BRODY	What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
F	BRODY	How're we gonna handle this?
M	HOOPER	There's a formula! Girth, about 150 inches, squared, divide by 800 -- son of a bitch, they are not going to believe this! -- divide by 2000... three tons! You're right, you old fart! Three tons!
M	RADIO VOICE (V.O.)	Amity Point Light Station to Orca. to Orca...
M	QUINT	Orca here. I have Mrs. Martin Brody here...
M	QUINT	Put her on.
M	ELLEN'S VOICE	...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
M	QUINT	This is Quint, Missus.
M	ELLEN'S VOICE	I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
M	QUINT	He's busy.
M	ELLEN'S VOICE	Well... is everything all right?
M	QUINT	Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
M	HOOPER	Damn it! I need something in the foreground to give it some scale. Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!
M	QUINT	Here. Rig this to the forward keg up there.
M	QUINT	Get up there and steer her. Follow my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've got to get a clean shot at that porker's head.
M	QUINT	Hurry up, rig the line!
M	QUINT	Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady now...
M	QUINT	The line, man, the line!
M	QUINT	Get clear, damn you!
M	HOOPER	Clear!
M	QUINT	Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!
M	QUINT	Now you've done it, you piss-ant. Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to my gear. Let the bastard fight the keg for a while. He can't stay down with that on.
M	HOOPER	Rig another keg! I'm bringing her around!
M	HOOPER	God damn it! We had him! I'm coming about!
F	BRODY	Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
M	QUINT	We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
F	BRODY	Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
M	QUINT	You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
M	QUINT	He's up again.
M	QUINT	That's not so bad. Look at this: ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, in Boston, where some sunovabitch winged me upside the head with a spittoon.
M	HOOPER	Look here. Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.
M	QUINT	Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
M	HOOPER	Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
M	QUINT	Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
M	HOOPER	Ever see one like this?
M	HOOPER	Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
M	QUINT	Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
M	QUINT	Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look just like somebody caressed me with a nutmeg grater...
M	HOOPER	I'll drink to your leg.
M	QUINT	And I'll drink to yours.
M	QUINT	Wait a minute, young fella. Look. Just look. Don't touch...
M	QUINT	...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
M	HOOPER	I think I can top that, Mister...
M	HOOPER	Gimme a hand, here. I got something to show you --
M	HOOPER	There. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary Ellen.
M	QUINT	And here's to the ladies. And here's to their sisters; I'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters.
M	QUINT	Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
F	BRODY	C'mon. Middle appendix --
M	QUINT	I almost had 'im.
F	BRODY	What's that one, there?
M	QUINT	Tattoo. Had it taken off.
M	HOOPER	Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
M	QUINT	'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
F	BRODY	What's that, a ship?
M	HOOPER	You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
M	QUINT	Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis. June 29th, 1945, three and a half minutes past midnight, two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side. Two or three. We was still under sealed orders after deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima bomb...we was goin' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn near eleven hundred men went over the side. The life boats was lashed down so tight to make the bomb run we couldn't cut a single one adrift. Not one. And there was no rafts. None. That vessel sank in twelve minutes. Yes, that's all she took. We didn't see the first shark till we'd been in the water about an hour. A thirteen-footer near enough. A blue. You measure that by judgin' the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... of course the Captain knew...I guess some officers knew... was the bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signals was sent. What the men didn't know was that they wouldn't even list us as overdue for a week. Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't an officer -- just as well perhaps. So some of us were dead already -- in the water -- just hangin' limp in our lifejackets. And several already bleedin'. And the three hundred or so laying on the bottom of the ocean. As the light went, the sharks came crusin'. We formed tight groups -- somewhat like squares in an old battle -- You know what I mean -- so that when one come close, the man nearest would yell and shout and pound the water and sometimes it worked and the fish turned away, but other times that shark would seem to look right at a man -- right into his eyes -- and in spite of all shoutin' and poundin' you'd hear that terrible high screamin' and the ocean would go red, then churn up as they ripped him. Then we'd reform our little squares. By the first dawn the sharks had taken more than a hundred. Hard for me to count but more than a hundred. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe a thousand. I do know they averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. In the middle of the second day, some of us started to go crazy from the thirst. One fella cried out he saw a river, another claimed he saw a waterfall, some started to drink the ocean and choked on it, and some left our little groups -- our little squares -- and swam off alone lookin' for islands and the sharks always took them right away. It was mainly the young fellas that did that -- the older ones stayed where they was. That second day -- my life jacket rubbed me raw and that was more blood in the water. Oh my. On Thursday morning I bumped up against a friend of mine -- Herbie Robinson from Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it seemed he was asleep but when I reached over to waken him, he bobbed in the water and I saw his body upend because he'd been bitten in half beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it went on -- bombers high overhead but nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, sharks, and all this goin' crazy and dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung around and came in low. Yes. He did that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And early evenin', a big fat PBY come down out of the sky and began the pickup. That was when I was most frightened of all -- while I was waitin' for my turn. Just two and a half hours short of five days and five nights when they got to me and took me up. Eleven hundred of us went into that ocean -- three hundred and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen hundred and forty five. June the 29th. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
F	BRODY	What the hell?
M	HOOPER	It's a whale out there.
M	QUINT	Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I had a little drink about an hour ago, and it went right to my head.
M	QUINT	Start the engines.
M	QUINT	He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
F	BRODY	Where...?
M	QUINT	The bilge pumps. There --
M	QUINT	Cut the engines!
M	HOOPER	Rudder bearings?
M	QUINT	Get up forward! Watch for him!
M	QUINT	Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!
M	QUINT	Nobody sleeps! Nobody.
M	QUINT	Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
M	QUINT	More left rudder! More! Left hand down now, Chief.
M	HOOPER	Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.
M	QUINT	He's bent the housing. You can hear it.
F	BRODY	The barrel!
M	QUINT	It's him.
M	QUINT	He's under the keg. Careful --
M	QUINT	Easy -- just want to goose him up. The minute he runs, drop it or you'll lose your hands.
M	QUINT	Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's been doin'.
F	BRODY	Shark! Starboard!
M	QUINT	Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us! Start the engine!
M	QUINT	Easy! It'll tear right out!
M	HOOPER	The shaft is giving.
F	BRODY	That's it! Radio in for help!
M	QUINT	Shut up! Just pump her out!
F	BRODY	Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call. Beg your pardon --
M	QUINT	Duty first and pleasure after --
M	QUINT	Excuse me!
F	BRODY	Some great idea! Now where are we? Some goddamn skipper you are. You're certifiable, y'know that? You're a real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!
M	HOOPER	Coming right to us!
M	QUINT	No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- Slower! Throttle back ---
M	QUINT	Hard to port!
M	QUINT	Try shakin' that out!
F	BRODY	Did you get him in the head?
M	QUINT	No! No! No! Swing around! After him!
M	QUINT	More gas... go to half! Get me right alongside him --
M	HOOPER	We can't rev it up this high --
M	QUINT	Watch it!
M	QUINT	Atta boy!
M	QUINT	Take two, they're small!
M	HOOPER	Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
F	BRODY	I can't stand here doing nothing!
M	QUINT	Order in the court!
M	QUINT	Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble with two!
M	QUINT	Grab yourselves a couple of poles!
M	QUINT	Get ready! Now snag 'em!
M	QUINT	Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto the transom -- free ride.
M	QUINT	Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a little reverse for you!
M	QUINT	Haul in -- watch the prop!
M	QUINT	Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us to pieces.
M	QUINT	Damn head is too far away. He's too big.
M	QUINT	He can't go so deep. Not with all those on him.
F	BRODY	What about us?
M	QUINT	Have to pump her steady, s'all.
M	QUINT	Follow him -- You start pumpin' out here.
M	HOOPER (O.S.)	He's heading under -- !
M	QUINT	No way! He can't!
F	BRODY	Where'd he go?
M	QUINT	He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
F	BRODY	Have you ever had one do this?
M	QUINT	No!
M	QUINT	Follow him!
M	HOOPER	He's under!
F	BRODY	There!
F	BRODY	He's trying to sink us!
M	QUINT	Dead astern! Zig-zag!
F	BRODY	He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
M	QUINT	Full throttle! To port!
M	HOOPER	Hold her.
M	HOOPER	Keep him there! Keep him!
M	QUINT	Throttling back!
M	QUINT	What can that gun of yours do?
M	HOOPER	Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
F	BRODY	You gotta go in the water...
M	HOOPER	Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.
M	HOOPER	Take me up.
M	HOOPER	Lower away, Chief. Try and keep him off me till I'm under.
M	QUINT	Let go of it!
M	QUINT	He's comin' up -- !
F	BRODY	He's taken him!
M	HOOPER	Quint...?
F	BRODY	No... You think we can get back with those?
F	BRODY	What day is this?
M	HOOPER	Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
F	BRODY	Think the tide's with us?
M	HOOPER	Just keep kicking.
F	BRODY	Y'know, I used to hate the water...
M	HOOPER	I can't imagine why.
