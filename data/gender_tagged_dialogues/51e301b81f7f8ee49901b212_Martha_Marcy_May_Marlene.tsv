M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	LUCY	Hello. Hello?
F	MARTHA	Hi!
F	LUCY	Martha?
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	Oh my god! Where are you?
F	MARTHA	I'm not sure. Upstate I think.
F	LUCY	You're in New York?
F	MARTHA	I think. Yeah.
F	LUCY	When did you get back? Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?
F	MARTHA	I don't know. I should go back.
F	LUCY	Go back where?
F	MARTHA	I have to go, I can't stay gone.
F	LUCY	No, no, no. Don't go. What are you talking about?
F	MARTHA	Sorry for calling.
F	LUCY	Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not hang up. Do you want me to come get you?
F	MARTHA	I can't wait that long.
F	LUCY	What do you mean? Tell me where you are and I'll come right now.
F	MARTHA	It's okay, you don't have to-
F	LUCY	I want to see you Martha. Please.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Martha! The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Marcy May?
M	WATTS	What are you doin'?
M	WATTS (CONT'D)	We were worried about you.
F	MARTHA	I'm fine.
M	WATTS	Patrick's worried about you.
F	MARTHA	I just wanted to come into town.
M	WATTS	I could've brought you.
F	MARTHA	I wanted to walk.
M	WATTS	Through the woods?
M	WAITRESS	Can I get you something?
M	WATTS	No.
M	WAITRESS	You done?
F	MARTHA	Yeah. The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his
M	WATTS	You not gonna eat that?
M	WATTS (CONT'D)	You ready to go?
M	WATTS (CONT'D)	Come on!
F	MARTHA	Not right now.
M	WATTS	No?
M	WATTS (CONT'D)	I'll get this.
F	LUCY	It's nice to see you.
F	MARTHA	You too.
F	LUCY	What's going on?
F	MARTHA	Not much.
F	LUCY	You alright?
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	You sure?
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	You were pretty upset on the phone.
F	MARTHA	Sorry. I over reacted. To what? What happened?
F	MARTHA	We had a fight.
F	LUCY	Who?
F	MARTHA	Me and this guy.
F	LUCY	Who?
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Your boyfriend? Did he hurt you?
F	MARTHA	No!
F	LUCY	Are you sure?
F	MARTHA	No. I'm fine.
F	LUCY	Did you guys break up?
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	How long were you together?
F	MARTHA	A while.
F	LUCY	How long?
F	MARTHA	I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or less.
F	LUCY	And you were here the whole time?
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me?
F	MARTHA	I'm sorry.
F	LUCY	Well, I'm glad you're here now.
F	LUCY	I made you some tea.
F	MARTHA	Thanks.
F	LUCY	Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner.
F	MARTHA	I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed?
F	LUCY	Of course. Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow. Lucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her
M	TED	Well?
F	LUCY	She seems okay.
M	TED	What did she say?
F	LUCY	Not much, she's pretty tired.
M	TED	Where's she been?
F	LUCY	She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills.
M	TED	What?
F	LUCY	It's okay.
M	TED	Not really Lucy.
F	LUCY	It's fine. She's here now.
M	TED	Well, how long's she staying?
F	LUCY	I don't know.
M	TED	I told you she was fine. You spend all that time worrying.
F	LUCY	Martha? Why are you on the floor?
F	MARTHA	I'm sorry.
F	LUCY	It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come have some breakfast.
M	TED	Martha! Welcome!
F	MARTHA	Hi.
M	TED	Great to finally meet you. You sleep alright?
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	How do you like the house?
M	TED	It's just a rental.
F	LUCY	Well I love it.
F	MARTHA	It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake.
F	LUCY	Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
F	MARTHA	You don't live in the city anymore?
F	LUCY	We do. This is for weekends and holidays.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments. You want to see pictures?
M	TED	Do you think she's excited to have you back?
F	LUCY	This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right? We were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer.
M	TED	Yep, just a little while longer.
F	LUCY	Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Aren't you hungry?
F	MARTHA	Not really, sorry.
M	TED	Well, you've got to eat.
F	LUCY	It's okay, I can fix you something later.
F	MARTHA	Where are we?
F	LUCY	Connecticut.
F	MARTHA	How far are we?
F	LUCY	From what?
F	MARTHA	Yesterday.
F	LUCY	You mean where I picked you up? Martha nods. About 3 hours. Why?
F	MARTHA	Just wondered.
F	ZOE	Put out your cigarette.
F	MARTHA	Why?
F	ZOE	Just do it.
F	MARTHA	Is that him?
F	ZOE	Yeah. Hey!
M	PATRICK	Is this Martha?
F	MARTHA	Hi!
M	PATRICK	How're you doing?
F	MARTHA	Great. You've got a really nice place here.
M	PATRICK	It's as much yours as it is mine.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	I thought you quit?
F	ZOE	I did.
M	PATRICK	It's disgusting.
F	ZOE	I know. I'm sorry.
M	PATRICK	Don't apologize to me, it's your body.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Look after this girl properly Zoe, she deserves some real care for once in her life.
F	ZOE	I will.
F	MARTHA	She's been great, everyone's been great.
M	PATRICK	Good. You look like a Marcy May.
F	MARTHA	Marcy was my grandmothers name.
M	PATRICK	Well, there you go.
M	TED (O.S.)	I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join?
F	MARTHA	Sure. You coming?
M	TED	Brilliant choice of swim wear.
F	LUCY	Martha! What are you doing?
F	MARTHA	What?
F	LUCY	Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked.
F	MARTHA	Why?
F	LUCY	You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.
F	MARTHA	So?
F	LUCY	So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow.
F	LUCY	Martha! I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	You should eat.
F	MARTHA	I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay?
F	LUCY	Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.
F	MARTHA	It's okay.
M	TED	She's not coming?
F	LUCY	She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her.
M	TED	She seems a bit off, no?
F	LUCY	She's just really tired. She's had a bad breakup. I want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know?
M	TED	Has she always been like this?
F	LUCY	A pain in my ass, yes.
M	MAX	Hey Marcy.
F	MARTHA	Hey Max. Where do they go at night?
M	MAX	I don't know, I never get invited.
M	MAX (CONT'D)	You want to have a drink with me?
M	MAX (CONT'D)	They won't be back for a few hours.
F	MARTHA	I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.
M	MAX	Alright.
F	MARTHA	Patrick'll know.
M	MAX	It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.
F	KATIE	We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things. Do you knit?
F	MARTHA	No. I can learn though.
F	KATIE	It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.
M	KATIE (CONT'D)	We sell blankets in town. We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again.
F	MARTHA	When do you think that'll happen?
F	KATIE	Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash.
F	MARTHA	That'll be nice.
F	KATIE	Shoot.
M	PATRICK	How's everything going so far Marcy May?
F	MARTHA	Good.
M	PATRICK	You like it here?
F	MARTHA	Yeah, it's really nice.
M	PATRICK	I want you to feel at home.
F	MARTHA	I do. Thanks.
M	PATRICK	People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone.
F	MARTHA	What?
M	PATRICK	If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	It's not your fault, but it's there. If you feel safe here, and I think you do, let us in. We just want to help you.
F	ZOE	Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.
M	PATRICK	If you're going to live here then really be apart of things.
F	LUCY	Good morning. How are you feeling today?
F	MARTHA	Good.
F	LUCY	There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices. This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	I got pineapple orange too if that's better.
F	MARTHA	Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
F	LUCY	I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack.
F	MARTHA	Why is the house so big?
F	LUCY	It's not that big.
F	MARTHA	For two people, it's huge.
F	LUCY	We like to entertain. Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties. It's just good to have space.
F	MARTHA	So no one else lives here?
F	LUCY	Of course no one else lives here.
F	MARTHA	You're married?
F	LUCY	Yeah.
F	MARTHA	When?
F	LUCY	Earlier this year, in the spring.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	I tried to get in touch with you, apparently you got rid of your cell phone?
F	MARTHA	I lost it.
F	LUCY	You never got a new one?
F	MARTHA	I got used to not having it.
M	TED	Cocktail anyone?
F	LUCY	No thanks.
M	TED	Martha?
F	MARTHA	Was it a big wedding?
F	LUCY	No, about forty people. Mostly his family.
F	MARTHA	Did Aunt Dora come?
F	LUCY	Yeah.
F	MARTHA	Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything. Ted laughs.
F	LUCY	She's not that bad.
F	MARTHA	You never had to live with her.
M	TED	You lived with Dora?
F	MARTHA	She lived with me after mom died.
M	TED	Where were you?
F	LUCY	College.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay.
F	MARTHA	She hates me.
F	LUCY	She doesn't hate you. Look at me.
F	MARTHA	I hate her.
F	LUCY	Relax, I don't have any pictures of you. Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	There you go! Don't shake it, that's a myth.
F	MARTHA	Is it true married people don't fuck?
F	LUCY	What? No!
F	LUCY	Put this on.
F	MARTHA	You're kidding.
F	LUCY	Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it.
F	MARTHA	Why does it matter?
F	LUCY	It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	It looks good you little shit.
F	MARTHA	Whatever makes you happy mama bear.
F	LUCY	You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good.
F	LUCY	It's no good?
M	TED	It's good, it's just, a bit dry.
F	LUCY	It's not dry.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	It just needs a little salt. What are you laughing about I cooked for you your whole life.
F	MARTHA	You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks.
M	TED	She seems better today.
F	LUCY	Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go tomorrow.
M	TED	Let me take you.
F	LUCY	No, I don't want to leave her alone. You'll be nice to her right?
M	TED	I'm always nice.
F	LUCY	Right.
F	KATIE	I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us. Do you believe me?
F	ZOE	You're so lucky, I'd give anything to have my first time again.
F	MARTHA	Really?
F	ZOE	Yeah, it's so special.
F	MARTHA	I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -
F	ZOE	That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins. You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish.
F	MARTHA	I'm not.
F	ZOE	So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once.
M	PATRICK	This one's called Marcy's song. Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Well she, she's just a picture. Who lives on my wall Well she, she's just a picture And the reason, reason, reason it is so small. With a smile so inviting and a body so tall, She, she's just a picture Just a picture THAT'S ALL the nightshade, Her dripping ripping down your hands And you ask me, ask me about the LIGHTNING And the lady, lady, lady she understands It's a dream for the future and the water for the sands And the strangeness is wandering Through
M	TED	What are you doing?
F	MARTHA	Cleaning. I thought I'd help out more.
M	TED	Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come?
F	MARTHA	Is Lucy coming?
M	TED	She had to run to the city.
F	MARTHA	Oh.
M	TED	I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on.
F	MARTHA	It's okay.
M	TED	Come on.
M	TED	You want one?
M	TED (CONT'D)	Beautiful day.
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
M	TED	How have things been with you and Lucy?
F	MARTHA	Fine.
M	TED	Is it strange to spend time together?
F	MARTHA	No. Why?
M	TED	It's been a long time.
F	MARTHA	I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	Where is she?
M	TED	At the doctor.
F	MARTHA	Why?
M	TED	She's getting a check up. We're trying to have a baby.
M	TED (CONT'D)	What?
F	MARTHA	I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.
M	TED	Why?
F	MARTHA	She wouldn't know what to do with it. Do you want a baby?
M	TED	I want what Lucy wants. If she's happy, I'm happy. So you're unhappy!
M	TED	No. She's good. She's relieved to have you back. You had her worried.
F	MARTHA	Why?
M	TED	You disappeared. You haven't called in two years!
F	MARTHA	I lost track I guess.
M	TED	It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry.
F	MARTHA	I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
M	TED	Well, she did.
F	MARTHA	Can I go swimming?
M	TED	You don't need to ask. Martha watches as Watts jumps off the cliff into the water.
M	PATRICK	You jump yet?
F	MARTHA	No.
M	PATRICK	Go on.
M	WATTS	You ready?
F	MARTHA	I can't.
M	WATTS	Sure you can.
F	LUCY	What? What? Martha, what are you doing?
F	MARTHA	Nothing!
F	LUCY	Jesus, you can't just come in like that.
F	MARTHA	Sorry.
F	LUCY	God damn it, what's wrong?
F	MARTHA	It's been hard to sleep alone.
M	TED	All you do is sleep. Martha goes to leave again.
F	LUCY	Stay, just stay.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Why would you think it was okay to come in like that?
F	MARTHA	I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side.
F	LUCY	You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's private.
F	MARTHA	Sorry.
F	LUCY	Don't apologize, I just want you to understand why it's not okay.
F	MARTHA	Okay.
F	LUCY	Do you?
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	Well?
F	MARTHA	Because it's privte and it's not normal.
F	LUCY	Just lie down Martha.
M	TED	This is just brilliant.
F	LUCY	I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient.
M	TED	I don't have much choice do I?
F	LUCY	I just want to make sure she's okay.
M	TED	I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work!
F	LUCY	I know.
M	TED	I am under so much pressure right now-
F	LUCY	I know you are.
M	TED	I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.
F	LUCY	That has nothing to do with Martha. My point is, I don't need the extra stress.
F	LUCY	I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now. It's complicated Ted.
M	TED	As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane.
F	MARTHA	Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?
F	LUCY	No. Maybe it's the pine cones. Where did you pick up gardening?
F	MARTHA	We had a garden where I lived?
F	LUCY	You're good.
F	MARTHA	I'm good at some things.
F	LUCY	I know you are.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Was he ever physical with you?
F	MARTHA	Who?
F	LUCY	Your boyfriend. What do you mean?
F	LUCY	Did he ever, hit you?
F	MARTHA	No.
F	LUCY	You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical. Are you sure?
F	MARTHA	Yes.
F	LUCY	You can tell me.
F	MARTHA	He never hit me.
F	LUCY	I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
F	MARTHA	I do.
F	LUCY	So talk.
F	MARTHA	There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big DEAL
F	KATIE	Don't stare!
F	MARTHA	You okay?
F	ZOE	Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so weak.
F	MARTHA	You're not. You'll quit.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	Who's that?
F	KATIE	Her name's Sarah I think. You should handle her.
F	MARTHA	You think?
F	KATIE	You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be great.
F	MARTHA	Whose car was that?
F	LUCY	I don't know. Why?
F	MARTHA	Just curious.
F	LUCY	There's a hiking trail, people leave their cars there all the time.
F	LUCY	Sorry.
M	YOUNG MAN	It's okay.
F	LUCY	You're going to hurt someone.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Can you go get me a large jug of water.
F	MARTHA	What's wrong with the tap?
F	LUCY	I like bottled.
F	MARTHA	It's a waste.
F	LUCY	Will you get it or not?
F	MARTHA	Did you know that guy?
F	LUCY	What guy?
F	MARTHA	The guy in the store.
F	LUCY	The one you almost ran into? No.
F	MARTHA	He was looking at me like he knew me. Did you say something to him?
F	LUCY	Like what?
F	MARTHA	I don't know, you tell me.
F	LUCY	What are you talking about?
F	MARTHA	He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me?
F	LUCY	No. Jesus. The guy was checking you out Martha! Relax. If you don't want guys to drool all over you, then wear more clothes-
F	MARTHA	Just drive the car Lucy.
F	LUCY	What?
F	MARTHA	Drive the car!
F	LUCY	I don't think we should have the party.
M	TED	It's labor day, we always have it.
F	LUCY	Things are just too stressful right now.
M	TED	I've already invited clients.
F	LUCY	I'm sure people would understand-
M	TED	They wouldn't.
F	LUCY	I just think it would be best.
M	TED	For who, Martha?
F	LUCY	For all of us.
M	TED	It's not an option! We're having the party.
F	LUCY	And that's the end of it, because you say so.
M	TED	Yes!
F	MARTHA	We share all of this, if it fits, you can wear it.
F	SARAH	Cool.
F	MARTHA	This is where we sleep. You can take any bed that's open or you can sleep downstairs.
F	SARAH	I'm hungry, can we eat?
F	MARTHA	We don't eat until the evening.
F	SARAH	Really?
F	MARTHA	You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't need that much food. You're taught to overconsume.
F	SARAH	He's beautiful. Whose the mother?
F	MARTHA	Katie's, but we all help out.
F	SARAH	Is Patrick the father?
F	MARTHA	Uh huh.
F	SARAH	They look just like him. All the kids here are boys?
F	MARTHA	He only has boys.
F	SARAH	You're good with them.
F	MARTHA	You want to hold him?
F	SARAH	No Thanks. I don't have to take care of them do I?
F	MARTHA	Not if you don't want to. There are plenty of jobs to be done. You'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.
F	ZOE	I called my dad today to ask for money.
F	MARTHA	Does Patrick know?
F	ZOE	He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's something we really need I'll call.
F	MARTHA	How was it?
F	ZOE	Fine, they're not bad people.
F	MARTHA	Did he give you the money?
F	ZOE	Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.
F	MARTHA	Do you tell him you're not?
F	ZOE	No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess he'd rather pay for it than think I'm sucking dick for it.
F	SARAH	I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried everything pretty much, except heroin.
F	ZOE	It's good to try everything at least once. You find out who you are that way. What about drinking, do you drink?
F	SARAH	I have, but I don't.
F	ZOE	Good, we don't drink. It just makes you angry and less focused.
F	MARTHA	Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't talk to our old families.
F	SARAH	I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter how much he paid me.
M	PATRICK	Hey.
F	MARTHA	Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet?
M	PATRICK	Sally, yeah.
F	KATIE	That's enough.
M	KATIE (CONT'D)	Half is fine.
F	LUCY	I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
F	MARTHA	I don't mind.
F	LUCY	Get some sleep.
F	MARTHA	Okay.
F	MARTHA	Oh, hi.
F	SARAH	Hi.
M	SARAH (CONT'D)	What do I have to do?
F	MARTHA	Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	It's herbal. It's the start of your cleansing.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about.
F	SARAH	Do I have to wear this robe?
F	MARTHA	I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	You look amazing. It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.
F	SARAH	Thanks.
F	MARTHA	Shouldn't we start cooking?
F	LUCY	I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish.
F	MARTHA	I thought we were going to cook.
F	LUCY	We cooked last night.
F	MARTHA	Oh, yeah.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed?
F	LUCY	Not really.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Do you blame me for anything?
F	MARTHA	No. Like what?
F	LUCY	I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking.
F	MARTHA	I didn't think about it.
F	LUCY	Really?
F	MARTHA	We were far apart.
F	LUCY	Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you.
F	MARTHA	The past doesn't matter.
F	LUCY	It does matter.
F	MARTHA	I took care of myself.
F	LUCY	I know you did. I think I could have done more though.
F	MARTHA	Stop it.
F	LUCY	Be honest with me, you never think about it?
F	MARTHA	No.
F	LUCY	You're not angry at me?
F	MARTHA	I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.
F	LUCY	No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential.
F	MARTHA	I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am.
F	LUCY	Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	MARTHA-
F	MARTHA	Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head. Dinner's ready.
M	TED	So what are your plans Martha?
F	MARTHA	For what?
M	TED	Life.
F	MARTHA	I don't know.
M	TED	Are you thinking about what you can do for work?
F	MARTHA	No. You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career.
F	MARTHA	Why?
M	TED	It's a part of adult life.
F	MARTHA	There are other ways to live.
M	TED	Really?
F	MARTHA	Sure.
M	TED	Like what?
F	MARTHA	I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist.
F	LUCY	He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together.
M	TED	I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way.
F	MARTHA	You can do that if you want to.
M	TED	It's not that simple.
F	MARTHA	It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live. Lucy is floored by Martha's response.
M	TED	And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude.
F	MARTHA	You don't know anything about it.
M	WOMAN	Hello...Hello.
F	MARTHA	Who's this?
M	WOMAN	Who's this? Zoe?
F	MARTHA	She not there?
M	WOMAN	She's not.
F	MARTHA	Where is she?
M	WOMAN	Who is this?
F	MARTHA	Who is this?
M	WOMAN	It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this. Martha hangs up. The phone rings. She unplugs the phone
M	MAX	Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but I think you're hopeless.
F	ZOE	I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it.
M	MAX	Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday.
M	MAX (CONT'D)	God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes my willy hard.
F	ZOE	What happened Doc? I should be teaching you.
F	MARTHA	Alright, my turn. Alright Max, was this just an excuse to grope Marcy.
M	MAX	I'm teaching her how to shoot. Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze.
M	PATRICK	Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel how they made you feel in your stomach. Take a deep breath, feel it all moving out into your hands. Let it build. It's transferring to the gun, building in the gun. Now release.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Feels good right?
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Now try that.
F	MARTHA	What do you mean?
M	PATRICK	Shoot it.
F	MARTHA	They're living animals.
M	PATRICK	So, shoot Max then.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Go on!
M	MAX	Fuck this.
M	PATRICK	Don't walk away from me Max.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	The cat has terminal cancer, it's in excruciating pain.
F	MARTHA	I can't.
M	PATRICK	Max has no substance, he's just here to free load and be around the girls but you're a teacher and leader, you just don't see it because no one let you believe it before me. You're a leader a Marcy, now prove it.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love. You're holding on to some false emotion that stops you from doing what's right.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	I could spend my life being selfish, living alone, using this gift for me but I've sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be. You need to trust me.
F	MARTHA	I trust you.
M	PATRICK	everything. What did you do?
M	MAX	You said it was sick.
M	PATRICK	One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one it was!
F	MARTHA	You okay?
M	MAX	I'm fine. I'll probably leave this place soon anyways.
F	MARTHA	Where are you going to go?
M	MAX	I got places. My cousin lives in Bennington, he said I could go up there and make like, $500 a week selling weed.
F	MARTHA	You don't want to do that.
M	MAX	I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all these rules.
F	MARTHA	Max, they're not rules. It's just common sense.
M	MAX	It feels like rules. They won't let me do anything. I can't even go on the house runs. I'd be great at taking shit.
F	MARTHA	It's not about taking shit.
M	MAX	Sounds like it's about taking shit to me. And that's why you don't get to come. You just don't get it. You need to quit drinking.
M	MAX	I'm not drinking.
F	MARTHA	You're still living with all the shit you carried out there. You're the only one, let it go.
M	MAX	I'll try.
F	MARTHA	No. You can't try. You have to stop. They love you, they just want you to be stronger.
M	MAX	I'm strong, they'll see.
F	MARTHA	You'll be okay. The man in the house comes out of his front door, walks
M	TED	Jesus Christ you scared me.
F	MARTHA	Sorry.
M	TED	Did I wake you?
F	MARTHA	No. I can't sleep.
M	TED	Me neither. I was going to watch a movie. You want to watch?
F	MARTHA	I should try to sleep.
M	TED	It always helps me. It's better than lying in bed awake.
M	TED	I'm sorry about before, Martha.
F	MARTHA	It's alright. It's your house.
M	TED	You want me to make some breakfast?
M	TED (CONT'D)	Hey!
M	TED	What's wrong?
F	LUCY	You can not be serious right now.
M	TED	What?
M	TED (CONT'D)	Lucy!
F	LUCY	One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch?
M	TED	No one was curling up with anybody.
F	LUCY	You really do think I'm stupid don't you?
M	TED	Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave?
M	TED (CONT'D)	You're being ridiculous.
F	LUCY	You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason.
M	TED	Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds.
F	LUCY	Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel.
M	TED	You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win.
F	LUCY	You're unbelievable.
M	Ted runs.	
F	MARTHA	You shouldn't smoke.
F	LUCY	What? I don't smoke.
F	MARTHA	Especially if you're trying to have a kid.
F	LUCY	Maybe you should mind your own business.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	I can't deal with talking to anyone right now.
F	MARTHA	What's you name?
M	BARTENDER	I'm sorry? What's your name?
M	BARTENDER	Mike. Can I get you something?
F	MARTHA	I used to like this.
M	BARTENDER	Straight?
F	MARTHA	I thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike.
M	BARTENDER	I'm not drinking.
F	MARTHA	You think you're so fucking smart.
F	LUCY	Hey, what happenind?
F	MARTHA	We all need to leave.
F	LUCY	What?
F	MARTHA	He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave.
F	LUCY	What are you talking about?
F	MARTHA	We have to leave. We all have to leave. I know him.
F	LUCY	Who? What the fuck is wrong with you?
F	MARTHA	You don't want to live with this Lucy.
F	LUCY	Martha.
M	TED	Calm down.
F	LUCY	What are you talking about?
F	MARTHA	They're here.
F	LUCY	Breath.
F	MARTHA	Don't touch me, you're not listening to me!
F	LUCY	Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about.
M	MAN	What the fuck.
M	WATTS	Hey, we can go.
M	MAN	What do you want?
M	WATTS	Nothing.
M	WATTS (CONT'D)	No need for that, we are leaving.
M	PATRICK	Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt.
M	MAN	What do you want?
M	PATRICK	We're not stealing, we don't want anything.
M	MAN	Just get out.
M	PATRICK	We're just looking at the house. It's nice. We didn't realize you were home. We wouldn't have come in otherwise.
M	MAN	Just Leave.
M	PATRICK	I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police.
M	MAN	I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe.
M	PATRICK	Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine.
M	MAN	Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go.
M	MAN (CONT'D)	Get the fuck out of my house.
M	PATRICK	Look at me.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	You okay?
F	MARTHA	Uh huh.
M	PATRICK	You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.
F	LUCY	It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.
F	MARTHA	Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
F	LUCY	Everything was fine.
F	MARTHA	Is it over?
F	LUCY	Yes, you slept through the night.
F	MARTHA	That's good.
F	LUCY	Are you going to drink the tea?
F	MARTHA	I don't want it.
F	MARTHA	We have to do something.
M	WATTS	He's fine. Right Max?
M	MAX	Yeah, I'm cool.
F	MARTHA	Watts! There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right?
M	MAX	Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.
F	MARTHA	How long do you think we'll be down here?
F	ZOE	It'll just be a few days. Just to be safe.
F	MARTHA	Do you feel alright? If you hit your head you shouldn't sleep.
M	MAX	I'm fine.
F	MARTHA	Do you know why we're down here?
M	MAX	No. Do you?
F	MARTHA	What do you think it was?
M	MAX	I don't know. It doesn't matter.
F	MARTHA	Do you still think about leaving?
M	MAX	No. It's cool now, I don't really have anywhere to go. Why, would you?
F	MARTHA	No. I just wanted to see about you.
F	MARTHA	Hello?
M	VOICE	Hi, is Watts there?
F	MARTHA	Who's this?
M	VOICE	Jane. Is Watts there?
F	MARTHA	Can I help you?
M	VOICE	Who's this? It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name Jane.
M	VOICE	Heller, sorry, do I have the right number?
F	MARTHA	I don't know, do you?
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	It's a Jane.
M	WATTS	Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do it, I'll be around there on Friday. No, that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad you called.
M	WATTS (CONT'D)	Hey.
F	KATIE	Nothing till they're done. You know better.
F	MARTHA	I know. Sorry Katie.
M	LUCY (O.S.)	Who's Katie?
F	MARTHA	What?
F	LUCY	Who's Katie?
F	MARTHA	Oh, nothing.
M	MARTHA (CONT'D)	Lucy?
F	LUCY	Yeah.
F	MARTHA	Is this from the past or is this now?
F	LUCY	What?
F	MARTHA	I don't remember waking up this morning.
F	LUCY	Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up.
M	TED	What's going on?
F	LUCY	Who the fuck knows.
M	TED	She needs to see someone.
F	LUCY	I know.
M	TED	I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday.
F	LUCY	Places?
M	TED	I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this.
F	LUCY	I don't want to talk about it anymore.
F	MARTHA	Zoe?
F	ZOE	Yeah.
F	MARTHA	I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.
F	ZOE	I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past. Someone knocks at the door. She pretends not to be in
F	ZOE	Martha, it's me, can I come in?
M	PATRICK	Haven't you learned anything?
F	MARTHA	I have.
M	PATRICK	I felt like we had a connection.
F	MARTHA	We do!
M	PATRICK	That's not what you're showing me.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Maybe I asked too much from you too soon. You have potential but you're just not there yet. I'll expect less of you fro now on.
F	MARTHA	I'm sorry.
M	PATRICK	Shhh. It's okay.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	You're my favorite, I won't lose you.
F	LUCY	Are you alright?
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	What the fuck happened?
M	TED	She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.
F	LUCY	You could have killed him.
F	MARTHA	I was confused.
F	LUCY	About what, what are you so confused about?
F	MARTHA	I thought he was someone else.
M	Lucy's anger is building.	You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you? I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on.
F	MARTHA	I'm sorry.
F	LUCY	You need help Martha.
F	MARTHA	I know.
F	LUCY	What happened to you? What happened to you?
F	MARTHA	I don't know.
F	LUCY	We're going to get you proper help.
F	MARTHA	Are you going to send me away?
F	LUCY	I don't know how to help you anymore.
F	MARTHA	Please don't. Please don't.
F	LUCY	I can't help you.
F	MARTHA	Please, I can't be alone, please.
F	LUCY	We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here.
F	MARTHA	Lucy?
F	LUCY	What?
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	What?
F	MARTHA	You're going to be a terrible mother.
F	LUCY	Do you have any money left?
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Of course you don't. We'll make sure everything is taken care of.
F	LUCY	Going swimming?
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	It's a bit chilly.
F	MARTHA	I don't mind.
F	LUCY	I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.
F	MARTHA	Yeah.
F	LUCY	We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning.
F	MARTHA	What's it like there?
F	LUCY	It looks nice.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	We're heading back to the city in about an hour. You'll be ready to go?
F	MARTHA	Yep. Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water
M	TED	Jesus Christ.
F	LUCY	Are you okay?
M	TED	Yeah.
F	LUCY	Fucking idiot. What was he doing? She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying
