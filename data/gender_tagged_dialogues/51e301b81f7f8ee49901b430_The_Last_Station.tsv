M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	SOFYA	Why are we slowing down?
F	SOFYA	We're stopping. Why are we stopping?
F	SASHA	I don't know, mother. No idea.
F	SOFYA	Excuse me, why has the train stopped?
M	CONDUCTOR	It's the crowd, ma'm, the people. They're blocking the track.
M	VOICES (O.S.)	Long live Tolstoy! Long live the old warrior!
F	SOFYA	But if they block the track, the train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM MOVE.
F	SOFYA	Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here.
M	TOLSTOY	I have seen your banner. And I´ve heard what you say. You think I´m the hope of Russia, do you? Well, that´s not true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say, you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his.
M	VALENTIN	Do you know who that is? That is the greatest man in the world.
F	SOFYA	Darling.
M	CHERTKOV	But sex... You are twenty three. Not an easy age for abstinence, is it?
M	VALENTIN	Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations. I know this.
M	CHERTKOV	He despises them, in fact...
M	CHERTKOV	I don't want to belabor the point, but I arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that. He was very upset.
M	VALENTIN	This would not be a problem. I'm celibate. I'm also a strict vegetarian.
M	CHERTKOV	Yes, I've heard many good things about you. I've even read what you`ve written. So has he.
M	CHERTKOV	My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side.
M	VALENTIN	Believe me, since becoming a Tolstoyan, I have become so eager to learn, so comitted to discussing ideas, improving my very soul.
M	CHERTKOV	Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people.
M	VALENTIN	We?
M	CHERTKOV	Yes, we. If we can encourage the spread of passive resistance...just think of it Valentin thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression-
M	VALENTIN	In the name of truth and freedom.
M	CHERTKOV	Truth and freedom, yes but still, my boy, there are so many enemies-
M	VALENTIN	Enemies?
M	CHERTKOV	The Czar's police...You'll be followed when you leave here...and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold. His children can't be trusted... only Sasha... and then of course there is the Countess... Well, one doesn't like to come between married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to private property, her public criticism of our movement... The point is, he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him. Someone who can help him with the new work. Someone who understands his goals.
M	CHERTKOV	And although they've allowed me to return to Russia, I can't see him. They keep me under house arrest... They might as well keep me in a cage.
M	CHERTKOV	So, I need you to put these letters directly into his hands. One can't be sure what gets through to him.
M	CHERTKOV	Sofya Andreyevna does not respect his privacy.
M	VALENTIN	She wouldn't open his private correspondence...
M	CHERTKOV	I have another task for you, my dear.
M	VALENTIN	Please.
M	CHERTKOV	You'll keep a diary for me.
M	CHERTKOV	I need to know everything that goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let me know who visits the house, any talk of the copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come and go. Anything Sofya Andreyevna says.
M	VALENTIN	Anything?
M	CHERTKOV	She's very, very dangerous.
M	CHERTKOV	Godspeed, my boy.
M	CHERTKOV	And remember what I said.
M	CHERTKOV	Write everything down! Go!
M	TOLSTOY	Nothing's working... Hand me my other boot, my friend, will you?
M	DUSHAN	Let me finish.
M	TOLSTOY	It doesn't matter. If my heart had stopped beating, I'd still go riding today.
M	DUSHAN	Your pulse is my and if you must ride, I insist you wear a coat. Even the sun is cold today.
F	SOFYA	This is impossible! It really is! These people are parasites! Look... "Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband. They barely speak."
F	SOFYA	You know who spreads all this rubbish....
F	SOFYA	C'est la meme en France. They gossip about us in Paris... "They do not share a similar view of either religion or politics." Incroyable!
M	TOLSTOY	Peut-etre. You think that's inaccurate?
F	SOFYA	I think it's none of the world's business.
F	SOFYA	What are you doing? Don't do that.
M	TOLSTOY	Dushan Petrovich, you're scribbling again?
F	SOFYA	Darling, where are you going?
M	TOLSTOY	Riding with Sasha. Don't expect us for lunch.
F	SOFYA	Leovochka, why do you insist on dressing like that.
M	TOLSTOY	What do you mean?
F	SOFYA	Like the man who looks after the sheep.
M	TOLSTOY	It's not meant to offend you.
F	SOFYA	But it does offend me, because it offends reason. You're a Count, for God's sake.
F	SOFYA	Oh darling, I have something else to say.
M	TOLSTOY (O.S.)	I doubt it not, my dear.
M	DUSHAN	He's forgotten his coat.
M	DUSHAN (O.S.)	Count Tolstoy, you've forgotten your coat.
M	DUSHAN	Let him walk. Let him walk.
M	JOURNALIST	Count Tolstoy, you're no doubt distressed by the Czar's treatment of your secretary Nikolai Gusev ?
M	TOLSTOY	These people are bandits.
M	DUSHAN	I said, let him walk.
M	TOLSTOY	They come into my house and arrest a man whose only crime is to express a view of life saner than that which prevails.
M	JOURNALIST	So Gusev is innocent?
M	TOLSTOY	Of course, I'm the guilty one. I reject the Orthodox church. I condemn the established order and I make no secret of it.
M	PEASANT	God bless you, Tolstoy. Thank you.
M	DUSHAN	Let him walk. Let him walk. But you don't banish these people very much to your credit...I wish I had your largeness of spirit.
F	SASHA	Papa.
M	TOLSTOY	Sasha!
F	SASHA	Did you ride this morning?
M	SERGEYENKO	Telyatinki was created by Vladimir Grigorevich as a center for the movement. Just last week we had a visitor from India. We talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum.
M	VALENTIN	Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful day.
M	SERGEYENKO	Yes, but we will pay for it.
M	SERGEYENKO	The meeting room is behind us. This is the tool shed. The dormitory ahead.
M	SERGEYENKO	Telyatinki is a place of freedom. Nothing is forbidden here.
M	SERGEYENKO	Each man is alone with his conscience and his God. The kitchen is below. You'll be expected to assist with meals at least twice a week ...and to give a hand in the garden. We're all equals here, you know...as Tolstoy teaches us.
M	You are expected at Yasnaya	Polyana in the morning, first thing.
M	VALENTIN	I look forward to it.
M	SERGEYENKO	Yes... you're lucky....We're all envious.
M	SERGEYENKO	Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious that you begin your reports as soon as possible. You have the notebook he gave you?
M	VALENTIN	Of course.
M	SERGEYENKO	You understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret.
M	SERGEYENKO	What is it?
M	VALENTIN	Just that...secrecy doesn't seem to me the essence of Tolstoy's thought.
M	SERGEYENKO	But you'll admit, you're no expert.
M	VALENTIN	Yes, I...I'll see you in the morning.
M	SERGEYENKO	If we're spared.
M	VALENTIN	Come in.
F	MASHA	I've brought you a glass of tea.
M	VALENTIN	That's very kind of you.
F	MASHA	It's your first day. Enjoy it.
F	MASHA	You met Sergeyenko?
M	VALENTIN	Last night.
F	MASHA	Ad what do you think?
M	VALENTIN	He seems very sincere.
M	VALENTIN	Thank you. Why are you laughing?
F	MASHA	Say that again.
M	VALENTIN	I said he seems very... Why?
F	MASHA	Is that what you think?
M	VALENTIN	I just arrived...What's your name?
F	MASHA	Masha. But you should still say what you think. Not just about him. We all should.
M	VALENTIN	Thank you for the tea.
F	MASHA	Tomorrow you can make your own.
F	MASHA	He's a sorry old tight-assed stick in the mud...but yes, he's sincere.
M	VALENTIN	Hello...hello...
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You're the new secretary.
F	SASHA	Papa's out. You can wait in the library. Ivan will show you up.
M	TOLSTOY	I'm glad you're here. So glad.
M	VALENTIN	I'm... I'm... Here is-
M	TOLSTOY	God bless you.
M	VALENTIN	I'm sorry. Sometimes I...
M	TOLSTOY	Vladimir Grigorevich has already written about you at length. I need your help badly. The manifesto against the government is hard work. They commit their idiotic abuses faster than I can catalogue them...and the new book...
M	VALENTIN	He told me about it...It's very exciting.
M	TOLSTOY	I've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is? Love! Love! Simple... Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was your journey? Come, sit down.
M	TOLSTOY	You know, I was born on this sofa...
M	TOLSTOY	Sit. Sit.
M	TOLSTOY	Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here. Now, I've read your essays. How`s your work progressing?
M	TOLSTOY	My boy, what is it? I upset you in some way. Was it the sofa? It's only a sofa.
M	VALENTIN	I'm very happy. You are very kind. I'm no one and you are... you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work.
M	TOLSTOY	You rest for a moment and I'll fetch you a glass of tea. Rest, because there's work for both of us together.
F	SOFYA	These people have nothing. It really is the most extraordinary thing.
F	SOFYA	It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much.
M	TOLSTOY	I'm not suggesting they be given land. Private property is the root of the problem... We should be giving ours away.
M	ANDREY	Give it to whom?
F	SOFYA	It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior.
M	TOLSTOY	I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes I do.
M	VALENTIN	It's a keystone of the movement.
F	SOFYA	Oh, I know all about the movement.
M	TOLSTOY	If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month.
F	SOFYA	No, they'd spend it on drink and whores.
M	TOLSTOY	Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot?
M	DUSHAN	Oh, that's good...that's good.
M	VALENTIN	
F	SOFYA	Stop scribbling! You all think he's Christ, don't you? He thinks he's Christ.
M	DUSHAN	I'm not...I don't believe Leo Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is Christ but...
F	SOFYA	But what?
M	DUSHAN	I believe he's one of the prophets. God speaks through him. I recognize the cadence in his voice.
F	SOFYA	This is unbearable. No wonder I feel lonely. I'm surrounded by morrons.
F	SASHA	Mama, you're being ridiculous.
F	SOFYA	Am I? I sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have.
M	TOLSTOY	You keep going on like that...Why do you think we should profit from the work I´m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people.
F	SOFYA	STOP IT! STOP WRITING NOW!
M	DUSHAN	In defense of my gift, let me demonstrate. It's quite remarkable, really.
M	VALENTIN	It's your voice. It's wonderful.
M	TOLSTOY	It's tiresome. Another remarkable invention will supercede it.
M	TOLSTOY	Please excuse me.
M	DUSHAN	Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite, I fear.
M	TOLSTOY	Oh, that´s better. That´s nice. Very nice indeed.
M	VALENTIN (O.S.)	Do your parents often speak to each other so...bluntly?
F	SASHA	My mother doesn't understand my father's goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary. His commitment to the spiritual life offends her. They've fought about it for years.
M	VALENTIN	I'm sure she means well.
M	VALENTIN	Your father is the greatest writer in the world.
F	SASHA	Quite.
M	VALENTIN	I mean to say, I feel privileged to be here. It's an... honor.
F	SASHA	God Bless You.
F	SASHA	God bless you.
M	VALENTIN	I'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze when I'm nervous.
F	SASHA	What is it?
M	IVAN	It´s a note, for him.
F	SASHA	Well, give it to him then.
M	VALENTIN	It´s from your mother. She wants to see me.
F	SASHA	She is looking for allies. Pay attention. This is war.
F	SOFYA	I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes. Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way.
M	VALENTIN	Thank you, Countess...
F	SOFYA	Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed. Many young men ruin their looks by loose living. You're a real Tolstoyan, I can tell!
M	VALENTIN	I admire your husband immensely.
F	SOFYA	That's excellent. He likes that.
M	VALENTIN	His ideas are beautiful...social justice...the idea...Don't you think?
F	SOFYA	He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus.
F	SOFYA	He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy, so I could read all the details...
M	VALENTIN	Thank you.
F	SOFYA	You've read War and Peace?
M	VALENTIN	Many times... twice.
F	SOFYA	When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this "new religion" and revolutionary nonsense... What do you think of Chertkov, by the way?
M	VALENTIN	He's given me an extraordinary opportunity.
F	SOFYA	But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot. I have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house.
F	SOFYA	When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. "Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too simple here. He's not stupid."
F	SOFYA	But I don't count anymore.
F	SOFYA	You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. Do you know I was the only person. I could understand his intention.
M	VALENTIN	I don't believe anyone wants to do that.
F	SOFYA	I have a little gift for you
F	SOFYA	It's a diary. Everyone should always keep a diary.
M	VALENTIN	It's a very popular activity around your husband.
F	SOFYA	You're teasing me, but I trust you'll write the truth.
M	VALENTIN	That may not be so easy.
F	SOFYA	Nonsense. You've been listening to your friends at Telyatinki... Write what you see. That's always the place to begin. What. You. See.
F	SOFYA	More tea?
F	MASHA	You're finished for the day?
M	VALENTIN	He didn't need me this afternoon.
M	VALENTIN	Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of women doing physical labor. Don't you find that reactionary?
F	MASHA	No, I find it sweet. I find you reactionary.
F	MASHA	He admires you, I believe.
F	MASHA	Sergeyenko told me. He's miserable about it.
M	VALENTIN	Tolstoy's kind to everyone.
F	MASHA	What do you talk about when you're with him? Why are you blushing?
M	VALENTIN	We talk about me.
F	MASHA	Really.
M	VALENTIN	He wants to know everything about me, my parents, my relations with women, my experience of god -
F	MASHA	And what relations are these?
F	MASHA	I had a lover before I came here... headmaster of a school where I taught. He was married - happily married. It was difficult. We could make love only at school.
M	VALENTIN	At school?
F	MASHA	In the gymnasium, after the girls had gone. There were straw mats on the floor.
M	VALENTIN	I see...
F	MASHA	Have I upset you?
M	VALENTIN	No...I appreciate your frankness
F	MASHA	But you disapprove of me. I see it in your eyes.
M	VALENTIN	I don't. Not at all...I think sexual activity...how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral.
F	MASHA	Listen to you. You're a prig. Just like Sergeyenko. Why else would they have hired you?
M	VALENTIN	That's not fair
F	MASHA	I don't care if it's fair. It's true...neutral...my God...
M	VALENTIN	I'm going.
F	MASHA	Do as you like.
F	MASHA	Valentin Fedorovich.
F	MASHA	You forgot your horse.
M	VALENTIN	Yes. You know, I think that I... never mind.
F	SASHA	Where's papa?
M	TOLSTOY	I couldn't write. I was distracted I think...I had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl I knew in the war.
M	VALENTIN	A girl who died?
M	TOLSTOY	No, no...A girl I had sexual intercourse with... Sometimes we did it twice a day.
M	TOLSTOY	God bless...I've never forgotten our time together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her...
M	VALENTIN	You shouldn't torture yourself. It was a long time ago.
M	TOLSTOY	Torture? You are a virgin, aren't you.
M	VALENTIN	I try to...you know, to...
M	TOLSTOY	To be what, a good Tolstoyan?
M	TOLSTOY	You see, I myself am not a very good Tolstoyan. You should think twice about asking my advice about anything... Torture...
M	VALENTIN	Are you alright?
M	TOLSTOY	Kalya, her name was...She's an old woman now, white hair, old body like me. She'd hardly remember my name, I suspect. She may even be dead. (beat) Do you think that meant something?
M	VALENTIN	What do you mean?
M	TOLSTOY	I mean that little romance. Was there some meaning to it?
M	VALENTIN	It´s interesting. I think you would say..I mean, I´ve read where you say that the physical body isn´t real. That it´s all an illusion.
M	TOLSTOY	I say lots of things. What do you say? What do you think?
M	VALENTIN	I...I don´t know.
M	TOLSTOY	I don´t know, either.
M	TOLSTOY	Smell that...
M	VALENTIN	Lilac?
M	TOLSTOY	Precisely. It's lilac. The smell's stronger when the sun goes down.
F	SASHA	Papa!
M	TOLSTOY	I've enjoyed myself, my boy. WE'RE HERE.
F	SASHA	He's free. He's free...He's coming back
M	TOLSTOY	My dear, dear man.
M	SOFYA (O.S.)	He'll try again to convince your father to change his will.
F	SOFYA	To give the copyright as "a gift to humanity."...the reptile.
M	ANDREY	Papa's not in his right mind. He can't defend himself against these thieves. My tooth is killing me.
F	SOFYA	You're a fine son, darling. None of this make believe chastity and made up religion. I wish all my children had turned out like you.
M	ANDREY	A man'th responthibility ith to hith family.
F	SOFYA	Chertkov's notions of virtuous behavior are calculated to destroy me.
M	ANDREY	To dethtroy uth all.
F	SOFYA	There is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats.
F	SOFYA	Vladimir Grigorevich, what a surprise.
M	CHERTKOV	Sofya Andreyevna, I'm happy to see you.
F	SOFYA	And I'm happy to make you happy...always.
M	CHERTKOV	I'm glad to have a moment alone with you, Valentin. How do you think you're getting on?
M	VALENTIN	I hope my work is pleasing to Leo Nikolayevich.
M	CHERTKOV	Yes. He seems satisfied and that's good. The reports I've received from you however... There seems to be some confusion.
M	VALENTIN	What do you mean?
M	CHERTKOV	You send me never ending commentary on Tolstoy's writing. That's all very interesting but not very useful. I need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna. You must see by now she's committed to undermining her husband's best intentions.
M	VALENTIN	It's not quite so obvious to me.
M	CHERTKOV	Because she is duplicitous. You are very bright. Too bright to let her into you.
M	CHERTKOV	You value our work? I do.
M	CHERTKOV	The ideals we share?
M	VALENTIN	That's why I'm here.
M	CHERTKOV	Good, of course it is. (beat) Do you think the Countess suspects something?
M	VALENTIN	Well, I think the Countess is very suspicios by nature.
M	CHERTKOV	How so?
M	VALENTIN	I don´t think she likes you very much.
M	CHERTKOV	What does she say?
M	VALENTIN	It´s a tone I´ve picked up.
M	CHERTKOV	We simply want to distribute Tolstoy's work to the widest audience possible. She just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do. There´s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world´s happiness.
M	CHERTKOV	I can only be of limited help to the master if I don't know what's going on. Any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright, I must know. The survival of our movement depends on it. Remember who your friends are. What you've come here to do.
M	VALENTIN	Hello... Hello?
M	VALENTIN	Masha?
M	VALENTIN	Masha.
M	VALENTIN	Masha.
F	MASHA	Ssshh.
F	MASHA	Move the book.
M	VALENITN	What?
F	MASHA	Your book.
F	MASHA	Is it alright?
M	VALENTIN	What...what is it?
F	MASHA	You really are a virgin.
F	MASHA	I'm playing. It's fine. It's wonderful... Hold me.
M	VALENTIN	Wake up, wake up.
F	MASHA	I am awake.
M	VALENTIN	I want to ask you something..Say it again.
F	MASHA	It was wonderful.
M	VALENTIN	Why did you come to a place like this? What do you mean?
M	VALENTIN	You don´t follow any of the rules.
F	MASHA	You mean, why does someone who doesn't follow the rules come to a place like this?
F	MASHA	..it's not about rules. Not for Tolstoy anyway...
M	SERGEYENKO (O.S.)	Valentin Fedorovich.
M	VALENTIN	What is it?
M	SERGEYENKO	Open the door.
M	VALENTIN (O.S.)	At the moment, I'm indisposed.
M	SERGEYENKO	Yes, well...Leo Nikolayevich is here. He want s to see you.
M	VALENTIN	Tell him... I'll be down at once.
M	SERGEYENKO (O.S.)	Yes..and tell Maria Filipovna we could use another hand in the kitchen. If I see her I will... If you see her...yes. And if you're going to behave like rabbits, you should go live in the woods.
M	VALENTIN	Let me go out first...give me five minutes...
M	DUSHAN	Look at the love in him, like Jesus..suffering the children...all that...
M	TOLSTOY	An old man is a very ugly thing.
M	TOLSTOY	My dear boy. Come and kiss me.
M	TOLSTOY	Now, who is this? Maria Filipovna.
M	TOLSTOY	You're both looking so well. Life here at Telyatinki obviously agrees with you.
M	TOLSTOY	God bless you, boy. What are you nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit down.
M	TOLSTOY	Dear Masha, Valentin tells me you're the great treasure of Telyatinki. He claims you're a very gifted teacher.
F	MASHA	We're happy to have you with us.
M	CHERTKOV	What are you doing?
M	TOLSTOY	What do you mean?
M	CHERTKOV	You've killed a living thing.
M	CHERTKOV	Do you have something to say?
F	MASHA	It's absurd. That's all.
M	VALENTIN	What are you saying?
F	MASHA	I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.
M	TOLSTOY	Forgive him. He can't help it. He's a better Tolstoyan than I am.
M	CHERTKOV	It's not the message we want to send.
F	SASHA	From my mother "Nerves dreadful. Stop. Insomnia. Stop. Pulse 100. Stop. Please come home.
F	SASHA	Don't give in to her, Papa. It'll never end...I swear to God, that woman has an instinct for knowing when you're just about to enjoy yourself
M	DUSHAN	From Sofya Andreyevna. "I beg you. Stop. Unwell. Stop. Hurry back."
F	SASHA	Who taught her to use that damned machine?
M	CHERTKOV	Perhaps Sasha's right. Encouraging this may not be the best thing.
F	SASHA	It's a trick, Papa. She'll drain you. You'll be miserable.
F	SASHA	Then, let me go with you.
M	TOLSTOY	No, my dear, I'll go alone.
M	TOLSTOY	Sofya.
M	TOLSTOY	Sofya, are you ill?
F	SOFYA	I'm fine...now that you're home.
M	TOLSTOY	It's no good, you know, all this. You frightened everyone.
F	SOFYA	Did I really? I don't believe it. Not you. I'm your little bird. You know the sounds I make.
M	TOLSTOY	That was some sort of love call?
F	SOFYA	It brought you back to me.
F	SOFYA	Come out of the dark... where I can see you.
M	TOLSTOY	Why? Why? Why, do you do it? We live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house. What's wrong with a little peace now and then?
F	SOFYA	Look at me. This is who I am. This is what you married. We're older, maybe we're old, but I'm still your little chicken You're still my big cock.
F	SOFYA	Let me make you crow.
F	SOFYA	Let me make you sing.
F	SOFYA	Do you love me?
M	TOLSTOY	I do.
M	SOFIA	I want you to love me.
F	MASHA	I'm not supposed to do this either.
M	VALENTIN	Masha. You are not supposed to smoke at Telyatinki.
F	MASHA	You wouldn't look at me.
M	VALENTIN	It was difficult in front of the others.
F	MASHA	But it wasn't difficult in your bed... When it was only you and me in front of God.
M	VALENTIN	I'm not sure I was conscious of God.
F	MASHA	So, I made you forget God?
M	VALENTIN	No...
F	MASHA	Yes, only for a moment. You forgot your rules and remembered love.
M	VALENTIN	You make it sound very simple.
F	MASHA	It is simple. What we did is what men and women do, have done, will continue doing. What could be more simple? We touched each other-- stayed close together. Something passed between us. Something real. That is a betrayal of what? Of nothing. But you're afraid... All your ideas. What are you afraid of?
M	VALENTIN	I'm afraid I've hurt you, haven´t I?
F	MASHA	No. I feel a little sad, but it is not for me. It's for you.
F	SOFYA	Good morning, my darling? Do you mind if I join you?
M	TOLSTOY	Of course, my dear.
F	SOFYA	It's quite insane, my darling. Everyone is making fun of you.
M	TOLSTOY	What are you talking about?
F	SOFYA	Even the muzhiks. I heard them laughing in the barn.
M	TOLSTOY	About what?
M	TOLSTOY	Laughing about what?
F	SOFYA	I don't want to ruin last night.
F	SOFYA	Laughing about the fact that you've developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer. Your passion for Chertkov has become a standing joke.
M	TOLSTOY	I have a great affection for Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them laugh if they find it amusing.
F	SOFYA	But it's not amusing, darling. It's sick. It's not normal. You hang on his every word.
M	TOLSTOY	We have a great deal in common.
F	SOFYA	You have nothing in common. You are a genius. He's a sycophant and a pervert.
M	TOLSTOY	Because he understands what I'm trying to do? Because he tries to help me accomplish it?
F	SOFYA	He is using you. You just can't seem to see it.
M	TOLSTOY	This is absolute nonsense.
F	SOFYA	That bold, obese, idiotic man. You treat him...
M	TOLSTOY	It's impossible for you not to distract me. Let me alone... for God's sake. You're like a spoiled child.
F	SOFYA	Do you love me, Lyovochka?
M	TOLSTOY	Of course, I do.
F	SOFYA	Then why would you betray me?
M	TOLSTOY	Why do you say that?
F	SOFYA	Because of the will?
F	SOFYA	The new will.
M	TOLSTOY	There's no new will.
M	TOLSTOY	There is no new will.
F	SOFYA	Does Chertkov have it?
M	TOLSTOY	There's no new will.
F	SOFYA	But that's why he's come back. You talk about it, you and your boyfriend. You plan for it. You have no heart for the people who really love you. You'd rather be seduced by charlatans and deluded by flatterers, all in the name of love....You can't even love your own children. You can't even love me. Tell me where it is?
M	TOLSTOY	There is no new will.
F	SOFYA	Then, promise me there never will be.
M	TOLSTOY	I´ve told you the truth. Now, let me work. Please, will you?
F	SOFYA	Tomorrow, I'll go to the Station and lie down on the track. Tolstoy's wife becomes Anna Karenina herself! See how the papers will like that!
M	TOLSTOY (O.S.)	This is unbearable. You don't want a husband. You want a Greek chorus.
M	VALENTIN	She's here to question you about the new will.
M	CHERTKOV	How does she know it even exists?
M	VALENTIN	She claims Leo Nikolayevich told her she could examine the draft.
M	CHERTKOV	He is obviously not thinking clearly. And now we have to put up with her petty grasping.
M	VALENTIN	It doesn't seem petty to me.
M	CHERTKOV	I beg your pardon?
M	VALENTIN	He`s her life. The work, in her mind, is theirs...together.
M	CHERTKOV	And you're her advocate? You've been taken in by her celebrity. I worried about this.
M	VALENTIN	I'm talking about their history -- - simply that.
M	CHERTKOV	We should see her. Act as if nothing has happened.
M	VALENTIN	Nothing has happened.
M	CHERTKOV	Sofya Andreyevna, at last, you honour us with your visit.
F	SOFYA	And I'm happy to make you happy...always.
M	CHERTKOV	What is it?
F	SOFYA	Your moustache is...
M	CHERTKOV	It's a problem of the wax.
F	SOFYA	Let me get to the point. Vladimir Grigorivich, I don't wish to be your enemy. I'm delighted that my husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals. All I want is what's reasonable - an opportunity to evaluate the new will. If you agree, I'm sure we can be friends.
M	CHERTKOV	You're very kind. Sofya Andreyevna. But I can't help you. Not without specific instructions from your husband.
F	SOFYA	Leo Nikolayevich has agreed, hasn't he Val-
M	CHERTKOV	No witness you produce will change my position. But I'll certainly talk to Leo Nikolayevich at the first opportunity.
F	SOFYA	Very well.
M	CHERTKOV	I want us to be friends, too, Sofya. Leo Nikolayevich is the most valuable thing in the world, for both of us. We should endeavor to set things right between us. Give him peace. Let him work.
F	SOFYA	Yes. Valentin Fedorovich...are you coming back to the house with me?
M	VALENTIN	I'll escort the Countess home and be back in time for supper.
M	SERGEYENKO	Masha will be overjoyed.
M	SOFYA (O.S.)	Have you been keeping something from me? How delightful.
F	SOFYA	We've become close friends, I think. Tell me everything, dear boy. I love a romance.
M	VALENTIN	It's nothing, really.
F	SOFYA	A young woman in your life is nothing?
M	VALENTIN	Masha is a friend.
F	SOFYA	A lover?
M	VALENTIN	A good friend.
F	SOFYA	That sounds serious enough.
F	SOFYA	I don't mean to annoy you.
M	VALENTIN	I'm not annoyed.
F	SOFYA	You forget that I'm an experienced reader. I can read your face, every letter. It's beautifully clear. Do you love her?
M	VALENTIN	Maybe I do.
F	SOFYA	Not something they'd understand, these so called disciples of my husband. They've never understood a word he's written. What do any of them know about love?
M	VALENTIN	Sorry, sorry, I'll... I didn't mean to scare you...Are you alright.
F	MASHA	Fine...fine...Why did you...?
M	VALENTIN	I came back as soon as I could. It was a strange day. Leo Nikolayevich,...I love to listen to him. I love nothing more...
M	VALENTIN	But today I could hardly concentrate.
M	VALENTIN	All I could think of was you.
M	VALENTIN	What's wrong?
F	MASHA	I think I've confused you. I've confused us both.
M	VALENTIN	No. No. You didn´t confuse me..I was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm not afraid anymore.
M	VALENTIN	I love you, Masha!
F	MASHA	Maybe you could help me a little.
M	VALENTIN	Masha...
M	VALENTIN	Before the other night...I'd committed the act of copulation many times in my heart.
F	MASHA	Yes...
M	VALENTIN	I think about you all the time. In my heart I´ve comitted the act of copulation many times. I just want to say...It was never like it was with you.
F	MASHA	I'll wait for you, then.
F	SOFYA	Ivan, who's wearing that awful perfume?
M	CHERTKOV	I hate to say it but the Countess has become more and more dangerous.
M	TOLSTOY	Not dangerous... She's concerned for the welfare of the family.
M	CHERTKOV	And we're concerned for the welfare of mankind. Take this down.
M	TOLSTOY	It´s a terrible thing you ask. I can´t do it.
M	CHERTKOV	You've been more than reasonable. She already controls the income from your property.
F	SASHA	Listen to him, papa. He has our best interests at heart.
M	CHERTKOV	We're speaking only of the rights to your words, your ideas. With all love and respect, the Countess is too interested in making a profit from your work.
M	TOLSTOY	She's my wife. She´s part of me. We've been together now, so many years....
M	CHERTKOV	But you're more than a husband and father. She must understand that. The best interests of the people are one with your own. You belong to them.
M	TOLSTOY (O.S.)	But she won't. She'll never understand.
M	CHERTKOV	She's unstable...I wonder if she isn't ill.
M	DUSHAN	It´s sadly more than possible.
F	SASHA	I know it´s hard for you, papa. But we must be realistic.
M	CHERTKOV (O.S.)	Do you really think she's fit to control the final disposition of the will?
F	SOFYA	How dare you?
F	SASHA	What are you doing?
F	SOFYA	You're all plotting against me. In my own house, too. I bear you thirteen children. How can you betray me like this? Someone help me up.
F	SOFYA	Give everything you've got to him, your fat little catamite. "What will it be, my dearest dear, my Vladimir Grigorivich? My wife's heart on a platter? Her kidneys? With salt? But of course, my dear Chertkov, whatever pleases you. The china. The estate. Permanent copyright on everything I've ever written? Anything for you, my love."
F	SOFYA	Give me that. Give it to me, you little weasel.
M	DUSHAN	Please, Countess Sofya-
F	SASHA	Mama, please...
F	SOFYA	Now...
M	TOLSTOY	Can I not...Can I not have...
F	SASHA	You'll kill him, Mama. That's what you want, isn't it? You want him to die!"
F	SOFYA	You! Don't think you deceive me for one little moment! I know exactly what you're doing. I want to see the will. It's my right, in the name of god.
M	CHERTKOV	What are you afraid of?
F	SOFYA	You. I'm afraid of you.
M	CHERTKOV	The press is bloodthirsty. Had I wished, I could've demolished you and your family. You make it easy.
F	SOFYA	Tell them anything you like. Go ahead. Ruin us.
M	CHERTKOV	I have too much respect for Leo Nikolayevich. You're lucky.
F	SOFYA	Why can't my husband see you for what you are?
M	CHERTKOV	If I had a wife like you, I would have blown my brains out long ago. Or gone to America.
M	VALENTIN	I hope you're feeling better.
F	SOFYA	Do you like the opera?
M	VALENTIN	I took singing lessons for years. I thought about a career in music. The only thing I lacked, in the end, was talent. I'm sorry about everything.
F	SOFYA	This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her...Everyone is very moved by that...in the opera.
M	TOLSTOY	Our life together has become intolerable.
F	SOFYA	Sit down, Valentin.
M	VALENTIN	Really, I'm expected at Telyatinki.
F	SOFYA	No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner. We've had a disagreement. No more than any other married couple.
M	TOLSTOY	I didn't come for more recrimination. Despite good cause for alienation between us, I have never stopped loving you.
F	SOFYA	Of course...
M	TOLSTOY	God knows you don't make it easy.
F	SOFYA	Why should it be easy? I'm the work of your life. You're the work of mine. Its what love is.
F	SOFYA	Everything with him is hysterics
M	VALENTIN	I should go.
M	TOLSTOY	Sit down. So, this is what love is. Does that surprise you, boy?
M	VALENTIN	I thought it might be quieter, but-
M	TOLSTOY/SOFYA	God bless you
M	TOLSTOY	He's right, though. If we cannot live a decent, quiet life, if I cannot work, if I cannot find some peace, I shall simply go away.
F	SOFYA	Go? Where?
M	TOLSTOY	Not to Chertkov, but I shall go.
F	SOFYA	Go where?
M	TOLSTOY	Dushan says you're killing me.
F	SOFYA	Then go! Go! Anywhere you please!
F	SOFYA	I hate you. I hate what you've become.
M	VALENTIN	Countess...Are you alright?
M	TOLSTOY	DUSHAN!!!
F	SOFYA	You'll destroy me.
M	VALENTIN	Is she alright?
M	DUSHAN	Sofya! Open your eyes.
F	SOFYA	My back. My back... I'm hurting.
M	DUSHAN	You're lying on a fork. Sit up and you'll improve markedly...Valentin, help to get her upstairs, would you?
M	DUSHAN	She's alright. I'm more concerned for you... We should all go to bed before something else happens.
M	VALENTIN	It was terrible there today... between them. They loved each other so much, but you see what it becomes.
M	VALENTIN	Masha, what´s the matter?
F	MASHA	I'm going back to Moscow.
M	VALENTIN	What?
F	MASHA	Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon. He says I could be more useful there...which means...
M	VALENTIN	This is him punishing us, punishing me for befriending Sofya Andreyevna. For not... This is Chertkov.
F	MASHA	We've both disappointed him.
M	VALENTIN	I don't care. You can't go away. I'll talk to him. I'll make him change his mind. i´m going to make you stay.
F	MASHA	No, I want to go.
M	VALENTIN	What?
F	MASHA	I'm leaving the movement.
M	VALENTIN	You can´t leave Tolstoy.
F	MASHA	I am not. Look, when I read his Confession, it moved me, Valya. He was searching for freedom. Freedom from anger. Freedom from attachment. Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church. It moved me so much. I thought that's what it would be about. Isn't that what it's about? Freedom and love? But they mix it all up.
F	MASHA	Come with me. Please.
F	MASHA	I'm going to my room.
M	VALENTIN	Don't leave me, Masha... I need you.
F	MASHA	I know you do...I know.
M	ROSSOLIMO	I believe the Countess suffers from a mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former.
M	DUSHAN	Yes.
M	TOLSTOY	Why did you bring him here?
M	DUSHAN	He's an old friend, you know, from Rome.
M	TOLSTOY	And astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists.
M	TOLSTOY	I'm sorry, my friend, but this is all very upsetting to me.
M	DUSHAN	Yes.
M	TOLSTOY	Take them downstairs. Thank them for me. Offer them a drink.
M	DUSHAN	You'll be alright?
M	TOLSTOY	Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me, won't you, boy
F	SOFYA	Ya...your...your...I can´t remember now...Yo, what did I say? What did you mean?
M	TOLSTOY	You rest now.
M	TOLSTOY	You see, I no longer feel I have a choice in the matter. She isn't...
M	CHERTKOV	Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.
M	TOLSTOY	Is it?
M	CHERTKOV	This will insure that the complete works will live in the public domain.
M	SERGEYENKO	Monumentous.
M	CHERTKOV	Your work is the birthright of the Russian people. Now, they possess it forever.
M	CHERTKOV	Yes?
M	TOLSTOY	I need a pen.
M	CHERTKOV	Of course.
M	SERGEYENKO	I...uh...
M	CHERTKOV	What?
M	CHERTKOV	You're a secretary. How can you not have a pen?
M	SERGEYENKO	He's a secretary, too. Ask him.
M	CHERTKOV	Valentin Fedorovich, do you have a pen?
M	VALENTIN	I do.
M	CHERTKOV	Are you alright?
M	TOLSTOY	I feel like a conspirator.
M	VALENTIN	Maybe we should get back. It'll be dark soon. May I ask you something that has nothing to do with work?
M	TOLSTOY	Of course, my dear.
M	VALENTIN	Do you love your wife?
M	TOLSTOY	" Your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me." When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that I'd ever have her. I didn't want to tell her how I felt and I wanted to tell her nothing else. So I wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them. She looked completely confused, thinking it was a game or...
M	TOLSTOY	I gave her one clue. The first two Y's, I said, stand for "your youth" and then the most miraculous thing happened. She simply spoke the phrase, my phrase...
M	TOLSTOY	...as if she had read my mind. In that moment, we both knew we would always be together. For those first years, we were incredibly happy, terrifyingly happy.
M	TOLSTOY	And now this.
M	CHERTKOV	Thank you again, Valentin Fedorovich, for your forethought.
M	VALENTIN	I'm a secretary, after all.
M	CHERTKOV	You know I had thought for a time to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else. But...he said no. He said "He reminds me of myself when I was young."
M	VALENTIN	I'm leaving Telyatinki.
M	CHERTKOV	Really.
M	VALENTIN	I am going to Moscow.
M	CHERTKOV	She is leading you around the nose.
M	VALENTIN	Look, you say the movement's about love-
M	CHERTKOV	Yes... The love he tells us to practice, the love of the Gospels. Why do I have to explain this? Perfect love. Eternal love. The love that binds mankind together.
M	VALENTIN	But I've never met mankind, only men and women, imperfect men, imperfect women.
M	CHERTKOV	Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded. Go. You won't be missed ...a naive sentimentalist
M	CHERTKOV	Why are you laughing? You think I'm ridiculous.
M	VALENTIN	I'm laughing because I didn't sneeze.
F	SOFYA	Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death.
M	TOLSTOY	Then I shall try and die as soon as is convenient.
F	SOFYA	Don't be silly. They've offered one million rubles.
F	SOFYA	How can you not be pleased?
M	TOLSTOY	I don't write for publishers. I write for people.
F	SOFYA	Where are you going?
M	TOLSTOY	Valentin's in the library. He's asked to speak to me.
F	SOFYA	Splendid...while your wretched family is left to starve.
M	TOLSTOY	I don't see anyone starving in this house. On the contrary, our privilege revolts me.
F	SOFYA	But you're always first to the trough...always have been.
M	TOLSTOY	What is it, dear boy? You look unhappy. What do you want to say?
M	TOLSTOY	Sofya, what are you doing?
F	SOFYA	How could you do this to me?
M	TOLSTOY	You're not well.
F	SOFYA	You hurt me again and again. You take little pieces of me until I become nothing. I don't know who I am anymore. I read your diary. I know what you've done.
M	TOLSTOY	You behave like this, I have no choice. Now give me the gun.
F	SOFYA	No! Give me the gun!
M	TOLSTOY	Give it to me, please.
M	TOLSTOY	I'd like you to stay here tonight.
M	VALENTIN	Yes, of course.
M	SASHA (O.S.)	Valentin. Valentin.
F	SASHA	Get up. He's leaving.
M	VALENTIN	What?
F	SASHA	He´s leaving.
M	TOLSTOY	Essentials only. Nothing that isn't absolutely necessary.
M	TOLSTOY	Please...we must hurry.
M	VALENTIN	Where will you go?
F	SASHA	Absolutely essential.
M	DUSHAN	A lantern, I think. It's very dark tonight. And the apparatus for giving an enema.
F	SASHA	Everything's ready.
F	SASHA	Papa...?
M	DUSHAN	He's changed his mind. He's going back to the house.
M	VALENTIN	Do you want to go back?
M	TOLSTOY	When I was a boy, my brother Nikolai once brought me to a place when I was a boy. He told me he'd found a green stick with some words on it... the secret to happiness for all men everywhere. He hid it in the ground. I looked for it very often. I've looked for it all these years. I really believed I would find it here...but I never did.
M	TOLSTOY	I never did...but this life is behind me now.
M	TOLSTOY	Help me up, will you?
M	TOLSTOY	Give this to Sofya.
M	VALENTIN	I will.
F	SASHA	Be well. Be well.
M	TOLSTOY	Don't cry. I'll send for you when I can.
F	SASHA	I'm simply telling you what happened. He's gone. I have no idea where. Nobody does.
F	SOFYA	You're a liar. Liar!
F	SOFYA	So, he's gone. For good.
M	VALENTIN	I think so, yes.
M	SOFY	Darling Sasha, where is your father? I know you know. Please, please. Don't play games with me. Now it´s not the moment.
F	SASHA	Honestly, I have no idea. DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.
M	VALENTIN	I have this for you.
F	SASHA	The pond!
F	SASHA	Mama, Mama! Stop. Not this. Hurry! Hurry!
M	VALENTIN	Countess! My position in the house has become intolerable. What I'm doing now is what people have commonly done - leave their worldly life behind to spend their last days in peace and solitude. I beg you to forgive me for everything I've done to you, just as I forgive you with all my soul for everything you've done to me.
M	VALENTIN	Sasha, go back to the jetty. Here, let me help you.
F	SASHA	No! She's drowning. Help her!
M	VALENTIN	I will. I will. Stay here.
F	SASHA	She's dead. My mother. She's dead.
F	SASHA	Let me take you to the house, mother.
F	SOFYA	Let me die. Please. Why would you rob me of that?
F	SASHA	Let's go to the house.
F	SOFYA	Ivan, go to the station. Find out which train the master took.
F	SASHA	I see no harm in it. Let's get her to bed.
M	IVAN	Life returns to torture her for awhile.
F	SASHA	She's exhausted herself. She's slept for nearly four hours.
M	VALENTIN	I'm glad she can sleep. The pain subsides a little.
F	SASHA	The noise subsides a little.
F	SASHA	Well, a little.
F	SASHA	Come in.
M	IVAN	A message, miss.
F	SASHA	For me?
M	IVAN	No, for your father. From the Countess, miss.
F	SASHA	She's allowed to send a note to my father. I just don't know where to tell her to send it.
M	IVAN	She's addressed it to train number 9. That's the train the master took. The station master told me...
F	SASHA	Why are you giving it to me? She is allowed to send my father a note!
F	SASHA	She never gives up. "Dearest papa. Return at once. Sasha." She signed it with my name.
M	VALENTIN	Ingenious.
F	SASHA	Obvious.
F	SASHA	Yes?
M	IVAN	He gave me this as well...the stationmaster. A note for you.
F	SASHA	He's with my aunt. At the Shamardino.
M	SOFYA (O.S.)	They've all gone
M	VALENTIN	I'm here.
F	SOFYA	You're writing to your girl. That's lovely.
M	VALENTIN	I don't know if she's my girl.
F	SOFYA	But you believe you'll see her again.
M	VALENTIN	I very much hope so.
F	SOFYA	Yes. Refuse to believe in the end of love. Do all you can to prevent it...
F	SOFYA	I know you know where he is, Valentin.
F	SOFYA	I won't ask you to betray his trust...but I need you to go to him. I do. I have to see him. I have to talk to him. I won't make a scene. Promise him that. I must see him. He's right, you know, to go. She will be right behind us.
M	VALENTIN	I´ve told you she has promised she wouldn´t make any problems. But besides, where are we going?
M	TOLSTOY	We don't need a plan, my dears, we'll simply go
M	DUSHAN	TOLSTOY ABANDONS HOME! WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN...SAGE OF YASNAYA POLYANA TAKES FLIGHT!
M	TOLSTOY	I guess our little secret is out.
M	ANDREY	There's a reporter outside from the Russian World.
F	SOFYA	Tell him we've received an apologetic letter from your father..very embarrassed. We expect him back any day...
M	ANDREY	But that's a lie, right?
F	SOFYA	Yes, that's a lie.
M	VALENTIN	Please move back. Please let him breath. Please give him some room.
F	SASHA	He can´t breath. Valentin, please. The smoke is too much.
M	DUSHAN	I know. Stay back.
M	TOLSTOY	Where are we?
M	DUSHAN	It's alright. Everything's fine.
M	TOLSTOY	Where are we?
M	DUSHAN	Let me take your temperature.
M	TOLSTOY	Good old Dushan,...you needn't worry. Remember, you are my doctor, not my angel. Whatever happens, it's not your fault... I'm feeling much better now. I just need to sleep.
M	DUSHAN	Good, good. Yes.
M	DUSHAN	He will be fine.
F	SASHA	We've come to the end of the world.
M	VALENTIN	The stationmaster says we may have his house for as long as we need it. There are no inns nearby, so we're lucky.
M	TOLSTOY	Very lucky.
M	DUSHAN	Yes.
F	SASHA	You'll be comfortable here, papa. The rest of us...we'll find cots or sleep in the station.
M	TOLSTOY	And then we'll be on our way.
M	VALENTIN	Hello, hello? Could you send a cable for me?
M	VALENTIN (O.S.)	Tolstoy ill at Astapovo. Temperature high. Send it to Sofya Andreyevna, Yasnaya Polyana.
F	SOFYA	We must leave at once.
M	ANDREY	We'll make inquiries in the morning, mother.
F	SOFYA	We'll rent a train.
M	ANDREY	That'll cost a fortune.
F	SOFYA	Don't say irrelevant things, Andrey. It's unbecoming. Contact someone. I'll go and pack.
M	ANDREY	Rent a train? God!
M	CHERTKOV	Bulgakov! Where is he? Take me to him.
M	CHERTKOV	He left...astonishing...He actually, finally left.
M	VALENTIN	He wasn't well enough to travel. It's very cold.
M	CHERTKOV	It's a triumph for the movement.
M	CHERTKOV	He looks so small.
F	SASHA	Papa.
M	TOLSTOY	It's(hic)you.
M	CHERTKOV	My dear friend, waht is all of this?
M	TOLSTOY	I needed (hic) to see you. Thank you. We have so much (hic) to do. (hic) I´m sorry. Damn hic ups. Have you seen Sofya?
M	CHERTKOV	I've made a point not to.
M	TOLSTOY	I don't know when (hic) she'll come. But she'll come (hic). I know it.
M	CHERTKOV	And we'll be ready.
M	VALENTIN	Ready for what?
M	DUSHAN	I'm sorry, but it's time for your enema.
M	TOLSTOY	Don't apologize, my friend. Your enemas(hic)have become the news of the world. Now, all of you, help turn me over.
M	VALENTIN	I'd like to send another cable.
M	VALENTIN	At Astapovo. Stop. Tolstoy Ill. Stop. Heart breaking. Stop. Please Come.... That's it.
M	VALENTIN	It goes to Masha...to Maria Filipovna Melinov, Moscow. Thank you.
M	ORTHODOX PRIEST	If the Count should have a change of heart...if in the last moment he chooses to confess, mother church is there to embrace him with open arms.
F	SOFYA	I'll see what I can do, father.
F	SASHA	She's coming this way.
M	CHERTKOV	Not before she stops to tell them lies, catalogue my atrocities.
M	VALENTIN	Let me speak to her.
F	SOFYA	I want to see my husband.
M	DUSHAN	Yes I'll...uhm...
F	SOFYA	I want to see him. Now!
M	VALENTIN	Countess!
F	SOFYA	Valentin...Will you help me? I have to see him. Please.
M	VALENTIN	Of course. But I'm not certain if it´s the best time, Countess.
F	SOFYA	It is. It's the right time for me.
M	VALENTIN	Sofya Andreyevna... back.
F	SOFYA	I want to see my husband.
F	SASHA	He's too weak now, mother.
F	SOFYA	But he's not too weak to see you. Not too weak to see that...
M	CHERTKOV	Do you really want to do this here?
F	SOFYA	I am the leper outside the gate, while he sleeps with the devil himself.
F	SASHA	Vladimir Gregorovich is here because father asked him to be here.
F	SOFYA	Is that true?
F	SOFYA	Have you told him I nearly drowned in the pond?
F	SASHA	We didn't have to. It was in all the papers.
M	VALENTIN	Let me take you back.
F	SOFYA	What did he say?
F	SASHA	That if you killed yourself, he'd be upset.
F	SOFYA	He'd be upset?
F	SASHA	Horribly upset...but he could not have acted other than he did.
F	SOFYA	I want to see him. He's not your husband. He's my husband.
F	SASHA	You're unbearable.
F	SOFYA	And you are a stone-hearted bitch of a daughter.
F	SOFYA	I lost five children. Why couldn't one of them have been you?
M	CHERTKOV	Are you finished?
F	SOFYA	Valentin, will you take me back?
M	VALENTIN	Yes, of course.
F	SOFYA	I've behaved badly, haven't I?
M	VALENTIN	No, Countess, Don't worry. Not at all.
M	VALENTIN	What is it? Dushan, what´s wrong?
M	DUSHAN	Listen to him. I'm supposed to be a doctor, for God's sake.
M	TOLSTOY	Sofya!
M	DUSHAN	What is it? What is it?
M	TOLSTOY	She's come, hasn't she? She`s here.
M	CHERTKOV	You're imagining things.
M	DUSHAN	It's true, Leo Nikolayevich.
M	TOLSTOY	Sasha...where's your mother?
M	CHERTKOV	She's at home.
M	TOLSTOY	If she wanted to see me I couldn't refuse her. Is she going to come here?
F	SASHA	I don't think so...I don't know, Papa. There's no way to...
M	TOLSTOY	To what?
F	SASHA	She's at home. I'm sure of it.
M	TOLSTOY	At home.
F	SASHA	Yes, Papa.
M	TOLSTOY	Very beautiful isn't it?
F	SASHA	Our home? Yes.
F	SASHA	He said to me once..."you're like your mother. You're so full of anger."
F	SASHA	I know it's terrible...but who will protect him? I don't want him to die.
M	CHERTKOV	Kind thoughts from George Bernard Shaw.
M	VALENTIN	You lied to him.
M	CHERTKOV	Keep your voice down.
M	VALENTIN	He wants to see her. You heard him say it.
M	CHERTKOV	What exactly do you think she will bring him?
M	VALENTIN	I don´t know, they´ve been married for 48 years.
M	CHERTKOV	I´ll tell you what she´ll bring...Vanity, fuss and noise.
M	VALENTIN	She promised me-
M	CHERTKOV	What? Promised you what? You´ve seen her at close quarters, boy. You think she´s capable of restraining herself?
M	VALENTIN	They have a whole life togehter. Why do you have to deny that?
M	CHERTKOV	You're a victim of her romantic nonsense. You seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do. She travels with that unctious little priest.
M	VALENTIN	Keep the priest away-
M	CHERTKOV	These people are vultures. They send in at the last moment and welcome him back to the church. That's their fantasy. A death bed recantation. Do you have any idea the damage it would do? Everything he's dreamed of, everything we've worked for will be gone. A simple noble death is what we want. It is what he wants.
M	VALENTIN	No, you want an icon. You want to take photographs and give out postcards..You want people to kneel in front of an image you´ve created. But he doesn´t wanted that. He never wanted that, and it will give him no peace. He wants to see her...let her come.
M	CHERTKOV	I will do everything in my power to prevent that.
M	VALENTIN	Oh, God. You exhaust me.
M	CHERTKOV	I used to think you were just naive, Valentin, maybe a little stupid. I see now you're more dangerous than she is.
M	VALENTIN	Tell me one thing. That image you want to create, just looks like you, doesn´t it?
F	SASHA	It can't be right. His fever is down.
M	DUSHAN	His pulse, you see...
M	TOLSTOY	Sofya...my dear Sofya. So much has (hic) fallen to her.
M	TOLSTOY	Who's going to look after her? Someone needs to look after her.
F	SASHA	Shall I call her?
M	TOLSTOY	This is it(hic). The end.
F	SASHA	Do you want to see her, papa?
M	TOLSTOY	Sasha, Sasha.. It's(hic)nothing...Nothing.
M	CHERTKOV	It's almost over.
F	SASHA	I can't do this anymore.
M	CHERTKOV	He won´t know who she is anyway.
F	SOFYA	Has he asked for me?
F	SASHA	I want you to come. Take a coat. It's cold.
M	REPORTER	Countess...Countess...Do you have any information? Countess...Is he dying? Is he dead?
F	SOFYA	Lyovochka!
F	SOFYA	Please forgive me, my darling!
F	SASHA	Mother...
F	SOFYA	I'm a fool.. I'm a selfish woman. But I love you. Please believe me. Please understand me. Please forgive me for all my weakness and badness. Please! Please! Love me!
F	SASHA	Mother!
F	SASHA	Control yourself.
F	SOFYA	Was I shouting?
F	SASHA	You have to control yourself.
F	SOFYA	You don't speak, but I hear you.
F	SOFYA	"Do you love me, Lyovochka." "Never stopped, my little bird." "And you will never stop" "Never." "Nor ever leave me again." "Never, ever again. "Good...good... let's go home"
M	DUSHAN	First cessation.
M	DUSHAN	Second cessation.
F	SOFYA	Please forgive me if I cry a little now.
M	CHERTKOV	I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.
F	SOFYA	It's alright. What happens from now on... it will never really matter. Not really. Everything's finished.
F	SOFYA	Dushan, could you tell them your great friend is gone?
M	DUSHAN	Yes.
M	DUSHAN	At ten minutes after six in the morning, a great soul passed from our world. Leo Nikoleyevich Tolstoy is dead.
M	VALENTIN	Masha...
M	VALENTIN	Masha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's gone. He´s gone.
F	MASHA	Yes. Yes. I know, but I came for you, Valya. I came for you, too.
M	VALENTIN	I love you. I do. I love you.
F	MASHA	Then, hold me. Hold me. Hold me.
M	ORTHODOX PRIEST	As a daughter of the church, I'm sure you wouldn't object to my saying a few words at the funeral.
F	SOFYA	justification. Besides, it´s been enough talking as it is. Thank you, father. Countess...Countess.
M	VALENTIN	Excuse me, Countess. This may not be the time, but-
F	SOFYA	Valentin... and who's this...
M	VALENTIN	Masha...this is Masha.
F	SOFYA	This is your girl. Good. Good. Is there anything I can do for you?
M	VALENTIN	No, no. Not at all. I just wanted to say good bye.
F	SOFYA	Yes...Good bye, good bye. God bless you.
M	VALENTIN	God bless you, too.
F	SOFYA	Well, I'm ready to go now. Why aren´t we moving? Can't someone make it move?
F	SOFYA	Oh!
