M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	Of course, I've seen her films and always thought she was, well, fabulous -- but, you know, million miles from the world I live in. Which is here -- Notting Hill -- not a bad place to be...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	There's the market on weekdays, selling every fruit and vegetable known to man...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	The tattoo parlour -- with a guy outside who got drunk and now can't remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	The racial hair-dressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or not...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	Then suddenly it's the weekend, and from break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	... and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine... ... and some not so genuine.
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London -- that's Tony, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	So this is where I spend my days and years -- in this small village in the middle of a city -- in a house with a blue door that my wife and I bought together... before she left me for a man who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	... and where I now lead a strange half-life with a lodger called...
F	WILLIAM	Spike!
M	SPIKE	Even he. Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
F	WILLIAM	This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
M	SPIKE	That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
F	WILLIAM	What are the choices?
M	SPIKE	Well... wait for it... First there's this one...
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
M	SPIKE	Point taken.
M	SPIKE	I suspect you'll prefer the next one.
M	SPIKE	Cool, huh?
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
M	SPIKE	Wouldn't want that... Okay -- just one more.
F	WILLIAM	Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
M	SPIKE	Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.
F	WILLIAM	Good luck.
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as I set off through the market to work, little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever. This is work, by the way, my little travel book shop...
M	WILLIAM (V.O.)	... which, well, sells travel books -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those.
F	WILLIAM	Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus £347.
M	MARTIN	Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the pain.
F	WILLIAM	Yes, better get me a half. All I can afford.
M	MARIN	I get your logic. Demi-capu coming up.
F	WILLIAM	Can I help you?
F	ANNA	No, thanks. I'll just look around.
F	WILLIAM	Fine.
F	WILLIAM	That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. You'd be wasting your money.
F	ANNA	Really?
F	WILLIAM	Yes. This one though is... very good.
F	WILLIAM	I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
F	ANNA	Thanks. I'll think about it.
F	WILLIAM	If you could just give me a second.
F	WILLIAM	Excuse me.
M	THIEF	Yes.
F	WILLIAM	Bad news.
M	THIEF	What?
F	WILLIAM	We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
M	THIEF	So?
F	WILLIAM	So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
M	THIEF	What book?
F	WILLIAM	The one down your trousers.
M	THIEF	I haven't got a book down my trousers.
F	WILLIAM	Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and, what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
M	THIEF	Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
F	WILLIAM	Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec.
F	WILLIAM	Sorry about that...
F	ANNA	No, that's fine. I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind. Signed by the author, I see.
F	WILLIAM	Yes, we couldn't stop him. If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
M	THIEF	Excuse me.
F	ANNA	Yes.
M	THIEF	Can I have your autograph?
F	ANNA	What's your name?
M	THIEF	Rufus.
M	THIEF	What does it say?
F	ANNA	Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
M	THIEF	Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
F	ANNA	Tempting but... no, thank you.
F	ANNA	I think I will try this one.
F	WILLIAM	Oh -- right -- on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad. Actually -- it's a sort of masterpiece really. None of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days. And I'll throw in one of these for free.
F	WILLIAM	Very useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things.
F	ANNA	Thanks.
M	MARTIN	Cappuccino as ordered.
F	WILLIAM	Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
M	MARTIN	Who? Someone famous?
F	WILLIAM	No. No-one -- no-one.
M	MARTIN	Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it? Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr. Or at least I think it was Ringo. It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
F	WILLIAM	Topol.
M	MARTIN	That's right -- Topol.
F	WILLIAM	But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
M	MARTIN	No, well... he was quite a long way away.
F	WILLIAM	So it could have been neither of them?
M	MARTIN	I suppose so.
F	WILLIAM	Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
M	MARTIN	Not classic, no.
F	WILLIAM	Right -- want another one?
M	MARTIN	Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
F	ANNA	Oh Jesus.
F	WILLIAM	Here, let me help.
F	ANNA	What are you doing?!
F	WILLIAM	Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
F	ANNA	No thank you. I need to get my car back.
F	WILLIAM	I also have a phone. I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
F	ANNA	Okay. So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
F	WILLIAM	Eighteen yards. That's my house there.
F	WILLIAM	Come on in. I'll just...
F	WILLIAM	It's not that tidy, I fear.
F	WILLIAM	The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there.
F	WILLIAM	Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
F	ANNA	No thanks.
F	WILLIAM	Coffee?
F	ANNA	No.
F	WILLIAM	Orange juice -- probably not.
F	WILLIAM	Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
F	ANNA	Really, no.
F	WILLIAM	Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
F	ANNA	No.
F	WILLIAM	Do you always say 'no' to everything?
F	ANNA	No. I better be going. Thanks for your help.
F	WILLIAM	You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
F	WILLIAM	Take my one chance to say it. After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop.
F	ANNA	Thank you.
F	WILLIAM	Yes. Well. My pleasure.
F	WILLIAM	Nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
F	WILLIAM	'Surreal but nice.' What was I thinking?
F	WILLIAM	Coming.
F	WILLIAM	Oh hi. Forget something?
F	ANNA	I forgot my bag.
F	WILLIAM	Oh right.
F	WILLIAM	Here we go.
F	ANNA	Thanks. Well...
F	WILLIAM	I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment. Disaster...
F	ANNA	Don't worry about it. I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
F	WILLIAM	Oh my God. My flatmate. I'm sorry -- there's no excuse for him.
M	SPIKE	Hi.
F	ANNA	Hi.
F	WILLIAM	Hi.
M	SPIKE	I'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food -- and then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.
F	ANNA	Probably best not tell anyone about this.
F	WILLIAM	Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
F	ANNA	Bye.
M	SPIKE	There's something wrong with this yogurt.
F	WILLIAM	It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
M	SPIKE	Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight? I've got some absolute classic.
M	MICHAEL	Smile.
F	ANNA	No.
M	MICHAEL	Smile.
F	ANNA	I've got nothing to smile about.
M	MICHAEL	Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to ask you to marry me.
M	SPIKE	Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
F	WILLIAM	Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
M	MR. SMITH	Do you have any books by Dickens?
F	WILLIAM	No, we're a travel bookshop. We only sell travel books.
M	MR. SMITH	Oh right. How about that new John Grisham thriller?
F	WILLIAM	No, that's a novel too.
M	MR. SMITH	Oh right. Have you got a copy of 'Winnie the Pooh'?
F	WILLIAM	Martin -- your customer.
M	MARTIN	Can I help you?
M	SPIKE	Hey.
F	WILLIAM	Hi...
F	WILLIAM	Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
M	SPIKE	Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
F	WILLIAM	There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
M	SPIKE	Right. Vicious circle. And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
M	SPIKE	There's something wrong with the goggles though...
F	WILLIAM	No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
M	SPIKE	Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.
F	WILLIAM	So -- any messages?
M	SPIKE	Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
F	WILLIAM	Two? That's it?
M	SPIKE	You want me to write down all your messages?
F	WILLIAM	Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
M	SPIKE	Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
F	WILLIAM	Right. No one else?
M	SPIKE	Absolutely not.
M	SPIKE	Though if we're going for this obsessive writing-down-all-messages thing -- some American girl called Anna called a few days ago.
F	WILLIAM	What did she say?
M	SPIKE	Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
F	WILLIAM	Which was?
M	SPIKE	Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's bad enough...
F	WILLIAM	Hello. May I help you, sir?
F	WILLIAM	Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
M	RITZ MAN	I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
F	WILLIAM	No, that's right -- I know that. She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake. Imagine if you will the stupidest person you've ever met -- are you doing that...?
M	RITZ MAN	Yes, sir. I have him in my mind. And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
M	SPIKE	Try 'Flintstone.'
F	WILLIAM	What?
M	SPIKE	I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
F	WILLIAM	Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
M	RITZ MAN	I'll put you right through, sir.
F	WILLIAM	Oh my God.
F	WILLIAM	Hello. Hi. Hi.
M	ANNA (V.O.)	Hi.
F	WILLIAM	Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
M	ANNA (V.O.)	You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
F	WILLIAM	No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life. Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message. Oh -- Okay.
F	WILLIAM	Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something? Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good.
F	WILLIAM	Right. Great. Classic. Classic.
F	WILLIAM	Which floor?
M	TARQUIN	Three.
F	WILLIAM	Are you sure you...?
M	TARQUIN	Yes.
F	WILLIAM	Oh. Right.
M	KAREN	Hello, I'm Karen. Sorry -- things are running a bit late. Here's the thing...
M	KAREN	What did you think of the film?
M	TARQUIN	Marvellous. 'Close Encounters' meets 'Jean De Florette.' Oscar- winning stuff.
F	WILLIAM	I agree.
M	KAREN	I'm sorry. I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
M	TARQUIN	'Time Out.'
M	KAREN	Great. And you...
F	WILLIAM	'Horse and Hound.' The name's William Whacker. I think she might be expecting me.
M	KAREN	Okay -- take a seat. I'll check.
M	TARQUIN	You've brought her flowers?
F	WILLIAM	No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby. Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
M	TARQUIN	I'm sorry. Which hospital?
F	WILLIAM	Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
M	TARQUIN	Oh sure. Of course.
M	KAREN	Mr. Thacker.
M	KAREN	You've got five minutes.
F	WILLIAM	Hi.
F	ANNA	Hello.
F	WILLIAM	I brought these, but clearly...
F	ANNA	Oh no, ho -- these are great.
F	WILLIAM	Sorry about not ringing back. The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
F	ANNA	No, it's a stupid privacy thing. I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
M	JEREMY	Everything okay?
F	ANNA	Yes, thanks.
M	JEREMY	And you are from 'Horse and Hound' magazine?
F	ANNA	Is that so?
F	WILLIAM	So I'll just fire away, shall I?
F	WILLIAM	Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
F	ANNA	Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
F	WILLIAM	Obviously. Very difficult.
F	WILLIAM	I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
F	ANNA	No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don't know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
F	WILLIAM	Absolutely fine about it.
M	JEREMY	Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer.
F	WILLIAM	Oh yes -- excellent. Ahm -- any horses in that one? Or hounds, of course. Our readers are equally intrigued by both species. ANNA It takes place on a submarine.
F	WILLIAM	Yes. Right... But if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing?
F	WILLIAM	I'm just a complete moron. Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life. Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
F	ANNA	And what happens next in the dream?
F	WILLIAM	Well, I suppose in the dream dream scenario. I just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen.
M	JEREMY	Time's up, I'm afraid. Sorry it was so short. Did you get what you wanted?
F	WILLIAM	Very nearly.
M	JEREMY	Maybe time for one last question?
F	WILLIAM	Right.
F	WILLIAM	Are you busy tonight?
F	ANNA	Yes.
F	ANNA	Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
F	WILLIAM	Thank you. You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied.
M	TARQUIN	How was she?
F	WILLIAM	Fabulous.
M	TARQUIN	Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
F	WILLIAM	Yes. That's right. Bitch.
M	KAREN	If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
F	WILLIAM	The others?
M	KAREN	Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
M	MALE LEAD	Pleased to meet you. Did you like the film?
F	WILLIAM	Ah... yes, enormously.
M	MALE LEAD	Well, fire away.
F	WILLIAM	Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
M	MALE LEAD	I did.
F	WILLIAM	Any bit in particular?
M	MALE LEAD	Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
F	WILLIAM	Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much. Did you enjoy making that bit?
F	WILLIAM	Did you identify with the character you were playing?
M	INTERPRETER	Te identicaste con el personaje que interpretabas?
M	FOREIGN ACTOR	No.
M	INTERPRETER	No.
F	WILLIAM	Ah. Why not?
M	INTERPRETER	Por que no?
M	FOREIGN ACTOR	Porque es un robot carnivoro psicopata.
M	INTERPRETER	Because he is playing a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.
F	WILLIAM	Classic.
F	WILLIAM	Is this your first film?
M	GIRL	No -- it's my 22nd.
F	WILLIAM	Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
M	GIRL	Working with Leonardo.
F	WILLIAM	Da Vinci?
M	GIRL	Di Caprio.
F	WILLIAM	Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
M	KAREN	Mr. Thacker?
F	WILLIAM	Yes?
M	KAREN	Have you got a moment? Come in.
F	ANNA	Ahm. That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more. I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
F	WILLIAM	Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
F	ANNA	Okay -- fine.
F	WILLIAM	But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
F	ANNA	No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
F	WILLIAM	You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
F	ANNA	If that's all right.
F	WILLIAM	I'm sure it's all right. My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
F	ANNA	Okay.
F	WILLIAM	Okay.
M	MAX	He's bringing a girl?
F	BELLA	Miracles do happen.
M	MAX	Does the girl have a name?
F	BELLA	He wouldn't say.
M	MAX	Christ, what is going on in there?
M	MAX (cont'd)	Oh God.
M	MAX	Come on in. Vague food crisis.
F	BELLA	Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
F	WILLIAM	He's cooking guinea fowl?
F	BELLA	Don't even ask.
F	ANNA	Hi.
F	BELLA	Hi. Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
F	WILLIAM	Bella -- this is Anna.
F	BELLA	Right.
M	MAX	Okay. Crisis over.
F	WILLIAM	Max. This is Anna.
M	MAX	Hello, Anna ahm... Scott -- have some wine.
F	ANNA	Thank you.
M	MAX	Hi.
M	MAX	Yes, Happy Birthday.
M	MAX	Look, your brother has brought this girl, and ahm...
F	HONEY	Hi guys. Oh holy fuck.
F	WILLIAM	Hun -- this is Anna. Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
F	ANNA	Hiya.
F	HONEY	Oh God this is one of those key moments in life, when it's possible you can be really, genuinely cool -- and I'm going to fail a hundred percent. I absolutely and totally and utterly adore you and I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world and more importantly I genuinely believe and have believed for some time now that we can be best friends. What do you think?
F	ANNA	Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know -- lucky me. Happy Birthday.
F	HONEY	Oh my God. You gave me a present. We're best friends already. Marry Will -- he's a really nice guy and then we can be sisters.
F	ANNA	I'll think about it.
M	MAX	That'll be Bernie.
M	MAX	Hello, Bernie.
M	BERNIE	I'm sorry I'm so late. Bollocksed up at work again, I fear. Millions down the drain.
M	MAX	Bernie -- this is Anna.
M	BERNIE	Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
M	BERNIE	Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you. It's a hat. You don't have to wear it or anything.
M	MAX	You haven't slept with her, have you?
F	WILLIAM	That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
M	MAX	'No comment' means 'yes.'
F	WILLIAM	No, it doesn't.
M	MAX	Do you ever masturbate?
F	WILLIAM	Definitely no comment.
M	MAX	You see -- it means 'yes.'
M	BERNIE	So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
F	ANNA	I'm an actress.
M	BERNIE	Splendid. I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that. 'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.' Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
F	ANNA	Well, they can be.
M	BERNIE	I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life. What sort of acting do you do?
F	ANNA	Films mainly.
M	BERNIE	Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
F	ANNA	Fifteen million dollars.
M	BERNIE	Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
M	MAX	Right -- I think we're ready.
F	ANNA	I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
F	BELLA	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
F	HONEY	I'll show you.
F	BELLA	Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
M	BERNIE	Anna Scott?
F	BELLA	Yes.
M	BERNIE	The movie star?
F	BELLA	Yup.
M	BERNIE	Oh God. Oh God. Oh Goddy God.
F	HONEY	I don't believe it. I walked into the loo with her. I was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans... She had to ask me to leave.
F	BELLA	What do you think of the guinea fowl?
F	ANNA	I'm a vegetarian.
F	BELLA	Oh God.
M	MAX	Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
M	BERNIE	Shame!
M	MAX	I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in. I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
F	WILLIAM	Bernie.
M	BERNIE	Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me. I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
F	HONEY	Nonsense. I fancy you. Or I did before you got so far.
M	MAX	You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken, your job still pays you rather a lot of money, while Honey here, she earns nothing flogging her guts out at London's seediest record store.
F	HONEY	Yes. And I don't have hair -- I've got feathers, and I've got funny goggly eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and ... no one'll ever marry me because my boosies have actually started shrinking.
M	MAX	You see -- incredibly sad.
F	BELLA	On the other hand, her best friend is Anna Scott.
F	HONEY	That's true, I can't deny it. She needs me, what can I say?
F	BELLA	And most of her limbs work. Whereas I'm stuck in its thing day and night, in a house full of ramps. And to add insult to serious injury -- I've totally given up smoking, my favourite thing, and the truth is... we can't have a baby.
F	WILLIAM	Bella.
M	BERNIE	No. Not true...
F	BELLA	C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
M	MAX	Well, I don't know. Look at William. Very unsuccessful professionally. Divorced. Used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy around the edges -- and absolutely certain never to hear from Anna again after she's heard that his nickname at school was Floppy.
F	WILLIAM	So I get the brownie?
M	MAX	I think you do, yes.
F	ANNA	Wait a minute. What about me?
M	MAX	I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
F	ANNA	Well... a shot at it.
F	WILLIAM	You'll have to prove it. This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it. State your claim.
F	ANNA	Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade. I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
F	HONEY	Really?
F	ANNA	Really -- and one day, not long from now...
F	ANNA	... my looks will go, they'll find out I can't act and I'll become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.
M	MAX	Nah!!! Nice try, gorgeous -- but you don't fool anyone.
F	WILLIAM	Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.
F	ANNA	That was such a great evening.
M	MAX	I'm delighted.
F	ANNA	And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
M	MAX	Now you're lying.
F	ANNA	You're right. I told you I was bad at acting.
F	ANNA	Lovely to meet you.
F	BELLA	And you. I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
M	MAX	No!
F	ANNA	Night, night, Honey.
F	HONEY	I'm so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to leave but I just... look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with. I know lots of nice, cheap places... not that money necessarily... nice to meet you.
F	ANNA	You too -- from now on you are my style guru.
M	BERNIE	Love your work.
F	WILLIAM	Sorry -- they always do that when I leave the house.
F	ANNA	Floppy, huh?
F	WILLIAM	It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.
F	ANNA	Why is she in a wheelchair?
F	WILLIAM	It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
F	ANNA	And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
F	WILLIAM	You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
F	WILLIAM	Would you like to come... my house is just...?
F	ANNA	Too complicated.
F	WILLIAM	That's fine.
F	ANNA	Busy tomorrow?
F	WILLIAM	I thought you were leaving.
F	ANNA	I was.
F	ANNA	What's in there?
F	WILLIAM	Gardens. All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
F	ANNA	Let's go in.
F	WILLIAM	Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
F	ANNA	You abide by rules like that?
F	WILLIAM	Ahm...
F	WILLIAM	Heck no -- other people do -- but not me -- I just do what I want.
F	WILLIAM	Whoopsidaisies.
F	ANNA	What did you say?
F	WILLIAM	Nothing.
F	ANNA	Yes, you did.
F	WILLIAM	No, I didn't.
F	ANNA	You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
F	WILLIAM	I don't think so. No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
F	ANNA	There's no 'unless.' No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
F	WILLIAM	Exactly. Here we go again.
F	WILLIAM	Whoopsidaisies.
F	WILLIAM	It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing. I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
F	ANNA	Step aside.
F	WILLIAM	Actually be careful Anna -- it's harder than it looks...
F	WILLIAM	Oh no it's not -- it's easy.
F	ANNA	Come on, Flops.
F	WILLIAM	Now seriously -- what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile?
F	WILLIAM	Nice garden.
F	ANNA	'For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her.'
F	ANNA	Some people do spend their whole lives together.
F	WILLIAM	Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen my glasses?
M	SPIKE	No, 'fraid not.
F	WILLIAM	Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It's one of life's real cruelties.
M	SPIKE	That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
F	WILLIAM	Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.
F	WILLIAM	Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
M	SPIKE	You're welcome. Did you find them?
F	WILLIAM	Sort of.
F	ANNA	So who left who?
F	WILLIAM	She left me.
F	ANNA	Why?
F	WILLIAM	She saw through me.
F	ANNA	Uh-oh. That's not good.
M	LAWRENCE	No - No- No! Give me Anna Scott any day.
M	GERALD	I didn't like that last film of hers. Fast asleep from the moment the lights went down.
M	LAWRENCE	Don't really care what the films are like. Any film with her in it -- fine by me.
M	GERALD	No -- not my type at all really. I prefer that other one -- blonde -- sweet looking -- has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee.
M	LAWRENCE	Meg Ryan.
M	GERALD	Drug-induced, I hear -- I believe she's actually in rehab as we speak.
M	LAWRENCE	Whatever, she's so clearly up for it.
M	LAWRENCE	You know -- some girls, they're all 'stay away chum' but Anna, she's absolutely gagging for it. Do you know that in over fifty percent of languages the word for "actress" is the same as the word for "prostitute."
M	LAWRENCE	And Anna is your definitive actress -- someone really filthy you can just flip over...
F	WILLIAM	Right, that's it.
F	WILLIAM	I'm sorry to disturb you guys but --
M	LAWRENCE	Can I help you?
F	WILLIAM	Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard your conversation -- but I did and I just think, you know...
F	WILLIAM	...the person you're talking about is a real person and I think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her...
M	LAWRENCE	Oh sod off, mate. What are you, her dad?
F	WILLIAM	I'm sorry.
F	ANNA	No, that's fine. I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
F	ANNA	In fact -- give me a second.
F	ANNA	Hi.
M	LAWRENCE	Oh my God...
F	ANNA	I'm sorry about my friend -- he's very sensitive.
M	LAWRENCE	No, look, I'm sorry...
F	ANNA	Please, please -- let's just leave it there. I'm sure you meant no harm, and I'm sure it was just friendly banter and I'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts. A perfect match for the size of your brains. Enjoy your meal. The tuna's really good.
M	GERALD	You prick.
F	ANNA	I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that.
F	WILLIAM	No, you were brilliant
F	ANNA	I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
F	WILLIAM	I don't know, I'm afraid.
F	ANNA	I don't know either.
F	ANNA	Here we are. Do you want to come up?
F	WILLIAM	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
F	ANNA	There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up?
F	ANNA	Give me five minutes.
F	ANNA	Hiya.
F	WILLIAM	Hi.
F	WILLIAM	To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
F	ANNA	You've got to go.
F	WILLIAM	Why?
F	ANNA	Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
F	WILLIAM	Your boyfriend?
F	ANNA	Yes... Who is it?
F	WILLIAM	Ahm... room service.
M	JEFF	How you doing? I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
F	WILLIAM	Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
M	JEFF	Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
F	WILLIAM	I'll see what I can do.
M	JEFF	Still, not sparkling.
F	WILLIAM	Absolutely. Ice cold still water.
M	JEFF	Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
F	WILLIAM	No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
M	JEFF	And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
F	WILLIAM	Right.
F	ANNA	Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
M	JEFF	I'm sorry. Is this a problem?
F	WILLIAM	Ah -- no. It's fine.
M	JEFF	What's your name?
F	WILLIAM	Ahm... Bernie.
M	JEFF	Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
F	ANNA	Nice surprise.
M	JEFF	Liar. She hates surprises. What are you ordering?
F	ANNA	I haven't decided.
M	JEFF	Well, don't over-do it. I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
F	WILLIAM	I better leave.
F	WILLIAM	-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with. To be honest, I don't realize...
F	ANNA	I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
F	WILLIAM	I think goodbye is traditional.
M	SPIKE	Come on -- open up -- this is me -- Spikey -- I'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations. What's wrong?
F	WILLIAM	Well, okay. There's this girl...
M	SPIKE	Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend.
F	WILLIAM	She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box. And there's trouble inside.
M	SPIKE	Yeh. Yeh... tricky... tricky... I knew a girl at school called Pandora ... never got to see her box though.
F	WILLIAM	Thanks. Yes -- very helpful.
M	MAX	You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
F	WILLIAM	No -- did you?
F	WILLIAM	Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
M	MAX	Let's face facts. This was always a no-go situation. Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
F	WILLIAM	Buggered?
M	MAX	Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
F	WILLIAM	Really?
M	MAX	Her name is Tessa and she works in the contracts department. The hair, I admit, is unfashionable frizzy -- but she's as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row. Apparently.
M	MAX	Now -- try. I got completely lost -- it's real difficult, isn't it? Everything's got the word 'Kensington' in it -- Kensington Park Road, Kensington Gardens, Kensington bloody Park Gardens...
M	MAX	Tessa -- this is Bella my wife.
F	TESSA	Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair.
F	BELLA	That's right.
M	MAX	And this is William.
F	TESSA	Hello William. Max has told me everything about you.
F	WILLIAM	Has he?
M	MAX	Wine?
F	TESSA	Oh yes please. Come on, Willie, let's get sloshed.
M	MAX	Keziah -- some woodcock?
F	KEZIAH	No, thank you -- I'm a fruitarian.
M	MAX	I don't realize that.
F	WILLIAM	And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?
F	KEZIAH	We believe that fruits and vegetables have feelings so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have actually fallen from the tree or bush -- that are, in fact, dead already.
F	WILLIAM	Right. Right. Interesting stuff. So these carrots...
F	KEZIAH	Have been murdered, yes.
F	WILLIAM	Murdered? Poor carrots. How beastly.
M	ROSIE	Delicious coffee.
M	MAX	Thank you. I'm sorry about the lamb.
M	ROSIE	No -- I thought it was really, you know, interesting.
F	WILLIAM	Interesting means inedible.
M	ROSIE	Really inedible -- yes that's right.
M	ROSIE	Maybe we'll meet again some time.
F	WILLIAM	Yes. That would be... great.
M	MAX	Well?
F	WILLIAM	She's perfect, perfect.
F	BELLA	And?
F	WILLIAM	I think you have forgotten... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule. Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
M	MAX	That's not fair.
F	WILLIAM	No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
F	BELLA	Still loves you though.
F	WILLIAM	In a depressingly asexual way.
F	BELLA	I never fancied you much actually...
F	BELLA	I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny. But all that kissing my ears...
F	WILLIAM	Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
F	BELLA	Do you want to stay?
F	WILLIAM	Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
F	ANNA	Hi. Can I come in?
F	WILLIAM	Come in.
F	ANNA	They were taken years ago -- I know it was... well, I was poor and it happens a lot -- that's not an excuse -- but to make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well. So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well... the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere.
F	ANNA	I don't know where to go. The hotel is surrounded.
F	WILLIAM	This is the place.
F	ANNA	Thank you. I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
F	ANNA	These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
F	WILLIAM	Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
F	ANNA	A bath would be great.
M	SPIKE	Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic .... magnificent...
F	ANNA	You must be Spike.
F	ANNA	Hi.
M	SPIKE	Just checking.
M	SPIKE	Thank you, God.
F	ANNA	I'm really sorry about last time. He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
F	WILLIAM	No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?
F	ANNA	I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love?
F	WILLIAM	Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
F	ANNA	I have thought about you.
F	WILLIAM	Oh no no -- no.
F	ANNA	Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
F	WILLIAM	I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?
F	ANNA	Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
F	WILLIAM	Would you like me to take you through your lines?
F	ANNA	Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.
F	WILLIAM	Hand it over. Basic plot?
F	ANNA	I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
F	WILLIAM	Well done you.
F	WILLIAM	'Message from command. Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
F	ANNA	'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
F	WILLIAM	'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
F	ANNA	'Thank you.' How many mistake did I make?
F	WILLIAM	Eleven.
F	ANNA	Damn. 'And Wainwright...'
F	WILLIAM	Cartwright.
F	ANNA	'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
F	WILLIAM	'Certainly. And little Johnny?'
F	ANNA	My son's name is Johnny?
F	WILLIAM	Yup.
F	ANNA	Well, get a message through to him too.
F	WILLIAM	Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
F	ANNA	What do you think?
F	WILLIAM	Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
F	ANNA	You think I should do Henry James instead?
F	WILLIAM	I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
F	ANNA	Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
F	WILLIAM	And I think the book is the poorer for it.
F	ANNA	I can't believe you have that picture on your wall.
F	WILLIAM	You like Chagall?
F	ANNA	I do. It feels like how being in love should be. Floating through a dark blue sky.
F	WILLIAM	With a goat playing a violin.
F	ANNA	Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
M	SPIKE	Voila. Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni.
F	ANNA	Fantastic.
F	WILLIAM	I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
M	SPIKE	I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
F	ANNA	You've got big feet.
F	WILLIAM	Yes. Always have had.
F	ANNA	You know what they say about men with big feet?
F	WILLIAM	No. What's that?
F	ANNA	Big feet -- large shoes.
F	ANNA	The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
F	WILLIAM	You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
F	ANNA	Definitely. 'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek. In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
F	WILLIAM	You have a stunt bottom?
F	ANNA	I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
F	WILLIAM	Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
F	ANNA	Definitely. Ths is important stuff.
F	WILLIAM	It's one hell of a job. What do you put on your passport? Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
F	ANNA	Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he? It's delicious.
F	WILLIAM	The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
F	ANNA	Both.
F	ANNA	Today has ben a good day. Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
F	WILLIAM	Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
F	ANNA	Right.
F	WILLIAM	Oh my God... Hello.
M	SPIKE	Hello. I wonder if I could have a little word.
F	WILLIAM	Spike.
M	SPIKE	I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
F	WILLIAM	Maybe.
M	SPIKE	And she's in your house.
F	WILLIAM	Yes.
M	SPIKE	And you get on very well.
F	WILLIAM	Yes.
M	SPIKE	Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
F	WILLIAM	Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
M	SPIKE	Right. Right. You think it's the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?
F	WILLIAM	Spike!
M	SPIKE	No -- you're right.
F	WILLIAM	I'll talk to you in the morning.
M	SPIKE	Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but okay.
F	WILLIAM	Oh please sod off.
F	ANNA	Okay.
F	WILLIAM	No! No. Wait. I... thought you were someone else. I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
F	WILLIAM	Wow.
F	ANNA	What?
F	WILLIAM	Nothing.
F	WILLIAM	It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
F	ANNA	You and every person in this country.
F	WILLIAM	Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
F	ANNA	What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
F	WILLIAM	Well...
F	ANNA	No seriously. I mean, they're just breasts. Every second person in the world has got them...
F	WILLIAM	More than that actually, when you think about it. You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
F	ANNA	But... they're odd-looking. They're for milk. Your mum's got them. You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
F	WILLIAM	Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
F	WILLIAM	No, beats me.
F	ANNA	Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
F	WILLIAM	Who was Gilda?
F	ANNA	Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
F	WILLIAM	You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
F	ANNA	Oh.
F	ANNA	I'll be back.
F	ANNA	Breakfast in bed. Or lunch, or brunch.
F	ANNA	Can I stay a bit longer?
F	WILLIAM	Stay forever.
F	ANNA	Damn, I forgot the jam.
F	ANNA	You get the door, I'll get the jam.
F	WILLIAM	Jesus Christ.
F	ANNA	What?
F	WILLIAM	Don't ask.
F	ANNA	You're up to something...
F	ANNA	Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
F	WILLIAM	Undressed like this, yes.
F	ANNA	Jesus.
M	SPIKE	Morning, daring ones.
F	ANNA	It's Anna. The press are here. No, there are hundreds of them. My brilliant plan was not so brilliant after all. Yeh, I know, I know. Just get me out then. Damnit.
F	WILLIAM	I wouldn't go outside.
M	SPIKE	Why not?
F	WILLIAM	Just take my work for it.
M	SPIKE	How did I look?
M	SPIKE	Not bad. No bad at all. Well-chosen briefs, I'd say. Chicks love grey. Mmmmm. Nice firm buttocks.
F	WILLIAM	How are you doing?
F	ANNA	How do you think I'm doing?
F	WILLIAM	I don't know what happened.
F	ANNA	I do. Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
F	WILLIAM	That's not true.
F	ANNA	Really? The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is. She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.' And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
M	SPIKE	I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
F	WILLIAM	Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry.
F	ANNA	This is such a mess. I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again. For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
F	WILLIAM	You do?
F	ANNA	As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
F	WILLIAM	I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
F	ANNA	You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into will know. 'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
F	WILLIAM	That's spectacularly unfair.
F	ANNA	Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
F	WILLIAM	Now stop. Stop. I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
F	ANNA	I don't want a goddamn cup of tea. I want to go home.
F	WILLIAM	Spike, check who that is... and for God's sake put some clothes on.
M	SPIKE	Looks like a chauffeur to me.
F	ANNA	And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner. Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
F	WILLIAM	That's not true. And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior. Can't we just laugh about this? Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
M	SPIKE	What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
F	WILLIAM	Well, there are. And we don't need to go anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
F	ANNA	You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes. Our perspectives are different.
F	WILLIAM	I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
F	ANNA	Excuse me?
F	WILLIAM	Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
F	ANNA	You really don't get it. This story gets filed. Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos. Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
F	WILLIAM	Right. Fine. I will do the opposite, if it's all right by you -- and always be glad you came. But you're right -- you probably better go.
F	WILLIAM	Was it you?
M	SPIKE	I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
F	WILLIAM	Right.
F	HONEY	Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
F	WILLIAM	Blimey. What's that?
F	HONEY	The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her. You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
F	WILLIAM	Well, thanks, that's great.
F	HONEY	It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
F	BELLA	I have a little speech to make -- I won't stand up because I can't... be bothered. Exactly a year ago today, this man here started the finest restaurant in London.
M	TONY	Thank you very much.
F	BELLA	Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat here.
M	TONY	A tiny hiccough.
F	BELLA	And so we must face the fact that from next week, we have to find somewhere near to eat.
F	BELLA	I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally. The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
M	BERNIE	... get fired.
F	BELLA	No!
M	BERNIE	Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course... I was total crap.
M	TONY	So we go down together! A toast to Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the whole world!
F	HONEY	Since it's an evening of announcements ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've decided to get engaged.
F	HONEY	I've found myself a nice, slightly odd looking bloke who I know is going to make me happy for the rest of my life.
F	WILLIAM	Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
M	MAX	Is it someone we know?
F	HONEY	Yes. I will keep you informed.
F	HONEY	By the way -- it's you.
M	SPIKE	Me?
F	HONEY	Yes. What do you think?
M	SPIKE	Well, yes. Groovy.
M	MAX	Any more announcements?
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
M	MAX	There's an understatement. There are dead people on better form.
F	WILLIAM	But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
F	BELLA	I'm really horribly drunk.
M	MAX	So -- you've laid the ghost.
F	WILLIAM	I believe I have.
M	MAX	Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
F	WILLIAM	No, don't think I do.
M	MAX	Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
F	WILLIAM	Oh God no.
M	MAX	So not over her, in fact.
M	SECURITY	Can I help you?
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
M	SECURITY	Does she know you're coming?
F	WILLIAM	No, no. She doesn't.
M	SECURITY	I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
F	WILLIAM	Oh right. I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
M	SECURITY	... can't let you through.
F	ANNA	This is certainly... ah...
F	WILLIAM	I only found out you were here yesterday.
F	ANNA	I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
M	THIRD	Anna.
F	ANNA	It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
F	WILLIAM	Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
F	ANNA	But... wait... there are things to say.
F	WILLIAM	Okay.
F	ANNA	Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
M	KAREN	Come and have a look...
M	KAREN	Are you a fan of Henry James?
F	WILLIAM	This is Henry James film?
M	KAREN	This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue.
M	HARRY	Here we go. The volume control is on the side.
F	WILLIAM	That's great.
M	JAMES	We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
F	ANNA	We have to. I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
M	JAMES	Oh, stop showing off.
M	JAMES	God, that's an enormous arse.
F	ANNA	I'm not listening.
M	JAMES	No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
F	ANNA	I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
F	ANNA	So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
M	JAMES	'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
F	ANNA	And then I... right.
M	JAMES	Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
F	ANNA	Oh... no one... no one. Just some... guy from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. Bit of an awkward situation.
F	WILLIAM	Of course.
F	WILLIAM	Thank you.
M	HARRY	Anytime.
M	SPIKE	What's going on?
F	WILLIAM	I'm going to throw out these old videos.
M	SPIKE	No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this.
F	WILLIAM	Right -- let's talk about rent...
M	SPIKE	Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
M	MARTIN	cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
F	WILLIAM	Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
M	MARTIN	But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
F	WILLIAM	Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
F	ANNA	Hi.
F	WILLIAM	Hello.
F	ANNA	You disappeared.
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
F	ANNA	Well... how have you been?
F	WILLIAM	Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory
F	ANNA	Oh no. It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is... Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
F	ANNA	I thought I'd give it to you.
F	WILLIAM	Thank you. Shall I...
F	ANNA	No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
F	WILLIAM	Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know what it's for. But thank you anyway.
F	ANNA	I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice. So it's been just sitting in the hotel. But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is
F	WILLIAM	What's the thing?
F	WILLIAM	Don't even think about it. Go away immediately.
M	MR. SMITH	Right. Sorry.
F	WILLIAM	You were saying...
F	ANNA	Yes. The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
F	WILLIAM	But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
F	ANNA	You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
M	MARTIN	Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
F	WILLIAM	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
M	MARTIN	I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
F	WILLIAM	Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
M	MARTIN	Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
F	ANNA	Is that right?
M	MARTIN	Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
F	ANNA	I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
M	MARTIN	Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the filming?
F	ANNA	Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
M	MARTIN	Oh right. Right. Sorry. Always been a bit of an ass.
M	MARTIN	Anyway... it's lovely to meet you. I'm a great fan of yours. And Demi's, of course.
F	WILLIAM	Sorry about that.
F	ANNA	That's fine. There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
F	WILLIAM	Anna. Look -- I'm a fairly level- headed bloke. Not often in and out of love. But...
F	WILLIAM	... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
F	ANNA	... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
F	WILLIAM	The truth is...
F	WILLIAM	... with you, I'm in real danger. It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be. There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
F	ANNA	I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
F	WILLIAM	I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.
F	ANNA	Okay. Fine. Fine. Good decision.
F	ANNA	The fame thing isn't really real, you know. Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl. Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her.
F	ANNA	Bye.
F	WILLIAM	What do you think? Good move?
F	HONEY	Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special. I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
F	BELLA	Good decision. All actresses are mad as snakes.
F	WILLIAM	Tony -- what do you think?
M	TONY	Never met her, never want to.
F	WILLIAM	Brilliant. Max?
M	MAX	Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
F	WILLIAM	Great. Excellent. Thanks.
M	SPIKE	I was called and I came. What's up?
F	HONEY	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
M	SPIKE	You daft prick!
F	BELLA	This painting isn't the original, is it?
F	WILLIAM	Yes, I think that one may be.
M	BERNIE	But she said she wanted to go out with you?
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- sort of...
M	BERNIE	That's nice.
F	WILLIAM	What?
M	BERNIE	Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
F	WILLIAM	It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
F	WILLIAM	Oh sod a dog. I've made the wrong decision, haven't I?
F	WILLIAM	Max, how fast is your car?
M	MAX	If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
M	BERNIE	And we intend to use them!
M	MAX	Where's Bella?
F	HONEY	She's not coming.
M	MAX	Sod that. Bernie -- in the back!
M	MAX	Come on, babe.
F	BELLA	Where are you going?
M	MAX	Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
F	BELLA	Crazy. Go along Bayswater...
F	HONEY	That's right -- then Park Lane.
M	BERNIE	Or you could go right down to Cromwell Road, and left.
F	WILLIAM	No!
M	MAX	Stop right there! I will decide the route. All right?
M	ALL	All right.
M	MAX	James Bond never has to put up with this sort of shit.
M	BERNIE	Bloody hell, this is fun.
F	WILLIAM	Is Miss Scott staying here?
M	RITZ MAN	No, sir.
F	WILLIAM	How about Miss Flintstone?
M	RITZ MAN	No, sir.
F	WILLIAM	Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
M	RITZ MAN	No, sir.
F	WILLIAM	Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.
M	RITZ MAN	There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126 -- but she checked out an hour ago. I believe she's holding a press conference at The Savoy before flying to America.
M	BERNIE	We have lift off!!
M	SPIKE	Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.
M	SPIKE	Go!
F	HONEY	You're my hero.
M	MAX	Go!
F	WILLIAM	Excuse me, where's the press conference?
M	MAN AT SAVOY	Are you an accredited member of the press?
F	WILLIAM	Yes...
M	MAN AT SAVOY	That's a Blockbuster video membership card, sir.
F	WILLIAM	That's right... I work for their in- house magazine. 'Movies are our business.'
M	MAN AT SAVOY	I'm sorry, sir...
F	BELLA	He's with me.
M	MAN AT SAVOY	And you are?
F	BELLA	Writing an article about how London hotels treat people in wheelchairs.
M	MAN AT SAVOY	Of course, madam. It's in the Lancaster Room. I'm afraid you're very late.
F	HONEY	Run!
M	JEREMY	Yes... You -- Dominic.
M	QUESTIONER 1	How much longer are you staying in the UK then?
F	ANNA	No time at all. I fly out tonight.
M	JEREMY	Which is why we have to round it up now. Final questions.
M	QUESTIONER 2	Is your decision to take a year off anything to do with the rumours about Jeff and his present leading lady?
F	ANNA	Absolutely not.
M	QUESTIONER 2	Do you believe the rumours?
F	ANNA	It's really not my business any more. Though I will say, from my experience, that rumours about Jeff... do tend to be true.
M	QUESTIONER 3	Last time you were here, there were some fairly graphic photographs of you and a young English guy -- so what happened there?
F	ANNA	He was just a friend -- I think we're still friends.
M	JEREMY	Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.
F	WILLIAM	Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends?
F	ANNA	I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
F	WILLIAM	And what would you say...
M	JEREMY	No, it's just one question per person.
F	ANNA	No, let him... ask away. You were saying?
F	WILLIAM	Yes, I just wondered whether if it turned out that this... person...
M	OTHER JOURNALIST	His name is Thacker.
F	WILLIAM	Thanks. I just wondered if Mr. Thacker realized he'd been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider, whether you would... reconsider.
F	ANNA	Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
F	WILLIAM	That's very good news. The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
M	JEREMY	Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your question again?
M	QUESTIONER 1	Yes -- Anna -- how long are you intending to stay here in Britain?
F	ANNA	Indefinitely.
M	SPIKE	What happened?
F	HONEY	It was good.
