M	BENNIE	You'll get used to him. Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away.
M	HUMMEL	Hi Barb. The house sold yesterday. I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area. Some things I have to do. Things I couldn't do while you were here. Maybe you would have approved. Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention. But now they'll learn how it
M	ARMY M. P.	General Hummel, sir. It's an honour. Is the Colonel expecting you, sir?
M	HUMMEL	Held better be. This is a security inspection.
M	ARMY M. P.	Yes, sir!
M	COLONEL CALLAHAN	General Hummel! This is a surprise!
M	HUMMEL	That's the idea, Colonel.
M	SGT. CRISP	This is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and infiltrated your compound. I'm afraid you and your men are my prisoners, sir.
M	SGT. CRISP	Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.
M	HUMMEL	Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel. Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator. This is not a tight ship. I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.
M	ISHERWOOD	Son of a bitch...
M	GOODSPEED	You owe me five dollars, Marvin.
M	ISHERWOOD	I was told this was exciting work.
M	GOODSPEED	Patience, Marvin. It has its moments. and shows it. A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian
M	ISHERWOOD	Bosnian refugee camp? I don't get it.
M	GOODSPEED	Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin. Serbians don't like Bosnians. Read a newspaper. It's good for you. Hold out your hand. does so. It's shaky.
M	ISHERWOOD	I'm okay. Really. Let's do it-
M	GOODSPEED	Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.

M	GOODSPEED	Careful, goddamn it Marvin!
M	ISHERWOOD	What's hap... what's happening....?
M	DR. LING	Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear. You're okay. grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and
M	GOODSPEED	I've got some bad news and some really bad news. The bad news is the gas is corrosive. It's eating our suits. What's the really bad news.
M	GOODSPEED	Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas
M	ISHERWOOD	The acid's eating... it's eating my fucking suit...
M	GOODSPEED	Chill, Marvin. WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?
M	DR. LONNER	Something's blocking the pipes, Bill. When in Christ's name
M	DR. LING	Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.
M	DR. LING	You die, we all die, Bill. Inject yourself, then diffuse it. Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.
M	GOODSPEED	Get that away from me. I hate needles. INJECT YOURSELF! LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?
M	DR. LONNER	It's coming, it's coming ...
M	DR. LING	Ten seconds, Bill.
M	ISHERWOOD	Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY IT'S REAL. drops the syringe. Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED,
M	DR. LING	Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...
M	DR. LING	Three, two... the gas is clear!
M	DR. LING	Next time use the atropine!
M	GOODSPEED	I don't like needles.
F	CARLA	Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed)
F	CARLA	Hey there.
M	GOODSPEED	Hey honey.
F	CARLA	Wrote a new song. Wanna hear it?
M	GOODSPEED	Not now.
F	CARLA	Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.
M	GOODSPEED	Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.
F	CARLA	Better?
M	GOODSPEED	Much better. She sits with him. Puts her arm around him.
F	CARLA	What happened baby. Tell me.
M	GOODSPEED	Had a close one.
F	CARLA	You want to talk about it?
M	GOODSPEED	Not really.
F	CARLA	You know how I feel about what you do.
M	GOODSPEED	Could we change the subject?
F	CARLA	That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
M	GOODSPEED	Hey! Now there's some good news.
F	CARLA	You think I'm too... ethnic for country music?
M	GOODSPEED	Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you. I hope that's a compliment. I could change my name. How 'bout Bobby Sue Pestalozzi? Billy io Pestalozzi?
M	GOODSPEED	Stick with Carla.
F	CARLA	Okay. How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? Six years, Bill. We've lived together six years.
M	GOODSPEED	We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out ... Billy, this probably isn't the best time ... Bill, I'm uhhh.
F	CARLA	I'm pregnant. GOODSPEED
M	PARK RANGER JOE	Alcatraz - "the Rock" - is the most famous, and was the most feared, prison ever built. Here the inmates were allowed one hour
M	FEMALE TOURIST	Is it really true no one escaped?
M	PARK RANGER JOE	True, madam. From 1936 until the prison's closing in 1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made
M	PARK RANGER JOE	Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells.
M	PARK RANGER JOE	Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of tourists laugh and move inside the cells.
M	ALCATRAZ PARK RANGER	You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys. Is there a problem?
M	SGT. CRISP	Big problem.
M	PARK RANGER JOE	Don't want to be locked up, fellahs?
M	HUMMEL	Not today. You go ahead.
M	PARK RANGER JOE	I don't think so hah hah.
M	HUMMEL	I think so.
M	TOURISTS	Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going on... ?
M	CAPTAIN FRYE	General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.
M	HUMMEL	Deploy as planned, Captain. Aye, aye, sir.
M	HUMMEL	Hello Ladies and Gentlemen. You are my prisoners. I have no intention of harming you. You will be fed regularly. That is all you need to know for now.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Can it wait till morning, Agent Wood, I'm going to hear Bruce Springsteen ...
M	AGENT WOOD	In that?
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Christ, the concert's for the Prince of Wales or somebody ...
M	AGENT WOOD	I really think you should take this call personally.
M	HUMMEL	First: I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on Alcatraz Island. Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Wait. Who is this?
M	HUMMEL	Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Mary Jane, get the Pentagon! (to Agent Wood) Call the San Francisco office. It seems Alcatraz was just re-opened.
M	HUMMEL	At ease, Gentlemen. It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation. The heart performs one thing, the legs adjutant in the Gulf. Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik. You and your men are new to me.
M	CAPTAIN FRYE	Would the General like a recitation of our service records?
M	HUMMEL	I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent. I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here. You
M	CAPTAIN FRYE	Profit is not my motive, sir. I am here to redress a wrong.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.
M	HUMMEL	This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law. In the military, they are called
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Well, sir, frankly ... EL I see that I am '
M	HUMMEL	The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. Plain and simple. An insurrection against a government to which we have
M	HUMMEL	The question is what kind of traitor are we. Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have all of you?
M	HUMMELS' OFFICERS	Yes, sir.
M	HUMMEL	Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not return. All of you can live with that?
M	OTHER OFFICERS	Yes, sir.
M	HUMMEL	Well, I cannot. So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.
M	CAPTAIN HENDRIX	But General, you'll be prosecuted.
M	HUMMEL	Yes, Captain. And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets. It wasn't
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal of... Jesus. The man is a hero.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	A legend. During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C. single-handedly. Saved his whole company. Hence the nickname "gunfighter."
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? Anybody read it?
M	RAYDEN SINCLAIR	No. Give me the skinny.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting
M	NAVAL ATTACHE	General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the table.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Frank, this is Albert Kramer.
M	HUMMEL	Hello Al. Howlre Judy and the kids?
M	GENERAL KRAMER	They're fine. I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway. You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. Can you help us out?
M	HUMMEL	I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into China.
M	HUMMEL	Who is that. Identify yourself.
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.
M	HUMMEL	How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.
M	RAYDEN SINCLAIR	I'm thirty-three.
M	HUMMEL	Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday
M	NAVAL ATTACHE	The President calling from Moscow.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Continue Frank.
M	HUMMEL	Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred. These men died for their country and they weren't even given This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that?
M	HUMMEL	Identify yourself.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	F.B.I. Director Womack, General.
M	HUMMEL	You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.
M	WOMACK	Is this true?
M	HUMMEL	If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from. Good luck.
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	General, I've just spoken to the President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care if ...
M	HUMMEL	Someone please gag that man. Alert the media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with V.X., General Peterson?
M	GENERAL PETERSON	In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...
M	RAYDEN SINCLAIR	Well that's not so bad ...
M	I GENERAL PETERSON	Thousand. Seventy thousand. Dead. one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story office building. Get the
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?
M	GENERAL PETERSON	Napalm. Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm. It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation. The problem is that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. 'Course he does. "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still That explains Hummells time frame. He knows we're not operational. What would it take, General?
M	GENERAL PETERSON	To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36 hours? An act of God. All right, we can try. But view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. (to F.B.I. Womack) Who's your
M	AGENT WOOD	I'll find out.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Tell him to pack a bag for San Francisco.
F	CARLA	Don't stop... do no stop.
M	GOODSPEED	Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
M	GOODSPEED	I've got to go to San Francisco. No. I'm sorry, but NO. I need you here with me. We need to talk about this...
M	GOODSPEED	I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't... I cannot deal with this right now ... (softly) Bill, I am very Catholic.
M	GOODSPEED	I love you. I will marry you. I just didn't plan on this, that's all. Tell you what: come to San Francisco.
F	CARLA	Really? Really?
M	GOODSPEED	It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...
F	CARLA	... We'll finish what we started. Baby, are you sexy in those boots ... A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - intelligence.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	You've studied the architectural plans.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	They're useless. Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort. It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years. Under there is a maze What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	The former warden?
M	AGENT WOOD	Died in 1979. The guards we contacted are useless. There was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he
M	GENERAL PETERSON	Didn't three guys escape? I thought I saw a movie about it.
M	AGENT WOOD	It's a Hollywood myth. No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.
M	C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	There is someone who can help us.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	The C.I.A. Director and I have something to discuss in private.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You're not actually suggesting ...
M	C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	The man spent every night for six months making a dry-run of his escape. He knows every inch of that island. We have to,
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I am very uncomfortable about this.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I knew, I knew someday, this would come back to bite us.
M	C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. When was the last time you saw him?
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	when he escaped from San Quentin.
M	C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	The man was an S.A.S. trained killer.
M	C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	Can we risk letting.him out?
M	C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	The question is: can we not? now, we have no idea why.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed. What's your education?
M	GOODSPEED	B.A. Columbia. M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology. Excellent. What do you know about V.X. gas?
M	GOODSPEED	This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	No Goodspeed. It's not a training exercise.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	The following is a state secret. Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution. His name is John Mason. A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962,
M	AGENT SANCHEZ	Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez. Do not argue and do not question. He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels.
M	AGENT SANCHEZ	You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Don't even entertain it. This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.
M	GOODSPEED	Why's he going to help us now? Mason's papers are in order, sir.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.
M	AGENT SANCHEZ	Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I don't need that to get what you want.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Sanchez - try subtlety.
M	AGENT SANCHEZ	It's my middle name. Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ...
M	GOODSPEED	Jesus look at this guy.
M	SANCHEZ	I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez.
M	MASON	In charge of what? Fucking me over for another three decades?
M	SANCHEZ	Hey. Easy. I just want to talk.
M	MASON	You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez? Fucking Bloody Idiots. I don't want to talk to you.
M	SANCHEZ	Just some questions about Alcatraz. It's a tourist attraction now. You remember Alcatraz, Mason.
M	MASON	Do I remember Alcatraz.
M	SANCHEZ	Not the island itself. The tunnels underneath it. Real subtle, SANCHEZ... There's no harm in cooperating with us.
M	MASON	Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?
M	SANCHEZ	Maybe there's a gift in it for you.
M	MASON	Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.
M	GOODSPEED	"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."
M	MASON	Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?
M	SANCHEZ	I don't have time for this shit... Yes. I can read.
M	MASON	The story of Alchimadus. Know it?
M	SANCHEZ	No.
M	GOODSPEED	Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
M	MASON	Thomas a Beckett. Heard of him?
M	SANCHEZ	Maybe. Not really.
M	GOODSPEED	Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
M	MASON	Solzhenitsyn. I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him. Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.
M	SANCHEZ	Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here. You can trust the F.B.I.
M	MASON	That's a good one, Sanchez. What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who can't tell a lie? A mute. longer exists. Suddenly, over a INTERCOM:
M	U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS	Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word with you?
M	SANCHEZ	Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail. Impressive, Sanchez.
M	GOODSPEED	You mind if... uhm.... I take a shot?
M	SANCHEZ	He'll eat him alive.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	He's already had you for the first course. Go.
M	GOODSPEED	Take his cuffs off.
M	MASON	Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?
M	GOODSPEED	No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. Mr. Mason, we really need your help. That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office. It makes you a free man,
M	MASON	What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
M	GOODSPEED	I'm a field agent.
M	MASON	Tell me what you really do. Don't answer that, GOODSPEED ....
M	GOODSPEED	I'm a chemical biological weapons expert. at the pardon contract, thinking.
M	MASON	You said I'd be a free man. Define free
M	GOODSPEED	Uhm, well, emancipated. Unfettered.
M	MASON	I know what the fucking word means, idiot. In this context.
M	GOODSPEED	I don't understand....
M	MASON	During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
M	GOODSPEED	Well yes I suppose ...
M	MASON	You suppose?
M	GOODSPEED	Yes. You'll be outside.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed.
M	MASON	What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?
M	GOODSPEED	A hostage situation. A matter of life and death.
M	MASON	Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists. I want a shower and a new
M	GOODSPEED	I think we can arrange that. GOODSPEED enter.
M	SANCHEZ	Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?
M	U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS	I'll have this forwarded to the President, Director. No. You'll give it to me. Give it to me, Reynolds.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Show Attorney Reynolds outside there's a car waiting for him. And SANCHEZ -
M	GOODSPEED	Sir, that's a legal document.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'll decide what's legal, Goodspeed. AS --
M	GOODSPEED	those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn: had something in common. up the coin. It has a DEEP BURR it. He moves to the mirror; begins carving into the glass.
M	GOODSPEED	They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong. What's going on, sir?
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You're out of your depth, Goodspeed. You are on a need to know basis and you do not need to know.
M	MASON	one more thing: a shave and a haircut. Hello Womack.
M	CPT. GILER	What it's all about, sir: Willy Peter burns steel, burns titanium; it'll sure burn up your poison and everything else in the atmosphere.
M	GENERAL PETERSON	I need four F-16's equipped with air-to-ground missiles within... .... twenty-six hours.
M	LT. FISK	Let me name some things that are more possible, General, with
M	CPT. GILER	Can't do it, General.
M	GENERAL PETERSON	You can. And you will.
M	CPT. GILER	Get yer minds off Budweiser, baseball, and broads, fellahs - we're goin, ,round the clock!
F	CARLA	Hi! Bill and Carla ain't in! State your business! Make it interesting!
M	GOODSPEED	Listen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come to San Francisco.
M	GOODSPEED	I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.
F	CARLA	Like hell I'm not... that MASON is staring at him.
M	MASON	Who's Carla? And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?
M	GOODSPEED	You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.
M	MASON	You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed? F.B.I.Agents Star and Hunt are in the Jackets off, shoulder holsters on.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I personally picked this suite. Only one exit. from the shower wearing a huge hotel them.

M	MARSHAL CORD	That's right.
M	MASON	well if it excites-you ...
M	MARSHAL CORD	Put the goddamn clothes on.
M	BARBER	I can't do a decent job with these.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	That's all you get.
M	BARBER	I'm an artist, not a barber.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	without these he can't stab you in the throat.
M	MASON	Shall we do this outside? In the sunshine?

F	JADE	How can I answer that? I don't know if we can.... after 19 years, just start like that.
M	MASON	We are the same blood.
F	JADE	But I don't know you.
M	MASON	where to begin. My name is John Paul Mason. I'm Scottish. I attended Dartmouth Naval College. My favorite color is green. I like books. I like a good joke. At one time I shot a pretty fair round Maybe it's better I go.
F	JADE	No. You're doing okay.
F	JADE	You lied to me.
M	GOODSPEED	F.B.I. miss. Your father is working with us. He's helping us resolve a.... .... dangerous situation.
F	JADE	He is?
M	GOODSPEED	Yes madam. We've got to go, John.
M	MASON	Jade - remember what I said.
M	GOODSPEED	No cuffs until we get to the cars,
M	MASON	You surprise me, Goodspeed. Now I'm going to surprise myself: thank-you, you could have handled that differently.
M	GOODSPEED	You almost got me killed. Twice.
M	MASON	Hows your jaw?
M	GOODSPEED	It hurts.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars. You try to escape
M	MASON	Pleased to meet you. at the head of the table 122 in of a SCALE MODEL OF ALCATRAZ. COMMANDER ANDERSON and ten NAVY
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Okay, one more time: down this second fork fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber. Turn left at the water pump,
M	MASON	No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber. Fifty-seven to the
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	That's not what you said three minutes ago.
M	MASON	It's not?
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Excuse me. Womack.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty questions."
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Then he's keeping it to himself. He's fucking with me and I don't have the time.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	What if he went with you?
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Out of the question. He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men. He's a security risk. Who says he won't bolt as
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'll handle that. Chaney.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You're not cooperating, John. Maybe this will help. I'm sure you're curious about what's happening on Alcatraz. Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue force - have Yes, John, including your daughter.
M	MASON	You son-of-fucking-Satan.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOA WOMACK	Mr. MASON has a strong incentive to help us, Commander Anderson.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Get him some gear. He's going to the Rock. Goodspeed! up from a computer screen generating images of different angles of a V.X. ROCKET. He walks over to the
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed. Tell us what you know.
M	GOODSPEED	Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. Here. The prison morgue. It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense. V.X. gas begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?
M	GOODSPEED	No sir, but I've studied them ....
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	That's great, Goodspeed. You're in the Bureau, so you've had weapons training.
M	GOODSPEED	A little, sir.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	So you've never been in a combat situation.
M	GOODSPEED	No sir. Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Won't be necessary.
M	GOODSPEED	Sir, these are very complicated devices...
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	I know they are, Goodspeed. That's why you're going with us.
M	GOODSPEED	Sir?
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Get him some gear.
M	MASON	Wait just a minute. This little twat's going to deal with the poison? He's gonna get us all fuckin' killed!
M	S.E.A.L. DANDO	Nice to meet you too.
M	SANCHEZ	You look like shit.
M	GOODSPEED	Thank you.
M	SANCHEZ	You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
M	GOODSPEED	I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork. They say, "Bill, you're too fucking smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the commercial. Then the call finally comes, and
M	SANCHEZ	Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed.
M	GOODSPEED	I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir. Maybe the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ....
M	SANCHEZ	Spit it out.
M	GOODSPEED	My girlfriend's pregnant.
M	SANCHEZ	What's the really bad news.
M	SANCHEZ	Goodspeed, GODDAMN IT ...
M	SANCHEZ	Agent Cord, get over to the Pan Pacific Hotel and bring Goodspeed's girlfriend to this facility please!!
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Seventeen hours left. What the fuck is he doing? How much time does it take to transfer money from one account

M	HUMMEL	Hummel.
M	SECURITY ADVISOR LOUIS LINDSTROM	Hello Frank, Lou Lindstrom. I'm in the oval office with General Kramer.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	We're having some problems with the account transfer, Frank.
M	HUMMEL	Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about this.
M	HUMMEL	Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ...
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	The only thing the President will give you is a fair trial after you're caught, General.
M	HUMMEL	That you, Sinclair? What exactly do you do at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine?
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	Now you give me some coddamn respect, General ....
M	HUMMEL	You want respect, you child, you coffee server? Let's talk about Dave Ridgeway.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank?
M	HUMMEL	A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist he got.
M	LOUIS LINDSTROM	This is going nowhere Frank .... Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to man into San Franciscols business district. You have twelve hours to What's the word from Mojave?

M	ROYCE	Looks all clear, sir.
M	BAXTER	Nothing.
M	HUMMEL	Tell 'em to stay out there.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us to a room with no exit. Skipper, blow it or burn it?
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	No time for the torch. Explosives'll bring the fucking world down on us. (turns to Mason) An idea, please, we're tight
M	MASON	Wait for me to unlock the door.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.
M	MASON	Under there.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	You are shitting me. You catch one of those steam bursts and you're a corpse.
M	MASON	True. I memorized their timing.
M	S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD	Uhh sir, you said never leave his side ...
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	You're not required to follow, Lieutenant Shepherd. This man is going to die.

M	HUMMEL	Drop your weapons.
M	ANDERSON	here, General Hummel. Commander. Team
M	HUMMEL	Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them
M	SANCHEZ	Oh Christ this isn't happening.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	Sir, we know why you're out here. God knows I agree with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against all enemies. Foreign, sir, and domestic. (shouts now) General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud. You know goddamn well that I cannot give that order... A COLUMN - S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and BOYER stare into the
M	HUMMEL	Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander. I'm not going to ask again.
M	HUMMEL	Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.
M	COMMANDER ANDERSON	You men following the General: You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that? We all have shipmates we remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that
M	HUMMEL	That's a nice speech, Commander. I heard plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. They all added up to zero. Pretty words
M	S.E.A.L. BOYER	It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us ...
M	S.E.A.L. REIGERT	Get a grip on yourself .... him. Tries to pull him down.

M	SANCHEZ	It's over.
M	F.B.I. TECHNICIAN	We've still got movement. Numbers eleven and twelve. That's GOODSPEED and.... Mason.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	If mason's still alive, it's not over.
M	GOODSPEED	We're never gettin off this island.
M	GOODSPEED	.... god Jesus we're gonna die
M	SANCHEZ	You told me I am on a "need to know" basis. Well goddamn it, I need to know. Who the fuck is John Mason. Start talking, Director, or 1962. J. Edgar Hoover is head of the F.B.I., some say the country. It's no secret the esteemed Mr. Hoover kept himself.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	The British sent over their best operative, John Mason, to steal it.
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Our agents caught MASON at the Canadian border but with no microfilm. It's never been found.
M	SANCHEZ	What about the daughter? why didn't Hoover use her as leverage?
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	He died in 1972. She wasn't born yet Today it's a different Bureau and no one wants to touch this.
M	SANCHEZ	My god, you're not saying ...
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	has been incarcerated without trial on American soil since 1962. He knows our most intimate secrets of the last half century. The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about
M	F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	John MASON was an S.A.S. trained killer, one of MI-6's best operatives ever - John MASON was one of the most dangerous men on earth. his -9 mil pistol in self-defense.
M	GOODSPEED	Don't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
M	MASON	For christ's sake. MASON trudges down the tu=el. Goodspeed
M	GOODSPEED	Wait. Where're you going?
M	MASON	Off this island. You mind?
M	GOODSPEED	Yes I mind. I mind very much.
M	SANCHEZ	Goodspeed, Goodspeed, come in.
M	MASON	You've got a phone call.
M	GOODSPEED	It's me sir.
M	SANCHEZ	What is happening? Where's Mason?
M	GOODSPEED	He says he's leaving the island sir.
M	SANCHEZ	Don't let him do that.
M	GOODSPEED	He's got a gun, sir.
M	SANCHEZ	What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL? Get him back!
M	HUMMEL	I never wanted this. Jesus christ.
M	BAXTER	We knew it might happen, Frank.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Maybe now they'll pay up.
M	CAPTAIN HENDRIX	Maybe now they won't.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Then maybe we'll execute a few hostages.
M	S.E.A.L. DANDO	You'll go to hell for this General.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Put a bullet in him.
M	CAPTAIN FRYE	You heard him. End it.
M	HUMMEL	CAPTAIN, HOLSTER THAT SIDEARM.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Yes sir. kneels. Feels Dandols carotid artery.
M	ROYCE	He's dead anyway sir. at HUMMEL on the monitor.
M	HUMMEL	You have a made a terrible mistake and more of our brothers have died in vain. Let's not repeat this.
M	SGT. CRISP	General! This man's weapons and tac radio are missing!
M	HUMMEL	Rodent problem, people. Let's flush the pipes. and his men exit the Cell House and fan out in teams across the island. still trailing after

M	GOODSPEED	F.B.I. Stop right there. I really mean it.
M	MASON	If you really mean it, take the safety off.
M	SANCHEZ	Goodspeed. Goodspeed, come in. Have you resolved this?
M	GOODSPEED	Now he has all the guns, sir. . You've got to help me. What do you want me to do, beg?
M	MASON	Save your breath and your dignity, if you have any. I am leaving. I am getting my daughter and getting the hell out of here. the wall of flame ROARING them. MASON Goodspeed.
M	MASON	Hold your breath.
M	MASON	Come on. And keep your mouth shut. Now what?
M	MASON	Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue. You said that's where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.
M	GOODSPEED	I don't get it. You're going to help me?
M	MASON	No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons. What the fuck do you think?
M	GOODSPEED	You don't have to get all bent out of shape.
M	MASON	What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through
M	GOODSPEED	All right, all right. Don't call me idiot, okay?
M		And there.
M	MASON	Cottonmouth snakes. They breath through their skin. Oil clogs
M	MASON	sprays the motor oil across the pool. The snakes scatter. The pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK. MASON wades in. Goodspeed follows.
M	GOODSPEED	Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're the convict, and you have all the guns. at a fork in the tunnel. _
M	GOODSPEED	The morgue?
M	MASON	Never hesitate.
M	GOODSPEED	You didn't learn that in prison.
M	MASON	No, and I used to be a lot quicker.
M	GOODSPEED	I've got some questions for you but they can wait.
M	GOODSPEED	Careful. The second you don't respect this, it kills you. I need a hand here. Mason. Now. the poison pearl strand to Mason. MASON holds it like a string What... exactly does this do to you?
M	GOODSPEED	Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system. Then loss of muscular function. Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled
M	MASON	Sounds like my first marriage. the chip from each chem round and pockets it.
M	GOODSPEED	Pier 39 come in.
M	SANCHEZ	Goodspeed? Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.
M	GOODSPEED	We're in the morgue. I'm removing the rocket's guidance system chips. Without em the rocketslll fly about 500 feet and splash down like a wounded duck.

M	MASON	I think I've got arthritis.
M	HAYDEN SINCLAIR	The President arrives in three hours. His directive is to string Hummel along until the airstrike is operational.
M	LOUIS LINDSTROM	What's the word from Mojave, General?
M	GENERAL KRAMER	They're going as fast as they can.
M	LT. FISK	We're fucked, cap'n.

M	CPT. GILER	What are you saying?
M	LT. FISK	The pilots are gonna have to drop em manually. We're talkin, from the mono-rail tunnel. The launcher on Alley is in the b.g. Suddenly, from the loudspeaker above them:
M	HUMMEL	Attention Navy Seals, attention.
M	GOODSPEED	He thinks we're Seals. Congratulations. You've taken some things of mine. I can't convince you to return them so I'll put on someone who can.
M	MALE VOICE	Hell... hello.
M	HUMMEL	Tell them your name and age.
M	LARRY HENDERSON	My n...name is L... larry Henderson. I'm forty-eight.
M	HUMMEL	Good Mr. Henderson, continue ...
M	LARRY HENDERSON	I don't know who you are, but p please, there's a gun kill me quivering voice trails off. Replaced by:
M	HUMMEL	Convinced? Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have two minutes. turns to Mason.
M	GOODSPEED	I'll go.
M	MASON	Wrong.
M	GOODSPEED	What, vou?
M	MASON	I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
M	GOODSPEED	Good point. Okay here, take 'em. What are you doing?
M	MASON	Now they only have three rockets left.
M	GOODSPEED	What about Mr. Henderson?
M	MASON	Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.
M	GOODSPEED	Wait.
M	MASON	Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
M	GOODSPEED	I... I don't know if I can do this.
M	MASON	There's only one way to find out. I'll try to give you time. And Goodspeed.... Don't be an idiot. Put that on.
M	GOODSPEED	Well thank-you, thank-you very much.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Gotta be kidding me. They send an old man.
M	HUMMEL	I thought I'd been in the service a long time. Name and rank, sailor.
M	MASON	John Paul Mason. Royal Navy. Commander.
M	HUMMEL	You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.
M	MASON	I feel strangely at home.
M	HUMMEL	How's that?
M	MASON	You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
M	HUMMEL	Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility, Commander Mason?
M	MASON	Quite unique.
M	HUMMEL	How's that?
M	MASON	I was a guest here. Suddenly a voice:
M	GOODSPEED	Freeze. Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly. PVT. MCCOY appears. Looking down, sees GOODSPEED and Cox. He cinches his REPELLING CLIP to the steel
M	HUMMEL	Well you're some kind of joker, Mason. Maybe you're a lunatic. Are you of sound mind, Mason?
M	MASON	I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people. You are. demeanor changes. Hard now. Tight.
M	HUMMEL	Give me the guidance chips.
M	MASON	I threw them in the bay.
M	HUMMEL	That was stupid of you.
M	MASON	Would you have shot him7
M	HUMMEL	You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand necessity.
M	MASON	Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins."
M	HUMMEL	"Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible. Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.
M	MASON	Article 7, American Constitution? "Treason against the United States shall consist of... 11
M	HUMMEL	The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander. Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and stupidity. I see little difference in my motivation.
M	HUMMEL	Do you, Commander Mason?
M	HUMMEL	Frye, Crisp, go! wildly his gun until CLICK, the clip is spent. Cox and McCoy step
M	MCCOY	Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave I'll cut your belly open and pull it out.
M	GOODSPEED	Mason. Mason?
M	MASON	It's about time.
M	GOODSPEED	Where are you?
M	MASON	Above you. Literally and figuratively. BRAIDING THE STRIPS into a long rope. The rope is quite
M	GOODSPEED	This is tiny.
M	MASON	You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed? Or another portion of your anatomy ....
M	GOODSPEED	The cell, Mason.
M	MASON	Five feet by seven. Try living in one for a year. What happened?
M	GOODSPEED	I only got one chem round. There are two left. I fucked up.
M	MASON	Surprise, surprise.
M	GOODSPEED	I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
M	MASON	An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
M	GOODSPEED	What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon. Tell me.
M	MASON	Let's say our countries had a little dispute. They both knowingly shafted me.
M	GOODSPEED	How?
M	MASON	Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed? I don't mean a vacuum cleaner ... listens intently and PETERSON The target. Alcatraz Island. This is not a precision
M	GENERAL PETERSON	Captain Giler?
M	CPT. GILER	We jerry-rigged a release lever. You'll find it on the left side of the cockpit. It's got two positions: safety and release. Throw
M	GOODSPEED	Jesus. Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was? Make a trade?
M	MASON	Some trade. They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the
M	GOODSPEED	I see your point. Something's been on my mind. About your escape.
M	MASON	What?
M	GOODSPEED	You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe -
M	GOODSPEED	I only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information ...
M	MASON	Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this: it was easier than getting in.

M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Prepare for launch General? General?
M	HUMMEL	Not yet.
M	CAPTAIN FRYE	General Hummel, noon is approaching.
M	HUMMEL	I'm aware of the time, Captain.
M	LOUIS LINDSTROM	When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Seven hours ago.
M	GENERAL KRAMER	Get me the President.
M	GOODSPEED	Mason. John. What happened - the injustice done to you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this. A million people across that Bay will die.
M	MASON	Only one of them I care about.
M	GOODSPEED	You were once a different man.
M	MASON	You don't know what kind of man I was.
M	GOODSPEED	You were a civil servant. Sworn to do your duty. Just like me. begins climbing down to the waterline.
M	CAPTAIN DARROW	Eleven fifty-seven, General. Three minutes to go.
