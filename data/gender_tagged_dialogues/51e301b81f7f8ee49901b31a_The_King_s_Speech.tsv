M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BERTIE	You look like a Christmas tree.
F	ELIZABETH	Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't rain.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Never trust the wireless. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 4.
M	BBC NEWS READER	Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This is the BBC National and World Programmes taking you to Wembley Stadium. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 5.
F	ELIZABETH	Why wasn't he told?
M	COSMO LANG	Ten million people listening around the world, Mam. Possibly more. His brother, and father, have been broadcasting since last year.
M	KING GEORGE V	Get on with it. Show what you're made of!
M	BERTIE	Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.
M	COSMO LANG	I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage for all the world. And on such an important occasion.
M	BERTIE	No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was standing before you today. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 6. Be that as it may...my brother David is attending to other duties in the furthest parts of this vast Empire...
M	KING GEORGE V	Just needs more practice.
F	ELIZABETH	Are you there?
M	LIONEL (O.S.)	In the lav. "How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees?"
F	ELIZABETH	Pardon?
M	LIONEL	Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist.
F	ELIZABETH	I'd be more comfortable in your office.
M	LIONEL	That's for clients. Where's Mister J?
F	ELIZABETH	He doesn't know I'm here.
M	LIONEL	That's not a promising start.
F	ELIZABETH	My husband's seen everyone. They were all useless. He's given up hope.
M	LIONEL	A bit premature.
F	ELIZABETH	Because he hasn't seen you?
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	You're very sure of yourself.
M	LIONEL	I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
F	ELIZABETH	Of course my husband wants to be cured! His position requires public speaking upon occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement may grow more frequent.
M	LIONEL	He should change jobs. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 8.
F	ELIZABETH	He can't.
M	LIONEL	Indentured servitude?
F	ELIZABETH	Something of that nature.
M	LIONEL	Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his personal history. I'll make a frank appraisal.
F	ELIZABETH	Doctor...
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	...I do not have a "hubby". We never talk about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'. You must come to us.
M	LIONEL	Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf, by my rules.
F	ELIZABETH	Perhaps you'll make an exception?
M	LIONEL	I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
F	ELIZABETH	A name used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His Royal Highness was aboard.
M	LIONEL	I'm considered the enemy?
F	ELIZABETH	You will be, should you continue to be un- obliging. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 9. For my method to succeed there must be mutual trust, complete honesty, and total equality. That process takes place in my consultation room. No exceptions.
F	ELIZABETH	In which case... I should have kept my pledge. I promised my husband I'd stop seeking "The Great Cure." I've wasted your time. And mine.
M	LIONEL	Bloody hell, I buggered that.
M	VALENTINE	Stand and deliver!
M	LIONEL	`ow dares molest...Jack The Ripper?!
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Beware, Highwaymen, or I'll run yee through.
M	PETER	We're Swagmen, not Highwaymen, Dad. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 10.
M	LIONEL	Oh. Beware, jolly Swagmen, I'll skewer yer gizzards.
F	MYRTLE	You'll all hang from the gallows if you don't come for tea.
M	LIONEL	Boys, I think we'd best go up.
M	LIONEL	Had a visit from a lady today.
F	MYRTLE	Another spoiled silly?
M	VALENTINE	May we be excused?
M	LIONEL	You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
M	THE BOYS	Thanks, dad!
M	LIONEL	And mum.
M	THE BOYS	And mum!
F	MYRTLE	Take your plates.
M	MYRTLE (CONT'D)	No wonder about the silly. You're so good at what you do. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 11. At what I do. Twas a Lady with a capital L.
F	MYRTLE	Oh, Lionel, that'd get us home in grand style wouldn't it?!
M	LIONEL	She came on behalf of her husband. Which is not the proper way. I told her I was fully booked. She was...too high and mighty. Know what I mean.
F	MYRTLE	We wouldn't want that.
M	MYRTLE (CONT'D)	Hard to feel sorry for that sort.
M	LIONEL	Had a call. Wish me luck?
F	MYRTLE	Course, Lionel. Loads and loads.
F	ELIZABETH	"Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were flown."
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Tomorrow, Chapter IV, `The Flight'. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 12.
M	MARGARET ROSE	Oh, to fly away!
M	BERTIE	Weren't they lucky.
M	LILIBET	One would have to learn to fly properly of course.
M	MARGARET ROSE	Now a Daddy story!
M	BERTIE	Can I be a penguin instead?
M	LILIBET	The horsie story, please.
M	BERTIE	Ah well.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Once upon a time there were two horsies. A white horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The white horse said "neigh". The black horse said, "neigh". The white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. The black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the end of the story. Now off to bed.
M	LILIBET	A silly story really. But Father tells it rather well. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 13.
M	BERTIE	David called. He said come round to The Fort on Friday and stay for dinner.
F	ELIZABETH	Will she be there?
M	BERTIE	I suppose.
F	ELIZABETH	Seriously?
M	BERTIE	Seriously, she'll be there.
F	ELIZABETH	I think I meant... is David serious?
M	BERTIE	About our coming?
F	ELIZABETH	About her!
M	BERTIE	A married American? Twice divorced? He can't be.
F	ELIZABETH	She can.
M	MUFFLED VOICE (UNSEEN)	Now?
M	DIRECTOR	Now!
M	LIONEL	"Now..." TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 14. "Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York..."
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths..."
M	DIRECTOR	Thank you. Beautiful diction...but I don't hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
M	LIONEL	What do you suggest?
M	DIRECTOR	Continue to do whatever you do, and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction.
M	KING GEORGE V (O.S.)	Stride boldly up to the bloody thing, stare it square in the eye, and talk to it as you would to any decent Englishman. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 15.
M	BERTIE	I d-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can.
M	KING GEORGE V	Show who's in command. If you don't, this devilish device will change everything. Used to be, all a King had to do was look reasonable in uniform and not fall off his horse. Now we must creep cap in hand into people's homes that smell of boiled cabbage, and speak nicely to them. We're reduced to that lowest, basest of all creatures...we've become...actors! Don't give me a look of defeated pathos. This is a family crisis!
M	BERTIE	Father, we're not a family, we're a firm.
M	KING GEORGE V	We're the oldest, most successful, corporation in the world and sitting on thrones is our business! But any moment now we may be out of work. Your brother came to me the other day, livid a certain lady has been refused an invitation to my Silver Jubilee. I pointed out she wasn't a lady and most definitely wasn't his wife.
M	BERTIE	What did David say?
M	KING GEORGE V	She made him sublimely happy. I said: that was probably because she was sleeping with him. "I give you my word we've never had immoral relations." "As my son, as Prince of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear your friendship with this woman is an absolutely clean one?" "I do", he said. "Look me in the eye," I said. "On my honour" he said. Stared straight at his father... and lied.
M	BERTIE	Oh my brother... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 16.
M	KING GEORGE V	When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months. Who'll pick up the pieces? David's friend, Oswald Mosley? His black-shirt British Union of Fascists are marching through London. Hitler terrorizing half of Europe, Stalin the other half. Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?
M	BERTIE	What're you going to say?
M	KING GEORGE V	The usual guff. The Archbishop writes it. My people love to hear me say it. Spoken fluently, of course.
M	KING GEORGE V (CONT'D)	That's the chap who taught me how to use this contraption. You touch your chin with your thumb and the `thing' with the end of your little finger. Splendid fellow.
M	BBC NEWS READER	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is the BBC, broadcasting direct from Buckingham Palace upon the occasion of the Royal Silver Jubilee. His Majesty: King George the Fifth.
M	KING GEORGE V	"I can only say to you, my very very dear people, that the Queen and I thank you from the depths of our hearts for all the loyalty and - may I say so? - the love with which this day and always you have surrounded us. I dedicate myself anew to your service for all the years that may still be given to me."
M	BBC NEWS READER	That's how a King speaks. I showed HM how to do it.
M	BERTIE	They didn't come to see us, Father.
M	KING GEORGE V	Pretend.
M	BERTIE	Where's David?
M	KING GEORGE V	Bedding his American whore. Come, join the fun! You'll have to do a lot more of this. I'm sending him to the Midlands. With all the factory noise they won't hear a word he says. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 18. What's needed is cooperation...
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	...buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...
M	BERTIE	Is this necessary?
F	ELIZABETH	You know perfectly well.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Neglects to tell them what must be done, how its to be done, and who's to do it.
M	BERTIE	David has `the touch'. They adore him. I'll wager they're saying: There's the useless one who can't speak.
F	ELIZABETH	There's no receptionist.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	The Johnsons.
M	LIONEL (O.S.)	Not finished yet.
M	BERTIE	How'd you find this physician?
F	ELIZABETH	Classifieds; next to "Saucy model, Shepherd's Market".
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Comes highly recommended. Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor. Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
M	BERTIE	I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.
F	ELIZABETH	I'm not sure he wants to see you.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Perhaps this was a mistake.
M	ANNA	You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
M	BERTIE	I'm not actually Mr ... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 20.
M	ANNA	I know. Dr Logue says... Lionel!
M	ANNA	Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it being a pleasant day, take a stroll. Was that alright?
M	LIONEL (O.S.)	Bloody marvellous.
M	ANNA	Thank you...Lionel.
M	LIONEL (O.S.)	Mr. Johnson, do come in.
M	BERTIE	My wife's favorite colours.
M	LIONEL	Glad we have something in common.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	My lads build them. Make yourself comfortable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 21.
M	BERTIE	Please...
M	LIONEL	What?
M	BERTIE	You're too close. Five paces is the rule of thumb.
M	LIONEL	That might be difficult in this office.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to convince her men will find her even more attractive as a silent partner. The perfect woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd your wife change her mind and ask for an appointment?
M	BERTIE	I can't discuss that.
M	LIONEL	What can we talk about?
M	BERTIE	That's better. When speaking with a Royal one waits for the Royal to start the conversation and chose the topic.
M	LIONEL	Your joking. That won't work here.
M	BERTIE	I admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	You call this making me comfortable?
M	LIONEL	You call this being forthcoming?
M	BERTIE	Aren't you interested in treating me? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 22.
M	LIONEL	Only if you're interested in being cured.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Cuppa tea?
M	BERTIE	No thank you.
M	LIONEL	I need one. Any idea what you're letting yourself in for?
M	BERTIE	Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor Logue.
M	LIONEL	Call me Lionel.
M	BERTIE	I prefer Doctor.
M	LIONEL	I prefer Lionel. My family calls me far worse. What shall I call you?
M	BERTIE	The Duke of York is appropriate.
M	LIONEL	Oh please.
M	BERTIE	Your Royal Highness then.
M	LIONEL	Much more informal.
M	BERTIE	Prince Albert? Or Frederick? Arthur? George? I've lots of names to choose from.
M	LIONEL	How about Bertie? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 23.
M	BERTIE	Only my family uses that.
M	LIONEL	That's what I'll call you then. We must be true equals.
M	BERTIE	If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be at home with my family and no-one would give a damn.
M	LIONEL	Don't do that.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
M	BERTIE	My physicians say it's good for stuttering, relaxes the throat.
M	LIONEL	They're idiots.
M	BERTIE	They've all been knighted.
M	LIONEL	Makes it official then. House rules: no smoking.
M	BERTIE	I thought here we're "equal".
M	LIONEL	As a monarchist I thought you'd appreciate these are my digs and here I rule. No smoking. What was your earliest memory?
M	BERTIE	I beg your pardon?
M	LIONEL	First recollection of the world? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 24.
M	BERTIE	I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
M	LIONEL	Why're you here then?
M	BERTIE	Because I bloody well stutter! And you bloody well can't fix it!!!
M	LIONEL	Temper.
M	BERTIE	One of my numerous faults.
M	LIONEL	Do you stutter when you think?
M	BERTIE	Don't be ridiculous.
M	LIONEL	One of my many faults. How about when you talk to yourself?
M	BERTIE	I don't talk to myself!
M	LIONEL	Come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, Bertie.
M	BERTIE	Stop calling me that!
M	LIONEL	Shan't call you anything else.
M	BERTIE	Then we shan't speak!
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Must I pay for this?
M	LIONEL	Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 25.
M	BERTIE	Of course not!
M	LIONEL	Proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture.
M	BERTIE	When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!!
M	LIONEL	Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
M	BERTIE	Easy money. You're on.
M	LIONEL	See your shilling then.
M	BERTIE	Royals don't carry money.
M	LIONEL	How convenient.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.
M	BERTIE	If there is a next time.
M	LIONEL	Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.
M	BERTIE	I certainly can't read The Bard.
M	LIONEL	`Easy money'.
M	BERTIE	"To be or not to be, That is the question. Whether it is wiser..." There! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 26.
M	LIONEL	Not so fast.
M	BERTIE	I proved I can't read.
M	LIONEL	You proved you can't listen.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	A princely bob is at stake.
M	BERTIE	You're playing music.
M	LIONEL	I'm aware.
M	BERTIE	How can I hear what I'm saying?!
M	LIONEL	Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
M	BERTIE	You're not well acquainted with Royal princes, are you?
M	LIONEL	I want to demonstrate that when you can't hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus proving your impediment is not innate.
M	BERTIE	Rubbish.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	I was terrible. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 27.
M	LIONEL	Flawless.
M	BERTIE	I know how I sound!
M	LIONEL	Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
M	BERTIE	I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
M	LIONEL	Souvenir of our first and presumably last encounter.
M	LIONEL	I'm finished with your husband.
M	BERTIE	I'm finished with Doctor Logue!
M	LIONEL	Lionel.
M	WILLIE'S MUM	Was that...?
M	LIONEL	Certainly not. How's it going, mate?
M	WILLIE'S MUM	William isn't trying hard enough.
M	LIONEL	Willie? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 28.
M	WILLIE	Ddddddoooing ggggggggood.
M	LIONEL	Why am I not surprised?
M	BERTIE	The bloody man did parlour tricks and cheated me out of a shilling.
F	ELIZABETH	They'll see.
M	DAVID	Hello, B-b-bertie. B-b-been waiting long?
M	BERTIE	Three days. Where've you been?
M	DAVID	I was busy.
M	BERTIE	So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 29.
M	DAVID	She'll recover.
M	BERTIE	Father won't.
M	DAVID	He's doing this on purpose.
M	BERTIE	Dying?!
M	DAVID	Some sod tipped him off Wallis is getting a quickie divorce and we're going to make our marriage a fait accompli. As an act of pure spite, Father's trying to depart prematurely in order to complicate matters.
M	BERTIE	You believe that?
M	DAVID	Wallis explained it. She's terribly clever.
M	WIGRAM	The Instruments Of Succession, Your Majesty.
M	KING GEORGE V	You're next? God help us. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 30.
M	WIGRAM	At the appropriate moment, Your Majesty.
M	QUEEN MARY	I want my jewelry divided equally. Elizabeth gets first choice. She's not greedy.
M	BERTIE	May I remind you, you're not the one who's dying, Mother.
M	QUEEN MARY	Where are the others?
M	BERTIE	Lord Wigram and Dr Dawson are making arrangements.
M	QUEEN MARY	What sort of arrangements?
M	BERTIE	They didn't say.
M	QUEEN MARY	And David? Fetch him.
M	DAVID	I'm on with Wallis! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 31.
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy. Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately. Til then, sweet love. Wally misses me terribly
M	BERTIE	Mother says you're late for supper.
M	DAVID	Clocks set five minutes in advance, so as not to be late. When I'm King I shall set them back!
M	QUEEN MARY	Lord Wigram has requested permission to order the coffin.
M	BULTER	The Archbishop of Canterbury.
M	DAVID	Who the hell invited him?!
M	QUEEN MARY	Nobody. Don't swear.
M	DAVID	Somebody should bloody well dis-invite him. Father swears.
M	WIGRAM	That would be rash.
M	QUEEN MARY	You're not your father. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 32.
M	WIGRAM	His Grace can be a persistent enemy. We need friends.
M	DAVID	Show the toad in.
M	COSMO LANG	Whatever can I contribute in this dreadful hour?!
M	COSMO LANG	"Tranquilly"? "Serenely"?
M	WIGRAM	Peacefully.
M	COSMO LANG	"The King's life is moving peacefully to its..." "Termination"?
M	WIGRAM	Close.
M	COSMO LANG	"...to its close."
M	WIGRAM	As a man of letters you're heaven-sent to assist in the editing of our press communique.
M	WIGRAM (CONT'D)	I'll telephone this through to the BBC and alert The Times to hold the morning edition. The problem is...if we're to keep to schedule...time is running out. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 33.
M	DAVID	Is my father late for death?
M	WIGRAM	We wouldn't want the news delivered by the disreputable afternoon press, would we?
M	COSMO LANG	Who knows what sensational side issues those tabloids might report.
M	DAWSON	Perhaps a peaceful termination?
M	DAWSON	Three quarters of a gram of morphia and a gram of cocaine injected into the distended jugular vein.
M	NURSE	No! that's...
M	DAWSON	You may leave.
M	DAWSON (CONT'D)	Time of expiration, 11:55 pm. On schedule.
M	QUEEN MARY	Long live the King. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 34.
M	BERTIE	The look in mother's eyes, it was...ghastly.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	What's this bloody thing doing here?!
F	ELIZABETH	Bertie...
M	BERTIE	The man was a total fraud!
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Would you like to hear?
F	ELIZABETH	Not particularly.
M	BERTIE	Well I think you should. You should know what goes on. Telling me he could help me read flawlessly. Lying bastard! Listen to this babble!
M	BERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE	"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: - Whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them?" TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 35.
M	BERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE (CONT'D)	"...sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? And by opposing end them? And by opposing..."
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Turn that devil off!
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	If only one could do that so easily in real life.
M	BALDWIN	Chamberlain thinks that Hitler can be reasoned with.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Neville is an old woman. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 36.
M	BALDWIN	That's the direction its going, Winston. You're out of step.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	We'll see who trips and falls.
M	BALDWIN	Enough pleasantries. I've asked you here because you seem to be the only sensible member of the King's camp.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Nice of you to say so, Stanley.
M	BALDWIN	Is he willing to be reasonable?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Depends on the definition.
M	BALDWIN	Has he seen the light?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	He has.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	Our Monarch basks in the warming rays of a celestial orb. Her name is Wally.
M	VALENTINE	Dad?
M	LIONEL	Mmmm?
M	VALENTINE	Time for a Shake, dad. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 37.
M	LIONEL	You sure?
M	THE BOYS	Shake! Shake! Shake!
M	IAN	Bet its the Scottish Play.
M	VALENTINE	Othello!
M	PETER	Perhaps something with Falstaff?
M	LIONEL (FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET)	"Art thou afeard?"
M	THE BOYS	Caliban!
M	LIONEL	"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again." TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 38.
M	BERTIE'S VOICE	Doctor Logue?
M	LIONEL	Must be a tradesman. Off you go, lads. Mum should be home from work.
M	BERTIE'S VOICE	Logue...?
M	BERTIE	Lionel...it's Bertie.
M	LIONEL	My condolences. I didn't expect you.
M	BERTIE	Thank you. I didn't expect to be here. May I come in?
M	LIONEL	No.
M	BERTIE	What?
M	LIONEL	My wife doesn't think it's a good idea.
M	BERTIE	Your wife?
M	LIONEL	Myrtle. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 39.
M	BERTIE	Myrtle? Myrtle's never met me. I've never met Myrtle. May we discuss Myrtle in private? Its not proper talking about our women on the street.
M	BERTIE	What happened to your shoulder?
M	LIONEL	Sore back.
M	BERTIE	What's your Myrtle got to do with me? Elizabeth doesn't much care for you either, but here I am.
M	LIONEL	That woman has style.
M	BERTIE	Which is why she dislikes you. You're far too familiar. May we discuss this properly?
M	LIONEL	You look dreadful.
M	BERTIE	Another example of exactly the sort of thing you don't say to a Royal. And you're too close.
M	LIONEL	But you're not Royal in this room. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 40.
M	BERTIE	Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes you.
M	LIONEL	Not there!
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Curtis bi-plane, now a Curtis mono-wing.
M	BERTIE	Oh I say, I'm terribly sorry. Tell your lads I'll buy a new one.
M	LIONEL	You don't have any money. I'll fix it. So, Bertie, what brings you here? Your father's death?
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Mine lay rigid, fists clenched angrily at his sides, daring the Reaper: take me, you bastard!
M	BERTIE	What was he angry about?
M	LIONEL	I was a great disappointment.
M	BERTIE	Thought he'd be proud of you.
M	LIONEL	So did I.
M	BERTIE	A man of stature?
M	LIONEL	A clerk.
M	BERTIE	Oh. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 41.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	I was informed, after the fact, my father's last words were: "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together." Couldn't say that to my face. Your mother?
M	LIONEL	Coughed herself to death when I was young.
M	BERTIE	Oh.
M	LIONEL	I remember going to the theatre with her. Not real theatre...traveling players.
M	BERTIE	I've been to Australia.
M	LIONEL	Not where I lived.
M	BERTIE	My brother. That's why I'm here.
M	LIONEL	What's he done?
M	BERTIE	Can't say.
M	LIONEL	I'm going home now.
M	BERTIE	You must undersand, I can't puh-puh-puh...
M	LIONEL	Try singing it.
M	BERTIE	Pardon?
M	LIONEL	Know any songs?
M	BERTIE	"Swanee River". 42.
M	LIONEL	Very modern.
M	BERTIE	Happens to be my favorite.
M	LIONEL	Sing it.
M	BERTIE	Certainly not. May I help? Always wanted to build models. Father wouldn't allow it. I had to collect stamps. He collected stamps.
M	LIONEL	Only if you sing. Goes like this... "Way down upon the..."
M	BERTIE	I know the words! "Way down upon the Swanee River. ..." Etcetera.
M	LIONEL	You didn't stutter.
M	BERTIE	Of course I didn't stutter, I was singing! One doesn't stutter when one sings! Oh... Well I can't waltz around on State occasions warbling!
M	LIONEL	You can with me.
M	BERTIE	That's because you're peculiar.
M	LIONEL	I take that as a compliment. Cut some struts from the balsa. Sorry, hard to show you what to do at five paces. Would you like a cup of tea?
M	BERTIE	No. Yes. Thank you. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 43.
M	LIONEL	You were about to sing an aria concerning your brother.
M	BERTIE	I'm not crooning to the tune of "Swanee River!"
M	LIONEL	Try "Camptown Races" then. "The Arch of C, he said to me, doo-dah doo- dah..." That sort of thing.
M	BERTIE	I can't talk, or sing, about your future King, doo-dah, doo-dah...
M	LIONEL	My future King? He's your future King too. Did that cause friction? Knowing he'd grow up to be King, but you wouldn't.
M	BERTIE	Certainly not. I've always looked up to David. Water's boiling.
M	LIONEL	Two lumps or one?
M	BERTIE	I've a sweet tooth. To tell the truth...
M	LIONEL	Always preferable. Cover it with tissue.
M	BERTIE	...it was a relief. Knowing I wouldn't be King.
M	LIONEL	Why's that? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 44.
M	BERTIE	I wouldn't have to give speeches!
M	LIONEL	No smoking. What's the age difference?
M	BERTIE	Eighteen months.
M	LIONEL	But for eighteen months you would've been King?!
M	BERTIE	We didn't think about it that way, doctor. Doo-dah doo-dah. David and I were very close.
M	LIONEL	As you said: eighteen months.
M	BERTIE	As brothers!
M	LIONEL	How close?
M	BERTIE	Young bucks... You know.
M	LIONEL	I don't, or I wouldn't ask. Did you go after the same girls?
M	BERTIE	Upon occasion.
M	LIONEL	Princess Elizabeth?
M	BERTIE	What an extraordinarily rude thing to say! David did try to be her beau at one point. Before I met her. She wouldn't have him. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 45. Not like my father...he and his brother, when they were young, kept a girl in St John's Wood and shared her on alternate nights.
M	LIONEL	Now dope the other wing. Did David tease you?
M	BERTIE	They all did. "Buh-buh-buh-Bertie". Father encouraged it. "Spit it out, boy!" Thought it would make me stop. Is this necessary?!
M	LIONEL	Otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue.
M	BERTIE	I mean the damn questions!
M	LIONEL	Mandatory. Tell me more about your storybook childhood. What was your earliest memory?
M	BERTIE	You asked that before.
M	LIONEL	This time I'd like an answer.
M	BERTIE	Being born.
M	LIONEL	How can you remember that?
M	BERTIE	December 14th.
M	LIONEL	I don't understand.
M	BERTIE	"Mausoleum Day". Prince Albert departed on that date. I was named Bertie to placate Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 46.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Let's stick to medical history please. I'm naturally left handed, which was considered inappropriate.
M	LIONEL	And?
M	BERTIE	I was punished. Now I'm right handed.
M	LIONEL	Anything else?
M	BERTIE	Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Metal splints were made...worn night and day...very painful. Now I have straight legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it be: "Myrtle says no?"
M	LIONEL	You sound angry.
M	BERTIE	Yes, I told you, I have a temper.
M	LIONEL	Angry at me, or at your brother?
M	BERTIE	He's fallen in love!
M	LIONEL	How dreadful.
M	BERTIE	With the wrong sort of woman!
M	LIONEL	What's wrong with her?
M	BERTIE	She's American.
M	LIONEL	Some of them must be lovable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 47.
M	BERTIE	This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be happy, but the family, the Church, the nation, won't have it.
M	LIONEL	Can't they fornicate privately like adults?
M	BERTIE	If only! David used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment. But now...
M	LIONEL	"Queen Wallis of Baltimore"?
M	BERTIE	Please.
M	LIONEL	Does sound a bit iffy.
M	BERTIE	I made a smudge!
M	LIONEL	Touch it up.
M	BERTIE	You want me to beg for help?
M	LIONEL	I advise you never to beg. Especially if you might be King.
M	BERTIE	Don't say that!
M	LIONEL	I see. For reasons you cannot disclose, fearing ramifications you will not explain, you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith? You already owe me a shilling.
M	BERTIE	I brought it along. You won, fair and square. I'll pay you generously. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 48.
M	LIONEL	I'll continue to ask questions.
M	BERTIE	That's what I was afraid of.
M	LIONEL	Nice job.
M	BERTIE	You've someone waiting?
M	LIONEL	I do now.
M	BERTIE	I'd apologize to them in person, but...
M	LIONEL	You don't wish to be seen? Slip out the back way.
M	BERTIE	After the funeral...it may be even more difficult. To remain unobserved.
M	LIONEL	You're having second thoughts.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	I ask too many questions?
M	BERTIE	Perhaps the wrong sort.
M	LIONEL	We live in South Kensington, small apartment, but no one would see you. Lots of planes.
M	BERTIE	You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
M	LIONEL	Australian. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 49.
M	BERTIE	...I've ever really talked to. Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see a `bloke' I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine. Cuts both ways.
M	LIONEL	And if you decide to come, bring the Duchess. She might be helpful.
M	BERTIE	She might. If I asked. Very nicely. And how will Myrtle take to our coming into your home?
M	LIONEL	Not sure. She isn't speaking to me. Wants to go home. After the funeral then?
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	How're you doing, Willie?
M	WILLIE'S MUM	Still can't say a sentence.
M	LIONEL	Willie?
M	WILLIE	Iiiiiii'm much bbbbbbbetter.
M	LIONEL	Well done.
M	DIGNITARY	Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call to His mercy our late Sovereign, King George the Fifth of blessed and glorious memory...
M	DIGNITARY (CONT'D)	...that the High and Mighty Prince Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David is now become our only lawful King.
M	COSMO LANG (O.C.)	Oh bloody Hell!
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.C.)	A bad omen, Your Grace?
M	COSMO LANG	Don't be disingenuous. For our late King's crown to fall from his coffin is not a fortuitous portent. What ever is going to happen next? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 51.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Is that be the motto of the new reign? Indeed, will there actually be "a new reign"?
M	COSMO LANG	Winston! I'm deeply shocked.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	You don't look it.
M	COSMO LANG	My function requires me to appear serene.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	That may be increasingly difficult to maintain. I've been informed by no less an authority than the Prime Minister that our populace has no objection to Royal fornication, but will never tolerate adultery.
M	COSMO LANG	Well, since we cannot acquire a new populace, perhaps we need a new King?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	My turn to be profoundly shocked.
M	COSMO LANG	Scoff, Churchill! Go on... scoff! But you more than others know full well we'll soon be under siege from the forces of darkness.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	The winds of war...a gathering storm?
M	COSMO LANG	Oh, you do have a way with words. And who would you suggest to rally the troops, the nation, the Empire, the world?
M	COSMO LANG (CONT'D)	A man who cannot speak? In Nuremberg stadium, Herr Hitler mesmerizes millions, whilst the Duke of York cannot successfully order fish and chips. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 52.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Would you prefer the next brother?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	A bi-sexual former drug addict? The unwashed moralistic populace will adore that!
M	COSMO LANG	The youngest, perhaps?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Now there's dimness.
M	COSMO LANG	I must admit...unburdened with brain.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Thus we're left with David, the rightful heir, who speaks beautifully, even if he talks nonsense.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	Come, let us bury one king, before we attempt to bring another to his knees.
M	DAVID	Hear you're taking elocution lessons, lad.
M	BERTIE	Pardon?
M	DAVID	Diction. Speechifying. That's the word around Town.
M	BERTIE	Merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment... I'm the brother who speaks. Or do you wish to have a go?
M	BERTIE	Good lord no! I hope to...
M	DAVID	Replace me? Well...today's your chance.
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	My brother will read the Coronation Plans.
M	BERTIE	I'm not prepared!
M	DAVID	As a Boy Scout...and you are one, aren't you, very much a Boy Scout...you must always be prepared. Nice and loud, so everyone can hear.
M	BERTIE	I...I...I thu-thu-think we should tuh-tuh- table the document.
M	DAVID	Tell the others how Mrs Simpson is to be accommodated in a special alcove above the altar. Now I'll be off. See you at Balmoral this weekend, Buh-buh-Bertie.
M	BERTIE	Wait down the road.
M	LOCAL LAD	Kick it `ere, aye, Guv?
M	LOCAL LAD (CONT'D)	Nice one.
M	LIONEL	To be honest, wasn't sure whether to expect you.
M	BERTIE	I wasn't sure either. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 55.
M	LIONEL	Something happened?
M	BERTIE	Do I look like a spy?
M	LIONEL	With a toothache.
M	BERTIE	I was totally unable to speak.
M	LIONEL	You seldom stutter with me anymore. The boys are a bit untidy.
M	BERTIE	Because you're paid to listen!
M	LIONEL	Like a verbal geisha girl?
M	LIONEL	Home.
M	BERTIE	What more does a man need,eh?
M	LIONEL	Coming from a man who's lived all his life in castles and palaces. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 56.
M	BERTIE	Somebody has to live in them.
M	LIONEL	Somebody does.
M	BERTIE	I couldn't say anything!
M	LIONEL	You could've refused. Don't you know any rude words?
M	BERTIE	What a bloody stupid question! I just said one. Bloody. Bloodybloodybloody!
M	LIONEL	Perhaps a touch more vulgar?
M	BERTIE	Certainly not.
M	LIONEL	To prove you know how.
M	BERTIE	Bugger!
M	LIONEL	A public school prig could do better.
M	BERTIE	Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard!
M	LIONEL	Hardly robust.
M	BERTIE	Shit then. Shit, shit, shit!
M	LIONEL	See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? You don't stutter when you swear. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 57.
M	BERTIE	Because I'm angry!
M	LIONEL	Get angry more often. Do you know the f- word?
M	BERTIE	Fornication?
M	LIONEL	Oh Bertie...
M	BERTIE	Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!
M	LIONEL	Bravissimo! Now a resounding chorus of...
M	BERTIE	Bloody, bloody. bloody! Shit, shit, shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
M	MYRTLE (O.S.)	We have children...!
M	BERTIE	This is your fault!
M	LIONEL	Sorry, pet! Won't happen again!
M	MYRTLE (O.S.)	I should hope not!
M	BERTIE	Apologies, Mrs. Logue.
M	LIONEL	First time I've heard you laugh.
M	BERTIE	Royals aren't allowed emotions in public.
M	LIONEL	Which explains a lot. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 58. What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?!
M	LIONEL	Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed.
M	BERTIE	Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous man, Logue. Who sent you?
M	LIONEL	Anyone in mind?
M	BERTIE	The lurking shadows. Courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased.
M	LIONEL	Your wife was the one who sought me out.
M	BERTIE	Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me!
M	LIONEL	But you don't share her belief? Why come here?
M	BERTIE	I'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue.
M	LIONEL	Lionel.
M	BERTIE	I came here because I was taught from childhood to serve a purpose, and that purpose is to serve. Duty is our sole justification for privilege. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 59. I came here because I was under the illusion you might help me perform that function!
M	LIONEL	Not to worry. They say the King can do no wrong.
M	BERTIE	He can bugger things up! And I am not the King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce. The Coronation is set for the 12th of May. Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April. That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest.
M	LIONEL	And if Mr Baldwin stops them?
M	BERTIE	That would be a tragedy. I pray to The Almighty they succeed. I'll do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.
M	LIONEL	Does that include debasing yourself?
M	BERTIE	If necessary!
M	LIONEL	Your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning...
M	BERTIE	Are you saying he wanted me to fail?
M	LIONEL	Are you insisting he didn't? In the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases. You can sing them, swear them, rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow; that, combined with your growing confidence...
M	BERTIE	Growing confidence? Growing dread!!! You're a wicked man, Lionel Logue, trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother. Trying to get me to commit treason! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 60. Trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear. Again, why did you seek me out? To take polite elocution lessons so you could attend posh tea parties?!
M	BERTIE	How dare you! I'm the brother of a King...the son of a King...back through untold centuries. You presume to instruct me on my duty? A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback? The disappointing son of an embittered clerk! You're a monster, Doctor Logue. I'm going to Balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother. And these sessions are over!
M	LIONEL (BEHIND CURTAIN)	Now?
M	DIRECTOR	Were you told? We aren't for London. Playing the provinces.
M	LIONEL	Outer Mongolia?
M	DIRECTOR	Available, are we?
M	LIONEL	Nothing prevents.
M	DIRECTOR	I believe that's called "desperate for a part!" Previous experience?
M	LIONEL	Australia.
M	DIRECTOR	You have played the provinces. Righto! Let's hear what you can do. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 61.
M	LIONEL	Caliban?
M	DIRECTOR	Make him deformed. Audiences like that.
M	LIONEL	Of course. "Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not." "Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices..."
M	DIRECTOR	Thank you! Don't abandon your day job. Next!
M	LIONEL	You may leave.
M	VALENTINE	Haven't finished yet, Dad. Oh! Right!
M	THE BOYS	Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mum.
F	MYRTLE	Lionel? Tickets? Home?
M	LIONEL	First class.
F	MYRTLE	What about your...
M	LIONEL	Willie's a problem...not much progress. The others have been referred.
F	MYRTLE	What'll you do when we get home?
M	LIONEL	Try not to act the toff. Teach perhaps.
F	MYRTLE	You could...
M	LIONEL	No! I'm not good enough!
F	MYRTLE	You gave it a try, Lionel.
M	LIONEL	Yes, I had a go. Thanks to your patience. I just bloody well wasn't good enough!
F	MYRTLE	Oh Lionel! This must've cost you. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 63.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Five hundred year old oaks! Part of the hill! Removed to improve the view!
M	COSMO LANG	How ever does she do it?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination? I realize of course, that may be outside your personal experience.
M	COSMO LANG	You've the Devil in you today.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	If anyone should know, it would be Your Grace.
M	COSMO LANG	All aspects of mankind are within my venue. Did you know, HM has trouble with his glands?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	I'd not appreciated Your Grace was so well versed concerning things testicular!
M	COSMO LANG	They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 64.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	A veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information.
M	COSMO LANG	Apparently it affects the quality, although not the quantity, of HM's endeavors.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	And the brother?
M	COSMO LANG	Unscathed. Two daughters. I shepherd my flock in all matters, Winston, including multiplication.
M	BERTIE	We must try to be pleasant.
F	ELIZABETH	Your father not dead six months, and That Woman throws, "A garden potty." P-o-t-t-y. She's sleeping in your mother's bedroom. And I know perfectly well she calls me `the Dowdy Duchess", and "Cookie".
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Has it occurred to you, as it has only occurred to me, that a Monarch with a gland problem, who realizes he cannot produce issue, might not wish to be King...? knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed.
M	COSMO LANG	A dazzling concept...beautifully phrased. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 65. Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
F	ELIZABETH	I came at the invitation of the King.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	According to the F.B.I.... she is, after all, one of their citizens...our Monarch does not possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's sexual favours. Hitler's Ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, has been sending her 17 carnations every day...one for each time they've slept together.
M	COSMO LANG	Good Lord, Winston, we must see to it this Empress of the Night does not become Queen of England!
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Vividly put.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	Allow me to test new waters.
F	ELIZABETH	I don't need to be told I behaved badly.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	On the contrary, Mam. Court etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host. In this case: the King. You behaved impeccably. As always. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 66.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	A relative?
F	ELIZABETH	Distant.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	You're well aware, of course, George IV's wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common indeed...and previously married. She signed an agreement that she could never become Queen, and their children could not be Royal. A rather sensible morganatic arrangement.
F	ELIZABETH	That was a very long time ago. You're stirring with a rather large spoon, Winston. Keep in mind, I'm also a distant relative of Lady Macbeth.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	I would disremember at my peril.
M	BERTIE	David...
M	DAVID	Wally wants more champagne. I have to fetch it. She prefers that.
M	BERTIE	Been trying to see you...
M	DAVID	Been terribly busy.
M	BERTIE	Doing what?
M	DAVID	Being King. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 67.
M	BERTIE	Where did you get that American accent? David...Father's not dead six months, yet you've put Mrs. Simpson in the suite used by our mother?
M	DAVID	Mama's not still in bed, is she?
M	BERTIE	That isn't funny.
M	DAVID	Ssssssorry, d-d-dear b-b-oy!
M	BERTIE	Please. No more of that.
M	DAVID	Didn't realize you cared.
M	BERTIE	This could end in disaster.
M	DAVID	This will end splendidly. With Wallis as my wife.
M	BERTIE	Whatever will she call herself?
M	DAVID	Queen of England, I suspect. Kings do marry. Empress of India. The whole bag of tricks.
M	BERTIE	David! The upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous. Hunger marchers are singing the "Red Flag" in front of Westminster...demanding a republic...I've seen them...
M	DAVID	Herr Hitler will sort that out.
M	BERTIE	Who'll sort out Chancellor Hitler? 68.
M	DAVID	He's much maligned. By the Jews, according to Wallis. And she's very clever about politics.
M	BERTIE	The man's a monster! Our position must remain clear.
M	DAVID	Why's that, old chap?
M	BERTIE	We are a German family!
M	DAVID	Didn't bother anyone during WWI. And Kaiser Willie was our uncle.
M	BERTIE	Because we took an English name! Windsor. Because we are England. We are the heart and soul of this nation. That must never change.
M	DAVID	Are you already in charge?
M	BERTIE	I'm trying to warn you.
M	DAVID	Am I being threatened?
M	BERTIE	David, your role is to consult and to be advised.
M	DAVID	Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
M	BERTIE	Sounds like you haven't.
M	DAVID	I won't be a lackey to an unwashed politician like Stanley Baldwin!
M	BERTIE	He's your Prime Minister.
M	DAVID	And I'm his King! 69.
M	BERTIE	If you refuse to listen to our Government, they have no choice but to resign.
M	DAVID	I'll form another. There's Winston. He'd love to be P.M. We'll create a King's Party.
M	BERTIE	To fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic?
M	DAVID	I'd risk anything and everything for Wallis. Don't I have rights?
M	BERTIE	Privileges.
M	DAVID	Not the same thing.
M	BERTIE	No.
M	DAVID	Yet an ordinary man may marry for love.
M	BERTIE	We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred to be profiles on a coin. If you were ordinary, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
M	DAVID	What's the point then? Just to look posh? You know...your speech is much improved tonight. Hardly a hesitation. Yearning for a larger audience, are we?
M	BERTIE	Don't say such a thing!
M	DAVID	Is my young brother trying to push me off the throne? Sounds positively medieval.
M	BERTIE	I beg of you, don't do this to my wife, my daughters, to me. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 70.
M	DAVID	The politicians will give in. See you at my Coronation...Bertie.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.)	Nice of you to invite me to your digs, Stanley.
M	BALDWIN	As you may have guessed...
M	BALDWIN (CONT'D)	...I intend to resign. The Royal scandal has weakened my position considerably.
M	BALDWIN (CONT'D)	No need to volunteer your services, Winston. Neville Chamberlain will take my place, once this Royal matter is settled. As Chancellor of the Exchequer he already lives next door.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	My opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough, Stanley.
M	BALDWIN	Will it? Well, enough chit-chat. The question of a morganatic marriage, as a possible solution, has been put to the Dominion Prime Ministers. After all, HM is their King too. Australia: no.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	David feels there aren't that many people in Australia.
M	BALDWIN	Canada: no. Union of South Africa: an inappropriate marriage would create a permanent wound. The Irish Free State: states it is not really their affair, and, bluntly, our English King may marry any whore he wants, they'll be well out of it.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Bloody Irish.
M	BALDWIN	New Zealand...wavers.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Ah, the Kiwis!
M	BALDWIN	Being rather remote, they've not even heard of Mrs Simpson. Hardly a winning hand.
M	BALDWIN (CONT'D)	This is not about true love, Winston. This is about who's in charge. Does the King do what he wants, or what his people want him to do? Does the King own his nation, or does the nation own their Monarch?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	He won't budge.
M	BALDWIN	Nor will we.
M	BERTIE	Don't dismount. 72.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Good of you to see me at this late hour.
M	BERTIE	Thought you were in David's camp?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	I was. "I am now free to tell you how I was jockeyed out of the Throne."
M	BERTIE	Good Lord! My brother wrote that?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Wallis wrote it for him. I'll burn it. I fear your brother is like the child in a fairy story, given everything in the world, but they forgot his soul. Quite happy to bring his nation to the brink of civil war just as we face global conflict.
M	BERTIE	We're not coming to that?!
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Oh, there'll be war, alright. Your brother held conversations with the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, your cousin, a ranking member of the Nazi party. I have the Scotland Yard intercept: "Who is King here? Baldwin or I? I myself wish to talk with Hitler, and will do so here or in Germany." I doubt England is ready to return to absolute monarchy.
M	BERTIE	Surely his motives are misunderstood?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	"If I don't get my way, when the war comes, Hitler will crush everyone, including the Americans. The British may not want me as their King, but I'll soon be back as their leader." His intent seems crystal clear.
M	BERTIE	Winston?! Don't take him seriously! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 73.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Mugs for his cancelled Coronation will soon be on clearance sale.
M	BERTIE	You're willing to go along with this?! Changing horses in mid-stream is a perilous maneuver!!!
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Depends how badly the horse you're on stumbles.
M	BERTIE	It's not too late, Winston, you could form a government on his behalf.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	I must decline. Reluctantly.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	Sorry. I've written a new speech for him.
M	BERTIE	I don't want to hear it! Ever!
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	It does have a rather nice turn of phrase.
M	DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)	At long last I am able to say a few words of my own. Until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak. A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 74.
M	DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)	Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
M	MARGARET ROSE	Daddy, who broke our rocking horse?
M	BERTIE	A giant. the sure knowledge that my brother has one matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of you, and not bestowed on me -- a happy home with his wife and children.
M	DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)	I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
M	DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D)	We all have a new King. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all! God save the King!
M	LIONEL	I too "married the woman I love." 75.
F	MYRTLE	You married a shop girl.
M	LIONEL	A wonderful lass. Someone I can talk to heart to heart.
F	MYRTLE	Using simple words and short sentences. I'm very ordinary.
M	LIONEL	That's why we're suited. I'm just an ordinary bloke.
F	MYRTLE	Ordinary? You're a man with wild dreams, Lionel. Mine are so very small. A job, a husband, a home. Raising our sons. That's all I ever wanted.
M	LIONEL	Me too.
F	MYRTLE	Is that why, every day, you've spent hours with a man who's about to be King?
M	LIONEL	That relationship is now past tense.
F	MYRTLE	Yet, for as long as you could, you did what you wanted.
M	LIONEL	I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I wanted.
F	MYRTLE	And failing that...
M	LIONEL	I certainly failed!
F	MYRTLE	A great healer. Always...'great'. Where does a shop girl fit in?
M	LIONEL	Very snugly, into my heart! Always have, always will. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 76.
F	MYRTLE	Trouble is, Lionel, when you say that, I still believe it.
M	BERTIE	Where's the Austin?
M	DRIVER	The Palace changed it, Your Highness.
M	BERTIE	I liked the Austin.
M	DRIVER	So did I, sir.
M	MARGARET ROSE	You look like a chicken.
M	LILIBET	A rooster.
M	MASTER OF THE COUNCIL (O.S.)	His Majesty will address the Accession Council and take his oath.
M	BERTIE	How did this happen to you? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 77.
M	BERTIE	My Lords, members of the Accession Council, I meet you today in circumstances which are without parallel in the history of our Country...
M	BERTIE	Daddy's home.
M	LILIBET & MARGARET ROSE	Your Majesty.
M	BERTIE	I don't want to lose you.
F	ELIZABETH	How could you possibly?
M	BERTIE	Being what we both dread most. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 78.
F	ELIZABETH	Dear, dear, man, I refused your first two marriage proposals because, as much as I loved you, I couldn't abide the thought of living in the Royal gilded cage. Then I realized...you stuttered so beautifully...they'd leave you alone.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	If I must be Queen, I will be a good Queen. The wife of a very great King indeed. You know what you must do.
M	ANNA	"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths Enwrought with golden and silver light, The bbb..."
M	LIONEL	We haven't much more time together. Give it a go.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	There weren't any more appointments today.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Piss off! Anna?
M	ANNA	"The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light..." "I would spread the cloths under your feet, But I, being poor, have only my dreams. I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."
M	LIONEL	Read it to him. If he doesn't profess his love, he's not a man.
M	ANNA	Thank you...Lionel.
M	BERTIE	That was lovely. Don't take any guff.
M	ANNA	Can I tell my Harold that's what you said?
M	BERTIE	I'd be honoured.
M	LIONEL	Johnson, isn't it? Have you an appointment?
M	BERTIE	Want me to beg?
M	LIONEL	I told you, Kings don't beg.
M	BERTIE	I believe this time a bit of begging might be required. Elizabeth says I must eat humble crow.
M	LIONEL	Its "crow" or "humble pie". Take your pick. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 80.
M	BERTIE	I was frightened and took refuge in being `Royal'. What I said was unforgivable. And...
M	LIONEL	And?
M	BERTIE	What's the one essential thing a King must do? He must believe he is King. How can I possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I beg you: get me through! I'll pay you another shilling.
M	LIONEL	What're friends for?
M	BERTIE	I wouldn't know.
F	MYRTLE	I've got the boys sorting their things. Your office will be a chore...
M	COSMO LANG	We asked to see Your Highness because there's the urgent question of what to call your brother. Aside from the obvious. What do you suggest?
M	COSMO LANG	Mr. Edward Windsor? All he deserves.
M	BERTIE	What has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne?
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke. Which makes him a Lord at the very least.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Very well, Lord E.W. it is.
M	BERTIE	And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons. Heading a King's Party.
M	COSMO LANG	Unacceptable!
M	BERTIE	So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's Party? Is that acceptable?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Certainly not.
M	BERTIE	But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords.
M	COSMO LANG	Oh I say...
M	BERTIE	The Duke of Windsor it is. Gentlemen.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Not exactly a dummy, is he?
M	BERTIE (O. S.)	"Let's go gathering hearty heather with the gay brigade of grand dragons."
M	LIONEL	Splendid. Here's another. "She sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves." At home, twenty-five times, in rapid succession.
M	BERTIE	Those are my hardest sounds.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	Oh.
M	LIONEL	Shall we invite your wife in now? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 83. I wasn't expecting Myrtle for several hours!
F	MYRTLE	Milady?
F	ELIZABETH	"Your Majesty", the first time. After that, "Ma'am". Not Malm as in Palm, Mam as in ham. I'm informed your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel. I trust, however, you won't attempt to call me Liz.
M	BERTIE	How're they getting on?
M	LIONEL	As to be expected.
F	MYRTLE	You may call me "Madam Logue".
M	MYRTLE (CONT'D)	May I offer you a cup of tea, Ma'am?
F	ELIZABETH	Thank you, Madame Logue, but I'm waiting to be summoned.
F	MYRTLE	You don't like my husband. That's what I was told.
F	ELIZABETH	I was told the same.
M	THE STUDY:	TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 84.
M	BERTIE	Do we remain in hiding?
M	LIONEL	I'm not going out there!
F	MYRTLE	What do you dislike about my Lionel?
F	ELIZABETH	I don't wish my husband to be demeaned. What don't you like about mine?
F	MYRTLE	I don't want my Lionel getting hurt.
F	ELIZABETH	There's only one thing can save him now: success.
M	BERTIE	We're being cowards.
M	LIONEL	Of course. We're sensible men.
M	BERTIE	You should go in.
M	LIONEL	Me? You.
M	BERTIE	Why me?!
M	LIONEL	You're the Royal.
M	BERTIE	Being a monarchist, I recognize these are your digs. Therefore: here you rule. Therefore: you go in.
M	LIONEL	Oh! Hello, Lady Elizabeth! Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! What a pleasant surprise.
F	MYRTLE	Will the Yorks be staying for dinner?
F	ELIZABETH	A previous engagement.
M	LIONEL	Some other time, love.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Good of you to come.
F	ELIZABETH	Harley Street is far too public. What is my function here?
M	LIONEL	For me to show you how to pitch in.
F	ELIZABETH	Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type.
M	LIONEL	Piece of cake. Please assume a supine position on the floor.
F	ELIZABETH	What?! Firm support is needed. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 86.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now your stomach...deep into the diaphragm. Splendid. How do you feel?
M	BERTIE	Full of hot air.
M	LIONEL	Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker. Again...
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach.
F	ELIZABETH	Good grief.
M	LIONEL	Gently of course.
F	ELIZABETH	Are you alright, Bertie?
M	LIONEL	Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm...and...up comes Princess Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff. Now comes the fun part.
F	ELIZABETH	There's actually more?
M	LIONEL	You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds. There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer.
F	ELIZABETH	Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On a public street?
M	LIONEL	Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech.
F	ELIZABETH	They can also be considered quite dotty. Don't even contemplate it!
M	BERTIE	Sorry, dear, doctor's orders. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... She's right, those two chaps are staring at me.
F	ELIZABETH	They're always looking at you.
M	LIONEL	You're followed?
F	ELIZABETH	Royal scrutiny, Doctor, best get used to it.
M	BERTIE	...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... Are you timing this? iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... ooooooooooooooooooooooooo... uuuuuuuuuuu.
M	The family eat in tense silence	TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 88.
M	VALENTINE	May we be excused?
M	LIONEL	No.
M	PETER	We don't want to hear you fight.
M	LIONEL	We're not fighting. Your mother isn't talking.
F	MYRTLE	You wish me to speak my mind?
M	LIONEL	Boys, leave.
M	THE BOYS	Thank you, Dad! Thank you, Mum!
F	MYRTLE	Lionel...without warning, I arrive home to find the Queen in my parlour.
M	LIONEL	A Duchess, she hasn't been crowned yet.
F	MYRTLE	Lionel, don't quibble!
M	LIONEL	What'd you think of her?
F	MYRTLE	Does it matter!? She's the Queen and he's the King forgodsake! What're they doing here?!
M	LIONEL	Why'd you come home so early?
F	MYRTLE	Lionel...
M	LIONEL	They came for help. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 89.
F	MYRTLE	What role are you auditioning for now? Royal saviour?! Who's going to help us?! This will bring us down, Lionel. You know it will.
M	LIONEL	When that poor chap first walked into my office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual speech defect has set the sign. You saw him today; once more there was hope.
F	MYRTLE	You're not listening to me!
M	LIONEL	Myrtle, I love you.
F	MYRTLE	You say that, but you don't listen when I say, in so many ways, how desperately I want to go home, how I never, ever, intended to stay here. This was to be a holiday trip to see `Mother England', and you turned it into quite something else. What happened, Lionel? We went to Wembley Stadium, next thing...you'd cashed in our tickets.
M	MYRTLE (CONT'D)	Very well, I shan't talk of this ever again. I will, as always, be supportive of your endeavours.
M	LIONEL	Myrtle... I don't deserve a wonderful woman like you.
F	MYRTLE	How right you are.
M	LIONEL	But why'd you come home so early?
F	MYRTLE	Lionel...I was let go. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 90.
M	MYRTLE (CONT'D)	Inquiries were made...Mr Falkoff wouldn't say who...afterwards it was: `With your hubby treating a personage that high and mighty, you won't be needing employment with us, will you, Mrs Logue?'
M	LIONEL	Why?!
F	MYRTLE	They're frightened, Lionel. Of what seems so far above them. I sympathize. I'm frightened too.
M	LIONEL	Oh, Myrtle. My love...
M	COSMO LANG (O.S.)	Winston, you do read the newspapers?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Only the vulgar ones.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)	To our new King.
M	COSMO LANG	Let's sincerely hope.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Is this a `slightly pregnant pause'? 91.
M	COSMO LANG	They say he is dim.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Demonstrably untrue.
M	COSMO LANG	They say he has epilepsy.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Patently erroneous.
M	COSMO LANG	Fragile, prone to illness...
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Some correctness in that.
M	COSMO LANG	...and will die prematurely. They predict he'll be unable to complete the Coronation.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	What do you propose? Shorten the ceremony? Or no ceremony at all?
M	COSMO LANG	My idea exactly! I believed so. But what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world.
M	COSMO LANG	What we need, and what we'll get, may be two rather different things. Did you hear his pathetic attempt at the Accession Council? He'll never be able to speak in public.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet? Who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war? Who will address the far flung corners of the Empire, rallying all to our defense?
M	COSMO LANG	Well...
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	The Head of our Church? Is that what you have in mind? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 92.
M	COSMO LANG	Would it be such a calamity?
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Best ask our new King.
M	COSMO LANG	Your Majesty.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Excuse me, sir, duty calls.
M	BERTIE	Is this the scene of the crime?
M	COSMO LANG	What a peculiar thing to say.
M	BERTIE	Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners.
M	COSMO LANG	Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box. I have, however, categorically said no to the BBC's new "radio-with-pictures" gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms.
M	BERTIE	Radio with pictures?!
M	COSMO LANG	It is called..."television". Happily, with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this "TV" thing has no future. We shall, however, be forced to permit cinema; the product of which I shall personally edit.
M	BERTIE	That'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts.
M	COSMO LANG	Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet ceremony? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 93. What exactly do you mean?
M	COSMO LANG	Something...discreet...private. We could pre-record an edited version to be broadcast to the world. Or even find an actor with a similar voice.
M	LIONEL	A King based upon deception?
M	COSMO LANG	If your gentleman from Security would give us space, we could discuss this in private.
M	BERTIE	You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?"
M	COSMO LANG	Fret not. As I assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech. But to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks." You see, I've paved the way. But should you wish to avoid further stress...
M	LIONEL	Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins?
M	COSMO LANG	Pardon?!
M	LIONEL	If you wish to call attention to his anxiety.
M	COSMO LANG	Does your bodyguard know to whom he's speaking? He certainly doesn't know his place! 94.
M	BERTIE	Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist.
M	COSMO LANG	Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance I would've made my own recommendation.
M	BERTIE	Dr. Logue is to be present at the Coronation.
M	COSMO LANG	Impossibly to find room. Even for a Doctor.
M	LIONEL	Just Lionel.
M	BERTIE	Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor.
M	COSMO LANG	The Royal Box!? Your Family will be seated there.
M	BERTIE	Which makes it most suitable.
M	COSMO LANG	Perhaps I might be able to add a very small stool.
M	BERTIE	Two comfortable chairs. One for Madam Logue. She's a close friend of my wife. The Queen.
M	COSMO LANG	I'll have someone attend to it.
M	LIONEL	And now, if you don't mind, we need the premises.
M	COSMO LANG	My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey! The Church must make preparations.
M	LIONEL	So must Bertie.
M	COSMO LANG	Bertie?! We do not call the King: "Bertie"! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 95. I do. During waking hours we'll need the facilities. It'll be a closed set. No observers.
M	BERTIE	Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	You've made a dangerous enemy.
M	LIONEL	Wouldn't want him as a friend.
M	BERTIE	And don't ever call me Bertie in public.
M	LIONEL	Tell me...
M	BERTIE	I sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon.
M	LIONEL	Do you really want to be King?
M	BERTIE	Knew it! I haven't any choice.
M	LIONEL	You can be a wounded King who stumbles through his Coronation. Or, as the Arch of C so archly suggests, no Coronation at all. Always a choice.
M	BERTIE	What's this, you wait til Westminster Abbey, then ambush me?
M	LIONEL	I'm simply asking questions... which you seem unable to answer.
M	BERTIE	I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter! Damn you! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 96.
M	LIONEL	Quite possibly. But at least I know what I want. You haven't the foggiest.
M	BERTIE	I WANT TO BE HEARD!
M	LIONEL	That's quite different. Let's get down to work then, shall we?
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me." You won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	You'll then show yourself to the various sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop announces four times in a loud voice, "Sirs, I here present unto you..." Have you decided your name for when you become King? For when you become a different person?
M	BERTIE	George.
M	LIONEL	Like your father?
M	BERTIE	Like my father.
M	LIONEL	Not Albert?
M	BERTIE	Given the current situation...too Germanic.
M	LIONEL	"Sirs, I here present unto you, GEORGE, your undoubted King!" TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 97.
M	COSMO LANG	I've made inquiries.
F	MYRTLE	A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm.
M	LIONEL	Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely.
F	MYRTLE	You look done in.
M	LIONEL	I've news for you. You're coming to the Coronation.
F	MYRTLE	I've news for you. I'm not!
M	LIONEL	You must.
F	MYRTLE	Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse?
M	LIONEL	Royal Box. You and I.
F	MYRTLE	Lionel...I'd need a new dress.
M	LIONEL	Rather thought you might. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 98. Dad! Phone! For you!
M	LIONEL	Won't be a sec.
M	COSMO LANG	"The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of a King."
M	LIONEL	Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...?
M	BERTIE	This is not a rehearsal, "Doctor" Logue. 99.
M	LIONEL	Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I wondered when that would happen. And I'd promised Myrtle a new frock.
M	BERTIE	"Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve.
M	LIONEL	Want to hear my side of the story?
M	BERTIE	There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life!
M	LIONEL	Wembley Stadium...
M	BERTIE	You dare remind me?!
M	LIONEL	I was there.
M	BERTIE	Then you knew from the start I was hopeless?!
M	LIONEL	My son, Valentine, asked, "Could you help that poor man?" I replied, "He's too old for me to manage a complete cure, but I could very nearly do it, I'm sure of that."
M	BERTIE	Lying bastard!
M	LIONEL	I knew I could help you. You refuse to believe?
M	BERTIE	In you?! 100.
M	LIONEL	In yourself.
M	BERTIE	Who the hell do you think you are?!
M	LIONEL	A failed actor.
M	BERTIE	Actor?
M	LIONEL	Father wanted me to be a doctor, but I couldn't cut flesh. So I worked in the mines, recited in pubs...
M	BERTIE	An actor?!
M	LIONEL	When the war came, by the time I was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest. Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I found I had to go deeper, as you might well imagine.
M	BERTIE	I know nothing of those poor men!
M	LIONEL	I think you do. They had cried out, and the universe had not listened. So they'd lost faith in their voice. My job was to make them shout in righteous anger: "I have the right to be heard!"
M	BERTIE	I suppose that helped them, did it?
M	LIONEL	Make inquiries.
M	BERTIE	Inquiries have been made! No credentials.
M	LIONEL	But a lot of success. No training was given. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 101.
M	LIONEL (CONT'D)	Not in Western Australia, not at that time. I simply knew what to do. When the war was over I kept being a therapist to earn a living. When the lads were old enough, I thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go." I pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.
M	BERTIE	To Harley Street?!
M	LIONEL	Cashed in our return tickets. I had three months rent.
M	BERTIE	So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor? Harley Street, don't you know, is for doctors!
M	LIONEL	The plaque says, `L. Logue. Speech Specialist'. No mention of a medical degree. No mention of any degree. Some of the diggers I'd helped had come to England. They made referrals. My practice flourished. My acting, however, did not.
M	BERTIE	Well enough to deceive me.
M	LIONEL	Lock me in the Tower.
M	BERTIE	I would if I could!
M	LIONEL	What crime?
M	BERTIE	You've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King. Destroyed the happiness of my family...all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist! What're you doing? Get up! 102.
M	LIONEL	I'm tired.
M	BERTIE	You can't sit there!
M	LIONEL	Why not? It's a chair.
M	BERTIE	It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor! The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned.
M	LIONEL	It's falling apart. People have carved their initials into it. Needs a stone to keep from blowing away.
M	BERTIE	That's the Stone of Scone! The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow.
M	LIONEL	You believe such ballocks I don't care how many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a building block with handles attached. You're just like me, an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real.
M	BERTIE	Listen to me... !
M	LIONEL	Listen to you?! By what right?
M	BERTIE	Divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
M	LIONEL	Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself. Said you didn't want it. So why should I listen to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put one word after another? Why waste my time listening to you?
M	BERTIE	Because I have a right to be heard!
M	LIONEL	Heard as what?!
M	BERTIE	A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 103.
M	LIONEL	Well then...you're cured.
M	BERTIE	Stop trying to squirm off the hook.
M	LIONEL	Bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. And you know it.
M	VOICE	Your Majesty?
M	COSMO LANG	You'll be relieved to learn I've found a replacement specialist. Impeccable credentials.
M	BERTIE	That won't be necessary.
M	COSMO LANG	The matter's already been settled. For your own well-being.
M	BERTIE	What did you say?
M	COSMO LANG	Your Majesty's function is to consult...and to be advised. You didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
M	BERTIE	Now I advise you, so listen carefully. ...in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
M	COSMO LANG	May I remind you, you do not place the crown upon your own head.
M	BERTIE	And may I remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 104.
M	COSMO LANG	This will end badly.
M	LIONEL	In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. And you are King!
M	COSMO LANG (O.S.)	I was much moved There were tears in my eyes too, Your Grace, particularly when I saw you and the Dean of Westminster cannoning into each other.
M	COSMO LANG (O.S.)	That's been edited.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.)	More tears when our new Monarch started towards his throne, only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops treading on his robe.
M	COSMO LANG (O.S.)	To the world, all went splendidly.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels, bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 105. Now, Winston, I have something which will bring tears to your eyes.
M	COSMO LANG (CONT'D)	There's no doubt: David is planning a comeback. And will succeed if our King continues to falter. Though Bertie miraculously survived the Coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed. Soon he must broadcast to the world. Hitler will be listening. David will be listening. Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening. Everyone will be listening. God help us.
M	BERTIE (V.O.)	"In this grave hour... "
M	BERTIE	"In this grave hour... " Sorry.
M	LIONEL	Try again.
M	BERTIE	"In this grave hour... "
M	LIONEL	Turn the halts into pauses, during which you say to yourself, "God save the King".
M	BERTIE	I say that all the time, but apparently no one's listening.
M	LIONEL	Use the silence. Long pauses add solemnity to great occasions.
M	BERTIE	Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived. Lionel, I can't do this! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 106.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	If I am to be King...where is my power? May I form a Government on my own, appoint or dismiss a Prime Minister, chose an Ambassador, levy a tax or declare a war? None of these things. Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak, I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!
M	LIONEL	Take it from the top. "In this grave hour..."
M	BERTIE	"In this grave hour, p-p-perhaps..."
M	LIONEL	Go on...
M	BERTIE	The letter`P' is always difficult.
M	LIONEL	Get a running start, put the words all together. `Perhaps-the-most-fateful...'
M	BERTIE	"In this grave hour...perhaps-the-most- fateful...in our history..."
M	LIONEL	Beaut.
M	BERTIE	"... I send to every household of my peoples...both at home and overseas..."
M	LIONEL (SINGS)	Doo-dah, doo-dah.
M	BERTIE	"...this message... " Five miles long... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 107.
M	BERTIE	"...spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you... as if I were able..."
M	LIONEL	In your head, now: "Bugger, bugger, bugger! Damn, damn, damn! All those bloody blighters are going to have to listen to me!" Can you dance?
M	BERTIE	What?
M	LIONEL	Helps relax the body. Waltz?
M	BERTIE	I prefer pipes.
M	LIONEL	Thought you might. Dance with me. One, two, one-two-three- four. One, two, one- two-three-four. "For the second time..." one-two-three-four "... in the lives of most of us..." one, two, one-two-three- four "... we are at war." Three, four.
M	BERTIE	"For the second time... in the lives of most of us... we are at war." One-two- "Over and over again... we have tried to find a peaceful way... out of the differences... between ourselves... and those who are now our enemies." Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
M	LIONEL	You'll be ready.
M	BERTIE	The shilling you won... still have it?
M	LIONEL	Of course. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 108.
M	BERTIE	I'll return it.
M	LIONEL	Willie! Where's your mum?
M	WILLIE	She had to work.
M	LIONEL	You've been waiting here, alone, all this time?
M	WILLIE	I heard the King.
M	LIONEL	Did you?
M	WILLIE	He sang. And shouted rude words.
M	LIONEL	He did. Would you like to sing, dance, and shout rude words?
M	WILLIE (NO STUTTER)	I would!
M	LIONEL	Why am I not surprised? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 109.
M	FLOOR MANAGER	Think he'll manage?
M	BBC NEWS READER	I've heard he may not even show.
M	BERTIE	`Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man.'
M	BBC NEWS READER	If you'll be so kind, to let me show you...
M	BERTIE	I already know. My father taught me.
M	BBC NEWS READER	His father taught him. I taught his father.
M	BERTIE	Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody bloody...
F	ELIZABETH	Bertie, do make sure that's not switched on!
M	LIONEL	You're going to be splendid. And if you're not?
M	BERTIE	They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway. Right? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 110. Bloody right.
F	ELIZABETH	Mr. Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of you to join us.
M	COSMO LANG	Wouldn't miss this for the world. Congratulations. Neville didn't last long, did he? Talking to Hitler.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	My tenure will be shorter, if the King fails tonight.
M	BERTIE	No matter how this turns out, I wish to thank you. For asking such dreadful questions. What can I do in recompense?
M	LIONEL	I've always wanted to be knighted.
M	BERTIE	Sorry. That would raise too many questions.
M	LIONEL	Understood.
M	BERTIE	Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back.
M	LIONEL	Keep it for good luck.
M	BERTIE	No, you won this, fair and square. Made from the melted coin. Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend. May I call you that?
M	LIONEL	My greatest honour, Bertie. One final question.
M	BERTIE	Oh dear.
M	LIONEL	Do you believe you're King?
M	BERTIE	Almost.
M	BBC NEWS READER	Good evening, this is the BBC National and World programme, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 112.
M	BERTIE (V.O. RADIO FILTER)	In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas... WORLD - NIGHT OR DAY, DEPENDING ON LOCATION
M	BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)	...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 113.
M	BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO) (CONT'D)	But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. This is the ultimate issue which confronts us.
M	BERTIE (CONT'D)	For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.
M	BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)	If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's help, we shall prevail. We may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which, in my closing words, I would like to say to you: `I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way.'" May the Almighty Hand guide and uphold us all.
M	BBC NEWS READER	This concludes the BBC broadcast of the King's Speech. He wasn't perfect. Not perfect... But by God... He moved me.
M	WINSTON CHURCHILL	Couldn't have said it better myself.
M	COSMO LANG	I'm speechless.
F	ELIZABETH	Thank God. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 115. Well done, Bertie. Well done... ...Lionel. Well done.
M	LIONEL	I always called you Bertie. Today, I call you King.
