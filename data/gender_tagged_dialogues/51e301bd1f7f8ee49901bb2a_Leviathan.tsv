M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	JONES	Burritos...Enchiladas...
M	DEJESUS	Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
F	BOWMAN	I can't wait for fresh vegetables...
M	BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO	Okay, cut the chatter. You're not out of here, yet. Who's the hook? Seven?...You got a hook on container 22?
M	SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO	The man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit.
M	JONES' VOICE/ RADIO	Watch your mouth, Sixpack. Hello, Shack, Seven, here. I ain't the hook, over.
M	WILLIE'S VOICE	Six to Shack. I'm the hook.
M	BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO	Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day.
M	SIXPACK'S VOICE	Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something? We're all waiting on you, honey.
F	WILLIE	Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you'll be inside before "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.
M	WILLIE'S VOICE	Six to Shack...Hook's on. Ready to winch.
M	BECK/ RADIO	Ok, that's it. Come on in.
M	DEJESUS	One thing stands clear...
M	JONES' VOICE(O.C.)	Mil-ler's tastes too good to hurry through...
M	DEJESUS	...beer after beer...
M	DEJESUS(cont'd)	Oh, shit...
M	JONES/ RADIO	Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.
M	DEJESUS	Jonesy! I'm losing compression... I'm going to blow my suit, man! Beck! Doc! Help me!...
M	BECK	Give me a readout, DeJesus.
M	DEJESUS(ON RADIO)	Ahhhh!
M	BECK (ON RADIO)	DeJesus! A readout!
M	JONES	He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
M	BECK(RADIO)	Stay calm!
F	BOWMAN	Calm!? Where's Doc?
M	BECK	The internal monitors read normal.
M	COBB	Where's Doc?!
M	BECK(RADIO)	He's not at his station.
M	DEJESUS	Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive me of my--
M	BECK'S VOICE	Get him into the Shack.
F	BOWMAN	I'm telling you, it's the suits!
M	JONES	Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
M	SIXPACK	And just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh? That would have been you, DeJesus... Yeah...I was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the Indian Ocean...little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit ...ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet. They just buried his helmet.
M	DEJESUS	I know all about implosion, man.
M	SIXPACK	Yeah, I bet you do. I bet you were imploding in your pants. Jonesy! Doc!...Help me! Help me!
M	BECK	Knock it off, Sixpack! I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart...
M	BECK	Shit...
M	JONES	Fuck the suits man...this place is going to kill us first.
M	DEJESUS	There it is again... Two more days. I tell myself 'you can make it two more days--'
F	BOWMAN	What's the weather like up top?
F	WILLIE	Clear for pickup.
M	JONES	Let's hope it holds.
M	COBB	Then what? Huh? Then what? You folks think going up top's the answer to all your problems. Well, it ain't.
F	BOWMAN	Give us a break, Cobb...
M	COBB	A break? You folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists. 'Know what you'd be doing if you were up there, right now?
M	SIXPACK	Eating pussy and drinking brew...
M	COBB	Eating pussy my ass. What about lines at the bank: What about getting stuck in traffic?
M	SIXPACK	Wherever I can find it.
M	COBB	Bullshit! I'll tell you what you'd be doing! You'd be watching news on TV that's so fucking bad it makes you nauseous. So you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and after you've been driving for five minutes you realize the air's so damn dirty you don't dare breath it! That's what you've got to look forward to...
M	COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)	...And if you're lucky enough to make it back home to your house that looks the fucking same as everyone else's, you'll find your wife's just as fat as she was when you left and the only reason your kids ain't strung out on the drugs they were using when you left is that they've found some new drugs which fuck 'em up even more!... You people just don't appreciate how good you've got down here...
M	BECK	Doc eat already?
M	JONES	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
M	BECK	How do you feel, DeJesus?
M	DEJESUS	Okay.
M	BECK	Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
M	SIXPACK	Yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him.
M	BECK	Cut it, Sixpack. Leave the Doc to me. I'm going to talk to him.
M	SIXPACK	'Makes me feel better already...
M	BECK	I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
M	JONES	Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
M	BECK	...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
M	COBB	No way, Mister Beck! No fucking way! We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift. It's a contract violation!
M	JONES	Whooo! Right on, Cobb! Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
M	SIXPACK	Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck? Company got to abide by the rules.
M	BECK	I know all about the contract. The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day. It's up to you.
M	DEJESUS	You giving us a day off?
M	COBB	What about our quota?
M	BECK	You're only twenty-five tons off quota. Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day. It's just a day off. You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
M	JONES	Count me in.
M	BECK	Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system... Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
M	SIXPACK	Shit...
M	BECK	Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics. Any other suit problems she should know about?
M	SIXPACK	My pocket. Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
F	WILLIE	Your pocket?
M	SIXPACK	The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
F	WILLIE	Right.
F	WILLIE	You did good...
M	BECK	What?
F	WILLIE	Today...with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside...
M	BECK	There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
F	WILLIE	Still...you did the right thing.
M	DOC	I must have dozed off. Snakebite medicine...Never pack my bag without it.
M	BECK	Are you planning on working tomorrow?
M	DOC	Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning. Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
M	BECK	We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
M	DOC	You got something to say to me, son?...
M	BECK	I...I think it's important to have the second officer on deck.
M	DOC	I'll keep it to nine holes in the morning.
M	SIXPACK	Christ...what a pair...
F	BOWMAN	What was that? What'd you say?
M	SIXPACK	I said, "What a pair" the boy wonder Shack Boss and his drunken doctor buddy make... Why? What did ya think I said?
M	JONES	Listen to it for Christsake.
M	COBB	Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here... You gonna sit there on your butt or give me a hand?
M	BECK	Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
F	MARTIN	Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night... You're good executive timber, Beck. A lot of management trainees wash out when they have to go under for their first tour. But you've done well.
M	BECK	Thank you, Martin.
F	MARTIN	Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
M	MARTIN(cont'd)	The one thing I've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends. It's the only way to survive.
F	WILLIE	Probably a short. Good guess, Williams. Piece of cake.
M	COBB	Okay, watch this..
M	JONES	So that's all you do?...
M	COBB	Shhhh...don't tell no one. Job security.
F	WILLIE	Nothing wrong with this...
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)	Fuck you, Sixpack! You think you're funny? You're not funny!
M	BECK	This is Beck. Is there a problem, Williams?
F	WILLIE	A little problem, sir...but I've got a handle on it now.
F	WILLIE	Made your million, yet?
F	BOWMAN	Not yet.
F	WILLIE	How's TransOcean doing?
F	BOWMAN	You got money in this tub?
F	WILLIE	I signed-up for the stock option.
M	DEJESUS	Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
M	COBB	Who cares?
M	DEJESUS	I do, man. That's a beautiful place. When I get out of here I'm going there. Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
M	DEJESUS	Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man? You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
M	COBB	This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
F	BOWMAN	"Major development in South Indian Ocean set for fall of 2010..." That sounds interesting, but they're too tied to their holdings. Remember a year ago when they lost that tanker?... The bottom fell out of their stock and I lost a bloody fortune. That's when I decided to diversify.
F	WILLIE	You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
F	BOWMAN	You're damn right I do. Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside. I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
M	SIXPACK'S VOICE(O.S.)	"Fun?" Somebody talking fun? Hey, Willie, honey...Sorry about that little incident tonight...Everyone's been so tight lately, I thought a little humor'd loosen us all up, you know?
F	WILLIE	Get out of here, Sixpack.
M	SIXPACK	I got a date with an angel...
M	JONES	be off that thing? I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
F	BOWMAN	The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
F	WILLIE	Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
M	JONES	Jameson? Who're you trying to con?
M	JONES	Hey, Hazy! We got a day off tomorrow, Kemosabi! Let's get shit-faced!
M	JONES(cont'd)	How about you, brother Cobb? Little Wild Turkey?
M	DEJESUS	No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way back. Ain't that right Cobbie?
M	COBB	You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
M	DEJESUS	What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
M	COBB	You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
M	DEJESUS	I'm on the way to the looney bin? Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
M	SIXPACK	Oh, Darlin'...come sit on my face...
M	SIXPACK	That bitch!
M	SIXPACK	Bitch! Look what you did!
F	WILLIE	Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
M	SIXPACK	You think you're so funny? Wait till you taste this!
M	BECK'S VOICE(O.S.)	That's enough!
M	SIXPACK	Look at my foot, sir! This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
M	BECK	How do you know it was Williams?
M	SIXPACK	Huh? I...uh...uh...
M	BECK	All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
M	SIXPACK AND WILLIE	Bullshit! What?! She...He...
M	BECK	At ease! You both have a half day...Anymore shit and its a full one.
M	JONES	Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the music.
M	COBB	What music? There ain't no music.
M	DEJESUS	Oooooh.
M	COBB	You know it's really crazy to pretend to be drunk, but it's fucking insane to pretend to have a hangover.
F	BOWMAN	Your "hangovers" made you miss the Sixpack Good Morning Show. "No goddamn boy is going to make me go out on a down day."
M	JONES	Yeah? How'd the kid hold up?
M	COBB	Pretty good. He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
M	BECK	Charge set?
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)	Charge set. Backing off. C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
M	BECK	I need more light on that, Four.
F	WILLIE	Roger... More light, Sixpack... Sixpack?
M	SIXPACK	Boo!
F	WILLIE	You shit....
M	BECK'S VOICE	What's going on, Four? What's happening?
F	WILLIE	We're fine, Shack. His lights malfunctioned for a minute. How's this?
M	BECK	That's great. Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
F	WILLIE	You screw around like that again and--
M	SIXPACK	What's wrong, did you miss me?
F	WILLIE	Hardly.
M	SIXPACK	Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
M	BECK	What's wrong?! What happened?
F	WILLIE	Sixpack?! Sixpack...
M	BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)	Willie? What's going on?
F	WILLIE	He's gone. I think he's fallen. I'm going down after him.
M	DEJESUS	That's it Jonesy...Sweat it out, man...Got to get the poison out of our blood.
F	BOWMAN	Sixpack is lost.
M	COBB	Weren't they tied? They're supposed to be tied.
M	JONES	How far away is she?
M	DOC	Two hundred meters.
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)	Four to Shack...nearing the bottom. Look at this...
M	DOC	My God, look at the size of those tubers....
M	DEJESUS	Nine, ten feet high...
F	BOWMAN	If he had his blinkers on--
M	JONES	It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
F	WILLIE	Sixpack?
M	BECK	Why can't we pick up his signal?
M	DEJESUS	Maybe he got eaten?
F	BOWMAN	What would be dumb enough to eat Sixpack?
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)	Four to Shack...you picking this up?
M	BECK	Affirmative...Widening picture. Tighten the picture on the upper righthand corner.
M	COBB	What the?...
M	DOC	Russian.
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)	I'm going inside.
M	BECK	What's your air reading?
M	WILLIE'S VOICE	Twenty minutes...
M	BECK	Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
F	BOWMAN	Who else...Sixpack.
M	JONES	The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
F	BOWMAN	What about his suit? That's a million five the company's got to replace. They'll make somebody go get it.
M	BECK	Willie, we're giving you five minutes...after that we're coming in.
F	WILLIE	Sixpack?...Answer me. The infirmary... Three minutes...
M	BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)	One minute.
M	SIXPACK	I'm rich, honey. Rich!
M	SIXPACK	It's all mine if I'm on report. Otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more... Ain't that right, Cobbie?
M	COBB	You're on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off...
F	BOWMAN	Personal effects...
F	WILLIE	Timex... Here's something for you, Cobbie.
M	JONES	Russian money...Don't look like much.
F	BOWMAN	Yeah, I'd say you can retire with all this loot.
M	SIXPACK	Shut up.
F	WILLIE	What is it?
M	JONES	"Debbie Does Dallas"... Hell, it's in Russian. I can't read it...
M	DOC	May I see it? It's a log of some sort.
F	WILLIE	Vodka.
M	COBB	What assholes, they lock booze in the safe.
M	DEJESUS	Probably confiscated. No booze on board, same as us.
M	DOC	Stolichnaya.
M	COBB	You read Russian?
M	DOC	Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
M	COBB	Bullshit.
M	DOC	...and a Russian grandmother...
M	BECK	I want all this stuff impounded in the supply safe. ...except this...it goes in my safe.
M	DOC	You mind if I take a look at this?
M	BECK	Be my guest.
M	DEJESUS	You got 'em!
M	SIXPACK	What good's the kid's med records anyway!
M	DEJESUS	Watch and learn, amigo...
M	DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)	Another party last night. More Vodka. The infirmary is filled as it is. I confiscate what I can, but I know the Government Observers have more...
M	DOC(cont'd)	See that gash? The way the edges protrude inward is like from a torpedo explosion. It couldn't have come from within. Like an accident.
M	BECK	What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
M	DOC	These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
M	BECK	What mistakes? Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
M	DOC	I did. They have no record of the wreck. The Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea.
M	DEJESUS	It's not the phone number...
M	BOWMAN'S VOICE	Okay, try the social security number...
M	DEJESUS	Okay, give it to me...
F	BOWMAN	Two...twelve...ninety-six.
M	SIXPACK	You guys are so full of shit... Who's going to use their birthday...
M	DEJESUS VOICE	BINGO!
M	SIXPACK	Like I said, that bottle's mine!
M	DOC	I want your permission to check that vodka.
M	BECK	This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc. If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back.
M	COBB	Beck's coming.
M	BECK	Something wrong, Cobb?
M	COBB	Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
M	BECK	What's wrong with it?
M	COBB	...I'd really have to show it to you.
M	BECK	All right... ...Just let me put this in my safe...
M	BECK	Something wrong?
F	BOWMAN	Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
M	JONES	Aw, loosen up, Bowman... Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
F	WILLIE	No, thanks. I've got my blood tests in three days.
M	DEJESUS	That's all you do is exercise. You got to learn to live a little.
F	WILLIE	After my astronaut training physical, then I'll tie one on.
M	SIXPACK	Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.
M	COBB	Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing?
M	DEJESUS	He won't...
M	DEJESUS(cont'd)	I poured the vodka in here.
M	SIXPACK	Shit! It's water!
M	JONES	Beck switched it!
M	DEJESUS	Can you beat that? The sonof- abitch doesn't trust us!
M	SIXPACK	That little turd. If I ever get the chance I'll fix his ass.
F	BOWMAN	Didn't I ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink?
M	BECK	That was a loud one wasn't it?
F	WILLIE	After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
M	BECK	How's astronaut training?
F	WILLIE	Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
M	BECK	No. I'm just being friendly.
F	WILLIE	Good...It's going good.
M	BECK	Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
F	WILLIE	I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
M	BECK	Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
F	WILLIE	Has it helped?
F	WILLIE	I guess there's not a lot of adventure in the Control Room.
M	BECK	You think I should hang around more with the crew?
F	WILLIE	Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it. How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
M	BECK	I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
F	WILLIE	Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
M	JONES	Puuleeeeze...
M	DEJESUS	Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine amigo...
M	DOC	Let's see your tongue.
M	BECK	What's wrong?
M	DOC	Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
M	SIXPACK	Well, it ain't! It feels a thousand times worse.
M	DOC	Where?
M	SIXPACK	I...I dunno. I just feel... wrong.
M	DOC	Take off your shirt.
M	DOC (cont'd)	How long...how long have you had these?
M	SIXPACK	Shit, Doc...I didn't know I had them.
F	MARTIN	...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
M	BECK	I know that.
F	MARTIN	Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision... Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
M	BECK	How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
F	MARTIN	Beautiful.
M	COBB	Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
M	DEJESUS	He's tanking on us...
F	WILLIE	No...he's really sick. I heard him last night. The company will take that into consideration...
M	JONES	Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
M	DEJESUS	'Cocksucker's tanking on us...
M	BECK	No, he's really sick...He won't be going out today.
M	COBB	There goes our quota...
F	BOWMAN	Thirty days, right down the toilet...
M	COBB	Excuse me, sir...
M	BECK	Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
M	COBB	No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
M	BECK	Thanks...
M	SIXPACK	Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...
M	DOC	I'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope...Afterwards I'll give you a sedative.
M	DEJESUS	Okay, number 23's full.
M	BECK	Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
M	JONES	Yes sir...
F	BOWMAN	Hook's on 24...
M	BECK	Let's have her...
M	DOC	No kidding? "A virus of unknown origin." Come on and tell me something I don't know... like what's going on...
M	DOC(cont'd)	Then take a guess, goddamnit!
M	DEJESUS	Good work out there, Mr. Becky.
M	JONES	Thank you, sir.
M	BECK	Dead? This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
M	DOC	He did.
M	BECK	Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
M	DOC	Here. Put this on. You examine him.
M	BECK	I'm not a doctor.
M	DOC	For this...you don't need to be.
M	BECK	The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
M	DOC	I don't know. I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
M	BECK	And?
M	DOC	And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
M	BECK	Why Sixpack?
M	DOC	It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... But he went on that ship and so did Williams... I want to examine the crew.
M	BECK	Yeah...right...
M	DOC	I've reported the death to the company.
M	JONES	"Routine," my ass! Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
M	COBB	He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine precaution."
F	WILLIE	Must be bad. Even sick Sixpack never missed a meal.
M	DEJESUS	It's this fucking air system....
M	COBB	Ain't the food or the air system, he's just sick... Everybody gets sick every now and then. It's all part of being human!
F	BOWMAN	Well, I must be human because I'm sure as hell sick.
M	COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)	I guess I'm kinda...outta shape... This skin condition...what is it? Like herpes, or measles, or what?
M	DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)	It's difficult to describe.
M	COBB	Christ, it'd be a hell of a thing if I went back to the roof with some kind of herpes thing. My wife wouldn't understand that at all...
M	DOC	You seem all right.
M	COBS	She wouldn't understand. She'd think I was down here fucking my head off.
M	JONES	This whole thing's unnecessary, Doc. Only "skin problem" I got is white people... How come you're wearing those gloves?
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)	This disease...do you know what causes it?
M	DOC	Not yet. You got any ideas?
F	WILLIE	You don't think it was from going on that ship do you?
M	DOC	That's a possibility. But if it was that simple why haven't the symptoms begun on you?
F	WILLIE	You mean I'm okay?
M	DOC	You're fine.
M	DEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.)	What do you mean, "a skin problem"... your skin changes?
M	DOC	It blackens...becomes scaly.
M	DEJESUS	You mean like a fish?
M	DOC	Yes...like a fish...
M	DEJESUS	I was just joking, Doc.
F	MARTIN	Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body. However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
M	BECK	What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
F	MARTIN	But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
M	BECK	I'm not anxious to find out, either.
F	MARTIN	Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
M	BECK	Do it.
F	MARTIN	Unfortunately. We can't. There is a typhoon about 600 miles off the coast of Baja. It's not coming your way but the Company doesn't want to lose you folks or an emergency ship should it veer your way.
M	BECK	What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
F	MARTIN	It shouldn't be a long delay.
M	BECK	But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
F	MARTIN	Twelve hours, no big deal. We should know something first thing in the morning. Don't worry.
F	WILLIE	Bo? Doc says you're next.
M	WILLIE(cont'd)	Bo?...You okay?
M	JONES	Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man... How you feeling?
M	JONES	Hey, man, we made quota to- day. No thanks to you, you dog, but we made it...Beck helped us...We just dropped Bowman off. I hope what you've got ain't catching... Oh, man, sorry...you go back to sleep.
F	WILLIE	Who were you talking to?
M	JONES	Sixpack...
F	WILLIE	How is he?
M	JONES	Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I'll check the control room. You look in the shower room...
F	BOWMAN	Oh, God...what's going on?
F	BOWMAN	Sixpack...what's going on?
M	DOC	You have to call them back. Explain that this is an emergency.
M	JONES	Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick. She's downstairs in the infirmary.
M	DOC	The infirmary?...
M	JONES	Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
M	DOC	We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
M	BECK	Sixpack's dead.
M	JONES	Bullshit...I was just talking to him. I saw him move.
M	BECK	What?...
M	JONES	I left her here.
M	DOC	Bowman?
M	DOC	Bowman. It's Doc. I'm here to help you.
M	BECK	I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
M	DEJESUS	And it killed Bo?
M	BECK	No...she killed herself.
M	JONES	We're getting out of here just in time.
M	BECK	There's now a problem with the weather for pickup. There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
M	DEJESUS	Typhoon?!
M	JONES	Twelve hours!
M	COBB	At least we get time and a half. That's in the contract.
M	JONES	Fuck double pay, man! I want out of here!
M	BECK	Jones... Stay here.
M	DEJESUS	C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
M	COBB	I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
M	BECK	Shut up, all of you.
M	COBB	Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
M	JONES	Fuck the contract, man! C'mon...Lift!
M	DEJESUS	Hey!...I feel something. It's moving! He's alive!
M	COBB	I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
M	JONES	Cobb, what're you doing!
M	COBS	But he ain't dead! He ain't dead.
M	BECK	Cobb! Stop!
M	COBB	It bit me! It bit me!
M	JONES	Push Hazy!
M	JONES	Oh, Jesus Christ! I ain't never gonna sleep again!
M	BECK	No!
M	COBB	It bit me!
M	DEJESUS	It's Sixpack!
M	COBB	I'm going to kill it!
M	BECK	Close the Lock! Now!
M	BECK(cont'd)	Hit it again! Flush it!
M	BECK	I think we just found our problem.
M	DEJESUS	Serves his ass right to get it. Motherfucker brings that shit onboard. I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
M	JONES	'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
M	COBB	He knew better than that.
F	WILLIE	You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka...It could have been you.
M	DOC	Hold it! Rewind it.
M	DOC	Stop it.
M	DOC	Back it up slowly.
M	DOC	There.
M	DEJESUS	You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man? Think about that. Sixty-four square miles.
M	JONES	How'd you do that?
M	DEJESUS	What? That?...I've done this one before. You hungry? I'm hungry.
M	JONES	Hungry? After what we just went through I may never eat again.
M	BECK	They found this?
M	DOC	No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
M	BECK	Was there such a thing?
M	DOC	Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
M	BECK	Not exactly a big ocean country.
M	DOC	It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... adapted.
M	DOC	Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
M	BECK	But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
M	DOC	Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
M	BECK	Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship? Why isn't he out swimming around?
M	DOC	He obviously lacked something in his environment.
M	JONES' VOICE	Turned black yet?
M	COBS	That ain't funny.
M	JONES	Relax, Cobb. If it was going to turn, it would have done its trick by now.
M	COBB	That's easy for you to say. You ain't the one that got bit.
M	JONES	Don't tell me you're getting soft on us, Cobbie? You're the fellow who always said--
M	COBB	Nothing's changed, goddamnit!
M	JONES	Man, everybody is jumpy... What are you doing?
M	DEJESUS	Getting some food.
M	JONES	Under there?
M	DEJESUS	Look. Water.
M	JONES	Probably the plumbing. You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
M	DEJESUS	No, I'll be right there.
M	DEJESUS	Mustard. Need mustard...
M	DEJESUS	Sixpack...
M	DEJESUS	Ahhh!
M	JONES	Hey, Hazy...what're you doing now...cooking?
M	JONES(cont'd)	Hazy?... Holy shit!
M	DEJESUS	Help me, Jonesy. Oh, God, help me! It's getting inside me, I can feel it!
M	JONES	Hazy, please...I'm going to get you some help, man...just don't touch me...
M	COBB	What's going on?
M	JONES	It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out. I'm going to get the Doc.
M	DEJESUS	Help me! Help me!
M	JONES	It's got Hazy!
M	BECK	What has?
M	JONES	One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
M	DOC	We've got to get him to the infirmary.
M	JONES	What are you going to do to him?
M	DOC	I'm going to try to remove it.
M	JONES	I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
M	JONES	Cobb? Hazy? Oh, shit...He's gone...
M	JONES	You let him get away!
M	COBB	I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
M	JONES	That thing happens to be my friend.
M	BECK	Shut up, both of you! We've got to find it. Where's Willie?
M	COBB	Oh, God, she's out there...
M	BECK	Jones...come with me. Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
M	JONES	Willie...
F	WILLIE	Yeah?
F	WILLIE	What on earth's the matter with you?
M	JONES	I ought to smack your face!
F	WILLIE	What's wrong?
M	JONES	DeJesus...It's got him.
M	BECK	I thought they were your friends?
M	JONES	Were, Doss were.
M	BECK	You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down.
M	JONES	Jones to Doc. Doc?...Cobb?
M	JONES(cont'd)	Think it got 'em?
M	BECK	No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?
M	JONES	He did.
M	COBB	What happened?
M	DOC	It...almost got you.
M	COBB	What was it?
M	COBS	I saw it! It's big!
M	BECK	Big?
M	JONES	Bigger than DeJesus? How?
M	DOC	It's had a meal.
F	WILLIE	It needs blood?
M	JONES	Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
M	DOC	It would explain the suction- like appendages.
M	JONES	Like a leech.
M	BECK	That's why there's a dead one on the ship. It ran out of blood.
M	JONES	What dead one on the ship? Someone want to let the rank and file in on your little secret?
M	DOC	The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
M	JONES	No fuckin' lie...
M	DOC	...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy... but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
M	COBB	What?...What?
M	BECK	That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
M	DOC	Intelligence may not be the right word...
M	JONES	Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
M	DOC	I don't know. I'm guessing.
M	COBB	I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
M	JONES	And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
F	WILLIE	What can we do?
M	BECK	it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
M	COBB	And how're we going to do that?
M	DOC	Be careful with it.
M	BECK	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
M	DOC	Still bothering you?
M	COBB	Itches like hell.
M	DOC	Take it off and let me have a look.
M	DOC	Looks good to me. I'll re-bandage it, though. Willie, would you clean it for me. I'm going to the infirmary for supplies.
F	WILLIE	You can't go out there alone.
M	DOC	I'm the Doctor. I have to do what's best for this crew. I need my bag.
M	DOC	There, good as new. Just keep your paws off of it. Do you have the new bandage ready?
F	WILLIE	Doc?...Doc!
M	DOC	No!
M	BECK	I hear something. Don't fire until we're both in the Swamp. Don't let him see you.
M	JONES	Don't worry...
M	JONES	C'mon baby c'mon...
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)	Beck? Jones!?
F	WILLIE	Oh God...
M	BECK	Run Willie! Run!
M	JONES	Well done. Just like momma makes 'em.
M	BECK	Where's Cobb and Doc?
F	WILLIE	Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
M	JONES	Oh man, that's just great...
M	BECK	C'mon.
M	BECK	Lock the door.
M	BECK	Shit! He sent them all.
F	WILLIE	The escape bubbles?
M	JONES	Look at this.
F	WILLIE	What is it?
M	JONES	The good doctor signed our death warrant.
F	WILLIE	Well, at least we're safe inside here.
M	JONES	For how long?
F	MARTIN	Thank goodness, you're still alive!
M	JONES	Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us. You hear me, motherfucker? Right now!
F	MARTIN	Please relax, Mr. Jones. Every- thing is under control. Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you.
F	WILLIE	When are you coming for us?
F	MARTIN	Well, that's the bad news. The typhoon did turn your way. Right now it is on a course--
M	JONES	Just answer the question, man! When are you coming?!
F	MARTIN	Hopefully in the next 48 hours.
M	BECK	Forty-eight hours!
F	MARTIN	I realize you must have gone through hell--
M	JONES	Gone? Man, we're still here!
F	MARTIN	I can't change the weather. Try to get some rest. I'll keep you posted.
M	BECK	He's right. Why don't you get some rest. I'll stand the first watch.
M	BECK	Martin, you asshole...
F	WILLIE	They know, don't they?
M	BECK	Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
F	WILLIE	Maybe they already have.
M	BECK	What are you doing?
F	WILLIE	Seeing how my stock's doing...
F	WILLIE	Where?....
M	BECK	I can't believe they'd just leave us.
M	JONES	Welcome to the union, boss. We're all expendable.
F	WILLIE	What is it?
M	JONES	The air's stopped.
M	BECK	We're on backup air.
F	WILLIE	How much time does that give us?
M	BECK	Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
F	WILLIE	Can't we fix it?
M	JONES	There're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge, they could have tapped-in anywhere.
M	JONES	Cobb...Job security...
M	BECK	They're drawing us out.
F	WILLIE	You can't go out there, that's what they want.
M	BECK	We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
M	JONES	Crunch...Implosion.
F	WILLIE	You don't think I'm sitting in here, do you?
F	WILLIE	The shack...
M	JONES	She's wondering what's happening. We're losing air faster than I thought.
M	BECK	Which way?
M	BECK	I'll go first.
F	WILLIE	Don't spend all day down there.
M	JONES	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
F	WILLIE	Okay, Williams...let's hear a tune. "Off we go...into the wild blue yonder..." "...flying high into the sky..."
M	JONES	Jesus Christ...
M	BECK	Can you fix it?
M	JONES	No way...
M	BECK	Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
M	JONES	I am thinking, man! You think I want to die! I am thinking! I--
M	JONES	I hit it. But I can't see it! Can you see it?!
M	BECK	No.
M	JONES	The Swamp. There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp.
M	JONES	Ahhh!
M	BECK	Hurry...Get out!
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)	Hey, you?
M	BECK	Jones! Get your feet out of the water!
M	BECK	C'mon, the Swamp!
M	JONES	Beck!
M	BECK	Go on!
M	JONES	No!
M	BECK	That's an order!
M	JONES	Fuck your orders!
F	WILLIE	It's jammed!
M	JONES	Where the hell've you been?
M	BECK	I got hung up! Try this!
M	JONES	It won't go!
M	BECK	The suits! Get in them!
M	JONES	The suits! Are you crazy! How're we going to get to the surface?
M	BECK	Like this. Get them in the Lock!
M	JONES	Your suit, Becky!
M	BECK	Just get in yours!
F	WILLIE	Look out!
M	JONES/RADIO	I'm in.
M	BECK	Go!
M	WILLIE/RADIO	No!
M	BECK	Go, now! That's an order!
M	DEJESUS	Kill me...Kill me!
M	BECK	No!
M	WILLIE(RADIO)	Light. Beck, I see light!
M	BECK(RADIO)	Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
M	WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)	Roger.
M	WILLIE(RADIO)	Ejecting.
F	WILLIE	We made it!
M	BECK	Where's Jones?
F	WILLIE	Is he okay? The sun! The sun!
M	JONES	What happened to that typhoon?
F	WILLIE	Are you sure you saw something?
M	JONES	How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
F	WILLIE	Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
M	BECK	We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.
F	WILLIE	Are you okay, Jonesy?
M	JONES	Tip top, Willie...tip top.
F	WILLIE	Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
M	JONES	Jameson? Who are you trying to con...?
M	BECK	I'll be damned. Look!...A flare!
F	WILLIE	It saw us!
M	JONES	Answer them and quit kicking me!
F	WILLIE	I'm not touching you!
F	WILLIE	No...no, no, no.
M	CAPTAIN	I thought you said you'd combed this area?
F	MARTIN	We did....Many times.
M	CAPTAIN	Initiate rescue.
F	WILLIE	It hit me! Where are they?!
M	BECK	I can't see them!
M	JONES	All right! I've had enough of this shit! You want meat, motherfucker? Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat! What's wrong you snout-nosed bastards? My meat too tough for you?! Whoa! Did you see those fools run? They know whose boss.
M	BECK	Jonesy...Give me your hand!
M	BECK	C'mon, Jones!
M	BECK	Jonesy, No!
M	JONES	Get out of here, Becky!
M	WINCH OPERATOR	Is he in the harness!
M	BECK	C'mon, motherfucker open up!
M	CAPTAIN	Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your physical with flying colors. And Ms. Williams?
M	BECK	I don't know yet, she's still in there.
M	CAPTAIN	Well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard.
F	MARTIN	Beck! I told them you'd make it. No one back at TransOcean believed me, but I never gave up on you once. So, how are you feeling?
M	BECK	Better...A lot better.
F	WILLIE	I'm fine!
M	CAPTAIN	I thought we might have some wonderful seafood. But, if there's something else you'd rather have...
F	WILLIE	How about a burger and fries?
