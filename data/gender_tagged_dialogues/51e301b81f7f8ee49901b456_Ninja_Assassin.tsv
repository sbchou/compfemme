M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	HOLLYWOOD	Fuck! Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking- fuck!
M	HOLLYWOOD	Watch it, old man! What the fuck? You're doing it wrong.
M	TATTOO ARTIST	The needle is doing what the needle does.
M	HOLLYWOOD	What's that supposed to mean? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 2. CONTINUED: 1
M	TATTOO MASTER	The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited.
M	HOLLYWOOD	What did you just say, old man? I know you didn't just disrespect me, did you? You that fucking stupid? You disrespect me, and I'll tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains!
M	TATTOO MASTER	No disrespect.
M	HOLLYWOOD	You're lucky. I can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How's it looking?
M	HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)	Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck.
M	YAKUZA ONE	Hey, boss. This just came for you.
M	HOLLYWOOD	What is it? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 3. CONTINUED: (2) 1
M	YAKUZA ONE	A letter.
M	HOLLYWOOD	So open it, dumb ass. What? What is it?
M	YAKUZA ONE	Looks like sand.
M	YAKUZA ONE (CONT'D)	Yup. Sand. Black Sand.
M	TATTOO MASTER	No...
M	HOLLYWOOD	You know what this is?
M	HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)	Wanna let us in on the joke?
M	TATTOO MASTER	Years ago, I watched a man open an envelope like that one.
M	TATTOO MASTER (CONT'D)	There were many with him and they laughed like you laugh now. Then it came from the shadows and their laughter was drowned in blood. You cannot bargain with what is coming. You cannot reason with it. Because it is not a human being. It is a demon sent straight from hell that will never stop until you are dead. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 4. CONTINUED: (3) 1
M	HOLLYWOOD	What came out of the shadows?
M	TATTOO MASTER	I cannot say the word.
M	HOLLYWOOD	What word?
M	TATTOO ARTIST	That night, one of their blades struck here. I should have died, but for an accident of birth. My heart is here, on the other side.
M	HOLLYWOOD	What the fuck is that?
M	YAKUZA ONE	Looks like a Ninja, boss.
M	HOLLYWOOD	A ninja? Are you kidding me? That's the word you're afraid to say? Ninja?
M	HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)	Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!
M	HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)	You old fuck! You had me going! Ninja. That's some good shit. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 5. CONTINUED: (4) 1
M	HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)	Listen... you don't have to do this! Whatever you're getting paid, I'll triple it! You hear me! I'll pay you whatever you want! Just name your price!
M	TATTOO ARTIST	But you are real, aren't you?
M	TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)	For fifty-seven-years, I've told your story... GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 6. No one ever believed me.
M	TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)	But you are real, aren't you?
M	CHECKER	That's a lot of noodles. Are you a student? Tourist? Here on business?
M	CHECKER (CONT'D)	When was the last time someone cooked you a real meal? I get off at seven. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 7. CONTINUED: 3 You could come by, let me make you a proper dinner!
M	RAIZO	I don't think so. Sorry.
M	CHECKER	So if you're not a student, and you're not a tourist, and you're not here to work... what are you doing?
M	RAIZO	Waiting.
M	CHECKER	For what?
M	RAIZO	For the wheel to turn.
M	OZUNU (V.O.)	Wherever you are, wherever you may go....
M	OZUNU	...you must never, ever forget who you are, how you came to be. You are Ozunu. You are a part of me as I am a part of you. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 8. CONTINUED: 5
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	This is the truth of your lives and it will remain true after death.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	This is my new son. I have given him the name Raizo. Welcome him as your brother.
M	MASLOW *	What's all this for the Delgata * case? *
M	MIKA *	No. This is Delgata- *
M	MASLOW *	And the rest? *
M	MIKA *	...evidence. *
M	MASLOW *	For? *
M	MASLOW (CONT'D) *	Oh no. Not again. *
M	MIKA *	You said you'd take it serious * when I had serious evidence. * GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 8A. CONTINUED: 5A
M	MASLOW *	Does that evidence include photos * of the Loch Ness monster as well? *
M	MIKA *	You've trusted my research before, * what's the problem now Ryan? *
M	MASLOW *	What's the problem? Come on Mika, * it's like one of those questions * on an IQ test, which of these * doesn't belong; laptops, space * shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas. *
M	MIKA *	All I'm asking for is an hour. * That's all. Give me an hour and * if you still think I'm chasing * UFO's, I'll walk out and you'll * never hear another thing about * them. *
M	MASLOW *	Why do I think I'm going to regret * this? *
M	LANDLADY (O.S.)	Oh, Mr. Nan, good, you're back.
M	LANDLADY (CONT'D)	We had a heating problem, and I had to go into your apartment.
M	RAIZO	Is everything all right? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 8B. CONTINUED: 6
M	LANDLADY	Yes, fine, it's all fixed. You keep it very dark and spare in there.
M	RAIZO	Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me. If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your building.
M	LANDLADY	I just -- GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 9. CONTINUED: (2) 6
M	RAIZO	Good day.
M	OZUNU (V.O.)	You should have died.
M	OZUNU	On the street. Abandoned by your parents. Without a home. Without people to care for you. You should have done as most children do, and gone quietly from this world, to the next. But, instead you fought. As you did here today. You fought. And you won.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Scars are the calligraphy of violence, Raizo. They inscribe the story of one's life. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 10. CONTINUED: 8 You survived because you are different. You are special. That is why you are here. That is why the Great Current, which flows beneath all life, carried you to me.
M	MIKA (V.O.)	It's a pattern, like the currents of the ocean.
F	MIKA	Some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we're talking about 19th century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money.
M	MASLOW	You're excited, Mika. You know I get nervous when you're excited.
F	MIKA	You remember the Eulmi incident? * GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 11. CONTINUED: 11
M	MASLOW	Korean queen, late eighteen- * hundred's. According to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja clans.
F	MIKA	Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda.
M	MASLOW	So you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained constant.
F	MIKA	Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	I started looking at international wire transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high- profile assassinations and bingo-
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	Minister Zhang. The day before the assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of Shanghai. The exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold.
M	MASLOW	Highly circumstantial. * GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 12. CONTINUED: (2) 11
F	MIKA	I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.
M	MASLOW	Let me guess.
F	MIKA	Not once.
M	MASLOW	Okay you got me. This is * interesting. *
F	MIKA	The clans are real, Ryan. They * steal children and turn them into * assassins. They've been doing it * for years and nobody's doing a * damn thing to stop them. *
M	MASLOW	Look, no one's denying the historical record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. It's like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas.
F	MIKA	They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 13.
M	OZUNU	Our enemies are everywhere.
M	OZUNU	You must move without trace or * footprint.
M	PRETTY WOMAN	Hi... excuse me...? Would you mind?
M	RAIZO	...sorry?
M	PRETTY WOMAN	If it's not too much trouble, could you help me with this? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 13A. CONTINUED: 12B
M	RAIZO	What clan are you from?
M	PRETTY WOMAN	I... don't understand...
M	RAIZO	You came alone. The Ozunu clan would never make such a mistake. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 14. CONTINUED: (2) 12B
M	MANAGER	What is going on-
M	MASLOW	And two cokes, please.
F	MIKA	How long have you been here? And you can't say "zwei cola bitte"?
M	MASLOW	Course I can, but you tend to hear more interesting things if people don't know you can understand what they're saying.
F	MIKA	Do you ever stop being a cop?
M	MASLOW	Not the way I was raised. My dad always said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 15. CONTINUED: 15
F	MIKA	Desire?
M	MASLOW	For justice. And doughnuts.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	So you got something else?
F	MIKA	I think so. Same template as before. The transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.
M	MASLOW	How do you know what the police report says? You're not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes, are you?
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	Good.
F	MIKA	What about the bank audit?
M	MASLOW	Denied. It was a long shot at best.
F	MIKA	But you said you found something.
M	MASLOW	A report. A friend of mine in Moscow, tipped me to it.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	It was written during the height of the Cold War by a high ranking KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin. In it, he raises the possibility that several political assassinations were conducted by an ancient but very sophisticated network he calls the Nine Clans. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 16. Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.
F	MIKA	What happened to him?
M	MASLOW	Same thing that's going to happen to me, if I keep hanging around with you- booted out of the service for mental instability.
F	MIKA	Is he still alive? We need to find him.
M	MASLOW	Working on it.
F	MIKA	You believe it now, don't you?
M	MASLOW	Ninjas? Are you kidding?
F	MIKA	Then why are you doing this?
M	MASLOW	No idea- But I can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're the most attractive researcher that I've ever worked with. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 17. CONTINUED: 16

M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	This is the power of the Ozunu clan.

M	SABATIN (V.O.)	Historical evidence suggests that Ibn-Battuta's journey through the far east brought him into contact with what might be one of the oldest of the Nine Clans. He travels with a group of orphans that are being taken from a city devastated by war to the Shido of the Ozunu clan. The people of the surrounding province refer to the Shido as "The Orphanage."
M	SABATIN (V.O.)	Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner followed by a display of martial skill. The combatants were children neither beyond the age of ten.
M	SABATIN (CONT'D)	His host explains that a man's life must be made meaningless compared to the life of the Clan. Own the meaning of a man's life and you own his heart.

M	OZUNU	Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the weapon you will need to survive. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 22A.
M	RAIZO	You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you --
F	KIRIKO	Then they catch me.
M	RAIZO	They'll put you in the box.
F	KIRIKO	Yes, they will.
M	KIRIKO (CONT'D)	I believe the heart of the tree knows which way it needs to grow.
M	RAIZO	Trees don't have hearts.

M	MASLOW	Last night I'm working late and I get a visit. Guy named Zabranski. Works upstairs for Internal Affairs. Just drops by. In the neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya doin- kinda thing. Asks what I'm working on. Oh, this and that, usual blibbity blab, I tell him. Then he smiles and says-
M	ZABRANSKI	...Very Good.
M	MASLOW	I don't understand what is really going on, but I'm smart enough to recognize a warning when I see one.
F	MIKA	But why?
M	MASLOW	Why? It's obvious. If your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them.
F	MIKA	What are you going to do?
M	MASLOW	We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from here on out. You understand? You don't do anything else without checking with me. Got it?
F	MIKA	Did you find Sabatin yet? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 29. CONTINUED: 31 You did.
M	MASLOW	Yeah...he's dead.
F	MIKA	How?
M	MASLOW	Heart attack.
F	MIKA	They killed him.
M	MASLOW	People die of heart attacks, Mika.
F	MIKA	Was he married? Did he have a family?
M	MASLOW	God, you are relentless, aren't you.
F	MIKA	I know you Ryan, you would have checked.
M	MASLOW	A wife.
F	MIKA	Still in Russia?
M	MASLOW	Relocated.
F	MIKA	Where?
M	MASLOW	Explain something to me first. Where is this obsession coming from? What started this whole thing? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 30.
F	MIKA	Like your father said...It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.
M	MASLOW	Desire for what?

F	MRS. SABATIN	Ah, sehr gut. Bitte...please.
F	MIKA	Shoen. between them.
F	MRS. SABATIN	You said you read my husband's report, yes? What did you think?
F	MIKA	I found it...illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript.
F	MRS. SABATIN	My husband journeyed all over the world researching that report, but when he was home, he never spoke about it. He said it was safer that way.
F	MIKA	I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the KGB.
F	MRS. SABATIN	The report caused "problems" for Alexei's career the way Moses caused problems for the Pharaoh, you see? Very unpleasant. Terrible people saying terrible things. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 34. CONTINUED: 37
M	MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)	After he retired...was asked to retire...we moved, first to Byelorussia and then here to Berlin when the wall came down. He said this will be a good place to grow old together. And it was, for a time.
F	MIKA	What happened?
F	MRS. SABATIN	About two years ago...two? Yes, after the assassination of Zhukov, the report drew attention. After that, everything was different.
M	MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)	Alexei hired men to change all the locks, and put in more of them. Locks on the windows, locks on the doors, locks on the locks. He put in cameras and motion sensors and lights...everywhere, lights.
M	MRS. SABATIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	"There can be no shadows," he said. "No shadows."
F	MRS. SABATIN	I will tell you a true thing, and a hard thing. My husband was a soldier. A member of Russian intelligence. He had seen many terrible things.... He was not a man to frighten easily. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 35. CONTINUED: 38A But from that day on, when the sun went down behind the hills...in his eyes, I saw the fear a child has of the dark. Then, one day, a man came to the door.
M	MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)	They talked in Alexei's study for sometime. Then the young man left.
M	MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)	It was unlike Alexei not to see him out. I remember being very scared. But when I opened the door, he was just sitting there. For a moment, he didn't even notice me. Then he stood up and kissed me and told me that he loved me very much. He said I should always remember that. Do you know what they talked about?
F	MRS. SABATIN	No. Alexei never spoke about it. But two months later, he was dead.
F	MIKA	Can I ask how he died? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 36.
F	MRS. SABATIN	The lights went out.
M	MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)	You are the first person who has taken my husband's work seriously. It would be good to know that he did not die without cause. Come with me.
M	MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)	He would want you to have this. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 37. CONTINUED: 41 GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 38. CONTINUED: 44 in. You lied to me.

F	MIKA	...I'm sorry, it was the only way * I could get the evidence. *
M	MASLOW	Shit....
F	MIKA	What happened?
M	MASLOW	What happened? Everything's fucking happened.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	When you were slapping my code all over town like some phone number in a bathroom, did you happen to notice the classification code on the cases you were digging through? What did it say?
F	MIKA	That's right. DNP. DO NOT FUCKING PURSUE!
F	MIKA	Actually that would be DNFP --
M	MASLOW	Right now there are people from internal affairs, CIA, Homeland Security and for all I know the Martian Fucking Military in my office tearing the place apart. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 40. CONTINUED: 45A I don't know what they're looking for but I think you do.
F	MIKA	Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty.
M	MASLOW	And this?
F	MIKA	That's how it started. I made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that.
M	MASLOW	...Christ.
F	MIKA	Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war.
M	MASLOW	So you requisitioned this by accident. You used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. Which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.
F	MIKA	I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn't mean for you to get in trouble... GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 41. I just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them. Isn't that what your dad would do?
M	MASLOW	Okay, that's low.
F	MIKA	Look, I know I broke the rules. I'll explain what I did and accept the consequences.
M	MASLOW	Very noble of you but I've got the feeling this isn't a slap-on-the wrist kinda consequence. Let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. In the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody. Capiche?

M	ZABRANSKI (CONT'D)	Forensic researcher. You work a lot with an Agent...Maslow. That right?
F	MIKA	...A few cases.
M	ZABRANSKI	You have something of a social relationship.
F	MIKA	What?
M	ZABRANSKI	You had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.
F	MIKA	How do you know that?
M	ZABRANSKI	Is it not true?
F	MIKA	I...I'm not sure. We do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working-
M	ZABRANSKI	Are you working on something with him right now? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 43. CONTINUED: (2) 47
F	MIKA	No...not right now.
M	ZABRANSKI	Has Agent Maslow seemed different lately, in any way? Has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?
F	MIKA	No why. Has Agent Maslow done something?
M	ZABRANSKI	Just routine. The agency cares about its field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can wear on a man.
M	MASLOW (V.O.)	This is Ryan Maslow. Leave a number-
F	MIKA	Come on...you're kidding me. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 44. CONTINUED: 49

F	MIKA	Fucking Christ, Ryan-
M	MASLOW	I couldn't talk earlier. They're watching me.
F	MIKA	Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you.
M	MASLOW	I know how Sabatin must have felt.
F	MIKA	What happened?
M	MASLOW	I showed Jamison the materials.
F	MIKA	What did he say?
M	JAMISON	This agency is subject to the International laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority. If a case is marked DNP we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and act accordingly.
M	MASLOW	I understand that sir but-
M	JAMISON	Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 45.
F	MIKA	He took the materials?
M	MASLOW	Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it.
F	MIKA	What are we going to do?
M	MASLOW	Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go on holiday.
F	MIKA	No way-
M	MASLOW	Don't fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted you. Now you've got to trust me.
F	MIKA	Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me-
M	MASLOW	I'm not talking about my job, Mika.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	Take this. It's clean, no serial number. Untraceable.

M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	I'm going to try to find some help. Until then, I need you gone. Don't tell anyone where you're going, just go. Use this phone to text me when you get there, or if you have any problems.
F	MIKA	Ryan...
M	MASLOW	I know. It's unbelievable. I've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I've never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking unbelievable!
F	MIKA	Hey....
M	NEIGHBOR	Hi.
F	MIKA	What happened?
M	NEIGHBOR	Power's out. Us, the building behind us, that one across the street. Seems like every few months, boom, the lights out. I call, I complain, they listen...nothing gets done. So I sit out here, at least it's cool. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 47. CONTINUED: 52
M	NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)	Watch your step.
F	MIKA	You're not the first person to give me that advice today.... GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 48. CONTINUED: 54
M	RAIZO	You know me?
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	How?
F	MIKA	...security camera in New York. * Recorded you fighting...one of * them. *
M	RAIZO *	You know about them? *
F	MIKA	A little. * GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 48A. CONTINUED: (2) 54
M	MIKA (CONT'D) *	Uhh-- Well, there are these * clans...we're not sure how many. *
M	RAIZO *	Nine. *
M	MIKA *	Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And * they apparently have been * supplying assassins to governments * or anyone who happens to have one * hundred pounds of gold lying * around for the last thousand * years. Give or take. *
M	RAIZO *	His name was Jin. *
M	MIKA *	You knew him? *
M	RAIZO *	He was not born an "Assassin". *
M	MIKA *	...you're from his clan ? *
M	MIKA (CONT'D) *	Then...why did you stop him? *
M	RAIZO *	The clans have three kinds of * people! People with power. * People with money. Or people * hunting them. * GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 49. CONTINUED: (3) 54
M	RAIZO (CONT'D) *	They're coming.
F	MIKA	Who?
M	RAIZO	The Hanta-Kirra.
F	MIKA	Does that mean what I think it means?
M	RAIZO	They won't stop until you are * dead. *
F	MIKA	Oh god. *
M	RAIZO	The gun won't help you.
F	MIKA	I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities.
M	RAIZO	I can help but you must tell me * something first.
F	MIKA	What?
M	RAIZO	You saw Ms. Sabatin. *
M	MIKA *	How did you know that? *
M	RAIZO *	I've been watching you, waiting * for them. * GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 50. CONTINUED: (4) 54
M	RAIZO (CONT'D) *	Did she give you something? *
M	RAIZO (CONT'D) *	You have them?
F	MIKA	But I can get them.
M	RAIZO	We need something black. Hurry! *
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	Follow me. Step where I step. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 51. CONTINUED: 56
M	TAKESHI	Raizo.
M	DOG NINJA	He's taken the girl.
M	OZUNU (V.O.)	Weakness compels strength.
M	OZUNU	Betrayal begets blood. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 52.
M	OZUNU	This is the law of the Nine Clans. This is the way of the ninja.
F	MIKA	I'm going to have to make a phone call in order to get the manuscript.
M	RAIZO	Not now. Just drive.
F	MIKA	Where?
M	RAIZO	Does not matter. Just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention.
F	MIKA	You think they're following us?
M	RAIZO	I know they're following us. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 53. CONTINUED: 63
F	MIKA	I don't see anything back there.
M	RAIZO	They have our scent.
F	MIKA	Following our scent? Like dogs?
M	RAIZO	No. Like Wolves.
F	MIKA	How do you know so much about them?
M	RAIZO	I was one of them.
F	MIKA	You flunked out of ninja school or something?
M	RAIZO	...something.
M	OZUNU	You may remove the blindfold.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Your entire life has brought you to this moment. Do not fail yourself. Do not fail your family. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 54. CONTINUED: 64
M	MR. OZUNU	He is wearing a black and gold watch. Bring it to me.
M	KINGPIN	Wait here. Gotta piss.
M	BODYGUARD	Want me to come with you, boss?
M	KINGPIN	Why? So you can shake it for me? You some kind of secret faggot? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 55. CONTINUED: 66
M	KINGPIN	The fuck-? That kinda tickled...
M	KINGPIN (CONT'D)	Gonna take more than a knitting needle to fuck me up, boy.
M	OZUNU	Keep it. It will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that I have given you.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	You have made me proud tonight, Raizo. There are some who believed you would fail, but I knew you would not.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	You have a strength inside you Raizo. You must use that strength, now to show me that you are truly Ozunu.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets blood.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	A daughter that turned her back on her family. She tried to run. Takeshi hunted her down.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	It is the law of the Nine Clans. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 57. CONTINUED: (2) 67 Kill him!
F	MIKA	Okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I talk.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	My name is Mika by the way.
M	RAIZO	I know. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 58. CONTINUED: 68
F	MIKA	Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.
M	RAIZO	Raizo...is the name I was given.
F	MIKA	So, you were an orphan?
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	Interesting nature verses nurture case study I imagine.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	If it's okay with you, I'll try to fill in some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	Yeah, I got some moves too. I'm pretty lethal with the research thing. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 59. CONTINUED: (2) 68
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	But here's a question I can't answer: since you didn't know I went to Sabatin's, why did you save me?
M	RAIZO	Ninja only kill two kinds of people. The first kind has power and money. The other kind is trying to stop them.
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	Exit here.
F	MIKA	I understand retail therapy as well as any girl but I think it's a little late.
M	RAIZO	You are a size 36?
F	MIKA	What? No! Size 34...`cept certain times of the month.
M	RAIZO	If you leave while I am gone they will catch you and kill you.
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	Do you understand that? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 60. CONTINUED: 70 We need a hotel.
M	RAIZO	Get undressed. Shower. Do not use the hotel soap. Or any towel. Do you smoke?
F	MIKA	No.
M	RAIZO	Put your clothes in here. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 61. CONTINUED: 74
F	MIKA	Hey-
M	RAIZO	What?
F	MIKA	Don't you know how to knock?
M	RAIZO	I'm trying to save your life.
F	MIKA	...okay right.
M	RAIZO	Dry yourself with this.
F	MIKA	...I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with this...
M	RAIZO	Get dressed.
F	MIKA	These are a little tight.
M	RAIZO	You said 34.
F	MIKA	European sizes...run a little small I guess. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 62. CONTINUED: (2) 74
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	This is for my "scent"?
M	RAIZO	Let's go.
F	MIKA	Wow. They teach you that at ninja school?
M	RAIZO	Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of.
F	MIKA	You're going to steal a car?
M	RAIZO	Just borrow it.
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	Get in.
F	MIKA	In for a penny, in for a pounding. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 62A. CONTINUED: 75A
M	RAIZO	At ninja school I minored in electrical engineering.
M	RAIZO	Now we have some time. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 63. CONTINUED: 76
F	MIKA	How much time?
M	RAIZO	A day. Maybe less.
F	MIKA	Jesus.
M	RAIZO	Make your call.
F	MIKA	Ryan, it's me.
M	MASLOW	Mika! For Christ sake I've been calling for hours!
F	MIKA	I know. I'm in a bit of trouble-
M	MASLOW	Trouble? You miss jury duty you're in trouble. You're in some kind of bottomless pit of deep shit.
F	MIKA	Yeah. Least I'm not down here by myself...
M	MASLOW	Your guardian angel? Is it him? The one from the tape?
F	MIKA	He's on our side, Ryan. I trust him.
M	MASLOW	Careful, Mika.
F	MIKA	I promised him the Battuta pages. Do you still have them? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 64. CONTINUED: 77
M	MASLOW	...yeah, I got them.
F	MIKA	Can you meet us? In three hours?
M	MASLOW	Where?
F	MIKA	How bout the usual?
F	MIKA	There he is.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	He's a good man. It's all right.
M	MASLOW	Mika!
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	You're all right?
F	MIKA	Thanks to him.
M	RAIZO	Why have you done this?
F	MIKA	Done what?
M	MASLOW	Step back Mika.
F	MIKA	What?
M	RAIZO	People will die. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 65. CONTINUED: 78
M	MASLOW	NOW!
F	MIKA	No!
M	MILITARY MAN	Hands on your head! On your knees! Do it now!
F	MIKA	Raizo! No! This is wrong!
M	RAIZO	The clans have people everywhere.
F	MIKA	What are you doing?
M	MASLOW	Following orders.
M	OZUNU	Cut him.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	All failure must be sown into the flesh. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 65A. CONTINUED: 78A
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Cut him!
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	What?
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	You know the law!
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	You will wear this disgrace for the rest of your life!
M	SECURITY GOON	Prisoner is secure sir.
M	MASLOW	Right.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	Something's wrong with the infrared cam.
M	SECURITY GOON	No sir, we checked it.
M	MASLOW	Then why isn't he showing up?
M	SECURITY GOON	We think he's able to lower the temperature of his body to remain neutral.
M	MASLOW	Or maybe he's just cold-blooded.
M	SECURITY GOON #2	Sir! GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 66A. CONTINUED: 81
F	MIKA	Ryan, you know this is wrong! It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo?
M	MASLOW	It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid.
F	MIKA	Ryan you're making a huge mistake!
M	MASLOW	I don't think so. We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is where to extradite him first.
F	MIKA	So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?
M	MASLOW	We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies.
F	MIKA	He's not the enemy.
M	MASLOW	No? You ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome I'm getting the feeling I'm looking at a pretty serious case of it.
F	MIKA	I'm not crazy. This is! GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 67. CONTINUED: (2) 81
M	MASLOW	He's a killer, Mika. Weren't you the one telling me it was our job to stop him.
F	MIKA	You're not listening to me!
M	MASLOW	You're not saying anything worth hearing. Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute.
F	MIKA	Damn it, Ryan, I --
M	MASLOW	Listen to me, we don't have much time. Look, I don't know what you've stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some major strings inside.
F	MIKA	They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
M	MASLOW	I believe you. I believe you. I've been in this business too long not to smell a set-up. But we have to be careful how we handle this. And I can't risk you going AWOL on me again, because -- -- because I don't want anything to happen to you. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 68. CONTINUED: 82
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	If trouble comes, turn this on, no matter where, and I'll find you. You shouldn't do that they'll catch you.
M	KIRIKO (V.O.)	Then they'll catch me.
M	RAIZO (V.O.)	They'll put you in the box.
M	KIRIKO (V.O.)	Yes. They will.
M	RAIZO	I told you. I tried to warn you. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 69. CONTINUED: 85
F	KIRIKO	...yes, you did....
M	RAIZO	But you did it anyway. Why?
F	KIRIKO	Why am I in here for watering my tree...or why are you out there... watering me?
F	MIKA	Could you give us a moment?
M	GUARD	Negative. Not safe ma'am.
F	MIKA	If he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago.
M	GUARD	Sorry ma'am. Maslow okayed the water. That's it.
F	MIKA	Hi...you looked thirsty.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	I'm sorry...I didn't know about this.
M	RAIZO	I know.
F	MIKA	You do? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 70. CONTINUED: 86
M	RAIZO	The only time you lied to me was when you told me your size.
F	MIKA	How did you know that?
M	RAIZO	Your heart. It is special.
F	MIKA	You know about my heart?
M	RAIZO	Hearts speak truer than tongues.
F	MIKA	Listen, Maslow is on our side. He's going to try to help you.
M	RAIZO	It's too late. All that matters is the Rihla. Get the manuscript before they get here.
F	MIKA	The Hanta Kirra?
M	RAIZO	Hurry.
F	MIKA	Ryan, can I talk to you?
M	MASLOW	We have to do this again, Coretti?
F	MIKA	No sir. I just...I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71. CONTINUED: 87
M	MASLOW	I think these gentlemen can handle a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right? See?
F	MIKA	But the situation we discussed-
M	MASLOW	I'm working on that. You have to give me a little time.
F	MIKA	We don't have time.
M	MASLOW	They're not here now.
F	MIKA	They'll be here soon.
M	MASLOW	How soon-
F	MIKA	Raizo--
M	MASLOW	Mika! GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71A. CONTINUED: 89
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	Go with her! Secure the prisoner!
M	EUROPOL WATER GUARD	Hold your fire--
M	EUROPOL GUARD	Christ--
M	EUROPOL WATER GUARD	Good way to get yourself killed, Agent Coretti.
M	EUROPOL #2	What the fuck's with the lights?
M	EUROPOL GUARD	We got some guys in pajamas comin' to play spin the bottle.
M	EUROPOL #2	Huh huh. I got something they can wrap their lips around.
F	MIKA	I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner.
M	RAIZO	Mika! GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71B. CONTINUED: 89A
M	EUROPOL WATER GUARD	No ma'am. Those aren't our orders.
M	RAIZO	You've got to get out of here!
F	MIKA	Not without you.
M	RAIZO	Then we all die together.
M	EUROPOL AGENT 2	Don't see shit--
M	POINT MAN	Is that..?
F	MIKA	Fuck me...
M	EUROPOL #2	What the fu--
M	EUROPOL GUARD	They're not showing up on IR!

M	MASLOW	Good, stay clear.

M	MASLOW	Not yet. We're heading upstairs now.
F	MIKA	Where's Raizo GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 77. CONTINUED: 95
M	MASLOW	He took off. We think they went after him.
M	TAKESHI	This is the end for you, brother.
F	MIKA	Raizo! What were you doing in the street?!
M	RAIZO	...waiting for you...
F	MIKA	You have to go to a hospital.
M	RAIZO	No. Not a hospital. Another place.
M	HERBALIST	What is it? What -- GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 79.
M	RAIZO	...dong-xia leaves...three of the lo-chan...dragon root...
M	HERBALIST	You should not mix these. Very dangerous.
M	HERBALIST (CONT'D)	If you are in pain...if you wish to die...there are other ways, this will be agony --
M	RAIZO	No...it will save me....
M	HERBALIST	It will? You're sure? Let me write this down.
M	RAIZO	Hot water.
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	I have to sleep now...a day at least.
F	MIKA	A day?!? What should I do?
M	RAIZO	...keep moving... GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 80. CONTINUED: 100
F	MIKA	I'll have him to go. Can you...help me to the car?
M	MASLOW	Mika, where are you?
F	MIKA	Moving. He told me to keep moving.
M	MASLOW	He's still alive?
F	MIKA	After a fashion.
M	MASLOW	Let us bring you in.
F	MIKA	Not this time.
M	MASLOW	Mika, the situation's a little different. Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 81. CONTINUED: 102
F	MIKA	Do you have the manuscript?
M	MASLOW	...negative. They got to my office. Everything's gone.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	Mika, it's gonna be all right. We'll find them.
F	MIKA	...but I promised...
M	MASLOW	We'll keep your promise. They're too many people involved now. It's just a matter of time.
F	MIKA	I don't think we have much time...
M	MASLOW	Just tell me where you are.
M	MASLOW (CONT'D)	Mika? Mika? Dammit. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 82. CONTINUED: 105
F	MIKA	I know you can't hear me, so I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm going to say it anyway.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	I'm a forensic researcher, okay? That's like a fancy way of saying I'm a librarian. By myself I can't do anything to help you.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	I wanted to think you for saving my life.
M	MIKA (CONT'D)	And I hope you can forgive me for this.
M	AIDE	Agent Maslow, the tracking device--

F	KIRIKO	Because my heart is telling me too.
M	RAIZO	The Hanta Kirra will come for you.
F	KIRIKO	Then they will come.
M	RAIZO	You know the law. He will cut your heart from your chest.
F	KIRIKO	No...He can never touch my heart.
M	KIRIKO (CONT'D)	Come with me.
M	RAIZO	Where? What is out there?
F	KIRIKO	Life.
M	RAIZO	...My life is here.
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	Why are you doing this?
F	KIRIKO	Because I can't watch you become something you are not.
M	OZUNU (V.O.)	We have been betrayed.
M	OZUNU	A child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us. She refused these gifts. Rejected our clan. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 85. CONTINUED: 114
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Hers is a shame that can only be purged with blood. You who returned her shall have this honor.
M	OZUNU	You are Ozunu. Your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the Clan. This is our deepest truth. Because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 86. CONTINUED: 115
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets blood. This is the way of the Nine Clans. This is the way of the Ninja.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	I have waited many years for this moment. I have dreamed it, many times. You will suffer for seven days, one day for each year you defied me.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	For seven days, we will...take...from you, as I have just done. Everyone here will take from you. Piece by piece. You will live through it all, you will feel through it all. You will watch as the birds fight over the pieces.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	You will know pain like no other human being has ever known. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 87. CONTINUED: (2) 115

M	TAKESHI	Father... GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 88. CONTINUED: (3) 115
M	MASLOW	No more grenades, not until we get the children out!
M	RAIZO	What took you?
F	MIKA	You knew I'd come?
M	RAIZO	Just because I was asleep doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.
M	RAIZO (CONT'D)	And I forgive you. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 89.
M	TAKESHI	Come, little brother, let us play like old times
M	TAKESHI (CONT'D)	No death tasted as sweet as hers.
M	TAKESHI (CONT'D)	I watched you die when I pierced her heart. You have always been too weak to be Ozunu. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 90. CONTINUED: 116
M	OZUNU	You have not forgotten your training. You will always be mine, child.
M	OZUNU (CONT'D)	Perhaps this is the best way for you to die.
M	RAIZO	The breath I take after you are dead, will be the first of my life. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 91. CONTINUED: 117

M	MASLOW	How can you be sure?
M	RAIZO	Her heart is special.
F	MIKA	Medic! Over here now!
M	MASLOW	Is she going to be okay?
M	MEDIC	I don't know...she's got a hole right through the middle of her heart...but shes not really bleeding, that badly... GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 94. CONTINUED: (2) 120

M	MASLOW	...you gotta be fucking kidding me.
F	MIKA	...Raizo?
M	MASLOW	He said you saved his life. So you kept your promise. Can we go home now? You shouldn't do that.
F	KIRIKO	I believe the heart of a tree knows which way it needs to grow. Trees don't have hearts.
