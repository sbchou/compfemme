M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	HITLER (V.O.)	My comrades. Once again - I don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life. I speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history...
M	TRESCKOW	Managing the Führer's security must be quite an undertaking.
M	BRANDT	Irregularity is the Führer's precaution of choice.
M	TRESCKOW	I can assure you he's safe here. Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.
M	TRESCKOW (CONT'D)	I understand you're returning to Berlin this afternoon...
M	TRESCKOW (CONT'D)	Could I trouble you to deliver a package to Colonel Stieff?
M	TRESCKOW	With my regards to Colonel Stieff.
M	BRANDT	Cointreau? You better hope I don't get thirsty on the flight.
M	TRESCKOW	He's... landed.
M	AIDE	What about the...
M	TRESCKOW	Get me Colonel Brandt... Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you landed safely... I hate to trouble you but there's been a bit of a mix up. It seems you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff. You... do still have the package?
M	TRESCKOW (CONT'D)	I can be at your office first thing tomorrow morning to pick it up. Terribly sorry for the inconvenience... Thank you.
M	AIDE	Do you think he knows?
M	TRESCKOW	There's only one way to be sure...
M	OFFICER	What happened?
M	TRESCKOW	I can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction. First the beer hall, Memorial Day - now this. Someone is watching over that sonofabitch, I swear it.
M	OLBRICHT	We've been discovered.
M	TRESCKOW	What makes you think-
M	OLBRICHT	Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo came for him last night.
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	Did you hear what I said?
M	TRESCKOW	The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything. Find a replacement.
M	OLBRICHT	There's no one we can trust. Not in Berlin.
M	TRESCKOW	Then stop looking in Berlin.
M	SENTRY	Your pistol please.
M	BRANDT	You'll forgive me, General. This little round-up has had me writing reports all day.
M	TRESKOW	Round-up?
M	BRANDT	Dissenters. A plot against the Führer.
M	TRESKOW	Who would even have the balls?
M	BRANDT	You'd be surprised, the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich.
M	TRESKOW	Only if the Führer were dead, of course.
M	BRANDT	Of course. It's one thing to think you know what's right. What matters is having the strength to do it.
M	BRANDT (CONT'D)	Is this what you've come for? Perhaps we should open it.
M	TRESCKOW	I beg your pardon.
M	BRANDT	You've come a long way. You must be thirsty.
M	TRESCKOW	I wonder how the Führer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... Colonel Brandt.
M	BRANDT	I took you for another sort, General.
M	TRESCKOW	And I you.
M	YOUNG LIEUTENANT	Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new headquarters has been established at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Now they tell us to disengage - a day late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us-
M	YOUNG LIEUTENANT	Colonel, the enemy is less than five kilometers from here. You've done all you can.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I wonder... Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis?
M	YOUNG LIEUTENANT	To get taken prisoner, it seems.
F	STAUFFENBERG	STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	STAND FAST, I SAID.
F	STAUFFENBERG	NOW.
M	DOCTOR	Mrs. Stauffenberg?
F	NINA	The Colonel's brother, Berthold.
M	DOCTOR	Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and-
F	NINA	I will see my husband now.
M	DOCTOR	He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist. He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We... couldn't save the left eye.
F	NINA	His ring.
M	DOCTOR	I don't-
F	NINA	He had a ring on his right hand. Where is it?
M	DOCTOR	I'm sorry... His hand was amputated in the field... I'm afraid-
F	NINA	Thank you.
M	BERTHOLD	We've lost North Africa. family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of
F	STAUFFENBERG	I don't know what I ever did with ten.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	I'm wanted in Berlin.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Are you asking as a member of the High Command?
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in.
M	OLBRICHT	We could use your help.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm a field officer.
M	OLBRICHT	This war can't be won in the field.
F	STAUFFENBERG	That's unfortunate for me.
M	OLBRICHT	You can't honestly believe you'll make a difference on the front-
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm a soldier, General. I serve my country.
M	OLBRICHT	It makes no sense. You opposed Hitler, you opposed the war.
F	STAUFFENBERG	The people chose otherwise and here we are. Now we have to win. You know what will happen if we don't.
M	OLBRICHT	If we win, it will still be Hitler's Germany.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We all took an oath, General.
M	OLBRICHT	On behalf of the Führer.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm a twin, you know.
M	OLBRICHT	I... I didn't.
F	STAUFFENBERG	My brother died the day after we were born.
M	OLBRICHT	I'm sorry.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure I was going to die. I tried to think about my wife, my children... But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. How I would finally be with him. How I would finally be whole again...
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	This is my reward for what happened to my men. It's all I deserve.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I don't want the damn th-
M	DOCTOR	When will you be going back to the front?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm not going to the front. I'm needed in Berlin.
M	WITZLEBEN	...He is not a man, he's a lunatic. He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck. He has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate. His only passion is complete control. How can you expect to reason with him?
M	GOERDELER	After this most recent failure I'd say we've no other choice.
M	WITZLEBEN	Confront Hitler now and you'll end up with piano wire for a neck-tie. Our only option is the central solution.
M	GOERDELER	He's a man like any other. Flesh and blood. Take him head on and-
M	TRESCKOW	I'll say this for you, Doctor... You're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler's place.
M	GOERDELER	When that day comes, I'll be sure to remember you.
M	TRESCKOW	I doubt you'll remember much of anything.
M	GOERDELER	Dammit, Tresckow-
M	OLBRICHT	Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry. Colonel, may I introduce-
F	STAUFFENBERG	These men need no introduction.
M	BECK	I apologize for this unfortunate... spectacle. On behalf of everyone, welc-
M	GOERDELER	I haven't welcomed him. Not yet. Where does he stand?
M	TRESCKOW	For God's sake-
M	GOERDELER	He's a field officer. He knows the army better than any of us. I want to hear his opinion.
M	TRESCKOW	All right. What do you think, Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him to resign? Or the central solution?
M	GOERDELER	"Central Solution." You soldiers are all the same. Say what you mean.
M	WITZLEBEN	That's a laugh coming from a politician.
M	GOERDELER	The army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins.
M	TRESCKOW	They follow a butcher now. What difference does it-
F	STAUFFENBERG	What makes you think the army will follow you at all?
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Oust him, kill him. That isn't what matters. How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler is gone?
M	GOERDELER	I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you are in the presence of men who would have been Hitler's inner circle. Instead we resigned. We put our principles above personal gain.
M	WITZLEBEN	We have the have the respect of the people. And the army.
F	STAUFFENBERG	With all respect, sir, you put too much faith in your popularity. All of you do.
M	GOERDELER	Now see here, Colonel-
F	STAUFFENBERG	You said yourself, I'm a field officer. You all may understand government, but I know the men. A great many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the Reich. That kind of fear won't just die with Hitler. And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. Authority. And if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all. They were fooled into following Hitler... How will you fool them - force them - into following you?
M	CHILDREN	PAPA.
F	STAUFFENBERG	What are you doing here? I thought I left you in Bamberg. It's a wonderful surprise. Thank you, brother.
M	CHILDREN	MAMA, COME DOWN. PAPA IS HERE. PAPA
M	BERTHOLD	What do you mean you quit?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I came to join the Resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians.
M	BERTHOLD	Beck is a just and capable man. As for Goerdeler, well, he's popular. He'll make a good Chancellor.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately I have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny.
M	BERTHOLD	You can't blame the people for this. You have to see the beginning of something to know how it'll end. It's no different than a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Plenty of people thought-
M	BERTHOLD	The greatest offenders are not the ones who thought better but the ones who sensed better.
F	STAUFFENBERG	What are you trying to say?
M	BERTHOLD	I seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig their own graves. You said then that Hitler should be removed. An officer's duty, you said. What's changed?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him.
M	BERTHOLD	Perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed.
M	BERTHOLD (CONT'D)	Perhaps it only matters that you try. Don't you see? Someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan.
M	BERTHOLD	Then give them one. Find a way.
M	BERTHOLD (CONT'D)	Evil happens when good men do nothing.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Children, that is far too-
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Air-raid.
M	STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)	Valkyrie.
M	OLBRICHT	We've already considered Valkyrie. It isn't suitable.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Not as it's currently written.
M	GOERDELER	Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?
M	TRESCKOW	Operation Valkyrie.
M	TRESCKOW (CONT'D)	The Reserve Army has thousands of men all over the city - most of them not even in uniform. Valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency. Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed.
M	GOERDELER	And what use is that to us?
F	STAUFFENBERG	The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command.
M	OLBRICHT	Yes, of course, but- Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup?
M	OLBRICHT	They would declare a military state of emergency.
M	TRESCKOW	And initiate Operation Valkyrie.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Hitler's own Reserve Army, using Hitler's own plan and under our command, would automatically seize power in Berlin...
M	GOERDELER	While we put a new government in place.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Precisely. It will seem as though we're fighting for Hitler Government, not against it.
M	GOERDELER	But only if Hitler's dead. That is what you're saying, isn't it? The central solution.
M	GOERDELER (CONT'D)	How else will you make people believe the SS is trying to seize power?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm afraid it's the only way.
M	GOERDELER	I'm disappointed in you, Colonel. I thought a man of your background would appreciate a more-
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second.
M	GOERDELER	Yes, but-
F	STAUFFENBERG	And you're neither, Doctor. Now if you want to be Chancellor, you'll do as you're told.
M	BECK	Can this plan be made to work?
M	TRESCKOW	Rewriting the order is one thing - distributing it is another. A bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it fails. In this case we'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason. It's the best idea we've heard yet.
M	OLBRICHT	There is one... small problem.
M	TRESCKOW	Fromm...
M	GOERDELER	Who is Fromm? Commander of the Home Army. Olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert, but only Fromm can actually initiate Valkyrie.
M	BECK	Can we get to him?
M	OLBRICHT	He's a careerist pig.
F	STAUFFENBERG	But one who's gone as high as he can go in Hitler's Army. It's no secret he's not happy about it.
M	TRESCKOW	Perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light.
M	BECK	We don't seem to have a choice. Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie. Get him.
M	KEITEL	You're a woman, Fromm. And a fat one at that. I'd have you sent to the front if I didn't think you'd surrender just to be Montgomery's whore.
M	HERBER	The... General will see you now.
M	FROMM	What is it you want?
M	FROMM (CONT'D)	Well, Olbricht? Speak up.
M	OLBRICHT	I wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg.
M	FROMM	Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd offer my hand but you might not give it back.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and
M	FROMM	About time they put a man with balls in this office. Have a seat. You too, if you must.
M	FROMM (CONT'D)	They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel. Not that you don't seem to have good reason.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision.
M	FROMM	In the field, you mean.
F	STAUFFENBERG	In Berlin.
M	FROMM	I take it that's why you're here. To make decisions.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs.
M	FROMM	They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly.
M	FROMM	Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel?
F	STAUFFENBERG	That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander.
M	FROMM	Supreme Commander, you say.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Second only to the Chancellor.
M	FROMM	If only I were that man... This war would be going quite differently.
M	OLBRICHT	We were thinking the very same thing.
M	and Stauffenberg steel their nerves -	
M	FROMM	I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath. That said, I'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again. Am I clear?
M	STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT	Yes, sir.
M	FROMM	Tell your friends that I always come down on the right side. And as long as the Führer is alive, you know what side that is. Heil Hitler.
M	OLBRICHT	I think that went rather well.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Yes... Quite.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Were you followed?
M	TRESCKOW	Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half to death.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We'll be closer than that before we're finished.
M	TRESCKOW	Looking this over, I'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave. I've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers. Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested... or shot.
F	STAUFFENBERG	If anyone comes to you, play ignorant. Just tell them-
M	FRAULEIN OVEN	I'll tell that I was serving the German people. Then I'll tell them to go to hell.
M	TRESCKOW	To Operation Valkyrie. I've been transferred to the front.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Why didn't you tell me?
M	TRESCKOW	Would you have stayed?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Do you think Fromm reported us?
M	TRESCKOW	It's more likely just... an unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it doesn't matter. You wrote the orders. You know them better than anyone.
F	STAUFFENBERG	You don't mean to say-
M	TRESCKOW	I'm appointing you military leader of the Resistance. Beck agrees.
F	STAUFFENBERG	But Olbricht-
M	TRESCKOW	We both know Olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine. No. It's you.
M	TRESCKOW (CONT'D)	One more thing. You were right what you said that first night. It's not enough to kill Hitler. We need to isolate his chain of command. The slightest confusion could crush us. We need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash.
F	STAUFFENBERG	That greatly limits our options of but it's the only way.
M	TRESCKOW	How will you do it?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Perhaps it's better I don't say.
M	TRESCKOW	God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men.
M	TRESCKOW (CONT'D)	I have a feeling that for Germany it may come down to one.
M	FELLGIEBEL	You realize how close I am to Hitler. With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Why haven't you then?
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of.
M	FELLGIEBEL	But you know. And when the SS catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread. It'll be a crime just to have known you then. I warn you. If it means protecting myself, I will expose you. Do not try to contact me again.
F	STAUFFENBERG	You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as-
M	FELLGIEBEL	So you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his Führer and assume his actions will show you his heart. It's not that simple. It is to me.
M	FELLGIEBEL	For the last time, don't push me to make a decision.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I have no choice. It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	You want us to succeed. Don't you?
M	FELLGIEBEL	And what if you do, eh? What then? Will you be any different from Hitler? What of his Reich, his people, the very momentum of history? Will all of that let you be something he isn't?
F	STAUFFENBERG	No.
M	FELLGIEBEL	There it is.
F	STAUFFENBERG	But my pregnant wife, our four children, the Germany I first swore to defend... They demand that I be something different. They demand that I fight for their future even if it means...
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Even if it means that I never see them again.
M	DRUNKEN OFFICER	Are you two finished or just getting started?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Leave us, please.
M	OLBRICHT	You play the part of bureaucrat beautifully.
F	STAUFFENBERG	It's the only time I can relax.
M	OLBRICHT	There's a man here to interview as your adjutant.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Adjut- What for?
M	OLBRICHT	No one told you? You've been promoted Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.
F	STAUFFENBERG	For Christ's sake. Don't I have enough to do?
M	OLBRICHT	Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities don't count as service to the Reich.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'll refuse the promotion.
M	OLBRICHT	You'll do no such thing.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Dammit, I can't handle the work I already-
M	OLBRICHT	This is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of. You're in the inner circle now - with genuine access to Hitler, his advisors, his schedule... We need this.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We're not ready. We're moving too fast.
M	OLBRICHT	Not half as fast as the Allies. An invasion is coming, Colonel. Any day now. We must act and we must act soon.
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	Tresckow may have left you in charge of the "central solution," but in this world I still outrank you. You will accept the appointment. Is that understood?
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	Now. The new man is waiting outside. He comes highly recommended. He might even be an ideal candidate.
F	STAUFFENBERG	For what?
M	OLBRICHT	We still need an assassin.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Be seated.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Do you know how this war will end, Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung... And the man will be hung.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Bottom line. I'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in? And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would
M	HAEFTEN	For anything, sir. Anything at all.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Anything is a very dangerous word.
M	NEWSCASTER (V.O.)	The Allied Forces have blundered into the trap awaiting them on the beaches of Normandy - heroically repelled by the combined might of the German Army. It is a glorious day for the Reich. At long last the craven enemy has come to Europe to face their inevitable defeat at the hands of-
M	HAEFTEN	Five thousand ships, one-hundred thousand men from the combined Allied forces.
F	STAUFFENBERG	What about the Panzer divisions in-
M	HAEFTEN	They were never dispatched. Word is Hitler took a sleeping pill. His staff was afraid to wake him.
F	STAUFFENBERG	First Africa, now France.
M	HAEFTEN	The Russians bearing down from the East.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe.
M	HAEFTEN	Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe he'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We'll see if I can't convince him. You don't need to search him.
M	HERBER	Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest. The hero of Africa.
M	FROMM	For God's sake, Stauffenberg, you're-
M	FROMM (CONT'D)	... they're waiting for you. have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi would never know the tide of the war had just
M	FROMM	Mein Führer... I wish to present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - our new Chief of General Staff for the Replacement Army.
M	HITLER	May I say, I am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much for Germany. If only more of my officers were like you.
M	HITLER (CONT'D)	Let this man stand as an example to all of you. He is the ideal German officer.
M	FROMM	Mein Führer, we have asked Stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army to support those in Normandy.
M	HITLER	Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will no longer be necessary. General Goering has assured me that Normandy is under control.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Mein Führer, if I may... The situation in Normandy is-
M	KEITEL	You're dismissed, Stauffenberg.
F	STAUFFENBERG	But-
M	KEITEL	Send your man home, Fromm. Then bring us some brandy.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Heil Hitler.
M	FROMM	I don't know what you've got brewing and I don't want to know... But when the music stops, I'd be much obliged if Keitel should find himself without a chair. Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a
F	STAUFFENBERG	They're all insane. Every one of them except for Speer, and he's nothing but an architect.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Tell Beck we've found our assassin... I'll do it myself.
M	BECK	Out of the question. It won't work. We need you here in Berlin.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Who else, then? Who can even get as close?
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Valkyrie is very clear. Once the order is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me. Orders are not enough. They need a man to follow. The right man.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is-
M	BECK	Three very crucial hours.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We both know there's no other way.
M	BECK	I'll tell the others- handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his
M	BECK (CONT'D)	I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I won't be there to see it.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Nonsense. You're stronger than you think. You might just be the strongest one of all.
F	NINA	...After that I thought I'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus?
M	NINA (CONT'D)	Have you heard a word I said?
F	STAUFFENBERG	The country... Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while.
F	NINA	Does this have something to do with... your work?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise.
F	NINA	How long until... until we see you?
F	STAUFFENBERG	A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family.
F	NINA	And if things... don't go well?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I love you, Nina.
F	NINA	And I love you... What-
M	CHILDREN	PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. (Etc.)
F	NINA	Go be with your children.
M	MERTZ	Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W. Enough explosive to cripple a panzer. Your detonators. Your fuses. British time pencils. This acid capsule is your trigger. When you're ready to arm, attach the detonator to the bottom of the time pencil, like so... ...Insert the entire device into either end of the plastic-W, crush the acid capsule and you're live. When the acid eats through the wire holding back the trigger spring... Well... You'll want to be very far away.
M	OLBRICHT	What if they search your bag?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'm one of the inner circle now. They'll make sure I am who I am. Beyond that, they won't touch me. How much time do I have?
M	MERTZ	Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay. But with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf's Lair, I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops.
M	HAEFTEN	That's... hardly precise.
M	MERTZ	This is state of the art. You can have small or precise. Not both.
M	OLBRICHT	Might this be just a little too small?
M	MERTZ	The explosion won't do the killing. The air in the room will.
M	MERTZ (CONT'D)	Hitler's bunker is constructed of reenforced concrete. A steel door, no windows. Just one of these explosives in a space like that will cause tremendous air pressure. Enough to instantly kill everyone present. The second charge will be entirely redundant.
M	OLBRICHT	Of course, I'm all for redundancy. However... If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive, what then?
F	STAUFFENBERG	We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair in communications. He'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world.
M	OLBRICHT	Just how did you manage that?
F	STAUFFENBERG	It's my job, isn't it? While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum.
M	MERTZ	But as you said yourself it would take a miracle. Anyone in that bunker when just one of these goes off is not coming out alive.
M	OLBRICHT	Himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well. Don't proceed unless you can get them both.
F	STAUFFENBERG	That could be difficult.
M	OLBRICHT	Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place?
F	STAUFFENBERG	This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it?
M	OLBRICHT	The members are in total agreement on this.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Fucking politicians. I'll hold off if the decision is unanimous. And I want another man on the committee. A soldier.
M	OLBRICHT	And just who this soldier be?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Him.
M	OLBRICHT	Him?
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	This is General Olbricht. Order the Guard Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness. Stand by for Operation Valkyrie.
M	HELM	Lieutenant.
M	HAANS	What about it?
M	HELM	This order is calling the Reserve Army for some sort of stand-by action... in Berlin.
M	HAANS	Looks like a drill of some kind.
M	HELM	Valkyrie? I've never heard of that.
M	HAANS	Send the order through, Sergeant.
M	REMER	What do you suppose this is all about?
M	HAGEN	Probably just a drill.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Drive on.
M	HAEFTEN	Your man?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Himmler. Where is Himmler?
M	KEITEL	...Now for the first order of business. Fromm, I believe you will brief us on blocking divisions for the Eastern Front...
M	MERTZ	General Olbricht's Office. Hold the line. Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at the briefing. He wants to proceed.
M	OLBRICHT	Call Beck.
M	BECK	Beck.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	Himmler is not in the briefing.
M	MERTZ (ON PHONE)	They say no. Wait.
F	STAUFFENBERG	What do you say?
M	MERTZ	I say do it.
F	STAUFFENBERG	My briefcase.
M	KEITEL	...Gentleman. You are dismissed.
M	FROMM	That call better have been important.
M	FREYEND	Your bag... Colonel.
M	HASE	What the hell is going on? My men have been standing here for an hour. I don't know what to tell them. At ease, gentlemen.
M	OLBRICHT	This has been a drill. You're all to be commended for your quick response. Dismissed.
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	HEIL HITLER.
M	SOLDIERS	HEIL HITLER.
M	HAGEN	What did I tell you? A drill.
M	OLBRICHT	That man there. Who is he?
M	HASE	Major Remer? He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion. What about him?
M	OLBRICHT	Get rid of him.
M	HASE	Remer? Don't worry about him. He's an order taker. To the bone.
M	HERBER	The General will see you now.
M	FROMM	How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby without my knowledge. You damn near cost me my commission. What in God's name made you think you even had the authority?
M	OLBRICHT	It was only a drill. An exercise.
M	FROMM	DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We both know it was no fucking drill.
F	STAUFFENBERG	General, if I may-
M	FROMM	You may not, Colonel. You may not do anything. Because now you've not only shown me you can't deliver, you've painted a target on my back. If I so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again, I'll personally have you both arrested. Do I make myself abundantly clear?
M	STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT	Yes, sir.
M	FROMM	Heil Hitler.
M	OLBRICHT	Heil Hitler.
M	FROMM	I'll hear you say it, Colonel.
F	STAUFFENBERG	HEIL HITLER.
M	GOERDELER	The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... IF WE OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN FUCKING BERLIN.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician.
M	GOERDELER	I don't think I am alone when I say your judgement is in question. I would like to take a vote.
M	BECK	Carl. I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL STAUFFENBERG.
M	BECK	Carl, if I may have a word with you in private.
M	GOERDELER	If you have something to say, Ludwig, say it here. Say it now.
M	BECK	Very well. There's no need to vote.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	I consider you a friend. And I look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men. But you've become a liability.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	I'm sorry it has to be this way.
M	GOERDELER	Wha... What are you saying?
M	BECK	Fellgiebel informed me this evening... Himmler's issued an order for your arrest. You'll have to leave Germany. Tonight. When we've succeeded with the central solution you'll return as Chancellor. Until then-
M	GOERDELER	This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T IT? You can't just get rid of me like this. I am the man Germany will follow. I'm... I... Ludwig, I-
M	BECK	Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with anyone.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	No more indecision. From now on, Stauffenberg has discretion.
M	OLBRICHT	I can't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through. If he fails to-
F	STAUFFENBERG	I'll do my job. You just take Berlin.
M	STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)	I'd like to place a call to Bamberg, please.
M	BECK	Have you made your peace with God, then?
F	STAUFFENBERG	As best I can.
M	BECK	Then you have nothing to fear.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I know the soldier inside me is a traitor. I wonder how I'll be judged as a man.
M	BECK	By history?
F	STAUFFENBERG	By God.
M	BECK	In the end, we answer only to ourselves.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	Did you reach your wife?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get through.
M	BECK	Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg. They're safe. You've seen to that. To think... You came to us a wounded soldier from Africa. Now... Now you are both the architect and the assassin. I'm still trying to understand how this came to be.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Like a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head... What's that?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Nothing...
M	BECK	Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	We can begin.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	Hitler has scheduled a military briefing for today at one o'clock. Stauffenberg will strike regardless of who else is present. As Beck speaks, we see how things should play out...
M	BECK (V.O.)	Once in position, he will signal us once to alert the troops and again after the flash...
M	BECK (V.O.)	Assuming Fromm refuses to join us, Olbricht will take Command of the Reserve Army and initiate Operation Valkyrie.
M	BECK (V.O.)	Then he'll notify all district commanders between Paris and Berlin that the SS is attempting to seize power. The Reserve Army will arrest all SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials.
M	BECK (V.O.)	When the time is right, Witzleben and I will arrive at the War Ministry and assume the roles of Commander of the Armed Forces and Head of State, respectively.
M	BECK (V.O.)	With Berlin secured, Goerdeler will return and address the nation as our new Chancellor. Then, God willing, we can negotiate a truce with the Allies and spare Europe from total destruction.
M	BECK	Gentlemen, this is the most important day of your lives. Long live sacred Germany.
M	MERTZ	Put the Reserve Army on standby alert.
M	OLBRICHT	Not until I hear from Stauffenberg. Not until I'm sure. But that's not what he-
M	OLBRICHT	Noted, Colonel. Thank you.
M	FREYEND	Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army.
M	OFFICER #1	Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an honor. They say you're the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army single-hand-
F	STAUFFENBERG	Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here.
M	FREYEND	Let me take that for you.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Colonel Stauffenberg?
M	FELLGIEBEL	At east, Gentlemen. General Fellgiebel, communications. I just wanted to meet the hero of Africa... And see if there's anything you need.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the Führer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me.
M	FELLGIEBEL	Of course, Colonel.
M	KEITEL	Gentlemen. The meeting has been pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Will Mussolini be in the briefing?
M	KEITEL	I only wish he were. Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard. change my shirt.
M	FREYEND	Please, do be quick. You heard the General.
M	HAEFTEN	You're arming them... now?
F	STAUFFENBERG	No room for error this time. Assume I have ten minutes in this heat.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Two minutes for the walk, one for the security check and one to the bunker. Three minutes for the walk back. That's seven.
M	HAEFTEN	Leaving just three minutes to place the bomb.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Plenty of time.
M	HAEFTEN	If the bomb goes off in ten.
M	FREYEND	Major Freyend speaking. Stauffenberg? Yes, he's arrived... They are on their way now.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Dammit man, what is it?
M	FREYEND	General Keitel insists that the Colonel please hurry.
M	HAEFTEN	The Colonel is changing, Major. You understand this can be difficult.
F	STAUFFENBERG	See that the car is ready.
M	HAEFTEN	But sir-
F	STAUFFENBERG	I have everything I need, Lieutenant. Thank you.
M	FREYEND	Please. Let me help you with that.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I can manage, thank you.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Where are they going?
M	FREYEND	It's too hot. The briefing has been moved to the conference hut.
M	FREYEND (CONT'D)	Sir, your briefcase. I insist.
F	STAUFFENBERG	My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the Führer as possible.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin...
M	GENERAL	The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory... but they need reinforcements.
M	KEITEL	Please pardon our tardiness... You remember Colonel Stauffenberg?
M	GENERAL	As you can see, Mein Führer, the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical...
M	ADAM	General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Colonel... Colonel, you forgot your-
M	GENERAL	...And now I believe Colonel Stauffenberg will present us with his deployment for the Replacement Army should the unthinkable occur and the Russians reach-
M	FREYEND	Where the hell is Stauffenberg?
F	STAUFFENBERG	Contact General Olbricht in Berlin. Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever all communications.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Drive. LIEUTENANT.
M	FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)	I said Olbricht. General Olbricht at the War Ministry. The call is urgent.
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	What the hell just happened?
M	FELLGIEBEL	What does it look like? The Führer is-
M	FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)	Alive...
F	STAUFFENBERG	We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the Führer.
M	FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)	I am calling from The Wolf's Lair with urgent news for the General. Something terrible has happened...
M	FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)	The Führer is still alive.
M	VOICE (ON PHONE)	I'm sorry. Please come again.
M	FELLGIEBEL	Sever all communications.
M	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Sir?
M	FELLGIEBEL	DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, DAMMIT. JUST DO IT.
M	MERTZ	I didn't hear you. Come again. Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL.
M	OLBRICHT	Well, what did he say?
M	MERTZ	I... couldn't be sure. It sounded as though he said... Hitler is still alive.
M	OLBRICHT	Get him back on the line.
M	MERTZ	Sir... The bomb did go off. That much was clear. Fellgiebel's next step will be to sever all communications.
M	MERTZ (CONT'D)	Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit. We initiate Valkyrie regardless.
M	OLBRICHT	Only Fromm can initiate. You know that.
M	MERTZ	Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead. Or arrest him. But do it now. Sir... Did you hear me? You have to give the order to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only-
M	OLBRICHT	I'm not doing anything until I talk to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the phone. NOW.
M	KOLBE	No one gets in or out.
F	STAUFFENBERG	We're on orders from the Führer. We have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside.
M	KOLBE	I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are-
F	STAUFFENBERG	Get me General Keitel.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Yes... General Keitel. Stauffenberg here. I can't get past the outer gate. A Sergeant...
M	KOLBE	Kolbe.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting out... Yes. Yes. Maybe you can explain it to him. Stauffenberg holds out the phone - staring hard,
M	KOLBE	That won't be necessary, Colonel.
M	MERTZ (V.O.)	Every second we stand here arguing is a second lost.
M	OLBRICHT	I can't initiate Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler's dead. It's too great a risk.
M	MERTZ	What about Stauffenberg? What about his risk? He did his part and now you're abandoning him.
M	OLBRICHT	Watch yourself, Colonel.
M	MERTZ	Shouldn't you be consulting Beck?
M	OLBRICHT	I know just what Beck will say. He's a dying man. What does he have to lose?
M	MERTZ	At least put the Reserve Army on alert.
M	OLBRICHT	I can't cover up another false alarm. When Stauffenberg returns, when he gives me confirmation. Then we'll proceed.
M	MERTZ	And where are you going?
M	OLBRICHT	The same place you are. Lunch.
M	ADAM	The one-eyed Colonel...
M	KEITEL	Stauffenberg.
M	ADAM	He left the building very abruptly - just before the explosion.
M	KEITEL	Several men left the building before the explosion.
M	ADAM	Yes, sir. Of course. But...
M	KEITEL	But what? Spit it out, man.
M	ADAM	Well. The Colonel left his hat. Freyend barges in, also banged up. With him is Kretz -
M	FREYEND	Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say.
M	MERTZ	Orders from General Olbricht.
M	HELM	Send it through. But keep me informed.
M	HAGEN	Here we go again. Major Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time
F	STAUFFENBERG	Quiet, isn't it?
M	HAEFTEN	I'll see where our driver is.
M	HAEFTEN (INTO PHONE)	You mean to tell me that the alert is only just going out- This is Stauffenberg. Get me General Olbricht.
M	OLBRICHT	Explain this.
M	MERTZ	Someone had to do something while you were playing dead.
M	OLBRICHT	We don't know that the Führer is not alive. We don't know any-
M	MERTZ	THIS IS ABOUT GERMANY, FOR GOD'S SAKE. NOT YOU. BE A MAN.
M	MERTZ (CONT'D)	General Olbricht's office.
M	MERTZ (CONT'D)	Stauffenberg for you, sir.
F	STAUFFENBERG	It's been three hours, Olbricht. What the hell have you been doing?
M	OLBRICHT	We've had no confirmation that-
F	STAUFFENBERG	Dammit man, I saw the explosion myself. Nothing else matters now. We are committed.
M	OLBRICHT	Dear God.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Now where is Fromm? Is he with us or did you-
M	OLBRICHT	I- No one has spoken to him yet.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind Germany. Never mind Europe. Your life is at stake now, do you understand? If you want to live through the night you'll do exactly as I say.
M	OLBRICHT	I understand.
F	STAUFFENBERG	The second you hang up the phone, initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm's name. Then go over to his office in force, give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest. Do I make myself perfectly clear?
M	OLBRICHT	I understand.
F	STAUFFENBERG	I am at the airfield now. I will be in Fromm's office in fifteen minutes. Be there when I arrive.
M	OLBRICHT	Get Beck and the others. Tell them it's time.
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	This is General Olbricht calling on behalf of General Fromm - Commander of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is dead. A group of radicals from the SS are attempting to seize control of the government. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. All military districts, training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential government offices at once...
M	HELM	The Führer is dead. Long pause. Haans struggles with the sheer size of
M	HAANS	You all know your jobs. Get to work.
M	OPERATOR	Sergeant. This order is signed by Witzleben.
M	HELM	That's ridiculous. He`s not even in the army anymore.
M	HELM (CONT'D)	Pass the order along.
M	FROMM (V.O.)	Who told you the Führer was dead?
M	OLBRICHT	General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair. This is Fromm. Put me through to The Wolf's Lair.
M	OLBRICHT	There's no use calling, all communication lines are-
M	FROMM (INTO PHONE)	Yes. General Fromm for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent.
M	FROMM (ON PHONE)	What's going on up there? The most incredible rumors are circulating in Berlin.
M	KEITEL	I don't know what you mean. Everything's in order here.
M	FROMM	There's talk the Führer's been assassinated.
M	KEITEL	Another failed attempt. The Führer was never in danger. By the way, where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg?
M	FROMM	Stauffenberg? On his way back to Berlin, I should think. Let me know when he arrives. I'd like a word with him.
M	FROMM	Certainly.
M	FROMM (CONT'D)	A false alarm. The Führer is fine.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	That's a lie.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie is in effect.
M	FROMM	OPERATION VAL- WHO GAVE THE ORDER?
F	STAUFFENBERG	You did.
M	FROMM	THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN TREASON.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Be that as it may, the Reserve Army is assuming control here in Berlin. We trust you'll join us.
M	FROMM	Dammit, man. Do you realize what you've done? The Führer is a-
F	STAUFFENBERG	I delivered the bomb myself. I saw the blast. He is dead.
M	FROMM	This can't be happening. It's some kind of joke.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Are you with us or not?
M	FROMM	Colonel, if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once. The rest of you are under arrest.
F	STAUFFENBERG	No, General. You are.
M	FROMM	I don't know where you think this is going, but I suggest you men change into civilian clothes and find a place to hide.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Lock him upstairs in his private quarters. Make sure his phone lines are cut.
F	STAUFFENBERG	You're not in uniform.
M	BECK	This has to be seen as a movement of the people. You're certain he's dead.
M	YOUNG OFFICER	Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're reporting for duty.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you. We're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. Can we count on the police?
M	HELLDORF	There's a lot of talk that Hitler isn't really dead. Is this true?
F	STAUFFENBERG	I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you?
M	HELLDORF	I'm with you.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission. I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed.
M	BECK	Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. We represent a different form of government. We represent what is good and just in Germany.
F	STAUFFENBERG	...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once...
M	HASE	... Completely blockade the government quarters. Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even generals or ministers, should be allowed to pass. You have your orders, gentlemen.
M	HASE (CONT'D)	Is there a problem, Major?
M	REMER	It just all seems very... vague, sir. Protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing-
M	HASE	These are the orders as they were presented to me, Major. Now move.
M	HAGEN	Major Remer. We've just had orders from the War Ministry. The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest.
M	HAGEN (CONT'D)	What is it, Major?
M	REMER	Something just doesn't feel right about this. I would hate to find out I'm being taken advantage of.
M	HAGEN	A coup you think?
M	REMER	Of that I am certain. What I can't say is which side we're on. Get in.
M	REMER (CONT'D)	Take us to the Reichministry. Be quick about it.
F	STAUFFENBERG	Send him in. It's all right. Send him in.
M	FAT GENERAL	Begging your pardon, but I have orders to report to General Fromm.
M	OLBRICHT	General Fromm is no longer in command. I am.
M	FAT GENERAL	I... Beck? What are you- What is going on here?
F	STAUFFENBERG	The Führer is dead. The SS is staging a coup. We've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler's Germany.
M	FAT GENERAL	I'd say there is a coup all right, but it's not the SS.
M	OLBRICHT	You will present these orders to your troops.
M	FAT GENERAL	I will do no such thing without speaking to General Fromm. I swore an oath-
F	STAUFFENBERG	You have your orders. Join us or face the consequences.
M	FAT GENERAL	This is treason. I won't take part. The Führer is not dead. THE FÜHRER IS NOT DEAD.
M	OLBRICHT	STOP THAT MAN.
M	FAT GENERAL	THE FÜHRER IS NOT DEAD. I'VE SWORN AN OATH. YOU ALL HAVE...
F	STAUFFENBERG	Lt. Herber. Come here.
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	Lock him up with Fromm.
M	GOEBBELS	I am ready to be connected.
M	GOEBBELS (CONT'D)	What can I do for you, Major?
M	REMER	Minister Goebbels, my battalion has an order to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest.
M	GOEBBELS	Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major?
M	REMER	Yes, sir.
M	REMER (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	VOICE (ON PHONE)	Do you recognize my voice?
M	REMER	Of course, Mein Führer. Then listen to me very carefully...
M	HAANS	What is it now, Sergeant?
M	HELM	It's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another.
M	HAANS	Our job is not to interpret the orders. Our job is to pass them along. Regardless.
M	HELM	Yes, but sir-
M	HAANS	Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant?
M	REMER	Release these men at once.
M	HAGEN	But these men are part of a coup.
M	REMER	I've just been on the phone with Hitler himself. We are the coup, you idiot. We've been duped.
M	FROMM	Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of this?
M	HERBER	I... I don't know...
M	FROMM	I won't ask you to make a choice. That's for you and you alone. All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself. In time you'll see things for what they truly are. You know where to find me when you do.
M	FROMM (CONT'D)	Lieutenant. Heil Hitler.
M	HERBER	Heil Hitler.
M	GOEBBELS	Have you seen the Führer? Is he-
M	HIMMLER	It seems the conference table shielded him from the blast. He's lucky to be alive. Do you want to tell me what's going on?
M	GOEBBELS	Everything is under control. I've taken charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders. We're turning the tables on these cowards.
M	HIMMLER	I've been sent here personally by the Führer to collect the conspirators. He insists they be taken alive.
M	GOEBBELS	Take this down. By order of Adolf Hitler...
M	HELM	It's a coup all right... And when it's over, we'd better wind up on the right side. Now we can't afford to remain neutral any longer. We have to make a decision.
M	HAANS	Very well. Send all communications from the Wolf's Lair. Stop all communications from Stauffenberg.
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Today an attempt was made on the Führer's life...
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER	...The Führer himself suffered no major injuries and resumed his work immediately...
F	STAUFFENBERG	Send the following teleprint to all Army Commanders... `Broadcast communique not correct. The Führer is dead. Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch.'
M	STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)	I saw the blast...
M	VOICE (O.S.)	What the hell kind of coup is this? eyes turn to find Witzleben. Hours ago he was a
M	WITZLEBEN	The military districts are receiving contradictory reports. I've got men sitting around joking about whose turn it is to arrest whom. Neither the capital nor the radio network are under our control. And where are the troops? You'd think there would be some activity going on in this city. The word is all over the street that Hitler is still alive. We trusted you and you failed us. You should have stayed. To be sure.
M	OLBRICHT (O.S.)	And who would have led the men here in Berlin? You?
M	OLBRICHT (CONT'D)	The Colonel did more than any man could have hoped. If anyone is to blame it's-
F	STAUFFENBERG	Field Marshal Witzleben is right. I am the officer in charge. I am the man responsible. No one else.
M	WITZLEBEN	I'm going home to await my inevitable arrest.
M	OLBRICHT	I'm sorry, Colonel.
M	HERBER	Arm yourselves.
M	REMER	YOU THERE. HALT.
M	HAEFTEN	Thank you, Colonel.
M	HAEFTEN (CONT'D)	Better I die for Germany than for Hitler. Colonel Stauffenberg.
M	REMER	You're under arrest.
M	FROMM	If you have any last messages, you'd better write them now.
F	STAUFFENBERG	My actions speak for me. I'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together.
M	BECK	I'd like a pistol, please.
M	BECK (CONT'D)	For personal reasons.
M	REMER	General, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive.
M	FROMM	Noted, Major. Get on with it then.
M	REMER	But, sir-
M	FROMM	THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR.
M	FROMM (CONT'D)	Continue.
M	BECK	I'm thinking of earlier times...
M	FROMM	Very well then... A court martial, convened by me in the Führer's absence, has pronounced sentence: Colonel Mertz von Quernheim, General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften... And the Colonel, whose name I will not mention, are condemned to death. Take them outside.
F	STAUFFENBERG	The Führer will want to put us on trial, make an example of us. This won't win you any favor. And it won't hide you're involvement.
M	FROMM	Involvement. I don't know what you-
F	STAUFFENBERG	You knew and you did nothing. You're just as guilty as we are. Even more so.
M	FROMM	Spare me, Stauffenberg.
M	those words bring a genuine smile to	
F	STAUFFENBERG	No one will be spared. My comrades. Once again - I don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life.
M	HITLER (V.O.)	I speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history...
M	HITLER (V.O.)	A small clique of ambitious, dishonorable, stupid officers have conspired to eliminate me. Except for a few bruises and burns, I was completely untouched.
M	HITLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I see in this the hand of Providence... directing me to complete my work.
