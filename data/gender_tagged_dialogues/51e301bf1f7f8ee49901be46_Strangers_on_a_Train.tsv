M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MAN'S VOICE (over scene)	Oh, excuse Me!
M	BRUNO	I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines.
M	BRUNO	Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you?
M	BRUNO	I certainly admire people who do things. I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.
M	GUY	How do you do.
M	BRUNO	I don't usually talk so much. Go Ahead and read.
M	GUY	Thanks. tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open
M	BRUNO	It must be pretty exciting to be so important.
M	GUY	A tennis player isn't so important.
M	BRUNO	People who do things are important. I never seem to do anything.
M	BRUNO	I suppose you're going to Southampton -- for the doubles.
M	GUY	You are a tennis fan.
M	BRUNO	Wish I could see you play. But I've got to be back in Washington tomorrow. I live in Arlington, you know.
M	BRUNO	Cigarette?
M	GUY	Not now, thanks. I don't smoke much.
M	BRUNO	I smoke too much.
M	BRUNO	Thanks. Elegant.
M	BRUNO'S VOICE	To G from A. Bet I can guess who A is. SHOT
M	GUY	Yes?
M	BRUNO	Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the sport page and look at the society news. And the pictures. She's very beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.
M	GUY	You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.
M	BRUNO	Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from today's stock reports to Li'l Abner, and I got the answer.
M	BRUNO (CONT'D)	Even news about people I don't know. Like who'd like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce.
M	GUY	Perhaps you read too much.
M	BRUNO	There I go again. Too friendly. I meet someone I' like and open my yap too wide. I'm sorry... the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.
M	GUY	That's all right. Forget it. I guess I'm pretty jumpy.
M	BRUNO	There's a new cure for that. Scotch and plain water. A pair. Double. Only kind of doubles I play.
M	GUY	You'll have to drink both of them.
M	BRUNO	And I can do it. When's the wedding?
M	GUY	What?
M	BRUNO	The wedding. You and Anne Burton. It was in the papers.
M	GUY	It shouldn't have been. Unless they've legalized bigamy overnight.
M	BRUNO	I have a theory about that. I'd like to tell you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the simplest operation. I guess I will.
M	BRUNO	This is wonderful -- having your company all the way to New York.
M	GUY	As a matter of fact, I'm not going direct. I'm stopping off. At Metcalf.
M	BRUNO	Metcalf? What would anybody want to go there for?
M	GUY	It's my home town.
M	BRUNO	Oh, I get it! A little talk with your wife to about the divorce! I suppose she was the girl next door. Held her hand in high school and before you knew it -- hooked! Am I right?
M	GUY	Close enough.
M	BRUNO	Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up -- then we'll have some lunch sent to my compartment.
M	GUY	Thanks very much. But I think I'll go to the dining car. Do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now?
M	WAITER	Not for about twenty minutes I'm afraid, Sir.
M	BRUNO	See? You'll have to lunch with me. Say, waiter, bring me some lamb chops and French fries and chocolate ice cream, Compartment D, Car 121. What'll you have, Guy?
M	GUY	Thanks just the same, but I really don't think --
M	BRUNO	Oh, go on and order.
M	GUY	Well, I'll Just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee.
M	BRUNO	To the next Mrs. Haines.
M	BRUNO	Sure, I went to college. Three of them. Every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in. He finally gave up. He thinks I'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait. You my friend, Guy?
M	GUY	Sure. I'm your friend, Bruno.
M	BRUNO	No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm anything special. Only my mother. My father hates me.
M	GUY	You must be imagining things.
M	BRUNO	And I hate him. He thinks I ought to catch the eight-five bus every morning, punch a timeclock and work my way up selling paint or something. Him -- with all his money!
M	GUY	Well, what do you want to do?
M	BRUNO	You mean before or after I kill him?
M	GUY	Before, of course.
M	BRUNO	I want to do everything. I got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. Have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?
M	GUY	Not lately. BRUNO I did. I flew in a jet plans too. Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill! Almost blow the sawdust out of my head. I'm going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon...
M	GUY	What are you trying prove?
M	BRUNO	I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky. You're smart. Marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?
M	GUY	Marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker?
M	BRUNO	Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend, remember? I'd do anything for you.
M	GUY	Sure, Bruno, sure. We'll be pulling in soon. I've got to change trains.
M	BRUNO	What'd you say her name was -- your wife's?
M	GUY	Miriam.
M	BRUNO	That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines. Played around a lot, I suppose? GUY Let's not talk about it any more.
M	BRUNO	Maybe she'll make more trouble for you.
M	GUY	I don't think so.
M	BRUNO	You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what?
M	GUY	Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we?
M	BRUNO	Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father?
M	GUY	You've been reading too many of these.
M	BRUNO	You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?
M	GUY	No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law.
M	BRUNO	But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with?
M	GUY	You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.
M	BRUNO	Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.
M	GUY	Why?
M	BRUNO	Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce -- Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan...
M	GUY	I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.
M	BRUNO	It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders.
M	GUY	Swap murders?
M	BRUNO	Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours.
M	GUY	We're coming into my station.
M	BRUNO	For example, your wife, my father. Criss-cross.
M	GUY	What?
M	BRUNO	We do talk the same language -- don't we, Guy?
M	GUY	Sure, we talk the same language. Thanks for the lunch.
M	BRUNO	I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself.
M	GUY	Nice meeting you, Bruno.
M	BRUNO	You think my theory is okay, Guy? You like it?
M	GUY	Sure, sure, Bruno. They're all okay.
M	BRUNO	Criss-cross. the train comes in.
M	GUY	Hi, Bill.
M	BAGGAGE MAN	Guy Haines! Good to too you, boy. You be sure to win at Southampton tomorrow, hear me? I've got two dollars on your nose.
M	GUY	Then park these in a lucky spot for a few hours, will you?
M	BAGGAGE MAN	Sure thing.
F	MIRIAM	Even change. Thank you, Madam. Well -- hello, Guy.
M	GUY	You're looking well, Miriam.
F	MIRIAM	So are you. You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends.
M	GUY	What time do we meet your lawyer?
F	MIRIAM	What's your hurry?
M	GUY	My hurry? That's funny, coming from you! You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?
F	MIRIAM	When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous.
M	GUY	I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam. eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved
F	MIRIAM	Let's talk in there.
F	MIRIAM	Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy?
M	GUY	Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. Especially when you're going to have another man's baby.
F	MIRIAM	Do you know, I think you're handsomer than ever?
M	GUY	Let's see your lawyer and get this over with.
F	MIRIAM	Did you bring the money, Guy? Lawyers are expensive.
M	GUY	Here it is.
F	MIRIAM	If I'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn't have run out on you.
M	GUY	What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out with it.
F	MIRIAM	I'm not getting a divorce.
M	GUY	Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn't want this divorce, you did. That's what you've been harping about for the past year.
F	MIRIAM	It's a woman's privilege to change her mind... Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties.
M	GUY	And what do you mean by that?
F	MIRIAM	Don't look so mad, Guy. You always smile when your picture is being taken for the papers. Especially when you have Anne Burton hanging on your arm.
M	GUY	Let's not talk about Anne Burton.
F	MIRIAM	So, it's really serious between you two? Well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. Guy, I'm coming to Washington.
M	GUY	What for? MIRIAM To have my baby and be with you.
M	GUY	Why me? It's not my baby.
F	MIRIAM	But people don't know that, Guy, do they? It would make a pretty story, wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father.
M	GUY	You black conniving little liar!
F	MIRIAM	Keep your voice down.
M	GUY	What happened? Did he run out on you?
F	MIRIAM	No man runs out on me. Not even you.
M	GUY	You're a liar and a cheat, Miriam. You've wanted to get rid of me long enough and now I'll go you one better -- I never want to see or hear of you again.
F	MIRIAM	I could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, Guy. Think it over. Who would believe you?
M	GUY	...That's what should happen to people like you. And if I...
M	HARGREAVES	Break it up, folks. This isn't the place for a family quarrel.
M	GUY	Sorry. I'm leaving.
F	MIRIAM	You heard what I said, Guy Haines. You can't throw me away like an old shoe. I'm coming to Washington to have my baby. Tell that to the senate! comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone
M	GUY	Long distance. I want Washington, D. C. The number is Republic 0800. Person to person. Miss Anne Burton.
M	GUY	Right.
M	GUY	Anne, -- Anne darling. Yes, I'm in Metcalf -- No, everything didn't go smoothly. She doesn't want a divorce, not now....
F	ANNE	Another man's child! But she can't do that to you, Guy -- it's unbelievable -- it's, it's evil! Yes, I know how you must feel. But you sound so savage.
M	GUY	Sure I sound savage. I feel savage. I'd like to break her neck! I said I'd like to break her foul, poisonous, useless little neck! What's that?

M	MRS. ANTHONY	Since you insisted on a manicure, dear, I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet. You're so restless lately.
M	BRUNO	I like them to look just right.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	Did I file them too short?
M	BRUNO	No, Ma. They look fine. Thanks.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	Then what's the matter?
M	BRUNO	I'm all right, Ma. Don't worry about me.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	You look so Pale, dear. Are you out of vitamins?
M	BRUNO	I bought a bottle of them yesterday. A whole fifth.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	But you have that 'look'. I can always tell. You haven't got into any more mischief, Bruno?
M	MRS. ANTHONY	I do hope you've forgotten about that silly little plan of yours?
M	BRUNO	Which one? MRS. ANTHONY About blowing up the White House?
M	BRUNO	I was only kidding, Ma. Besides, what would the president say?
M	MRS. ANTHONY	You're a naughty boy, Bruno. But you can always make me laugh. Now get shaved, dear, before your father gets home.
M	BRUNO	I'm sick and tired of bowing and scraping to the king.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	Now, now, Let's not lose control. Come see my painting, dear -- I do wish you'd take up painting. It's such a soothing pastime.
M	BRUNO	You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old boy, all right. That's father! MRS. ANTHONY It is? I was trying to paint Saint Francis.
M	BUTLER	They are ready with your call to Southampton, Sir.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	How nice that you're early, Charles. I'll tell cook....
M	MR. ANTHONY	Just a minute, Eunice. Bruno! Come here! I want to talk to you and your mother.
M	BRUNO	Sorry father. Long distance. Hello... MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE Now it's hit and run driving! And you knew about it all the time!
M	BRUNO	Guy? Bruno, Bruno Anthony.
M	MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE	You're going to protect him once too often. After all we do have a responsibility to society.
M	BRUNO	I just wanted to ask how you made out with Miriam.
M	GUY	What? Metcalf? Who'd you say you were?
M	BRUNO	Bruno, Guy. Bruno Anthony. Don't you remember? On the train.
M	MRS. ANTHONY	I never permit it! BRUNO Are you getting your divorce?
M	MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE	I tell you he should be sent somewhere for treatment before it's too late.
M	BRUNO	So she double-crossed you! Are you going to see her again?
M	MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE	I tell you, Eunice, I'm going to have that boy put away if it's the last thing I do!
M	WOMAN	Hello Mrs. Joyce. Warm, ain't it?
F	MRS. JOYCE	That it is.
M	WOMAN	I've been reading where your son-in- law's been coming right along at tennis.
F	MRS. JOYCE	We don't have any interest in tennis any more. Don't you stay out too late, Miriam.
F	MIRIAM	Goodnight, Mother. See you later.

M	BLIND MAN	Thanks.
M	COLLINS	There was a man, now please take note. There was a man who had a goat. He loved that goat, Indeed he did. He loved that goat, just like a kid. What is your opinion?
M	GUY	You'll never make the Metropolitan.
M	COLLINS	Name's Collins. On sabbatical - Delaware Tech. Glad to meet you. I jus' gave a speech in New York. On integration. In the differential calculus a function is given and its differential is obtained. Understand?

M	SHOT	frowning in puzzlement as he looks at Bruno.
M	BRUNO	Hello, Guy.
M	GUY	What are you doing here? At this time of night?
M	BRUNO	You don't seem very pleased to see me, Guy.
M	BRUNO	I brought you a little present.
M	GUY	What do you mean?
M	GUY	What's this all about?
M	BRUNO	Recognize them?
M	BRUNO	It was very quick, Guy. She wasn't hurt in any way. It was all over in no time. GUY
M	BRUNO'S VOICE	I know you'd be surprised. Nothing for us to worry about. Nobody saw me, only Miriam.
M	BRUNO	I was very careful. Even when I dropped your lighter there, I went right back to it up. If It'd been found, it would have ruined our whole scheme, wouldn't it?
M	GUY	Are you trying to tell me you've -- Why, you maniac!
M	BRUNO	But, Guy, you wanted it! We planned it on the train together, remember?
M	BRUNO	Where are you going?
M	GUY	Where do you think I'm going? I'm going to call the police, of course.
M	BRUNO	But you can't, Guy. We'd both be arrested for murder.
M	GUY	We'd both be arrested for murder?
M	BRUNO	You're is much in it as I am. We planned it together. Criss-cross. I do your murder --
M	GUY	You crazy fool! You think you can get away with that?
M	BRUNO	Oh, come now, Guy. Why should I go to Metcalf and kill a total stranger, unless it was part of the plan and you were in on it? You're the one that benefits, Guy. You're a free man. I didn't even know the girl.
M	GUY	Let me go, Bruno. I had nothing to do with this and the police will believe me.
M	BRUNO	If you go to the police now, you'll just be turning yourself in as in accessory. You see, you have the motive. BRUNO What is it?
M	GUY	My telephone.
M	BRUNO	Someone has some news for you, Guy.
M	BRUNO	Tell them you know about it already, Guy.
M	GUY	You've got me acting, like a criminal, you crazy fool!
M	BRUNO	Don't you call me that.
M	BRUNO	You must be tired, Guy. I know I am. I've sure had a strenuous evening.
M	BRUNO	Now look, Guy, about my father. I have the plans made. Two plans. A plan of the grounds and a plan of the house. I have in old Luger I bought at a pawn shop in San Francisco. My father --
M	BRUNO	Wait a minute, Guy. To have to talk. We have to arrange things.
M	GUY	Get away before I give you what you gave Miriam.
M	BRUNO	You're not yourself, Guy. You're tired. When you think things over, you'll see I'm right. Tomorrow --
M	GUY	I don't know you. I never saw you before. I never want to see you again.
M	BRUNO	But we have to --
M	GUY	Yes? Yes, Anne. I'm sorry, darling. I just got in. Of course I'm all right. But you sound upset. Is anything wrong? All right. I'll come over. Right away.
M	GUY	Anne darling, you're trembling.
F	ANNE	Guy -- I wonder if you know how much I love you.
M	GUY	Brazen woman. I'm the one to say that.
F	ANNE	But I wanted you to know, before... Before we go into the living room.
M	GUY	Good evening, sir. Hello, Babs.
F	BARBARA	Something awful has happened, Guy.
M	SENATOR	Sit down, Barbara.
M	SENATOR	There seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news. I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to tell you. It concerns your wife. She's been murdered.
F	BARBARA	The police have been using everything but radar to locate you.
M	SENATOR	You're to call Headquarters at Metcalf.
M	GUY	Miriam...murdered.
F	ANNE	She was...strangled.
M	SENATOR	It happened on an island in an amusement park. It was sort of a lovers lane, I believe. A rather sordid atmosphere.
F	BARBARA	Miriam went there with two boys. They were the ones who found her. So they're not suspects. But you probably will be.
M	SENATOR	Young lady, we can't overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps. But I forbid you to drag it into the living room!
F	BARBARA	Let's not fool ourselves. The police will say Guy wanted Miriam out of the way so he could marry Anne. In a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband, and Guy had every motive.
M	SENATOR	Motive?
M	GUY	She's right. Whichever way you look at it...I'm in a spot.
M	SENATOR	Oh come now, my boy. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
F	BARBARA	If he hasn't an alibi for nine-thirty tonight he has plenty to worry about.
F	ANNE	You can tell them where you were, can't you, Guy?
M	GUY	At nine-thirty I was on the train from New York to Washington.
M	SENATOR	There you are. BARBARA Who saw you? Did you speak to anyone? You'll need a Witness, you know.
M	GUY	Yes, I spoke to someone.
M	SENATOR	Anyone you know?
M	GUY	No. His name was Collins. He is a professor.
M	SENATOR	Harvard.
M	GUY	University of Virginia.
F	ANNE	Then everything's's all right.
F	BARBARA	Not quite. Detectives play a game called Motive, Motive, Who'd got the Motive.
F	ANNE	I'm sick of hearing that word!
F	BARBARA	He'll still have to answer questions. SENATOR Routine. Pure routine.
M	GUY	I'm afraid there'll be a lot of reporters at your front door in the morning.
F	BARBARA	Daddy doesn't mind a little scandal. He's a senator.
F	ANNE	It can't be helped, darling. It is not your fault. It's not as though anyone can say you had something to do with it.
M	GUY	Someone might say it...I'd do anything to keep you all out of this mess.
M	SENATOR	Profit by my experience, Guy. Never lose any sleep over accusations. Unless they can be proved, of course. We'll help all we can. Dreadful business, dreadful. That poor unfortunate girl.
F	BARBARA	She was a tramp.
M	SENATOR	She was a human being. let me remind you that even the most unworthy of us has the right to life and the pursuit of happiness.
F	BARBARA	From what I hear, she pursued it in all directions.
M	SENATOR	Barbara! ANNE Father, it's getting terribly late, and Guy looks so tired...
M	SENATOR	Of course, of course. Back to bed, Barbara.
F	BARBARA	Well, you two. Nothing stands in your way now. You can be married right away. Think of it -- you're free! TWO ANNE AND GUY TO SCENE
M	SENATOR	One doesn't always have to say what one thinks!
F	BARBARA	Father, I'm not a politician.
M	SENATOR	You won't forget that call, Guy? Captain Turley.
M	GUY	Yes sir. Goodnight.
F	BARBARA	I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he'd kill for you.
F	ANNE	I told myself over and over I was being silly, but there was one horrible moment tonight when the news came through. I kept remembering what you shouted telephone from Metcalf.
M	GUY	That I could strang...
F	ANNE	Don't even say it. Forget you ever said it. Even more terrifying than the murder itself, Guy, was the awful thought that if you had anything to do with it we'd be separated, -perhaps forever. I'd never see you again. I couldn't bear it. GUY Captain Turley's office?
M	GUY	Captain Turley is expecting me. Guy Haines.
M	SERGEANT	Just a moment, Mr. Haines.
F	MRS. JOYCE	You'll pay for this!
M	SERGEANT'S VOICE	Will you come in, please, Mr. Haines?
M	CAPTAIN TURLEY	Good of you to be so prompt, Mr. Haines. This is Lieutenant Campbell. Won't you sit down?
M	GUY	Thank you, sir.
M	CAPTAIN TURLEY	I know you're a busy man, so we won't detain you any longer than necessary...Now you already been good enough to tell us where you were last evening, and we've managed to locate the gentleman you spoke with on the train.
M	GUY	Yes. I saw him outside.
M	CAMPBELL	Will you come in please, professor?
M	TURLEY	Professor Collins, this is Mr. Haines. He was with you on the train last night.
M	COLLINS	I'm terribly sorry, but I really don't remember meeting this gentleman.
M	PROFESSOR COLLINS	turns from the captain to Guy.
M	COLLINS	Unfortunately, I remember very little about the journey from New York...You see, there had been a little celebration --
M	GUY	But we were sitting opposite each other in the observation car! You were singing a song about a goat --
M	COLLINS	A goat?
M	GUY	And calculus. You were going over a speech you'd made.
M	COLLINS	I was? I'm sorry, Mr. Halnes. I certainly must have celebrated! I can't remember you at all.
M	GUY	Captain, is it so important whether or not Professor Collins remember me? Surely, the important thing is that I've been able to name a man who was on the train with me. You've been able to find him. Isn't that proof of where I was at nine-thirty last night? asks this question with a look of near triumph that he
F	ANNE	Hello, darling. Have you had your dinner?
M	GUY	On the train.
F	ANNE	You weren't in Metcalf all this time? We expected you hours ago.
F	BARBARA	I didn't. They sometimes throw a suspect in the can and keep him there all night.
M	SENATOR	Sit down, Guy. Sit down. Give him some coffee, Anne. You had no trouble with the police of course, once they verified your alibi?
M	GUY	When an alibi is full of bourbon, sir, it can't stand up.
F	BARBARA	You mean the professor was boiled?
M	GUY	Completely. He didn't remember me.
F	ANNE	But, you knew he was on the train! Wasn't that enough to prove you were on it, too?
M	GUY	Apparently not at the right time. They suggested I could have caught the train at Baltimore after Miriam was murdered. They had it all worked out -- in their timetables.
F	ANNE	That's ridiculous. They're acting as if you were guilty.
F	BARBARA	Everything will be all right, Anne. The police were just being thorough -- Weren't they, daddy?
M	SENATOR	I certainly hope so. What is your next step?
M	GUY	Whatever it is, the police will know it. They gave me a present -- come take a look.
M	GUY	My guardian angel.
F	BARBARA	You're being tailed!
M	GUY	That's Leslie Hennessy. He works sixteen hours a day. Somebody else takes over for the next eight. As a matter of fact, Hennessy's a very nice fellow.
F	BARBARA	Shouldn't we ask him in for Coffee -- or something?
M	SENATOR	I'll have him called off immediately of course.
M	GUY	I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes. Even to the Senate.
M	SENATOR	Is he likely to -- picket my office?
M	GUY	Very likely.
M	SENATOR	I would suggest, Guy, for your own peace of mind, of course, that you work here at the house for a few days. It would be less embarrassing for you.
M	GUY	Then what about practicing? Perhaps I'd better forget Forest Hills?
M	SENATOR	My dear boy, wouldn't it look rather -- awkward -- if you suddenly canceled all your plans.
F	ANNE	He's right, Guy. You mustn't do anything that would look suspicious. You've got to carry on as though nothing has happened.
F	BARBARA	Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.
M	RANDALL	A call for you, Mr. Haines. They say it is urgent.
M	GUY	Hello --
M	BRUNO	Hello, Guy. I tried your apartment, but -- Why, Guy, this is Bruno!
M	GUY	Must be some mistake. It wasn't for me.
M	GUY	Well, I suppose I was pretty lucky to be seeded fifth, really.
M	HENNESSY	I've never seen the Forest Hillss tournament before. I'm looking forward to it.
M	GUY	Do you mean we'll be going there together, Hennessy?
M	HENNESSY	Oh, don't worry. This thing will be cleared up by that time. Ever thought of turning professional, Guy?
M	GUY	I won't have to do that. When I'm through with tennis. I'll be going into politics, I hope.
M	HENNESSY	Politics! It's a good thing for you I don't report that to the chief.
M	HENNESSY'S VOICE	If he knew you were getting into that rat-race --
M	HENNESSY	-- He'd put ten men on your trail. He says --

F	ANNE	I like.
M	GUY	I was beginning to feel like a goldfish.
F	ANNE	So was I. When we build our house, darling, we won't even have glass windows. No doorbells, no newspapers, no telephone --
M	GUY	No Hennessy.
F	ANNE	How long can it go on?
M	GUY	I don't know. I suppose until they find out who did it.
F	ANNE	We'll be happier then, won't we?
M	GUY	I suppose so.
M	BRUNO	Guy!
M	GUY	Will you stop pestering me!
M	BRUNO	But Guy, you haven't called me. My father's leaving for Florida the end of this week --
M	GUY	You crazy fool! There's a detective outside. He'll see us together!
M	BRUNO	Oh, they can't have anything on you. Isn't that Anne Burton? Slight improvement over Miriam -- eh, Guy?
M	GUY	Stay away from me, I tell you!
F	ANNE	Who was it, Guy?
M	GUY	I never saw him before. Just some tennis fan.
M	SECRETARY	Here's a special delivery, Mr. Haines. It's marked personal.
F	BARBARA	Are you getting in any practice today, Guy?
M	GUY	of paper and glances Yes, if I can get a court at the club.
M	SECRETARY'S VOICE	Barbara, who are you waving at?
M	BARBARA'S VOICE	Mr. Hennessy. I think it is a shame Daddy won't let us have him in the house to sit down. Have you met him yet, Louise?
M	SECRETARY'S VOICE	No.
M	BARBARA'S VOICE	He is awfully cute.
M	SECRETARY	Is anything wrong, Mr. Haines?
M	GUY	voice breaks his reverie. He answers her with a forced
M	GUY	No, thank you, Louise. COURT AT WASHINGTON COUNTRY CLUB SHOT
M	FIRST WOMAN	I didn't think he'd show up after what happened.
M	SECOND WOMAN	And miss all the publicity?
M	GUY	looks across at the watching crowd.
M	PLAYER'S VOICE	Ready, Guy?
F	ANNE	Guy, darling -- this is Mr. Antony -- a friend of Monsieur and Madame Darville... Guy Haines.
M	BRUNO	I've been a fan of yours for a long time, Mr. Haines. In fact, I follow everything you do.
M	MME. DARVILLE	Mr. Antony has been telling us such charming stories... Very funny.
M	BARBARA'S VOICE	Guy!
F	BARBARA	I've just been talking to your shadow. Guy, did you know Mr. Hennessy helped crack that axe murder I was reading about? You know, the one where the body was cut up and hidden in the butcher shop? He was locked in the ice box with the left leg for six hours!
M	GUY	He pulls those yarns right out of his hat, Babs.
F	BARBARA	Who's the nice looking Frenchman with the Darvilles?
M	GUY	He's not French. His name's Antony.
F	BARBARA	How do you do, Madame Darville. Monsieur.
M	BARBARA'S VOICE	How are you? FRENCH COUPLES' VOICES Delightful to see you. How sweet you look, Miss Barbara.
F	BARBARA	I hope you aren't forgetting our little party on Thursday, Madame.
M	MME. DARVILLE	We are planning on it?
M	M. DARVILLE	But of course.
F	ANNE	This is my sister Barbara. Barbara, this is Mr. Antony.
M	IN	
M	Just two more days left. We must	get together for final details.
M	GUY	Hiya, Hennessy. Won't keep you out late tonight. With Forest Hills coming up tomorrow, I've got to get some sleep.
M	HENNESSY	That's too bad. Hammond takes over in a couple of hours. I'd like to see him earn his salary.
M	GUY	Doesn't that bloodhound over relax? He sticks so close he's beginning to grow on me -- like a fungus.
M	HENNESSY	He thinks you're a very suspicious character. He doesn't trust anybody! Not even himself.
M	GUY	Come on. Don't forget your sleeping bag.
M	HENNESSY	Yeah, If I have to wait too long on the sidewalk my feet get cold. And if I sit too long on those stone steps, my --
M	GUY	Don't worry. Since you told Barbara Burton about the icebox, you're her favorite charity. She'll send the butler out with something to defrost you.

M	BRUNO	Good evening, Miss Burton.
F	ANNE	This is Mr. Antony, father.
M	SENATOR	How do you do, sir.
M	BRUNO	I'd like to talk to you sometime, Senator, about my idea of harnessing the life force. It will make atomic power look like the horse and buggy. I'm already developing my faculty for seeing millions of miles. And, Senator, can you imagine being able to smell a flower on the planet of Mars? I'd like to lunch with you some day soon and tell you more about it.
M	DOWAGER	So nice to see you, my dear Senator.
M	SENATOR	Ah yes, indeed -- I beg your pardon?
M	SENATOR	I don't remember inviting that young man. Who is he? ANNE A friend of the Darvilles.
M	SENATOR	He has an unusual personality. Provocative. BARBARA
M	BRUNO	But tell me, Judge, after you've sentenced a man to the chair, isn't it difficult to go and eat your dinner after that?
M	JUDGE	Young man, when a murderer is caught, he must be tried. When he is convicted, he must be sentenced. When he is sentenced to death, he must be executed.
M	BRUNO	Quite impersonal, isn't it, sir?
M	JUDGE	So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen every day.
M	BRUNO	So few murderers are caught.
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very interested in the subject of murder.
M	BRUNO	No more than anyone else. No more than you, for instance.
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Me? I'm not interested in murder.
M	BRUNO	Oh, come now, everyone's interested in that. Everyone would like to put someone out of the way. Now surely, Madame, you're not going to tell me that there hasn't been a time when you wanted to dispose of someone. Your husband, for instance.
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Good heavens, no!
M	BRUNO	Ah ah! Are you sure? Do you mean to tell me there wasn't a tiny moment - when you'd been made really angry? And what did you say?
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Well...
M	BRUNO	There you are, you see! There you are! All right, now you're going -- to do a murder. How are you going to do it? This is the fascinating part -- how are you going to do it...I didn't get your name?
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Mrs. Cunningham.
M	BRUNO	Mrs. Cunningham, how are you going to do it?
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Well, I suppose I'll have to get a gun from somewhere.
M	BRUNO	Tssk, tssk. Oh no, Mrs. Cunningham. Bang, bang, all over the place. Blood everywhere?
F	MRS. ANDERSON	What about a little poison?
M	BRUNO	Ah! That's better, that's better. Mrs.....?
F	MRS. ANDERSON	Anderson. BRUNO That's better, Mrs. Anderson. But Mrs. Cunningham is in a dreadful hurry. Poison could take...let's see...ten to twelve weeks, if poor Mr. Cunningham is to die from natural causes.
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	I have a wonderful Idea! I can take him out in the car and when I get to a lonely spot, knock him on the head with a hammer, pour gasoline over him and over the car and start the whole thing ablaze.
M	BRUNO	And then have to walk all that way home?
M	BRUNO	No, I have the best way, and the best tools. Simple, silent, and quick. The silent part being the most important. Let me show you what I mean. Cunningham's throat, You don't mind if I borrow your neck for a moment do you?
M	MRS. CUNNINGHAM	Well, it's not for long.
M	BRUNO	Oh! no. Now, when I nod my head, just see if you can cry out, and I bet you can't. Now with my two thumbs...you see that's where I'll be able to prevent any sound coming from you. Now, just wait for the nod of my head.

M	GUY	Bring him this way. ANNE Bring her upstairs.
M	SENATOR	I thought he was a bit weird when he arrived. Who is he?
M	GUY	I hardly know him, sir.
M	SENATOR	Get him out of here as soon as you decently can -- will you. This is a nice item for the gossips. First thing you know, they'll be talking about orgies. I'd better get back...
M	GUY	Yes, sir.
M	BRUNO	What happened? I was on a merry-go- round somewhere. It made me dizzy.
M	GUY	You're a mad, crazy maniac, and you ought to be locked-up! Now will you get out of here and let me alone?
M	BRUNO	But, Guy --
M	BRUNO	You shouldn't have done that, Guy.
M	GUY	Come on -- pull yourself together. Do your tie up.
M	GUY	Here -- let me.
M	GUY	Have you got a car here?
M	BRUNO	Driver's outside. or two of the guests turn their heads as Guy takes Bruno
F	ANNE	What's the matter, Barbara? Did you see it happen? Did you see it -- all?
F	BARBARA	He looked at me! His hands were on her throat, but, he was strangling me! ANNE
F	ANNE	How do you mean?
F	BARBARA	He was looking at her first. Then he looked over at me. He went into a sort of trance He looked horrible! He thought he was murdering me.
F	BARBARA	Anne, why me? Why me? What did I have to do with it?
F	ANNE	Do you know where Guy is?
F	BARBARA	He went out with that man!
F	ANNE	calls out urgently:
F	ANNE	Guy! SHOT
F	ANNE	You didn't meet him for the first time the other day, did you, Guy?
M	GUY	You mean when you introduced us at the club?
F	ANNE	Yes. Did you notice how he stared at Barbara that day?
M	GUY	Well, I didn't -- particularly --
F	ANNE	He stared at her again tonight -- while his hands were around Mrs. Cunningham's throat.
F	ANNE	What did Miriam look like, Guy.
M	GUY	Well, why do you ask me? You've seen her pictures in the paper.
F	ANNE	Go on, I want you to tell me.
M	GUY	Well, she was dark, not too tall, rather pretty --
F	ANNE	What else?
M	GUY	What else is there?
F	ANNE	She wore glasses, didn't she?
M	GUY	Yes.
F	ANNE	She looked a lot like Barbara, didn't she?
F	ANNE	How did you get him to do it, Guy.
M	GUY	I get him to do it?
F	ANNE	He killed Miriam, didn't he? Tell me, Guy!
M	GUY	Yes. He's a maniac. I met him on the train going to Metcalf. He had a crazy scheme about exchanging murders. I do his murder and he do mine.
F	ANNE	What do you mean -- your murder, Guy?
M	GUY	Well, he'd read about me in the paper. He knew about Miriam -- and about you. He suggested that if he got rid of Miriam for me, I should kill his father.
F	ANNE	You must have realized he was talking a lot of nonsense!
M	GUY	Of course! I didn't give it another thought. And now a lunatic wants me to kill his father.
F	ANNE	It's too fantastic!
M	GUY	Yes, isn't it?
F	ANNE	You mean you've known about Miriam all this time?
M	GUY	Since the first night. He gave me her glasses.
F	ANNE	Why didn't you call the police?
M	GUY	And have them say what you did -- "Mr. Haines, how did you get him to do it?" And Bruno would say we'd planed it together.
F	ANNE	Oh, Guy -- what can we do?
M	GUY	I don't know, Anne...I don't know.
F	ANNE	Guy, hadn't we better go inside? Your friend Hennessy's watching us.
M	GUY	You see, Anne, that's why I didn't want you to know anything about this. I wanted to protect all of you -- your father, Barbara. And now that you know, you're acting guilty, too.
F	ANNE	Oh, if we could only talk to father or someone about it.
M	GUY	No, that's no good, Anne. I mustn't drag anyone else into this mess. Come on. Let's go in.
M	HENNESSY	Hello, Hammond.
M	HAMMOND	You look worried. What's the matter?
M	HENNESSY	You'd better keep on your toes. Something funny's going on.
M	GUY	Bruno? Yes, yes, it's Guy...I've decided to do what you want. I'll make that little visit to father.... Tonight. Yes, I want to get this thing over with, can you leave the house again, Bruno? You'd better stay out till daylight.
M	SHOT	leaves the gates ajar and then, taking the plan of Bruno's
M	GUY	Mr. Antony!
M	GUY	Mr. Antony! Don't be alarmed -- but I must talk to you about your son. About Bruno. Mr. Antony! BRUNO Yes, Mr. Haines?
M	BRUNO	My father isn't home tonight, Mr. Haines. I was about to tell you that over the phone. But you came to such a sudden decision. I wondered why.
M	GUY	Since you sent me a key to your house, I decided to use it -- to make a little social call on your father. I thought he'd be Interested to know he his a lunatic son.
M	BRUNO	Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in assuming that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement?
M	GUY	No intention whatsoever. I never had.
M	BRUNO	I see. You won't have any further use for the key, then, Mr. Haines. Thank you very such.
M	GUY	Or this.
M	GUY	Look, Bruno. You're terribly sick. I don't know whether it's possible for you to realize it or not. I don't know much about these things, Bruno. But why don't you go someplace where you can get some treatment? Not only for your own sake, Bruno, but you can't go on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet.
M	BRUNO	I don't like to be doublecrossed.
M	BRUNO (CONT'D)	I have a murder on my conscience, but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines -- it's yours. And as you're the one to profit, I think you should be the one to pay for it.
M	GUY	Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno. We sees to have nothing further to discuss. goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it
M	BRUNO	Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb mother. I'm a very clever follow. I'll think of something better than that. Much better.
M	HAMMOND	He came back at three twenty-five. I didn't even know he'd given me the slip until his 'phone kept ringing for about half an hour. Nobody sleeps that sound. So I got the janitor to let me in. No Haines.
M	HENNESSY	Wonder where he went?
M	HAMMOND	We'll probably hear of another dame murdered.
M	HENNESSY	Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf. I should think this calls for more questioning of Mr. Haines.
M	HAMMOND	Questioning? Nuts! Let's take him in.
M	HENNESSY	My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times do I have to tell you that we have nothing conclusive on Haines? There's no evidence that he was ever at the scene of the crime. Can't you get that into your thick head? Now stay put till I get back.
M	IN	
F	MRS. ANTONY	Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I know Bruno's been in some very awkward scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous as a murder. ANNE But, Mrs. Antony, you've got to make him do something about this. Don't you see that just one word from him would extricate Guy from this dreadful situation?
F	MRS. ANTONY	Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this thing must be some practical joke. You know, Bruno sometimes goes too far. Of course I shouldn't be saying this to an outsider, but sometimes he's terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades.
F	ANNE	But don't you understand, Mrs. Antony -- your son is responsible for a woman's death.
F	MRS. ANTONY	Did Bruno tell you this?
F	ANNE	Of course not, Mrs. Antony.
F	MRS. ANTONY	Well, there you are.
M	MRS. ANTONY (CONT'D)	Well, Miss Burton, it was very nice of you to call. You must excuse me now. I must get back to my painting. Do you care for painting, Miss Burton? I find it so soothing. You must come again sometime. BRUNO'S VOICE Oh, Miss Burton!
M	BRUNO	I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful, was she? You know she hasn't been well for a long time. She's a little -- how shall I say -- confused. Poor mother.
M	BRUNO	You know, I'm very upset with Guy. He shouldn't have sent you on an errand like this.
F	ANNE	Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony.
M	BRUNO	He's been leading you up the garden path, I'm afraid. He must be very desperate to try to involve me. I've been protecting him ever since we had that conversation on the train and he told me how he hated his wife.
M	BRUNO	Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he tried to get me to go back to the island one night after dark and pick up his lighter so the police wouldn't find it? He dropped it there, you know, when -- well, that night.
M	BRUNO	The whole thing's been worrying me so much. But of course I couldn't do it, Miss Burton. It would have been too risky. And besides, it would have made me an accessory.
M	BRUNO	Miss Burton, I know how you feel.
M	BRUNO	Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I have an urgent appointment. I must go up and change. Now, I really must go...if you'll excuse me...
F	ANNE	...And he said that if the police found your lighter there, that's all they'd need -- something to prove you were at the scene of the murder.
M	GUY	That big lie about my wanting him to get it back means he's going to put my lighter on that island!
F	ANNE	Guy, you'll have to get there before he does. You won't have time to play, You'd better tell them.
M	GUY	Darling, if that loudspeaker announces that I'm not going to play, Hennessy bound to be suspicious He'd keep me from ever getting near Metcalf.
F	ANNE	Then I'll go.
M	GUY	No, darling. hers and speaks firmly, with concern for her safety as You stay right here and help me give Hennessy the slip after the match.
F	ANNE	But, Guy, that'll be too late!
M	GUY	Didn't Bruno say that I wanted him together there one night after dark?
F	ANNE	Yes.
M	GUY	Well, that's what's in his mind now. He's not going to expose himself in broad daylight, If I can finish off this match in three sets, I'll still get there in time.
M	REYNOLDS	We're on in a few minutes, Guy. How are you, Miss Morton.
M	GUY	Okay, Tim. Be right with you.
M	HAMMOND	Well, if Turley said to pick him up for questioning, let's pick him up!
M	HENNESSY	Let him have his game first, Hammond.
M	HAMMOND	This is the first time I ever waited for a murder suspect to play tennis before I pulled him in. When the boys it headquarters heir about this they'll send me orchids. and Anne come into the scene just as the players from
M	HENNESSY	Good luck, Guy.
M	GUY	You got it straight? Just make sure Barbara has everything ready as soon as the third set starts.
M	ANNOUNCER	--It looks like an interesting match with Haines constantly charging the net -- not like Haines at all -- to press so early in the game...

M	OFFICIAL	Well, at least there'd be a trip to Australia, if you made it.
M	GUY	We'll know more about that by the end of the week...
M	OFFICIAL	They're close to the finish, Guy
M	GUY	Be right there. I was afraid you wouldn't get here. Wish me luck, darling.
F	ANNE	Guy, listen to me, If I sound all mixed up I can't help it. I -- I'm scared.
M	GUY	What about?
F	ANNE	That's just it. I don't know. It's Bruno. I talked to him, Guy --
F	ANNE	He acted peculiar -- as if he could put the murder right in your lap, and not involve himself at all.
M	GUY	He'd drag himself into it, -- and Bruno loves Bruno. I'm all right so long as he thinks I have an alibi for that night. He knows?
M	GUY	Then he'll think of something. He said he would.
F	ANNE	Guy, has he anything that the police could trace to you -- Any little thing.
M	GUY	My cigarette lighter. He said once he could have left it on the islands as evidence But he wouldn't do that. Not in broad day light.
F	ANNE	But he's going somewhere, Guy. He told his mother --
M	GUY	Metcalf -- did he say Metcalf?
F	ANNE	No, -- I don't think so. Oh, why can't I remember -- he said such crazy things!
M	GUY	Try to think, Anne!
M	VOICE	Guy Haines! -- Reynolds!
F	ANNE	Something about the moon -- he said he had an appointment with the moon.
M	GUY	That's no help. But I can't take any chances. I've got to get that lighter -- somehow.
M	REYNOLDS	Okay, Guy. We're on.
M	GUY	I'll have to default.
F	ANNE	And have Hennessy and that other one right at your heels?
M	HAMMOND	First time I ever waited for a killer to play tennis before I nabbed him!
M	HAMMOND (CONT'D)	When the boys at headquarters hear about this they'll send me an orchid!
M	HENNESSY	We got our orders. We take him in -- after the match.
M	HENNESSY	Good luck, Guy! gives him a thank-you nod. Hammond rolls his eyes in

M	TURLEY	Is this your lighter, Haines?
M	TURLEY	Well, you were right. I'd better keep this for the time being. We can clear the whole thing out the morning. How about staying in town over night, Haines? I imagine you have a lot to tell me. Nine o'clock, all right?
M	GUY	Okay, Mr. Turley. Thanks.
M	GUY	Can you tell me where there's a telephone?
M	BOATMAN	There's one up near the entrance. Who was he, Bud?
M	GUY	Bruno. Bruno Antony. compassionately, remembering what Bruno had said of A very clever fellow.
F	ANNE	Hello... Yes, operator, yes! Guy?
M	ANNE (CONT'D)	heartfelt relief. Yes, darling, yes. Of course I'll be there...Goodbye.
F	ANNE	Guy'll be back tomorrow. He wants me to take him some things.
F	ANNE	He says he looks silly in his tennis clothes.
M	SENATOR	I presume from all those tears that you have had good news.
M	CLERIC	I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines?
M	GUY	Yes.
