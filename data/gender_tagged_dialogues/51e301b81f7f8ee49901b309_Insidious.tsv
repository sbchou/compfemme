M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WOMAN	Let me in.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Mom? What are you doing up, kiddo?
M	DALTON	I don't like my room.
F	RENAI	You'll get used to it. It's only your first night.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Argh, I'm going to eat you.
M	DALTON	What are you looking at?
F	RENAI	Just some photos.
M	DALTON	What photos?
F	RENAI	Do you know who that is?
M	DALTON	No.
F	RENAI	That's me.
M	DALTON	It doesn't look like you.
F	RENAI	I know. I'm so happy there. But it's me. When I was your age. I was a kid once too, you know.
M	DALTON	No, you weren't.
F	RENAI	Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't remember being this person at all. I hope she smiled like that all the time, whoever she was.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	This is a terrible thing to admit, Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of you. That you're so young. That you haven't made any of your decisions yet.
M	DALTON	I don't wanna grow old.
F	RENAI	Well, it starts happening to us from the moment we're born.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Every time that clock ticks, we all get a little bit older.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	That's your grandpa. You wouldn't remember him.
M	DALTON	He smells like smoke.
F	RENAI	Yeah...good memory. He did smoke that god awful pipe, didn't he?
M	DALTON	Show me a picture of dad when he was a little kid.
F	RENAI	I don't even know if we have any. He's hopeless with keeping photos.
M	DALTON	Show me a picture of me when I was a little kid.
F	RENAI	Your pictures are all in the computer. Nobody keeps photo albums like this anymore, they're ancient relics. They should. I like being able to touch something, instead of it floating around in cyber world. If the laptop breaks, your whole existence is erased.
M	DALTON	What was I like when I was a little kid?
F	RENAI	You are a little kid.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	If only you knew what I know.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	You certainly didn't cry as much as your little sister does. Come on.
F	RENAI	Billing department.
M	FOSTER	I need a bowl, mom.
F	RENAI	Billing department.
M	FOSTER	It's too small.
F	RENAI	Make it work. Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent.
M	JOSH	Every time I think I've pulled you out...you grow back in.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Ouch!
F	RENAI	Well, I'd like to keep the old number if I could. You really need to learn how to do this, honey.
M	JOSH	Don't eat on the floor, buddy.
F	RENAI	Okay, well, please let me know by the end of today, I have to give the number out. Thank you.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Foster, get up. Now.
M	JOSH	How come you were up so early? Was Cali crying?
F	RENAI	You woke me up.
M	JOSH	What do you mean?
F	RENAI	You were snoring.
M	JOSH	No I wasn't.
F	RENAI	Yes you were.
M	JOSH	I don't snore.
F	RENAI	Yes you do.
M	JOSH	My father snored. I do not snore.
F	RENAI	How would you know what you do? You're asleep.
M	DALTON	Yes! I made it to the last level! Invisiworld!
M	JOSH	Good one, champ. I don't snore, do I?
F	RENAI	Where are my bleeping pills?
M	JOSH	What the heck is this? Wax?!
F	RENAI	Yes.
M	JOSH	Let me get this straight - we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit?
F	RENAI	Yes.
M	JOSH	That is dangerous. It could kill one of our kids.
F	RENAI	Where are my pills, Josh?
M	JOSH	Probably where you left them, Renai.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	See.
F	RENAI	That's not where I left them.
M	DALTON	Mom, I need my lunch.
F	RENAI	Oh, geez. Look, just...take last night's dinner.
M	DALTON	Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food.
F	RENAI	It's all we have. Just for today, honey.
M	JOSH	Check it first, Dalton. It's probably made out of Styrofoam.
F	RENAI	And while I've got you, if you're going to look at my books, please don't leave them all over the floor.
M	DALTON	I didn't touch your books.
M	JOSH	I gotta go.
F	RENAI	Are you taking the boys to school?
M	JOSH	No time.
F	RENAI	Well can you pick them up after school?
M	JOSH	Not today.
F	RENAI	But I have stuff I wanted to...
M	FOSTER	Can I have another cup, mom?
M	JOSH	Alanso, please sit down.
M	ALANSO	No entiendo.
M	JOSH	Si√©ntate, por favor.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Come on guys, quieten down.
M	TERI	You better all shut up.
M	THE ONE KID	Just cos you're in love.
M	JOSH	Thank you, Teri. Today we are going to talk about Darwin. It's a city in Australia, but it's also the last name of which famous naturalist?
M	MALE STUDENT # 1	Charles Darwin.
M	JOSH	Correct. Does anybody know what he is famous for?
M	MALE STUDENT # 1	He said that people descended from monkeys.
M	JOSH	Half right. He wrote a seminal book that explained his theories on natural selection, and how the different species on this planet - including humans - evolved.
M	ALANSO	I know I didn't evolve from no monkey. Shit. Everyone laughs.
M	JOSH	Humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys, or more specifically, chimpanzees.
M	ALANSO	Maybe you do, but I was created in the image of my Dios.
M	JOSH	I respect your right to believe that, Alanso. But I want to give you all possible theories. I want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion.
M	ALANSO	The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert.
M	JOSH	How can it be incorrect? It's a theory. A scientific theory.
M	ALANSO	Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We didn't get here cos of no test-tubes.
M	JOSH	Alanso, if you keep talking like that I'm going to ask you to visit the principal.
M	ALANSO	Fine.
F	RENAI	Yeah, I'm looking west, always been looking that way, gonna get it all happening, just can't do it today...
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Yeah, I'm looking west, always been looking that way, I'm gonna be somebody, I just can't be her today-- The basement is large and completely bare. Cleaned out.
M	JOSH	Look at this. Nice job.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Whoa, buddy. Slow down.
F	RENAI	Josh, where's the box of my lamps?
M	JOSH	I don't know. They should be here. We packed them up.
F	RENAI	Yeah, I packed them. They're not here.
M	JOSH	I remember the movers bringing them in and putting them right there.
F	RENAI	Well, they're not here. I would know, I've been unpacking this stuff all day.
F	RENAI	Dalton? Where are you?
F	RENAI	Dalton?
M	JOSH	What happened?
M	DALTON	I fell.
F	RENAI	Dalton, you have to be careful. You shouldn't be coming down here in the dark.
M	JOSH	Where do you hurt the most?
M	DALTON	My knee and my head. I can't stand up.
M	JOSH	You scared us, champ.
M	JOSH	You're lucky you don't need stitches.
F	RENAI	If I catch you falling down the stairs again I'm gonna break your neck.
M	DALTON	That doesn't make sense.
M	DALTON (CONT'D)	You might be a superhero but you're not invincible. Be more careful, bud.
F	RENAI	Sleep tight, honey.
M	JOSH	We've gotta lock that door.
F	RENAI	He's such a boy. He goes off exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep him on one of those child leashes.
M	JOSH	Why bother with a child leash? I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow.
F	RENAI	I'm sorry I was pissy when you got home. I was trying to work on a song today and then Cali woke up and wouldn't stop crying...
M	JOSH	I didn't even notice.
F	RENAI	I feel guilty for wanting my own time.
M	JOSH	It's normal to want your own time.
F	RENAI	Is it? My mother gave up everything for me. I keep waiting for the completely selfless parent gene to kick in, but I'm exactly the same person I was when I was 22, only now I'm married with kids.
M	JOSH	You're a great mother.
F	RENAI	No, I'm not. They like you so much better than me.
M	JOSH	That's not true.
F	RENAI	You're the cool dad who comes home with presents and I'm the one who yells at them all day.
M	JOSH	Now you're being crazy. They love you. At least you get to connect with them. I work so much.
F	RENAI	Believe me, you're their hero. They try to play us off against each other. They're master manipulators. I guess they really are my kids. Is this it, Josh?
M	JOSH	Is this so bad?
F	RENAI	Thank you for letting me take some time off to work on my music again.
M	JOSH	We'll get by. I want you to do it.
F	RENAI	There's a couple of songs...I mean not all of them, but there's a couple of them that I think are really good. And I think, maybe I could do something with them.
M	JOSH	I love all your songs.
F	RENAI	Foster, sit down honey.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go wake up Dalton?
M	JOSH	Time to get up, my man. Come on.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	You're making me look bad here. Outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us. Nothing. He's really out.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Dalton, get up. You've gotta get ready for school.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Dalton...?
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!!
M	DR. SERCARZ	Okay...as of yet, our tests have not drawn any conclusive answers for you. Repeated blood and CSF cultures are normal, making an infective origin highly unlikely. Tests for Lyme disease and repeated polymerase chain reaction are negative. Systemic vasculitis was ruled out. Dalton remains in an areactive coma without focal signs or abnormal brainstem reflexes.
M	DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)	We've looked for bacterial pathogens like Meningoencephalitis, but haven't seen anything.
M	DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)	I wouldn't say we've exhausted every single angle...but we're close. The underlying cause is still unknown.
M	DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)	The good news is that he's breathing without the use of a mechanical apparatus, and there are no lesions or hemorrhages in any of the CT scans.
M	JOSH	So...there's no brain damage or...?
M	DR. SERCARZ	None that we've detected. Technically, he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but there's no brain trauma or infection. His scans are normal. To be honest, I've never seen anything like it.
M	JOSH	That fall he took...I mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard.
M	DR. SERCARZ	We definitely exhausted that possibility, but it was always doubtful. The cut was superficial, there wasn't even a skull fracture.
F	RENAI	He can't just not wake up...there's got to be something...
M	DR. SERCARZ	I'm sorry.
M	JOSH	So what do we do now? Does he stay here?
M	DR. SERCARZ	We'll conduct some further testing, but beyond that...I really don't know. Excuse me for a minute. I have to step out. A nurse will be with you in just a moment.
F	ADELE	Are you having any more trouble with the feeding tube?
F	RENAI	It's okay.
F	ADELE	Alright, well I'll be back soon. I'll bring some new books. You're probably sick of the ones you have.
F	RENAI	Did he respond to any of the tests?
F	ADELE	No...no, he didn't. But we have to give it time. I've seen coma patients with a much longer inactivity time suddenly start making noises.
F	RENAI	He's not in a coma, remember? They don't know what to call it. They don't know what to do with him so they've given up.
F	ADELE	No, they haven't. We're going to figure it out. They see us...all of us...we have to be quick...this life begs us to come back. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
M	CALI	Dadda!
M	JOSH	She said dad...
F	RENAI	What's this?
M	FOSTER	An award.
F	RENAI	That's today's date. You got this today? Why didn't you tell us, honey? I know it's hard right now. But things will get better. I promise.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	I'm going to show this to your dad.
M	FOSTER	I'm scared, mom.
F	RENAI	Scared of what?
M	FOSTER	Dalton.
F	RENAI	We're all scared. It's normal to be scared for him. But we can't give up--
M	FOSTER	Why do I have to sleep so close to him? Can't I change rooms?
F	RENAI	Why would you wanna change rooms?
M	FOSTER	I don't know.
F	RENAI	Your brother needs you. Goodnight honey.
F	RENAI	Something happened today. I didn't want to tell you in front of Foster.
M	JOSH	What?
F	RENAI	I heard something coming from Cali's room. A man's voice. On the baby monitor...it scared the hell outta me. I went in there and no one was there.
M	JOSH	Could it have been interference?
F	RENAI	I don't know. It was so clear. I was sitting at the piano and I heard this...whispering on the baby monitor. So I held my ear up to it--
M	JOSH	Who the hell is that?
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Stay here.
M	JOSH	Hello? Who's there?
F	RENAI	Who was it, Josh?
M	JOSH	What did you say?
F	RENAI	There's someone in there!
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	There's someone in Cali's room!
M	JOSH	Grab Cali and Foster!
F	RENAI	Josh! The laundry!
M	SECURITY OFFICER	There's no one in there, it's all clear. If someone was there, they're gone now.
F	RENAI	I saw somebody.
M	SECURITY OFFICER	Maybe it was a shadow...?
F	RENAI	No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a man. He was tall, and he long, greasy hair. He was wearing a grey jacket. He looked right at me.
M	SECURITY OFFICER	Well, like I said...he's gone now.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Okay, face the front ladies and gentlemen...come on...hold still... I'm trying to record the peak of your pathetic lives here.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)	Mr. Lambert, would you like to step in please?
M	JOSH	Uh...what?
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Could you step in so that we can take the photo? Quickly please.
M	JOSH	Just take it without me. We need you in the photo, sir.
M	JOSH	No, you don't. Just take the damn photo without me, okay?
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	I can't believe this is my life. Ready kids? Say asshole teacher!
M	ALANSO (O.S.)	I hear things.
M	JOSH	What?
M	ALANSO	I spend so much time in the office, I hear things. I heard about your son. I'm sorry.
M	JOSH	Thank you, Alanso.
M	ALANSO	Times like these...people realize that science doesn't have all the answers. There is a higher force at work.
M	JOSH	I wish I had your belief. Things would be a lot simpler.
M	ALANSO	Things are simple. You just can't see it. Put your faith in Him. Hey...I just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades. It could be a while, there's a lot to go through. Don't wait up. Bye.
M	JOSH	The men all walked down to the waters edge...and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth. And the beast roared back "No!". And so they dived in after it...
F	KELLY	You okay?
F	RENAI	Yeah.
F	KELLY	I was going to head off for an hour or so. Are you alright here?
F	RENAI	Of course. Anything from Dalton?
F	KELLY	No. I'm sorry.
M	KELLY (CONT'D)	Keep providing him with stimuli. I've seen it work time and time again. Read to him. Even if you're doing something else, you can play him music that he likes. Don't give up.
F	RENAI	I won't, I just...I haven't slept much the last couple of nights. I feel like the universe is trying to see how far I can bend before I break.
F	KELLY	The universe picked a fight with the wrong chick.
F	RENAI	Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint.
F	KELLY	No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I chose to be here. You didn't choose any of this. You're the strong one. Renai lets bath salts fall into the tub. She almost looks
M	JOSH	What are you doing up?
F	RENAI	It's midnight, Josh.
M	JOSH	When did you start smoking?
F	RENAI	You've been coming home late every single night. You've never had to do that in all of the years you've been at the school. Now all of a sudden you have to stay back late?
M	JOSH	I don't like it either, but I'm grading tests. What choice do I have? We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.
F	RENAI	Your mother is paying Dalton's bills, Josh. I know because she reminds me every chance she gets.
M	JOSH	Jesus, I can't win with you. That's my son in there too, not just yours!
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	I've always felt like less than good enough for you. I feel it every time you mention our bills. That subtle voice that says `can't you get a job that pays more than a teacher'? And now I can't even look at you without feeling it.
F	RENAI	You're projecting that onto me. You've written an entire story about I'm how I'm feeling without once asking me how I'm feeling.
M	JOSH	I don't need to ask. I know you.
F	RENAI	I am losing my mind here in this house, Josh. I'm scared and I need you and you're not here. Where are you?
M	JOSH	I told you, I'm grading tests.
F	RENAI	I don't mean that. I mean you're not here. With me. In this situation. You're avoiding it, like you do anything stressful, whether it's this or a parking ticket.
M	JOSH	Christ, I should have stayed at the school.
F	RENAI	There you go again.
F	RENAI	Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...
M	MAN	DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!
M	JOSH	What is it? What is it?!
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Renai, what is wrong?!
F	RENAI	The man -- he was there -- he tried to -- there was a man there!!!
M	JOSH	There's no one here.
F	RENAI	I saw somebody!
M	JOSH	There's no one here.
F	RENAI	Don't you dare not believe me!
M	JOSH	I believe you, okay? I just don't know what you want me to do.
F	RENAI	I want you to tell me that we can leave this house. I will not spend one more night here. I wanna leave, I wanna go!
M	FOSTER	I don't want the man to get me.
M	JOSH	You're okay, buddy. I've got you.
F	RENAI	I'm sorry. I can't...I want to leave this house. I can't be here anymore.
M	JOSH	To move now would be...we would have to rent somewhere. It's not--
F	RENAI	Please, Josh.
F	RENAI	Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do any of this. Sit down.
F	LORRAINE	Nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of putting a few things away. I did it for Josh his whole life. He never was good with tidying up.
F	RENAI	I know, but I just feel so bad.
F	LORRAINE	I think it's you who should be sitting down by the looks of it. I can't believe you got Josh to sit still for a photo.
F	RENAI	I can't believe we're doing all this again, that's what I can't believe. I know you think I'm crazy.
F	LORRAINE	Nobody - not me, not anybody - knows what you're going through right now. Whatever you have to do to get through it, do it. And never apologize for it.
F	RENAI	We just wanna say...thank you so much. For helping us out with this, doctor. We can't tell you how much it means to have you involved.
M	DR. TRIMBLE	I'm glad to help. Unfortunately...these recent tests have proven inconclusive. There's absolutely nothing abnormal here.
M	JOSH	So...if you're the top of the food chain with this stuff, where does that leave us?
M	DR. TRIMBLE	I don't know. There is a research team in Boston who specialize in a new form of treatment. They try to stimulate the patients brain with electric pulses. It has a good success rate with victims of brain injury. We could try that.
F	RENAI	So there's hope?
M	DR. TRIMBLE	There are more things we can try. The hope part is up to you. Tip-toe by the window, by the window, that is where I'll be...
M	TINY TIM	Oh tip-toe, from the garden, by the garden, of the willow tree...
M	Bump...bump...bump...	THEN
M	HEARS	it...
F	RENAI	Oh my God, Dalton...no... A child's shoe.
M	BANG!!!	BA G
M	NED	Josh...didn't see you there.
M	JOSH	Sorry to scare you.
M	NED	What are you up to this late?
M	JOSH	Where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go, Ned?
M	NED	Never drink alone. If you take the dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all you're left with is the self loathing.
M	JOSH	I don't need whisky for that.
M	NED	Bah. You people think too much. Used to be, if life threw a shitstorm at you, you'd grab the nearest umbrella. Your generation would spend a day googling what brand to buy.
M	JOSH	I probably would too. It's funny, I've always known I was the type of person that things didn't happen to. I made peace with it. I thought to myself, it's okay - I'll never win the lottery or climb Mount Everest...but I'll never get a rare tropical blood disease either. It works out. Now I'm the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma.
M	NED	Things happen to everybody. Even to good people like you. And they're gonna keep happening the older you get, believe me. No use sittin' in the dark drinkin' over it. Go home. Be with your wife. Tell her your what's on your mind.
M	NED (CONT'D)	There sure as hell isn't any umbrellas `round here.
M	JOSH	This is the first line of a joke. Guy comes home to find his wife with a priest...
F	RENAI	Josh, this is Liam Nathanson. A very old friend of mine.
M	FATHER NATHANSON	Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.
M	JOSH	Can't say I've heard the same, Liam. At least I know you're not sleeping with her.
M	LORRAINE (O.S.)	Don't be rude, Josh.
M	JOSH	What is going on here?
M	FATHER NATHANSON	I should be going. Thank you so much for the tea.
F	RENAI	Thanks, Liam.
M	JOSH	Okay, would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here?
F	LORRAINE	Please sit down, Joshua.
M	JOSH	"Joshua?" Oh Jesus...
F	LORRAINE	Sit down.
M	JOSH	The melodramatic way in which you two are conducting yourselves right now is scaring the shit out of me, so just tell me what's wrong.
F	LORRAINE	Nothing is wrong. We want to talk.
M	JOSH	Nobody asks you to sit down unless something is wrong. If a doctor calls you into his office and asks you to sit down, you're fucked.
F	RENAI	There's no use, Lorraine. He's been drinking.
M	JOSH	I have not been drinking. Not enough that we can't talk to each other, Renai. And don't judge me in that bitchy tone, okay?
F	RENAI	He would never speak to me like that before.
M	JOSH	Christ. You're acting like I'm some lush who comes home and beats you with a belt. At least I'm speaking to you. You suddenly have to speak to a priest. Or my mother who, up until a couple of weeks ago, you couldn't stand.
F	RENAI	You're an asshole.
F	LORRAINE	Your wife needs you. Now sit down and listen to her. I won't ask you again.
M	LORRAINE (CONT'D)	Go on, Renai. Tell him.
F	RENAI	This...thing that was in the other house. It followed us.
F	LORRAINE	Let her speak.
F	RENAI	I saw someone again today. In the house. It looked like a young boy. I followed it into Dalton's room... but it wasn't a child. This thing is here. I know it.
M	JOSH	So...what? You called in a priest to get rid of it?
F	RENAI	I didn't know what else to do.
M	JOSH	Are you kidding me? Was this your idea?
F	RENAI	No. It was mine.
M	JOSH	You've never been to a church in your life. Now you're inviting a priest into our home? I feel like I don't even know you right now.
F	RENAI	I'm scared.
M	JOSH	This is a fantasy, and you need a therapist, not a member of the clergy.
F	RENAI	I told you... What's happening to Renai is real. I've seen it for myself. I came here today because last night I had a dream about this place. I was in this house...but it was late at night.
M	LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I tried to be quiet. I didn't want to wake anybody. I was afraid.
M	LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I looked into your bedroom. You were both asleep.
M	LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I knew that I was asleep in the dream...but I could feel that someone was awake in the house.
M	LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I went into Dalton's room.
M	LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	There was someone in there with him.
M	LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	A man was standing in the corner of the room. I asked him who he was...he said he was a visitor. I asked him what he wanted...he said Dalton.
F	LORRAINE	I can still hear that voice.
M	JOSH	What is it?
F	LORRAINE	He's here.
F	RENAI	Help us...
M	JOSH	I don't know how.
F	LORRAINE	I know somebody who can help...if you're willing to ask for it.
M	SPECS	So you must be Josh?
M	JOSH	Yeah.
M	SPECS	That wasn't psychic. Lorraine told me your name.
M	JOSH	Oh.
M	SPECS	I'm Specs. I'm here to solve your problem. I'm just kidding with the voice. We take this very seriously.
F	RENAI	So is Elise coming or...?
M	SPECS	She won't be joining us yet. Usually we handle all the background stuff, then she gets involved when we have the facts.
M	TUCKER	Helps weed out the nutjobs.
F	RENAI	Okay...
M	JOSH	This is a little uncomfortable. Speaking for myself. I'm not used to this kind of stuff.
M	SPECS	We understand completely. Ninety six per cent of the people we deal with have had no experience with this type of phenomena before. I would like to start by interviewing you both. Can we record your answers?
F	RENAI	Ah...sure.
M	SPECS	My assistant will check different areas of the house for electrical anomalies. I'll get him started. Tucker, would you follow me?
M	TUCKER	Assistant?
M	SPECS	Could you not eat that in front of the clients?
M	TUCKER	Assistant?
M	SPECS	Finish it in here. This industry gets laughed at enough as it is.
M	SPECS	Do you or any of your children suffer from epilepsy or autism?
F	RENAI	No. I mean, our son...
M	SPECS	Right. I heard about this from Lorraine. He is in a coma, the cause of which is unknown?
F	RENAI	Yes. Do either of you habitually use drugs or alcohol?
F	RENAI	No.
M	SPECS	No drugs at all?
F	RENAI	I take anti-depressants sometimes.
M	SPECS	Do you have a history of clinical depression?
F	RENAI	Not a history. I've had bouts of it. In the past.
M	SPECS	Tucker, could you check the camera?
M	TUCKER (O.S.)	I'm still assisting in the other room.
M	SPECS	Whenever you're ready then.
M	TUCKER	He handles administration, I handle technical. It's an even split. He couldn't change a light bulb and I'm no good with paperwork. It bores me senseless.
M	SPECS	Do you have any history of sexual abuse in the family?
M	JOSH	No. I'm sorry, I have to ask how this relates to our problem?
M	SPECS	Nine times out of ten, when someone comes to us with a problem like this, it's because of an inward cause within the family unit...not a physical force outside of it.
M	JOSH	What is that?
M	TUCKER	Tri-field meter. It measures DC fields and the natural electro magnetic environment.
M	SPECS	Sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere. It can cause hallucinations, changes in energy.
M	TUCKER	Yeah. It's a little more complicated than that, but, you know, you get the general idea.
M	SPECS	It's basically that.
M	TUCKER	Not really, but whatever.
M	SPECS	The tech stuff's not relevant to you anyway.
M	TUCKER	It's very relevant, but it's all good.
M	SPECS	Epilepsy in one of the children mostly. It's very common. If we approach things academically, it lets us find the genuinely interesting cases.
M	TUCKER	I think we can call Elise now...
M	JOSH	Mrs. Rainier?
F	ELISE	No, my mother couldn't come, it's just me. Elise. You must be Lorraine's son? You've grown since I last saw you.
M	JOSH	Last saw me?
F	ELISE	Your mother and I have been friends for a long time.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	They're very good assistants but I can't get them to dress any better.
F	RENAI	Hi. I'm Renai.
F	ELISE	Pleased to meet you. I'm Elise.
M	TUCKER	We took Tri-field and EMF readings of the whole house. All the wiring, alarm clocks, radios, toasters, TV, record player, fuse box. Nothing went off the charts.
F	ELISE	And the previous home?
M	SPECS	Tucker hadn't monitored that yet. I could jump on that this afternoon if you like? Make up for lost time.
M	TUCKER	Yeah, but who would work the equipment? I'll need to be there. You know what, don't even sweat it. I'll make myself available.
F	ELISE	No, that's fine, gentlemen.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	I don't think bad wiring is the problem here.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Hmm.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	May I walk through the house?
F	RENAI	Yes. Of course.
F	ELISE	Steven, do you have your sketchbook?
M	SPECS	Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, yes. I do.
F	ELISE	Good. We're going to need it.
F	RENAI	What is it for?
M	SPECS	She tells me what she sees and I draw it. It's the most important part of her process.
M	TUCKER	His drawings and my photos comprise her visual records.
M	SPECS	Especially the drawings.
M	TUCKER	That's debatable.
M	SPECS	It's not debatable.
M	TUCKER	It is, but whatever.
M	SPECS	Onwards and upwards. Find me a ghost.
M	--hallway.	
F	RENAI	What is it?
F	ELISE	There is something here.
M	TUCKER	This is where I saw it.
F	ELISE	...long hair...grey dress...her eyes are...
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Do I have permission to enter this room?
M	JOSH	Go ahead.
F	ELISE	Maybe you could wait back there?
F	ELISE	Leave the lights off. T E R R O R.
F	RENAI	What is it? What do you see? What do you see?!
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Tell me!
F	ELISE	I'm not sure if you are ready to hear this yet...but unfortunately I can't waste any time easing you into it. There is no time left.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	I want you to know that this is what I believe and it may contradict a previous medical diagnosis. However, you called me here and I am taking that as an acceptance of my readings.
F	RENAI	Go on.
F	ELISE	Your son...is not in a coma. His physical body is here, but his spiritual body is not. The reason these disturbances followed you to a new home is because...it is not the house that is haunted. It is your son.
F	RENAI	I don't understand... Elise considers what she is about to say carefully.
F	ELISE	Have you ever heard of astral projection?
F	RENAI	Out of body experiences?
F	ELISE	I call them travellers. These are people with the ability to leave their physical body and travel to different places in an astral form. To some degree, we all have the ability to do it...but most of us subconsciously suppress it or don't know how to access it.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Dalton is...a very accomplished astral projector. He has been since he was very young. He's not afraid of his ability. And that lack of fear has led him to travel too far and become lost...
F	RENAI	Lost? Lost where?
F	ELISE	In The Further.
F	RENAI	What do you mean?
F	ELISE	The Further is that place beyond our perception, beyond our understanding of the physical world that we can see and touch. It is a place without clocks or measurements, without past or future...an infinite realm that holds all of our dreams...and all of our nightmares. That is where Dalton is.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	The problem is that with his astral body gone, he has left a physical body with us. An empty vessel. And there are entities that know this. They can smell it - the chance to live again. That is why they have gathered around him.
F	RENAI	How many are there?
F	ELISE	There are five benevolent spirits. Five different entities for whom Dalton has become a most prized possession. They are trying to get inside his physical body...and they get closer with each passing day.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Then there are two entities who are...not benevolent. One of them takes the form of a man, the other...
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	They work together, so desperate are they to possess Dalton. They are the closest of all the entities to getting inside him. I don't want to scare you, but I have never, in all my years of doing this, experienced anything as terrifying as their presence.
F	RENAI	Is there a way to bring Dalton back?
F	ELISE	There is something we could try. A way of calling him back. I would need your complete trust.
M	JOSH	No. No. This has gone too far.
F	RENAI	You said that you'd give her a chance!
M	JOSH	I have given her a chance, and I did that because I wanted to help you. But I cannot have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in another dimension.
F	ELISE	I know this is hard to hear.
M	JOSH	No, it's not fair is what it is. You're preying on people's grief and vulnerability, which is really easy to do in a situation like this.
F	RENAI	Why did we go to all the trouble of bringing them here if you're just going to reject what they say?
M	JOSH	Because I wanted to help you. To put your mind at ease, and if this helped, then great. But to drag Dalton into this? No.
F	RENAI	Josh, you're not being fair...
M	JOSH	Fair? How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here? Don't you see? You want to believe. Of course you do, honey, anybody would. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do. I really do. But I think it's dangerous to start throwing out false hope like this. I have to put my foot down. My wife is not...mentally well at the moment, and I have to keep at least one of her feet here in the real world.
F	RENAI	You never believed me...
M	JOSH	Honey, I'm on your side. But I genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly, a little exploitative. You come into a home with a seriously ill child, you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences Renai is having and viola - the client starts crying because they're desperate to believe, the tears validate your power, thank you, that'll be six hundred dollars please.
M	SPECS	We reject more cases than we take. We're not out for money, sir.
M	JOSH	I know, I know...look, I appreciate your interest and your time. I do. Thank you. Thank you very much.
F	ELISE	I completely understand. And I honestly don't blame you for reacting like this.
F	RENAI	No, please...don't go.
F	ELISE	Thank you for your time.
M	JOSH	Look at me for a second, honey. Look at me. Did you really believe what she said? In your heart of hearts, did you actually take what she was saying literally?
F	RENAI	I don't know...
M	JOSH	Do you think I don't want to believe in that stuff? Of course I do. It would make life a lot easier if I did. If I believed that some supernatural force was responsible for what's happened to our son... I don't believe anything anymore, Josh. I used to. I used to believe that I could keep my children safe. I used to believe everything would be okay. To believe in something, you have to know it to be true.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	The things that have happened to me haven't confirmed any beliefs - they've done the opposite. They've made me question what I believe.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	They've made me realize that maybe we don't know as much as we think we do.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	You ask me if I believe what she said to be true and the answer is I don't know. But let me ask you this - in your heart of hearts, can you say for certain that it isn't?
M	JOSH	Where are you? Where did you go? Can you hear me? I'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...I don't know how to help you. Please tell me what to do. Please God, please help me...give me my son back. I will do anything just to have him back.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	I need him back. I need him to show me that he can hear me. Please...
M	JOSH	Okay.
F	ELISE	What's most important is that you realize no two attempts are the same. I will be completely honest with you about the results, and if no dialogue is established, I will tell you. I am not in the business of embellishing success. What happens, happens.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Forget the limits and laws and logic of this world. We are treading in a different place now.
M	TUCKER	These still cameras are rigged to pick up changes in the atmosphere, electrical or temperature-wise. Don't be alarmed if they go off.
F	ELISE	Everything I say while I am in tune will be at a very low volume, so you won't hear any of it. Steven will write it down and repeat it for you.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Hold on to each other, and stay focused. You'll see things you don't understand. Confusing things. Do not question them or speak in any way.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Dim the lights please.
M	we are calling out to you dalton	Renai grips Josh's hand tightly.
M	SPECS	We are calling out to you Dalton. Tell us that you are safe. Tell us where you are. who's there? Who's there? it is your mother and father we have been looking for you It is your mother and father. We have been looking for you.
M	i need help i can't see in here	I need help...I can't see in here.
M	follow my voice dalton come back to us	Follow my voice Dalton. Come back to us.
M	Why aren't you talking anymore dalton?	Why aren't you talking anymore Dalton?
M	if they hear me they'll hurt me	If they hear me, they'll hurt me. Who will hurt you?
M	the man with fire on his face	The man with fire on his face. Can you find your way back to us?
M	there is no way out	There is no way out.
M	follow my voice dalton	Follow my voice Dalton.
M	be quiet they'll hear you	Be quiet, they'll hear you.
M	they are coming they heard you help me	helpme mom and dad please save me please come and get mepleasecomeandgetmecome Elise's head TWITCHES as Specs' writes furiously, trying to
M	dalton are you there? dalton?	An agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl:
F	ELISE	Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel! LEAVE THIS VESSEL!
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Leave this earthly body!
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Leave his body!
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	The lights!
F	RENAI	Dalton!
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Dalton! Dalton!
M	SPECS	I feel like a mountain climber who's been waiting his whole life to climb Everest, and now that I'm standing on the summit, I don't know what to do with myself...
M	TUCKER	I'll tell you what we do with ourselves. We make a short list of our preferred media outlets, that's what.
M	TUCKER (CONT'D)	Watch this.
M	SPECS	Oh my God...
M	TUCKER	After all the years we've been dining out on morsels like a faucet that turns itself on and off...we finally have some empirical evidence of the real thing. Proof.
F	ELISE	Proof? Proof of what? Nine tenths of the world believes that when you die, your soul ascends to sit with God. Would you be telling them something they didn't already know?
M	TUCKER	That is so not the point. This is not about religion. Here we have irrefutable evidence of a paranormal experience. Our job is to share it.
F	ELISE	and prove the existence of the `paranormal', as you call it. I'm not out to prove anything. I've known there was a higher plane ever since I was a little girl and I could play hopscotch with people whose names were inscribed on tombstones. What you call paranormal is a fact of life for me. Our job is to help people. The least we can do is spare them the indignity of Sixty Minutes.
M	TUCKER	Yeah, until they get their book deal...then you'll wish you'd listened.
F	ELISE	No, I won't, Tucker. I'll just be proud of you. You two stared down something that would crush most mortals tonight and you stood tall.
M	SPECS	So what do we do now?
F	ELISE	We answer the door.
M	SPECS	What do you mean?
M	JOSH	Mom...what are you doing here?
F	ELISE	I asked your mother to come over. I called her immediately after...the session. I told her to hurry over.
M	JOSH	Why?
F	ELISE	There is something we must talk about. Sit down, Lorraine.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Go on. Tell him.
M	JOSH	Tell me what?
F	LORRAINE	The reason...I knew to call Elise in this situation...the reason I know her so well...is because I called her myself once. Years ago.
M	LORRAINE (CONT'D)	To help you, Josh.
M	JOSH	What are you talking about?
F	ELISE	It's no accident that your son is such a gifted traveller. The ability was handed down to him. By his father.
M	JOSH	No...I've never...done that before.
F	LORRAINE	When you were about eight...you suffered night terrors. Awful fits of pure fear. You were terrified of an old woman who you said would come to visit you at night.
M	OLD WOMAN	Let me in.
F	LORRAINE	I dismissed your stories. Told you to grow up. Then I saw her for myself.
M	LORRAINE (CONT'D)	At first, I thought it was a camera problem. Then I saw her again.
M	LORRAINE (CONT'D)	In each photo, she got closer and closer to you...
M	LORRAINE (CONT'D)	Finally, I was so scared, I called Elise.
M	JOSH	I don't...I don't remember any of this...
F	ELISE	You've blocked it out. But in the back of your mind, you're still afraid of having your picture taken, aren't you?
F	LORRAINE	I've kept the photos hidden ever since then...until tonight.
F	ELISE	I advised Lorraine to hide them. To stop taking your picture. And to let you forget.
M	JOSH	Who is she?
F	ELISE	A parasite. She befriended your astral body, then drew you out into The Further, just as Dalton has been drawn out.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	But she deceived you. All she wanted was an empty vessel. A physical body. Yours.
F	LORRAINE	I'm sorry, Josh.
F	ELISE	I didn't want to make you remember this...I only do it for the sake of your son.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Your son is out there. And you are the only one who can bring him back.
M	JOSH	How long do we have before...that thing...takes him over completely?
F	ELISE	If you cannot reach him tonight, then he is gone forever.
F	ELISE	Remember who you are and why you are traveling. Keep one foot in this world. Are you ready?
F	RENAI	I want you to know something...you have never been less than good enough for me. You've always been perfect for me. You're my best friend...my soulmate. I love you so much.
M	JOSH	I love you too. I have since the first time you looked at me. I don't exist without you.
F	ELISE	Close your eyes, Josh...and relax. Breathe deeply. Let all life around you fade out into the background...until the only thing you can hear is the ticking of the metronome.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Focus on a spot in the center of your forehead. Feel that spot getting further away as you drift off to sleep.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	I want you to relax your physical body and let the astral body gain strength...feel it rising out of your chest.
M	ELISE (CONT'D)	Detach yourself.
M	JOSH	This is useless...I have no idea what I'm doing and you just suddenly expect me to...
F	ELISE	Now you are free. Keep your guide, and a steady stride...and into The Further you go. As he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the A LIFE.
F	ELISE	He's in... He is walking.
M	JOSH	Dalton? Dalton? Where are you?
M	JOSH	Dalton?
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Dalton?
M	JOSH	Where is Dalton?
M	JOSH	Do you know where Dalton is?
M	MAN	Why do I have to put up with you? What a tramp. You call this a home? I work all day for this?
M	JOSH	Dalton? Where are you?
M	DALTON (O.S.)	Dad...
M	JOSH	I'm looking for my son, Dalton.
M	JOSH	DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!!
M	DALTON (O.S.)	Dad....
M	JOSH	DALTON!
M	DALTON (O.S.)	Dad...help me...
M	JOSH	DALTON!!
M	LONG HAIRED MAN	I hear you... I hear you, but you don't know what you've done.
M	LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)	There is a place that you can't go to and this is that place.
M	LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)	YOU MADE A MISTAKE!! I'M GOING TO MAKE SUFFERING A FUCKING BLESSING FOR YOU! I'M GOING TO RIP YOU APART YOU CUNT!!
F	RENAI	What's happening to him?!
F	ELISE	You're stronger then they are, Josh. You are a living soul!
M	JOSH	Get...off..me!
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Get away from me! Leave now!
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Dalton!! I'm here...
M	JOSH	Dalton! Here...
M	JOSH	Dalton...?
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	I'm taking you back. What is it?
M	DALTON	Help me, dad...take this off me...
M	JOSH	You're not really here. You're asleep in your bed in our home. Just stand up.
M	DALTON	He's going to hurt me again...
M	JOSH	This isn't real. You can do this.
M	DALTON	He's coming!
M	JOSH	Just stand up!
M	RED-FACED MAN	This...issssss....real!
M	RED-FACED MAN (CONT'D)	That...issss...my....boy!
F	RENAI	Help him!
M	RED-FACED MAN	You're here now! With ussss!
M	JOSH	....ome....onnnnn...
F	ELISE	They've made contact. I know it. He's found your son.
F	RENAI	What happens now?
F	ELISE	We need them to come back. We need him to find us.
M	JOSH	I want to get out!
M	JOSH	....eeeeet out!
F	ELISE	Call out to him!
M	DALTON	Listen!
M	RENAI (V.O.)	Josh, follow my voice...
F	RENAI	Follow my voice. Come back to us.
M	RENAI (V.O.)	Find us... Renai's voice cries out from behind the door at the top of
M	RENAI (V.O.)	Hurry! Come back to us!
M	DALTON	Put me down, I can run!
M	DALTON (CONT'D)	Come on, dad! Come on!
M	JOSH	Go! I'm right behind you! You...what do you want from me?
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Get the fuck away from me! I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me! Find us!
F	ELISE	Check on the boy!
M	SPECS	He's awake!
M	DALTON	Mom...
F	ELISE	Find me, Josh! Now! Wake up!
F	RENAI	Josh? Josh?
M	JOSH	Dalton...?
F	RENAI	I don't know what to say...
F	ELISE	Well put.
M	JOSH	Now this is worth dying for.
M	TUCKER	I guess you did some pretty awesome stuff in there. You deserve some credit.
M	SPECS	You did good too in an assistant- type way.
M	TUCKER	Thanks, boss.
M	TUCKER (CONT'D)	Dude, I got some amazing shots. We are gonna write a book and my shots are gonna be the main selling point.
M	SPECS	Yeah. Not the main selling point, but definitely important, for sure.
M	DALTON	I'm tired.
F	RENAI	Too bad. I'm never letting you go to sleep again.
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Did you know we'd come and find you? Whenever you're lost...we'll always come and find you.
M	JOSH	You introduced me to a new world.
F	ELISE	No. You've been there before, remember? And you'll go back. All of us will...eventually.
M	JOSH	Maybe I can forget again.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	I'll start by giving these back.
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	What's wrong?
F	ELISE	Nothing, I...
M	JOSH	What's the matter, Elise?
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	Why the fuck would you do that? Why would you do that? Why?!
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	You of all people! You know! Why would you do that to me when you know what you know? You bitch!
F	RENAI	What was that? Stay here.
F	RENAI	Elise, what was that noise?
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Jesus...what happened to you?
M	RENAI (CONT'D)	Where's Josh? Josh? Josh?!
F	RENAI	Elise, what happened? You're scaring me, tell me where Josh is?
M	JOSH	You introduced me to a new world.
F	ELISE	No. You've been there before, remember? And you'll go back. All of us will...eventually.
M	JOSH	Maybe I can forget again. I'll start by giving these back. What's wrong?
F	ELISE	Nothing, I...
M	JOSH	What's the matter, Elise?
M	DALTON	Put me down, I can run!
M	DALTON (CONT'D)	Come on, dad! Come on!
M	JOSH	Go! I'm right behind you!
M	JOSH (CONT'D)	You...what do you want from me?
M	JOSH	Get away the fuck away from me. I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me!
