M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	RYAN	How much does your life weigh?
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. The stuff in drawers and on shelves. The collectables and knick-knacks. Feel the weight as it adds up. Now, start adding the larger stuff. Your clothes, table top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy at this point - Go Bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in... Your car, get it in there... Your home, whether you have a studio apartment or a two story house, I want you to stuff it into that backpack.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Now try to walk.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake - Moving is living.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Now, I'm going to set your backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some gingko and let the photos burn. In fact let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It's kind of exhilarating isn't it? That is how I approach every day.
M	FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Do you want the cancer?
M	RYAN	Excuse me?
M	FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Do you want the cancer?
M	FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT	The can, sir?
M	RYAN	Oh... No. Um, no thank you.
M	Two words - Subordinate chic.	
M	STEVE	Who the fuck are you?
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Excellent question. Who the fuck am I? Poor Steve has worked here for seven years.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	He's never had a meeting with me before...
M	RYAN (V.O.)	...or passed me in the hall...
M	RYAN (V.O.)	... or told me a story in the break room.... And that's because I don't work here. I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss...
M	RYAN (V.O.)	... who don't have the balls to sack their own employees. And in some cases, for good reason. Because, people do crazy shit when they get fired.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	And that's where I come in.
M	STEVE	What did I... do? What could I have done differently here?
M	RYAN	This is not an assessment of your productivity. It's important not to personalize this. Steve, I want you to review this packet. Take it seriously. I think you're going to find a lot of answers in there.
M	STEVE	Oh, I'm sure it's going be really helpful.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Look, anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	I'm going to need your key card.
M	STEVE	Right...
M	RYAN	Take the day. Put together your personal things. Talk to your co- workers. Tomorrow, go out and get some exercise. Go for a jog. Give yourself routines and pretty soon you'll find your legs.
M	STEVE	Wait, how do I get in touch with you?
M	RYAN	Don't worry. We'll be in touch soon. This is just the beginning.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	I'll never see Steve again.
M	CHECKOUT GIRL	Do you have your Hilton Honors Card with you?
M	CHECKOUT GIRL	Oh my God... Do you like, live, at the Hilton?
M	RYAN (V.O.)	This is where I live.
M	Subtitles - "Airworld"	
M	AIRPORT CLERK	Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	When I run my card, the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement.
M	AIRPORT CLERK	Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Had my status simply been gold or God-forbid, silver. I might have gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Loyalty is earned and rewarded with these small touches. It's these kinds of systemized friendly touches that keep my world in orbit.
M	ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS	Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	All the things you probably hate about travelling - The recycled air. The artificial lighting. The digital juice dispensers and mini pizzas stacked to their heat lamps are the warm reminders that I am home.
M	KEVIN	Ryan Bingham's office.
M	RYAN	You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.
M	KEVIN	They are completely out of all full sized sedans... Did you?...
M	KEVIN	Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable #1 Gold Club status and years in the program. They are moving mountains to see you in a Sebring.
M	RYAN	Fair enough. Any other messages?
M	KEVIN	Your sister Kara called. Needs to speak urgently about your sister's wedding. I told her you were midair and not even I knew your final destination.
M	RYAN	Well done.
M	KEVIN	And you got an invitation to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.
M	RYAN	GoalQuest twenty?
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Every once in a while I do speaking engagements. Motivational kind of stuff. But GoalQuest... We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.
M	KEVIN	It's got a hologram. They're calling it Dos Equis. That's some pretty major Tony Robbins shit there.
M	RYAN	Talk about burying the lead. I'll check in when...
M	KEVIN	Hold on, I have Craig Gregory for you...
M	RYAN	I... ah, fuck...
M	CRAIG GREGORY	How's the road warrior?
M	RYAN	Twenty minutes from boarding into a world of bliss.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Great numbers out of Phoenix. You know Big Auto is going to drop another 10K this month.
M	RYAN	No kidding?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Yeah, Christmas came early. Wish I could have you in five places at once. I need you back in Omaha by the end of the week.
M	RYAN	I thought you needed me everywhere. We got something big - Game changer.
M	RYAN	I don't know why you ever bring me in. Wherever I go, the money follows. Let me plant seeds, they'll grow to Oaks.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I'm thinking of planting seeds right now.
M	RYAN	What are we talking about here?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	You'll see. Today, I took my first crap in two weeks. Hallelujah.
M	RYAN	That's me, hanging up on you.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Good. I love that sound.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	To know me is to fly with me. I'm the aisle, you're the window - trapped.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	We start chatting, impersonally at first. Our moderate politics, our sinking opinions on the American service industry.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	You recommend a hotel in Tulsa. I tip you off to a rib joint in Fort Worth.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	You tell me your best joke. I've heard it before, but listen anyway.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Nothing like turbulence to cement a bond. Soon you're telling me about family.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Your wife just went back to work but you can't intervene because you sure could use the extra paycheck and besides, last June she read some book and woke up one morning a feminist.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	And that if your windfall ever came through, you'd quit and spend the rest of your days restoring vintage speedboats. The water. That's where you belong. We exchange cards and slot them next to countless others.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Fast friends aren't my only friends, but my best friends.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch. I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here. I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a new species. I live between the margins of my itineraries.
M	RYAN	Hello?
M	KARA (O.C.)	Hi Ryan. Every family has one person who is the glue. The one who keeps the genealogy in check. That's my sister Kara - The glue.
M	RYAN	Hey Kara.
F	KARA	How are you holding up?
M	RYAN	Just fine. You? The kids?
F	KARA	Missy's outstanding. Matthew made varsity. How's the road?
M	RYAN	Couldn't be better.
F	KARA	That's good. So, Ryan?
M	RYAN	Yeah?
F	KARA	I didn't even want to have to ask you for this, because I know how you are about... doing things for others... But we're coming in on three weeks to go for Julie's wedding and there's something we could really use your help on.
M	RYAN	Yeah.
F	KARA	We've been sending people these kits so they can print out photos of Julie and Jim on cardboard, and take photos of them in interesting places kind of like that gnome in the French movie.
M	RYAN	Why?
F	KARA	Because it's Julie's wedding... and she thinks it's fun. Does it matter why?
M	RYAN	How is Julie?
F	KARA	Would you call her? She thinks you've turned to butter - Disappeared. You're awfully isolated, the way you live.
M	RYAN	Isolated? I'm surrounded.
F	KARA	Your assistant told me you're going to be in Vegas.
M	RYAN	Did he?
F	KARA	Can you get a photo of the cut-out in front of the Luxor Pyramid?
M	RYAN	That place is a shit hole. No one stays there.
F	KARA	Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in. Can you just take a stupid photo?
M	RYAN	I'm going to try my best.
F	KARA	Well, thank you for trying your best.
M	RYAN	You're satisfied with Maestro?
F	ALEX	Yeah, I am.
M	RYAN	They're stingy with their miles. I like Hertz.
F	ALEX	Hertz keeps its vehicles too long. If a car's over twenty-thousand miles, I won't drive it.
M	RYAN	Maestro doesn't instant check out. I like to park and go.
F	ALEX	Hertz doesn't guarantee Navigation.
M	RYAN	Funny, you don't seem like a girl who needs directions.
F	ALEX	I hate asking for directions. That's why I get a Nav.
M	RYAN	The new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.
F	ALEX	Is that a joke?
M	RYAN	Yes.
F	ALEX	Their kiosk placement is a joke.
M	RYAN	Never have available upgrades.
F	ALEX	It's basically a fleet of shit boxes - Don't know how they're still in business.
M	RYAN	I'm Ryan.
F	ALEX	Alex.
M	RYAN	So are you going to join me?
M	RYAN	Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into this palace.
F	ALEX	Hilton offers equal value and better food - But the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in.
M	RYAN	They got you with the cookies?
F	ALEX	I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.
M	RYAN	There's actually an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey. It's faumey.
F	ALEX	Oh my God. I've heard about these, but never seen one in person. Is this a...?
M	RYAN	Concierge Key. Yeah.
F	ALEX	I love the weight.
M	RYAN	Graphite. I was pretty excited the day that puppy came in.
F	ALEX	I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. Sixty thou a year, domestic.
M	RYAN	That's not bad.
F	ALEX	Don't patronize me. What's your total?
M	RYAN	That's a personal question.
F	ALEX	Oh please...
M	RYAN	I hardly know you.
F	ALEX	Show some hubris. Impress me. I bet it's huge.
M	RYAN	You have no idea.
F	ALEX	Come on... Is it this big? ... this big?
M	RYAN	Let's just say I've got a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet.
F	ALEX	This is pretty fucking sexy.
M	RYAN	I hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.
F	ALEX	We're two people who get turned on by elite status. We may have to settle for cheap.
M	RYAN	There's nothing cheap about loyalty.
M	RYAN	I really have to start throwing these out.
F	ALEX	We can always use that room with the ice machine.
M	RYAN	Good call on the towel rack.
F	ALEX	Thanks. I liked how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions.
M	RYAN	I was improvising.
F	ALEX	Too bad we didn't make it to the closet.
M	RYAN	We got to do this again.
M	RYAN	I'm in Newark on the 12th, Madesto on the 13th, Oklahoma City on the 15th.
F	ALEX	Any Southwest? I'm swinging through Albuquerque the week of the 16th?
M	RYAN	No, but I'll be in Florida by the 20th.
F	ALEX	Miami?
M	RYAN	Ft. Lauderdale.
F	ALEX	That's nothing.
M	RYAN	Forty minutes.
F	ALEX	I should probably go back to my room so I can wake up in my bed.
M	RYAN	I think that's the lady like thing to do. Last year, I spent three hundred twenty two days on the road.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Which means that I had to spend forty three miserable days at home.
M	NOSEY NEIGHBOR	Ryan?
M	RYAN	Hi...
M	NOSEY NEIGHBOR	Feels like it's been months, busy man. We missed you at our Summer party.
M	RYAN	Yeah, sorry I couldn't be there.
M	NOSEY NEIGHBOR	We've been trying to get a vote on the new landscaping. Can I e-mail you the plans...? We'd love to get a final tally.
M	RYAN	It's fine. Really. I'll go with the majority.
M	NOSEY NEIGHBOR	Sometimes I forget that you even live here. You could probably save money and move into a hotel. I looked into it, but the IRS requires a permanent address for employment. Otherwise, they classify you as a vagrant.
M	NOSEY NEIGHBOR	Oh.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Hey neighbor.
M	RYAN	Hey yourself.
F	DIANNE	I signed for this while you were gone.
M	RYAN	Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother.
F	DIANNE	They seem happy.
M	RYAN	It's my sister. She's getting married. Haven't met the guy yet.
F	DIANNE	Lots of luck.
M	RYAN	I know, right?
F	DIANNE	It's good to see you. Feels like a while this time.
M	RYAN	Hey, you want to come over tonight?
F	DIANNE	Actually, I kind of started seeing somebody.
M	RYAN	Oh, that's... that's great.
F	DIANNE	Yeah, we're having drinks tonight if you want to come over.
M	RYAN	That's okay... I' think I'll settle in.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Just thrilled to have everyone under one roof. Welcome home boys.
M	CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)	I know there's are lot of whispering about why we're all here. Retailers are down twenty percent. Auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat. This is our moment. It's one of the worst times on record for America... and I don't want to be standing here two years from now, wondering how we missed this window of opportunity.
M	CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)	Now, last Summer we received a dynamite young woman by way of Cornell. She challenged us with some big ideas. My first reaction was, who does this kid think she is? But when I started to give a listen, I was pretty knocked out. So now, with a little peek into our future - Natalie Keener.
F	NATALIE	If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this...
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Glocal.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Our global must become local.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	This company keeps twenty three people on the road, at least two hundred fifty days a year. It's expensive and it's inefficient. When I came to Craig three months ago with this, he told me, and quite astutely - it's only a problem if you have a solution.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Well, today I stand before you with jus that.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	You all know Ned in reception.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Today, I'm going to fire Ned. Sorry, Ned. I'm sure H.R. will hire you back this afternoon.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Ned could be any employee in any one of our client's locations worldwide. Strategy packets would be shipped in advance. Ned would be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting for him.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Mr. Laskin, the reason we're having this conversation today is your position is no longer available.
M	NED	I don't understand. I'm fired?
F	NATALIE	Hearing the words "You've been let go" is never easy. Change is always scary. But consider the following - Anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.
M	RYAN	That's my fucking line.
M	NED	Well, what happens now?
F	NATALIE	This is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new job that fulfills you.
M	NED	Yeah, but, how does it work?
F	NATALIE	I want you to take that packet in front of you.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Review it. All the answers you're looking for are inside. Start filling out the necessary information and before you know it, you'll be on your way to new opportunities.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Now Ned, I'm going to need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things. As a favor to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet. Panic doesn't help anybody.
M	NED	I understand.
F	NATALIE	Have a good day, Mr. Laskin and good luck with your future.
M	NED	Thank you.
F	NATALIE	Give it up for Ned.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line. Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by eighty-five percent... And most importantly to you guys on the road... No more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa... No more hours lost to weather delays... You get to come home.
M	RYAN	Tell me you're not taking this seriously.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Yeah, that's why we brought the entire company in from the road - Because we're not taking this seriously.
M	RYAN	It doesn't make any sense. It's... ... completely impersonal.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Who am I even talking to?
M	RYAN	There's a methodology to what I do. A reason why it works.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing it for years. Just like anything, there's a few months of transition, but everyone settles in.
M	RYAN	Who are you taking off the road? A beat.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan. Everyone is. It's done.
M	RYAN	Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way I do it.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Stabbing people in the chest instead of the back?
F	NATALIE	You wanted to see me?
M	RYAN	Yeah, why don't you come in.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Great job in there, Nat.
F	NATALIE	Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
M	RYAN	Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And you have some good ideas. But you know nothing of the realities of my job. Sure, you can set up an iChat... but you don't know how people think.
F	NATALIE	Actually, I minored in psychology.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Nice.
M	RYAN	Okay kiddo, fire me.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Ryan, stop it.
M	RYAN	She's going to be doing this on a regular basis. You don't want to know if she can fire somebody?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	She just fired Ned.
M	RYAN	My dog could fire Ned. Fire me.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Ryan.
F	NATALIE	It's okay, I got this.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you that your position is no longer available.
M	RYAN	Who the hell are you?
F	NATALIE	My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to discuss your future.
M	RYAN	My future? I don't know you. The only person who can fire me is Craig Gregory.
F	NATALIE	Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this for him.
M	RYAN	Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory hired me and he's the only one who can fire me. I'm going to talk to him.
F	NATALIE	Mr. Bingham...
M	RYAN	You can't follow me... You're on a computer screen. Remember?
F	NATALIE	Ryan...
M	RYAN	Try again. Fire me.
F	NATALIE	I just did.
M	RYAN	Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Stop it, Ryan.
F	NATALIE	Mr. Bingham, I'm here today to inform you that your position is no longer available.
M	RYAN	I'm fired?
F	NATALIE	Yes, you're fired.
M	RYAN	Never say fired.
F	NATALIE	You've been let go.
M	RYAN	Why?
F	NATALIE	This is a mythical situation. How could I possibly know why?
M	RYAN	You never know why. Why doesn't matter.
F	NATALIE	It's important not to focus on the "why" and rather to spend your energy thinking about your future.
M	RYAN	I'm going to spend my energy on suing you if you don't give me a reason that you're firing me.
F	NATALIE	Mr. Bingham, the reason is not important.
M	RYAN	Oh, so you're firing me without grounds. Now, I really have a lawsuit.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Ryan, I think we know what you're trying to say...
F	NATALIE	Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.
M	RYAN	Personally? This is the most personal situation you will ever enter. So before you try to revolutionize my business, I'd like to know that you actually know my business.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the team.
M	RYAN	Am I the only one who sees that by automating our own business, we're making ourselves irrelevant.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	No... We're making you irrelevant.
M	CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)	Hey, don't blame me. Blame fuel costs. Blame insurance premiums. Blame technology. Watch yourself, Ryan. You're too young to be a dinosaur...
M	RYAN	I'm not... I'm not a dinosaur.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I want you to show her the ropes.
M	RYAN	What do I know about what happens around here? Have Ferguson do it.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I'm not talking about here.
M	RYAN	No.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Hey, you seem pretty confident that this girl doesn't know what she's doing...
M	RYAN	Excuse me. I just don't think a MySpace page qualifies you to rewire an entire company.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Great. Well, here's your chance. Show her the magic. Take her through the paces.
M	RYAN	I'm not a fucking tour guide.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	This is the boat.
M	CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)	This is you.
M	CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)	Do you want to be in the boat?
M	RYAN	Yes. Alone.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Ryan, we're ringing the bell. Rounding everybody up. If you want to stay out there a little longer, you can. But you're not going to be on your own. Let me know.
M	RYAN	Huh.
F	NATALIE	What?
F	NATALIE	I really like my luggage.
M	RYAN	That's exactly what it is. Luggage. You know how much time you lose by checking in?
F	NATALIE	I don't know, maybe five minutes waiting for...
M	RYAN	Thirty five minutes per flight. I travel two hundred seventy days a year. That makes one hundred fifty seven hours... That's Seven Days. You ready to throw away a whole week on that?
M	RYAN	Bingo. Asians.
F	NATALIE	You can't be serious.
M	RYAN	Never get behind people travelling with infants. I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on Earth.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Five words. Randomly selected for additional screening. Asians. They're light packers, treasure efficiency, and have a thing for slip-on shoes. God love'em.
F	NATALIE	That's racist.
M	RYAN	I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster.
M	RYAN	Are you upset at your laptop?
F	NATALIE	No. Why?
M	RYAN	Fats Domino had a lighter touch.
F	NATALIE	I type with purpose.
M	RYAN	What are you working on so furiously?
F	NATALIE	I'm building a work flow of firing techniques. Questions & responses. Actions & reactions. A script that works kind of like a tributary, taking you through the steps of firing someone.
M	RYAN	Who is it for?
F	NATALIE	Theoretically, you could put it in the hands of anybody and they could be downsizing immediately. All they have to do is follow the steps.
M	RYAN	Natalie, what is it, you think we do here?
F	NATALIE	We prepare the newly unemployed for the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting while... Minimizing potential legal blowback?
M	RYAN	That's what we're selling. But it's not what we're doing.
F	NATALIE	Okay, what are we doing?
M	RYAN	Our job is to make limbo tolerable - To ferry wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at which hope's bright shore is dimly visible... And then to stop the boat, shove'em in the water, and make them swim while we row back to the palace of their banishment to present the employers with our bills.
F	NATALIE	That was really impressive. You rehearse that?
M	RYAN	I got to grab this. I'll meet you at the rental lot.
M	RYAN	Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.
F	ALEX	I'm in Hotlanta. I need a rib joint recommend bad.
M	RYAN	Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.
F	ALEX	You haven't called.
M	RYAN	You know, I didn't know what was appropriate...
F	ALEX	Ryan, I'm not some waitress you banged in a snow storm. The word "Appropriate" has no place in our collective vocabulary. I'm the woman you don't have to worry about.
M	RYAN	This sounds like a trick.
F	ALEX	Next time you're worried about manners - Don't. If you want to call - Call. Just think of me as yourself... only with a vagina.
M	RYAN	When am I going to see you?
F	ALEX	I'm out of Hartsfield, into IAD, then a connection at ORD into SDF.
M	RYAN	Oh... sorry.
F	ALEX	Tell me about it.
M	RYAN	How long is your layover in O'Hare? They've got multiples into SDF... Think you could push?
F	ALEX	I can push.
M	RYAN	Ryan Bingham, from CTC.
M	RYAN	All you have to do today is watch and listen. When I talk about the strategy packet. You hand them one of these...
F	NATALIE	You ever find it strange that termination comes with a packet.
M	RYAN	Everything important in life comes with a packet.
M	RYAN	Thank you for coming by. As you're probably well aware, this is a tough economic climate and your company is not immune.
M	RYAN	While I wish I was here with better news, the reason you and I are meeting is this is your final week of employment here.
M	RYAN	This is not a time to look for blame. Your position simply no longer exists.
M	RYAN	I understand why you are saying these things. It's perfectly natural to feel this way. I want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet...
M	RYAN	Fill out the skill set work sheet... Use the hopes and dreams diagram... And the tree of aspirations.
M	RYAN	The answers are all in there.
M	RYAN	The answers are all in there. The answers... The answers... ... are-all-in-there.
M	BOB	And what do you suggest I tell them?
F	NATALIE	Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect your career transition may have on your children.
M	BOB	Positive effect?
F	NATALIE	Well, tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a method of coping.
M	BOB	Go fuck yourself. That's what my kids'll think.
M	RYAN	Your children's admiration is important to you?
M	BOB	Yeah. It was.
M	RYAN	Well, I doubt they ever admired you, Bob.
M	BOB	Hey asshole, aren't you here to console me?
M	RYAN	I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake up call. You know why kids love athletes?
M	BOB	Because they screw lingerie models.
M	RYAN	No, that's why we love athletes. Kids love them because they follow their dreams.
M	BOB	Yeah, well I can't dunk.
M	RYAN	But you can cook.
M	BOB	What are you talking about? Ryan picks up Bob's resume.
M	RYAN	Your resume says you minored in French Culinary Arts. Most students work the frier at KFC. You bussed tables at Il Picatorre to support yourself. Then you got out of college and started working here. How much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams?
M	BOB	Twenty seven thousand a year.
M	RYAN	At what point were you going to stop and go back to what made you happy?
M	RYAN	Do you believe in fate, Bob?
M	BOB	Fate?
M	RYAN	Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways in which we wind up doing the things we were meant to do.
M	BOB	I met my wife at a gas station.
M	RYAN	Exactly. Well, I think fate is telling you to do something, Bob.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	I see guys who work for the same company their entire lives. Clock in. Clock out. Never a moment of happiness. Not everyone gets this kind of opportunity.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	The chance for rebirth. If not for yourself... Do it for your kids.
M	BUSINESS WOMAN	I've been waiting ten minutes. He just waltzes in and gets to cut in line.
M	DESK CLERK	We reserve priority assistance for our Hilton Honors members.
M	RYAN	You should look into it - The promotions are great...
M	BUSINESS WOMAN	Fuck off.
M	RYAN	You okay?
F	NATALIE	Yeah. Fine.
F	NATALIE	Hungry, much?
M	RYAN	Our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner. I plan on grabbing every mile I can.
F	NATALIE	Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile business. What's that all about? Are you talking like frequent flier miles?
M	RYAN	Your really want to know?
F	NATALIE	I'm dying to know.
M	RYAN	I don't spend a nickel, if I can help it, unless it somehow profits my mileage account. I'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music downloads, teleflorists. The works. I shop them according to the miles they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value.
F	NATALIE	So, what are you saving up for? Hawaii? South of France?
M	RYAN	No, it's not like that... The miles are the goal.
F	NATALIE	That's it? You're saving to save?
M	RYAN	Let's just say I've got a number in mind and haven't hit it yet.
F	NATALIE	Wow. Seems a little abstract. What's your target?
M	RYAN	I'd rather not.
F	NATALIE	It's a secret target?
M	RYAN	It's ten million miles.
F	NATALIE	Huh. Isn't ten million just a number?
M	RYAN	Pi is just a number.
F	NATALIE	I guess we all need a hobby.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Oh hey, I didn't mean to belittle your collection. I get it. Sounds cool.
M	RYAN	I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon.
F	NATALIE	Do they give you a parade or something?
M	RYAN	Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You get to meet the Chief Pilot, Maynard Finch. And... They put your name on the side of a plane.
F	NATALIE	Men get such a hard-on from putting their name on stuff... You guys don't grow up - You just need to pee on everything.
M	RYAN	Now, who's stereotyping?
M	NANCY	Fear of mortality. It's like Yes, you're going to die one day.
M	RYAN	And why do you suppose that's singular to men?
F	NATALIE	Probably cause you can't have babies.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	If I had that many miles, I'd just show up at the airport, look up at one of those big destination boards, pick a place and go.
M	INTERCUT WITH:	
M	RYAN	Thanks for the advice.
M	RYAN	Man alive.
F	NATALIE	Left, left, left, left... one more inch... and stop.
F	NATALIE	I don't get it.
M	RYAN	My sister is cooky. She thinks this is charming... Like the gnome thing.
F	NATALIE	No, I mean... why would your sister want a fake photo in front of the St. Louis Airport?
M	RYAN	She should be so lucky to visit Lambert Field. The Wright Brothers flew through there... The domed main terminal was the first of its kind. A precursor to everything from JFK to DeGualle.
F	NATALIE	Wow. Pretty sweet.
M	RYAN	Why she wants dozens of reminders of all the places she hasn't been is beyond me.
F	NATALIE	Well, I'm sure she's going to be crushed for having missed this airport.
M	RYAN	Look - Before Lindbergh could cross the Atlantic, he took off from one of those runways... Ever wondered why they call it the Spirit of St. Louis?
F	NATALIE	No.
M	YOUNG ASIAN GUY	... And another thing...? You know how fucked this place is without me? You know how fucked this place is without me? Fucked in the ass, man.
M	YOUNG ASIAN GUY (cont'd)	I am the one thing preventing this place from being totally fucked in the ass.
M	RYAN	Sometimes, they just need to vent.
F	NATALIE	Please, for the love of God, can I fire the next one?
F	KAREN	I'm here to be fired, right?
F	NATALIE	We're here to talk about your future.
F	KAREN	You don't have to sugar coat it. I get the drill. What are they offering?
F	NATALIE	Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.
F	KAREN	Give me the bullet points.
F	NATALIE	Three months pay. Six months medical. A full year of placement services through our company, CTC.
F	KAREN	Placement services? How generous. Commonly, it takes one month of searching for every ten thousand dollars you expect to earn in salary.
F	KAREN	So I could be looking for a while.
F	NATALIE	Not necessarily...
F	KAREN	Oh, don't sweat it. I'm pretty confident about my plans.
F	NATALIE	Oh yeah?
F	KAREN	Yeah. Can you tell me? Is high tide in the morning or the evening?
F	NATALIE	I don't know. Why?
F	KAREN	There's this beautiful bridge by my apartment. I need to figure out what time to jump off it.
M	RYAN	People say these things all the time. It comes with the trade.
F	NATALIE	They do?
M	RYAN	Sure. People are always saying crazy stuff. They get worked up.
F	NATALIE	She was so calm.
M	RYAN	I think that's a good sign.
F	NATALIE	So they don't actually ever do it?
M	RYAN	No... it's just talk.
F	NATALIE	How do you know? Do you follow up?
M	RYAN	I mean, no, nothing good can come of that, but I don't think you should worry about it.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	This is the job. Taking people at their most fragile moment and setting them adrift.
F	NATALIE	I'll be back soon. Not really sure how long this whole exercise is supposed to last. He's fine... It's hard for these guys to accept change, you know. I... I'm not even going to answer that... No, I can't even think of him that way... He's old.
M	RYAN	Okay. This is where it gets a little difficult, but stay with me. You have a new backpack... but this time, I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, people around the office, friends of friends and work your way to the people you trust with your most intimate secrets. Now move into family members - cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get your sisters and your brothers and you parents. Get them all in that backpack. And finally your husband or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend. Get them in their too. A titter through the crowd. For the first time, we see
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Don't worry. I'm not going to ask you to light it on fire.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. Feel the straps cutting into your shoulders. All those negotiations and arguments and secrets and compromises.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Now set that bag down. You don't need to carry all that weight.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Some animals were meant to carry each other. To live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star-crossed lovers. Monogamous swans. We are not one of those animals.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	The slower we move, the faster we die. We are not swans. We're sharks. Meanwhile, down the hall, Natalie is finishing a phone call.
F	NATALIE	Never...?
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	You never want to get married? Never want kids?
M	RYAN	Is that so bizarre?
F	NATALIE	Yes. Yes it is.
M	RYAN	I don't see the value.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Sell it to me.
F	NATALIE	What?
M	RYAN	Sell me marriage.
F	NATALIE	I... Uh... How how about love?
M	RYAN	Pff...
F	NATALIE	Okay. Stability?
M	RYAN	How many stabile marriages do you know?
F	NATALIE	Someone to talk to, spend your life with?
M	RYAN	I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that will change.
F	NATALIE	How about just not dying alone?
M	RYAN	Starting when I was twelve, we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility. My parents went the same way. Make no mistake. We all die alone.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Those cult members down in San Diego with the white sneakers and little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They didn't die alone. Just saying - There's options.
M	RYAN	Oh fuck.
F	NATALIE	Brian left me.
M	RYAN	Oh, hey... I...
M	RYAN	Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie, this is my... friend, Alex.
F	ALEX	I should give you both a moment.
F	NATALIE	No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just stupid emotions.
F	ALEX	Maybe a drink?
F	NATALIE	Now we're talking. He broke up with you over text message?
M	RYAN	That's kind of like firing people over the internet.
F	ALEX	What a weasely prick.
F	NATALIE	Yeah, but what does that make me? Someone who falls for a prick?
F	ALEX	We all fall for them. Pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable, and fun. And then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks.
F	NATALIE	I followed him to Omaha.
M	RYAN	You did?
F	NATALIE	I had a job waiting for me in San Fran, when he got an offer from ConAgra. He told me we could start a life together. So I followed him.
M	RYAN	To Nebraska.
F	NATALIE	I look in the mirror and I just see compromise... I'm supposed to do something.
F	ALEX	You'll do plenty.
F	NATALIE	I just can't... I thought I'd be engaged by now. No offense.
M	ALEX RYAN	It's alright. None taken.
F	NATALIE	When I was sixteen, I thought by twenty three, I would be married, maybe have a kid... Corner office by day, entertaining at night. I was supposed to be driving a Grand Cherokee by now.
F	ALEX	Life can underwhelm you that way.
F	NATALIE	Now I have my sights on twenty nine, because thirty is just way too... apocalyptic. I mean, where did you think you'd be by...
F	ALEX	It doesn't work that way.
M	RYAN	At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.
F	ALEX	They can be a little counterproductive.
F	NATALIE	I don't want to say anything that's... anti-feminist. I mean, I really appreciate everything your generation did for me.
F	ALEX	It was our pleasure.
M	RYAN	Well done.
F	NATALIE	But sometimes it feels like no matter how much success I have, it all won't matter until I find the right guy.
F	ALEX	You really thought this guy was the one.
F	NATALIE	Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I could have made it work. He just really fit the bill.
M	RYAN	The bill?
F	NATALIE	My type. You know, white collar. College grad. Loves dogs. Likes funny movies. Six foot one. Brown hair. Kind eyes. Works in finance but is Outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends. I always imagined he'd have a single syllable name like Matt or John or... Dave. In a perfect world, he drives a Four Runner and the only thing he loves more than me is his golden lab. Oh... and a nice smile. How about you?
M	RYAN	I'm not sure if...
F	NATALIE	I meant Alex...
M	RYAN	Right.
F	ALEX	Huh, let me think for a sec. Well, by the time you're thirty four, all the physical requirements are pretty much out the window. I mean you secretly prey he'll be taller than you.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Not an asshole would be nice? Just someone who enjoys my company. Comes from a good family - You don't think about that when you're younger. Wants kids... Likes kids... Wants kids. Healthy enough to play catch with his future son one day.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Please let him earn more than I do. That doesn't make sense now, but believe me, it will one day. Otherwise it's just a recipe for disaster. Hopefully some hair on his head...? But it's not exactly a deal-breaker anymore. Nice smile... Yep, a nice smile just might do it.
F	NATALIE	Wow. That was depressing.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	I should just date lesbians.
F	ALEX	Tried it. We're no picnic ourselves.
F	NATALIE	I don't mind being married to my career, and I don't expect it to hold me in bed as I fall asleep. I just don't want to settle.
F	ALEX	You're young. Right now you see settling as some sort of failure.
F	NATALIE	It is. By definition.
F	ALEX	Don't worry, by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling... And the only person left to judge you will be the twenty four year old girl with a target on your back.
F	NATALIE	So, what's the plan for this evening?
F	NATALIE	What...? Oh, is it illicit?
M	RYAN	No...
F	ALEX	It's nothing like that.
F	NATALIE	We are in Miami.
M	RYAN	... We were going to hit that party for the tech conference in the hotel.
F	NATALIE	I didn't know you could just attend those...
F	ALEX	Well, I mean...
F	NATALIE	You're going to crash it?
M	RYAN ALEX	I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know These guy put on a quite a what to do with... party...
F	NATALIE	No, I get it. I'm in!
F	ALEX	Jennifer Chu?
F	NATALIE	Oh shit!
M	RYAN	It's going to be fine.
M	RYAN	You okay there?
F	NATALIE	Oh yeah... This was a great idea. You are so pretty. You're exactly what I want to look like in fifteen years.
F	ALEX	Thank you, Natalie.
M	CONFERENCE LEADER	How's everyone doing out there?!
M	CONFERENCE LEADER	I'm going to need you to all put your hands together for a very special guest - YOUNG... M... C!
M	YOUNG MC	THIS HERE'S A TALE FOR ALL THE FELLAS... TRY TO DO WHAT THOSE LADIES TELL US... GET SHOT DOWN CAUSE YOU'RE OVERZEALOUS... PLAY HARD TO GET, FEMALES GET JEALOUS...
M	RYAN	Think she'll be okay?
F	ALEX	Look...
F	ALEX	Back home, I don't get to act the way I do with you.
M	RYAN	That's why I don't have a "back home".
F	ALEX	I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty Back Pack".
M	RYAN	You know about the back pack?
F	ALEX	I googled you.
M	RYAN	You did? It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.
M	RYAN	Did it bother you?
F	ALEX	Well, that depends. Is the bag empty because you hate people or just the baggage they bring along?
M	RYAN	I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.
F	ALEX	You just don't want to be tied down? The whole responsibility thing.
M	RYAN	I don't think it's even that... I... First time I ever flew, I was sixteen.
F	ALEX	You're not going to answer? You're just going to tell me a story?
M	RYAN	It was January and I had just gotten my driver's license. The lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit a soft spot and the hood of my car tilted up and I was sinking backwards into the water.
F	ALEX	Jesus...
M	RYAN	I literally started to drown. Within a few seconds, I black out. Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a helicopter, laying on a stretcher. This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes away from dying.
F	ALEX	Oh my God.
M	RYAN	Right? So just as we're hovering over the hospital, I sit up. And from there, I could see the whole western horizon. We'd been flying twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a city I'd thought of as remote, halfway across the state... a foreign capital. My parents had taught me we lived in the best place on Earth, but now I could see the world was really just one place and comparing didn't make much sense. And I remember thinking - Don't tell me this isn't an age of miracles. Don't tell me we can't be everywhere at once.
M	RYAN	I don't know what originally sparked the back pack. I probably needed to be alone. Recently, I've been thinking that maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in.
M	SOFTWARE DUDE	Hey... I think we're out of gas.
M	RYAN	Hey, you're up...
F	ALEX	Got to fly stand-by and make a meeting in Milwaukee.
M	RYAN	Oh... Okay.
F	ALEX	Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
M	RYAN	Yeah, all right... Just leave the money on the dresser.
F	ALEX	I'll text you later so we can swap schedules.
M	RYAN	I can't remember the last time I enjoyed spending time with someone as much as you.
F	ALEX	Neither can I.
F	NATALIE	Last night got a little out of hand. I said things... I don't remember everything I said. I just didn't want you to think...
M	RYAN	Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose. So, did you wake him up or slip out?
F	NATALIE	What?
M	RYAN	This morning... Your new friend. Did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore.
F	NATALIE	I... just left.
M	RYAN	Protocol is always tricky.
F	NATALIE	I didn't know what was right.
M	RYAN	Sometimes there really is no right thing to do.
F	NATALIE	What happened to Alex?
M	RYAN	Had to skip town early to make a meeting.
F	NATALIE	That's too bad. Where does she live?
M	RYAN	Chicago.
F	NATALIE	You thinking of going to see her?
M	RYAN	I don't know. We just don't have that kind of relationship.
F	NATALIE	What kind of relationship do you have?
M	RYAN	It's, you know. Casual.
F	NATALIE	Sounds pretty special.
M	RYAN	It works for us.
F	NATALIE	Think there's any future there?
M	RYAN	Never thought about it. What's going on here?
F	NATALIE	Really never thought about it?
M	RYAN	No.
F	NATALIE	How can you not think about these things? How does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a future with somebody?
M	RYAN	It's simple, you know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul, and the whole world goes quiet for a second.
F	NATALIE	Yes.
M	RYAN	Right. Well, I don't.
F	NATALIE	You're an asshole.
M	RYAN	Oh come on, I'm just dicking around. I need your help...
F	NATALIE	Don't you think it's worth giving her a chance?
M	RYAN	A chance to what?
F	NATALIE	A chance at something real?
M	RYAN	Natalie, your definition of "real" is going to evolve as you get older...
F	NATALIE	Would you stop condescending for one second? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?
M	RYAN	Bullshit philosophy?
F	NATALIE	The isolation? The traveling? Is that supposed to be charming?
M	RYAN	No, it's simply a life choice.
F	NATALIE	It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
M	RYAN	Wow. Big words.
F	NATALIE	Screw you.
M	RYAN	Well, screw you too.
F	NATALIE	You've set up a way of life that basically makes it impossible for you to make any human connections. Now, somehow, this woman runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous "life choice" and comes out the other end with a smile - Just so you can call her casual. Jesus. I need to grow up? You're a twelve year old.
M	RYAN	I don't have a gauntlet of...
M	RYAN	... Fuck!
M	RYAN	These Detroit guys can be tough. They've been getting hammered. Don't get distracted. Stick to the simple stuff. Get the packet in their hands and get them out the door.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Welcome to Detroit.
M	RYAN	What's going on here?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I've been getting those great numbers over the last few days. Thought we should nut up and give this a try.
M	RYAN	We could use a little more time.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Gotta leave the nest at some point.
M	RYAN	This is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I know. Good thing we brought our best. So let's stop screwing around, alright?
M	RYAN	Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I was thinking Natalie takes this one.
M	RYAN	She's hardly ready for this.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I've been watching her. She's great.
M	RYAN	This is a whole other animal...
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I mean, she created it. Natalie, you not up for it?
F	NATALIE	I'm... I'm game.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Atta girl.
M	RYAN	Just remember, don't apologize. Don't tell them how hard this is for you. Today is one of the worst days they will ever have. What we feel doesn't even compare.
F	NATALIE	Got it.
M	RYAN	Just keep it professional. You're going to do fine.
F	NATALIE	Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is Natalie Keener.
M	SAMUELS	What's going on here?
F	NATALIE	I wish I was here with better news, however your position here at Deckers is no longer available.
M	SAMUELS	What are you talking about?
F	NATALIE	You've been let go.
M	SAMUELS	What, just like that? I can't believe... Who are you?
F	NATALIE	My name is Miss Keener. I am here to tell you about your options...
M	SAMUELS	I work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me? What the fuck is this?!
F	NATALIE	It's perfectly normal to be upset. However, the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you...
M	SAMUELS	Greater opportunities? I'm fifty- seven-fucking years old!
F	NATALIE	Anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	There's a packet in front of you.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	I want you to take some time and review it.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	All the answers you're looking for are inside those pages.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	The sooner you trust the process, the sooner your next step in life will unveil itself. I need you to return to your office now and begin to put together your personal things.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Mr. Samuels? There's nothing else we can discuss now. Thank you for your time.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Mr. Samuels... Mr. Samuels.... MR. SAMUELS...
M	RYAN	You did good. You okay? Want me to take over.
F	NATALIE	No, I'm alright. ... We just got out here. That was one place. I think we need to try a few more... Maybe there isn't a difference, but it's comforting to know we're in the next room. I know you don't give a shit about my comfort. We could just use a little more time. That's all I'm saying. Right... Right. Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye. He thought you did a great job. You did - I was real proud of you.
F	NATALIE	Thanks.
M	RYAN	We're being pulled off the road. We're going home.
F	NATALIE	For good?
M	RYAN	That's what it looks like.
F	NATALIE	I'm sorry about what I said about Alex. I was out of line.
M	RYAN	It's alright. I understand.
F	NATALIE	I mean, who am I to be dolling out relationship advice?
M	RYAN	It's fine.
F	NATALIE	You going to be okay?
M	RYAN	What do you mean?
F	NATALIE	In Omaha?
M	RYAN	Oh, I don't know.
F	NATALIE	It's better than you'd think.
F	NATALIE	Ryan, where are you going?
M	RYAN	Grabbing another flight... Something I need to take care of. I'll see you in, uh... at home.
M	RYAN (O.C.)	Okay, start walking it in from the left.
F	ALEX	I have to admit, when you asked me to meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd gamble, make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird French Canadian circus shows.
M	RYAN	There'll be plenty of time for all that. One more foot to the left.
F	ALEX	How do you feel about the wedding?
M	RYAN	I'm fine, I guess. Okay great... walk away.
F	ALEX	They're a cute couple.
M	RYAN	Think so?
F	ALEX	Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're lucky, maybe look a little like you.
M	RYAN	How do you like Wisconsin in February?
F	ALEX	Who doesn't?
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	I like it if you're there. Besides, I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.
M	RYAN	Northern Wisconsin. What are you doing this weekend?
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	No...
M	RYAN	What? I haven't even...
F	ALEX	I can't.
M	RYAN	Why not?
F	ALEX	I couldn't.
M	RYAN	I'm being serious.
F	ALEX	You want me to be your date?
M	RYAN	Well... Yeah.
F	ALEX	To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your sister's wedding?
M	RYAN	It's not like I know her that well.
F	ALEX	I'm just not sure if it's appropriate for me to...
M	RYAN	Look. You know. I'm not the wedding type. But for the first time in my life... I don't want to be that guy, alone with his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you.
F	ALEX	Okay.
M	RYAN	Really?
F	ALEX	Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah, I'm in. When is it?
M	RYAN	I feel like we should kiss or something.
F	ALEX	Then kiss me.
M	RYAN	Are you available?
M	CHECK-IN LADY	Sorry, this line is for members of our Matterhorn program.
F	KARA	Ryan?
M	RYAN	Kara...
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Alex, this is my sister Kara.
F	KARA	Well, hello.
F	ALEX	Hi.
F	KARA	Ryan has told me nothing about you.
M	RYAN	Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?
F	KARA	Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.
M	RYAN	You're not staying at the house?
F	KARA	There was an extra room on hold here, so I just took it for the weekend.
M	RYAN	Oh, okay.
F	KARA	Yup. So, you guys are dating?
M	RYAN	Um...
F	ALEX	It's not exactly...
F	KARA	Hey, don't worry about it. We're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend... I remember when mom used to call Jack her boyfriend. It drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for kids... And I'm just a divorcee!
M	RYAN	So, the rehearsal dinner?
F	KARA	Yeah, I'll see you two there.
M	RYAN	There's a packet.
F	ALEX	What in life is worth doing that doesn't have a packet.
M	RYAN	Um, I love you?
F	JULIE	Oh my God, Ryan!
M	JULIE (CONT'D)	You must be Alex. You are so beautiful. Kara was right. Did you get the basket?
F	ALEX	The basket was very lovely.
F	JULIE	Tammy wrapped all of them.
M	JULIE (CONT'D)	Ryan, you look so grown up.
M	RYAN	Me? You're the one getting married.
F	JULIE	I know, right? You haven't even seen my ring. Jim designed it.
M	RYAN	I brought those photos you were asking for... Oh great! They go over there.
M	RYAN	There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room.
F	JULIE	I know, isn't it great how everyone chipped in?
M	RYAN	What gave you the idea to do something so...
F	ALEX	... Substantial?
F	JULIE	Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now. So when we went over our finances, a honeymoon just didn't seem affordable this second... So I thought... Hey, just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.
F	ALEX	It was a great idea.
F	JULIE	Thanks. AN HOUR LATER
M	JIM	It's sixty acres up against the foothills. I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself.
M	RYAN	Sounds nice.
M	JIM	Homes will go in the high fours.
M	RYAN	Must be a nice development.
M	JIM	It's a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.
M	RYAN	Nice. We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised.
M	RYAN	That's a nice touch.
M	JIM	What?
M	RYAN	That bit at the end about promise... I like it.
M	JIM	Thanks. So, you still renting that one- bedroom?
M	RYAN	I gave it up.
M	JIM	You own now?
M	RYAN	No.
M	JIM	But you're looking?
M	RYAN	Not really. No.
F	TAMMY	Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How are you going to sleep?
F	JULIE	I don't know!
F	TAMMY	You want some Xanax?
M	RYAN	I don't think that's for sleeping.
F	JULIE	No, I'm good. I'll have some warm milk. That should do the trick.
M	JIM	One more box...
F	ALEX	I'll get it.
M	RYAN	You sure?
F	ALEX	Yeah, yeah...
M	RYAN	Jim seems like a good guy.
F	JULIE	Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?
F	KARA	He's going to make a great husband.
M	RYAN	Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with dad not being... Well, I didn't know if you had someone to walk you down the aisle...
F	JULIE	Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to do it.
F	KARA	He's been really supportive.
M	RYAN	Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to make sure you were covered. So I should get there at...
F	JULIE	Guests are arriving around 5ish. Things get going at 530. So you know, around then. It's easy. Just come down the elevator.
M	RYAN	Hey Kara?
F	KARA	Yeah.
M	RYAN	Can you believe she's getting married already? She's just a kid.
F	KARA	No Ryan. Actually, she's 37 years old. She's barely squeaking by.
M	RYAN	Oh.
F	KARA	Yup. Sleep tight.
F	ALEX	That's all you got?
M	RYAN	Are we really doing this?
F	ALEX	Give me a boost.
M	RYAN	I took geography in here. That was my seat.
F	ALEX	You ever fool around with one of your teachers?
M	RYAN	No. You?
F	ALEX	Not until college. Come on, show me around.
M	RYAN (O.C.)	That's me.
F	ALEX	You played basketball?
M	RYAN	Point guard. Don't act so surprised.
F	ALEX	I didn't know you were such a jock.
M	RYAN	My first fight.
F	ALEX	How'd it go?
M	RYAN	Got my ass kicked.
M	RYAN	This is where we used to go to make out.
F	ALEX	Very romantic.
F	ALEX	I'm really happy I came here.
M	RYAN	Go Cougars!
M	RYAN	It's Kara.
F	KARA	Ryan, where are you? We're having a meltdown here.
M	RYAN	What's wrong? What happened?
F	KARA	It's Jim. Can you get back here? We need your help.
M	RYAN	Yeah, of course...
F	ALEX	I'll grab your suit. Good luck.
M	RYAN	What happened?
F	KARA	Jim's got cold feet.
M	RYAN	Today?
F	KARA	That's how cold feet work.
M	RYAN	What do you want me to do?
F	KARA	Talk to him.
M	RYAN	You want me to talk to him? Hey, it's either you or me. You know my record. I've already struck out once.
M	RYAN	I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout.
F	KARA	Don't you talk for a living? Motivational type stuff?
M	RYAN	I tell people how to avoid commitment.
F	KARA	What kind of fucked up message is that?
M	RYAN	It's a philosophy.
F	KARA	It's stupid.
M	RYAN	Hey, it might have helped you.
F	KARA	Come on, Ryan. You haven't been around much. Fuck, you basically don't exist to us. I know you want to be there for her... Well here it is. This is your chance.
M	JIM	Ryan?
M	RYAN	Oh, hey Jim.
M	JIM	You ever read this?
M	RYAN	Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
M	JIM	I'll say.
M	RYAN	Kara mentioned you were having some... thoughts?
M	JIM	I don't think I can do this.
M	RYAN	Okay. What makes you say that today?
M	JIM	I was just laying there last night in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and all. Us buying a house and moving in together. Having a kid... Having another kid... ... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, football games, all of a sudden they're out of school, getting jobs, getting married, And then, you know... I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before you know it - I'm dead... and I just kept thinking... "What's the point?"
M	JIM (CONT'D)	I mean what is the point?
M	RYAN	The point?
M	JIM	Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?
M	RYAN	It's marriage... it's the most beautiful thing on Earth... you know, what everyone aspires to...
M	JIM	You never got married.
M	RYAN	That's true...
M	JIM	You never even tried.
M	RYAN	Well, it's hard to define "try".
M	JIM	You seem happier than most of my married friends.
M	RYAN	Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage can be a pain in the ass. And you're kind of right - All of this is just stuff on the way to your eventual demise.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	We are all on running clocks that cannot be slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place. Some guys leave marks that last beyond their own mortality. Not guys like you and me... But some. But even those footprints disappear. There isn't a "point".
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	I'm not the guy you'd normally want to talk to about all this stuff... But think about it - your favorite memories. The greatest moments of your life? Were you alone?
M	JIM	No... I guess not.
M	RYAN	I don't want to sound like a Hallmark card, but... Life? It's better with company.
M	RYAN (CONT'D)	Come to think of it... Last night, the night before your wedding, when all this shit was circling through your head... Weren't you two sleeping in separate rooms?
M	JIM	Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I was all alone in that big honeymoon suite...
M	RYAN	Kind of lonely?
M	JIM	Yeah. Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.
M	JIM	That's a nice touch.
M	RYAN	Thanks.
M	JIM	What's the mood like out there?
M	RYAN	It's not good... Emotional.
M	JIM	What should I do?
M	RYAN	Go get her.
M	JIM	I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up... Will you be my co-pilot?
F	KARA	Welcome home.
M	RYAN	Hi, I'm Ryan.
M	WEDDING GUEST	I'm your cousin... Harold.
M	RYAN	Oh, hey!
F	ALEX	When am I going to see you?
M	RYAN	You're just going to have to come and visit.
F	ALEX	So settled down. You're not going to change on me...
M	RYAN	Same guy. Just one address.
F	ALEX	Call me if you get lonely.
M	RYAN	... I'm lonely.
F	NATALIE	... Some guy sits down in a conference room somewhere and a server routes their session to one of our termination engineers.
M	RYAN	You don't actually call them that.
F	NATALIE	I prefer "terminators", but it bumped with legal.
M	RYAN	Really? I can't imagine why.
F	NATALIE	They follow a workflow that can take them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.
M	RYAN	Are they actually on line, right now?
F	NATALIE	No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing. We go live at the end of the month. Kyle, you're running through the events too quickly. You have to give them time to acknowledge each statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.
M	RYAN	This is ridiculous.
M	GOALQUEST HOST	You ready to rock?
M	RYAN	Last year, I flew three hundred fifty thousand miles. The moon is only two fifty.
M	RYAN	Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them?
M	RYAN	Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things.
M	RYAN	The... um... The stuff in drawers and on shelves.
M	RYAN	Excuse me.
M	GOALQUEST HOST	What the fuck are you doing? Okay, everyone just relax. We'll have your next guest out in a sec.
M	RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT	Hey, you forgot to give me your Devotion Club card!
M	RYAN	Surprise.
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)	Honey, who's at the door?
F	ALEX	What are you doing here?
M	ALEX'S HUSBAND	Who was that?
F	ALEX	... just some guy who was lost.
M	RYAN	How could you lie to me?
F	ALEX	What were you thinking - Just showing up at my door like that?
M	RYAN	What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I didn't know you had a family - Why didn't you tell me that?
F	ALEX	Come on, I thought we signed up for the same thing.
M	RYAN	Try to help me understand. What is it you signed up for?
F	ALEX	I thought our relationship was perfectly clear. You're...
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	... an escape.
M	RYAN	I'm an escape?
F	ALEX	You know, a break from our normal lives... A parenthesis.
M	RYAN	I'm a parenthesis?
F	ALEX	Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe we're having this conversation. I mean what do you want? You don't even know what you want. I'm sorry that I ruined your night... But you could have seriously screwed things up for me. That was my family. That's my real life.
M	RYAN	I thought I was a part of your real life.
F	ALEX	Look, Ryan. I'm a grown up. I don't hold a grudge. When you're ready to be an adult and see me again, just give me a call.
M	PLUCKY TICKET AGENT	Welcome back, Mr. Bingham. Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?
M	PLUCKY TICKET AGENT	Of course. Left side aisle, non- bulkhead. Just like you like it.
M	RYAN	What's got you so fucking happy?
M	PLUCKY TICKET AGENT	Your boarding card, Mr. Bingham.
M	PURSER	Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make.
M	PURSER (CONT'D)	Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Mesa... which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit TEN... MILLION... MILES...
M	RYAN	Oh no...
M	MAYNARD FINCH	That seat taken?
M	MAYNARD FINCH	You're the youngest yet to hit twenty mil. Don't know where you found the time... Oh right, here you go.
M	MAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D)	Seventh card we've made. Small club. We really appreciate your loyalty.
M	RYAN	You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here.
M	MAYNARD FINCH	Really? What did you want to say?
M	RYAN	You know, I... I can't remember.
M	MAYNARD FINCH	That's alright. Happens to all of us. So, where you from?
M	RYAN	I'm from here.
M	AIRLINE OPERATOR	Hello, Mr. Bingham.
M	RYAN	Oh, how did you know it was me?
M	AIRLINE OPERATOR	This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers.
M	RYAN	Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller?
M	AIRLINE OPERATOR	Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer?
M	RYAN	How many miles would it take to circle the globe?
M	AIRPORT OPERATOR	We have our "around-the-world" tickets. They're five hundred thousand miles each.
M	RYAN	Sounds perfect.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Got a second?
M	RYAN	I'm going to have to call you right back.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to reach you all day.
M	RYAN	I got tied up in... personal stuff. What's going on?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Do you remember Karen Barnes?
M	Ryan doesn't.	She was part of a thirty person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita. Natalie fired her.
M	RYAN	No, I fire dozens of people a day.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge.
M	RYAN	Fuck.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Yeah. Do you remember anyone giving you any signals of anything? Depression?
M	RYAN	They're all depressed. We're firing them.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Hey, look, you know I have to ask.
M	RYAN	No, I don't remember anything. Of course they're upset. You never think that...
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Wasn't any woman who gave you any indication...? Anything?
M	RYAN	No, nothing that stands out. Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Natalie quit.
M	RYAN	Just like that?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Text message.
M	CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)	Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No one has manners anymore.
M	RYAN	She say where she was going?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	Nah. She was pretty upset.
M	RYAN	I should give her a call.
M	CRAIG GREGORY	I need you back in the air. Did you hear me? I thought you'd be thrilled.
M	RYAN	I'm fine. What about video conferencing?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	CTC is pausing on the whole new media front for a moment. Giving it a little more thought. Getting our work horses back out doing what they do best.
M	RYAN	How long are you sending me out?
M	CRAIG GREGORY	We're going to let you sail and sail. Send us a postcard if you ever get there.
M	MANAGER	So, what happened?
F	NATALIE	How exactly do you mean?
M	MANAGER	You graduated top of your class. You seemed to have your pick of employment... Including right here. Instead, you went to Omaha... to fire people for a living.
F	NATALIE	It's challenging work.
M	MANAGER	I can't imagine doing that day-in- day-out. Not in this climate.
F	NATALIE	... I followed a boy.
M	MANAGER	Everybody does at one point or another.
M	MANAGER	This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	To whom it may concern, I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime. So many, that I've forgotten what it's like to actually hire somebody. We've never met, but I know you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener. My advice? Take her and don't look back. She'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.
M	MANAGER	Hope he's right.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	Tonight, most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids. Their spouses will ask about their day and tonight they'll sleep.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places.
M	RYAN (V.O.)	And one of those lights, slightly brighter than the rest, will be my wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
