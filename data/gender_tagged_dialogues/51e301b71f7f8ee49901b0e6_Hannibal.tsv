M	DRUMGO (cont'd)	Ain't this a picture, though, cause you know you ain't the first girl, ever got lef, in a position, waiting at the doctor's. You can't trust men, child, don't you know that.... old as you are...?

F	STARLING	....where were you...?

M	FBI TYPE	What happened to the girl...?
F	STARLING	Get me out of here...
M	KRENDLER	And you let her get away.
F	STARLING	Sir, with all due respect....
F	CRAWFORD	Just a moment. Starling didn't...
M	KRENDLER	Well, well, well, well, well, she went in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, without the Felon, without the gun...
F	CRAWFORD	I had... one moment, I had an agent in there, waiting for backup from...
M	KRENDLER	...she couldn't act on her own..? Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
F	STARLING	Sir:
F	CRAWFORD	Shut up, Starling...
F	STARLING	I could have acted on my own. I was told...
F	CRAWFORD	Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
F	STARLING	..I was instructed that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
M	KRENDLER	You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
F	STARLING	Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
M	KRENDLER	You were given backup....
F	STARLING	THEN WHERE WAS IT? I'm sent out there... I'm told that the arrest must be a joint...
M	KRENDLER	I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
F	STARLING	And I'm telling you: You wanna throw a Birthday Party: Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's fine, but...
M	KRENDLER	No, I don't get you...
F	STARLING	Due respect, you don't, sir, your precious Joint Operation. FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
M	KRENDLER	Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
F	STARLING	I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition. Evelda Drumgo? I could of took her down in a snap of the fingers-- But-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
M	MAYOR'S REP	The Rainbow Coalition, what is that, excuse me...
M	KRENDLER	And what are you, our Token Woman?
F	STARLING	I don't mind being the token woman, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token man... who are these Warriors, Â¥our cobbled together Strike Force? I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
F	CRAWFORD	Starling...?
F	STARLING	One moment, and they're at the Seven- Eleven. They botched the fallback plan, they...
M	KRENDLER	And, fine, alright, and fine... what are youdoing, this whole time?
F	STARLING	Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force.
F	CRAWFORD	I think that's... Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
M	KRENDLER	And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
F	STARLING	...spend some time on the streets. Ask me then...
M	KRENDLER	Thank you, that's not responsive. How did our Miss Drumgo get...
M	GUIDE	....a compendium of the Bureau's most celebrated cases. Which you have in your Course Study Guide. Now; This afternoon...
F	CRAWFORD	...how'd you let her get that close to you...? ...how'd she get next to you?
F	STARLING	...she gave me her baby.
M	KRENDLER	She threw a punch at a man on the team.
F	CRAWFORD	Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
M	KRENDLER	What is that supposed to mean...?
F	CRAWFORD	I think its meaning is clear.
M	KRENDLER	What, you're saying she was overwrought.
F	CRAWFORD	That could be.
M	KRENDLER	Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
F	CRAWFORD	She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall. And...
M	KRENDLER	One moment, I'm not done with you... Give him the file...
M	AIDE	I thought it was going to go down the line, to....
M	KRENDLER	No, no, no, I want the girl to do it...
M	GUIDE	Of the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter. Here we have a WANTED poster... Offered by an Unnamed Source, Three million Dollars for information leading to the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter. It is, of course, a bounty poster, the only one of its kind, it was never distributed, the contact number was disconnected, and the trail of the person offering the reward was covered so skillfully, that...
M	PAZZI	...would you be so kind...?
F	STARLING	Yeah, sure.
M	GUIDE	....Of the Hannibal Lechter Case. Lechter is, as you know, still at large. Here we see the implements used in his escape from Prison. If you will turn to your course syllabus, Page....
M	PAZZI	....a lovely perfume...
F	STARLING	Glad you like it.
M	GUIDE	HAND, WHICH SHOWS SIX FINGERS, AND AN X-RAY, WHICH, SIMILARLY SHOWS SIX ....of Dr. Lechter's left hand. His left hand, which had a sixth, vestigial, fully formed sixth finger. You would think that a man with a mark so easily identifiable, would... ...and, speaking of the Lechter Case. And, speaking of the Lechter case, I would like to complete our tour of the gallery with three other instances of Criminals Still At Large. To complete our tour, and.... Oh, and to complete your Course of ..Study, by...
M	KRENDLER	Your girl's a menace. Here, givver this... Getter off the street and teach her some humility.
F	CRAWFORD	I don't think so...
M	KRENDLER	Well, then, you have insufficient information. I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight. Yeah, get on to your sea-daddy, Starling. Old as you are... ain't you ashamed, still lookin' for your Pappy...?
F	CRAWFORD	...what has he got against you?
F	STARLING	Why would you say that? Because he sent me in there to be killed...? What is this...?
F	CRAWFORD	...what's he got against you?
F	STARLING	He once made me an improper suggestion.
M	BRIGHAM	Big man, little man... Fair fight, the good Big Man's gonna win. But we don't mean to send you out there to fight fair...
M	BRIGHAM (cont'd)	And, in a gunfight, what just happened to the Big Man? He's at a disadvantage. Inney? Stand up. Big man, now, he's just a bigger target. Let's turn it around. Pull your sidearm. Now, an arrest? You aim to shoot me, or you just playing show and tell. You don't want to shoot me, you just deprived yourself of one of your hands. You fool, I got two hands, you got one. So: what's the gun good for? Force? No. It's good for control. You can control through force, but you can also control through....
M	BRIGHAM (cont'd)	Misdirection.... Misdirection, My Friend. You're pointing a gun at me, looking in the oth'direction, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE...?
M	WOMAN	..that you went into police work to control your rage....
F	STARLING	Well, that would be a poor choice, wouldn't it...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Tell me why...?
F	STARLING	I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Then tell me.
F	STARLING	Well, you know, you know, you know, the point is: I can't tell you. Cause you haven't been there. You haven't done it. And that's all there is.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...and to have done it, means, can mean to accept, not only danger, but betrayal...?
F	STARLING	....that's right.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	..and humiliation? What is this new job they've...?
F	STARLING	No. That's right. That's all part of it.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Then, that being so, why is today special? Why have you come back to see me? Is it that new file they gave you?
F	STARLING	I don't think so.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Then what brings you back?
F	STARLING	I don't know. Do you know...?
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Yes. I think I do. I think it is a phrase you used with that woman. You told her you were an orphan. You used, to your mind, your most private fears.
F	STARLING	...no...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...you called up memories of your father to...
F	STARLING	...no...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...barter with her. To appeal to her, and you feel that...
F	STARLING	No, I don't think so...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	It is you who have betrayed...
F	STARLING	...no.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Your father. It is not they, who...
F	STARLING	Well, no... That's... I appreciate your help, but...
M	MAPP	You want another drink, honey...?
F	STARLING	I want the same drink. Cause it did me good... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another. B'cause it's one of the few things, in the world, which are effective an'predictable.
M	MAPP	What's that, Baby?
F	STARLING	Alcohol. Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities... ...not unlike some Hindu God...
M	MAPP	I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
F	STARLING	Well. Excellent... I'm...
M	FOREIGN COP	Semper Fi.
M	BRIGHAM	...truer words were never spoken...
F	STARLING	Our Mister Frendler to, to, to humiliate me, though....
M	MAPP	What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
F	STARLING	Oh baby, oh baby....
M	BRIGHAM	Bad beat today.
F	STARLING	Hey, I'm fine. Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
M	MAPP	Look what they put her on...
F	STARLING	No, that is code-word material, that's what that is....
M	MAPP	They got her cleaning out the privvies.
M	BRIGHAM	What does this mean?
M	MAPP	Slap her wrist, they got her, chasing down the auction houses, drawings of Mr.Lechter, come up for sale.
M	BRIGHAM	Why's she chasing'em down...?
M	MAPP	Find out: is he selling'em, he needs the money, o'r'izzey buying them, f'Old Times sake...
M	BRIGHAM	That's weak. The man's long gone, he's not coming back, buy up a drawing...
F	STARLING	No, but that is the Will of the Institution. To instill a proper Probity, Humility, deference, in the prideful Individual.....COULD I, DOES ANYONE THINK, HAVE ANOTHER BEER...?
M	JIM	This Jackal Krendler, trine a shame her, cause they botched the raid.
M	BRIGHAM	Evelda Drumgo.
F	STARLING	COULD I GET A DRINK, N'I don't care, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' makework, than be doin' pub'l'relations with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one Hispanic, one Librarian, one Jew, and One from Column A, and One from Column... Thank you.
M	PAZZI	An Honor. Carlo Pazzi....
F	STARLING	No, y'know, I never doubted it...
M	PAZZI	You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
F	STARLING	Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
M	MAPP	You should get Married.
F	STARLING	That's what I should do. Tell me why?
M	MAPP	Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
F	STARLING	Yeah, but who would marry friendless me... Howabout you, Romeo...?
M	PAZZI	...sadly...
F	STARLING	Hey, lost again.
M	PAZZI	But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
F	STARLING	I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would kill you.
M	PAZZI	His feelings do him honor. And I have come, simply, to pay my respects to the great Clarice Starling...
F	STARLING	The great and beautiful...
M	PAZZI	Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
F	STARLING	No,I get it, this is my Cavalier. This gents my Italian Knight. Take this... For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
M	PAZZI	Thank you.
F	STARLING	Or clear your windshield with it.
M	PAZZI	...what a lovely perfume.
F	STARLING	Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin home, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to take her there...
M	BRIGHAM	C'mon, pal. All y'got to do is ask...
F	STARLING	...this one is my favorite. It has not title. They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
M	PAZZI	I know it well.
F	STARLING	Do you. What does that mean?
M	PAZZI	It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
M	MAPP	Yeah, we got all sort of "funeray Sculpture," here, I guess they mean statues in Graveyards. Brazil, the Tomb of Karl Marx, London, Here's one in Scandinavia...
M	PAZZI	Florence, as you may not know, is famed for...
F	STARLING	Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
M	PAZZI	...but: this particular statue...
F	STARLING	Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
M	PAZZI	....this is perhaps an inappropriate time... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who solved the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
F	STARLING	I din't solve it, I didn't 'solve it'. I just sat a dance out with him. Facts, facts, facts. Facts, close the case, cavalier.
M	PAZZI	...a case, so, so fascinating, so...
M	BRIGHAM	It was all of that, SON...
M	PAZZI	..what makes a man ... what makes him... Eat Human Flesh...?
F	STARLING	Yeah, well, they solved that: turns out, he'uz a cannibal...
M	MAPP	Show'm the FBI Handshake...
F	STARLING	I am no going to show you the secret handshake!
M	BRIGHAM	C'mon, pal, I'm gone to buy you a drink...
M	MAPP	Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the trick is...?
F	STARLING	...not to turn around.
M	BRIGHAM	You want to get married...?
F	STARLING	You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
M	BRIGHAM	You're ready now.
F	STARLING	I'm not.
M	BRIGHAM	That's what you think...
F	STARLING	...mos kind... Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm shooting at shadows...
M	BRIGHAM	Is that what you're afraid of...?
F	STARLING	Then you tell me, then.
M	BRIGHAM	You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
F	STARLING	I feel... I feel they're Out to Get Me...
M	BRIGHAM	And who is "they?"
F	STARLING	...they're sending me. Out to get Shot. Hounding me.... they're... ...the whole world's out to get you...
F	STARLING	How crazy is that.
M	BRIGHAM	Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a big target...
F	STARLING	How crazy is that....
F	STARLING	Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see Mason Verger.
M	CORDELL	Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
F	STARLING	The children...?
M	CORDELL	...they're from Baltimore....
F	STARLING	I've never heard that he...
M	CORDELL	It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am. It's just something he does.
F	STARLING	I won't take much of his time.
M	CORDELL	He's glad to help. ...it's just a question of his physical condition. You Understand... ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...?
M	NURSE	Five minutes...
M	VERGER	Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt. And what will make it better? Love. Isn't that odd. He think's he's hurt his knee--but the assurance, the assurance, the assurance Suggests the hurt was elsewhere.
F	STARLING	Mr. Verger, thank you for your time.
M	VERGER	For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
F	STARLING	I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
M	VERGER	Ah, yes, ah yes. Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to capture him? How terrible for you...
F	STARLING	No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
M	VERGER	Because we must leave the past in the Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
M	VERGER (cont'd)	No, no. That's alright. Yes. Lechter's drawings of me. Before... and, of course, after... Now: you are not sent to pursue him. Then your visit baffles me.
F	STARLING	Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction. Several large reserve bids have been placed on them. I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
M	VERGER	Because?
F	STARLING	Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
M	VERGER	And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
F	STARLING	Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources.
M	VERGER	Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
F	STARLING	Due respect, sir... Due respect, after your, after your...
M	VERGER	My encounter.
F	STARLING	Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
M	VERGER	Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true. I offered the bounty. It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder. Do you (WHEEZE) Agent Starling: do you know God? ...sir...?
M	VERGER	Isn't it funny? You can look on my face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows (WHEEZE) a Strength which must come from strong But you shy when I say the name of God.
M	NURSE	...I'm sorry..
F	STARLING	Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings.
M	VERGER	I have not, I would not. For life (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling. And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm... (WHEEZE) (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment. I was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter. I was afflicted before. Before. Do you see? In my arrogance. Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when you are humiliated. Listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life.... Listen, and you hear the word of God...
F	STARLING	...will he be alright...?
M	CORDELL	Mr. Verger wanted me to give you this...
M	CORDELL (cont'd)	And he has asked me to ask you something.
F	STARLING	What would that be?
M	CORDELL	He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation. To a charitable institution of your choice.
F	STARLING	Now, why in the world would he do that?
M	CORDELL	I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction. To his appearance.
F	STARLING	What reaction?
M	CORDELL	Exactly.
F	STARLING	Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him. But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
M	CORDELL	Do you know the seller?
F	STARLING	We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
M	CORDELL	Try Barney Clark.
F	STARLING	He is...?
M	CORDELL	He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
F	STARLING	And how would you know that?
M	CORDELL	Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
F	STARLING	You should get the kids a dog...
M	CORDELL	....I hardly think so... after "The Incident"...
F	STARLING	No, no, of course not.
M	CORDELL	...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
F	STARLING	Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...that you could ~go beyond the institution."
F	STARLING	Yes.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	What does that mean?
F	STARLING	I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Yes, so you said. But what does that mean: to go beyond The Institution.
F	STARLING	If he could overcome... his need for... for self-ratification...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...would you use a small word?
F	STARLING	For approval.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	What's wrong with approval? You admired that man.
F	STARLING	Yes.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	How do you think that made him feel? What does that mean, "to go beyond the institution...?"
F	STARLING	I told that woman I'm an orphan.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...you are an orphan.
F	STARLING	But... but....but.... you're right. I used it. To bargain. For her sympathy... I used it--to "whore myself out"--
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Welcome to the human race. Do you know, there are people who admire you? Reasonable people. Why don't you find them...?
F	STARLING	Y'see John Brigham...?
M	AIDE	...I...
F	CRAWFORD	Look at this:

F	STARLING	Am I on that case, sir...?
F	CRAWFORD	No.
F	STARLING	Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a hobbyist...
M	AIDE	Agent Brigham is in the Library.
F	STARLING	Excuse me...
M	BRIGHAM	This isn't signed.
F	STARLING	Hard up as you are, at your age? Whadda you care? Surrender.
M	BRIGHAM	~Don't shoot, G-Men..." Why?

TIGHT TWO ...a monster fed his face to the dogs. N'he said that it saved his life. He's spend'n his life helping Children. How corny is that...? But, you know what: I give up. Let's get married and spoil a buncha Kids...
M	AGENT	Starling: They got a x-ray. They think, they might have a lead on Lechter.
F	STARLING	Wherever he is, that's fine with me...
M	AGENT	They...
F	STARLING	Yeah, I know.
M	AGENT	They got a Radiologist Assistant, Buenos Aires, guy, amputation of a Sixth Finger...and it seems to've left a scar, uh oh....

M	PAZZI	They're offering...
M	ANNA	...you haven't found him yet.
M	PAZZI	What is this, a whorehouse, or are you my wife?
M	ANNA	You've gone off to America, on your Vacation...
M	PAZZI	...I was working...
M	ANNA	...please...
M	PAZZI	I swear to you...
M	ANNA	...and I want to talk to you about your promotion..
M	PAZZI	Yes? My promotion...?
M	ANNA	I want to talk to you about your salary. Because I can't... I need you, y'understand, I need you...
M	ANNA	...everybody needs something...
M	PAZZI	Hold up a minute...
M	COP ONE	You spend the afternoon in Bed?
M	PAZZI	First things first.
M	COP ONE	You take this much time over everything?
M	PAZZI	That's why my wife adores me.
M	COP ONE	Carlo Fanelli, Dottore, missing two months. He was the Director of the Museum. Which, since his absence...
M	RICCI	Ah, Pazzi. How was America...? We may need you to stop bloodshed.
M	PAZZI	What're they on about?
M	RICCI	They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
M	PAZZI	Speaking of the Vacant Post.
M	RICCI	Dottore Fanelli...
M	COP	He hasn't, by any chance, wandered back in?
M	SOGLIATO	Now: our applicant holds in his hand, in his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from Dante Aligheri himself. Would he recognize it, I think not...
M	ANOTHER OLD MAN	You want the job for your nephew.
M	SOGLIATO	Indeed I do. Because he is my Nephew? No. Because he....
M	A THIRD OLD MAN	Let him read the note...
M	SOGLIATO	Yes, fine, of course he can read the note. His Italian is admirable, for a straniero. But is he familiar with... The personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence? I think not.
M	RICCI	...a Dr. Fell. A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
M	PAZZI	Brazilian.
M	RICCI	It would seem.
M	SOGLIATO	What if he came upon a note in, the Capponi Library, this great Italian Institution, which he now graces us with his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de Cavalcanti. Would he recognize it, I think not. Would you care to address that, Dr. Fell...?
M	DR. FELL	Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet. Do you know it, Professor Sogliato? I believe it's worth your time: Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia-- the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo. If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers....
M	SOGLIATO	...why do you want this job?
M	DR. FELL	In the hope, that someday, I should come across such a note. I thank you gentleman for your kind attention, and hope you will consider...
M	RICCI	...investigating the disappearance of Dottore Fanelli...
M	PAZZI	Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that...
M	COMMITTEE MEMBER	...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
M	PAZZI	...he was wealthy...
M	COMMITTEE MEMBER	He had nothing. He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
M	PAZZI	...his family has offered a large reward.
M	COMMITTEE MEMBER	His older brother offers the reward, Fanelli had nothing, he....
M	COMMITTEE MEMBER (cont'd)	...will have, of course to be examined by the Studiolo, to confirm the appointment, but I think I can assure you, that the Committee...
M	DR. FELL	...you are most kind...
M	COMMITTEE MEMBER	..who would benefit from his disappearance? No one. No one has but lost by it...
M	PAZZI	...would you excuse me...?
M	RICCI	...will have to face the Studiolo, in their meeting next week. And I, for one, wish you the best.
M	PAZZI	Dottore... Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore, Prefatura...
M	FELL	Of course, Commendatore...
M	PAZZI	Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
M	FELL	I never met him. I knew him only from his writings.
M	PAZZI	I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note...
M	FELL	...yes.
M	PAZZI	You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
M	FELL	It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
M	PAZZI	Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
M	FELL	Yes. Packed and with an inventory.
M	PAZZI	I'll have them picked up. May we drop you?
M	FELL	Thank you, I am most happy to walk in this most magnificent of cities.
M	PAZZI	May I ask you a personal question, Dr. Fell?
M	FELL	If your duty requires it.
M	PAZZI	You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
M	FELL	And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La Vita Nuova?--
M	PAZZI	You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
M	FELL	Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard? Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
M	PAZZI	Why did you look at me that way?
M	FELL	I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean. Just dressed--in the middle of the...
M	PAZZI	...please...
M	FELL	I saw a man, somewhat fatigued. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled. In the middle of the day. An old story. And then I saw the clothing was fresh--therefore: a man who dressed at home. And then I remarked the new wedding ring. And so: the story gave me pause. A lovely story. A new, and a beloved wife. I wish you joy.
M	PAZZI	You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
M	FELL	I'm a historian. It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
M	PAZZI	...your scar..?
M	FELL	My scar is a war-wound.
M	PAZZI	How so?
M	FELL	Carpal-tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing. Commendatore. History, a hazardous profession. You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you not?
M	PAZZI	Yes. How did you know?
M	FELL	You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
M	PAZZI	It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist. You have seen the chapel?
M	FELL	I have had the honor. I wondered that an officer of your exalted rank should come, so late, into the case.
M	PAZZI	And? Then?
M	FELL	I wonder no longer. You were out of the country.
M	PAZZI	How could you know?
M	FELL	I sense... The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose base is "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such a clean scent. No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World. I would say, you have been in America. Have I struck home?
M	PAZZI	You know America?
M	FELL	...you have brought this perfume... brought this perfume. Back. Back from America. To your New Wife... You have given it to her, and some of... Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you. Lucky man. Lucky man, indeed.
M	PAZZI	Should you come across anything which...
M	FELL	You will be the first I call.
M	BARNEY	Are you attracted by Death? It is the one great mystery, is it not? Anyone who would say otherwise must be a hypocrite. Don't you think...?
M	BARNEY (cont'd)	...or are you only attracted by power... How are you, Agent Starling?
F	STARLING	Ah, Barney: you've got a good mernory.
M	BARNEY	You know why that is? Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
F	STARLING	I have not read you your rights.
M	BARNEY	Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
F	STARLING	I hereby acknowledge that...
M	BARNEY	And now I have "dociled" you, have I not? By forcing your obedience.
F	STARLING	Then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
M	BARNEY	To show... in my ability to squander. What one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours...
F	STARLING	Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...?
M	BARNEY	If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
M	BARNEY	You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.
F	STARLING	Well. Word gets around.
M	BARNEY	...what hindered you...?
F	STARLING	It wasn't my day.
M	BARNEY	Perhaps you did not have the support you required.
F	STARLING	It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
M	BARNEY	Or, perhaps...
F	STARLING	...how are things at the Hospital?
M	BARNEY	It's a growth business.
F	STARLING	What have they got you doing?
M	BARNEY	Orderly.
F	STARLING	I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
M	BARNEY	I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
F	STARLING	You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
M	BARNEY	Yes, I presumed it was about him.
F	STARLING	...you...
M	BARNEY	I'm struck by your phraseology. I did not last with him. I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
F	STARLING	I'm looking for...
M	BARNEY	He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil.
F	STARLING	Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
M	BARNEY	He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or: "natural composting." Do you think he'd come after you...?
F	STARLING	What...?
M	BARNEY	I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter. As the Soul of Man. Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
F	STARLING	We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books.
M	BARNEY	Yes?
F	STARLING	And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
M	BARNEY	Why me?
F	STARLING	Waal, because your selling'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz. P.A.N.Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
M	BARNEY	...very good.
F	STARLING	Here's what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
M	BARNEY	...why?
F	STARLING	Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
M	BARNEY	You said "here's what they want you to do..." Why?
F	STARLING	Now, whyn't you help us?
M	BARNEY	That would adversely impact my income.
F	STARLING	Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
M	BARNEY	We could skip the Gavotte.
F	STARLING	Say it in English.
M	BARNEY	Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
F	STARLING	Then who's buying it?
M	BARNEY	There's one or two freaks, and, for a "Pass," I'll rat them out to you...
F	STARLING	That's the spirit...
M	BARNEY	...aren't you afraid of me...?
F	STARLING	You want me to be?
M	BARNEY	I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise.
F	STARLING	A vacant exercise, why...?
M	BARNEY	You said "here's what they want you to do." Aren't you part of them anymore...? Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or what? Have you transgressed...?
F	STARLING	Let's keep it to business, shall we?
M	BARNEY	...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
F	STARLING	...they did it for a lark.
M	BARNEY	Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif... Off you go. You've grieved enough. Anything more would be self-indulgence.
F	STARLING	Who are these guys...?
M	BARNEY	Rich, comic book freaks.
F	STARLING	And why is it a vacant exercise?
M	BARNEY	Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
F	STARLING	Who would that be.
M	BARNEY	Mason Verger. For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. Can you be free....?
F	STARLING	No, you're wrong about Verger.
M	BARNEY	Oh, yes. He's found Peace.
F	STARLING	Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
M	BARNEY	And have you found Peace..?
F	STARLING	What'll you do with the bird...?
M	BARNEY	Pluck it, and eat it. It was so good to see you..
M	BRIGHAM	How you doin?
F	STARLING	M'I gonna see you tonight?
M	BRIGHAM	That's right.
F	STARLING	Then I'm doing fine.
M	BRIGHAM	What's new onna street?
F	STARLING	All Quiet Along the Potomac... Can we run this guy down?
M	TECHNICIAN	Who is he?
F	STARLING	His job description? He's a comic book freak.
M	TECHNICIAN	Whadda we want him for...?
F	STARLING	Insufficient Animation. Just get me his vital signs, will you...? Catcha later...
M	TECHNICIAN	Which would, of necessity, have left this scar in the shape of the number "3."
F	CRAWFORD	Why a Three?
M	TECHNICIAN	It requires two flaps to close the area between the...
F	CRAWFORD	Starling: come look at this: did you see this?
F	STARLING	Yes sir, I saw it.
F	CRAWFORD	We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
F	STARLING	I am all attention.
F	CRAWFORD	He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
F	STARLING	Just the person I'm looking for.
M	MAPP	And why would that be...?
F	STARLING	Because you're going to help me plan a party.
M	MAPP	You're going to do that?
F	STARLING	I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
M	MAPP	The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force: read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo. The man's hazing you.
F	STARLING	My daddy would say: accept with glee the things you cannot change.
M	MAPP	I'll tell you what: I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota.
F	STARLING	Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery. Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
M	MAPP	Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
F	STARLING	Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
M	MAPP	You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step slow...
F	STARLING	I don't wanna go out there at all...
M	MAPP	What do you want to do? You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
F	STARLING	No. I want to buy a dog.
M	MAPP	What broke you free, Girl?
F	STARLING	I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
M	CORDELL	"...and age-appropriate large and small motor skills. His unfortunate home situation has made it necessary for Franklin to form immediate attachments with adults, which we understand to have contributed to many instances of his abuse."
M	VERGER	Are you Franklin ?
M	FRANKLIN	...Franklin.
M	VERGER	Where do you live?
M	FRANKLIN	With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean. But Stringbean, he in and out.
M	VERGER	In and out. Yes. And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
M	FRANKLIN	She my foster.
M	VERGER	She's not the first foster that you've had. Is she?
M	FRANKLIN	No.
M	VERGER	Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
M	FRANKLIN	We got KittyKat...
M	VERGER	Yes.... yes...
M	FRANKLIN	...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
M	VERGER	Yes. Franklin, you can't live there anymore. With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat. You have to go away.
M	FRANKLIN	...who say...?
M	VERGER	The government says. Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home. You can't see Mama anymore. Or Shirley. Or Kitty Cat. That's what the Government says... ...or perhaps they just don't want you anymore. Could that be? And, do you know what will happen to Kitty Cat? When you go away. The police will take her, and they'll give her a shot. With a shiny needle. They'll give Kitty Cat a shot. And it will hurt her. And then she will die. Come here... FACE SCREWING UP IN TERROR AS THE DETAIL OF VERGER BECOME MORE APPARENT. HE STOPS Do you know how you keep kittycat from getting a shot? Franklin? No? Do you know. Then come here... You can keep Kitty Cat from getting a shot if... If you give him this... You can keep her from getting the shot, if you give her that rat poison yourself... Goodbye, Franklin. ...remember what we talked about. No, I'm fine... ..what have we heard from our friend at the FBI...?
M	CORDELL	Most current information shows the result of an operation for the removal of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man.
M	VERGER	Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
M	CORDELL	Not with any certainty we...
M	VERGER	Why did he come back?
M	CORDELL	Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
M	VERGER	...WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
M	CORDELL	...are you alright, sir...?
M	VERGER	HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before.
M	CORDELL	Seen what, sir..?
M	VERGER	The puppy comes back. If you lie on the ground. The Puppy with return. Why? Do you know why...? TO KILL YOU. IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK. As Lechter will return back. You see? To the sight of his oppressor wounded. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling. Bring me a drink.
M	CORDELL	Your drink, sir.
M	VERGER	It's time to step up the pressure on our Sweet Miss Starling. ...call our friend at the F.B.I. And, instead of finding Lechter, let's help Him find us.
M	PAZZI	...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...
M	MRS. PAZZI	They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
M	PAZZI	Fine, thank you, but
M	MRS. PAZZI	Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
M	PAZZI	...whatever is within my power... ...and that is what you need to expand.
M	PAZZI	I don't understand.
M	MRS. PAZZI	We are here on sufferance. I am here...
M	PAZZI	...why are we here in the first place...?
M	MRS. PAZZI	Because it is exclusive... because everyone will be here... Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you... You see, that is my point.
M	PAZZI	...my love...
M	MRS. PAZZI	...they asked us to dinner. How can we accept if we cannot return the...
M	PAZZI	I am on the track of...
M	MRS. PAZZI	Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, if you get it, will not buy me a new watch...
M	PAZZI	...what do you expect me to...
M	MRS. PAZZI	So, the question: as always, Rinaldo, the question is one of mmm...
M	FELL	Commendatore would you do me the honor of introducing me.
M	PAZZI	Darling, Dr. Fell. My wife Madame Pazzi. Enchante.
M	GUIDE	The exhibit is closing. The exhibit is closing in Ten Minutes... please make your way to the...
M	MRS. PAZZI	Dr. Fell. You are not Italian.
M	FELL	Sadly, no. And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
M	MRS. PAZZI	And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
M	PAZZI	Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
M	FELL	Indeed I am. And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
M	PAZZI	But the exhibit is closing.
M	FELL	How unfortunate.
M	FELL (cont'd)	May I...?
M	FELL (cont'd)	What a lovely perfume. I believe I recognize it, do I not...?
M	MRS. PAZZI	My husband brought it to me from America.
M	FELL	A wonderful country...
M	MRS. PAZZI	You know it?
M	FELL	I have had many excellent meals there.
M	MRS. PAZZI	And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
M	FELL	...should love to correct your error. Well, perhaps sometime we...
M	PAZZI	Darling...
M	FELL	Well, if you will excuse me. Madame. What a pleasure.
M	PAZZI	The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
M	PAZZI	No. Invite us? No, he simply...
M	MRS. PAZZI	Then we cannot go.
M	PAZZI	Because...?
M	MRS. PAZZI	Because we cannot pay...
M	MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)	...constant humiliation. And why?
M	PAZZI	"Because we don't have any money."
M	MRS. PAZZI	....because we don't have any mmm...
M	PAZZI	The Case that I am working on...
M	MRS. PAZZI	It's a joke. You're a joke. You're a joke. You don't know what money is-- your idea of money... ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.' That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
M	MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)	And if you do not find some money. Soon. I'm leaving you. And I want tickets to the Opera.
M	MAPP	What was it. What was it, honey?
F	STARLING	...something about my father...?
M	MAPP	...what?
F	STARLING	Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
M	VERGER	Show me the pigs.
M	VERGER (cont'd)	Good morning, Gentlemen.
M	CORDELL	...may we see it, please?
M	GENTLEMAN	We have them trained the two things: to come on the whistle, and to attack the figurine.
M	GENTLEMAN (cont'd)	...can you see the pig...?
M	GENTLEMAN (cont'd)	We stuff the figure with mean scraps, at first, of course, the pigs is...
M	VERGER	Do it...
M	CORDELL	...Let's see the pigs, please.
M	GENTLEMAN	We tape the screams, to get them used to the
M	SECOND GENTLEMAN	...distraction.
M	GENTLEMAN	...as you recommend, I think they like it. They will eventually.
M	VERGER	Make them eat the figurine.
M	GENTLEMAN	They will, sir. We train them, to the figurine, eventually, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
M	VERGER	...tell them...
M	CORDELL	We don't want the man consumed. No. We want to put the man's feet through the bars, and have the pigs... and have the pigs eat his feet.
M	GENTLEMAN	...they eat his feet...
M	VERGER	Yes. It's all a question of bait--isn't it...?
M	VERGER (cont'd)	...make them eat the dummy.
M	GENTLEMAN	...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the man... I keep them hungry. When... when do we think this man arrives.
M	VERGER	Is it necessary to know?
M	GENTLEMAN	Well, I don't want to starve them too long. They die.
M	VERGER	Oh, no, no. It won't be that long. No, I don't think it will be too very long at all. Please call our friend at the FBI. Hello. Do you know who this is? I think it's time to finish the preparation of our friend. Miss Starling. I'm fine, how are you...?
F	STARLING	...to, to... to be in control of my... my emotions.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions. that's all we have time for today...
F	STARLING	I don't understand.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	You said: that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside. And get on with your job.
F	STARLING	That's right.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
F	STARLING	Yes.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	And you've decided to get married. You've decided a lot of things. But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of: despair, of failure of... you still have the nightmare, you...
F	STARLING	What is your point?
M	PSYCHIATRIST	That if decision were a useful tool, you wouldn't be here. Why are you here...?
F	STARLING	I..
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...yes...?
F	STARLING	I want to do something positive...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	You want some advice.
F	STARLING	Yes.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Your life has been defined by institutions. The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau. If the Institution is your life, accept it. Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force. Play their game.
F	STARLING	...why?
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
M	PAZZI	...a liaison position...
M	SUPERIOR	And what does that mean?
M	PAZZI	...I feel that...
M	SUPERIOR	"A liaison position with the Opera." Rinaldo, what happened to you? You want me to reach out for tickets to the Opera. Say so. What is that young girl doing to you...?
M	PAZZI	Could you get me tickets to the Opera.
M	SUPERIOR	She must be something special After Dark.
M	PAZZI	I can't remember. I've got to make some money.
M	SUPERIOR	Thirty thousand dollars reward. In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
M	PAZZI	...yes, yes, yes....
M	PAZZI (cont'd)	Could you help me with tickets to..
M	SUPERIOR	The short term problem is the tickets-- The long-term problem is your wife.
M	COLLEAGUE	Naldo, you want Opera Tickets...?
M	PAZZI	Can you help me?
M	COLLEAGUE	No, but I'm going. If you like, I'll tell you what you missed.
M	SUPERIOR	And the related problem is your job. Aha. And here it all comes together. To get a promotion you must keep your job. To keep your job you must solve this case. Solve the case, and the reward may help you keep your wife. In short, the solution to all your problems lies in This File: The Disappearance of Il Dottore Fanelli. ....identified by the following: acute anesthesia or a hper- ...phenomenal capacity for languages. Known perfect fluency ...notable in all scenes of abduction: 1) The condiments
M	ANGLE THE REPORT	...of indeterminate sexuality. But remarkably attractive to
M	COLLEAGUE	Commendatore, if you're looking for Opera Tickets....
M	PAZZI	Hello....?
M	VOICE ON PHONE	...what did you want?
M	PAZZI	I know where he is.
M	VOICE ON PHONE	I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
M	PAZZI	I know where he is.
M	VOICE ON PHONE	And why should we believe you?
M	PAZZI	I know something no one knows. He has had his finger removed. On his left hand. It left a scar.
M	VOICE ON PHONE	What shape is the scar?
M	PAZZI	I want the money.
M	VOICE ON PHONE	What shape is the scar?
M	PAZZI	The shape of a Three.
M	CORDELL	...on positive identification. And the remainder of the Reward, upon his apprehension by the appropriate Legal Authorities.
M	VERGER	Where was the call from.
M	CORDELL	Somewhere in Italy.
M	VERGER	Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
M	CORDELL	...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
M	VERGER	That operation has begun. Are we God, that we would Meddle with it...? No, on the other hand...
M	OPERAGOER	How can she sleep at a time like this? How can she...
M	COP	...sleep at a time like this...?
M	BRIGHAM	She's resting. She's conserving her strength, perhaps you should do the same.

M	VERGER	...you forgot to cancel the plan.
M	CORDELL	...sir...?
M	VERGER	Waal, Nobody's Perfect... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
M	BANKER	One hundred thousand dollars, Signori. The remainder of the three million. Upon the person-in-question's apprehension. Would you prefer a cheque...?
M	PAZZI	No, no thank you, I...
M	PAZZI (cont'd)	...and the Remainder, you said. ..?
M	BANKER	After you have, in the words of our friends, the Americans, Put him On the Spot.
M	PAZZI	But is that necessary...
M	BANKER	It is necessary, if you wish the remainder of the money. Shall we drive you to the airport...?
M	PAZZI	I...I thought I'd do some shopping...
M	MRS. PAZZI	...how can I thank you?
M	PAZZI	Ask me when we get home.
M	MRS. PAZZI	Oh, my program...
M	FELL	Ah, Commendatore... you, too, admire Mozart.
M	PAZZI	Who does not?
M	FELL	If such there breathe, I'm sure you could unearth him... Your reputation does you honor.
M	PAZZI	I've left my program...
M	FELL	Take mine. Ah. And is that your wife... Signora. Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
M	MRS. PAZZI	My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
M	FELL	Then, she, herself, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
M	FELL (cont'd)	Commendatore, your wife tells me you are taking her away on Vacation.
M	PAZZI	...long overdue.
M	FELL	MANY CARS AND LIMOS, PULLING Back to America...? When first we met you'd just returned from America.
M	MRS. PAZZI	How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your busy mind...
M	FELL	...how so?
M	MRS. PAZZI	...you told me you were studying for your examination by the Studiolo...
M	FELL	And how good of you to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to America...
M	MRS. PAZZI	No, this is pleasure...
M	FELL	And what was the trip before...?
M	MRS. PAZZI	That, that was business...
M	FELL	Business. Yes. How much better. To travel for the Pure Enjoyment of the thing, of the variety of the world....yes... Just to Get Away. I'm surprised they can spare you, in the midst of your investigation. of the disappearance of my predecessor...
M	MRS. PAZZI	Take me home and make love to me...
M	MAN'S VOICE	Time to get something to eat...
M	FELL	Yes, quite...
M	MAN	I beg your pardon.
M	FELL	You suggested it was time to get something good to eat.
M	MAN	I thought that you were... Ah! Where shall we eat...?
M	FELL	...where shall we eat. And what shall we eat.
M	PAZZI	...Laura...Laura...Laura...
M	MRS. PAZZI	...and then, we're going to Greece...
M	PAZZI	Yes, but the important thing, as I've said...
M	MRS. PAZZI	...get me a cigarette.
M	PAZZI	The essential thing. The essential thing, is that we must be absolutely quiet about...
M	MRS. PAZZI	...what is it? ...you've forgotten the cigarettes.
M	KRENDLER	I came to pay my...
F	STARLING	...get outta my way, you sonofabitch...
M	KRENDLER	I realize, you're under a lot of....
F	STARLING	You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse TaskForce... Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir? Izzat the kind of publicity will aid Our Run for Congress? You swine, you...
M	KRENDLER	You're out she's out... You country Cornpone BITCH--hey, you Trailer Trash BITCH, you still looking for your Daddy, Beat you up, to show he Loves you? Looking for your Daddy, fuck you and mark you up, an... Well, here I am, you...
M	VERGER	Quod videt monumentum, circumspice. Need I translate?
M	CORDELL	If you would see him monument, look around you.
M	VERGER	Show me the Pigs.
M	CORDELL	Telephone call. From Switzerland, sir.
M	SECOND BRIGAND	I hit him with the beanbag gun, you stand by: he's still flopping... Just make sure he's alive, because I've already spent the bonus...
M	FELL	Della vigna was disgraced and blinded for his betrayal of his emperor's trust- -through avarice. Avarice and hanging are linked in the ancient and the madeadeval mind.
M	FELL (cont'd)	Judas and Pier Della Vigna are linked in Dante by the avarice he saw in them, and their subsequent deaths by hanging. Ah Commendatore Pazzi...
M	FELL (cont'd)	You are welcome. Since you are closest to the door, would you close the door, to improve the quality of the image. You will be interested in this, Commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's already in Dante's inferno... Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered a kinsman, and rests in hell awaiting the arrival of a Second Pazzi. But it's not you: it's Carlino, who will rest forever in hell for the crime of Treachery. Avarice, and Hanging, then. On the next occasion, you might like to discuss the matter of Chewing. Chewing in Dante: Count Ugolino, chewing the back of the archbishop's head--Satan, with his three Faces, chewing Judas, Brutus, and Cassius... all three traitors. Is it not? Thank you all for your kind attention. Would you say that I've preserved my job, Commendatore?
M	PAZZI	I'm not a scholar, Dottore. But it seemed as if they, as if they...
M	FELL	Yes, I think I amused them. To what do I owe...?
M	PAZZI	I require...
M	FELL	...yes, yes, yes... ...the effects of my predecessor.
M	PAZZI	I'd like to walk home with you, and...
M	FELL	Yes, of course, and we'll collect them. I won't be a minute... Ah, no. I should have shown them this one.. This one will interest you: let me see if I can improve the focus...
M	FELL (CONT'D)	Can you make it out, can you make out the name on the plaque? It says Pazzi. Pazzi. And a rude, a very rude poem, this is your ancestor. Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio Vecchio. Outside These Very Windows.
M	FELL (cont'd)	On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must confess to you: I'm giving serious thought to eating your wife. Yes. Your Wife. Laura. L'Orange, which is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you say? Or do I grow too personal? but that is what I think of, when I think of her. And how could I but think of her? I haven't had a bit all day. The kidney and the liver would be su1table for a dinner tonight. But the rest of the meat should hang for a week, in these cool conditions. Wouldn't you say? Nod once for yes. If you tell me what I need to know, then it would be convenient for me to leave without my meal. And Mrs. Pazzi will remain unscathed. I'll out the questions to you, and we'll see: I saw at the theatre you had betrayed me. And, when the police didn't come, it was clear you had sold me out. Was it to Mason Verger? Blink one for yes.
M	FELL (cont'd)	Thank you. And now: Are his hit men waiting outside? Was that a single blink? Yes. Thank you. No, no. I'm going to take the tape off. Please do not scream. Do you think you can keep from screaming? ...would it help if I were to cut your BOWELS OUT...?
M	BRIGAND ONE	...cover the backdoor. If he comes out, Kill him.
M	BRIGAND TWO	...the bonus was for...
M	BRIGAND ONE	Kill him, and cut him.
M	HANNIBAL	Young man...
M	HANNIBAL (cont'd)	Young man, I am desperate. If I am not at the Piazza Bellosguardo in ten minutes, it is the end of marriage. Do you think you could help me....?
M	VERGER	...how do you like it?
M	CHILD	It's real funny.
M	VERGER	Tell me the good news.
M	CORDELL	He escaped...
M	VERGER	Have the child taken to bed.
M	CHILD	I wanna see more...
M	CORDELL	What do you want me to do?
M	VERGER	Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling. He will come to her.
F	CRAWFORD	And I brought this for you...
F	STARLING	What is it?
F	CRAWFORD	Out of John Brigharn's Locker... Waal...
F	STARLING	I know you did what you could.
F	CRAWFORD	I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
F	STARLING	Reinstatement to what? There ain't nobody there...
M	NEWSIE	Starling, Agent Starling: what do you have to say to the New Accusations...?
F	STARLING	New...?
M	NEWSIE	You've been accused of...
M	NEWSIE (cont'd)	...leaking information to the Press, which resulted in the botched...
M	SECOND NEWSIE	Agent Starling: what was your reaction to your indictment...?
M	BRIGHAM	...indictment...?
M	SECOND NEWSIE	The district attorney today...
M	TRAVEL AGENT	Majorca, Greece.... oh, Aaand Turkey.... Mr. Bates, you're treating yourself to a Holiday you'll remember for...
M	TALKING HEAD	Of the American FBI agent, Clarice Starling, shown here, in her dramatic gun battle, last week, with...
M	TRAVEL AGENT	Mr. Bates...? Mr. Bates...?
M	TALKING HEAD	Dismissed from the FBI, she, it seems, is under criminal indictment for...
M	HANNIBAL	Could I, do you believe, change my Destination...?
M	TRAVEL AGENT	Well...well...what did you have in mind...?
M	CNN NEWSIE	...criminal indictment.... in quite a surprising move, against agent, that is, Former Agent... ...it's the F.B.I.
M	VERGER	Yes. Good. No. He will come. He will come. Do not let up on our Angel Starling. No. Now you must keep a constant watch on her. Use your toys--A transmitter in her car, a.... keep her in your sight... Do not let up, and he will come back for the wounded bird. He will find a way.
M	YOUNG GIRL	Let go, let go, let go.
M	YOUNG MOTHER	What are you doing to my son? Let him go!
M	YOUNG MOTHER	He's...what is he doing to my SON?
M	HANNIBAL	I beg your pardon, Madame, I was replacing his... I was trying...
M	STEWARDESS	...he was trying not to wake him.
M	HANNIBAL	I beg your pardon, if I caused you any Consternation. ...would you like some...? Your mother would disapprove. Of your taking food from a stranger. Ah. But she's asleep.. ARGUMENT, AND SMILES. And it's important, as I'm sure she's said, to Eat New Things! so important...
M	MAN ONE	...be easier if we just kill him.
M	MAN TWO	Be easier on everyone but us...
M	GENTLEMAN	It's going to be long...? Is going to be much longer, we should feed them...
M	CORDELL	Mmm. Is it going to work?
M	GENTLEMAN	The problem, if it is: the tape is not the true scream, an' the dummy, of course, is not the true man. BUT. Yes, yes, I think, is close enough....
M	CORDELL	So: the two problems are: they should be fed, and they should practice on a real...
M	GENTLEMAN	Yes. You could say, that the two, the two prob...
M	MAPP	Sad day.
F	STARLING	...what...?
M	MAPP	N'not that sad. Problem with suicide, y'know what they say?
F	STARLING	No.
M	MAPP	Every suicide kills two.
F	STARLING	Yeah. Well. They're a talkative buncha commentators.
M	MAPP	You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
F	STARLING	Trouble is, they all seem to die.
M	MAPP	Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
F	STARLING	What would you guess, Ardelia?
M	MAPP	You goin to shoot yourself?
M	MAPP	Don't shoot yourself.
F	STARLING	Why?
M	MAPP	Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you. Why dontcha gimme the gun? Gimme the rounds...
M	MAPP (cont'd)	Whyn'tcha go see that Headshrinker nobody knows you're seeing...? N'you make her earn her keep... ...you brush your hair first...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...the dream of your Father.
M	PSYCHIATRIST (cont'd)	Well, you're a courageous woman. Have courage, and tell me.
F	STARLING	He was shot...he was shot. On his rounds. And... and...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	That's when you went to the Orphanage...
F	STARLING	And all he left us: the Country brought back his hat, and his badge... both with a bullethole in them. An' that's what he left us. That's what I said.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	And you have been dreaming... dreaming about this Hat, and...
F	STARLING	And. I always said, he was a P'lice officer.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	...yes...?
F	STARLING	But. He was a night watchman. That's what he was. N'They brought back, his hat, his badge, an his timeclock. N'then they took me off. I saw... I saw. Clear as day, do you, do they call it a delusion? His hat an his badge. Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	When?
F	STARLING	But they were not there. Yesterday. Is that called a Delusion...? B'cause, you know, whatever it is, I can't take it anymore...
M	PSYCHIATRIST	I'm sorry. I'll have to take this in the other room.
M	PSYCHIATRIST (cont'd)	Not too far from a complete breakdown. Well, several things would--you've done the Badge, I suggest...
M	MAN	...got her staked out. Yeah, she's still in with the...
M	MAN (cont'd)	I said: she's still in with the... One moment...
F	STARLING	...who paid you... who... FBI where's your phone...?
M	STARLING (cont'd)	Mapp. Get me Ardelia Mapp. Well. Get in touch with her. Tell her...
M	CONVENIENCE STORE OPERATOR	...could I see some I.D.?
F	STARLING	Tell her that....
M	CONVENIENCE STORE OPERATOR	...you're really going to need to show me some identification.
F	STARLING	..this is Clarice Starling.. ...this is not a personal message...I... I...
M	VERGER	Yaaasss... Yaas. Turn the page, please....? ..and how is our prize...?
M	CORDELL	...thank you... And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
M	VERGER	Good evening, Dr. Lechter. Thank you for coming. I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances. But you will recall what the last time we met, you drugged me, and induced me, in that state, to scrape my face off and FEED IT TO THE DOGS. DID THAT DIVERT YOU? TELL HIM WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO RECIPROCATE!!!
M	CORDELL	...the bad news is: we're going to stick your feet through those bars tomorrow, and feed them to our pigs.
M	VERGER	Thank you, Cordell.
M	LECHTER	...but will that satisfy you?
M	VERGER	Why should you care?
M	LECHTER	It is not that I care for you--but that I posses an enquiring mind. What will you do when I am gone? When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
M	VERGER	ARE YOU DONE?
M	LECHTER	Yes.
M	VERGER	You don't wish to beg...?
M	LECHTER	Would that add to your mirth?
M	VERGER	Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow.
M	LECHTER	One would have thought he'd keep me under observation. To savor his triumph.
M	CORDELL	No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
M	LECHTER	...young boys, still...?
M	CORDELL	...here's to child abuse!
M	LECHTER	Mmm...
M	CORDELL	...and then, he'll be coming down.
M	LECHTER	You said the bad news...
M	CORDELL	Yes, I did.
M	LECHTER	I believe that your tone implied that there was some good news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for you...
M	CORDELL	Oh, yes, what? You'd bribe me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
M	LECHTER	I can make you rich.
M	CORDELL	And I expect you to. Let's talk like two medical men
M	CORDELL	Come on, stay with us. Look here: I could get behind you, and give you a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel anything down there, a l'il pulling is all. N'I'll tell you what, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta this stop your heart, an that's you done, an there's an end to it. What do you say...?

Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a code... move that money to me, he confirms it, and I fix you up Right Now... Whatsay?
M	LECHTER	..suitcase...locker...
M	CORDELL	Come on, Doctor, then you can sleep...
M	LECHTER	...unmarked hundreds....
M	CORDELL	....what...?
M	MAN ONE	...you wan me to shoot im?
M	CORDELL	That's the last think I want... Our other option is to beat you for a while, with this axe handle, here. I suppose this is what it feels like.
M	VERGER	Oh yes. Oh, yes, come here... Come here...Up Lad, When the Journey's Over, they'll be time enough for Sleep... Yes. Come here. For what good is Television, Educational as it may be, if it is not also entertaining.....come-- have some popcorn... Make it last, make it last, for godsake, make it last....don't "hurt" him...! Mr. Verger...?
M	VERGER	I'm awake. Oh. Is it Time!
M	VERGER (cont'd)	Oh, yes, one waits so long, and then, and then ...ALMOST BY MAGIC...Yes, proceed. Please.... proceed...
M	CORDELL	..It won't be long now, sir...
M	VERGER	OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
F	STARLING	On the ground, on the ground...
M	LECHTER	Good morning, Clarice.
F	STARLING	Can you walk? Are your legs working...?
M	LECHTER	Perhaps... shall we see...?
F	STARLING	I'm going to cut you loose. With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...? Do right and you'll live through this.
M	LECHTER	Spoken like a Protestant.
M	LECHTER (cont'd)	I'll do the rest, if you give me the knife.
F	STARLING	No, I don't think so. I'm going to subdue our friends, coming down the hill, and I want you to cuff em, and to put em inside with the other fella... My car is
M	LECHTER	Other fellow? There should have been two of them...?
M	VERGER	What's happening, would you please...?
M	CORDELL	Stop there, would you, please, Doctor...?
M	LECHTER	The girl could use some help.
M	VERGER	You're free...
M	LECHTER	...which of us is free...?
M	VERGER	Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime. The Greatest crime. Perhaps the only crime. I never ceased to hope!
M	LECHTER	The girl needs help.
M	VERGER	And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence. DON'T YOU THINK? IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU THINK? BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR THE PIGS!
M	LECHTER	...might I make a suggestion...?
M	VERGER	...after you' re dead. AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the word...
M	CORDELL	...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
M	LECHTER	Let the girl go.
M	CORDELL	Why?
M	LECHTER	For a consideration.
M	CORDELL	'fraid it's too late.
M	VERGER	...when I...
M	LECHTER	...what has she done to harm you...?
M	CORDELL	Yes, do you know, you're right... ...Mr. Verger...? Mr. Verger, Sir? He's ready... Hey, Franklin. Hey. Tell you what, if you'd just stop doing that, I'm going to give you something nice.
M	FRANKLIN	He don't like popcorn.
M	CORDELL	No. And...
M	FRANKLIN	I like Popcorn...
M	CORDELL	...yes, if you'll, just step away...
M	FRANKLIN	You give me whatever I want...?
M	CORDELL	Yes. You know I will. That's right.
M	FRANKLIN	Awright. You know what I want...? I WANT KITTYKAT!!!
M	LECHTER	Let me down, son, let me down.
M	FRANKLIN	What'll you do for me?
M	LECHTER	I'll take you home.
M	FRANKLIN	Ain't got no home.
M	LECHTER	Then what would you like...? Yes. You shall have it...
M	FRANKLIN	Then you goin to hell...
M	HANNIBAL	...that's right...
M	LECHTER	You look lovely.
F	STARLING	Thank you. No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you find me so..."
M	LECHTER	I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
F	STARLING	What is that that smells so wonderful.
M	LECHTER	I hope you'll find it so. Yes. It's good to see you regaining your strength...
F	STARLING	Thanks to you...
M	LECHTER	Now, what were we last speaking of...?
F	STARLING	We were speaking of my father...
M	LECHTER	...I'm sorry....?
F	STARLING	...we were speaking of my father...
M	LECHTER	Indeed we were.
F	STARLING	...and my need for The Institution...
M	LECHTER	Freud, do you know...? Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
F	STARLING	And how did he do that?
M	LECHTER	He saw the truth, and spoke it...
F	STARLING	I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
M	LECHTER	...you have to eat... You've sought out The Institution all your life, as you with it to replace your Father. This is obvious. Less obvious is this: that you require the institution not to support you, but to FAIL. FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE. ...as this keeps your father alive. The truth is two-fold, and the truth is one: That every man is fallible, that every institution, being made of men, cannot but be corrupt... ...the only art in this dish, of course, is that it must be fresh... That the institution cannot but be corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be but an act of complicity to seek to appease it. So many civilizations eat their slain enemies... what do you think...? How much better to devour a person physically, than to devour his spirit. Which is, of course, the purpose of the institution. :and that is the especial surprise, I've prepared for You!
F	STARLING	I feel weak...
M	LECHTER	...you must eat.
F	STARLING	...1 don't understand...
M	LECHTER	The gift, of course is not the meal-- but the identification--which of us does not need help? The identity, of your true enemy...? ...for you always sought to befriend, to wish the love of those who wished you ill. Come here--he is in no pain, there are no nerves in the brain, come here...
M	LECHTER (CONT'D)	Come here, I'm going to cure you.
M	LECHTER (cont'd)	Oh, no. Oh, NO. They've put a beeper on you. How careless of me. How finally careless, Do you think? Have I erred on Purpose? Eh? Or am I just unlucky? Could one not say that's the essential question of Philosophy...?
F	STARLING	Might I have some more of the wine...?
M	STARLING (cont'd)	Because, I find I like the effects. You may say that it's inebriation, but it seems This lovely evening, in particular.... it seems to reward me with clarity...
M	STARLING (cont'd)	....or perhaps, it is just the heat... I was just saying to the Doctor... But, do you know, do you know, I'm not feeling altogether....
M	SWAT MAN	...I've got her...
F	STARLING	...may be the heat....
M	KRENDLER	Let's get her out of here....
F	STARLING	But as my father used to say...
M	SWAT OFFICER	...ohmiGod.
M	MAPP	That's why it's a stone, you know, It means Don't Come Back.
F	STARLING	Well. No. He can't come back.
M	MAPP	Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom.
F	STARLING	Give me your gun...
M	MAPP	...what...? ...what, what did you say...?
