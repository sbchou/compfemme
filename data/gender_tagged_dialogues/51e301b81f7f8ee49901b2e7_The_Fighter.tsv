F	ALICE	Dicky had never been knocked down in his professional career, neither had Sugar Ray. They were both 21- yeahs-old.
M	MICKY	It was Dicky's first ten roundah. I know ya could question the judgement, first ten roundah against Sugar Ray Leonard, right? But as his managah, how could I not take a Sugah Ray? Do you see what I'm saying? It was the biggest thing that evah happened to Lowell.
M	MICKY	It was huge. People still talk about it to this day. It was a great fight.
F	ALICE	Tonight my son is gonna surprise everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard. Believe it, I know it. Micky and Sugar Ray are described over HBO clips.
F	ALICE	It's true! Sugar Ray had a hard time hitting Dickie, didn't really knock him down, but Dicky knocked Ray down! I wore a new white dress.

M	DICKY	I seen that Mexican fight, Micky! He hits very hard! 15 knockouts! Undefeated! Are you crazy? That idiot LoNano went right for it! He's usin' you to steal money! I wasted my 20s in bad fights set by you and Alice! I finally gotta good thing goin', shut up and be happy for me!

M	DICKY	I'm TALKIN' about the way you fight, you moron! You know I'm right! As Micky opens the door his face registers Dicky's words. It's awful. I know Sanchez is strong, really strong, but I

M	DICKY	I wanna make an amend to everyone here, I know I done a lot of stupid things, and I wanna say I'm sorry, and that's ovah. They all look at him.
M	DICKY	I'm very grateful to be back in this gym with you all. I gotta lotta time to make up for, and I wanna make the best of it.
M	DICKY (CONT'D)	You deserve the best, Micky, you have a chance to go all the way and I'm ready to be there for ya. Charlene and O'Keefe look upset. Awkward, everyone looking at Micky goes into the locker room. I can't tell ya how good it is to be back.
M	MICKY	You look good, your eyes are clear.
M	DICKY	I look good, right? Alice said lock up mighta been the best thing to happen to me. I got clean. I got clear up here (taps his head).
M	MICKY	That's beautiful, Dick. There's somethin' we gotta talk about.
M	DICKY	Hold on, I wanted to say' I been waitin' for this day, Micky, I been waitin' the whole time I was away. It kept me goin', it kept me alive, the idea of us workin' togethah again. Micky looks at him, nods. It's breaking his heart.
M	MICKY	I made a promise to them that I wouldn't work with you again. Dicky takes this in. Stunned.
M	DICKY	Ever?
M	MICKY	I had to. After everything that happened. I'm sorry. Dicky is hurt, stunned.
M	DICKY	The whole time I was away --
M	MICKY	I'm glad you're back, I'm glad you're doing good, I don't know what else to say. Micky, tears in his eyes, stares at Dicky a moment, nods, O'Keefe looks unsure as he holds the mits. Micky's about to Dicky walks back into the gym as Micky is about to work out
F	ALICE	What happened?
M	DICKY	He says I can't work with him.
F	ALICE	That's not right. [Dicky starts to leave] He never woulda won Sanchez without me!
M	MICKEY O'KEEFE	That's fuckin' bullshit! Take that back!
M	DICKY	Don't talk to my mother my mother like that.
F	ALICE	Why don't you ask Micky?
M	MICKEY O'KEEFE	They gotta go. If we're gonna train.
F	CHARLENE	They have to go, Micky.
F	ALICE	Why don't you ask Micky if he woulda won Sanchez without Dicky? Ask him. They all look at Micky. He is torn up over this as he
M	MICKY	I wouldn'ta won Sanchez without Dicky.
F	CHARLENE	How can you say that to O'Keefe?
M	MICKY	Because it's true. I went in with our plan and it wasn't working, I switched to what I learned with Dicky. Micky looks at O'Keefe, who is hurt. I wouldn'ta won it without you, either, O'Keefe, you know that.
F	CHARLENE	You got the focus and confidence from O'Keefe and Sal and your father and me!
F	ALICE	You were lucky to win that fight, Dicky saved him!
F	CHARLENE	We saved him! Dickya junkbag!
M	DICKY	Fuck you, Charlene, I'm 8 months sober.
F	CHARLENE	I'm sure you'll need somethin' for your back now that you're out.
M	DICKY	O'Keefe's in the same boat I am, one day at a time, why's it all right for him to be here, but not me? I'm blood.
M	MICKY	I'm the one fighting, not you, not you, and not YOU. I know what I need. And you need Dicky? Micky roils as he makes this decision.
M	MICKY	I want Dicky back. And I want you, Charlene, and I want O'Keefe, and my family.
F	CHARLENE	You can't do that to us.
M	MICKY	You sound like them now.
F	CHARLENE	Maybe you're just like them and that's where you belong. She looks at him, turns and walks out of the gym, followed by
F	ALICE	Everything happens for a reason, this could be for the best, honey. Micky watches Dicky get geared up with gloves, headgear, Alice's eyes glow.
M	RAY RAMALHO	Dicky Ecklund, the pride a Lowell! This rankles Micky as he and Dicky square off.
M	DICKY	I was trainin' in jail, so I'm ready. The two brothers spar, falling right back into it as Alice, And Micky comes over the top with a straight right off the Daddy, Daddy!
F	ALICE	Alice, take him home. [Little Alice leaves with Little Dicky]. What're you doin', Micky? What's the matter with you!
M	MICKY	Can this be my fight, for once, Alice, huh, just once, maybe just this one time, not for Dicky? I know you think he's comin' back, he's 40 years old and doesn't have a tooth in his head that's his own-- I can go ten more rounds, let's go-
F	ALICE	Let your brother talk.
M	DICKY	I'm Shea Neary, let's go, I'm Shea Neary, how ya gonna work me?
M	MICKY	Shut up!
M	DICKY	Shea Neary --
M	MICKY	Shut up! Dicky, hurt, stops.
M	DICKY	I'm the one who has this fight, this is my chance for a title, and I won't get another one after this. Am I being selfish? Am I saying Micky, Micky, Micky? I'm sorry, I thought I was fighting for a championship. He throws his gear off and starts to go when she runs to him,
F	ALICE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I didn't know what I was doing, I don't know why I did what I did, I did the best I could, I'll do better, I don't want to hurt you, Micky, I love you so much. As she holds him, Micky looks frustrated, but tears up in
M	GEORGE	Come on back--
M	DICKY	No, I gotta take care a something.
M	GEORGE	Micky wants you, I want you.
M	DICKY	Do ya, Georgie?
M	GEORGE	We gotta do this for Micky, come on. You're my son, too, Dick. Come on.
M	DICKY	You're my poppa, George.
M	DICKY	I gotta take care a something. He takes off, leaving George behind. I know what that means, don't do it, Dick. Come back. But Dicky keeps going. George watches, sad.
M	BOOBOO, WOLFIE, KAREN	Dicky's back! Hey, Dicky! Dicky limps toward them, slows down, looks at BooBoo, the Charlene, it's Dicky.
F	CHARLENE	Get off my porch, you piece of shit. Dicky presses the buzzer and won't stop.
F	CHARLENE	You fuckin' asshole!
M	DICKY	I know you can't fuckin' stand me.
F	CHARLENE	Really? What makes ya say that?
M	DICKY	I got no use for you eithah, but my bruthah loves ya and ya can't walk away 'cause a me. He don't deserve that. If you want me to quit, I'll quit.
F	CHARLENE	You're full a shit.
M	DICKY	Sweah to God, I'll quit if it makes you go back. Micky's got a chance to do somethin' I nevah did - Oh, the Sugah Ray Leonahd fight was my chance, I was great, I fought Sugah Ray Leonahd---
M	DICKY	Fuck you, Charlene. I came here to make things right -
F	CHARLENE	OK, let's make things right, numbah one: Ya didn't knock down Sugah Ray Leonahd, he tripped. I was in the fuckin' ring with 'im, Chalene, don't you think I know what happened? But I went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard, what the fuck have you evah done? Is your life so great? She doesn't say anything.
M	DICKY	Your eyes are red, you're hung ovah, don't tell me you're not. Ya life sucks.
F	CHARLENE	Maybe, the part without Micky sucks. Maybe I never did anything special like you, but I love Micky and I want him to have his chance.
M	DICKY	Then leave me alone. He needs me, you heard him, and I know he needs you, so let's spare him the bullshit from either one of us. She looks at him. Nods grudgingly.
F	CHARLENE	OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner, otherwise go fuck yourself. Dicky nods, walks off the porch. - What the hell are you doin' here?
M	DICKY	We worked it out fah you. Ask her. It's all together. Micky looks up and sees Charlene standing in the door. She
M	MICKY	Good. Get O'Keefe back, too.
M	DICKY	Micky nods, heads toward Charlene.
M	DICKY	- hey, Mick, you think I knocked down Sugah Ray Leonahd? Micky pauses, looks at his brother, says nothing.
M	MICKY	You went ten rounds, and he never hurt you. You were my hero.
M	DICKY	I was... He walks away.
M	MICKY	Do you want a ride home?
