M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CRISWELL	Greetings, my friend. You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable... that is why you are here. So now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened... We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal. The incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true story of Edward D. Wood, Junior??
F	DOLORES	Eddie, my dove just flew out the window!
M	CREW MEMBER	She goes on in two minutes! What are we gonna do??
M	ED	Dolores, give me your shoes.
F	DOLORES	What?
M	ED	The ghost can be barefoot. Give me your shoes!
M	CREW MEMBER	Wow.
M	ACTOR #1	Hey, I think I see something!
F	DOLORES	I offer you mortals the bird of peace, so that you may change your ways and end all this destruction.
M	ED	What a show! Everyone was terrific! Paul, your second-act monologue actually gave me chills,
M	PAUL MARCO	Aw thanks, Eddie.
M	CONRAD	I got the early edition! It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
M	ED	This is the big moment...!
M	BUNNY	What does that old queen know? He wasn't even there! Sending a copy boy to do his dirty work. Well fuck him!
F	DOLORES	Do I really have a face like a horse?
M	PAUL MARCO	What does "ostentatious" mean?
M	ED	Hey. Hey, it's not that bad. You just can't concentrate on the negative. He's got some nice things to say... See, "The soldier costumes are very realistic." That's positive!
M	ED	Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes! Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got terrible notices. But it was a huge hit.
M	PAUL MARCO	Lines around the block. So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
M	CONRAD	You really think so?
M	ED	Absolutely! It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
M	ED	Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if I just don't have it?
F	DOLORES	Ed, it was only one review.
M	ED	Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane." I'm already 30!
F	DOLORES	Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling.
M	ED	I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
F	DOLORES	Things'll change for us. Nobody stays on the fringe forever.
F	DOLORES	God, where's my pink sweater? I can never find my clothes anymore...
M	RUDE BOSS	Hey big shot, get off your ass. They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
M	ED	Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
M	ED	Whoa, look at all this sand. This is real sand! My God, where'd they get all this sand?!
M	SECURITY GUARD	Hey, YOU. This is a closed set.
M	OLD CRUSTY MAN	Hey, Eddie! Come in here. I got some great new stuff to show you.
M	ED	This is fantastic! What are you gonna do with it all?
M	OLD CRUSTY MAN	Eh, probably file it away and never see it again.
M	ED	It's such a waste. If I had half a chance, I could make an entire movie out of this stock footage! See, the story opens with these mysterious explosions. Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo. So the military is called in to solve the mystery.
M	OLD CRUSTY MAN	Ya forgot the octopus.
M	ED	No, I'm saving that for the big underwater climax!
M	SECRETARY #1	They say he was a girl trapped in a man's body.
M	SECRETARY #2	I'll bet it hurt when they snipped his thing off.
M	ED	What are you ladies gabbin' about?
M	SECRETARY #1	You know that Christine Jorgensen freak? He/she/it's in "Variety." Some producer is making a biopic.
M	ED	R-really? I didn't see the story.
M	SECRETARY #1	Ah, it was buried in the back. The guy's a real smallótime operator.
M	DOLORES (on phone)	Yes, I've got Mr. Edward Wood on the line. Could you please hold? Hello, Mr. Weiss? I heard about your new project and was curious if you signed a director. Oh -- you haven't? Well, if we could get together, I could explain why I'm more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town. Uh, I'd rather not go into it over the phone... Alright. Great! l'll see you then!
F	DOLORES	Eddie, I don't understand. Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
M	ED	Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
M	GEORGIE (on phone)	Look, when I said you could have the western territories, I didn't mean all eleven states! I meant California, Oregon, and uh, what's that one above it... Washington. Oh really?! Well screw you!
M	GEORGIE	Can I help you?
M	ED	Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
M	GEORGIE	Yeah, well a couple of things have changed. It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
M	ED	So you're not gonna make the movie?
M	GEORGIE	No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie! I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma. Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff. So we'll just make it without that she-male. We'll fictitionalize it.
M	ED	Is there a script?
M	GEORGIE	Fuck no! But there's a poster.
M	GEORGIE	It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
M	ED	Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy. I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct. And I'm good. I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
M	GEORGIE	Hmm. There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
M	ED	Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job. I like to dress in women's clothing.
M	GEORGIE	Are you a fruit?
M	ED	No, no, not at all! I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
M	GEORGIE	So you're not a fruit?
M	ED	Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2. 'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
M	GEORGIE	You gotta be kiddin' me.
M	ED	Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
M	GEORGIE	And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
M	ED	Yeah. I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
M	GEORGIE	Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look around you... I don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories. I make movies like "Chained Girls." I need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days that'll make me a profit. I'm sorry. That's all that matters.
M	BARTENDER	Are you gonna get something else?
M	BELA	Too constrictive. This is the most uncomfortable coffin I have ever been in.
M	SALESMAN	Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I've never had any complaints before.
M	BELA	The selection is quite shoddy. You are wasting my time.
M	ED	Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
M	BELA	I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
M	ED	No. I don't work here.
M	BELA	Huh?
M	BELA	Who are you? What do you want?
M	ED	I don't want anything. I'm just a really big, big fan. I've seen all your movies.
M	BELA	Ha!
M	ED	Why were you buying a coffin?
M	BELA	Because I'm planning on dying soon.
M	ED	Really?
M	BELA	Yes. I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
M	ED	You know, I saw you perform "Dracula." In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
M	BELA	Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
M	ED	I thought it was great. You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
M	BELA	Thank you.
M	ED	I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
M	BELA	I apologize. When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance. It takes me much time to re-emerge.
M	BELA	Oh, there's my bus. Shit, where's my transfer?!
M	ED	Don't you bave a car?
M	BELA	I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
M	ED	Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out?
M	BELA	I have no next picture.
M	ED	Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
M	BELA	Back in the old days, yes. But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
M	ED	But you're a big star!
M	BELA	No more. I haven't worked in four years. This town, it chews you up, then spits you out. I'm just an ex-bogeyman. Make a right.
M	BELA	They don't want the classic horror films anymore. Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
M	ED	The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
M	BELA	They were mythic. They had a poetry to them. And you know what else? The women prefer the traditional monsters.
M	ED	The women?
M	BELA	The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them. Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror.
M	ED	I never thought of that.
M	BELA	Take my word for it. You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
M	BELA	Ugh, what a mess. My wife of twenty years left me last month. I'm not much of a housekeeper.
M	BELA	Shh! I'm coming! I will feed you!
M	ED	Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
M	BELA	Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.
M	ED	Sweetie, you won't believe it! I've got the most incredible news!
F	DOLORES	You got the job?!!
M	ED	Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something better happened!
F	DOLORES	Better than not getting a job?
M	ED	Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody really big!
F	DOLORES	Who? Robert Taylor?!
M	ED	No! A horror movie star!
F	DOLORES	Boris Karloff!?
M	ED	Close! The other one!
F	DOLORES	You met Basil Rathbone!
M	ED	Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
F	DOLORES	I thought he was dead.
M	ED	No! He's very alive. Well... sort of. He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi! And he's really nice.
F	DOLORES	Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
M	ED	It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
F	DOLORES	So did you get his autograph?
M	ED	No. It wasn't like that at all. It was just the two of us, and we were talkin'... and he treated me like -- a friend...
M	RUDE BOSS	He's a bum.
M	ED	No he's not! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years? "Dracula"! "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
M	RUDE BOSS	Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work.
M	ED	That's not true --
M	RUDE BOSS	He's so great, you hire him.
M	ED	Well, uh, if I could I would... Ooo! Those eyes! He gives me the willies! The only thing scarier than him is this guy I dated last week: Charlie from Pittsburgh. Boy, talk about the living dead...
M	ED	Ugh! I hate the way she interrupts the pictures. She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
M	BELA	I think she's a honey. Look at those jugs.
M	BELA	Vampira! You will come under my spell! You will be my slave of love.
M	ED	Hey Bela, how do you do that?
M	BELA	You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.
M	BELA	I am getting tired. I need to take my medicine.
M	ED	Do you want me to get it for you?
M	BELA	No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.
M	BELA	I feel better now.
M	BELA	Children! I love children.
M	BELA	Aren't you scared, little boy? I'm going to drink your blood!
M	TOUGH BOY	Ehh, you're not a real vampire. You can't turn into a bat, and those teeth don't frighten me.
M	ED	Well how about these teeth?!!
M	BELA	Hey, how'd you do that?
M	ED	Dentures. I lost my pearlies in the war.
M	ED	Are you sure this is okay?
M	BELA	Don't worry. I do it every Halloween.
M	ED	Now what?
M	BELA	I am DRACULA!
M	BELA	I am the BAT!!
M	BELA	I am DRACUlA! I will LIVE FOREVER!!!
M	GEORGIE	So what's the big news you couldn't tell me over the phone... again?
M	ED	Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit. And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
M	GEORGIE	Tits.
M	ED	No. Better than tits -- a star!
M	GEORGIE	Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick. I don't make major motion pictures. I make crap.
M	ED	Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
M	GEORGIE	Yeah. Crap with a star.
M	ED	No! It would be something better! Something impressive. The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
M	GEORGIE	Fine, maybe you're right. But it doesn't friggin' matter. I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
M	ED	What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
M	GEORGIE	Who?
M	GEORGIE	Lugosi?
M	ED	Yeah! Lugosi!
M	GEORGIE	Isn't he dead?
M	ED	No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture. OUR picture?
M	ED	Uh, yeah. Our picture.
M	GEORGIE	Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
M	ED	Because he's my friend.
M	GEORGIE	Alright, fine! You can direct it. I want a script in three days, and we start shooting a week from Monday.
M	ED	Thank you! Bless you, Mr. Weiss! I promise I won't let you down!
M	ED (on phone)	But Bunny, you're perfect for this job! You're so good at organizing.
M	ED	You know these people. I need all the transsexuals and transvestites you can get. No, I don't care if they're not actors. I want realism. I want this film to tell the truth! I've waited my whole life for this shot, and I'm not gonna blow it.
M	BELA	Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
M	ED	Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character! Bunny, Bela's here. Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites! I need transvestites!
M	BELA	Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
M	ED	Well, It's about how people have two personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
M	BELA	Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde! I'm looking forward to this production.
M	ED	Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
M	BELA	I don't understand.
M	ED	Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
M	BELA	Ah, so I pull the strings!
M	ED	Yeah. You pull the strings -- "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
M	ED	Wipe off your hands. I've got a little surprise for you... I finished my script.
F	DOLORES	Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home.
M	ED	Well, I'd really like to know what you think. Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it? I'll Wait...
F	DOLORES	So that's where my sweater's been.
F	DOLORES	How long have you been doing this?
M	ED	Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.
F	DOLORES	Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
M	ED	This is my way of telling you --
F	DOLORES	What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
F	DOLORES	And what about this so-called "Barbara" character? It's obviously ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is our life!
M	ED	Of course it is. And that's why you should play the part.
F	DOLORES	Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
M	ED	It's a damn good role.
F	DOLORES	That's not the issue!! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
M	ED	It takes me comfortable.
F	DOLORES	Oh, just like in the script!
M	ED	Exactly. So what do ya say? Do you wanna break up... or do you wanna do the movie with me?
M	CONRAD	It's good to have a job. Now I can get my phone reconnected.
M	GEORGIE	I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
M	ED	There's still a sex-change --
M	GEORGIE	Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
M	ED	I don't think he's a schmuck.
M	GEORGIE	And what's with this new title?! My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
M	ED	So change the poster. Trust me, you'll be better off. This is a story that's gonna grab people. It's about this guy. He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her? Should he not tell her? He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
M	GEORGIE	Fine, shoot whatever baloney you want! I give up. Just make sure it's seven reels long.
M	ED (O.S.)	Excuse me, could I have everyone's attention?! Could you gather around? I've got something to say.
M	ED	Everybody, we're about to embark on quite a journey. Four days of hard work... but when it's over, we'll have a picture that'll entertain, enlighten, and maybe even move millions of people.
M	ED	Now the only way we're gonna achieve all this is if we stay on schedule. Day one -- TODAY -- we'll start easy. We have eighteen silent scenes that can be shot quickly: Cars parking, Patrick's suicide, me strolling as a man, me strolling as a woman, etc. After lunch, we'll bring in the Inspector and the Doctor. The Doctor is very important to the plot, so we might have to spend time on retakes. But it's worth it. Scene totals for the first day is thirty-four. Day Two, we'll be a little busier --
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	Excuse me Eddie, I don't mean to interrupt... but I'm gettin' a little worried about those clouds.
M	ED	Good thinkin'. We'll talk about Days Three and Four later. Now let's get that first shot off! It's Scene 17, Glenda looking in the window.
M	ED	Okay, do I need any touch-up?
M	MAKE-UP MAN HARRY	I'm telling ya, eyelashes are the way to go.
M	ED	Harry, we've discussed this a million times. I don't want to look like a girl. I want to look like myself.
M	MAKE-UP MAN MARRY	Fine. Then you look beautiful.
M	ED	PLACES, EVERYONE! ROLL CAMERA!
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	Rolling. And -- ACTION!
M	ED	
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	Don't you want a second take, for protection?
M	ED	What's to protect? It was perfect!
M	CREW MEMBER	Cops!
M	ED	We don't have a permit. RUN!
M	ED	The set doesn't look right! It looks too... empty. Clutter it up. Put a skeleton in the corner. And what's that thing over there?
M	PAUL MARCO	I don't know.
M	ED	Well it looks good. Let's use it!
M	GEORGIE	Ed! What's with these revised pages?! A scene in a smelting factory? A buffalo stampede?? Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio Beach??! What's going on here? I can't afford to film this nonsense!
M	ED	Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it.
M	GEORGIE	Then how's it gonna get in the picture?!
M	ED	I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free. This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
M	O.S. VOICE	Mr. Lugosi has arrived!
M	ED	Oh my God! Mr. Lugosi is here! Now everyone, when he walks on the stage Now everyone, when he walks on the stage, treat him normal. I know Bela Lugosi is a world-famous star, and you're all a little excited, but we're professionals. So if you treat him with respect, everything will be alright.
M	ED	Bela! It's so great to see you! And eight o'clock on the dot. Right on time!
M	BELA	I am always on time.
M	ED	Of course! Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there. Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
M	BELA	Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
M	ED	Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.
M	CONRAD	Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy, but could I have your autograph?
M	BELA	Of course.
M	CONRAD	You know which movie of yours I love, Mr. Lugosi? "The Invisible Ray." You were great as Karloff's sidekick.
M	BELA	"Sidekick"?? "KARLOFF"?!!
M	BELA	Fuck you!! Karloff doesn't deserve to smell my shit! That limey cocksucker can rot in hell, for all I care!!!
M	ED	What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
M	CONRAD	Nothin'! I told him he was great.
M	BELA	How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?!! You think it takes talent to play Frankenstein?! NO! It's just make-up and grunting! GRRR! GRRR! GRRR!
M	ED	You're right, Bela. Now Dracula, that's a part that takes acting.
M	BELA	Of course! Dracula requires presence. It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
M	ED	Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
M	BELA	BULLSHIT! I am ready now! Roll the camera!!
M	ED	Um, okay... roll camera
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	Rolling.
M	ED	Sound!
M	SOUNDMAN	Speed.
M	CAMERA ASSISTANT	Mark. Scene Thirty-One.
M	ED	And... action? "Beware. Beware! Beware, of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys! Puppy dog tails! Big fat snails! Beware. Take care. Beware!"
M	ED	Brilliant.
F	DOLORES	How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
M	ED	Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less.
F	DOLORES	Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
M	ED	Say it a little louder. I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
M	ED	Dolores. I need your help... "My mind's in a muddle. I thought I could stop wearing these things. I tried, honestly I tried..."
M	DOLORES (as BARBARA)	"Glen, I don't fully understand this. But maybe together -- we can work it out."
M	ED	
M	ED	And we fade out. "The End." What do you think?
M	GEORGIE	I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
M	ED	Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
M	GEORGIE	Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do? Make it seven reels long. I've got contracts with my exhibitors. If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
M	ED	Gee, I used every frame of film we shot. Maybe they won't notice.
M	GEORGIE	They'll notice. Look, why don't you let me take over from here? I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
M	ED	Um, I guess --
M	GEORGIE	Good. And one more thing. I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
M	ED	Why?! I did all those things! Hell, I even built the props.
M	GEORGIE	And you did a bang-up job, too. But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag. Trust me. It's a career killer.
M	ED	But I'm proud. I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
M	GEORGIE	Yeah?? Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
M	BUNNY	Daniel Who?!
F	DOLORES	Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
M	ED	Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
M	DOLORES (on screen)	"Glen. Is it another woman?" "Pull the string! Pull the string!"
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	I didn't shoot that!
M	ED	Georgie, what's with the stag footage?? You said you were cutting in establishing shots!
M	GEORGIE	I did. I established some tits and ass.
M	BELA	Wasn't I something..? Did you see how I command the screen?!
M	BUNNY	Ed, it was superb.
M	CONRAD	A great show! A little strange... but great -- especially my scenes.
M	ED	Just like I always promised. Now you're among the immortals. You're movie stars.
M	PAUL MARCO	Here's to Ed. For making us into something.
M	ED	From today on, our lives are different! We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
F	DOLORES	I don't know. It's so much money...
M	ED	Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
F	DOLORES	But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job.
M	ED	But you do! And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
M	ED	Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
F	DOLORES	Toss us out on our ass.
M	ED	Exactly.
M	ED	How 'bout a western? People love westerns.
M	BELA	But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?
M	ED	Eh, forget it. What else is big? Teenagers! Jailbait pics! Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
M	BELA	Who do I play?
M	ED	Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He's angry! He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way!
M	BELA	Well... can't I play the romantic part? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo! I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
M	ED	Sure. Romance, that's great! To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures. Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
M	BELA	That's good. I could use the money.
M	ED	But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit?
M	BELA	Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be "Dracula."
M	ED	Of course!
M	BELA	Those bastards at Universal. I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
M	ED	So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
M	BELA	We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
M	ED	They do? Shoot. There must be a way to get around that...
M	ED	Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!
M	BELA	Dracula?
M	ED	No! Doctor Acula! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.
M	BELA	Ah! This is very exciting.
M	ED	I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
M	ED	Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Feldman.
M	GUARD	What's your name?
M	ED	Edward D. Wood, Junior.
M	GUARD	Oh. Eh, he's in the Executive Building. You can park in the reserved section.
M	SECRETARY	Sir, Mr. Feldman will see you now.
M	MR. FELDMAN	Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
M	ED	It's Wood. Ed Wood.
M	MR. FELDMAN	Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you know. It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. Right?
M	MR. FELDMAN	So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans.
M	ED	Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show. I've got my own movie.
M	MR. FELDMAN	Really?! Well good for you.
M	ED	I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics. It opens next week.
M	MR. FELDMAN	Screen Classics? Hmm, don't know them.
M	ED	Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
M	MR. FELDMAN	I can't wait to take a look. So what's up next?
M	ED	Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small. So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
M	MR. FELDMAN	Doctor Acula? I don't get it.
M	ED	Dr. Acula!
M	MR. FELDMAN	Oh, "Dr. Acula." I get it. I don't like it.
M	ED	But Bela Lugosi's in it!
M	MR. FELDMAN	Lugosi's washed-up. What else you got?
M	ED	Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part. The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller. The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
M	MR. FELDMAN	Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like it. I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus. Maybe we can do business together. "Give this man satin undies, a dress, and a sweater... and he's the happiest man in the world. He can work better, think better, even play better -- and be more of a credit to his community and his government."
M	EXECUTIVE #1	What the hell is this?!
M	EXECUTIVE #2	Is this an actual movie?!
M	EXECUTIVE #1	It can't be.
M	EXECUTIVE #2	It's fuckin' ridiculous!
M	FELDMAN	Wait a minute. That guy in the dress -- he's the one I met with today! This must be a big PUT-ON! It's probably another one of Billy Wellman's practical jokes!
M	ED	Georgie, what happened?! I thought "Glen Or Glenda" was opening next week! Where's the ads?
M	GEORGIE	"Where's the ads"?! The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri! You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
M	ED	Why not??
M	GEORGIE	Because I can't sell it to save my life! You made a goddamn feathered fish. Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick? Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
M	ED	Maybe it needs special handling.
M	GEORGIE	Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
M	ED	You can't talk that way about my movie.
M	GEORGIE	"Your movie"?! I wish it was your movie! I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
M	BUNNY	So guess where I'm going next weekend?
M	ED	I don't know. Where?
M	BUNNY	Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
M	ED	I dunno. Lie on the beach?
M	BUNNY	WRONG! I'm getting my first series of hormone shots! And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
M	ED	Jesus! Are you serious?
M	BUNNY	Yes! I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS!
F	DOLORES	Ssh! Will you keep it down?
M	RING ANNOUNCER (amplified)	Now entering the ring, in the gold trunks, 350 bone-crunching pounds of pure strength, the "Swedish Angel"... Tor Johnson!!!
M	ED	My God, look at that guy. He's a mountain!
M	ED	I've never seen anything like him!
M	BUNNY	And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
M	ED	Ssh! He's so big! He's a monster! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
M	ED	Mr. Johnson, over here!
M	ED	Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
M	TOR	Da pleasure be mine.
M	TOR	Could we moovf to table?
M	ED	Oh, of course!
M	ED	So, Mr. Johnson --
M	TOR	Tor!
M	ED	Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
M	TOR	Mm, not good-lookink enough.
M	ED	I think you're quite handsome.
M	TOR	No. With hair, yah. But I must shave head for wrestlink. It scare da crowds. Dey like that.
M	ED	Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
M	TOR	But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent.
M	ED	Nah, that doesn't matter! It's a visual medium.
M	WAITRESS	Tor, what can I get ya?
M	TOR	I'll haf eight beers.
M	WAITRESS	And you?
M	ED	Uhh, I'll have just one.
M	TOR	And more nuts!
M	ED	So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo." He's tough. A brute. But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
M	TOR	I like. When do movie shoot?
M	ED	Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
M	ED	Wood Productions... Eddie... help me...
M	ED	Bela? Eddie... please come over --
M	ED	Bela?!
M	BELA	Eddie... my friend.
M	ED	Bela, what happened?!
M	BELA	I didn't feel well...
M	ED	Let me take you to the hospital.
M	BELA	No hospital. Just take me to the couch...
M	ED	Should I call a doctor?
M	BELA	Nah. This happens all the time...
M	ED	Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket?
M	BELA	Goulash.
M	ED	I don't know how to make goulash.
M	ED	What's in the needle?
M	BELA	Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I'm so broke. I don't know what I'm gonna do...
M	ED	Don't worry. I'll do something.
M	ED (on phone)	Mr. Feldman! I haven't been able to get through, so I just showed up. Yeah, out front! So, are we gonna be working together? Really? Worst film you ever saw...? Well, my next one will be better. Hello?
M	ED	I'm no good.
F	DOLORES	Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
M	ED	Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going... But of course I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
F	DOLORES	That's ridiculous.
M	ED	All I wanna do is tell stories. The things I find interesting...
F	DOLORES	Well maybe you're not studio kind of material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
M	ED	The movie is called "Bride Of The Atom"...
M	ED	...It will star Bela Lugosi. Each of you would put up $20,000...
M	ED	Yes, that's right. The Bela Lugosi. He's still alive. Huh? Is he available Friday night? Gee, I suppose so... Why?
M	BELA	"Greetings. I am the Count."
M	ED	"Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs. Applause. "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
M	BELA	"It is my home."
M	ED	"Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
M	BELA	"Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
M	ED	No Bela, that's "incorporates." Look, just say "This casket has..."
M	BELA	Ach! How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue? This live television is madness!
M	ASSISTANT	Five minutes, Mr. Lugosi.
M	HOST	And then what's gonna happen?
M	CRISWELL	In 1960, the automobile will have retractable wings, so it can fly.
M	HOST	Sounds like a heck of a way to beat traffic.
M	CRISWELL	By 1970, Man will have colonized Mars. Millions of people will live there.
M	ED	Wow! Ain't that something.
M	BELA	Greetings. I am the Count.
M	HOST	Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
M	HOST	Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
M	BELA	It is my home.
M	HOST	Oh, tract housing, huh? I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank. What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower. I still don't know where to hang the towels!
M	BELA	Uh, beg to differ.
M	HOST	"Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
M	BELA	Uh, Greetings. I am the Count...
M	HOST	I told you we should've gotten Karloff.
M	ED	Bela, don't worry. You're better than all this crap.
M	BELA	I never said I could ad-lib...
M	ED	Forget about it. We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
M	CRISWELL	Mr. Lugosi! It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you. Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
M	BELA	It's a pleasure...
M	CRISWELL	Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
M	ED	Wow.
M	CRISWELL	And who may you be?
M	ED	Edward Wood, Sir.
M	CRISWELL	Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
M	ED	H-how'd you know?!
M	CRISWELL	I'm Criswell. I know all.
M	CRISWELL	Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
M	BELA	No. I never drink -- wine.
M	ED	Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970? How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even
M	CRISWELL	I guessed.
M	ED	I don't understand.
M	CRISWELL	I made it up. It's horseshit!
M	CRISWELL	There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
M	ED	It's that easy?
M	CRISWELL	Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
M	CONSERVATIVE MAN	Excuse me. We're here for the Wood party.
M	DOORMAN	Ah, that would be in the Venetian Room, sir.
M	ED	We're gonna have the most terrifying monster ever seen on film! A ghastly creature created from an atomic mutation!
M	BACKER'S WIFE	I don't like scary movies. I go more for ones with love stories.
M	ED	Well that's what this movie is... a heartbreaking romance! It's about a young reporter, Janet Lawton, in love with a young cop, Dick Craig.
M	ED	What do you think you're doin'?!
M	CONRAD	These shoes are itchy.
M	ED	You can't sit! You gotta walk around, with good posture. You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll never invest in our movie.
M	AMAZED BACKER	Bernie, get a load of this guy!
M	TOR	Biceps 22! Chest 62! Stomach 54!
M	AMAZED BACKER	Whew! You're quite a specimen. And you're gonna be in the picture?
M	TOR	Yes. I play Lobo!
M	HICK BACKER	Mr. Lugosi, I can't believe I'm meeting you in person. This is one of the most exciting moments of my life.
M	BELA	Thank you. And you are?
M	HICK BACKER	Charlie Johnson! I manufacture toothpaste tubes.
M	CRISWELL	I predict "Bride Of The Atom" will be the biggest moneymaker of all time!
M	ED	And this is lovely starlet Dolores Fuller, who will play Janet Lawton.
M	SOUTHERN BACKER	And how much will this picture cost?
M	ED	In a normal studio it would be half-a-million, with all their wasteful overhead and fancy offices. But because we're more efficient, we can bring it in for seventy grand!
M	SOUTHERN BACKER	Hmm. Well I'll consider it...
M	ED	Goodbye! Goodbye!
M	BELA	So how'd we do?
M	ED	We didn't make a dime.
M	VALET	That's twenty-five cents, sir.
M	WIFE	I gave all my money to the babysitter.
F	DOLORES	Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his money.
M	ED	Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
F	DOLORES	Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
M	ED	That's the problem! Nobody cares about my movie! I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
F	DOLORES	Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job.
M	ED	Dolores, don't you understand? I'm a director now! I made "Glen Or Glenda." Directing is my day job.
F	DOLORES	All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
M	PAUL MARCO	Uh, yoo-hoo. Excuse me! Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
M	ED	Yeah...?
M	PAUL MARCO	Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East. She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's very interested in the picture business!
F	LORETTA	Pleased to meet you. I'm Loretta King.
M	ED	I understand you just moved here?
F	LORETTA	Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.
M	WAITER	Water, Ma'am?
F	LORETTA	No! No water! NO LIQUIDS! I'm terribly allergic to them!
M	ED	So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
F	LORETTA	Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
M	ED	For this one, we need $60,000.
F	LORETTA	That's all?? That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
M	ED	Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
F	LORETTA	Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
M	ED	Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
F	LORETTA	Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton. I'd sure like to play her.
M	ED	J-Janet Lawton???
M	LORETIA	Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part to play. She's got some real meaty scenes! Can't you just see me in that part??
M	ED	Uh... yeah... You'd be perfect.
M	DOLORES (o.s.)	You bastard! You two-timing, dress-wearing son-of-a-BITCH!!
M	ED	It was the only way I could get the movie made!
F	DOLORES	Who do you think's been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
M	ED	I'm sorry! What did you want me to say?
F	DOLORES	I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
M	ED	But there's plenty of other parts.
F	DOLORES	Like what?!
M	ED	The secretary. Or the file clerk.
F	DOLORES	YOU ASSHOLE!
M	ED	This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies. I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
M	BUNNY	You mean a Tesla coil?
M	ED	If you say so.
M	TOR	Edvard! I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read. And she no like.
M	ED	Really? Was the third act too intense?
M	TOR	No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
M	ED	But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
M	TOR	Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
M	ED	Tor, dialogue is overrated. You look at the classic film actors, who are they? Fairbanks. Chaplin. They didn't talk! They did it all with their face.
M	TOR	But Greta say --
F	LORETTA	Eddie, which dress do you like better?
M	ED	I don't know. Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	Which one is the red one?
M	ED	What do you mean?
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind. But I like the dark gray one.
M	ED	ACTION!
M	ED	Okay, you're Dr. Eric Vornoff. You're upset. You've worked so hard on this experisent, and you don't want to see it fail. No, you're not that upset. You want to keep moving. You wanna cross the room.
M	ED	Alright, let's go immediately to Scene 52. Tor, are you in place?
M	TOR'S VOICE	Yah.
M	ED	Okay, CUE RAINSTORM!
M	ED	And roll camera! ACTION!
M	ED	Okay, you're Lobo. You're upset. You've worked so hard helping Dr. Vornoff on this experiment, and you don't want to see it fail. No, you're not that upset. You want to keep moving. You wanna cross the room.
M	BELA	At Universal, they shot two scenes a day. Eddie can knock off twenty or thirty! He's incredible.
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
M	ED	No, it's fine. It's real! In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
M	ED	Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
M	PAUL MARCO	We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
M	ED	Nah, it'll work. Where's Bela?
M	ED	Bela, are you ready?
M	BELA	Mmph? Where am I?
M	ED	You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
M	ED	You'll be sitting on the right.
M	BELA	I'm not getting near that goddamn thing. One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
M	ED	Okay. Then you'll be sitting on the left.
M	ED	Here's the scene. Loretta, you're in a trance. You glide in and get on the operating table. Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down. But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
M	TOR	Okey-dokey.
M	ED	ACTION!
M	BELA (as VORNOFF)	"Now we are ready for the girl."
M	BELA	"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty. A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!" Damn! Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this. I'm an old man. It's too long.
M	ED	That's fine, Bela. We're still rolling. Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
M	BELA	"Dear, you're lovely." "Strap her to the table."
M	BELA	"Do as I command you!"
M	BELA	"I'll teach you to disobey me!"
M	ED	
M	TOR	I love being movie star!
F	LORETTA	Ow. Not so hard, Tor.
M	SURLY STAGE MANAGER	Hey, Wood. Your check bounced.
M	ED	Okay, I'll get you the money later. No. I need it NOW.
M	ED	Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
F	LORETTA	Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
M	ED	Yeah. Exactly!
M	ED	I kinda need it now.
F	LORETTA	What are you looking at me like that for? I already gave you my three hundred.
M	ED	Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
F	LORETTA	What other sixty-thousand?
M	ED	The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
F	LORETTA	You misunderstood. I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
M	ED	Oh my God.
M	BELA	Here we go again.
M	PAUL MARCO	So is Dolores coming?
M	BUNNY	I can't imagine why. I wouldn't put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars...!
M	ED	...lemme tell you, you can't lose. It's scary! And if you don't like that, it's romantic! Bela Lugosi portrays Dr. Vornoff, and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporter Janet Lawton.
M	POTENTIAL BACKER	Hmm. Lugosi looks pretty old. Which role is Vampira playing?
M	ED	Vampira...? Why do you ask??
M	POTENTIAL BACKER	Well I see her standing over there.
M	ED	Well... she's playing -- Could you excuse me one moment??
M	ED	Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
M	VAMPIRA	Yes?
M	ED	You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood. I'm a film producer. I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson. And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
M	VAMPIRA	I don't understand. Do you want my autograph?
M	ED	No. I think my film is perfect for you.
M	VAMPIRA	You want me to show it on my TV program? Well I got nothing to do with that. You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
M	ED	No! I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be in it! See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down. So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money. Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
M	VAMPIRA	Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
M	ED	Please! It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers! There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
M	VAMPIRA	Look buddy, I'm a big star. I've got real offers from real studios. I don't need to blow some dentist for a part. So forget it!
M	BACKER	I'm getting a bad feeling about this. Let's get out of here.
M	ED	Where are you guys going?! You can't leave!
M	BACKER	Goodbye, Mr. Wood.
M	ED	You can't go! You haven't seen the storyboards!
M	ED	Fine! SCREW YOU! If you don't have the balls to roll the dice, then I don't want your stinking money!!
M	ED	Please, come back!
M	ED	Goddamn landlord.
F	DOLORES	I told you this was gonna happen.
M	ED	Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
F	DOLORES	That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
M	ED	Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I blew it! I thought she was rich.
F	DOLORES	That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
M	ED	I didn't dump you! Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
F	DOLORES	You're a fuckin' mess.
M	ED	So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
F	DOLORES	I'm going to my mother's.
M	ED	Does she have room for me?
F	DOLORES	I think you should stay with one of your friends.
M	ED	Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
M	BELA	Stop worrying. This is going to raise your spirits.
M	LECTURER	Thou eternal sun, who has covered the consciousness with thy golden disc, do thou remove the veil so that I may see the truth within?
M	ED	What is this place?
M	BELA	This is the Philosophical Research Society. A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
M	LECTURER	...for the truth which is within thee is within me. And I am Truth.
M	BELA	Most people in this country, they know nothing, about Eastern mysticism. They are afraid of it. But I am open-minded. It gives me hope.
M	LECTURER	We have the wisdom to govern and the divine right to inherit the earth in good condition. We have the power to build worlds.
M	ED	Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
M	BELA	Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.
M	ED	But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
M	BELA	Eddie, you screwed up.
M	ED	Yeah, I did.
M	BELA	In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered. Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me. The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
M	ED	Really?
M	BELA	It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
M	ED	So why didn't you do it?
M	BELA	I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
M	ED	But maybe not.
M	BELA	Correct. So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback. Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
M	ED	Your next film. That will be the one.
M	ED	...and then Dr. Vornoff falls in the pit, and his own octopus attacks and eats him! The End.
M	OLD MAN McCOY	Whew! That's quite a story. So you made the movie, and now you want to make it again?
M	ED	No. We shot ten minutes of the movie, and now we're looking for completion funds.
M	OLD MAN McCOY	Son, you're too vague. I come from the world of business. I need to know what I get for my investment.
M	ED	Movies are very popular. You could make a lot of money.
M	OLD MAN McCOY	Yeah, but most of 'em flop, don't they? What am I tangibly guaranteed?
M	ED	Well... you get "Executive Producer" credit.
M	OLD MAN McCOY	That don't mean diddley. BILLY BOB! You're cutting 'em TOO LEAN.
M	ED	Mr. McCoy, how can I make you happy?
M	OLD MAN McCOY	Cut to the chase, heh? That's good! That's very good.
M	OLD MAN McCOY	Okay, two things. Number one: I want the movie to end with a big explosion. Sky full of smoke.
M	ED	But the story ends with Dr. Vornoff falling in the pit --
M	OLD MAN McCOY	Not anymore. And number two: I've got a son. He's a little slow -- but a good boy. And something tells me he'd make a hell of a leading man...
M	WRESTLING COACH	Tor, you got a phone call!
M	TOR	Heh? NOW?
M	WRESTLING COACH	They said it was an emergency!
M	TOR	Hallo?
M	ED'S VOICE	Tor, this is Ed! Glad I could find you! I got the money, and we resume shooting tomorrow morning!
M	TOR	But I'm in Utah.
M	ED'S VOICE	Then you'll have to drive all night! I'm counting on you, big guy. Breakfast is at seven.
M	PAUL MARCO	This is unbelievable! I woulda bet a million bucks that Ed wouldn't finish this picture.
M	CAMERAMAN BILL	It ain't finished yet. Anything could happen.
M	BUNNY	Uh-oh. Stay out of scratching distance.
M	ED	Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
F	DOLORES	Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
M	ED	That's right...
F	DOLORES	I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug?
M	TONY	"Now Janet, I want you straying away -- oops -- staying away from the old Willows Place."
M	ED	That's Tony McCoy. He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
F	DOLORES	Oh really? How much money did he put up?
M	ED	None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.
F	DOLORES	Wood Productions. The mark of quality.
M	ED	Hey, the movie's getting made. That's the main thing.
M	DOLORES (O.S.)	Hey Harry -- long time no see.
M	MAKE-UP MAN HARRY	Hi Dolores...
M	LORETA	Oh, you're Dolores?! I've heard so much about you! I'm Loretta King. Here, take the chair.
F	DOLORES	Don't be silly -- let Harry finish. You still need more work.
F	LORETTA	No, I'm done. All I needed was a touch-up.
F	DOLORES	Mm, that mole still shows.
M	ED	Ladies! You both look fine. Why don't we talk about the scene? Okay. Janet Lawton has discovered that Dr. Vornoff bought the old Willows estate. So now she wants to prove that all the monster stories are true.
F	DOLORES	Eddie, what's my motivation?
M	ED	Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
F	DOLORES	But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
M	ED	Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie. Quit kidding around. "Janet, the boss has been looking for you." "Thanks."
F	DOLORES	Of course it was.
M	CRISWELL	Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico!
M	ED	Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
M	CRISWELL	My pleasure. I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
M	TOR	My head is cold.
M	CRISWELL	You know how much this car cost me?
M	CONRAD	Ten thousand dollars.
M	CRISWELL	ONE DOLLAR! Miss Mae West herself sold it to me. She said, Cris, you belong in a pink Cadillac!
M	CRISWELL	Incidentally, you promise you're not going to scratch my car...?
M	ED	I told you, the octopus is made of rubber. This is a piece o' cake.
M	PAUL MARCO	Ed, you said you were getting permission.
M	ED	Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day. But this'll be great, I promise!
M	TOR	I'm no good at climbink.
M	TOR	I'm good at bashink!!
M	CRISWELL	Hey, keep it down. My publicist will throttle me if we get caught.
M	ED	Oh. I thought they kept this open.
M	TOR	Lobo will fix!
M	CONRAD	Wow.
M	PAUL MARCO	This place gives se the creeps. Let's get the hell out of here.
M	ED	Not so fast. First we have to get it down.
M	PAUL MARCO	You're sure this is gonna work?
M	ED (O.S.)	Yes!
M	PAUL MARCO	You're sure??? YES! JUST DO IT!
M	CRISWELL	Oh my God. We killed him.
M	ED	Tor! Are you okay?!
M	TOR	Bedder than wrestlink!
M	ANGRY VOICE	Hey! What are you doing?!
M	CRISWELL	Thank God Tor broke the fence.
M	TONY	"Now Janet, I want you staying away from the old Willows Place."
M	ED	You don't understand! The octopus is supposed to live in a lake!
M	CONRAD	This is kind of a stream--
M	ED	NO! It has to be UNDERWATER!
M	BELA	Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
M	ED	Nonsense! You look great -- Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap? We'll film around you for a while.
M	ED	Thanks, buddy...
M	ED	Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where's the octopus motor?
M	PAUL MARCO	What octopus motor?
M	ED	You know, to make the legs move --
M	PAUL MARCO	Hey, don't blame me! You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
M	BELA	Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?
M	ED	You'll be fighting with the octopus.
M	BELA	Out there?! What happened to the stream?
M	ED	This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
M	BELA	Oh, for Christ's sake.
M	BELA	Goddamn, it's cold!
M	ED	Once you're in it, it warms up.
M	BELA	Fuck you! You come out here. Hey, toss me that J.D.
M	BELA	Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
M	ED	Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
M	BELA	Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
M	ED	Huh?
M	BELA	After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"! But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough. It was too degrading for a big star like me.
M	ED	Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
M	BELA	Don't let me slow you down.
M	ED	Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND!
M	ED	ACTION!
M	ED	
M	ED	C'mon! Just one more day! Just have some coffee, you'll feel better!
M	TONY	Mr. Wood, I only got one hour of sleep.
M	ED	Yeah? Well I got no sleep, and I feel great!
M	ED	Bela. I just wanna thank you again for last night.
M	BELA	That's fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty.
M	ED	No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
M	BELA	Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
M	ED	I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
M	BELA	Eddie, this is quite a scene.
M	ED	I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
M	BELA	These lines -- I'll have no problem remembering.
M	STROWSKI	"Our government wants you to return... to continue your experiments there. Where you can have everything at your disposal." "My dear Professor Strowski, twenty years ago I was banned from my home land. I was classed as a madman -- a charlatan -- outlawed in the world of science which previously honored me as a genius!" "Now here in this forsaken jungle hell, I have proven that I am alright."
M	STROWSKI	"Yes, the authorities have learned how correct your findings were. So I am here -- sent to bring you home."
M	BELA	"Home. I have no home. Hunted... despised... living like an animal -- the jungle is my home! But I will show the world that I can be its master. I shall perfect my own race of people -- a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!"
M	ED	Cut. It's a wrap.
M	CRISWELL	So you sleep in coffins?!
M	BELA	Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.
M	CRISWELL	I can't believe this! I sleep in coffins!
M	BELA	No.
M	CRISWELL	YES! My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
M	GIRLFRIEND #1	"McCoy Meat Packing"? Are you sure there's a party here?
M	VAMPIRA	Yeah, I got this invitation. It's a "Bride Of The Atom" party, whatever that means.
M	PAUL MARCO	"Glen Or Glenda," now that was a hell of a picture.
M	CONRAD	Well, this new one's gonna be a hundred times better.
M	PAUL MARCO	Is that possible?
M	VOICE	Go, baby, go!
M	VAMPIRA	I don't believe it. It's him!
F	DOLORES	You people are INSANE! Take a look around -- you're all FREAKS!
F	DOLORES	You're wasting your lives making SHIT! Nobody cares! These movies are TERRIBLE! I can't take it any longer!
M	ED	Dolores, wait!
F	DOLORES	Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
M	ED	Did you really mean those things you said..?
F	DOLORES	I'm tired of living on the fringe.
M	ED	But you used to say --
F	DOLORES	Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. Now that it's done, so am I.
M	ED	Yeah... Ed, dit I wake you? It's two in avternoon.
M	ED	No, I was just doin' a little work...
M	TOR (on phone)	Bullchit! You been like dis too many days. I want to cheer you up.
M	TOR	Edvard, you come!
M	TOR	I'm so happy you visit. Meet my family! Greta, Karl, and Connie!
M	CONNIE	Pass the meatballs.
M	KARL	This strudel is delicious, Mama.
M	TOR	Hey! You're not eatink.
M	ED	Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
M	TOR	The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
M	ED	I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
M	TOR	Don't worry. You just haven't met right woman yet. Oopsy. That cabbage goes right through me.
M	ED	Greta, your husband is a terrific actor. You should come down and visit the set.
F	GRETA	I don't think so.
M	ED	No, it's really no problem at all!
F	GRETA	I do not approve of what you do with my husband Tor. He is not a monster. These horror pictures are humiliating.
M	TOR (O.S.)	OUCH! GODDAMMIT!
M	TOR	Look, it happened again!
M	ED	Tor, I should be getting home.
M	TOR	Nonsense! You must try our hot glug.
M	TOR	My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see? No! Many duds, before I find her.
M	ED	But I thought me and Dolores had something.
M	TOR	Forget her! Move on. A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
M	VAMPIRA (on TV)	Ooo! That was so scary, it gave me goosebumps. No, dummy! I didn't say "goose," I said "goosebumps." Ugh! Well, be sure to join me next week, for "THE MUMMY'S CURSE." Until then... pleasant nightmares.
M	VAMPIRA	God, we need some better jokes on this show.
M	ASSISTANT	Vampira, you got a phone call.
M	VAMPIRA	At this hour? Hello?
M	ED'S VOICE	Vampira! Hi, this is Ed Wood.
M	VAMPIRA	Who?
M	ED'S VOICE	Ed Wood! You came to my party. I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
M	VAMPIRA	Oh. Yeah. You.
M	ED'S VOICE	Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
M	VAMPIRA	You mean like a date? I thought you were a fag.
M	ED'S VOICE	ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
M	VAMPIRA	Isn't that the same thing?
M	ED'S VOICE	No, no! I like girls. So how 'bout Friday?
M	VAMPIRA	Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type. But keep in touch. Let me know when your movie opens.
M	ED'S VOICE	Excuse me. Is that angora?
M	NORMA	Why... yes.
M	ED	Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
M	NORMA	I suppose. It's very expensive.
M	ED	It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
M	NORMA	What are you, an angora wholesaler?
M	ED	No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
M	NORMA	Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that.
M	ED	Two people do. Orson Welles and me.
M	NORMA	Wow.
M	ED	You know, you're a very attractive girl.
M	NORMA	My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
M	ED	You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
M	CRISWELL	So who's the surprise for?
M	PAUL MARCO	I dunno. Ed was real mysterious. All he'd say was it's a surprise party.
M	CRISWELL	Isn't that like him! And isn't that like us -- that we show up anyway.
M	CRISWELL	Excuse me. We're here for the Wood party.
M	GUARD	They've rented Stage 12. Drive straight back.
M	BELA	So what are we doing here?
M	TOR	Nobody knows. But there's a lotta booze.
M	ED	Excuse me! Could everyone please quiet down? First of all, I want to thank you, all my good friends, for being here tonight. And second, if you're wondering what the big surprise is... well, TONIGHT I'M GETTING MARRIED!!
M	ED	Everybody, this is Norma!
M	BELA	Who the fuck is she??
M	TOR	I never heard of her.
M	ED	And Bela, I want you to be the best man!
M	MINISTER	...Norma, do you promise to love, honor, and cherish...
M	BUNNY	I didn't even know he had a girlfriend.
M	PAUL MARCO	I hear she's an actress who gave him money.
M	CONRAD	Nah, I heard she's his childhood sweetheart from Poughkeepsie.
M	CRISWELL	I predict it's Dolores in a mask.
M	MINISTER	...in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
M	ED	I do.
M	MINISTER	Then I now pronounce you man and wife.
M	ED	Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma. Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma. Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
M	PAUL MARCO	So how long have you known Eddie?
M	NORMA	Since Tuesday.
M	CRISWELL	Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
M	ED	Yeah. It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know. She's perfect for me.
M	ED	Oop, that's our cue! Honey, we gotta go. GOODBYE, EVERYBODY!
M	NORMA	Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
M	ED	Don't worry, I'll teach you.
M	NORMA	Be understanding. I don't know anything.
M	NORMA	What the heck is THIS?!!
M	ED	Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
M	NORMA	Stay away from me! You're perverted!
M	ED	Please, be compassionate. I'm your husband!
M	NORMA	No you're not! This marriage was never consummated. I'm getting an annulment!
M	ED	Bela, let me in! Bela, it's Eddie.
M	BELA	Why are you here??
M	ED	Shit! Bela, what's with the gun?
M	BELA	Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
M	ED	Norma. She changed her mind. She doesn't wanna marry me. Can you put down the gun?
M	ED	What are you doing?
M	BELA	I was thinking about killing myself.
M	ED	Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened?
M	BELA	Eddie, I received a letter from the government. They're cutting off my unemployment. That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
M	ED	Don't you have any savings?
M	BELA	I'm obsolete. I have nothing to live for. Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me.
M	ED	Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
M	BELA	It'll be wonderful. We'll be at peace. In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
M	ED	Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
M	BELA	Formaldehyde.
M	ED	Straight up or on the rocks?
M	ED	Don't worry.
M	BELA	I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm so sorry.
M	ED	Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.
M	NURSE	My goodness, you gave me the willies. You look like that Dracula guy.
M	BELA	My name is Bela Lugosi. I wish to commit myself.
M	NURSE	For what reason?
M	BELA	I have been a drug addict for twenty years. I need help...
M	ED	Hello.
F	KATHY	Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
M	ED	I got married last night.
F	KATHY	Oh. Congratulations.
M	ED	The marriage already ended.
F	KATHY	Oh. My condolences.
M	ED	What are you making?
F	KATHY	Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.
M	ED	How long's he been here?
F	KATHY	This is my thirteenth pair.
M	ED	Excuse me. Doctor? I'm with Mr. Lugosi. How is he?
M	DOCTOR	Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
M	ED	Will he be okay?
M	DOCTOR	We'll do our best.
M	ED	Hi, Lillian.
M	NURSE	Hi, Ed. Boy, he's got a lot of visitors today.
M	ED	He does?
M	ED	What's going on here?! Excuse me!
M	ED	Everybody out! This is a hospital! Get out of here.
M	ED	What happened?!
M	BELA	Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
M	ED	Bela, they're parasites! They just want to exploit you.
M	BELA	Fine. Let them! There is no such thing as bad press. A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page! First celebrity to ever check into rehab. When I get out of here, I will be healthy. Strong! I will be primed for my comeback!
F	KATHY	Oh, it's you again.
M	ED	Oh, hi.
F	KATHY	You look beat.
M	ED	I am. How's your father?
F	KATHY	He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
M	ED	Not good...
F	KATHY	Well, I made him some booties to cheer him up. They're black -- to match his cape.
M	ED	Would you maybe like to get a coffee..?
M	DOCTOR	We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
M	ED	Isn't he?
M	DOCTOR	No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
M	ED	Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got. I have a few hundred dollars.
M	DOCTOR	That won't even begin to cover it. He's going to have to leave.
M	ED	Bela, wake up.
M	ED	I've got some good news. The doctor says you're all better. You can come home.
M	BELA	Really? I don't feel so great.
M	ED	No, you look good. And the tests came back fine. C'mon...
M	BELA	Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
M	ED	Soon, Bela... Soon.
M	ED	Please, I just need it for one afternoon!
M	OLD MANAGER	Ed, if I cut a deal for you, I gotta cut one for everybody.
M	ED	This is different! It'll mean so much to me. All I need is a camera and a tripod. No lights, no sound. Nothin' fancy.
M	OLD MANAGER	And that's it?
M	ED	And one roll of film.
M	BELA	This is so exciting. Another production!
M	BELA	So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
M	ED	No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
M	BELA	Oh. So what is the scene about?
M	ED	Uh... you're a very important and respected man. You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
M	BELA	Okay. But what if I'm not in too big a hurry? What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life? To smell a flower?
M	ED	That's great. Let's do a take.
M	ED	Okay, roll camera! Rolling. Scene One, Take One! And... ACTION!
M	ED	And, cut...
M	BELA	Eddie, how was I?
M	ED	Perfect.
M	BELA	Good. Now what about my close up?
F	KATHY	Oh, flowers! I didn't know you were so traditional.
M	ED	I just picked them up on the way over...
F	KATHY	They're very nice. Let me get my coat.
F	KATHY	So have you always lived in L.A.?
M	ED	No. I'm from back east. You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
F	KATHY	Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
F	KATHY	Did you find it boring?
M	ED	Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines. And I listened to the radio dramas...
F	KATHY	Oh. I loved those shows! "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
M	ED	Yeah! Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street. I even started ushering there.
F	KATHY	You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw. Your friend's.
M	ED	What do you mean?
F	KATHY	"Dracula."
M	ED	That's INCREDIBLE! That's the first picture I ever saw!!
F	KATHY	That is incredible! You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
M	ED	I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
F	KATHY	A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live. I thought he was much scarier in person.
M	ED	Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date. But I think it's important that you know. I like to wear women's clothes.
F	KATHY	Huh?
M	ED	I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
F	KATHY	Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
M	ED	No! I love sex with girls.
F	KATHY	Oh. Okay.
M	ED	Okay?
F	KATHY	Okay.
M	ED (on phone)	Vampira! Hi, it's Ed Wood. Ed, I told you, I don't wanna go out!
M	ED	No, don't worry, I moved on. I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
M	VAMPIRA	Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
M	ED	It's the same film. But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon! It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out! Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming. You'll have fun!
M	TOR	My eyes are killink me.
M	ED	Don't worry. We're almost there.
M	BELA	Eddie, where are we? We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
M	CRISWELL	I predict we're lost.
M	VAMPIRA	Hey! You wanna watch the hands??
M	BELA	Sorry...
M	ED	Has anyone ever been to Downey?
M	THEATER MANAGER	Children, if you don't calm down, there won't be the entertainment.
M	ANGRY KID	It was supposed to start an hour ago!
M	TOR	My eyes are burnink.
F	KATHY	Hey look! There's the theater.
M	TOR	Where? I can't see nothink!
M	FRANTIC USHER	Thank God, you're here! They're tearing the place apart!
M	TOR	Ow.
M	FRANTIC USHER	C'mon! This way!
F	KATHY	I've never been to a premiere before.
M	ED	Wow. Go knock 'em dead!
M	ED (amplified)	Ooooo! At the stroke of midnight, the witching hour, the ghouls arise from the dead!
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	It's the blind leading the blind!
M	TOR	Dis is a nightmare.
M	CRISWELL	It's show biz.
M	BELA	What is that?
M	VAMPIRA	I think they're getting ready to burn this place down.
M	HIGH SCHOOL PUNK	Hey Vampira, how 'bout a little love?
M	VAMPIRA	Fuck off!
M	THEATER MANAGER	Children, please! Be calm!
M	ED	C'mon! We're getting the hell out of here!
M	TOR	What is happening?
M	ED	We're escaping!
M	VAMPIRA	We're gonna die.
M	ED	Stop!
F	KATHY	STOP!
M	BELA	Now that was a premiere.
M	BELA	Last night was quite a romp.
M	ED	Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
M	BELA	I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
M	ED	Yeah, she's really somethin'.
M	BELA	I know none of my wives would've.
M	BELA	Eddie, I want to thank you. These last few days have been a good time.
M	ED	I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
M	BELA	No problem. I know it by heart...
M	BELA	"Home. I have no home. Hunted... despised... living like an animal -- the jungle is my home! But I will show the world that I can be its master. I shall perfect my own race of people... a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!"
M	TOURIST	Mr. Lugosi, could I have your autograph?
M	BELA	Certainly.
M	TOURIST	Boy, that was incredible. You're just as good an actor as you always were.
M	BELA	Better. I'm seventy-four, but I don't know it. If the brain is young, then the spirit is still vigorous... like a young man.
F	KATHY	Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
M	ED	Thanks. It's actually the only thing I know how to make. Hey, can you grab that strainer?
M	ED	Ugh! Always at the wrong time. Hello?
M	ED	Oh no...
F	KATHY	What was that?
M	ED	Bela died. Whose crazy idea was it to bury him in the cape?
M	PHOTOGRAPHER #2	I heard it was in the will. It was how he wanted to be remembered.
M	VOICE	Do you want me to run it again?
M	ED	I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
F	KATHY	Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- you're not!
M	ED	I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
F	KATHY	Well you tried --
M	ED	I was a fuckin' HACK! I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives... I let Bela down...
M	REYNOLDS	Mr. Wood?! Hruphh...?
M	REYNOLDS	Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up?
M	ED	Yeah...?
M	REYNOLDS	Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
M	ED	I'm real sorry. My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
M	REYNOLDS	Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
M	ED	You could say that --
M	REYNOLDS	I'm interested in the picture business. My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
M	ED	Raising money is tough.
M	REYNOLDS	Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve...
M	ED	Okay -- you know what you do? You produce a film in a commercially proven genre. And after it's a hit, you take the profits from that, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
M	REYNOLDS	Would that work?
M	ED	Absolutely! You see this script..?
M	ED	"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's money in the bank.
M	REYNOLDS	Graverobbers from what??
M	ED	From outer space! It's science- fiction. Very big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! And pay my back rent from the profits.
M	REYNOLDS	I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
M	ED	It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
M	REYNOLDS	Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
M	ED	Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
M	REYNOLDS	Lugosi??! Didn't be pass on?
M	ED	Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
M	REYNOLDS	Just, it doesn't look like very much.
M	ED	It's plenty! It's the acorn that will grow a great oak. I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
M	ED	Bunny! We're making another film! Yeah -- I got the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills to put up the cash!
M	PAUL MARCO	Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
M	ED	Great! Bring 'em in! Bunny, I gotta run.
M	ED	Too tall... too short... And this guy doesn't work at all.
M	PAUL MARCO	Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
M	ED	That was Karloff. Paul, you gotta try harder. I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
M	ED	And by the way, keep Sunday free. The producers want all of us to get baptized.
M	ED	You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
F	KATHY	Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
M	ED	The left. It's more natural. Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb. What would that be made of?
F	KATHY	Uh, atomic energy?
M	ED	No. They're beyond that! They're smarter than the humans. What's more advanced?
F	KATHY	Dynamite --
M	ED	No, BIGGER! What's the biggest energy??
F	KATHY	The sun.
M	ED	Yes! BINGO! Solar energy! Oh that's gonna seem so scientific. This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film. No compromises.
F	KATHY	Oh my God. Look at this!
M	ED	Those assholes.
F	KATHY	The poor girl's out of a job.
M	ED	Yeah... I should give her a call.
M	ED	I'm really sorry...
M	VAMPIRA	It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist.
M	ED	I know what that's like. Anyway, I brought a copy of the script. You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
M	VAMPIRA	The Ghoul's Wife?! God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
F	KATHY	You should feel lucky. Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
M	ED	Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
M	VAMPIRA	Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
M	ED	You don't wanna be noticed?
M	VAMPIRA	Exactly. Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines? I'll do the part mute!
F	KATHY	Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom!
M	ED	Who's Dr. Tom?
F	KATHY	My chiropractor!
M	DR. MASON	Kathy, how are you?! You're looking in alignment today.
F	KATHY	Actually, my neck's a little funny.
M	ED	Wait a second. Don't move!
M	ED	It's uncanny.
M	VAMPIRA	What's uncanny?
M	ED	LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
M	TOR	He look nutink like Bela!
M	CONRAD	He's kinds got his ears.
M	TOR	You're stupid!
F	KATHY	No, cover up his face.
M	CRISWELL	Ah! Now I see it.
M	DR. MASON	"I want to suck your blood!"
M	ED	SHHH! We want these Baptists to like us.
M	REVEREND LEMON	Brothers and Sisters, we've reached a special part of the service. The baptism of our new members! If the congregation will oblige, we'd like to adjourn and reconvene at Emma DuBois's back yard.
M	CRISWELL	Why couldn't we do this in the church?
M	VAMPIRA	Because "Brother Torî couldn't fit in the sacred tub. ...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
M	ED	I do. ...Do you reject Satan and all his works?
M	BUNNY	I do.
M	REVEREND LEMON	...Do you repent for all your sins?
M	TOR	I do.
M	REYNOLDS	Oh my God, I dropped him --
M	CRISWELL	I don't think he's coming up!
M	REVEREND LEMON	Lord no! The man's drowning!
M	REYNOLDS	What do we do?!
M	REVEREND LEMON	Help! HELP!!!
M	REVEREND LEMON	Dear Jesus, please forgive us!
M	TOR	Tor make good joke!
M	VAMPIRA	This can't be the right address...
M	TOR	I am so happy! Finally I am star wit dialogue! I memorized every wordt. Eddie will be so proud!
M	REYNOLDS	Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood, we have a few questions --
M	REVEREND LEMON	The script refers on numerous occasions to graverobbing. Now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground highly offensive. It's blasphemy.
M	ED	What are you talking about?! It's the premise of the movie. It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
M	REVEREND LEMON	Mr. Wood!
M	REYNOLDS	Yes, about that title, it strikes us as very inflammatory. Why don't we change it to "Plan Nine From Outer Space"?
M	ED	That's ridiculous!
M	ED	And, ACTION! "Medicul eksaminer been aroundt yet?"
M	COP	"Just left. The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time."
M	TOR	"You get statement frumk vitnesses?"
M	COP	"Yeah, but they're pretty scared."
M	TOR	"Findink mess like dis oughta make anyone frightened. Have one of da boyz take dem back to town. You take jarge."
M	REYNOLDS	What'd you give him all the lines for?? He's unintelligible!
M	ED	Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk. Ihad to give somebody the dialogue.
M	REVEREND LEMON	That's not an answer.
M	ED	See, no talking. Isn't he good? CUE DR. TOM! Now?
M	ED	YES, NOW! LURK HIM. AND BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR FACE COVERED!
M	ED	Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives!
M	REVEREND LEMON	Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
M	ED	No, he would've loved it! Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula. CUE VAMPIRA! "Let's go down and find out whose grave it is." "Why do I always get hooked up with these spook details? Monsters! Graves! Bodies!"
M	ED	CUE THE FLYING SAUCER, RAY!
M	ED	
M	REYNOLDS	"Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know anything about the art of film production?!
M	ED	I like to think so.
M	REYNOLDS	That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
M	ED	People won't notice. Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
M	REYNOLDS	Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?! How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
M	ED	YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! Haven't you ever heard of "suspension of disbelief"?!
M	STRAPPING YOUNG MAN	Reverend, I'm here.
M	ED	Who's he?
M	REVEREND LEMON	This is our choir director. He's gonna play the young hero.
M	ED	Are you IN5ANE? I'm the director! I make the casting decisions around here!
M	REVEREND LEMON	I thought this was a group effort.
M	ED	NOOOOO!!!
M	ED	They're driving me crazy! These Baptists are stupid, stupid, STUPID!
M	ED	Mmm. I need to calm... Take deep breaths... Ohh, it's so smooth...
M	ED	Okay, everyone! Let's set up for Scene 112! Move the crypt stage left and get ready with Tor's make-up effect.
M	REVEREND LEMON	Mr. Wood? What do you think you're doing?!
M	ED	I'm directing.
M	REYNOLDS	Not like THAT, you're not!
M	REVEREND LEMON	Remove that get-up immediately. You shame our Lord.
M	ED	That's it. I give up!
M	ED	Take me to the nearest bar.
M	ED	Imperial whiskey, straight up.
M	ED	Oh my God. It's Orson Welles...
M	ED	Oh shit.
M	ED	Excuse me, Sir...?
M	ORSON WELLES	Yes?
M	ED	Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
M	ORSON WELLES	My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.
M	ED	Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
M	ORSON WELLES	Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else. But I can't find the soundtrack -- I think I left it in Malta.
M	ED	I can't believe it. These sound like my problems!
M	ORSON WELLES	It's the damn money men. You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods. And then they all think they're a director...
M	ED	Ain't that the truth! I've even bad producers recut my movies --
M	ORSON WELLES	Ugh, I hate when that happens.
M	ED	And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part!
M	ORSON WELLES	Tell me about it. I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a Mexican!
M	ED	Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
M	ORSON WELLES	It is when it works. You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch? "Kane." The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame. Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
M	ED	Wow.
M	ED	Mr. Reynolds!
M	REYNOLDS	Yes?
M	ED	We are gonna finish this film just the way I want it! Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
M	REVEREND LEMON	B-but it's our money --
M	ED	And you're gonna make a bundle. This movie's gonna be famous! But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
M	ED	ALRIGHT! ACTORS IN POSITION! LET'S FINISH THIS PICTURE!!
M	ED	Okay, I want that tank! And I want that bomb!
M	ED	NO! The aliens should look like people.
M	MAKE-UP MAN HARRY	I'm tellin' ya, aliens are always green.
M	ED	Not in my movie, they're not!
M	BUNNY	"What plan will we follow?"
M	HAMMY ALIEN	"Plan Nine."
M	BUNNY	"Plan Nine..." "Ah yes. Plan Nine deals with the resurrection of the dead."
M	ED	Maybe you guys were right. "Plan Nine" is a good title.
M	PILOT	Where's the cockpit set?
M	ED	You're standing in it. Alright, bring in the shower curtain!
M	PILOT	"So what if we develop this solarnite bomb? We'd be even a stronger nation."
M	HAMMY ALIEN	"Stronger? You see! You see!! Your stupid minds! Stupid! STUPID!"
M	PILOT	"That's all I'm taking from you."
M	CRISWELL	"Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it. For they will be from outer space."
M	ED	More fog! More fog!!
M	ED	I can't get it to go up.
F	KATHY	Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
M	ED	C'mon! Let's just go.
M	CRISWELL	You are about to see en extraordinary motion picture. But before it begins, I think we ought to give a hand to the man without whom we wouldn't be here tonight... Eddie, take a bow!
M	ED	Thanks a million. I just wanna say... this film is for Bela.
M	ED	This is the one. I know I'll be remembered for this film.
F	KATHY	Ed, I'm so happy for you.
M	ED	Let's get married.
F	KATHY	Huh?!
M	ED	Right now. Let's drive to Vegas!
F	KATHY	But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
M	ED	So? It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert. Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner. I promise.
M	CRISWELL	My friend, you have just seen the story of Edward D. Wood, Junior. Stranger than fact... and yet every incident based on sworn testimony. A man. A life. Can you prove it didn't happen?
