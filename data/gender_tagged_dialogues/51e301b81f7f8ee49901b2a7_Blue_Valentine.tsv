Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 38. It's like when two streams are flowin' down opposite sides of the mountain, mindin' their business.
M	CURTIS (V.O.)	They're doin' fine until they hit the bottom and run into one another...
M	CURTIS (V.O.)	At that point they got no choice but to become one river.
M	CURTIS (V.O.)	Sure, it's a great feeling at first, all this new water flowing together. But then you travel down a little ways and the land levels out. The current starts moving a little slower.
M	CURTIS (V.O. CONT'D)	People start drinking the water. Pissin' in it. Putting up dams to stop the flow.
M	CURTIS (V.O. CONT)	In other words, life interferes, you know. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 38A. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 39.
M	BOBBY	Hasn't anyone ever been nice to you? Don't make me give up on you...
M	CURTIS(V.O.)	And there's not too many of these rivers that'll make it all the way to the ocean without splitting off eventually. It's just nature, that's all. And instead of thinking about it you gotta just do something about it. Action, not thought.
M	DEAN	Anyone call for me?
M	DEAN (V.O.)	I just keep replaying it in my head. Thinking about other things I coulda done. Other things I coulda said.
M	DEAN (V.O.)	You wait your whole life for something to happen... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 39A. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 40. ...And you have all these ideas in your head about how you'll act and what you'll say and what you'll do, who you'll be...

M	DEAN	You gotta puke... it's the only way.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	It's the only way. It will make you feel better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it.
F	CINDY	I'm still spinning.
M	DEAN	Me too.
F	CINDY	Maybe it's just the Earth that's spinning.
M	DEAN	Yeah. We're flying. You should come visit me in the city sometime.
M	DEAN	To honesty... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 48.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Hey! Wait up.
F	CINDY	We're toasting tonight?
M	CINDY (CONT'D)	Sometimes you don't make any sense. You might as well be speaking Chinese.
M	CINDY (CONT'D)	Happy belated anniversary.
M	DEAN	How is it?
F	CINDY	Good. How did Frankie sound?
M	DEAN	Great. She's the best.
F	CINDY	She didn't sound sad?
M	DEAN	Naw. She's the champ. She's the best parts of you and the best parts of me put together. Everyday she gets more and more amazing.
F	CINDY	Daddy's little girl.
M	DEAN	She's not mine. I'm hers. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 49. I'm her father. She isn't there for me... I'm there for her. That's the way I look at it.
F	CINDY	That's beautiful.
M	DEAN	It's the choice I made when she was born.
F	CINDY	Why don't you do something...
M	DEAN	Like what?
F	CINDY	I don't know... isn't there anything you want to do?
M	DEAN	What am I supposed to want to do?
F	CINDY	I don't know... You have so many things you could do. You're good at everything. You could do anything you wanted.
M	DEAN	I just wanna be with you.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	You look like an animal right now. Your eyes look like an animal. Like a bear's eyes.
F	CINDY	Like right before the bear eats the man?
M	DEAN	Yeah... You do. It's true. That's what you look like. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 50. Whatchu thinking about?
F	CINDY	How different we are. You and me.
M	DEAN	Different?
F	CINDY	It's a good thing.
M	DEAN	You think that's good that we're different?
F	CINDY	Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way.
M	DEAN	And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you.
F	CINDY	I didn't say that. What I meant is that it's important for us to have our space. That's all. We're grown people.
M	DEAN	Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?
F	CINDY	You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab.
M	DEAN	If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything.
F	CINDY	Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 51.
M	DEAN	OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it.
F	CINDY	I think my glass has a hole in it.
M	DEAN	What's wrong with that?
F	CINDY	It's fat.
M	DEAN	That's the flavor. Eat it.
F	CINDY	I don't want to. You eat it.
M	CINDY (CONT'D)	That's going straight to your tits.
M	DEAN	My tits? I got tits?
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	I could still kick yer ass. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 52.
F	CINDY	Shiiit. I bet you a nickel you can't even beat me at arm wrestling.
M	DEAN	A dime and you're on.
F	CINDY	Ready?
M	DEAN	I'm always ready, baby.
F	CINDY	On the count of three... One... Two...

F	CINDY	I'm alright. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 53.
M	DEAN	Hold still.
F	CINDY	Ow ow ow.
M	DEAN	You think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death?
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Does it hurt?
F	CINDY	It stings a little.
M	CINDY (CONT'D)	No, no... Put me down. It's okay...
M	DEAN	Wait wait wait. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 54. To numb the pain. Doctors orders. I'm an anesthesiologist.

F	CINDY	Ew. Come on, get up.
M	DEAN	Nope, I want you to come here first. I want you to laugh.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Come close. I want to hear you... I want to tell you... Shh, come here... You want to hear a joke? OK. What's better than winning a gold medal at the Special Olympics?
F	CINDY	What?
M	DEAN	Not being retarded.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Hey...that's not funny? How come you don't think I'm funny any more? I tell you something funny. You laugh. I see you laugh. But you don't really laugh so much. You don't laugh anymore Cindy.
F	CINDY	Dean... Come on, it's time for bed.
M	DEAN	No I want to make you laugh.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Hello...
F	CINDY	You're drunk. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 56.
M	DEAN	No, I'm just still in love with you.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Do you... you want to have another baby? ... I want another child.
F	CINDY	No... Dean... Wait a second.
M	DEAN	What!? I can't have sex with my wife!?
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a little affection. Do you want me to stop loving you? Do you want me to fuck other women? Do you want me to beat you?
F	CINDY	Stop... stop... stop...
M	DEAN	Is that what you think you deserve? Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 57.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

F	CINDY	You wanna go somewhere.
M	DEAN	Sure.
F	CINDY	Where can we go?
M	CINDY (WHISPERS)	Is your roommate awake? I don't know. Let me go check.
M	DEAN (WHISPERS) (cont'd)	He's just watching TV. Do you think he's gonna come out? I don't know... Should I go see if he brushed his teeth? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 59. It's still dry.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Be quiet! Seriously. He's gonna kill me. He already hates me.
F	CINDY	You think he's gonna go to sleep now?
F	CINDY	Just a second... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 59A. Give it back!
