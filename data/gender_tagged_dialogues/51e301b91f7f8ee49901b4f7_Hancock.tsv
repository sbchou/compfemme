You want quiet, I got cotton balls you can stick in your ear. They're extra. Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue. He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt - He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT. A shoulder patch reads...

M	HORUS	It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it up with some make-up and you won't even know it's there.
M	AARON	Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.
M	HORUS	There'll always be people around who'll... exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace. Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.
M	HORUS (CONT' D)	The thing to do is... to avoid them. They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the anger... and move on. You hold the anger. I tell you because I can't take it, seeing you hurt. You're part of me. I've felt what you're feeling now. And if you've got any of me in you, you're gonna feel what I felt-when you go up against one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you do... the other cheek. You do that for me. No, you're not the coward. Not you. No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause I don't want to see you hurt. I love you. I ask you to do that for me... your old man. And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark She oversees a father-son embrace.

M	AARON	What?
M	HANCOCK	Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid. Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.
M	HANCOCK (CONT'D)	Ever curious... .what it's like? Aaron shakes his head. Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't kill you. Once. Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on

A while passes and all of a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there.., and you won't settle till your, mouth's as sweet. Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing philosophical. From manure to pure cane sugar. That's change. Today... you're a boy. Tomorrow, Mr. Penis comes knocking. Shakes your hand. Takes you for a walk... and tells you about life's simple pleasures. You're a man. And you don't look back.. You see... things evolve. Nothing is wholly inert. A step in any direction... you're walking into pockets of evolution. That is living... taking those steps. And change. Can start by changing some principles. Blank best describes Aaron's face.
M	AARON	Principles?
M	HANCOCK	Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do. I look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go clean. Not good. That's a formula for future abuse... an invitation to the loser's dance. Letting it go. Walking away. Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide.
M	AARON	What am I suppose to do?
M	HANCOCK	You do what is necessary.
M	AARON	I wanted... there were three of them.
M	HANCOCK	What is necessary. Let me tell you something, kid. There was this infantry unit, you see... badly outnumbered. Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A fox and he's walking through what, the woods, the forests, right? Next thing the fox knows, he's staring down a pack of... hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this chase, the fox's running his ass off, over boulders and through streams and, but the damn hounds are still on his tail. Finally the fox comes to this cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds are closing in and they're going to tear him to pieces. So what does he think... "I jump and I die for sure. I stay, confront them and I'll get my ass butchered." Decision time. He thinks, "stay and least I'd have something, a chance. To slip away, maybe." The fox decides to go down fighting, make a stand. Right? The hounds come. What do you think happens?
M	AARON	He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.
M	HANCOCK	No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric.
M	AARON	What're you saying?
M	HANCOCK	But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise. It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets up close. To hear what he's saying. You know what the fox's saying... just before he keels off? Aaron - negative. Now he's gurgling, choking on his own blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying next to his entrails, you know... and you know what he says? "No regrets."
M	AARON	What?
M	HANCOCK	No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And "no regrets." Aaron - submitting it to memory.
M	AARON	Why're you telling me all this?
M	HANCOCK	Look at it this way... I got to do what I got to do. Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother. She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms. He begins to stir, wrestling some unseen dream. He wakes, in His name tag reads - DR. HOLE.
M	DR. HOLE	at the Hole Institute, our experienced staff and cutting-edge technology means you need not spend another day in discomfort from hemorrhoidal flare-ups. Also, for anal fissures, warts, and secondary yeast infections, the institute is your complete rectal service clinic. And remember, I'm not just the Hole Institute spokesperson. I'm also a client.

M	HANCOCK	I'm sorry. I came in to... hope you like chicken. Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He for dinner. She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there on her sofa. A calm, while they stare. And then... Table's done. Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.
F	MARY	Glasses. Geez. Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
F	MARY	You know Hancock?
M	AARON	He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.
M	HANCOCK	Man of the house?
F	MARY	Which piece would you like?
M	HANCOCK	Breasts, please. Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.
M	AARON	You want milk?
M	HANCOCK	No. It gives me gas. Thank you. A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.
M	AARON	It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and above. She picks up the fork. Horus - a chicken leg dangling from his lips, in mid-chew,.
M	AARON (CONT'D)	Good arm.
M	HANCOCK	not about the labor... or the love of it. .It's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you. The gift of might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man... because I can. Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are Horus, the quiet observer, observes. so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about... essence. The essence of the man... not his clothes. It's the job. Take away the arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions but not his trade, his profession. That case, you strip him of what he is... a man. Horus a firm grasp of the concept.
M	HANCOCK (CONY' D)	What line of work are you in, Mr. Longfellow?
M	HORUS	Oh, it's not like you... what you do or anything. A department store over on Third.
F	MARY	Horus is in the securities business.
M	HORUS	I'm a security guard. I'm just... Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge.
F	MARY	It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors.
M	HORUS	It's a night job. I sit around.
M	HANCOCK	You're a security guard. You keep the state of things. It's a job. You do it. We're in the same business. Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle. A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
M	HANCOCK (CONT'D)	Aaron, could you show me the restroom? Aaron points first door in the hall.
M	AARON	On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.
M	AARON (CONT' D)	What do you think, mom?
F	MARY	Horus, what do I do?
M	HORUS	I need to get ready.
M	AARON	mom?
F	MARY	What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of from which it is generated. The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
M	HANCOCK	and you could see the flames, through the storm... I get there, the vessel's all over, spread across three miles of South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive was the captain, up against a buoy... crying 'cause he didn't go down with his men... and he's got to live with it. Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard in a parking lot a couple months after. A good man... . did what he had to do. A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
M	AARON	I wanted to kill him.
F	MARY	Aaron.
M	AARON	I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up... like I can't even move.
F	MARY	He comes home crying.
M	AARON	Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off. No... there's no shame in it. The crying. It's relief... we're older and we don't remember when... we go, "God, when was the last time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an effort, now. Takes more pain... more blood. Like it's, do you have the time anymore? Even to look back and recall a moving experience. To be moved. By rage. Hurt. By love. But if you have to remember the last time something touched you... you've missed it - you've forgotten how to cry. Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose nature he has yet to comprehend. Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door. Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.
M	HORUS	Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't want to interfere. I have work.
F	MARY	Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.
M	HORUS	It's all right, Mary. I'm late.
F	MARY	No, I'll make it right now.
M	HORUS	I don't have time. I'll grab some on the way. Thanks. Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free. I don't want to interrupt. Please don't let me stop you.
M	HANCOCK	No, I need to go. The last time I had a meal... an evening like this, I was... it was too long ago. I appreciate your kindness. Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime. Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
M	HANCOCK	Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll drop by after school. See how you're doing. Yeah. Horus watches this - his son slipping away. The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first. Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and wild. We just .don't know. I'm this way. Hancock points the opposite way.
M	HANCOCK	Need a lift?
M	HORUS	It's a short walk. Acknowledged. An awkward beat while they stare at each other... . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge A frazzled Korean woman, SOON-YI (60) watches over HOLLY (19), Officer Rutger and Adams sip Joe in the corner booth. bleeding heart dyke, I know not what. Fuck martyrdom. Bottom line, Sheila won't put out...
M	RUTGER	No.

M	RUTGER	D'fuck she know? Shit smears, man.
M	ADAMS	Games. I don't need it.
M	RUTGER	Fuck games, fuck dames.
M	ADAMS	I got a'wife, I don't need the aggravation...
M	RUTGER	Take a donut hole. The entrance. Horus wanders in, lost in this environment. He
M	HORUS	A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it.
M	ADAMS (O.S.)	Longfellow.
M	HORUS	How are you, John? Frank?
M	ADAMS	Observe anything worth recording, lately?
M	HORUS	You know... things are slow.
M	RUTGER	Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got hit on Thursday.
M	ADAMS	The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of meat.
M	RUTGER	Anything go wrong, you make sure you notify us, the authorities. No heroics without a license. You know the procedure. Horus - he knows the procedure.
M	ADAMS	Of course he does.
M	RUTGER	Of course. Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of
M	SOON-YI	He no have gun. Not copper.
M	HOLLY	Oh, I thought...
M	SOON-YI	He regular guy. Sixty-five cents for regular.guy. Horus - somebody shoot him.
F	MARY	What're you doing? She's taken by this scene.
M	AARON	Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.
F	MARY	About him?
M	AARON	No. Not really. Are you?
F	MARY	No. They're lying through their collective teeth.
M	AARON	Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow.
F	MARY	Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better...
M	AARON	I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible? Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the

The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the He clasps.-his ears - tormented.
M	ROHEIM	Olga... He snaps out of it... .bitch. Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.
M	HORUS	Another dream?'
M	ROHEIM	I was talking again, huh? No response.
M	ROHEIM	. that look on her face, you know the look, when she's almost there... makes you feel like a man. Then everything gets blurry and all of a sudden, it's not my arm that's around her and it's not my hand that's touching her and it's not even me, my body. Some guy, this good-looking guy... he looks like the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And so... the Marlboro Man's running his fingers through her hair. And he's... banging her... and her knees... by her ears, you know? And that look on her face. That look.
M	HORUS	Roheim. Bitch.
M	HORUS	Come on.
M	ROHEIM	Walk with me. Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde. Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger. She seizes
F	MARY	Have a good one.
M	AARON	I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious. We soar through air and mist. Circle a street below. Hover over Out of an alley and into the street - Hancock, trenchcoated, Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown Not a word from Horus. This stuff's going to kill me. He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig. You disapprove, I know.
M	HORUS	No.
M	ROHEIM	Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink... to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it... you take everything.
M	HORUS	No.
M	ROHEIM	You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative. So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp.
M	HORUS	You shouldn't drink.
M	ROHEIM	My wife. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I drink to kill-the taste. Horus has no response to this. You're a good man, Horus... And you're right. This stuff's no good. It's a coward's way out and I know it. He gives the bottle a guilty stare. Tosses the bottle into a
M	ROHEIM (CONY' D)	What the hell. I can learn to love beverage.
M	Mary. Walking.	Hancock. Following. From across the street. Mesmerized and in a world to himself. He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS 200 lbs. of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window - Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
M	HANCOCK	How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of Hancock shrugs a smiles. There to make it worse - Clyde. He's back, getting at the sports A sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus. He approaches the steps with fire and...

F	MARY	What were you doing in the street? You ripped it pretty good. Hancock - he's lost. What're you:.. how old's this thing?
M	HANCOCK	didn't see it coming... left myself open.
F	MARY	It'll be all right.
M	HANCOCK	All right?
F	MARY	It's just the seams. I can sew it back.
M	HANCOCK	What?
F	MARY	This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it.
M	HANCOCK	You'll sew -it?
F	MARY	Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one. Are you okay? No reply. He stares at her - simply. There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
F	MARY	Let's see.
M	HANCOCK	You have to be quick.
F	MARY	Come on, I want to see.
M	HANCOCK	If you blink, you'll miss it. Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white Mary reaches for it. Too late.
F	MARY	I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
M	MARY (CONY' D)	The water is dirty.
M	HANCOCK	I'm sorry.
F	MARY	It's not your fault. Hancock looks away. You're tense.
M	HANCOCK	I've been tired, lately.
F	MARY	You should slow down. Rest.
M	HANCOCK	-So people tell me.
F	MARY	It must be hard.
M	HANCOCK	Hard?
F	MARY	To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest.
M	HANCOCK	It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for... it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare... the totality of fear itself... that it's all been a bad dream? That it's safe? That is relief. The infant in my arms... to the hysterical mother. When you can see her face, what's rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."
F	MARY	Where... who are you?
M	HANCOCK	It's not important who I am, Mary. Or what... where I'm from. It doesn't matter. I'm a man. I am every man.
F	MARY	You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do.
M	HANCOCK	Why... do you say that?
F	MARY	It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere... I mean, maybe it's something about you but... it must be hard on you sometimes. Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer. But probably not... probably..
M	HANCOCK	Yes... sometimes. Mary allows the moment to sink in.
F	MARY	So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street? I was lost... . but I think I'm ok, now. He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER Erlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness. Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat. From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he " before long, you're running, looking for a place to hide." they scale it. Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
M	PERCEVAL	Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
M	PERCEVAL (CONT'D)	What's up? What? Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
M	PERCEVAL (CONT'D)	I just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.
M	PERCEVAL (CONT'D)	Don't bother. He's mine. No biting. I hate biting.
M	SPENGLER	Kick his ass, Percy. Do him, Percy. He's your woman.
M	PERCEVAL	Let's go. Let's have it. While we're still kids. Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.
M	PERCEVAL (CONT'D)	Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent little gonad. Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny, purple-headed shlongs the size of... All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose. And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
M	ERLICK	He's yours.
M	SPENGLER	Save some for us. Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine. He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
M	ERLICK	What's he doing?
M	SPENGLER	Kick his ass, Percy. Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
M	ERLICK	That's cold.
M	SPENGLER	Kill him, Percy. Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral Aaron - to pee or not to pee... ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.
M	AARON	Don't mess with me. He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
F	MARY	You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.
M	HORUS	Just get in? Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
F	MARY	Nick's market. Are you sick?
M	HORUS	I can't sleep. She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms Horus tilts his head away from her hand.
M	HORUS (CONT'D)	Please, Mary.
F	MARY	You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that?
M	HORUS	No thank you. Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up
F	MARY	Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
M	HORUS	He'll take him home?
F	MARY	Yes.
M	HORUS	What do we know about this man? The papers... they don't have all the facts about him.
F	MARY	What facts? He's not a hero.
M	HORUS	Yes. A hero. I know that...
F	MARY	Aaron likes him. I know that maybe, I've been neglectful... that I haven't been there... Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair. I'm trying... you have to know... I'd like to be more... involved. Like it used to be. Before we moved here.
M	HORUS (CONT' D)	Are you going somewhere?
F	MARY	No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.
M	MARY (CONT' D)	All right. Try to get some sleep. With that, she's out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
M	AARON	.o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - I said, "don't mess with me." Just like that. "Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie... he said that?
F	MARY	All right, already. How's your mouth?
M	AARON	It doesn't hurt, I told you. He saw everything from the roof. Said I did what I had to do. Aaron, tomorrow...
M	AARON	He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again...
M	HORUS	I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I pick you.
M	AARON	God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard. Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
F	MARY	Hold still.
M	AARON	I like it long.
F	MARY	Shut up. Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his realize he's there. Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.
M	MARY (CONT'D)	Horus?
M	AARON	it's almost eight. Dad's late.
F	MARY	Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
M	AARON	like this? How do you make a fist?
F	MARY	Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
M	MARY (CONT'D)	Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it. ) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur
M	HANCOCK	What?
F	MARY	Your hair. Come on, have a seat.
M	AARON	Mom's going butcher your hair.
F	MARY	Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n homework.
M	AARON	Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock. Hancock shrugs a "what can I do." Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I got to do. Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
M	Hancock.	Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
F	MARY	There... my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely. How do you like it?
M	HANCOCK	Nice. Thank you. Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...
F	MARY	I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there... in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money.
M	HANCOCK	He was in the-police academy? A pause.
F	MARY	His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove... the validation of his manhood. It tpok everything out of him. He didn't talk for days after he was cut. He took it real hard. I mean, still, he's not... I mean,, he's still... .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I understand that I'm not intolerant of it, the working-through process. It's just that, sometimes... sometimes, I need his strength. I miss. the strength.
M	HANCOCK	Is that what you want?
F	MARY	Want?
M	HANCOCK	What you need?
F	MARY	The hair... I need to... She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.
M	HANCOCK	Mary?
F	MARY	Yes? You ever been down the boardwalk, at night?
F	MARY	Why... what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
M	AARON (O.S.)	Mom? Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
F	MARY	Yes. Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!
M	AARON	my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls.
F	MARY	All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...
M	MARY (CONT' D)	You're leaving?
M	HANCOCK	It's getting late.
F	MARY	I'm sorry.
M	HANCOCK	I'm going to take a walk.
F	MARY	Really? On the boardwalk?
M	HANCOCK	Maybe. Pause. Mom.'
F	MARY	I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he Good night, Mary.
F	MARY	Good night. The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
F	MAN	I wear dresses. How about you?
M	HANCOCK	Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
F	GINA	Meet you outside. The El Camino, right? The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
M	GINA (CONT'D)	Your eyes are calm. It's good. She withdraws her hands.
M	HANCOCK	What?
F	GINA	But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit...
M	GINA (CONT'D)	Nice haircut. Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the . as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
M	HORUS	Dear God. Horus catches him. A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.
M	HORUS	Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
M	ROHEIM	Figured I can get you by the front... but you weren't there.
M	HORUS	Who... what happened?
M	ROHEIM	They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and his boys. They were waiting on me. Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.
M	HORUS	Why didn't you come through the back... standing out there in the dark?
M	ROHEIM	-Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped them'in the fight. Shit... He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.
M	HORUS	What're you doing?
M	ROHEIM	the old man Look at what they did.. gave a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for shit. Sit down Could you knock it off, please. so I can clean the cuts. He leads the old wretch back to the chair.
M	ROHEIM	I'm a waste of time...
M	HORUS	Stop.
M	ROHEIM	I'm too old for this.
M	HORUS	You're not old.
M	ROHEIM	What am I... I'm biologically challenged. Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.
M	I	Use to be, I blame the job. The job. think, bullshit job. Not right for a man. "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for the hell is DIo nly dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the carpet. Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it. But you know what, Horus. That's all wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't make the man. It's me. Not the uniform. It starts right here... 'cause I can't do anything right. Fuck up my ABC's. But you. Why do you put up with this crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for you at home. Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.
M	HANCOCK	got to do what you got to do. He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns... A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-

M	ROHEIM	They're going to can me.

M	AARON	The toast's burnt.
F	MARY	What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.
M	AARON	We're late... you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
F	MARY	Eat... and we'll go. Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.
M	AARON	You forgot the corn... . ouch!
F	MARY	I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry.
M	AARON	You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.
M	ROHEIM	Shoes. The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.
M	HORUS	You're going to be okay?
M	ROHEIM	I don't know. You might have solo act tomorrow night.
M	HORUS	Get some sleep.
M	ROHEIM	You're a good man, Horus.
M	HORUS	I have to get home, now. I'll call. Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.
M	ROHEIM	You know what Olga said before she walked out on me? Her last words to me. She turned at the front door. Looked around the room and she says, "keep it clean." That's it, can you believe it? Then out the door. But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place spotless... in case she walks through that door one day. I don't think she's coming back. He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands, On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth. He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand. ï¿½ow He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed The door opens. And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.
M	CLYDE	The box scores are waiting and I got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make it snappy.
M	HORUS	I'd like my sports page, please.
M	CLYDE	You what?
M	HORUS	I want you to stop taking my sports page.
M	CLYDE	All right. Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck. He stutter-steps... KNOCKS... What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop taking your sports page. Now get out of here and let me... I want today's sports page.
M	CLYDE	You what?
M	HORUS	That there... my sports page.
M	CLYDE	What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden? You don't even like football. Horus does.not budge. You'll get it back... after I take my dump. Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
M	HORUS	No.
M	CLYDE	What?
M	HORUS	No. I would like my sports page now. Please.
M	CLYDE	After I finish.
M	HORUS	I'd prefer it now.
M	CLYDE	What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy? Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm Give that back. Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's Why'd you go and do that for? Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the He simply tears into Horus...

M	AARON	You're acting weird.
F	MARY	What?
M	AARON	I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.
M	HORUS	Mary! A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a while, one would suspect. Come back here! Stop him! In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
M	COP (CONT'D)	Stop him! Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.
M	HORUS	Drink. The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance. Is this a bar... or what? Drink. Please. clouds - they're alive, restless. She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.
M	HANCOCK	Hi. Thank you for being here.
F	MARY	Is everything all right? Hancock has no response. What's wrong?
M	HANCOCK	It's cold. Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together. They're moving. The turbulence has started.
F	MARY	Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
M	HANCOCK	Look out there and what do you see, Mary? Nothing. I don't know... I don't see anything.
M	HANCOCK	see it,can It's out there. But you can't Y nu? And that's good, not seeing. But for me, I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out there.
F	MARY	Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?
M	HANCOCK	Duty. You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you. He'll say: "you do what you have to do." Or what? You let the next guy do it for you, if you don't... if you can't. And... but. If I can't, then who?
M	HANCOCK (CONT'D)	The next guy? No. There is no "I can't." Just "I must." Mary - watching a grown superman unravel. But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't question it. This is me. I'm it. I do what I have to do. I get in there.., all the killing... the blood... and I deal with it. I clean up. I make things right. And. But when.., where does it end? Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's everywhere. And it stays. All that I can do, Mary. The things I am capable of doing, I can't blink away the hell I've seen. It's in me... in here and I can't not think about it. It's in me. It's me.
F	MARY	Hancock... what...
M	HANCOCK	I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll break. I need to get away. Get away to where? I don't know. I need your help.
F	MARY	Me? What can I do? What do you want me to do?
M	HANCOCK	I want you to save me.
F	MARY	How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing Don ' t. Save me.
F	MARY	I can't.
M	HANCOCK	You can.
M	AND	Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron. what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't know what I'm doing... what I'm saying anymore. I'm married. A pause.
M	HANCOCK	To whom?
F	MARY	I love him. The death blow.
M	HANCOCK	No. Unacceptable.
F	MARY	I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console... but what can she do?
M	HANCOCK	I'm cold. Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.
F	MARY	I'm sorry. She leaves. He swings into the BOYS ROOM.
M	PLOP.	And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles Guess who? Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head. Introduces it to the yellowed waters below. SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says... "Don't mess with me." They leave - laughing.
M	THEM (CONT'D)	Little shit. Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl. She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
F	MARY	Horus... soiled in disgrace. He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No Aaron waits, hopeful. in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
M	SUE	Hymie. Come down, Hymie. She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by. Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the tree. Hancock's reaction - "what?" My pussycat. She won't come down. She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
M	SUE (CONT'D)	Holy fuck. Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky. He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley. Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something stiff up his ass.
M	REED	What do we have here? A piece of shit. A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that superguy. Hancock stares at him. Fuck off. He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.
M	A	Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
M	AARON	Hi.
M	HANCOCK	What're you doing here?
M	AARON	I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd... be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.
M	HANCOCK	I don't know what you're talking about.
M	AARON	Where are you going? Can I go?
M	HANCOCK	You don't want to go where I'm going.
M	AARON	Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today... and you said you'd pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He's upset now.
M	HANCOCK	Listen. Aaron recoils. Listen. I'm not here to save you.
M	HANCOCK (CONT'D)	No, not my job. Don't put that on me. Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal with it, kid. You are what you are and... what I say, it won't do you any change. You'll grow up to be just like-your old man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can do about it... 'cept grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming's gentle. Aaron backs away from his angry wrath. That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not here to save you. He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.
M	This empty bar.	With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's One.more. Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...
M	HORUS (CONT'D)	No... nevermind. Where's your bathroom?
M	JOEY	Bathroom's closed. Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.
M	HORUS	How much. Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you what. I'll take care of this one.
M	HORUS	Thank you.
M	JOEY	The register ain't open yet, anyhow. Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
M	JOEY (CONT'D)	Shit. At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all her glory.
F	GINA	I've been waiting. They stare for one horny beat. Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
F	GINA	Come on, baby. Relax.
M	HANCOCK	I can't.
F	GINA	You can. The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.
M	HANCOCK	I can't.
F	GINA	Let it go, baby. Just let it...
M	HANCOCK	I can't. His arm rips through the glass...
F	GINA	. go. Oh god.
M	HANCOCK	I can't! He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'
F	GINA	Don't give up, now. He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky. They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound. Between them - a ketchup bottle. The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
M	HORUS	Son. Go to your room. Struggles to his knees.
F	MARY	What happened toyou?
M	AARON	Dad, are you wasted?
F	MARY	Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room.
M	AARON	He is wasted. Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
M	HORUS	Aaron. Go to your room.
M	AARON	But dad... Go! Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.
M	MARY (CONT' D)	What do you think you're doing, Horus Longfellow? Horus gauges her.
M	HORUS	Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm not your child. I'm your husband.
F	MARY	Horus, what're you talking about? Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength. But you didn't know-about me... Mary knows where this is headed. You didn't know I was going to do this to you. I guess I should've known. We were married and I knew... at the reception. I couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and I watched you dance. In your white dress. And I remember zoning out... for a second, just watching you. God, Mary... the little girl next door who used to get into fist fights with her brothers in those patched-up Toughskins. We met only 'cause the tallest tree in the neighborhood was in my backyard and you needed to climb it. But that night. God, you looked so beautiful I.had to realize it... how much I loved you... one more time. You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I remember I'm watching you there, with him... together like that. You looked good with him, I thought all of a sudden. Like you belong... better. And as I stared across the floor, it was the same story with all the guys there, that they were more right for you. More right because that night, you walked in with the wrong man.
F	MARY	Why do you say that?
M	HORUS	Because I let you down. I'm a coward. I can't do anything about it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd have to defend you and Aaron. What do I do, then? What am I if I can't do that... my own wife, family? Not a man.
F	MARY	are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure... the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of. I went w through it...,I was there when the hurt came, when the academy said no. I there.

M	HAN000K	I need a cigarette.
M	VOICE	You what? But you haven't...
M	HANCOCK	I need a cigarette, goddamn it! He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.
M	VOICE	I don't smoke. What's wrong with you? She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
F	REPORTER	What're you doing? And in disgust, he swipes EVERYTHING off the sink.

F	MARY	What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her.
M	HANCOCK	It's the haircut, Mary. I'm pissed! Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him.
M	AARON	Don't you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...
M	HANCOCK	Shut your mouth. He swats the kid off his back.
M	AARON	Don't touch her you bastard!
M	HANCOCK	You're getting on my nerves.
F	MARY	Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes
M	AARON	No! Mom!

M	SCARPO	He's dead, man.
M	THUG #2	Fuck, we're dead! What, now?
M	RUTGERS	You did the right thing, Longfellow. I saw four. Presumably armed. Only other way out is through the back. The cops trade laughs.
M	RUTGERS	Take a hike, Longfella. Get back in your hole and watch the law kick some ass. Horus, reluctant, returns inside his building. Rutgers moves to work the speakers - his action preempted by the

M	SCARPO	He ain't coming back? In unison - their FLASHLIGHTS flick on. Rutgers and Adams arrive. They take position next to fellow
M	ADAMS	What's with the Cap? Looks like someone just fucked his wife, or something. Nervous smiles from the fellas. Horus sneaks in, heads for the second floor.

M	RUTGERS	Does he know anything else?
M	TED (O.S.)	Come on out! Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves. He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of healing. Hancock closes in - corners her.
F	MARY	Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his
M	MARY (CONT' D)	No...
M	HANCOCK	Please... A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.
M	HANCOCK	Help me.
M	TED (O.S.)	All HELL'S going to break loose! Hancock recoils from this noise - in veritable pain. Clutches
M	HANCOCK	Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him
M	TED (0. S)	You are surrounded. There's no way out of this one... NO WAY OUT! Hancock on his knees, tears bubbling inside. He shakes it off.
M	HANCOCK	No... do what I got to do. He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through... Ted Brock - a picture of grim impatience, breathing hard.
M	TED	I want his balls in a jar... Chad. The others. They take a good look at him.
M	TED (CONT' D)	in a fucking vice... this is the END of the line. He drops to a squat, searching for calm.
F	MARY	I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond. You're fighting a lot, right now. I know that. They're out there waiting for you. It's like... sometimes.., you feel like the world's waiting for you. Expecting. What's your next move, they want to know... there's NO ESCAPE! and the responsibility. The duty. You can't shrug it off. I know that. And I'm sorry. Hancock - a committed stare into space. Can he hear her? Maybe... if you knew that, that I know. And. That I won't expect anything from you. And... there doesn't have to be a next move. Hancock turns on this. Stares at her. He rises from the crouch. He approaches. Stands before her. He reaches back... and removes his CAPE. He covers Mary, gently There is no eye contact. Signal acknowledged. The Rifleman loads his piece...
M	TED	Where the fuck is Chopper Three? This is a hostage situation, Cap. We've got a woman in there.
M	TED	Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon. I want that bastard in a body bag. Ted waves a "go-when-ready" sign. The Rifleman steadies his high- Hancock REACTS, the chaos throbbing inside his head. And like He BURSTS out of the building - eyes lit with the Hell inside.
M	HANCOCK	Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of He stares at them all, invincible.
M	AARON	Let me go you bastard.
F	OFFICER	Let go, you little asabite. Aaron spots Horus in the hallway...
M	AARON	Dad! He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.
M	AARON (CONT' D)	I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to do...
F	OFFICER	Mr. Longfellow...
M	AARON.	He's got mom, dad. He came and took her away. What do we do, now? Horus - he hasn't a clue. On the TV - a graphic depiction of war at Killybegs.
F	OFFICER	There's not much you can do. We've got every man out there, already. I suggest you take your son some place safe. Let us do our jobs.
M	HORUS	Mary...
M	AARON	I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.
F	OFFICER	I have to go... they need me. He exits. Roheim enters, out of breath. He notices the nasty, gaping hole
M	HORUS	He's got Mary, Roheim. I got to get her.
M	ROHEIM	What do you mean, you got to get her?
M	HORUS	I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up at his father - "did he just say that?"
M	AARON	Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. "What can I do?"
M	ROHEIM	Brain damage runs in this family or something? Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness.
M	AARON	Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the bloodhounds? A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only thing they can do, and it's worthless. And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance. First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning dismantling of future law enforcement.
M	HANCOCK	Go away!
M	HORUS	Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be here.
M	ROHEIM	I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. Aaron ducks into his father's chest. Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building. From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble, A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun Hancock returns. He's pumped, deranged, and he's lost that loving feeling.
F	MARY	What have you dome?
M	HANCOCK	I made them go away.
M	HORUS (O.S.)	Mary! Mary responds to her name like a body to sugar. Horus!
M	HANCOCK	The noise... Mary!
F	MARY	Horus!
M	HANCOCK	Why?!
F	MARY	Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him. It'll never go away. Hancock responds to "it." If you've got anything left... inside... and you do, I know you do... whatever it was that you felt for me... inside... then you won't go out there. He just looks at her. Just let go... and it'll go away. Please, just let go. I can't. And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the
M	HANCOCK	You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock Horus disappears inside.
M	HANCOCK (CONT' D)	Come out, you little shit. A pause in action - no reply from Horus.
M	HANCOCK (CONT'D)	Are you a man?! Horus answers... He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS brick structure.
M	HORUS	Fuck you. Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does street. Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way.
