M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	This is Harvey Milk speaking on Friday November 18th. This is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination... REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	During one of the early campaigns, I started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature...
M	HARVEY MILK	Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you.
M	HARVEY MILK	If I was speaking to a slightly hostile or mostly straight audience, I'd try to break the tension with a joke...
M	HARVEY MILK	I know, I know, I'm not what you were expecting, but I left my high heels at home. Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.
M	HARVEY MILK	I fully realize that a person who stands for what I stand for - an activist, a gay activist - becomes the target or potential target for a person who is insecure, terrified, afraid or very disturbed themselves... A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly
M	DIANNE FEINSTEIN	As President of the Board of Supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot... and killed. GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.
M	DIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D)	Police are looking for a suspect... Supervisor Dan White.
M	DAN WHITE	Something has happened. She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She
M	HARVEY MILK	Knowing that I could be assassinated at any moment, I feel it's important that some people should understand my thoughts. I think that-- I wish I had time to explain everything I did. Almost everything that was done was done with an eye on the gay movement.
M	HARVEY MILK	Hey. I'm Harvey.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Okay, Harvey...
M	HARVEY MILK	Today's my birthday. No, today is actually my birthday. Well, tonight. At midnight.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Really?
M	HARVEY MILK	And, believe it or not, I don't have any plans. People took me out after work...
M	SCOTT SMITH	Work? So, that would be... Let me guess. Ma Bell or AT&T.;
M	HARVEY MILK	The Great American Insurance Company. I'm part of the big, evil, corporate establishment that, let me guess, you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from Vietnam to diaper rash.
M	SCOTT SMITH	You left out bad breath. Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
M	HARVEY MILK	So... You're not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you?
M	SCOTT SMITH	Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute for a suit... But I don't do guys over forty.
M	HARVEY MILK	Well then, I'm in luck.
M	SCOTT SMITH	How's that?
M	HARVEY MILK	Because I'm still thirty-nine... And it's only eleven-fifteen. OPERA MUSIC PLAYS on a record player. (Wagner's Tristan and
M	HARVEY MILK	Where are you from?
M	SCOTT SMITH	Jackson, Mississippi.
M	HARVEY MILK	Well, this isn't Jackson, but you still can't respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform. It's too dangerous.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Now you tell me.
M	HARVEY MILK	There's nothing tougher than a New York City cop. They're arrogant, and they're everywhere. I'll show you the cruising spots, if you want, if you promise you'll be careful... little Scottie-san.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Are you on uppers or what?
M	HARVEY MILK	No. This is just... plain old me.
M	SCOTT SMITH	You're afraid of the cops?
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm just discreet. I know a lot of people here. If they found out, I could lose my job.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Oh. You're one of "those." I think you need a change of scenery. New friends.
M	HARVEY MILK	I need a change.
M	SCOTT SMITH	You're forty now.
M	HARVEY MILK	Forty years old and I haven't done a thing I'm proud of.
M	SCOTT SMITH	You keep eating like this and you'll be a fat ass by fifty.
M	HARVEY MILK	No. Don't you worry. I won't make it to fifty. Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Why don't we run away together?
M	SCOTT SMITH	Where to?
M	HARVEY MILK	In those days, San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go... To drop out... To fall in love... through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The new place for us refugees was this run down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six blocks square... The Castro. Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:
M	SCOTT SMITH	I cashed my last unemployment check yesterday...
M	HARVEY MILK	Well, I hope you did something useful with it.
M	SCOTT SMITH	I bought an ounce of pot. I was just wondering if you had any plans, or thoughts... About us doing something to, you know, bring in an income.
M	HARVEY MILK	Don't move. Harvey straddles Scott. He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.
M	SCOTT SMITH	I suppose I can wait tables.
M	HARVEY	No way. I want you right here with me... Did you see place downstairs is for rent?
M	SCOTT SMITH	Yeah.
M	HARVEY MILK	I was thinking we could open a shop together.
M	SCOTT SMITH	What kind of shop?
M	HARVEY MILK	One with very little overhead. Not too much work... A little one, just like Morris and Minnie Milk of Woodmere, New York...
M	HARVEY MILK	Just a little to the left... The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.
M	MCCONNELLY	You're the new renters?
M	HARVEY MILK	Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera. Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	I want to join the, um... What is it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's Association. I want to help in any way possible. I'm no interloper. A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll forgive that. McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.
M	MCCONNELLY	I don't think your application will be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a family neighborhood. Your kind are far more welcome on Haight street.
M	HARVEY MILK	What "kind" do you mean, sir?
M	MCCONNELLY	The Merchant's Association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Based on what law?
M	MCCONNELLY	There's man's law and there's God's law in this neighborhood and in this City. The San Francisco Police force is happy to enforce either.
M	HARVEY MILK	Thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood!
M	SCOTT SMITH	We pay taxes you know! Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from
M	HARVEY MILK	We'll form our own business association! Start with the gay- owned businesses... We'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film. We'll ask them what they want to see done here... what they want changed... We'll get money rolling into this neighborhood. Revitalize it...
M	SCOTT SMITH	Can I come in now?
M	HARVEY MILK (O.S.)	One more minute! I'll go to the neighborhood banks. They must have some gay customers.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey. What's with all this political activist crap? I thought you were a goddamn Republican. Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm a businessman, Scott. I think businesses ought to treat their customers right. Even their gay customers. For God's sake, this is San Francisco!
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey. It's just like every other city in this country. People hate us. Big surprise.
M	HARVEY MILK	We should have at least one block in one city right? Start there and take over the neighborhood. Okay, you can come in now! Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
M	SCOTT SMITH	Wow. This is-- Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback.
M	HARVEY MILK	Happy birthday! Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about, Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.
M	MAN ON THE STREET	Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!
M	HARVEY MILK	Thanks for joining the Castro Village Association! Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Excuse me gentleman... ladies. Hello! Mr. McConnelly! McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	I just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing.
M	MCCONNELLY	Fine.
M	HARVEY MILK	So you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you? McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly here loves our kind. Spend away! Tell your wife Hello for me. Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
M	HARVEY MILK	And people started hanging around our store. Not customers. Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from home...
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute art student who I'd picked up at Toad Hall. Turns out he was also good at running the Camera Shop... something Scott and I found we had surprising little interest in... ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.
M	DANNY NICCOLETTA	Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about street theater, now.
M	HARVEY MILK	What you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions... Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great wit. A Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the Castro... including himself. JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And somewhere along the line Jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from Wisconsin... Dick Pabich... And of course there was Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids... DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And on occasion we actually had a real customer. But only occasionally. ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey... This guy wants to talk to you.
M	HARVEY MILK	Welcome. What can we do for you?
M	ALLAN BAIRD	Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters representative, and Director of the Coors beer boycott in California.
M	HARVEY MILK	Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's a very big deal, so behave yourselves.
M	ALLAN BAIRD	I was told you were like the Mayor of the Castro, said you organized the CVA, you might know some people in the bars.
M	HARVEY MILK	I do have friends in awfully low places, but just so you know, it's not official yet.
M	ALLAN BAIRD	What's that?
M	HARVEY MILK	The Mayor part. I've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to City Hall and secede, but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans. But if I could be of any use, I'm all ears!
M	ALLAN BAIRD	We can't get Coors to go union. These guys are like me, they can't be out of work too long. Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm just curious. Are we your first stop or your last?
M	ALLAN BAIRD	It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.
M	HARVEY MILK	Well, you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer. If we're going to fast for your sake, I think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight, don't you? Is that what you really want?
M	HARVEY MILK	And allies. I'll have Coors out of every bar in the Castro by the end of the week. Deal?
M	ALLAN BAIRD	Thank you Mr. Milk. JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back behind
M	HARVEY MILK	No more Coors beer. It's gotta come out of every bar. Gay and straight.
M	SCOTT SMITH	What's he giving you?
M	HARVEY MILK	Nothing for me. That's a convert.
M	SCOTT SMITH	A convert to what?
M	HARVEY MILK	The cause.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	I got "my people" to get Coors out of all the Gay Bars. 30 million bottles worth in San Francisco alone. Coors beer immediately fell from number 1. They caved. One week later, union man Allan Baird hired the first ever openly gay union boys to drive Teamsters trucks... We weren't just a group of pansies anymore. We had a neighborhood. We had the unions. And for the first time, we had a little bit of power.
M	HARVEY MILK	Maybe that was the day someone first called me the "Mayor" of Castro Street. Or perhaps I invented it myself. A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.
M	YOUNG GAY MAN	The fucking cops, man, they're up on Castro Street! Toad Hall. Harvey and the guys race out of the store.
M	COP	Clear the sidewalk! Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of
M	HARVEY MILK	...if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests--
M	SCOTT SMITH	You're gonna run for Supervisor, is that the idea? I could go right for mayor, but I think I should work my way up to it... You'll be my campaign manager. Because I have so much experience in politics.
M	HARVEY MILK	Politics is theater. It doesn't matter if you win. You make a statement. You say, "I'm here, pay attention to me."
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey, you do that every time you cross the street.
M	HARVEY MILK	Coors looks like it might cave. The union boys will owe me. Imagine if we get their vote... It'll be fun!
M	SCOTT SMITH	Fun? Harvey starts kissing him all over.
M	HARVEY MILK	We'll make it a spectacle.
M	HARVEY MILK	A week ago, Police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals, and to jail. The charges, "Blocking a Sidewalk." Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	--Let us have our tax money go for our protection and not our persecution. Worry about gun control and not marijuana control.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	School supplies, seniors, not what books I read-- Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine. Harvey does a
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	My fellow degenerates, I would like to announce my candidacy for San Francisco City Supervisor! Scott unfurls three hand made "MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR"
M	HARVEY MILK	Public dental care for retired people... Legalize pot, vote Milk. Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Hey, I like the way your pants fit... Where are you from, kid? Sorry old man, not interested.
M	HARVEY MILK	Where's home?
M	CLEVE JONES	Phoenix.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for Supervisor. What's your name?
M	CLEVE JONES	Cleve... Jones.
M	HARVEY MILK	Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you.
M	CLEVE JONES	Fuck that. Elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation.
M	HARVEY MILK	Is that right? Do you trick up on Polk Street?
M	CLEVE JONES	If I need the cash... But I'm selective about my clients.
M	HARVEY MILK	Tell me one thing before you get back to work then. What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix?
M	CLEVE JONES	I faked a lung disease to get out of PE. So what? What are you, some kind of street shrink?
M	HARVEY MILK	Sometimes. But what I'm saying is, Phoenix can change. But we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
M	CLEVE JONES	Well, good luck with all that.
M	HARVEY MILK	You know what I think, Cleve Jones?
M	CLEVE JONES	That you're gonna get somewhere if you keep talking? No. That you need to do what you're good at. Be a prick. Fight City Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the people who made you come here to do what you do.
M	CLEVE JONES	Sorry old man, I'm leaving for Spain tomorrow. Europe. Got all the cash I need in my back pocket. A GROUP OF CLEVE'S FRIENDS shout at him to join them. Harvey
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	I didn't come out until very late in life. There was nobody to--
M	HARVEY MILK	--look up to, no hope for a better life. Those that did were outcast... arrested.. suicide. And the young ones, who did escape home... and who arrive in San Francisco, and then what...
M	COP	The âfruitâ was walking home with his âtrickâ when they were jumped. REVEAL: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the
M	COP (CONT'D)	Name's Robert Hillsborough. Did you know him?
M	HARVEY MILK	He used to come into my shop. Are there any witnesses?
M	COP	Just the "trick." Jerry Taylor.
M	HARVEY MILK	Jerry wasn't a trick. They were lovers.
M	COP	Call it what you will. He's our only witness and he says he can't identify the attackers.
M	HARVEY MILK	There'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe.
M	COP	You're the Mayor of Castro Street now, right Harvey? You really wanna help? Get your people to show some discretion on the streets, huh? HARVEY'S POV: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on the body
M	JIM RIVALDO	Well, it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in San Francisco are going to back Dianne Feinstein and other straight candidates they consider "gay-friendly."
M	SCOTT SMITH	Who cares about those old queens? Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH.
M	HARVEY MILK	Why isn't my campaign manager leading the meeting?
M	SCOTT SMITH	I'm beat, Harvey. I passed out flyers for seven hours straight.
M	HARVEY MILK	In the bathhouse?
M	SCOTT SMITH	People in bathhouses vote. I'm tired. I'm taking a nap. Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment.
M	HARVEY MILK	Just checking the exposure. That a new boyfriend? He's very cute.
M	CUSTOMER	Um... Thanks, Harvey.
M	HARVEY MILK	So who are these so-called "gay leaders?" And who appointed them? And what are you suggesting, Jim, that I'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement? PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening
M	HARVEY MILK	We're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they hell are they?
M	DICK PABICH	David Goodstein is the publisher of The Advocate and he has a house--
M	JIM RIVALDO	A mansion--
M	DICK PABICH	--in Atherton.
F	THELMA	Harvey, you should read this. CLOSE ON THE LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey.
M	SCOTT SMITH	"Harvey Milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell, a night of horror. You will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, prick cut off." I'm calling the police.
M	HARVEY MILK	They probably wrote it. Hey, If somebody tries to kill me, I'll get the sympathy vote, right? Could be just the push we need.
M	SCOTT SMITH	You think this is funny? Look at it. Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.
M	HARVEY MILK	It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No humor. It's insulting. CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of
M	SCOTT SMITH	Don't do that.
M	HARVEY MILK	If you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier. Now it's there. We'll see it every day. It can't get us.
M	SCOTT SMITH	All this energy... to make yourself a target. And what for? Something we have no chance to win. Harvey wraps his arms around him.
M	HARVEY MILK	I keep telling you, it's not just about winning.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	The "top gays" in San Francisco were David Goodstein and his lawyer sidekick Rick Stokes. David was a
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	rich old queen who'd bought the biggest gay magazine, The Advocate. He had it delivered to subscribers in brown paper bags so no-one would know... That's how he lived his life, covered up, discreet. Harvey and Scott are shown to the pool area by a HOUSE BOY. Scott strips off his clothes and DIVES INTO THE POOL. Rick can't keep his eyes off naked Scott in the pool.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	I worked for a financial institution. I was very discreet. But someone spotted me at the opera, sitting in a box, next to my lover. And I was fired. That's when I decided to do something. So I bought The Advocate. And I use my money and my influence in quiet ways, to do what I can...
M	HARVEY MILK	Endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us?
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	Yes, if they're friendly to our cause. Politics is complicated in San Francisco, and Supervisor is a citywide office. Political alliances need to be built. You can't simply move here from across the country and run for office.
M	HARVEY MILK	But I am running for office. I'm on the ballot. I have the union rank and file, the seniors, and I could use your magazine's endorsement.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	Harvey, we're like the Catholic church. We welcome converts, but we don't make them Pope the same day.
M	HARVEY MILK	And why haven't you run?
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	It's too early for a gay candidate for Supervisor. Especially one from the Castro. It's bad for the community's image. Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and
M	SCOTT SMITH	What's wrong with the Castro?
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	Nobody works there. It's all sex and drugs and more sex and no one taking responsibility for their own problems.
M	HARVEY MILK	The cops come into our neighborhood and beat us. They turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered.
M	RICK STOKES	Then we file a lawsuit against the in City Hall...
M	HARVEY MILK	There are no real gay allies. Yes, our friends may sense our struggle, but they can't feel it. It's not life or death for them. We need our own in office.
M	RICK STOKES	You can't demand acceptance overnight.
M	HARVEY MILK	Why not? How can we ask them to respect us if we don't show ourselves some self respect, David.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	The more âoutâ you make us, the more you incite them. Step back and quiet down.
M	HARVEY MILK	Go back into the closet? Is that what you're saying? Because I know the closet. I lived in it for more years than I care to remember. I don't need your endorsement. I'm not asking anyone for acceptance. I don't have time to ask.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	For you, politics is a game, a lark. Like putting on a rock festival or staging a "love-in." You're too old to be a hippie, Harvey Milk! Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a movement. The movement is the candidate. There's a difference. You don't see the difference. But I do.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Thanks for the swim. I'm sorry I pissed in your pool.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	When the vote came in on election day... out of 32 candidates vying for 6 seats... We came in 10th. Just a handful short of being the first big eared, gay as a three- dollar-bill, cock sucker ever elected to public office.
M	HARVEY MILK	So... I went for it again in '75... with just a few... minor... adjustments.
M	SCOTT SMITH	No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous and I hate your hair. You're not fooling anybody.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm not gonna let the Pacific Heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail. I like it. Scott is horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this from one of my kind?
F	LILY	No, no. You won't run into the owner. He died in that suit.
M	SCOTT SMITH	This isn't sexy, Harvey. Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him. Then playful:
M	HARVEY MILK	Too bad. No more pot, no more bath houses for me and little poo.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	We ran and we lost the Supervisors race a second time in '75, but with
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	more votes than ever. So in 1976, against everyone's advice, I really pissed off the Democratic political power houses, because I ran against "their boy"--
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	--Art Agnos, a part of their "Political Machine." And this time we weren't running for City Supervisor. This time it was bigger, California State Assembly.
M	HARVEY MILK	It's a racket. It's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force. It's Racist. Homophobic.
M	ART AGNOS	How many people do you consider enemies, Harvey? I've counted five already. Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience.
M	HARVEY MILK	You're right, Art. And many are your closest friends. You see, I don't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine. Machines operate on oil and grease. They're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator.
M	ART AGNOS	Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as a social worker in this city. I know Sacramento. I know how to get done what we all need done there.
M	HARVEY MILK	Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner. Stabbed,
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	fifteen times. The last words he heard were "Faggot, Faggot, Faggot..." And you say you're outraged, but why won't your liberal establishment return our calls? Why won't they bring these murderers to justice?
M	ART AGNOS	You know Harv', your whole rap's a real downer.
M	HARVEY MILK	My God, you're handsome up close. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to licking you... in the polls. You talk a lot about what you're against. What are you for? In this town, you gotta give em' a reason for optimism or you're cooked. Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey. Dinner.
M	HARVEY	... get some union boys in the audience, they love me...
M	JIM RIVALDO	I can't control who's in the audience...
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey, you need to eat something. Now. Scott steps back into the kitchen.
M	SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)	Ladies and Gentlemen. Our apartment is officially off limits. CHASES the VOLUNTEERS out of the kitchen, out of his
M	SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)	Downstairs. Time to go. Go. OUT! Harvey emerges, about to intervene.
M	SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)	Don't say anything. For once, Harvey keeps his mouth shut. Jim and Dick sneak
M	SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)	Sit down and eat. Harvey and Scott eat dinner in tense silence.
M	SCOTT	If you say one thing about politics or your campaign or where you're speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need... I'll stab you with my fork I swear to God.
M	HARVEY	I just wanted to say... This is the most delicious meal I've ever eaten in my entire life. Harvey gives a warm smile. Scott gives a laugh, but he looks
M	HARVEY MILK	If we lose this one, it'll be just me and you again. I promise. Scott nods. That's exactly what he needed to hear. A CAR PULLS UP BEHIND HARVEY. A MAN jumps out of the car, and He gets to the doorway of his camera store, and runs face
M	HARVEY MILK	Phoenix? We should go inside. They do. Harvey locks the door behind them.
M	CLEVE JONES	You staying up with me?
M	HARVEY MILK	The election's tomorrow. I won't sleep... Was he good looking?
M	CLEVE JONES	No. He was hideous.
M	HARVEY MILK	Hard to tell what's worse. With me, my boyfriends usually find better looking ones to cheat with.
M	CLEVE JONES	I thought we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
M	HARVEY MILK	Guess what, Cleve Jones.
M	CLEVE JONES	What?
M	HARVEY MILK	You're going to meet the most extraordinary men, the sexiest, brightest, funniest men, and you're going to fall in love with so many of them, and you won't know until the end of your life who your greatest friends were or your greatest love was.
M	CLEVE JONES	Is that supposed to help?
M	HARVEY MILK	Maybe a little. Or not.
M	CLEVE JONES	I went to Spain last month... long story. In Barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died under Franco. The police tried to break it up. It started a riot. A bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept fighting. There was blood literally running in the gutter.
M	HARVEY MILK	We could have a revolution here too. But you can't just use the Castro to cruise. You gotta fight.
M	CLEVE JONES	You think you'll win?
M	HARVEY MILK	Winning isn't my strong suit. Well, I don't "do" losing. Ever. Maybe I should run for office, and you can work for me. If you can do it, I can do it.
M	HARVEY MILK	Can you assemble a thousand people in an hour?
M	CLEVE JONES	Yeah, sure.
M	HARVEY MILK	All right, if I run again, you're my man.
M	CLEVE JONES	If...?
M	HARVEY MILK	Polls open in 3 hours. Lets hit the bus stops.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	And we lost that Assembly Race too, which made me a bona fide three- time, political loser.
M	ANITA BRYANT (SINGING ON TV)	"Come to the Florida sunshine tree, great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin c, from the Florida sunshine tree." Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps
M	JIM RIVALDO	We lost, but we lost by less! More votes than ever... I remember when that used to work. I want to show you something. This is remarkable. Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with
M	JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)	The red is where you did best tonight. If we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can -- we can -- our new Supervisor's District will go right up Market. Right around the Castro. The district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED.
M	JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)	If you run for Supervisor with this new district, it's a potential landslide. You'll be the first up- front gay man elected to major office in the U.S.
M	HARVEY MILK	I don't know if I have another one in me. Or Scott. But Harvey's gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY - A CHYRON READS: "Landslide defeat for Florida Gay Rights
M	ANITA BRYANT (ON TV)	Tonight the laws of God and the cultural values of man have been vindicated. The people of Dade county, the normal majority, have said enough, enough, enough.
M	TV REPORTER	Gays in Florida can now be removed from their jobs and prosecuted if their "deviant" lifestyles are uncovered. HARVEY'S POV OUT A WINDOW: FURIOUS GAYS pour out of the bars
M	ANITA BRYANT (ON TV)	Gays can't reproduce, so they must recruit young people into their lifestyle...
M	TV REPORTER	Bryant, a spokeswoman for the orange juice industry, vowed to
M	TV REPORTER (CONT'D)	bring her campaign to the rest of the country... Harvey's PHONE RINGS. He snatches it up.
M	HARVEY MILK	Scottie?
M	BOY'S VOICE	I'm sorry sir. I um... I read about you in the paper.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm sorry. I can't talk right--
M	BOY'S VOICE	Sir, I think I want to kill myself.
M	HARVEY MILK	No. You don't want to do that. Where do you live?
M	BOY'S VOICE	In Minnesota.
M	HARVEY MILK	You saw me in a paper in Minnesota? How'd I look?
M	BOY'S VOICE	My folks are taking me to this place tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me.
M	HARVEY MILK	There's nothing wrong with you. Listen to me. You don't have to hurt yourself, okay? Are you there? Here's what you have to do. Are you listening?
M	BOY'S VOICE	Yes.
M	HARVEY MILK	Get on a bus. Go to the next biggest city. New York, San Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis. It doesn't matter. Just leave. You won't be alone. There are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	You're not sick. You're not wrong. God does not hate you. Just leave.
M	BOY'S VOICE	I can't.
M	HARVEY MILK	Yes. You can. Just get on a bus.
M	BOY'S VOICE	I can't... I can't walk, sir. I'm in a wheelchair... Sir. Are you there? Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM...
M	HARVEY MILK	That's okay. It's going to be okay. Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE,
M	DICK PABICH	Harvey, you better come down. There's gonna be a riot. Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out A
M	CLEVE JONES	Out of the bar and into the streets! Anita Bryant is coming after you!
M	POLICEMAN	If you can't control em', we will.
M	HARVEY MILK	Give me permission to march them.
M	POLICEMAN	Where?
M	HARVEY MILK	Anywhere.
M	HARVEY MILK	I know you are angry. I am angry. Follow me through the streets of San Francisco to share our anger! Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Are they following in back?
M	CLEVE JONES	Yes. Where are we going?
M	HARVEY MILK	I don't know. We have to keep them moving. Exhaust them. March them till they drop. We can't have a riot tonight. Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their nightsticks
M	DICK PABICH	They're still too hot in back. They'll burn the joint down.
M	HARVEY MILK	Help me turn them up Van Ness. We'll go all the way to Broadway. Dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd. Harvey
M	HARVEY MILK	My name is Harvey Milk... And I want to recruit you. The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	I am here tonight to say, we will no longer sit quietly in our closets. We must fight. Not just in the Castro, or San Francisco, but everywhere the Anitas go. Anita Bryant did not win tonight. Anita Bryant has brought us together... She is going to create a national gay force! And the young people in Richmond, Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi, or Woodmere, New York... Who are coming out and hearing Anita Bryant on television telling them that they're wrong, they're sick, that there is no place for them in this great country, in this world... They're looking to us for something tonight... And I say, we have to give them hope!
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	--Hope for a better world... Hope for a better tomorrow... Hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great...
M	HARVEY MILK	Hope for the worker who awakens from the American dream to find that all the jobs have left the country... We gotta give em' HOPE! PAN FACES OF TEAMSTERS - Several MINORITY FACES. CLOSE ON
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	When San Francisco changed the voting rules--
M	HARVEY MILK	--they allowed people to elect Supervisors directly from their own neighborhoods. A black neighborhood could elect an African- American. Chinatown could elect a Chinese Supervisor... And the Castro could choose me or Rick Stokes. But decent art begs for balance, right? So little district 8, two miles south of The Castro--
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	--promised to stay the same as ever. Conservative, Irish, Catholic and with just the right touch of poetry, they found themselves a handsome ex-cop.
M	DAN WHITE	I'm not going to be forced out of San Francisco by splinter groups of social radicals, social deviants, and incorrigibles. You must realize there are thousands upon thousands of frustrated, angry people such as yourselves waiting to unleash a fury that will eradicate the malignancies which blight our beautiful city.
M	HARVEY MILK	Evelyn Lear's in town, at the Opera house in Tannhauser.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Clearly.
M	HARVEY MILK	What if she strolls into the Castro for a cocktail? Just one more. We can't let Rick Stokes take it.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Let Rick have it. Nobody thinks you're a fraud here, Harvey. You're not in New York, you're not a closet case asshole anymore. People respect you here. Relax for a year. Get us back on our feet.
M	HARVEY MILK	If people are ever going to take me seriously, I have to win this one.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Since when did you care if anyone took you seriously?
M	HARVEY MILK	Anita wants to put us all back in concentration camps. Rick Stokes is too weak to beat her back if she gets to California. I have to be in office to protect us from them.
M	SCOTT SMITH	I can't do another one. I'll be back for my sheets. If you're not here, I'll see you in the shop next week. Scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the
M	HARVEY MILK	If you leave me right now... I can find someone new.
M	SCOTT SMITH	I know. You're a catch. Scott leaves. Harvey is in shock, unable to comprehend the
M	HARVEY MILK	--Ring out the old, ring in the new. This is over. Done. I don't want to see anything that say's fucking Assembly. This three-time loser faggot is running for Supervisor goddamn it! ANNE KRONENBERG, 23, parks her motorcycle outside, WALKS INTO
M	JIM RIVALDO	Who the heck is she?
M	HARVEY MILK	Our new campaign manager. She called last week to volunteer and I asked her to help.
M	DICK PABICH	Help or take over? What about Scott?
M	HARVEY MILK	We need new blood. Guys... Anne Kronenberg. She's a woman... A woman who likes women. Odd, isn't it?
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Hi guys. Mr. Milk... Rick Stokes isn't pulling out. He's officially filed to run against you. My friend at The Advocate says David Goodstein is backing him.
M	MICHAEL WONG	A gay candidate against a gay candidate. It's unfortunate.
M	JIM RIVALDO	They'll split the gay vote. The straights will divide and conquer.
M	HARVEY MILK	Try to find out when they're going to announce.
M	DICK PABICH	You replaced Scott with a lesbian?
M	HARVEY MILK	Anne worked on a recycling campaign up North. She's very organized.
M	JIM RIVALDO	How do you know she's not a plant from Rick Stokes' campaign?
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Are you guys always this paranoid?
M	MICHAEL WONG	Yes. They take after Harvey.
M	HARVEY MILK	Shouldn't you be doing someone's laundry?
M	MICHAEL WONG	Right after you redecorate my house.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Sir, my girlfriends say you guys don't like women. Just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or are you scared of girls?
M	HARVEY MILK	Gentleman, we already have a tinker bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick in your three-piece suits. We need someone to manage things. A woman this time. She's the right price, and she has bigger balls than any of you.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Just give me whatever's left over in the register at the end of the day. So should I call the Chronicle about getting US an endorsement? No? OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition. Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the
M	RICK STOKES	Young lady, you must be confused. This is my night, not Mr. Milk's.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign manager. Anne Kronenberg.
M	RICK STOKES	Then you should know this race is for District 5, the Castro, not for all of your lesbian... compadres-- A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	I'm sorry. Are we distracting you, Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you up on your big night. Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more
M	DICK PABICH	Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do you have any more hand cards?
M	RICK STOKES	These people are not from this area. They need to leave. Now.
M	DICK PABICH	Not true. Guess where we found them all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up on Valencia Street. Living right there in our district. And you see, as it turns out, Annie here is very, very popular with the ladies. Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is stupefied. Harvey reads the FLIER: âUnite and Fight for Dan White.â
M	HARVEY MILK	They've accused me of many things, but never as blatant a lie as this.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	First ever newspaper endorsement.
M	CLEVE JONES	They endorsed you for being a good businessman? Has Scott read this? He'll piss himself.
M	HARVEY MILK	Yeah? Go show him.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Cleve, maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with. Just in case.
M	CLEVE JONES	I'm going to The Stud. Meet me out. Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone
M	GAY MAN	Gonna win this time, Milk? They walk on, not waiting for an answer. Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops. He stares
M	JACK LIRA	You're more handsome in the posters.
M	HARVEY MILK	Thank you. Where do you live?
M	JACK LIRA	...Palomino's are my favorite horse. They're smart. They're fast and compact. Do you think I'm more like a Palomino or a Stallion? Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls down into
M	JACK LIRA	My father beat me when he found out... So I came here. I stay in this man's house. But I don't like him.
M	HARVEY	Shh, it's okay, now. No one's ever going to beat you again. A long, comforting beat between them.
M	JACK LIRA	I love you.
M	HARVEY	Do you even remember my name? Harvey.
M	JACK LIRA	I love you, Harvey.
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	And for the first time in my life, it all came together... the union boys, the women, the seniors, the minorities... All of the us's showed up...
M	RICK STOKES	We just want to congratulate him.
M	CLEVE JONES	I'm sorry. We're all full.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	Harvey! Harvey!
M	HARVEY MILK	It's too crowded. Sorry! JACK LIRA shoves his way toward the door...
M	JACK LIRA	Harvey! Harvey PULLS JACK INSIDE, right past Goodstein and Stokes.
M	HARVEY MILK	Scottie--? But Scott fades into the CROWD. Harvey (with Jack at his
M	CLEVE JONES	The new Mrs. Milk. I give it a week.
M	JACK LIRA	Harvey, is this all for you? Are you this famous?
M	HARVEY MILK	No, darling. We do this all the time. Do you like it? Jim is calling out NAMES of the OTHER WINNERS.
M	JIM RIVALDO	Carol Ruth Silver... Gordon Lau... It's the most liberal Board in years!
M	HARVEY MILK	What about Dan White? Did he win? We'll deal with him tomorrow. Harvey is DOUSED with champagne. JUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER. Jack
M	CHANNEL 5 REPORTER	Does this mean, as many straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over San Francisco? Are you going to be a Supervisor for all the people?
M	HARVEY MILK	I have to be. That's what I was elected for. I have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city effect all of us. Thank you San Francisco! Thank you!
M	HARVEY MILK	I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter and during such time as I hold the office of Supervisor, City and County of San Francisco. Bulbs FLASH. A light rain begins to fall. Umbrellas go up.
M	HARVEY MILK(CONT'D)	Anita Bryant said gay people brought the drought to California. Looks to me like it's finally started raining! Cheers. Harvey is emboldened.
M	HOST (ON TV)	This will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many new faces on the Board of Supervisors. Do you think such diversity will cripple the Board?
M	HARVEY MILK (ON TV)	The name of the game on the Board is six votes to get anything passed. So, like it or not, Dan and I are now in bed together... politically speaking. THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up
M	DAN WHITE (ON TV)	I've assured Harvey here that my brochure's comments about "social deviants" referred more to junkies than to his people. See, I'm about to have my first child. I have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him.
M	HARVEY MILK	How long were you a fireman, Dan?
M	DAN WHITE	A couple of years.
M	HARVEY MILK	And before that... You were a police officer? Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point?
M	DAN WHITE	You have something against cops?
M	HARVEY MILK	No. They tend to have something against me. But firefighters. Now those are true heroes... They supported me in the last campaign. I support them fully.
M	DAN WHITE	I appreciate it.
M	HARVEY MILK	I meant what I said. I'd like to work together. Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake. It's a step.
M	DAN WHITE	I'll see you at the office, Mr. Milk.
M	HARVEY MILK	What do you think of my new theater?
M	CLEVE JONES	A bit over the top.
M	HARVEY MILK	What's with the suit?
M	CLEVE JONES	I got it from a friend. Harvey leads Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.
M	HARVEY MILK	When you come here, I want you to wear the tightest jeans possible. Never blend in. And no elevators. Ever. Always take the stairs, you can make such a grand entrance going up the stairs.
M	HARVEY MILK	And street talk only around Feinstein. Shit, goddamn, fuck,
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	all that. It bugs the hell out of her. They arrive at his Lead Aide's desk: it's Anne Kronenberg.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up on mail.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Will do.
M	HARVEY MILK	Come into my office...
M	HARVEY MILK	The first order of business that will come out of this office is a city wide Gay Rights Ordinance. Just like the one Anita shot down in Dade County. What do you think, Lotus Blossom?
M	MICHAEL WONG	I think it's good. Not great.
M	HARVEY MILK	Then make it brilliant. I want Anita's attention here. In San Francisco. I want her to bring her fight to US... This Bill needs a unanimous vote. We need headlines.
M	JIM RIVALDO	Dan White won't vote for this. Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
M	HARVEY MILK	Dan's fine. He's just uneducated. We can teach him. Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.
M	DAN WHITE	Harvey, committee meets at 9:30. Oh, hi Michael, Jim. Hey, did you get the invitation to
M	DAN WHITE (CONT'D)	my son's christening? I invited a few of the other supes as well.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'll be there.
M	DAN WHITE	Great! All smiles, Dan leaves. Cleve mocks him. OFF Mike Wong's
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Are you going?
M	HARVEY MILK	Hey. I'll let him christen me, if he'll vote for my Gay Rights Ordinance. We need allies. We need everyone. Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.
M	HARVEY	Jack?
M	JACK LIRA	Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're hungry. I only know how to cook one thing, but I make it good.
M	HARVEY	Did you... break in?
M	JACK LIRA	I asked the boy downstairs to let me in...
M	HARVEY	Danny?
M	JACK LIRA	He wouldn't let me in. So I came in this way. Your friends aren't very nice to me.
M	HARVEY	I have a Town Hall meeting tonight, Jack.
M	JACK LIRA	You work too hard. I'm sorry about your window. I'll fix it tomorrow. Are you surprised?!
M	HARVEY MILK	Jack, I have to go. I have an invitation to a party tomorrow. Lots of rich people, politicians. We could get all dressed up... Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
M	JACK LIRA	So I could be the first lady?
M	HARVEY MILK	Uh-huh.
M	JACK LIRA	I watched TV here today. All day. I saw All My Children. They killed Margo. I knew it was going to happen. They try and trick you but it never works.
M	HARVEY MILK	You always see it coming?
M	JACK LIRA	What? Killing the blonde? Every time. I'm good with that. I think now the old lady is going to have an affair. Then she'll get killed or married. Always one or the other. Dead or married. Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.
M	HARVEY MILK	If I make you a key, you won't break my windows again, right?
M	JACK LIRA	That's right. The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm proposing a citywide ordinance. It ensures that a person who already has a job can't be fired for their orientation.
M	DAN WHITE	I'm not sure my constituents would favor that. Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.
M	HARVEY MILK	Is anyone else here from the Board?
M	DAN WHITE	You're the only one who showed up I think.
M	HARVEY MILK	Were you christened here?
M	DAN WHITE	Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My grandma immigrated here when this was an Irish Catholic city. The City of St. Francis... A lot's changed here since then.
M	HARVEY MILK	You're more like one of us now... an outsider.
M	DAN WHITE	You're not like most homosexuals, are you, Harvey?
M	HARVEY MILK	Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"
M	DAN WHITE	Say, where do you stand on the Psychiatric Center the City's been pushing into my district?
M	HARVEY MILK	Well, I'd have to study it... Getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform. It only attracts arsonist, rapists, all that, you know.
M	HARVEY MILK	Sure, sure. A campaign promise.
M	DAN WHITE	A big one. What do you say we watch out for each other's interests? I'd like that.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'd like that, too, Dan. Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as
M	DAN WHITE	I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop talk.
M	HARVEY MILK	The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.
M	MARY ANN WHITE	Seems an inappropriate subject in here don't you think?
M	HARVEY MILK	Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it. His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She
M	DICK PABICH	Supervisors Silver and Lau are asking you to vote to keep this Psychiatric Center in Dan's district. It'll go down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it.
M	MICHAEL WONG	It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These are kids that would be displaced from their families if it's moved.
M	HARVEY MILK	I can't just dump Dan. The guy's got nothing going for him. No friends...
M	CLEVE JONES	Here we go, Harvey to the rescue. Isn't it enough we have to put up with Jack?
M	HARVEY MILK	Lay off. He registered 120 voters last week.
M	CLEVE JONES	So do any of your volunteers, but you don't make them all first lady.
M	MICHAEL WONG	What does Dan White do for you? Really? Politically?
M	HARVEY MILK	He intrigues me... I think he may be one of us. Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up:
M	CLEVE JONES	Dear God, say it ain't so!
M	HARVEY MILK	It's just a theory...
M	DICK PABICH	You just think he's cute.
M	HARVEY MILK	No... I know what it's like to live that life. That lie. You can see it in Dan's eyes... The fear, the pressure... Anne Kronenberg walks in. She's got that look in her eyes.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Good or Bad?
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Not great. State Senator John Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy in California for sure. He's filed his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them. A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.
M	HARVEY MILK	How many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot?
M	CLEVE JONES	Whatever. He can get them in two Sundays at church in Orange County.
M	HARVEY MILK	This means the fight's coming here, where we can do something about it! Wichita's one thing, Kansas City. But Anita's heading for San Francisco! She's not going to know what hit her. Smile, children! This is the fight we've been waiting for.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	My proposition promises to protect our children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children to their deviant lifestyles, including the ones who do it in our public schools. It's time to root them out. In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up:
M	TOM AMMIANO	And how are you going to determine who's a homosexual?
M	JOHN BRIGGS	Sir, my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals.
M	ANOTHER PROTESTER	How? Will you be sucking them off?
M	JOHN BRIGGS	Sir, you can argue with me, but you cannot argue with God. It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO
M	HARVEY MILK (ON TV)	Look what happened in Germany. Now Anita Bryant already says that Jews and Muslims are going to hell, you know she's got a shopping list. We are not going to let John Briggs or Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in this city... Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	Hello, Harvey. Running late? Oh Harvey... your boyfriend is in the closet.
M	HARVEY MILK	Excuse me, David? The Latino, he's locked himself in the coat room... Mr. Milk, Phil Burton is here. He's likely the next Speaker of the House and a much needed ally against Prop Six. We don't need a scene.
M	HARVEY MILK	You're right, I know, I was late by twenty minutes. I'm sorry, Jack.
M	JACK LIRA (O.S.)	Who were you with? Scott? Some boy?
M	HARVEY MILK	I was at work. Come out, sugar pea. No. You embarrassed me. I didn't know anyone. These are not good people. I don't want to be here.
M	HARVEY MILK	Then go home, Jack.
M	JACK LIRA (O.S.)	No. I'll wait for you. Go away. A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	The Briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide.
M	CLEVE JONES	80 percent in other polls. Some even have us losing San Francisco.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	So it's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this, or we'll have riots and only increase this backlash.
M	HARVEY JONES	Good point, David. Let's just roll right over. Make it easier for Briggs to fuck us up the ass. Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it,
M	PHIL BURTON	We're taking this very seriously in my office. We want to send one of these to every home in California. We'll need money to do that.
M	HARVEY MILK	"Proposition Six is an affront to Human Rights. An invasion of the State into the private lives of California citizens." Does it even say the word gay on this thing? Anywhere?
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	No Harvey, purposefully not.
M	PHIL BURTON	With the heat bearing down on your movement right now, we think it's best to dodge the "gay" bullet. Go for the human rights angle.
M	HARVEY MILK	People need to know who's affected. This flier needs at least one old queen on it. Why don't you volunteer for that, David?
M	RICK STOKES	Corey Wares is an out gay--
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	
M	HARVEY MILK	This is shit. Shit and masturbation. It's a coward's response to a dangerous threat.
M	DAVID GOODSTEIN	I think you should leave. In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree.
M	HARVEY MILK	Jack, it's time to go. Get everyone together. I want young people, women, fresh heads. Fighters and organizers, not politicians.
M	CLEVE JONES	What about, S-C-O-T-T? OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of
M	CLEVE JONES	We're not interested in working with those old Democratic Party shits. THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters. He's HOLDING THE HAND Scott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor. Harvey's
M	JIM RIVALDO	But we can't afford infighting anymore, Cleve. We have to bring together every group. Even the old school Democrats.
M	HARVEY MILK	Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or are we just gonna stare? People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	If we're gonna convince the 90% to give a shit about us 10%... We have to let 'em know who we are. Everybody's coming out. The entire state. No matter where they live.
M	DICK PABICH	"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm serious. We're going to tell everyone in the state to come out. Every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... We have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there know that they do know one of us. And if people won't step out of the closet, we open the door for them.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Jesus.
M	SCOTT SMITH	The whole state is not San Francisco.
M	HARVEY MILK	Clearly, Scott.
M	JIM RIVALDO	It could be dangerous. There is such a thing as a right to privacy.
M	HARVEY MILK	Privacy's our enemy. You want real political power? Let's tell the truth for a change. Starting here. If there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers... Do it. Now.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	My folks know already. A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill.
M	DICK PABICH	I haven't told my father yet...
M	HARVEY MILK	People vote two to one for us if they know just one of us. Cleve, show Dick where you keep your phone.
M	CLEVE JONES	It's in the bedroom. After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room.
M	HARVEY MILK	I thought you were done with politics.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Politics. Not the movement. What the hell was that in there?
M	HARVEY MILK	The movement needs people to be up- front. Why were you fighting me?
M	SCOTT SMITH	You were the biggest closet case alive in New York. You told me and all your boyfriends to keep our traps shut. You were the hypocrite in there.
M	HARVEY MILK	My parents are gone. My brother knows. I'm sure they knew.
M	SCOTT SMITH	I had to listen to your phone calls home to Mom. Hear you deny that I existed. You want to be "normal" as bad as any of us. More than any of us... Those are kids in there. You're asking them to lose their families.
M	HARVEY MILK	If their families won't love them for who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them.
M	SCOTT SMITH	That's fucking insane.
M	HARVEY MILK	Who's he? Do you live together?
M	SCOTT SMITH	Someone I'm seeing. He's good for me. He makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars...
M	HARVEY MILK	I miss you.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Oh, Harvey, don't... What's that about?
M	JACK LIRA	Har-veyyyyy! He needs me. Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL.
M	HARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN	I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will today or to Supervisor White come to order. in the past--
M	HARVEY MILK	--I want it noted that I never promised to back moving any Mental Health Centers. I greatly respect Supervisor White, but I would like his remarks stricken.
M	DIANNE FEINSTEIN	Duly noted. We will take a recess before recording the vote. Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey.
M	CAROL RUTH SILVER	Thank you, Harvey. Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back.
M	DAN WHITE	Can I have a moment with Harvey? Alone, please, Carol? She politely recognizes the tension and gets up.
M	DAN WHITE (CONT'D)	Why are you turning on me like this at the last minute? What did I do?
M	HARVEY MILK	I didn't have all the details. I'll help you craft a different version that doesn't displace any kids.
M	DAN WHITE	Harvey, I can't go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this. Don't do this.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm getting a lot of pressure, Dan.
M	DAN WHITE	You strung me along. And now you're throwing me to the wolves.
M	HARVEY MILK	You only need one more vote, Dan. There are 5 other Supervisors you could convince besides me. Dan grabs Harvey. It's threatening. A new side of Dan.
M	DAN WHITE	I'll vote against your Queer Law. I'll get Quentin against it.
M	HARVEY MILK	It'll still pass. You can't keep alienating yourself here, Dan.
M	DAN WHITE	I gave you a chance, Harvey. I really did. You blew it. You really blew it. Dan goes, the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit.
M	HARVEY MILK	Across the country, a handful of city councils had passed the very first ordinances protecting gay people against discrimination. But Anita Bryant and her right wing Christian fundamentalists were creating and exploiting and fanning a backlash. Now she had referenda to repeal all of these gay rights ordinances. While we were preparing for the battle against Briggs and Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking her show on the road... sweeping the country. Her next stop was Wichita, Kansas.
M	ANITA BRYANT	I give thanks for all of our foot soldiers of God here in Wichita. But we must push on. Look what happened to Sodom and to the world of Noah. Onward Christian soldiers!
M	ANITA BRYANT (CONT'D)	On to California!
M	CLEVE JONES	Hi. We're losing Wichita. Rally tonight. Sundown. Market and Castro. A MULTIPLYING FRAME EFFECT: the person he called calls two
M	CLEVE JONES	They're moving. I don't know where, but...
M	HARVEY MILK	Did Jim call the press? Get out there with your camera!
M	DANNY NICCOLETTA	I'm going!
M	CLEVE JONES	Press is covered. But we don't have a permit to march.
M	HARVEY MILK	When I got Coors out of the bars, the Union gave me this. I want you to have it.
M	CLEVE JONES	What do I do with this?
M	HARVEY MILK	You're an activist. Take it. March them. March those people up to the front doors of City Hall. When it looks Supervisor will come out and play peacemaker. We save the city from a riot. We can turn this night into more political power for the cause.
M	CLEVE JONES	I can't do it like you do it.
M	HARVEY MILK	I won't always be here. Somebody else will have to take over. I need you to be the scary one now. CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging him.
M	CLEVE JONES	Forty years ago tonight, the gay citizens of Germany found out they no longer had civil rights. Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens of Wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights. You have whistles. You use them when we have been attacked. Tonight we have been attacked. Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns,
M	CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)	Fuck. Shit. Harvey! Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get
M	CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)	Get the press to the overpass! ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD Cleve gets to the head of the crowd.
M	CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)	Move... Left... Move... Left...
M	JIM RIVALDO	What are you doing? Where's Harvey?
M	CLEVE JONES	We're shutting down traffic, both directions. Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass
M	CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)	Disconnect the power arms! The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms.
M	HARVEY MILK	Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you. I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our democracy against the Anita Bryants and John Briggs who are trying to legalize bigotry! We have a choice to make. The fight is at our doors. We must either go back in the closet and shut it tight, or fight... History shows that if we continue to fight, we... will... win.
M	CLEVE JONES	They're calling it a "successful mediation." You're a God damn hero. Fuck. It came this close to a riot.
M	HARVEY	Lose the note cards next time. Your job is just to say into that bullhorn what they're all feeling.
M	CLEVE JONES	You're just jealous it wasn't you out there.
M	HARVEY MILK	We're losing Prop Six by 60% and you're over there celebrating a riot. I need more visibility... If we're going to beat this thing, we have to get Briggs to acknowledge us. Harvey steps away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Every paper's calling Prop Six the main event now. We lose this, we'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states, and Briggs won't return our calls for a public debate.
M	DICK PABICH	He's ignoring us to death.
M	HARVEY MILK	We need something populist. What's the number one complaint about city life?
M	CLEVE JONES	The piss smell in the Tenderloin.
M	HARVEY MILK	Close.
M	FRANK ROBINSON	Dog shit.
M	JIM RIVALDO	If you cleaned up all the dog shit in the city, you could be elected Mayor.
M	CLEVE JONES	"Mayor Milk."
M	HARVEY MILK	I like it.
M	HARVEY MILK	Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of that, it's disgusting. Under the ordinance, dog owners that don't clean up can be fined. This really is the bottom line! He smiles at his own joke, punctuating it by "accidentally"
M	CLERK	Supervisor Lau?
M	GORDON LAU	Aye.
M	CLERK	Lau, Aye. Supervisor Silver?
M	CAROL RUTH SILVER	Aye.
M	CLERK	Silver, Aye. Supervisor White?
M	DAN WHITE	No.
M	CLERK	White, No. Madam President, I have ten ayes and one no. Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard.
M	DIANNE FEINSTEIN	The San Francisco Gay Rights Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors Milk and Silver is passed.
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	I can't get my stories on page ten, you're getting page one?
M	HARVEY MILK	Doggy-doo's a real problem, George. With a shit eating grin, Harvey offers up a powder blue pen.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	Powder blue to sign they city's first Gay Rights law... George, we need your help with Briggs... The gay community will have your back from now on. On all issues. I hope you'll have ours. A beat between them. An alliance is forming. The Mayor sits
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	Good morning, everyone... I don't do this enough, taking swift and unambiguous action on a substantive move for civil rights. Moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen. Harvey leans Harvey comes to the door.
M	HARVEY MILK	What are you working on, Dan?
M	DAN WHITE	If you have something to discuss, you can have your aide make an appointment with my aide.
M	HARVEY MILK	Listen, I know you're disappointed about the Psychiatric Center... What else do you have coming up?
M	DAN WHITE	Now you need something from me. You want my me to join in with the Queers on this Prop Six business?
M	HARVEY MILK	We prefer the word "gay," Dan. Just as I'm sure you prefer the word, "Irish-American" to "Mick."
M	DAN WHITE	Harvey, our society can't exist without the family, without the church.
M	HARVEY MILK	We're not against those things.
M	DAN WHITE	You're not? Can two men reproduce?
M	HARVEY MILK	No. But, we keep trying!
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	C'mon, Dan. You're channeling Anita and Briggs... we can work together. On something...
M	DAN WHITE	Okay. You introduce an initiative for Supervisor pay raises.
M	HARVEY MILK	It's a bad time politically. I have an election next year.
M	DAN WHITE	You asked for something. Introduce pay raises. I can't take care of my family on our salaries. You don't have that problem, do you? Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems surprised to see
M	DAN WHITE (CONT'D)	Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have a development meeting. Dan goes.
M	HARVEY MILK	What's wrong, Taco Bell?
M	JACK LIRA	Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of your table. You should fire them.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'll take it under consideration. Why don't you get us a drink? A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott approaches.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you calling him Taco Bell.
M	HARVEY MILK	He's getting better. He's enrolling in classes on Monday. Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket.
M	SCOTT SMITH	I remember when your birthdays were a bit less... lavish. More intimate.
M	HARVEY MILK	Who invited you? Anne?
M	SCOTT SMITH	My boyfriend got an invitation. I was his "plus one."
M	HARVEY MILK	Congratulations. It was a tough ticket to get.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Congratulations to you. Looks like you're part of the Machine now. You can do better.
M	HARVEY MILK	When I come home to Jack, I don't have to talk politics or talk intelligently. Or even talk. And where's an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man, right?
M	SCOTT SMITH	You're not so old. You look handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like you're gonna make it to fifty after- all, Mr. Milk. Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS. Emerging from the shadows: DAN WHITE. He approaches Harvey Dan is SUPER-FRIENDLY, as if nothing unpleasant has ever
M	DAN WHITE	Sorry I missed the party, Harv...
M	HARVEY MILK	No problem, Dan. Good to see you.
M	DAN WHITE	Dog poop?
M	HARVEY MILK	Yeah.
M	DAN WHITE	It's good! It's a good one.
M	HARVEY MILK	Thanks. But it's a real problem.
M	DAN WHITE	Oh, yeah. I mean, God knows how many problems it causes. All kinds of diseases, birth defects probably, I mean, stuff you can't even... Hey, I got you a little something.
M	HARVEY MILK	You didn't have to--
M	DAN WHITE	You didn't have to-- Why do people always say that? "You didn't have to?" I mean, of course, right? But, that's what they always say. They always say things like that... Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.
M	HARVEY MILK	Are you okay, Dan?
M	DAN WHITE	Oh, what? Yeah, sure. Harvey, I just... I just want to say... Happy Birthday. Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but
M	DAN WHITE (CONT'D)	I've really learned a lot from watching you, Harvey.
M	HARVEY MILK	I doubt that.
M	DAN WHITE	No, I have. You gotta get out there. Get noticed. That's how it works. But, you have an issue. That's your advantage.
M	HARVEY MILK	It's more than an issue, Dan. Dan. I've had four relationships in my life. Three of those four tried to kill themselves. I know it was my fault they did it. I told them to stay quiet. To hide. Most of my life I've been closeted. That's what living this life is like for most of us. The way things are... This isn't just about our jobs, or any issue, it's our lives we're fighting for. Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on
M	DAN WHITE	I've learned a lot from you, Harvey. I'm going to get my picture in the papers, too. You'll see. I've got my own issue. That's right. Dan White's Got An Issue! A MONTAGE: of the various marchers, floats, "Parents and Harvey sits on top of a car with a pink lei around his neck,
M	HARVEY MILK	Come out! Just come on out! DRIVING THE CAR: Anne keeps a close eye on the parade
M	DAN WHITE	I see naked men walking around, naked women walking around, which doesn't bother me as far as my personal standards of nudity, but it's not proper. We wouldn't allow it for any other parade in San Francisco, and it should not be allowed for the gay parade.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	It came in the mail today.
M	HARVEY MILK	"You get the first bullet the minute you stand at the microphone." Looks like the publicity's working.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	You don't have to go up there.
M	HARVEY MILK	It could happen any day, any night, any time... The nation's eye is on us. I have to do this. JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you. I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy. Brothers and sisters, you must come out. Come out to your parents. I know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth! Come out to your friends, if they indeed are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers. Once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake. For the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On the Statue of Liberty it says "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free." In the Declaration of Independence it is written "All men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights." For Mr. Briggs and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from the Declaration of Independence. No matter how hard you try, you cannot chip those words from off the base of the Statue of Liberty. That is what America is. Love it or leave it. Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A
M	CLEVE JONES	The Mayor says Briggs is on his way here. He could intercept him for us. We could get him face to face. He couldn't ignore us anymore.
M	HARVEY MILK	Get the press.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	The parade is the other direction.
M	DRIVER	They're taking us another way, Sir. It's a showdown... HIGH NOON.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	I'm afraid it's not in the interest of your safety, or my public's safety to let you into that parade grounds. Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
M	HARVEY MILK	Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.
M	HARVEY MILK	No sir. I would love to have a public debate. I'm very interested in the details of your argument.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	You know the details. As do the people. Look at the votes across this nation. The "public" is with me.
M	HARVEY MILK	Yes sir, today they are. But with my City's Mayor and the San Francisco press as my witnesses, I'm challenging you to a public debate. John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets
M	HARVEY MILK	Senator, as a Christian it's interesting that you don't seem to understand what Christ was about. He was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a Bible in one hand and hatred in the other... ...Now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the--
M	JOHN BRIGGS	Not in my mind they haven't--
M	HARVEY MILK	That's it. In your mind they haven't, and I'm wondering why--
M	JOHN BRIGGS	Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal. But it's not illegal to be a homosexual in California.
M	HARVEY MILK	And your law goes even further. Any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired--
M	JOHN BRIGGS	True. But, gay people don't have children of their own. If they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away. That's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them.
M	HARVEY MILK (ON TV)	How do you teach homosexuality? Like French? I was born of heterosexual parents, I was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society. So then why am I homosexual? And no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their
M	HARVEY MILK (ON TV) (CONT'D)	teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around. The audience eats it up. It feel like "The Harvey Milk Show."
M	JOHN BRIGGS	If they're going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them, those people are going to be in danger of being removed their job.
M	HARVEY MILK	We were really genuinely frightened by Proposition Six, and with the backlash gaining strength, we were very pessimistic. We didn't think there was any chance we could beat it. What we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose, there would be a revolt... That all hell would break lose.
M	DICK PABICH	People are coming out, though. We met with groups in Bakersfield, Redding, a dozen people showed up in a library basement in Fresno asking for our support if they came out. Last Sunday, the Reverend of St. Mary's came out to his entire congregation...
M	HARVEY MILK	We're still losing, 60 to 30. We have to take the show on the road. Call Briggs's office. Do a press release. Tell them he can pick the town, the audience, and I'll ask our supporters not to attend.
M	DICK PABICH	Their audiences are insanely devout. We'll get killed.
M	HARVEY MILK	Get me Orange County.
M	JACK LIRA	You just have to go down to LA and guess the right things on TV and they'll pay us... You have to use your fame now while you have it. We could have nice things.
M	HARVEY MILK	I don't have time to do game shows right now... This stops Jack cold.
M	JACK LIRA	You are horrible! I have worked on this surprise for you for weeks!
M	HARVEY MILK	Are you drunk right now?
M	JACK LIRA	You are an ungrateful asshole!
M	HARVEY MILK	Jack, I'll have more time soon.
M	JACK LIRA	You're ashamed of me!
M	HARVEY MILK	That's not true. I think you're smart. You're capable. No matter what your family or your father said. I believe in you... We should figure out something for you to do. I could get you a job.
M	JACK LIRA	I'll never be good enough for you! Jack THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY. It misses, CRASHING
M	HARVEY MILK	I'll get a broom. Harvey goes. Jack collapses into a chair.
M	HARVEY MILK	If in your statements here you say that child molestation is not an issue, why do you put out literature that hammers it home, why do you play on that myth and fear?
M	JOHN BRIGGS	Same thing with VD Harvey, we put out publications about VD so you can avoid it.
M	HARVEY MILK	But you've even admitted that there's more molestation in the heterosexual group! So why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers? Boos from the conservative audience.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	We are not talking about homos... child molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual. If we took heterosexuals out AND homosexuals out, you know what--
M	JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK	--we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--
M	HARVEY MILK	--No child molestation... So you're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation?
M	JOHN BRIGGS	No, no, I'm not saying that at all--
M	HARVEY MILK	That's what you just said.
M	JOHN BRIGGS	No. I'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group-- Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs
M	HARVEY MILK	--Sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed? How many lives will you destroy in your lust for power, and when will you stop? The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It
M	DAN WHITE	All I'm really saying is, if we don't protect ourselves with this kind of legislation, a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they can't refuse to hire him.
M	HARVEY MILK	Hey Jack, what's wrong?
M	JACK LIRA	Nothing. I just want to know when you'll be home.
M	HARVEY MILK	You just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog shit ordinance. Did you do this on purpose, Jack?
M	JACK LIRA	It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more important than poop?
M	HARVEY MILK	Yes, but... I don't know when I'll be home. Maybe 6. 6:15.
M	JACK LIRA	Fine. 6:15. Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in
M	HARVEY MILK	Dan? How's the baby?
M	DAN WHITE	You didn't bring up Supervisor pay raises. In fact, I heard you plan to publicly oppose them.
M	HARVEY MILK	I heard you planned to vote against them too, Dan. Were you trying to set me up?
M	DAN WHITE	
M	DAN WHITE (CONT'D)	It's not a good time for me to bring it up. Politically.
M	HARVEY MILK	Dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and I'll consider backing pay raises.
M	DAN WHITE	I don't trade votes... unlike you, the way I was raised, we believe in right and wrong. Moral and immoral.
M	HARVEY MILK	Black skin and White in your police department? Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out against Proposition Six. You're looking more and more out of touch.
M	DAN WHITE	If I come out against Prop Six, it's only for the invasion of State's rights issue.
M	HARVEY MILK	And the potential witch hunts against you "straight people," right? Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response. He can't.
M	DAN WHITE	You underestimate me, Milk. You're very, very wrong about me.
M	HARVEY MILK	I don't know what you mean. A moment. Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	What is it, Dan? You can tell me.
M	DAN WHITE	You don't... You can't humiliate me. And you will not demean me. Anne appears down the hall. Dan has more on his mind, but the
M	PASSERBY	You're the asshole that just passed that dog shit thing aren't you? What the hell do you have against dogs?
M	HARVEY MILK	Sir, blind people can't see "shit." What the heck do you have against blind people? The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at HARVEY CAN'T MOVE. He is mesmerized... horrified.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You did everything you could.
M	HARVEY	No, I didn't. Not everything...
M	SCOTT SMITH	What else could you have done?
M	HARVEY	I could have come home at six o'clock, not six-fifteen. Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.
M	CLEVE JONES	"Beware. The ides. Of November."
M	HARVEY MILK	Jack was gone. I didn't have time to mourn... There was no choice but to keep on... to keep fighting.
M	HARVEY MILK	Thank you for this great honor. But do you think once the magazine is done snapping pictures, maybe I could keep the suit for a while?
M	HARVEY MILK	Would you like to trade with me?
M	GIRL	No. What the heck are you?
M	HARVEY MILK	Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I run this city. He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower
M	DICK PABICH	San Bernadino is coming in. Not good.
M	HARVEY MILK	Of course not. How not good?
M	MICHAEL WONG	60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.
M	HARVEY MILK	Dear God, little Lotus Blossom. Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar
M	JIM RIVALDO	Imperial is 69% "for" so far.
M	HARVEY MILK	Put it up on the board. Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
M	HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)	The whole world is watching this. This is San Francisco we're about to lose. Are you ready?
M	CLEVE JONES	I can have 15,000 people in an hour. But there's gonna be riots if this thing passes.
M	HARVEY MILK	There goddamn better be.
M	CLEVE JONES	What are you telling me?
M	HARVEY MILK	I can't say it because I'm a public official, but for God's sake, if this thing passes, fight back. Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.
M	ANNE KRONENBERG	Don Amador down in LA.
M	HARVEY	Kind of a bad time, Don.
M	YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)	No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave me the phone.
M	HARVEY MILK	Paul who?
M	YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)	You talked to me on the phone a year or so ago. I'm from Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair. REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end.
M	HARVEY MILK	I thought you were a goner, Paul.
M	YOUNG TEEN	I'm sorry. I should have called. When I read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat, I got a friend to put me on a bus to LA.
M	HARVEY MILK	Who did you know in Los Angeles?
M	YOUNG TEEN	Nobody. That's the uh... I just didn't want to die anymore, sir. I met your friend Don down here. I turned 18. I voted today against Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk.
M	HARVEY MILK	No. You did this all by yourself.
M	YOUNG TEEN	I don't think I'd be alive right now without you, sir. You were right about LA. It's like gay Disney World.
M	HARVEY MILK	Then you have to see San Francisco!
M	YOUNG TEEN	Okay. I will. Don wanted me to um... congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk. Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in
M	DON AMADOR (V.O.)	It looks like we've taken LA County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge.
M	HARVEY MILK	I gotta go, Don. Thank you. LA by 65% put it up! Put it up! The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms up.
M	JIM RIVALDO	The polls were off. Briggs is going down by more than 2 to 1. The only district where it's leading in San Francisco is Dan White's. Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne, Dick & Jim,
M	HARVEY MILK	Well crap Cleve, now what are we going to do tonight?! Cover up Lady Liberty. The cameras will be coming our way.
M	HARVEY MILK	To the gay community all over this state... my message to you is... so far a lot of people joined us and rejected Proposition Six, and now we owe them something... We must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them. We must continue to speak out... and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out. Tonight... Tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us. And now that they do, they see we are not sick... they can feel we are not wrong... and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world... A message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there... to all those afraid of this wave of hate... to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns... tonight we know there is a place for us! My brothers and sisters... we can come home again! The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto
M	CLEVE JONES	What's the matter?
M	HARVEY MILK	You ever heard of sore losers? Well, I'm a sore winner... I thought we were goners. I'd started looking forward to the riots.
M	CLEVE JONES	I told you, I don't "do" losing.
M	HARVEY MILK	I think maybe we're best with our backs to the wall. It's too quiet. I think we should march on Washington D.C. next year.
M	CLEVE JONES	Milk, you're a decent politician, a mediocre businessman, but you're a lousy gay man. Take some time off. Fifty's right around the corner. Nobody will want you after that... I can handle D.C.
M	HARVEY MILK	The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.
M	CLEVE JONES	They did. There's nowhere to march tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go back inside. Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son
M	DAN WHITE	Could you give this to the Mayor for me? As soon as possible.
M	HARVEY MILK	Morning, Dan.
M	DAN WHITE	I just resigned. Congratulations. I'm sure you're pleased. Harvey doesn't know what to say. Dan's right, it does make
M	DAN WHITE (CONT'D)	You'll be the next President of the Board.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'm sure we could work together-- Dan walks away from Harvey. He doesn't want to hear anything Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER
M	OFFICER	Hey, Dan. Just got word. Can we talk to you for a minute?
M	DAN WHITE	Sure... Dan heads for his office.
M	OFFICER	Downstairs. The Association meeting room... Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to
M	DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)	Most people were surprised when Dan White quit last Friday citing financial difficulties. Now we've heard that White is asking for his Supervisor job back. But many say-- --White gave up all of his political chits when he resigned without making any arrangements. The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up. The city of San Francisco is in disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have been found thus far in Jonestown, Guyana. Leader of the People's Temple, Jim Jones...
M	DAN WHITE	It was a major decision on Friday that I had to come... to arrive at. But since that time, people unknown to me, plus my family and friends, have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office, that they support me... So I'm asking the Mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people...
M	HARVEY MILK	He gets dragged into a closed door meeting with the Police Officers Association, and comes out demanding his job back? What do you think they promised him? Or worse, how did they threaten him?
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	A man has the right to change his mind. Give me some peace.
M	HARVEY MILK	How many of our propositions has Dan shut down? We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense. Cement rent control. It's his vote on this Board that stands in our way.
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied all week. Enough.
M	HARVEY MILK	Let me just remind you that you're up for re-election. If you re- appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote. They listen to me. You won't get elected dog catcher.
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	I'll make my decision on Monday. You know what you sounded like just now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.
M	HARVEY MILK	A "homosexual" with a bit of power... rather scary isn't it, Mr. Mayor? OFF Harvey. He's come a long way. ON STAGE IT'S "O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!" Refusing
M	DAN WHITE	Yes. This is Dan White.
M	KCBS REPORTER (V.O.)	I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I'm interested in your reaction. I've received information from the Mayor's office that you won't be getting your job back.
M	DAN WHITE	I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. Dan hangs up on her.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Hello? REVEAL: Scott, half asleep.
M	HARVEY MILK	Sorry to wake you up.
M	SCOTT SMITH	What's wrong?
M	HARVEY MILK	I went to the opera tonight. Guess who my date was.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Who?
M	HARVEY MILK	Bidu Sayao herself. She was in the first Puccini I ever saw. The crowd went wild. It was like I was young again, seeing my first live opera...
M	SCOTT SMITH	If you go to the opera again, you should call me.
M	HARVEY MILK	Really? Scott gets out of bed, considers his words. It's intimate.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Yes. I'd go with you.
M	HARVEY MILK	I'd like that. Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection. An unexpected
M	SCOTT SMITH	Harvey?
M	HARVEY MILK	Look out the window, the sun's coming up.
M	SCOTT SMITH	It's late. You should get some sleep.
M	HARVEY MILK	I don't want to miss it.
M	SCOTT SMITH	Miss what?
M	HARVEY MILK	This. Harvey's single word answer means, "Life."
M	MAN	Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--
M	DAN WHITE	My aide was supposed to come down here and let me in the side door, but she never showed up.
M	MAN	And you are?
M	DAN WHITE	I'm Dan White. City Supervisor. We follow Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.
M	HARVEY MILK	Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing Dan with that God Damned liberal lefty Don Horanzy? That'll really shake up the Board, huh?
M	DIANNE FEINSTEIN	All I know is that we're getting a new Supervisor today. If Dan shows up, just avoid him. We don't need a scene today, right Harvey?
M	HARVEY MILK	Heaven forbid, Dianne.
M	DAN WHITE	You can't take this away from me! Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.
M	MAYOR MOSCONE	The issue is what's fair, for the people of your district. Take some time off. Spend it with your family. Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.)	This time next year we're marching on Washington D.C. It'll look like Market and Castro, but with a million people. Write that down. Tell President Carter we're coming after him next. I'm going to deposit this. I'll be back in 20 minutes. Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND,
M	DAN WHITE	Say, Harve, can I see you for a minute?
M	HARVEY MILK	Sure. Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.
M	HARVEY MILK	Oh no... N-- Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help. Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Last week I got a phone call--
M	HARVEY	--from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the voice was quite young, and the person said... "Thanks." You've got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know there's hope... hope for a better world...
M	SCOTT SMITH	Where is everybody? Didn't anyone give a damn?
M	HARVEY MILK	I ask this... If there should be an assassination, I would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise. I would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out-- --If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door... And that's all. I ask for the movement to continue. Because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power... it's about the "us's" out there. Not only gays, but the Blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's. Without hope, the us's give up-- As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place
M	HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	--I know you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living. So you, and you, and you...
M	HARVEY MILK	You gotta give em' hope... you gotta give em' hope. Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes
