M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	GIGI (V.O.)	I have a theory about how this all started...
M	LITTLE GIRL	Why did you do that?
M	LITTLE BOY	Because you smell like dog poo.
M	LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)	You're so stupid just like dog poo! You're made of poo!
M	LITTLE GIRL	Made. (SOB) Of. (SOB) Dog. (SOB) Poo.
M	MOM	Honey, do you know why that little boy did those things? And said those things? Because he LIKES YOU. Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL? Where did that rumor start? Because moms have been spreading it for years.
M	MOM	That little boy is doing those terrible things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU. Do you understand what this means? We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood.
M	GIGI (V.O.)	Then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same...
M	ROOMMATE #1	That Phi Delt so obviously liked you. I'm sure he just lost your number.
M	SECRETARY	He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity.
M	CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1	Here's the problem. He likes you TOO much. You're TOO pretty and awesome. He can't handle it.
M	CASHIER #1	Trust me. It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.
M	MIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1	Trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship. Shigeru's inability to commit clearly stems from his failure to properly imprint on his mother during breast feeding.
M	FRIEND (SUBTITLE)	I'm sure he forgot your hut number. Or didn't get enough approval from his father. Or was eaten by a giraffe.
M	GIGI (V.O.)	Why do we say this stuff to each other? Why do we tell each other these lies? Is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face?
F	GIGI	So, Janine told me you're a real estate agent.
M	CONOR	Yeah. But don't worry - not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus
F	GIGI	So just like on frisbees and notepads?
M	CONOR	You got it.
F	GIGI	Much classier.
M	CONOR	My thoughts exactly.
F	GIGI	I wonder why Janine never thought of introducing us before?
M	CONOR	Yeah, I don't know, I ummm -
M	WAITRESS	You guys ready for another round?
M	CONOR	You want one more?
F	GIGI	Only if you do. But I mean, if you have to get going I totally ...
M	CONOR	Umm. OK. Sure. One more. You had Ketel and soda, right?
F	GIGI	Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
M	CONOR	Yeah. It was really nice meeting you.
F	GIGI	B-bye. Hey, it's me. He's cute. I think it went well. And I think he might me leaving me a message at home as - we - speak.
M	CONOR	Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you.
F	ANNA	Conor, that's so nice. Thank you.
M	BEN	Do you want to go ahead?
F	ANNA	Hmm?
M	BEN	Go ahead? You've only got two things.
F	ANNA	Hold on.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	You've only got one thing.
M	BEN	Well, technically it's six. And I'm still mulling over a gum purchase. So...
F	ANNA	Hey, let me call you right back.
M	EMOTIONLESS CASHIER	Oh my word.
F	ANNA	Come on. Seriously. I just deposited money today. There's no way -
M	EMOTIONLESS CASHIER	It's not that. Let me check something. Congratulations. You won.
F	ANNA	What? EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Our "Sizzlin' Summer" promotion. You're our 1000th customer in June.
F	ANNA	Are you kidding?
M	EMOTIONLESS CASHIER	Do I have that kind of manner? A joking manner?
F	ANNA	I swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.
M	BEN	Really?
F	ANNA	Is that sad?
M	BEN	No, it's - charming. Congratulations.
F	ANNA	Wait, no. I can't accept this. You were here first. I didn't win at all.
M	BEN	Yes, you did. Trust me - it's fate. You were meant to have that cooler.
F	ANNA	Thank you SO MUCH.
M	ALEX	Hey. How was the date?
M	CONOR	Fine. You know.
M	CONOR (CONT'D)	Why are you here? My cable's out.
M	CONOR	You didn't hear the phone ring, did you?
M	ALEX	Nope.
M	CONOR	Shit. Anna gave me the "I'll call you right back."
M	ALEX	How long ago?
M	CONOR	22 minutes.
M	ALEX	Sorry, dude.
M	CONOR	Do I call back? I know. I'll call back and say that I'm going to bed.
M	ALEX	At 9:30 PM? Genius.
M	CONOR	It is genius. Because then I can say: "In case you were going to call me back - don't - 'cause I'll be sleeping."
M	ALEX	Sounds foolproof.
F	ANNA	Sorry. What was I saying?
M	BEN	I think you were telling me how you don't want to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didn't pursue your dreams.
F	ANNA	Was I? Little intense for grocery store chatter. Sorry.
M	BEN	It's OK. I might even be able to help you out. There's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients.
F	ANNA	That would be - amazing. What are you - like my savior?
M	BEN	OK. Look. I'm married. I don't do this.
F	ANNA	Don't do what? Help struggling singers?
M	BEN	Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming.
F	ANNA	Do you want to give me your card? That's legit. I bet you're allowed to do that.
M	BEN	Right. OK. I guess that would be OK.
M	NEIL	So, who was that?
M	BEN	A prospective client.
M	NEIL	Yeah right.
M	BEN	I can talk to a woman Neil. It doesn't have to be like that.
M	BEN (CONT'D)	Just drive.
M	NEIL	Hey, babe. You here?
F	BETH	Hey honey.
M	NEIL	Everything OK?
F	BETH	Yeah. Just got off the phone.
M	NEIL	You want some tea or something?
F	BETH	It was my baby sister. She's getting married.
M	NEIL	That's great. I've always liked that Devon guy. That's really great.
F	BETH	Do you think it's great?
M	NEIL	Yeah.
F	BETH	So, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married?
M	NEIL	No, babe.
M	NEIL (CONT'D)	Going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey. We're just two people who aren't married.
F	BETH	Right.
M	NEIL	I actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married. Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking.
F	BETH	Yeah, I know. I get that.
M	NEIL	Like I've always told you - I love you - and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship.
F	BETH	Yeah.
M	NEIL	Lemme get you some tea.
F	JANINE	OK, so clearly he hasn't called. Maybe he's away on business.
F	GIGI	He sells real estate. In Baltimore. Staying in town is his business.
F	JANINE	Right.
M	JANINE (CONT'D)	Look, let me tell you - after the first time I went out with Ben, he didn't call me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And now he's like the world's best husband. That happens all the time.
F	GIGI	Really?
F	JANINE	Yes, really.
F	GIGI	This is all your fault.
F	JANINE	What? Why?
F	GIGI	You set me up with him.
F	JANINE	No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number. That's not a set up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons. I do my due diligence. All I know about Conor is he sold us this house.
F	GIGI	He sold you a house in the ghetto.
F	JANINE	It's a neighborhood "in transition."
M	JANINE (CONT'D)	Seriously, stop.
F	GIGI	He said he always hangs at Red Maple after work. Maybe I should do a little drive-by?
F	JANINE	Please, don't. He'll call.
F	AMBER	Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Total invasion of my personal freedom. When a guy doesn't call me, it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up several thousand times. Or at least until his mother shouts at me in Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone. I mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers - and who is AT& Next thing you know, someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics. I mean, a girl deserves freedom of expression, right?
F	GIGI	Mom, I gotta call you back.
F	JANINE	So, this was at the end of the date, or at the beginning? End. Why - does it matter?
F	JANINE	Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal. "Nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off.
F	GIGI	Maybe it was at the beginning.
F	JANINE	Then that's fine. He's gonna call. Or maybe it was at the end. Or maybe it was nice to meet me.
F	JANINE	Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice to meet you"?
F	GIGI	Shit. I can't remember.
F	JANINE	"Nice to meet you" is OK. "Nice meeting you" is like "Do you want your receipt in the bag?"
F	BETH	Remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when I came in? Janine, how's the press release?
F	JANINE	Beckon the baking to begin! McCormick, the flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas!
F	BETH	Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - but otherwise good. Where are we with the company newsletter?
F	GIGI	I am so almost done with that. It's just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research, when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to call me.
F	BETH	Look, after my first date with Neil, I called him. There are no rules anymore. Why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?
F	GIGI	It's ringing.
F	JANINE	Pretty standard.
F	GIGI	Yes! Voicemail.
F	JANINE	Your notes.
F	GIGI	Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought, I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?
M	GIGI (CONT'D)	I mean, we're all equal, right? More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people - - I mean I don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right? Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me.
F	JANINE	Don't worry. He's totally gonna call.
F	GIGI	WHAT? How can there be no dial tone?
M	GIGI (CONT'D)	Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now. I'll call you back.
M	GIGI (CONT'D)	Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want to stop me.
M	KELLI ANN	Knock knock.
M	ALEX	Hey.
M	KELLI ANN	So. Here we are. Same shift again.
M	ALEX	I know. I make the schedule. I figured it was no coincidence.
M	KELLI ANN (CONT'D)	I had fun the other night.
M	ALEX	Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you.
M	KELLI ANN	Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight after work...we could, you know...
M	ALEX	Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun. But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you. To work. So... Are we good here?
M	KELLI ANN	No. We're good.
M	TYRONE	Dude.
M	ALEX	I know.
M	KELLI ANN	Are you joining us for dinner or -
F	GIGI	I'm meeting someone. A guy.
M	KELLI ANN	Ugh. Why?
F	GIGI	Hmmmm?
M	KELLI ANN	Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?
F	GIGI	I'm meeting someone.
M	KELLI ANN	I believe you mentioned that.
F	GIGI	I'm gonna wait at the bar.
M	KELLI ANN	That's a great idea.
M	ALEX	What can I get you?
F	GIGI	Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone.
M	ALEX	Oh, yeah? Got a hot date?
F	GIGI	I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I mean this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so --
M	ALEX	Wait - Conor Barry?
F	GIGI	Oh, uhh, yeah --
M	ALEX	Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he forget he was supposed to meet you?
F	GIGI	See when I said "meeting someone" I guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-
M	ALEX	Because I could just call him --
F	GIGI	NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I mean, I actually was just - in the area - so I figured I'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh ---
M	GIGI (CONT'D)	I uhh, had to return his -- Pen. I had to return this - pen. He left this. So, I thought I should really return it before he - you know - -- freaks out.
M	ALEX	Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry.
F	GIGI	Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone.
M	ALEX	That's not even his dentist.
F	GIGI	Oh, really? Then who's his dentist?
M	ALEX	My dad.
F	GIGI	I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last week. And I just...I thought if I ran into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go.
M	ALEX	Hey. Just - hang out for a second. Lemme buy you a drink.
M	ALEX	Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you.
F	GIGI	Oh really? How do you know?
M	ALEX	Because I'm a guy. It's how we do it. He said it was nice meeting me.
M	ALEX	I don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by - and he didn't call.
F	GIGI	But maybe he called me and I didn't get the message. Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died.
M	ALEX	Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.
F	GIGI	Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him --
M	ALEX	Your friend Terri's an idiot. And she's the exception.
F	GIGI	OK. But what if I'm the exception?
M	ALEX	You're not. You're the rule. And the rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you.
F	GIGI	Really? Always?
M	ALEX	Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a woman looks like. I do it early and I do it often. Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit - - he doesn't. No exceptions.
F	GIGI	Why are you telling me all of this? Aren't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf?
M	ALEX	I don't know. You looked like you could really use the help.
F	GIGI	Thank you. You've given me a lot to think about.
F	JANINE	Everything OK?
F	GIGI	I was up all night.
F	JANINE	Please say you were working on the newsletter. Sure. It's basically done. But this is important.
F	JANINE	What's happening with your hair? Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair.
F	GIGI	I think I figured it out. Remember when I went out with that notary public? And he cheated on me? And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love.
F	BETH	I thought that guy was a process server.
F	GIGI	No, notary. Anyway, the point is - Anastasia is the exception. Not the rule. We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much.
F	BETH	Okay...
F	GIGI	Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space. He only used me for rides, yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998. Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free. I was so delusional about our relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist. And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after. But that's the exception. And we're not the exception - we're the rule.
F	BETH	OK. So let me see if I understand. What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception. And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married.
F	GIGI	No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was just talking, you know, about me. Specifically.
F	ANNA	It is impossible not to like this guy. I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie's, and then he tells me he's married. You'd think I'd be pissed, but I literally could not stop myself from liking him.
F	MARY	But he's married.
F	ANNA	I realize that. I keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that doesn't cool it off. What is my problem?
F	MARY	OK. There was this guy who worked in my dad's printing business. Married for fifteen years to a nice lady. And then he meets this woman at some church event. And he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before. I mean, he had finally met the love of his life. So, he divorced his wife, and he's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy. I mean, what if you meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else? Are you supposed to pass them by?
F	ANNA	You're right. I'm calling him. Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks. Hey, Anna. What's up?
F	ANNA	Well, I was just taking you up on your offer. You said you might know someone who could help me out and I thought we could discuss it -- over coffee? Look, I just...I can't Anna. You seem great. It's just - I don't know. I should go. Take care.
M	CONOR	I am so psyched that you called.
F	ANNA	Cool.
M	CONOR	I had sort of given up on you when you didn't call me back the other night.
F	ANNA	Well, you know. I was just thinking about you.
F	ANNA	Your turn.
M	CONOR	OK. Give me the categories again.
F	ANNA	There are four. Sexy, smart, funny or cute. And each person can only be two. Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and sexy. Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart.
M	CONOR	I love that you are hot for Clinton.
F	ANNA	So, which am I?
M	CONOR	What was I again?
F	ANNA	Smart and cute.
M	CONOR	OK. You're sexy. Very sexy. And cute.
F	ANNA	No. Cute and sexy are in the looks column. No one wants to be in all one column.
M	CONOR	Well, I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four. But you're so obviously all four. Especially sexy.
F	ANNA	You're the best.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I better go.
M	CONOR	Oh. OK. I mean, you could just stay here tonight. What? It's been a while.
F	ANNA	I know. It's just - I'm fried. Is that alright?
M	CONOR	Sure. Of course.
M	NEIL	Hey babe, is this straight?
F	BETH	Why are you hanging that?
M	NEIL	I told you I'd do it weeks ago. You don't like it there?
F	BETH	I love it there. But just - stop.
M	NEIL	It's the image, isn't it? I didn't see it before, but - you're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob. You want me to take it down?
F	BETH	No. I want you stop doing anything nice.
M	NEIL	Is this a trick? No. I need you to stop being nice to me - unless you're gonna marry me after. Is that funny?
M	NEIL	No. It was just - I was just--
F	BETH	See, you can't keep being nice to me and I can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not. We've been together over seven years. You know me. You either want to marry me or you don't.
M	NEIL	Or there is the possibility that I just don't really believe in the concept of -
F	BETH	BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every woman who's been told by some guy that he doesn't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym. Bullshit.
M	NEIL	Honey, where is all this coming from? From the place that I have been hiding from you for the last five years because I didn't want to seem demanding, or clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never ask. But now I'm going to --- Are you ever going to marry me?
M	BETH (CONT'D)	I can't do this anymore.
M	AMY	I was with Damon for six years. He asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that. Said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't that a cute name? Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off. And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts. I left him.
M	BEN	Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know it's been a little while since you called. I just - it took me by surprise. But I offered to help you with your career, and I don't see why I can't do that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe you can come by the office this week or something. Okay, take care. Bye.
F	JANINE	Hey, how --
M	BEN	Shit - you scared me. Is everything OK?
M	BEN	Yeah. Everything's fine. Why?
F	JANINE	Are you smoking again?
M	BEN	No, sweetie. Why?
F	JANINE	Well - you get jumpy when you smoke.
M	BEN	I'm not smoking. So, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening?
F	JANINE	I don't know - I was thinking maybe - pink?
M	BEN	Pink? Seriously?
F	JANINE	Well, I mean, at some point.
M	BEN	You sure we're ready for this now?
F	JANINE	No. But I mean, we could paint one room pink and one blue just in case.
M	BEN	You've already created the perfect family in this house, and we don't even have drywall.
F	JANINE	I'm sorry. I know I promised we'd wait to talk about it -
M	BEN	I think we're almost ready to start talking about it.
F	JANINE	I've always liked the name Gisele.
M	JARRAD	Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office. You go back to the office after happy hour? What's happy about that? I met you. Janine and Gigi melt. So, I'd love to call you sometime. Do you have a card? Of course. And here's my info.
M	JARRAD (CONT'D)	Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.
F	GIGI	So, wait -- how are we doing this? Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call? Jarrad turns back.
M	JARRAD	What?
F	GIGI	You said you'd love to call me, but then you said "look forward to hearing from you." See how that's kinda confusing?
M	JARRAD	Look - we'll talk. We'll get in touch.
F	GIGI	Ooopsie - you did it again. Very vague. You know what? Why don't we just say that you'll call me, and then we can skip all the nonsense. Or I guess I could just call you --
M	JARRAD	Goodbye, Gigi.
F	GIGI	He was cute.
F	JANINE	Please don't cyber-stalk him. Wait - what are you doing?
F	GIGI	I'm not calling him. If he wants to see me - he'll call.
F	JANINE	Wow, that guy Alex really made an impression on you. Was he hot?
F	GIGI	No. He was just -- right.
M	BRUCE	So?
F	MARY	He asked me out.
M	NATHAN	Oh my god! He called?
F	MARY	Well -
M	JOSHUA	He emailed?
F	MARY	Umm -
M	BRUCE	What? Did he travel by carriage and leave his calling card with your lady in waiting?
F	MARY	He MySpaced me.
M	NATHAN	Ouch.
M	JOSHUA	I don't know. My slutty sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
F	MARY	Well, what am I supposed to do? Things have changed. People don't just meet organically anymore. If I want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I update my profile. That's just how it is. Back to work.
M	MARY (CONT'D)	Ad sales - this is Mary.
M	CONOR	Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend. Or whatever.
F	MARY	Hey. So, did you see it?
M	CONOR	I'm not sure about this.
F	MARY	You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning market. You're gonna make a fortune.
M	CONOR	Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads?
F	MARY	It was either that or on the page with the personals. I made a call.
M	CONOR	OK. You're right. Hey, have you talked to Anna lately?
F	CATHERINE	I do not understand how you got mom to sew all of these in two weeks.
F	PAIGE	She wanted to do it.
F	LAURA	Mom told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweatshop.
F	PAIGE	No, she didn't.
F	BETH	Why again do you need to get married so fast?
F	CATHERINE	You're so pregnant.
F	PAIGE	I'm not pregnant.
F	CATHERINE	Chug a beer, then. I want to see you chug a beer.
F	PAIGE	We're in love, you assholes. That's what people do when they're in love - they get married. Bethie, you know I didn't mean --
F	BETH	It's OK. Neil and I are actually - done - anyway.
F	CATHERINE	Why didn't you tell us? You should have told us.
F	LAURA	You have to come over and have dinner with me and Steven and the kids tonight, OK? You can even stay over if you want.
F	CATHERINE	Why would she want to hang out with us and our husbands? Seriously, Beth, isn't that exactly what you want to avoid right now? But before Beth can even answer -- You know what - if being in the wedding is too painful-
F	BETH	You guys, it's cool. I'm fine. So I lost a little time. Big deal.
F	CATHERINE	So not a big deal. You're still really young.
F	PAIGE	So young.
F	LAURA	Everything you learned in that relationship is just gonna make the next one so much stronger.
F	BETH	Exactly.
F	LAURA	She wasted so much time.
F	CATHERINE	I knew he was never gonna propose.
F	PAIGE	Shit.
M	BEN	I know it's here somewhere. I spoke to George Lane in music, and he gave me this whole list of references for you.
F	ANNA	It's cool. You can call me when you find it.
M	BEN	I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
F	ANNA	I know. But a girl can dream. You're obviously too good of a guy. Why are you married, again? Seriously. Why? It'll be good for me. Tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman.
M	BEN	We'd been together since college. She gave me an ultimatum: we get married or we break up. So, we got married.
F	ANNA	Seriously? You just caved?
M	BEN	It's complicated.
F	ANNA	Really?
M	BEN	You're a dick if you date a girl for too long, and don't marry her. But you marry her, and then you're an asshole for marrying her before you're ready. Shit - I don't know. He looks at her. You're really hot and I'm obviously attracted to you, but I guess the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper, and call you, and hope I help in some small way with your career, and be happy about that.
F	GIGI	Hi, this is Gigi.
M	ALEX	Gigi?
F	GIGI	Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist pen.
M	ALEX	Right.
F	GIGI	I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I thought you had some really good insights the other night and -- I had a question.
M	ALEX	Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor is never going to be interested in you.
F	GIGI	No, I know. This is about - - Jarrad. You have a sec?
M	ALEX	Okay...
F	GIGI	So I meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming --
M	ALEX	Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you.
F	GIGI	He may have used some derivative of that. So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and --
M	ALEX	He's not interested.
F	GIGI	You don't even know if he called --
M	ALEX	Did he?
F	GIGI	No. But the thing is, I honestly think he's expecting my call. He said "Look forward to hearing from you" and not "Look forward to talking to you." I mean, do you hear the connotations?
M	ALEX	He. Is. Not. Interested.
M	TYRONE	Alex - this is jacked. The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a white shirt -- this shirt is WHITE!
M	TYRONE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	This shit is white.
M	ALEX	If a guy gives you his phone number, instead of taking yours, he's not interested.
F	GIGI	He took mine first, but then he --
M	ALEX	And, if a guy wants to see you, he will see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's until I got the right one.
F	GIGI	That's cute. What happened?
M	ALEX	As it turned out, her ass looked really huge in daylight. Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
M	ALEX	Don't call him. He doesn't like you.
F	GIGI	Again with the sensitivity.
M	ALEX	Just trying to help.
F	GIGI	I know. Thanks.
M	MAYA	Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me anything.
F	ANNA	Mom - you always say that and I always get you something.
M	MAYA	You didn't.
F	ANNA	It's no big deal. What is it?
M	CONOR (CONT'D)	Tim Buckley. Nice.
M	MAYA	Here - put on my favorite. Did Anna ever tell you I knew Tim Buckley?
M	CONOR	No. She did not.
M	MAYA	We met at a coffee shop in 1971. Hell's Kitchen. I had no idea who he was. But he had this big mop of hair and these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at the same time. Complete interest and disinterest. It was amazing.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	Of course, I was with Anna's father at the time, so, you know...another opportunity missed.
F	ANNA	Mom, please -
M	MAYA	It's the truth. I knew them all. Robert Plant, Harry Nilsson, Graham Parsons... Have you seen the pictures of me from when I was Anna's age?
M	CONOR	Umm - I don't think so -
M	MAYA	Sweetie go get that picture - you know the one - Go. Your mother's asking you to do something for her on her birthday. You'll see - we look strikingly similar. My lips may be a bit fuller, but...
M	CONOR	Wow. That's - unbelievable.
M	MAYA	So that's what we're dealing with here, for reference. Imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee shop.
M	CONOR	That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I kinda did. Anna and I met at a restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not a coffee shop, but...still -
M	MAYA	That's sweet. But if we're comparing stories - She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley. Anyone need a refill?
F	ANNA	Thanks again for coming with me. You make it so much easier.
M	CONOR	Are you kidding? I like your mom. She's cool.
F	ANNA	Yeah, well - cool's not always what you're looking for in a mom.
M	CONOR	So, you want another -- foot rub?
F	ANNA	Ugh. I'm just beat. I wanna put on sweats and get in bed.
M	CONOR	I'd be into that.
F	ANNA	I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
M	TRENT	If a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you. And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you. I guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early - so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen. So, I've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course. A girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not scientific - but I'm just saying - you were warned.
M	ALEX	Hey dude - you here? Yep.
M	ALEX	Wanna beer? Or an apple martini?
M	CONOR	Funny. Need I ask?
M	CONOR	It's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base.
M	ALEX	By pretending you're gay?
M	CONOR	No. By being more gay friendly.
M	ALEX	Or, in real estate terms, by becoming "gay adjacent".
M	CONOR	Nice. I may have to use that.
M	CONOR (CONT'D)	I'm gonna try something else. This may be too much.
M	ALEX	I don't know. You dress like that - and you're already seeing a girl who won't sleep with you - I think maybe you can pull it off. It's not that she won't sleep with me douchebag...I have slept with her. It's just, you know, she...um...
M	ALEX	Won't sleep with you anymore.
M	CONOR	Pretty much, yeah. So, what do you think?
M	ALEX	I think you're gonna have to beat 'em away with a stick - you hot, sexy man.
F	GIGI	Who would have thought that a random girl from Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser?
M	GREGORY	Back at you sister.
F	GIGI	I can't wait to kiss you again.
M	GREGORY	Umm. We're kissing right now.
F	GIGI	I know. But next time. The second date kiss is way more intimate.
M	GREGORY	Well, I'm going out of town tomorrow - so I'll be out of touch for a bit.
F	GIGI	Would you excuse me a quick second? Too many diet cokes...
M	ALEX	Yup.
F	GIGI	Hey, sorry to bug you again. Quick question.
M	ALEX	Would you excuse me a second, babe?
F	GIGI	I'm making out with a guy - PG stuff - and then he mentions he's going out of town, so he's gonna be out of touch.
M	ALEX	Run. But maybe he is going out of town. To where? The Arab Emirates? Where is he going that he has to be out of touch?
F	GIGI	Where are you going out of town to again? Pittsburgh.
F	GIGI	Pittsburgh.
M	ALEX	Run. So, now what? I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?
M	ALEX	Uhh - yeah.
F	GIGI	There's not going to be anyone left.
M	ALEX	OK, I don't know why I'm saying this - but I actually think I know a nice guy who you might like.
F	GIGI	Yeah?
M	ALEX	Yeah. He's a friend of my brother's. Bill. We'll all meet for a drink - it'll be good.
F	GIGI	So, I'm in his bathroom right now. What do I now?
M	ALEX	You gotta come out eventually. But I'd really take my time. Let him sweat.
M	BEN	So, we ran into each other.
F	ANNA	You came to my class.
M	BEN	I didn't know it was your class.
F	ANNA	You called and asked me.
M	BEN	But you didn't call me back.
F	ANNA	Because you said not to call back if it was my class. Which it was.
M	BEN	We ran into each other.
F	ANNA	Totally. A couple of innocent folks - by happenstance - doing their daily workout near one another.
M	BEN	Exactly. Thank you.
F	ANNA	Wanna swim?
M	BEN	I was just thinking - why can't we be friends? Am I not allowed to make friends anymore? Am I not allowed to be friends with hot people? What kind of reverse prejudice is that?
F	ANNA	I hear you. Am I supposed to not be friends with a guy just because he's married, and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump?
M	BEN	I think I just fell in love. A girl who talks about a dry hump.
F	ANNA	Classy, right?
M	BEN	Classy is lame.
F	ANNA	So, friends, right?
M	BEN	Totally.
F	ANNA	You wanna come in?
M	BEN	I'm sorry. I don't trust myself.
F	ANNA	OK. You can just watch.
M	BEN	You may be the best friend I've ever had.
F	JANINE	Honey - you smell different.
M	BEN	Different how?
F	JANINE	I don't know.
M	BEN	Well that's an odd thing to say.
F	JANINE	Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I found. In the side yard. What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around?
M	BEN	What?
F	JANINE	Do not lie to me, Ben. Please.
M	BEN	Are you serious? We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily. You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine?
F	JANINE	Well, yes.
M	BEN	Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really freaking out. I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on. Just please - relax.
M	NEIL	Ah. My first visitor.
M	BEN	This boat is sick. How come you never invited me out before?
M	NEIL	Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave our jobs. Sell the house. Take off. Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission to board granted. I'll show you around.
M	NEIL	Sorry. It's OK.
M	NEIL	So Janine sent you to check on me?
M	BEN	Yeah. Pretty much.
M	NEIL	Any message from Beth?
M	BEN	I think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so... Her sister's what? Wedding. Her sister's wedding. What did I say? Neil is now LAUGHING HARD.
M	NEIL	You said funeral.
M	BEN	No, I didn't. Shit, did I?
M	NEIL	The marriage thing is weird, man. I never thought Beth would give me an ultimatum.
M	BEN	Really? Why not? That's what women do.
M	NEIL	Right. I forgot. That's how Janine got you to bite the bullet.
M	BEN	Yup.
M	NEIL	Do you regret it?
M	BEN	No.
M	NEIL	So you're happy? You'd say you're happily married?
M	BEN	I love Janine.
M	COUSIN	Now, I know when my cousin Paige says those vows tomorrow, there are going to be hearts breaking all over the world.
M	COUSIN (CONT'D)	So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is still on the market.
M	COUSIN (CONT'D)	Sure, she's an older model, but she's still got a lot of miles left in her. But don't stay on the lot too long, Bethie, or next year's models will --
M	KEN	OK - that's enough of the speeches. Time to eat. So enjoy the crab. And the yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas.
M	KEN (CONT'D)	Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
F	BETH	I know. And even he's married.
M	KEN	So, you'll get married a little bit later than some people. Big deal. You never did anything the way every one else did it, and that's what I've always thought was so great about you.
F	BETH	I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the only one not married. If this was Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to sacrifice me or something.
M	KEN	Honey, look. When everyone else was just going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my New York Times, found some arts camp in the Berkshires, wrote away for information, then got accepted on your own. You were nine. You never did things the way everyone else did.
F	BETH	Why not?
M	KEN	Because that's you. That's why you're my favorite daughter.
F	BETH	I don't think you're supposed to say that.
M	KEN	Well, I don't give a shit. I'm retired, and I'll say what I want. I'll say it into the mic if you want -- That's OK.
M	KEN	It's true, though.
F	BETH	I know.
M	ALEX	Sorry I'm late.
F	GIGI	That's OK. I like a little time before a blind date - prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars --
M	ALEX	He's not coming.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Can't wait to hear that story about the molars, though.
F	GIGI	How can he already not like me?
M	ALEX	I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday, but I meant Tuesday.
F	GIGI	Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
M	ALEX	Nope.
F	GIGI	How do you know?
M	ALEX	See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing. She's interested. He's not.
F	GIGI	You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested.
M	ALEX	Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant. I see this stuff go down every night. Watch --
F	GIGI	Man, you have a gift. And check out droopy dawg on her other side. He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark."
F	GIGI	Maybe there isn't. You need a spark.
M	ALEX	The "spark" thing is bullshit.
F	GIGI	Really? Enlighten me.
M	ALEX	Guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark." And you all buy it. You love it. You all thrive on it because you all love drama.
F	GIGI	I don't.
M	ALEX	Really? So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it?
F	GIGI	Maybe.
M	ALEX	And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
F	GIGI	OK. Yeah.
M	ALEX	See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.
F	GIGI	That's beautiful.
M	ALEX	Thanks.
F	GIGI	Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again? I dunno. I like you.
F	GIGI	You do?
M	ALEX	Don't start doodling my name on your binder. I just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds. They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up.
F	GIGI	Again with the sensitivity.
F	JANINE	It looks good.
M	JAVIER	Yes.
F	JANINE	He does good work.
M	JAVIER	He's very good.
F	JANINE	Javier.
M	JAVIER	Yes.
F	JANINE	Javier, if I asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer?
M	JAVIER	I think so.
F	JANINE	Good. Because I think some of your guys have been - smoking. Javier?
M	JAVIER	Is that the question?
F	JANINE	Yes.
M	JAVIER	Oh. It seemed like a statement.
F	JANINE	The question part was implied -
M	JAVIER	I didn't really hear it in the inflection-
F	JANINE	Javier - have your guys been smoking or not?
M	JAVIER	No, ma'am. My guys don't smoke on the job site. They're all good guys.
F	JANINE	Are you sure your guys aren't sneaking around here? And smoking? And lying to me? And -- smoking?
M	JAVIER	I'm pretty sure.
F	JANINE	I need you to be honest with me, Javier. Because I can't have someone lying to me. To my face. Under my roof. On my time.
M	JAVIER	That's a lot of prepositions...
F	JANINE	I mean, there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there? IS THERE? I mean, we made promises to one another --
M	JANINE (CONT'D)	What I mean is, we had a contract. Which is like making promises to each other, right?
M	JAVIER	Maybe I should just get back to work.
F	JANINE	Yes. Fine. Good idea. But, we're good here, right? Me and you? Okay, great. The molding really does look great.
M	CONOR	Hello, my name is Conor. Please sign in whenever you get a chance.
F	ANNA	This is insane. You're like the Liza Minelli of real estate.
M	CONOR	I know. Your friend Mary's a genius.
F	ANNA	Alright. Gotta run.
M	CONOR	You got a class?
F	ANNA	Uh, no. Just some stuff. See you later?
M	CONOR	Sure. What?
M	SKIP	She's holding out on you, isn't she?
M	CONOR	I'm not sure I get your meaning.
M	LARRY	It's obvious. She won't sleep with you. It's written all over your puppy dog face.
M	CONOR	It's killing me. Literally. I'm dying.
M	LARRY	Here, have a cookie.
M	CONOR	I just - I have no idea what she's doing. I cannot read her signals - at all. We used to sleep together - all the time. Well, that's not true, I don't know why I said that, it wasn't all the time. But it did happen - I know I'm not making this up. And then, out of nowhere, it stops. But she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages - but it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is she doing?
M	LARRY	Honestly - we may not have the best insight. Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
M	SKIP	He's right. Like - here's "I want to sleep with you". One, two, three - that's it. Three seconds or more - it's on.
M	SKIP	Here's "I don't want to sleep with you."
M	LARRY	One, two - No. Thanks for playing. Move along.
M	SKIP	It's that simple.
M	CONOR	You're right. That's no help at all.
M	LARRY	But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive. She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something. So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer.
M	SKIP	That sounds like felonious advice.
M	LARRY	You're right. Let me rephrase. Don't take maybe for an answer.
M	BEN	Wait. Stop.
F	ANNA	What?
M	BEN	Shit. This is bad.
F	ANNA	What?
M	BEN	I am so into you. I'm lying here watching you and I seriously have never felt this way before. I have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you. I mean, all the time.
F	ANNA	Why stop?
M	BEN	Because I don't do stuff like this.
F	ANNA	Stuff like what?
M	BEN	Like having sex with women who are not my wife.
F	ANNA	First of all, I'm not women. I'm just one. He waits.
M	BEN	What's second of all?
F	ANNA	I didn't have a second of all.
M	BEN	I thought second of all was going to make me feel better.
F	ANNA	Second of all - I can't stop thinking about you, either.
M	BEN	I have to tell her. What?
M	BEN	I have to tell her.
F	ANNA	I don't want to push you to --
M	BEN	I want to be with you. And I can't do that if I'm lying to her.
F	ANNA	You know what's best.
M	LOUIS	Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island. But if she wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy. And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name. Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's. Think to the future. We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last. Because I guarantee you - he won't. And that's the best fatherly advice I can give.
F	ANNA	I'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but I've never felt anything like this before.
F	MARY	This is crazy. I can't believe he's gonna leave his wife for you.
F	ANNA	No, he's not leaving his wife for me. He's just - he's a good guy. And he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her. He's kind of leaving his wife for me. Is this crazy? This is totally crazy. We barely know each other.
F	MARY	I don't know. Remember Becca, my sister's friend. Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one.
F	ANNA	You're totally right. It can happen.
F	MARY	Not for me.
F	ANNA	Well, what about texter? Texter has yet to make any verbal contact. I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice.
F	ANNA	I doubt he has a stoma -
F	MARY	That's not the point. The point is - I can't text. I'm not charming via text. My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard -- So don't text.
F	MARY	It's not just texting. It's email and voicemail and snail mail - That's just mail -
F	MARY	Whatever. None of it's working. I've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand. I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't. That's it. Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting.
F	ANNA	So what about the singer guy?
F	MARY	Jude. Yeah, I like him.
F	ANNA	That's great.
F	MARY	Totally. I felt like we connected.
F	GIGI	Hello.
M	ALEX	Oh, hey. You're home.
F	GIGI	Where am I supposed to be? Out. It's Saturday night.
F	GIGI	You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.
M	ALEX	I was just calling to let you know - I'm having a party at my place next weekend. You should come.
F	GIGI	I don't know. Won't Conor be there? Might be kinda awkward.
M	ALEX	He's in DC for the weekend at some real estate conference. But there's gonna be a bunch of single guys.
F	GIGI	So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward. Thank god.
M	ALEX	Don't worry. I'll be there. I'll talk you through it.
F	GIGI	So, the party - is it like a big party, more of a mellow hang or --
M	ALEX	Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses.
M	WATTS	Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips.
M	KEITH	I think I can handle it.
M	WATTS	It's cool. I was just gonna work on it with you but - if you're comfortable...great.
M	KEITH	Wait. How do you work on it?
M	WATTS	Pretend I'm a girl, OK? I mean, pretend I'm her...Amanda.
F	GIGI	He's into me.
F	JANINE	Awesome. I knew it. Who's this now?
F	GIGI	Alex. It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.
F	JANINE	What?
F	GIGI	From Some Kind of Wonderful.
F	JANINE	Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts?
F	GIGI	Yes.
F	JANINE	So, why aren't you Watts?
F	GIGI	I'm Eric Stoltz.
F	JANINE	What?
F	GIGI	Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz herself.
F	JANINE	Wait - so who's Amanda Jones?
F	GIGI	I guess Conor at first. Now men in general. But that's not the point. The point is -- he's into me.
F	JANINE	You know, I knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you.
F	GIGI	I know! It's so obvious now -- there are so many signs.
F	JANINE	Oooh, gimme the signs. I love to hear about the signs.
F	GIGI	At first they were small - like when I first called he said "Good to hear from you" -
F	JANINE	Totally good sign.
F	GIGI	Right? And then the next time I called he was with a woman - but he still took the call. And talked to me for a while.
F	JANINE	You know it was a woman?
F	GIGI	He called her "babe."
F	JANINE	A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there's something going on.
F	GIGI	I know! And it gets more obvious. I mean, please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with. The fix up was him.
F	JANINE	Wait - really?
F	GIGI	He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us basically have a date. And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place.
F	JANINE	You're right. He so likes you. Let's look up places for your destination wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - I've always wanted to go there.
F	MARY	There's no way he's already called - we only met for coffee last night. I mean we video iChatted. While holding coffee. Kinda like having coffee.
M	NATHAN	Just call your voice mail.
F	MARY	And he told me he had a gig last night, so he probably got in real late. Did I tell you he was singer?
M	BRUCE	Just call.
M	JOSHUA	On speaker.
M	YOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.)	Maaaary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Maaaary. Oh my Maaary.
M	NATHAN	I just got hard. The other guys shush him. Hey Mary, it's Jude. Just wanted to tell you again how special it was to meet you. So, call me back. Bye.
M	BRUCE	Amazing. He'll sing to your babies. Jeeeeny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jeeeeny.
M	YOUR SOUL-UTION (CONT'D)	Hey Jenny, it's Jude. Just wanted to -- oh shit, - what number did I call?
F	JANINE	That one.
M	BEN	No. That's the laminate.
F	JANINE	That one isn't real hardwood floor?
M	BEN	No. But it looks exactly the same - at like one one hundredth of the cost.
F	JANINE	I still wanna go with the real wood.
M	BEN	But you can't even tell the difference.
F	JANINE	That's not the point.
M	BEN	Then what's the point?
F	JANINE	I just don't like the way it's pretending to be wood. If you're not wood, then don't try to look like wood.
M	BEN	I don't think it's pretending --
F	JANINE	It's a lie. Just be up front - tell people what you really are.
M	BEN	You're right. I'm sorry. You're totally right.
F	JANINE	It's OK. Maybe we should look at the grills and come back.
M	BEN	I slept with someone. I heard you. You tell me this in Home Depot because you know how I hate a public scene.
M	BEN	That is not why I -
F	JANINE	I knew it. I KNEW IT. You asshole.
M	BEN	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
F	JANINE	And it's you that's been smoking, too, isn't it?
M	BEN	What? Why does that matter?
M	BEN	No. No. I haven't.
M	BEN (CONT'D)	Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I could stay on his boat for a while if -- EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out? You're like - what - leaving me?
M	BEN	No. NO. I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to --
F	JANINE	We're not going to deal with this? We're not going to figure out a way to work through this?
M	BEN	I just assumed that once I told you, you would want me -- out.
F	JANINE	Is that what you want?
M	BEN	No. JANINE
M	DAN	You must be Beth. Yep.
M	DAN	I've heard a lot about you from Paige. I'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister.
F	BETH	Oh, yeah? So you are - Dan.
M	DAN	Uh, sort of.
F	BETH	Hmmm?
M	DAN	Well, I'm actually a wiccan. So I have a magickal name.
F	BETH	Really?
M	DAN	It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse. But I didn't know if that would fit on a card. It makes your breath stink.
F	GIGI	Pardon?
M	NATHAN	Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff. He said my breath smelled like trout.
F	GIGI	Thanks for the tip.
M	NATHAN	I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy I made out with was a total asshole.
M	BRUCE	You want me to smell you? I'm sure you don't smell like trout.
F	GIGI	Thanks. I'm good.
M	NATHAN	I'm Nathan. This is Bruce.
F	GIGI	Gigi. How do you guys know Alex?
M	BRUCE	We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor.
M	NATHAN	How do you know Alex?
F	GIGI	I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure - something is about to happen between us.
M	NATHAN	So, you're here as like a guest, or like his date? I hate that - when you don't know if you're a date - so you don't know if you should bring a friend, or if you're like co-hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time --
F	GIGI	He didn't really say. But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest. I mean - there have been signs.
M	NATHAN	Cool.
M	BRUCE	I did get a slight waft of trout, though. Take a mint.
F	GIGI	Thank you.
M	DOMINIC	So, where's Neil?
F	BETH	We actually broke up.
M	DOMINIC	No way. You guys were together for like ten years.
F	BETH	Seven. But yes, a long time.
M	DOMINIC	Too bad cousins can't marry, huh? Cuz then we could maybe --
F	BETH	Eeew Dominic, gross.
M	ALEX	I had no idea it would be such a madhouse.
F	GIGI	Hey. Great party. Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need me to evaluate their level of interest?
F	GIGI	They were gay. Even I know that their level of interest was probably low.
M	ALEX	Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it. I still think you guys would hit it off.
F	GIGI	Oh OK. Right. "Bill". Alex doesn't know how to take that.
M	ALEX	Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some more liquor. But it looks like the food could use some refreshing --
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Would you mind helping? I mean, just refill the chips and stuff?
F	GIGI	You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting?
M	ALEX	Uhh, OK. The chips are on top of the fridge.
M	PARTY-GOER #1	Really great party.
F	GIGI	Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have a party, I was like "Let's do it."
M	PARTY-GOER #2	Thanks so much for having us.
F	GIGI	No problem. Anytime.
M	GIGI (CONT'D)	Can I help you find something?
M	TALL GIRL	No, that's OK. I got it.
M	TALL GIRL (CONT'D)	Thanks for mixing that up.
F	GIGI	What?
M	TALL GIRL	Alex asked me to get the dip together. Thanks for getting it started.
M	TALL GIRL (CONT'D)	Hmmm - could use a little more dill.
F	GIGI	When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party.
M	ALEX	I guess people had fun.
M	TALL GIRL	Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?
F	GIGI	That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd stick around, so I'll take care of it.
M	TALL GIRL	No. I got it.
M	ALEX	Knock yourselves out.
F	GIGI	I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles. So, umm - what game is this? Well, maybe I should just -- you know -- I mean it's past three and --
M	TALL GIRL	YES!! Suck it!
M	ALEX	You are sensational.
M	TALL GIRL	Did you say it's past three? Man, I gotta go.
M	ALEX	Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really gotta get to bed.
F	GIGI	Is that an invitation?
M	ALEX	What?
F	GIGI	I'm sorry. That was cheesy. I'm not good at this. Yes! I knew it. I knew it. The best relationships grow out of friendships.
M	ALEX	Wait - what?
F	GIGI	Ummmm....
M	ALEX	Now you and I are in a relationship?
F	GIGI	Well, I'd say if we're not at relationship station--ship, we're at least on the track.
M	ALEX	And why would you think that, exactly?
F	GIGI	Because there were - you know - signs.
M	ALEX	Really? Like what?
F	GIGI	Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You talked to me even when you were with a girl. I felt something...
M	ALEX	What are you talking about? What have I been saying since I met you? If a guy wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. No.
M	ALEX	Why would you do this?
F	GIGI	I thought you were Watts.
M	ALEX	Why do women do this? Why do they build this stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else --
F	GIGI	I'd rather be like that - than like you.
M	ALEX	Excuse me?
F	GIGI	Maybe I dissect each little thing, and put myself out there too much, and maybe I even thrive on the drama of it all-- but at least that means I still care. You think you've won because women are expendable to you? Sure, you don't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way, but you don't fall in love that way, either. You haven't won, Alex. You're alone. I may do a lot of stupid shit - but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.
F	GIGI	Hey Janine, I'm sorry it's so late, but I just - don't start picking out your bridesmaid dress, OK? I know this isn't the first time this has happened, it's just - this one wasn't about whether he liked me. I just really liked him.
F	BETH	You want anything else?
M	KEN	Yeah. Less of that cardboardy brown stuff. More regular people food.
F	BETH	The cardboardy brown stuff is called whole grain bread.
M	KEN	Maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage links?
F	BETH	People who have just had heart attacks generally are not advised to eat animal fat, stuffed in synthetic casings.
M	KEN	Did I tell you that you're not only my favorite daughter, but you're also the prettiest? So much better looking than those other dogs. Seriously.
F	BETH	It's not gonna work this time. But I appreciate the effort.
M	STEVEN	Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer if you're going that way? And a little plate of cold cuts if there are any left?
F	BETH	You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge. My mom is finally taking a nap.
M	DEVON	You think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl? My collection could use a bunch of these.
F	BETH	Turn it the fuck down.
F	BETH	I finally got mom to lay down in the spare room. All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store. Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead. And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel.
M	BETH (CONT'D)	It's OK. It's all gonna be OK.
F	CATHERINE	What am I gonna do without dad?
F	BETH	First of all, he's upstairs watching 'Oprah After The Show'.
F	LAURA	And second of all - you have us.
F	CATHERINE	But he's always been - the one who's there for me.
F	BETH	What about your husband? Where the hell is he?
F	CATHERINE	Playing ultimate frisbee. His team may make the quarterfinals.
F	GIGI	Do you know who it is?
F	JANINE	It doesn't matter.
F	GIGI	So are you going to - leave - him?
F	JANINE	Gigi, he's my husband. He's not just some guy that didn't call me back. And he did admit it to me. He didn't wait to get caught. That takes courage.
M	JANINE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I know Alex was not just some guy.
F	GIGI	It's OK.
F	JANINE	It's my fault, you know.
F	GIGI	What?
F	JANINE	I'm willing to accept my responsibility in this. I forced him into getting married. He wasn't ready.
F	GIGI	Janine - this is not your fault.
F	JANINE	It is. I've - changed. I used to be fun. I was fun when we met.
F	GIGI	You're still fun.
F	JANINE	We never have sex anymore.
F	GIGI	Lots of couples got through lulls.
F	JANINE	No. We never have sex. Realistically, what did I expect him to do?
F	GIGI	I don't think that's really --
F	JANINE	This is too small. I gotta tell Javier.
F	GIGI	What?
F	JANINE	This tile. I gotta go. Tell Beth I took a personal day.
M	MARIEL	My first husband was unimpressive. I found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him. My second husband was a pinch more creative. Cheated on me with my sister - but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious. At last - some intrigue, some mind games - though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up. But my last husband -- he was a gem. A veritable master at covering his tracks. I poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence. It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress. But the real master, I have to say -- is me. Three husbands -- countless boyfriends, and I haven't been caught yet.
F	ANNA	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...
M	BEN	It was all you, babe.
F	ANNA	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
M	BEN	This is really good news.
F	ANNA	I cannot believe this. He liked my demo. Did you hear what he said? When he said it was hauntingly beautiful? Did you hear that part?
M	BEN	Yep. I was sitting right there.
F	ANNA	Thank you. Thank you so much.
M	BEN	How is it that every time I see your body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?
M	BEN (CONT'D)	Dana, I need to go over the offering statement. Can I get a few minutes? It's not Dana.
F	ANNA	Is -
M	BEN	Shit. I told Dana to get this lock fixed. One sec.
F	JANINE	Why do you even lock it?
M	BEN	I'd never get anything done if I didn't.
F	JANINE	Can I come in?
M	BEN	Of course. What are you doing?
F	JANINE	Sit down. Janine, what are you doing?
F	JANINE	I don't know. I just thought - maybe we could, you know, relight the fire.
M	BEN	Honey, did you hear what I just said? I gotta get this offering statement out.
F	JANINE	Look, I am trying here. Do you want to save our marriage or don't you?
M	BEN (O.S.)	Of course I do. Then you'll let me do this. Yeah, just like that, yeah...
M	ALEX	OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in with the servers when you -
M	TYRONE	No...I'm on 8 thru 10. I'm always on 8 through 10. Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10.
M	ALEX	Right. Luis you take 4 through 6.
M	TYRONE	Dude. Luis quit like 10 months ago. Do we even need to have this meeting? Seriously? Does this serve any purpose? Good. Great. Get to work.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me?
M	KELLI ANN	Since you asked me 11 minutes ago? No, not a lot of phone traffic.
M	KELLI ANN (CONT'D)	Oh my god.
M	ALEX	What? It's happened to you. What has happened to me? What's her name?
M	ALEX	Who?
M	KELLI ANN	The girl, Alex.
M	ALEX	There's no girl.
M	KELLI ANN	You can't hide it man. I know strung out and you are strung - out.
M	ALEX	Please -
M	KELLI ANN	This is amazing. Can't focus, right? Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your email 100 times a day. Wishing you could write songs. Feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations... It's always the same. And it has happened to you, my friend. Trust me.
M	ALEX	Shit.
M	KELLI ANN	Welcome to my world asshole.
F	JANINE	You sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli? I'm treating.
M	BEN	I really gotta get this stuff done.
F	JANINE	OK. I'll see you at home. I love you.
M	BEN	I love you too.
M	BEN (CONT'D)	I had no choice. What was I supposed to do when she -
F	ANNA	You make me sick to my stomach. You are a disgusting excuse for a man -
M	BEN	I didn't want to do it, Anna. You know that it's you I want to be with -
F	ANNA	Are you kidding me? You will never lay a hand on me again. I may just be a piss poor girl from Dundalk who works at a gym - but I am so too good for you.
F	GIGI	Dino, thank you again for letting me pay over the phone. I assure you this late payment thing will never happen again. Yep -- just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life. That's my other line. OK. B-bye. Hello?
M	MANS' VOICE	Hi, Gigi. This is Bill.
F	GIGI	Ummm - Alex's friend. We were supposed to meet up - but Alex told me the wrong day.
F	GIGI	Bill. So you do exist.
M	BILL	I do. And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're game.
F	GIGI	Yes. Sure. Why not?
F	ANNA	I'm gonna go. I left the check on the counter. It should at least get you through this month.
M	MAYA	Thanks sweetie. I don't know what I would do without you. Baby - what's the matter? Is it money? Because you can take back the check if - No, it's not that. I mean - yes, I'm broke - but it's not that. It's just - I'm just so lost mom. I've been seeing this guy - who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable. I thought he was - the one - but he turned out to be such an asshole. And then there's - Conor -
F	ANNA	Yeah. Who I'm so horrible to. But he takes it. And he's - there. Waiting. But I just don't want to - I don't know -
M	MAYA	Settle? Like you think I did?
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	Well, your father and I had a glorious life together.
F	ANNA	Are you kidding? All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had.
M	MAYA	Those are just dreams Anna. Now true - I did not like your father at all when we met. Or after we got married for that matter. But let me tell you this - life with him was a hell of a lot better than life is without him.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	There are worse things in life than settling.
F	ANNA	Like what?
M	MAYA	Like wishing you had.
F	ANNA	Hey, sweetie.
M	CONOR	See, why did you call me sweetie?
F	ANNA	Because we always call each other that.
M	CONOR	Why? Anna doesn't have an answer for that. I want to say something, OK? I mean, we call each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery and everything - it's like we're together.
F	ANNA	I know that I -
M	CONOR	Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I haven't been clear about what I want. So let me be clear. I love hanging out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both. I want to make love to you. I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it's true. And I'm not sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don't really care. I just --
M	CONOR	What? ANNA
M	CONOR	I'm talking about really doing this. Like a full-on relationship.
F	ANNA	Right.
M	CONOR	With me.
F	ANNA	Yes.
M	CONOR	Did a bunch of gay people put you up to this?
F	ANNA	Please stop talking.
M	DEVON	Shit! Take him out. He's done.
M	GEORGE	Jesus. This isn't some exhibition game.
M	STEVEN	Could you --
F	BETH	Did anyone have time to run to the store?
M	GEORGE	Nah, we're good. We just got drive through.
F	BETH	I didn't mean for you.
M	NEIL	The dishes are all put away. There's a load of laundry still drying, but the other one is folded on top of the washer. I remembered what your dad likes, but I tried to get healthy stuff, too. Ben told me. I just - I wanted to help. I know how much you love him. But it's gonna be OK. Javier - does this mean what I think it means? So when you say "done" - you don't mean "we still need plumbing in the upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done done"?...Wow - you're amazing...OK...I'll call when I see it...Bye.
M	NEIL	Hey.
F	BETH	It's been a while since I've been here. Turns out - that boat in the next mooring, looks like yours -- not yours.
M	NEIL	Oh no.
F	BETH	No, it's no problem. Nice guy. Invited me in for a white wine spritzer. Not sure he gets a lot of visitors. Can I come in? I wanted to thank you. For coming by my folks' house.
M	NEIL	Of course. I really care about your dad. And I really love you. Even if I can't give you what you want.
F	BETH	You're what I want. Our life together is what I want. Your love is what I want. Did you see those guys my sisters are married to? You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be. And that's enough for me.
M	NEIL	And you'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table? If you promise to love me and be committed to me -
M	NEIL	I always have -
F	BETH	Wait, I'm not done. And snake the shower drain when my hair clogs it, and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed. I do. So, I get to move back in?
F	BETH	I guess. But, you cannot bring those.
M	NEIL	What? You're just mad at me, and you're taking it out on the pants.
F	BETH	Look, I gotta win something. I let you win the big battle, so throw me a bone.
M	NEIL	OK. We're not getting married, but I'm chucking the pants.
F	BETH	Great. We both win.
M	ALEX	Hey, Gigi. It's Alex. I was just wondering how you were doing. It's been a little while since we've talked -- and I was wondering how you were doing.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you. Obviously. But you're out. So, call me. Sometime. Or tonight. I'm around. OK. That's enough now. It's Alex.
M	TYRONE	Dude.
M	ALEX	I know. I know.
F	ANNA	You seriously get a ton of people bidding on this?
M	CONOR	I know it's crazy. But it's a neighborhood "in transition."
F	ANNA	So that means what - that hip gay people want to live out here?
M	CONOR	Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples, young families.
F	ANNA	Weird - it totally reminds me of the house I grew up in. I bet there is a - We totally had this same thing. My mom would use this as her 'desk'. Isn't that bizarre? It was always covered with her little coupons and stuff.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	So, when do all the fabulous homosexual couples start arriving?
M	CONOR	Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I have this one buyer. I mean, I want to see if his girlfriend likes it first -
F	ANNA	His girlfriend?
M	CONOR	I mean, I had this idea -
F	ANNA	An idea for the open house?
M	CONOR	No, an idea. For this house. For - me. To buy. And hopefully, if you like it and things continue to - you know...
M	CONOR (CONT'D)	Anna, look. I have a plan. I know where my life is going. And I want you to go with me. I mean - I'm not saying you have to move in now or anything - I just - I don't want to buy a place that you couldn't - at some point - see yourself moving into. So what do you think? I mean gut reaction. I always go with my gut when it comes to real estate or ---
F	ANNA	I can't do this Conor.
M	CONOR	OK. If it's too fast -
F	ANNA	No. I mean this. Any of this. What you're saying - what you're offering - is what every girl wants. It's what I've always wanted. It's just -
M	CONOR	You don't want it with me.
M	CONOR (CONT'D)	So, I have a question.
F	ANNA	Okay. Is it too late to dial it back to before - Because I thought that really - you know - gelled.
F	GIGI	So, Alex told me you work in finance.
M	BILL	Yes. Yes, I do. Finance.
F	GIGI	This is nice.
M	BILL	It is.
F	GIGI	A nice evening. And you planned it. And called me when you said you would. And showed up on time. Thank you, Bill.
M	BILL	You're very welcome. Hey it's Gigi. You've reached my cell. I'm either having a very good time or in a meeting - either way just leave a message and -- It was nice meeting you.
M	BILL	Thank you for a lovely evening.
F	GIGI	You, too. Goodnight.
F	GIGI	Did you forget something?
M	ALEX	Yeah. I did.
F	GIGI	Really? What did you forget?
M	ALEX	This.
M	NEIL	How did all this stuff fit in here fine before?
F	BETH	I don't know. It expanded. No you are not trying to bring these back in here -
M	NEIL	What? I have no idea what you're -
F	BETH	We had a deal. These are not staying.
M	NEIL	That's really gonna free up a lot of space.
F	BETH	They're going. I have a bag I'm taking to the Goodwill.
M	NEIL	Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make sure there's nothing in the pockets before we give them away.
M	NEIL (CONT'D)	I love you so much. So much. I want to make you happy. I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy, too.
M	NEIL (CONT'D)	Will you marry me?
F	BETH	Yes. Of course, yes.
F	GIGI	You came all the way here - at 11 at night - to give me back a promotional pen?
M	ALEX	I thought I better come up with some excuse to get over here. Isn't that how it's done?
F	GIGI	Sometimes.
M	ALEX	Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I drive by your place. I call and hang up. I'm turning into -
F	GIGI	Me.
M	ALEX	Yeah.
F	GIGI	Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen. No matter what.
M	ALEX	True.
F	GIGI	Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to "make it happen."
M	ALEX	Here's the thing about that. You were right. I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women, having the power - that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually - fell - for one of them.
F	GIGI	Look, I've just been out with your friend Bill. And it just might be exactly what I need. No drama. He calls. He does what he says.
M	ALEX	I could do that stuff too.
F	GIGI	But you didn't. And that same wise person told me that I am the rule. That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change - stop thinking that I will be the --
M	GIGI (CONT'D)	- that I will be the exception.
M	ALEX	You are my exception.
M	NATHAN	Jonathan?
M	NATTILY DRESSED GAY	What are you guys doing up there?
M	NATHAN	Dancing. Get your asses up here.
M	NATTILY DRESSED GAY	This is Conor. He just sold us on the most amazing duplex in Mt. Vernon.
F	MARY	Hey, Conor. I'm Mary. It's so great to finally meet you in person. You, too. Would you like to dance?
F	MARY	I'd love to.
M	BEN	Shit... Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up. If a guy punches you, he likes you. Never try to trim your own bangs. And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending. Every movie we see, every story we're told, implores us to wait for it. The third act twist...the man who couldn't get it together finally figuring it out...the unexpected declaration of love... ...the exception to the rule. What we're not taught is how to read the signs. How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't. The one's who'll stay from the one's who'll leave. And ultimately, we're not taught the one thing that could save ourselves, our friends, our families countless hours of confusion, despair, and speculation.
M	NEW GUY	It was nice meeting you. That sometimes the happy ending...is just moving on.
