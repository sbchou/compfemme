M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NARRATOR	In the New York Herald, November 26, year 1911, there is an account of the hanging of three men --
M	Black and White Lumiere Footage	Three men hung....bang...bang...bang.
M	Newspaper Headline	comes into focus; "Three Men Hung."
M	Sub Head	comes into focus; "...for murder of..."
M	NARRATOR	...they died for the murder of Sir Edmund William Godfrey --
M	NARRATOR	-- Husband, Father, Pharmacist and all around gentle-man resident of --
M	NARRATOR	Greenberry Hill, London. Population as listed.
M	NARRATOR	He was murdered by three vagrants whose motive was simple robbery. They were identified as:
M	NARRATOR	...Joseph Green.....
M	NARRATOR	...Stanley Berry....
M	NARRATOR	...and Nigel Hill... "Greenberry Hill Pharmacy."
M	LUMIERE FOOTAGE REPLAYED.	Three men hug. Bang...bang...bang...
M	NARRATOR	Green, Berry and Hill.
M	NARRATOR	...And I Would Like To Think This Was Only A Matter Of Chance.
M	NARRATOR	As reported in the Reno Gazzette, June of 1983 there is the story of a fire --- The trees are on fire....moments later....
M	NARRATOR	--- the water that it took to contain the fire -- dropped from a FIRE DEPARTMENT AIR TANKER.
M	NARRATOR	-- and a scuba diver named Delmer Darion. CAMERA dollies in and TILTS up towards the top of the tree to reveal:
M	FIRE FIGHTER (OC)	What the fuck is that?
M	ANGLE, CU. DELMER DARION.	He still has his mask and mouthpiece.
M	NARRATOR	Employee of the Peppermill Hotel and Casino, Reno, Nevada. Engaged as a blackjack dealer --
M	NARRATOR	-- well liked and well regarded as a physical, recreational and sporting sort -- Delmer's true passion was for the lake --
M	NARRATOR	-- as reported by the coroner, Delmer died of a heart attack somewhere between the lake and the tree. But most curious side note is the suicide the next day of Craig Hansen --
M	NARRATOR	...volunteer firefighter, estranged father of four and a poor tendency to drink -- Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the plane that quite accidentally lifted Delmer Darion out of the water --
M	NARRATOR	-- added to this, Mr. Hansen's tortured life met before with Delmer Darion just two nights previous -- mumbling to himself:
M	CRAIG HANSEN	...oh God...fuck...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
M	NARRATOR	The weight of the guilt and the measure of coincidence so large, Craig Hansen took his life.
M	CRAIG HANSEN	...forgive me...
M	NARRATOR	And I Am Trying To Think This Was All Only A Matter Of Chance. CAMERA pushes in quick then blends to 60fps on a man in glasses:
M	NARRATOR	The tale told at a 1961 awards dinner for the American Association Of Forensic Science by Dr. Donald Harper, president of the association, began with a simple suicide attempt --
M	NARRATOR	Seventeen year old Sydney Barringer. In the city of Los Angeles on March 23, 1958.
M	NARRATOR	The coroner ruled that the unsuccessful suicide had suddenly become a succesful homicide. To explain:
M	NARRATOR	The suicide was confirmed by a note, left in the breast pocket of Sydney Barringer --
M	NARRATOR	At the same time young Sydney stood on the ledge of this nine story building, an argument swelled three stories below --
M	NARRATOR	The neighbors heard, as they usually did, the arguing of the tenants --
M	NARRATOR	-- and it was not uncommon for them to threaten each other with a shotgun or one of the many handguns kept in the house --
M	OLDER MAN	Put it down, put that fuckin' thing down Fay --
M	OLDER WOMAN	-- I'II fucking tell YOU. I'll shoot you in the face and end this argument and we see who's right --
M	NARRATOR	And when the shotgun accidentaly went off, Sydney just happend to pass --
M	OLDER MAN	You CRAZY FUCKIN' BITCH WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
M	OLDER WOMAN	SHUT THE FUCK UP.
M	NARRATOR	Added to this, the two tenants turned out to be: Fay and Arthur Barringer. Sydney's mother and Sydney's father.
M	NARRATOR	When confronted with the charge, which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime, Fay Barringer swore that she did not know that the gun was loaded.
M	FAY BARRINGER	I didn't know -- I didn't know --
M	ARTHUR BARRINGER	She always threatens me with the gun, but I don't keep it loaded --
M	DETECTIVE	-- and you didn't load the gun?
M	ARTHUR BARRINGER	Why would I load the gun?
M	NARRATOR	A young boy who lived in the building, sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney Barringer said that he had seen, six days prior the loading of the shotgun --
M	DETECTIVE	C'mere a minute --
M	NARRATOR	It seems that the arguing and the fighting and all of the violence was far too much for Sydney Barringer and knowing his mother and father's tendency to fight, he decided to do something --
M	YOUNG BOY	He said he wanted them to kill each other, that all they wanted to do was kill each other and he would help them if that's what they wanted to do --
M	NARRATOR	Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop --
M	NARRATOR	Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth floor window --
M	NARRATOR	He is killed instantly but continues to fall -- only to find, three stories below -- a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach.
M	NARRATOR	So Fay Barringer was charged with the murder of her son and Sydney Barringer noted as an accomplice in his own death...
M	NARRATOR	...and it is in the humble opinion of this narrator that this is not just "Something That Happened." This cannot be "One of those things..." This, please, cannot be that. And for what I would like to say, I can't. This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance.
M	NARRATOR	Ohhhh. These strange things happen all the time.

F	MARCIE	No. I said that.
M	JIM KURRING	Are you lyin' to me?
F	MARCIE	I live alone.
M	JIM KURRING	Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
F	MARCIE	No I Said.
M	JIM KURRING	Ok. What's your name?
F	MARCIE	Marcie.
M	JIM KURRING	Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
F	MARCIE	I preffer to stand.
M	JIM KURRING	I'm not askin', Marcie.
F	MARCIE	I didn't do anything.
M	JIM KURRING	Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
F	MARCIE	I don't know a loud crash.
M	JIM KURRING	And what about screaming?
F	MARCIE	I said: I DON'T KNOW. You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
M	JIM KURRING	What's this, how did this happen? An ashtray has fallen on the floor, cigarette butts all around.
F	MARCIE	An ashtray fell, I don't know, maybe last night, I just woke up.
M	JIM KURRING	You just woke up. And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
F	MARCIE	I went out last night.
M	JIM KURRING	Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me. The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
F	MARCIE	It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
M	JIM KURRING	Yes I can, Marcie. And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
F	MARCIE	Mischief? What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
M	JIM KURRING	Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok? Mischief. Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
F	MARCIE	No.
M	JIM KURRING	You on any medication?
F	MARCIE	No.
M	JIM KURRING	Been drinkin' today?
F	MARCIE	It's ten o'clock in the morning --
M	JIM KURRING	--- What was that?

M	EARL	...n'I dowanna do this...sit here, I can see the things, y'know...it's gettin' there that's the cocksucker...like...I see that pen...I see it, I know it's there, I reach out for it -- no --

M	PHIL	You do?
M	EARL	...ah...
M	PHIL	Where is he?
M	EARL	I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
M	PHIL	No.
M	EARL	Get a girlfriend.
M	PHIL	I'm trying.
M	EARL	And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
M	PHIL	She went out. She said she went out to run some errands. She'll be back.
M	EARL	She's a good girl. She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
M	PHIL	She loves you.
M	EARL	...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
M	PHIL	When was the last time you talked to your son?
M	EARL	....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
M	PHIL	-- memory?
M	EARL	Time lines, y'know? I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
M	PHIL	Yeah.
M	EARL	"yeah." the fuck do you know?
M	PHIL	I've seen it before.
M	EARL	Other fuckin' assholes like me.
M	PHIL	There's no asshole like you.
M	EARL	...cocksucker....
M	PHIL	How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
M	EARL	Do me a personal favor --
M	PHIL	Go fuck myself?
M	EARL	You got it.
M	EARL	...I can't hold onto this anymore...
M	PHIL	I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
M	EARL	...gimme that fuckin' phone...
M	PHIL	Who are you gonna call?
M	EARL	I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
M	PHIL	Who?
M	EARL	Jack.
M	PHIL	Is Jack your son?
M	PHIL	You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
M	EARL	-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
M	EARL	This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
M	PHIL	It's ok.
M	EARL	...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
M	PHIL	Frank Mackey. That's your son?
M	EARL	that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
M	EARL	ifyougimmethat....overonthe....fuck.... I can't hold ontothis anymore...
F	FRANK	Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.
F	FRANK	And you did hear me right. Tame it. Take it on, head first -- with your skills at work and say, "No. You will not control me. You will not take my soul and you will not win this game." 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge. I'm the one who says yes, no, now or here. Shit, man. Sad but true. Sad But True. And you wanna know what? It must be the way. The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going through today is how universal the whole thing is. I mean: I wish I could sit here and say that it's not -- because the reality? If each chick had something new, something really new that I'd never seen before? Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money! Because I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case. They are universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same. Each and every one of them. And once you learn these methods: You're Set. You Don't Have To Come Back. That's it. In solid. Boom. Done. Over. Why? Because all women are the same. Period. End of discussion. Sorry. It's true. Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are "unfair?" Yes, they are. Guilty as charged. And so's the world. It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie --
M	CAPTAIN MUFFY	You're Gwenovier?
M	GWENOVIER	Yeah.
M	CAPTIAN MUFFY	I'm Captain Muffy, I'm Frank's personal assistant. This is Doc --
M	DOC	Hello.
M	GWENOVIER	Hello.
M	CAPTAIN MUFFY	We can go right in here. He started about thirty five minutes ago, but it's all getting pumped up now --
F	FRANK	Number One: Get a calendar. I cannot stress this enough. This is a simple item guys. It's 99 cents at your corner store: Go And Get One. Fuck it, if you reach into your packet, you'll see I've been nice enough to include one, 'cause that's the kind of prick I am -- You're gonna need this calendar and I know it sounds like a small thing, but having it makes all the difference in the world: If you meet a girl and you're gonna work an A-3 Interuption -- let's say an eight day waiting period before the next call -- how you gonna know when those eight days are up? Buy a calendar. Next move? Mark the calendar. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What did I pay my eight hundred dollars for? To hear Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it? Just stick with me and stick by the calendar. Mark it up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna make that "friend" something else -- you gotta be hard on yourself, set goals: You, there: And What's Your Name?
M	FEMALE VOICE	Hello?
M	PHIL	Hi. Is Frank there?
M	FEMALE VOICE	I think you have the wrong number.
M	PHIL	I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
M	FEMALE VOICE	No.
M	PHIL	Is this 509-9027?
M	FEMALE VOICE	Yeah. You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
M	PHIL	Alright. Thank you.
M	FEMALE VOICE	Yep.
M	GWENOVIER	Sorry I'm late --
M	CAMERAMAN	-- we're all set upstairs.
M	GWENOVIER	Thanks.
M	DOC	You have everything you need?
M	GWENOVIER	I'm set, thanks.
F	FRANK	Denise?
M	GUY	That's right --
F	FRANK	-- and she hurt you didn't she? I know, I know. I know how that can be brother, but let me tell you loud and clear what we will be teaching Denise when we put our calendars to work and set goals:
F	FRANK	Little Denise, I say this: I mark it up and I write it down and you've been warned: "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay." "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage." I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. And what? I've said "enough is enough." Because why? She's not gonna be your pal. She's not gonna be your friend. You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something? Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise! But: Listen up: That is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting Jealousy Traps. But we'll get to that. Number One (this is page 18 in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and
F	FRANK	Create a crisis -- simple and clean, and if done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush. Here we go: Set a date with your so-called "friend." Let's say you make it 7:30. You call her on the phone --
M	GIRL	That sounds like fun, Frank. I love seafood.
F	FRANK	So I'll see you about 7:30? Great, then. Bye-bye, Cindy.
M	FRANK (VO)	You wait until about nine o'clock and you ring the doorbell.
M	FRANK (VO)	She opens it up, pissed as hell, but finds you sobbing your eyes out --
F	FRANK	...I can't believe what happened...
M	FRANK (VO)	You explain between sobs that you hit a dog on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal hospital but by the time you got there --
F	FRANK	...and it's paw was sticking out... and it was too late. It was too late.
M	GIRL	Ohhh, shhhh...shhh...Frank...
F	FRANK	I can't believe I'm telling you guys this, but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS. Any girl that calls herself your friend is not gonna let you be alone in a situation like that. Technique #2: Staging a fight. This is not knock down, drag out, crying screaming, yelling -- this is a simple, direct and subtle way of planting confusion into a girl's mind. Remember we are using reinforcement technique "G" with these women. Here's how:
M	FRANK (VO)	One day, she calls you up on the phone...
F	FRANK	Hello?
M	GIRL	Hey, Frank. It's Cindy. I'm wondering if you wanna grab a bite and see a movie? You very directly say:
F	FRANK	"I don't think I have anything to say to you, Cindy."
F	FRANK	Let her wonder what she did wrong.
F	FRANK	This is the way...because they will always wonder, "What did I do?" "What could I have done different?" "How should I behave to get this back?" And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and That Is What You Must Do. That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Mrs. Partridge --
F	LINDA	I'm here and I need to see him.
F	LINDA	-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
M	DR. LANDON	I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
F	LINDA	I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me practical things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do? Then What?
M	DR. LANDON	Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you. They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
F	LINDA	He has Phil right now.
M	DR. LANDON	Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
F	LINDA	Yeah.
M	DR. LANDON	If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body -- -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
M	DR. LANDON	We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
F	LINDA	I'm listening. I'm getting better.
M	DR. LANDON	Do you wanna sit down?
F	LINDA	I need to sit down.
M	DR. LANDON	Ok. Linda: Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is. He is dying very, very rapidly --
M	DR. LANDON	Now the thing here is making that experience as painless and easy as possible for him, you understand? Now you need to get in touch with Hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that you're asking me about -- they are who you call when he dies.
M	DR. LANDON	This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
F	LINDA	-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
M	DR. LANDON	The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right? You understand?

M	CAPTAIN MUFFY	Chief, this is Gwenovier from the show, "Profiles," for the interview --
F	FRANK	Hello, hello, I'm a bit out of breath from all this work --
M	GWENOVIER	That's fine. It's nice to meet you.
F	FRANK	Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
M	GWENOVIER	If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
F	FRANK	You got us a room so quick?
F	FRANK	I'm kidding of course.
F	FRANK	I swear to fucking-god, I do one-a-my seminars, I'm Superaman! I'm Batman! I'm like a fucking action hero the way I feel afterwards, like I could walk out this door, down the street, pick up any fuckin' pootie I see that has even one second to stop --
M	GWENOVIER	All it takes is one second?
F	FRANK	Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
M	GWENOVIER	I'm gonna start rolling --
F	FRANK	-- go, go, go. I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey. If anything, there are women out there that want to destroy me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me." So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time. Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey. Can I have a cigarette?
M	GWENOVIER	Ok. So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
F	FRANK	What do you want to know?
F	DONNIE	Make it happen, make it happen and go,go,go.

M	COCKTAIL WAITRESS	-- what kind?
F	DONNIE	It doesn't matter.
F	JULIA	Do you still have to do homework?
F	RICHARD	Not as much as I used to. Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
M	STANLEY	I don't have regular classes anymore.
F	RICHARD	What do you do?
M	STANLEY	They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
F	RICHARD	That's pretty cool.
F	JULIA	Do you have an agent, Stanley?
M	STANLEY	No.
F	JULIA	You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
M	STANLEY	Like what?
F	RICHARD	What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
F	CYNTHIA	-- Richard.
F	RICHARD	Bite it, Cynthia. You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
F	JULIA	Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
M	STANLEY	What's MOW?
F	JULIA	Movie Of The Week. I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
F	RICHARD	Was it a call back?
F	JULIA	No. But I probably will get a call back.
F	RICHARD	If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
F	JULIA	I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
F	RICHARD	Saucy-saucy.
F	CYNTHIA	C'mon guys, settle down --
M	STANLEY	Cynthia?
F	CYNTHIA	What?
M	STANLEY	How much time do we have?
F	CYNTHIA	Not enough, what do you want?
M	STANLEY	I should maybe go to the bathroom.
F	CYNTHIA	Can you hold it?
M	STANLEY	I don't know.
F	CYNTHIA	Just hold it, you'll be fine.
F	JULIA	Here they come -- Puerto Rican guy named LUIS GUZMAN (40s)
M	RICHARD (sotto)	Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep lookin' tough-old folks.
M	STANLEY	They look pretty smart, I think.
F	JULIA	No they don't --
F	RICHARD	What are they gonna do -- beat us?
M	STANLEY	Maybe.
F	JULIA	We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
F	RICHARD	When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
F	JIMMY	You look great.
M	PAULA	What the fuck is this, Jimmy?

M	PAULA	-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon. Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an asshole.
F	JIMMY	I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
F	JIMMY	Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
M	PAULA	All your other fluzzies?
F	JIMMY	Yeah. Yes.
M	PAULA	You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
M	PAULA	Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
F	JIMMY	Yes.
M	PAULA	Will you say my name?
F	JIMMY	If she asks me any question I want to tell her. I want to tell her everything I've done.
M	PAULA	Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
M	PAULA	Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy. I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
F	JIMMY	I won't.

M	JIM KURRING	You mind if I come in, check things?
F	CLAUDIA	For what?
M	JIM KURRING	Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
F	CLAUDIA	I'm sorry.

F	CLAUDIA	Yeah, but I don't know --
M	JIM KURRING	-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
F	CLAUDIA	No.
M	JIM KURRING	Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
F	CLAUDIA	I didn't realize it was that loud.
M	JIM KURRING	And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
F	CLAUDIA	Yeah.
M	JIM KURRING	You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
M	CALUDIA	I don't know -- I mean. What is this?
M	JIM KURRING	Have you been drinkin' today, doin' some drugs?
F	CLAUDIA	No.
M	JIM KURRING	I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music. Has there been some screaming and yelling?
F	CLAUDIA	Yes. I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left. I'm sorry.
M	JIM KURRING	Was it a boyfriend of yours?
F	CLAUDIA	No.
M	JIM KURRING	You don't have a boyfriend?
F	CLAUDIA	No.
M	JIM KURRING	Who was it?
F	CLAUDIA	I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
M	JIM KURRING	You mind if I check things back here?
F	CLAUDIA	It's fine.
F	CLAUDIA	What are you lookin' for?
M	JIM KURRING	Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
F	CLAUDIA	ok.
M	JIM KURRING	You just move in here?
F	CLAUDIA	About two years ago.
M	JIM KURRING	Bit messy.
F	CLAUDIA	Yeah.
M	JIM KURRING	I'm a bit of a slob myself.
F	CLAUDIA	Yeah.
M	JIM KURRING	You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
F	CLAUDIA	I don't have a boyfriend.
F	DONNIE	You look like you've got money in your pocket.
M	THURSTON	Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
F	DONNIE	Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
M	THURSTON	This sounds threatening.
F	DONNIE	Do you have love in your heart?
M	THURSTON	I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend.
F	DONNIE	Is it real love?
M	THURSTON	Well --
F	DONNIE	-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy. Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
M	THURSTON	Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
F	DONNIE	I have love.
M	THURSTON	A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
F	DONNIE	No. I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
M	THURSTON	And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
F	DONNIE	My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
M	YOUNG PHARMACY KID	Hello.
F	LINDA	Hi.
M	YOUNG PHARMACY KID	Wow. Lot-o-stuff here, huh?
M	FLOOR DIRECTOR	Thirty Seconds.
F	RICHARD	The fuck is wrong with you?
M	STANLEY	I gotta go to the bathroom.
F	JULIA	Jesus Christ, Stanley.
M	RICK	-- you cannot do that. You have to tone it. Don't be real agressive, just subtely abusive. You must say, "No. You are not leaving this house until that room is cleaned."
M	JULIA'S MOM	Julia's room is the same way.
M	JULIA'S DAD	Like a pig sty. But it's the outfits that we're getting into now -- You should have seen what she had on walking out the door --
M	JULIA'S DAD	-- all dolled up.
M	JULIA'S MOM	I said: "No. No. No. We are not going to a fashion show. You are going to school."
M	RICHARD'S MOM	-- It's not a fashion show, it's school.
M	JULIA'S MOM	It is not a fashion show.
M	RICK	Let's make some fuckin' money, folks.
M	BURT	You okay? huh? Jimmy?
F	JIMMY	And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
M	BURT	C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
F	JIMMY	In my sleep, Burt.
M	FLOOR DIRECTOR	And...three...two...one....

M	ANGLE, EARL'S TELEVISION	Jimmy behind the podium.
M	JIMMY GATOR	Adults won a coin toss backstage and they'll have first choice: Todd.

M	ANGLE, PHIL	He dumps the bag out and goes straight for the Porno Magazines.
M	PHIL	Got it.
M	JIMMY GATOR	First question for 25. This female author's most famous work "O! Pioneers" -- CAMERA pushes in super-quick as Phil picks up the phone and
M	STANLEY	Willa Cather.
F	JIMMY	For 25. Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright -- Thomas Kyd.
F	JIMMY	This French playwright and actor joined the Bejart troupe of actors -- Moliere.
F	JIMMY	I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
M	STANLEY	Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
M	LUIS (to Todd)	What the fuck is this?
M	RICK	My little fucker -- I have no idea where he gets this stuff. "Seduce and Destroy," thisz Chad, can I have your home phone number with area code, please?
M	PHIL	Hi, hello, great. This is Seduce and Destroy?
M	CHAD	It is. Can I have your home phone number with area code?
M	PHIL	Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
M	CHAD	I'm really only equipped to take orders --
M	PHIL	Well can you connect me to someone else?
M	CHAD	Well what's the situation?
M	PHIL	Well, ok. Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go: I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse. He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello? Are you there, hello?
M	CHAD	I'm here, I'm listening.
M	PHIL	OK. See: Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
M	GWEN	Where are you from originally?
F	FRANK	Around here.
M	GWEN	the valley?
F	FRANK	Hollywood, mainly.
M	GWEN	And what did your parents do?
F	FRANK	My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
M	GWEN	Why does that sound silly?
F	FRANK	Well I guess it doesn't.
M	GWEN	Does you mother still work?
F	FRANK	She's retired.
M	GWEN	Are you close?
F	FRANK	She's my mother.
M	GWEN	What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
F	FRANK	"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
M	GWEN	And your father?
F	FRANK	He passed away.
M	GWEN	I'm sorry.
F	FRANK	people die.
M	GWEN	I wouldn'tve asked --
F	FRANK	Not a problem.
M	GWEN	And you ended up at UC Berkely --
F	FRANK	From '84 to '89.
M	GWEN	Psychology major?
F	FRANK	Right.
M	GWEN	Do you have your masters?
F	FRANK	...this close...
M	GWEN	In five years?
F	FRANK	Muffy, can I get another ciggy?
M	YOUNG PHARMACY KID	Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
F	LINDA	mmmhmm.
M	YOUNG PHARMACY KID	Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh? You could have quite a party all that stuff....
M	YOUNG PHARMACY KID	You been on Prozac long? Dexadrine?
F	LINDA	...I don't....
M	YOUNG PHARAMCY KID	Interesting drugs. Dexadrine's basically speed in a pill. Y'know? But I guess a lot of doctors are balancing out the prozac with the dexadrine, eh? That Liquid Morphine'll knock you down, out, around, up and down someone's not careful.....can't mix those up, y'know... ...Must have a lot goin' on in your life for all that stuff there. Strong, strong stuff here, boy...wow.... What exactly you have wrong, you need this stuff?
F	LINDA	You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
M	YOUNG PHARMACY KID	-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
F	LINDA	I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE INDECENCY TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
M	OLDER PHARMACIST	Please, lady, why don't you just calm down --
F	LINDA	And FUCK YOU TOO. Don't you call me "lady." I come in with these things, I give it over to you, you doubt, you make your phone calls, check on me, look suspicious, ask questions, "I'm sick." I HAVE SICKNESS ALL AROUND ME AND YOU FUCKING ASK ME MY LIFE? WHAT'S WRONG? HAVE YOU SEEN DEATH IN YOUR BED IN YOUR HOUSE? And where is your fucking decency? That I'm asked questions "WHAT'S WRONG?" You suck my dick, that's what's wrong and you, you fucking call me "lady." You SHAME ON YOU. SHAME ON YOU. SHAME ON BOTH OF YOU. CU - Bottle cap of Dexadrine popped off. CU - Linda's mouth as she swallows back the pills.
M	CHAD	Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
M	PHIL	I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
M	CHAD	Uh-huh.
M	PHIL	Does this sound weird?
M	CHAD	Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
M	PHIL	There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know. Dying of Cancer.
M	CHAD	What kind of Cancer?
M	PHIL	Brain and Lung.
M	CHAD	My mother had breast cancer.
M	PHIL	It's rough. I'm sorry, did she make it?
M	CHAD	Oh, she's fine.
M	PHIL	Oh that's good.
M	CHAD	It was scary though.
M	PHIL	It's a helluva disease.
M	CHAD	Sure is. So why call me?
M	PHIL	I know this all seems silly. I know that maybe I sound ridiculous, like maybe this is the scene of the movie where the guy is trying to get ahold of the long-lost son, but this is that scene. Y'know? I think they have those scenes in movies because they're true, because they really happen. And you gotta believe me: This is really happening. I mean, I can give you my phone number and you can call me back if you wanna check with whoever you can check this with, but don't leave me hanging on this -- please -- please. See: See: See this is the scene of the movie where you help me out --
M	GWENOVIER	-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
F	FRANK	Like I said, yeah --
M	GWEN	And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
F	FRANK	I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled. I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what was as opposed to I wanted.
M	GWEN	Where does that name come from?
F	FRANK	What name? My name?
M	GWEN	It's not your given name, right?
F	FRANK	My mother's name, actually. Good question. You've done you're research.
M	GWEN	And "Frank?"
F	FRANK	"Frank" was my mother's father.
M	GWEN	Ok. That's why. I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
F	FRANK	Oh, yeah. No, no, no. They wouldn't --
M	GWEN	They wouldn't?
F	FRANK	no, no, no. Certainly not. I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
M	GWEN	Kind of.
F	FRANK	I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there. But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World. Defining It. Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine. You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not? he.he.he.
M	JIMMY GATOR	End of Round One! Excellent work ladies and germs, let's see the scores on the boards: Kids up a leg with 2025, Adults down a bit with 1200. We'll be back for Round Two and a Ring-Dang-Do --
M	JIMMY GATOR	HELLO! Musical Bonus Question before we go to break and the lucky team is --
M	JIMMY GATOR	Kids in the lead and they get a chance to pull further and farther ahead -- with the following secret bonus musical question: I will read you a line from an opera and you are to give me the same line in the language in which the opera was originaly written and for a bonus 25 you can sing it. Here's the line: "Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame, and it's all in vain to call it, if it chooses to refuse."
M	STANELY	Well that was..uh..in French...and that was in the opera, "Carmen." And that goes...um... L'amour est un oiseau rebelle Que nul ne peut apprivoiser, Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle, S'il lui convient de refuser.
M	JIM KURRING	got some coffee brewing, huh?
F	CLAUDIA	Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
M	JIM KURRING	I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
F	CLAUDIA	-- do you wanna cup?
M	JIM KURRING	That's great, thank you.
F	CLAUDIA	I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
M	JIM KURRING	Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
F	CLAUDIA	You take cream or sugar?
M	JIM KURRING	That'd be fine. So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud: They're incovenienced by that. If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
F	CLAUDIA	Yeah.
M	JIM KURRING	Arlight, then. Cheers.
M	JIM KURRING	Is this boyfriend bothering you?
F	CLAUDIA	I don't have a boyfriend.
M	JIM KURRING	The gentleman who came to the door --
F	CLAUDIA	-- is not my boyfriend.
M	JIM KURRING	Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
F	CLAUDIA	It's not -- what's a 422?
M	JIM KURRING	It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help. Now there are certain measures you can take --
F	CLAUDIA	It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over. Really. It's not. He won't came back.
M	JIM KURRING	I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
F	CLAUDIA	You won't. You won't have to.
M	JIM KURRING	But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
F	CLAUDIA	I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
M	JIM KURRING	Okey-doke.
F	JIMMY	I can't fuckin' do this.
F	MARY	Are you alright?
F	JIMMY	Fuck. I think I'm gonna throw up, I think. I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old. Stanley is trying to flag down Cynthia, who stands off in the
F	CYNTHIA	Stanley, what's the problem?
M	STANLEY	I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
F	CYNTHIA	Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now. You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom. I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
F	RICHARD	Why does this kinda shit always happen, Stanley?
M	LUIS	What's the problem over there?
F	RICHARD	Mind yer bussiness --
M	MIM	Watch your mouth, little man.
F	JULIA	Why don't you mind your own bussiness?
F	CYNTHIA	Alright, stop it, cool down, cool it. Please. Now: Stanley, you wait until the next commercial break and you can go then -- Just Hold It. Don't taunt the kids --
M	LUIS	I just asked what was going on --
F	CYNTHIA	Don't start trouble, Luis. CAMERA pushes in on Jimmy from behind as he throws up in a corner.
M	OC VOICE	Two minutes, everyone, we're back in two!
F	LINDA	I'm Linda Partridge to see Alan Kligman.
F	JANET	"Seduce and Destroy," thisz Janet.
M	CHAD	Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
F	JANET	What's wrong?
M	CHAD	Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
F	JANET	-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
M	EARL	LILY. FUCK. LIL, PLEASE. LILY.
F	JANET	...mmm.hmmm. mmm..hmm. Alright. Put him through and lemme see what's goin' on --
M	CHAD	Phil, you there?
M	PHIL	Yeah, hey. Chad.
M	CHAD	Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
M	PHIL	Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
M	CHAD	Thank you. Thank you very much.
F	JANET	Hello?
M	CHAD	Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
F	JANET	Hello, Phil.
M	PHIL	Hi, hi, thank you for taking my call --
M	JIMMY GATOR	I have Cancer, Mary.
M	JIMMY GATOR	I have about two months, I have no time. It's in my bones and I don't have a chance. And I'm fucked. I had a stroke last week --
F	MARY	...Jimmy...
M	FLOQR DIRECTOR	Ten Seconds.
F	DONNIE	....do you know who I am?
M	THURSTON	You're a friend of the family I presume?
F	DONNIE	What? What does that mean?
M	THURSTON	Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
F	DONNIE	You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
M	THURSTON	Might of been before my time. I remember you. I remember. In the 60's right?
F	DONNIE	I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.
M	THURSTON	...like you said...
M	PATRON #1	Smart Kid! Fuck, yeah, he-he. You got hit by lightning that one time, right?
F	DONNIE	So what?
M	PATRON #1	I heard about that.
M	PATRON #2	Did it hurt?
F	DONNIE	Yes.
M	THURSTON	But you're alright now, so what's the what?
F	DONNIE	What?
M	THURSTON	That's right.
F	DONNIE	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
M	THURSTON	Brad, dear?
M	THURSTON	Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
F	DONNIE	-- Samuel Johnson.
M	BRAD	I don't know.
M	THURSTON	It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
F	DONNIE	"The" cause of dullness in others --
M	THURSTON	Picky, picky.
F	DONNIE	-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money? His parents? His mommy and daddy? Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
M	PATRON #1	You're parents took your money you won on that game show?
F	DONNIE	Yes they did. What does that mean, "spoke in the wheel?"
M	THURSTON	Things go round 'n round, don't they?
F	DONNIE	Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see? I will.
M	THURSTON	This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
F	DONNIE	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
M	THURSTON	Shall we drink to that?
F	DONNIE	"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
M	THURSTON	"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
M	JIMMY GATOR	KIDS! Are you guys glued to those seats or what? Are you ever leaving? You're getting close to the record, do you get more nervous as we go along?
F	RICHARD	A little --
F	JULIA	-- yeah....
M	JIMMY GATOR	-- kids at school must be real excited for you, eh?
F	JULIA	Oh, yeah...yeah...
F	RICHARD	Sure.
M	JIMMY GATOR	Stanley the Man! How are you?
M	STANLEY	I'm fine. Yes.
M	JIMMY GATOR	You're fast becoming a celebrity. How are you handling it all?
M	STANLEY	Ohh, it's all fine. It's all. Nice. I'd just like to keep going....keep getting on....
M	JIMMY GATOR	Sure, sure...that's fine, then...there...with.....
M	JIMMY GATOR	Well you've got..many..things, many things happening and on the way.... CAMERA PUSHES IN on Burt as he sees Jimmy start to zone out a bit.
F	JIMMY	What were you saying, Stanley?
M	STANLEY	I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
F	JIMMY	OK, OK, here we go: Steeper questions, bigger payoff, individual challenges with musical and audio pockets, no-steal-lock-out's, let's get it on in Round Two, Categories are:
F	FRANK	-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this: That there is no need for insight or understanding. Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is? I'm talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values. GOD DAMN I'M GOOD. There is no need for INSIGHT. There is no need for UNDERSTANDING. I have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language. The "listener-patient" light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new. The System's state. What did I do? I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn. I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
M	GWENOVIER	Let's talk about --
F	FRANK	I just realized this is for television, isn't it? I can't swear up and down like I just did.
M	GWENOVIER	It's fine. I can bleep it out.
F	FRANK	I warned you -- I get on a roll...
M	GWENOVIER	-- let's talk more about your background --
F	FRANK	Muffy -- coffee?
M	GWENOVIER	I'm confused about your past is the thing.
F	FRANK	Is that still lingering?
M	GWENOVIER	-- just to clarify --
F	FRANK	So boring, so useless --
M	GWENOVIER	I would just want to clear some things up:
F	FRANK	Thank you, Muffy. Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
M	GWENOVIER	This isn't meant --
F	FRANK	-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
M	GWENOVIER	Are you asking me that?
F	FRANK	Yes.
M	GWENOVIER	Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
F	FRANK	In aid of what?
M	GWENOVIER	I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
F	FRANK	-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself into --
M	GWENOVIER	It's all important --
F	FRANK	Not really.
M	GWENOVIER	It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
F	FRANK	This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
M	GWENOVIER	We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
F	FRANK	I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
M	GWENOVIER	Do you remember a Miss Simms?
F	FRANK	I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
M	GWENOVIER	She does. From when you were a boy.
F	FRANK	Mm. Hm.
M	GWENOVIER	She lived in Tarzana.
F	FRANK	An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
M	GWENOVIER	No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
F	FRANK	Go ahead and waste your time.
M	GWENOVIER	I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
F	FRANK	And that's what you've heard?
M	GWENOVIER	I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
M	GWENOVIER	In my research I have you listed as the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge. And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that your mother passed away in 1980. See: It's my understanding that the information supplied by you and your company and answers to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank. And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you are and why you are then I think your family history -- you're accurate family history...well: this seems important...Frank...? Frank lights his cigarette. CAMERA zooms into CU.
F	FRANK	Are you asking me a question?
M	GWEN	Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
F	JIMMY	Kids, Adults, I'd like you to put yourself at a picnic. Place yourself there with your family and friends if you'd like -- you'll hear three musical notes and you are to tell me what it might represent that you'd find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes:
M	TODD	Well, Jimmy, I know this, I have perfect pitch, you see -- and that would be A-D-E. And that would represent lemonade.
F	JIMMY	For 250. Next notes, please: Got it. That's E-G-G which would be ~egg."
F	JIMMY	For 500 and the Third Set Of Notes: B-E-E -- and don't get stung.
M	KLIGMAN	You don't want any water?
F	LINDA	I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
M	KLIGMAN	Are you on drugs right now?
F	LINDA	If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
M	KLIGMAN	Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
F	LINDA	Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
M	KLIGMAN	Linda, you're safe. Ok. It's alright. You're my friend. You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
F	LINDA	-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
M	KLIGMAN	You can't change his will. Only Earl can change his will.
F	LINDA	No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl. When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand? I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments... I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
F	JIMMY	Let's listen:
M	VOICE	"Hello, Mary. How are you and the seven kids? As you probably heard by know, we sure gave that Pope a run for his money --"
M	MIM	Well: That would be General Robert E. Lee. His wife Mary Park Custiss. And he did have seven children and he would be talking about Pope, who he defeated at the Battle of Monasses --
M	RICK	C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, snap out of it. "Hello, Josephine, I'm speaking from Egypt --"
F	JIMMY	Mim --
M	MIM	Well that would be Napoleon speaking to Josephine.
F	JIMMY	That's right!
F	LINDA	I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
M	KLIGMAN	What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
F	LINDA	This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around. I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
M	KLIGMAN	Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
F	LINDA	I can't.
M	KLIGMAN	You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
F	LINDA	Where will the money go?
M	KLIGMAN	Well. Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
F	LINDA	What does that mean?
M	KLIGMAN	The money would go to Frank. The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
F	LINDA	-- that can't happen. Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
M	KLIGMAN	-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
F	LINDA	This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
M	KLIGMAN	Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
F	LINDA	Shut the fuck up.
M	KLIGMAN	I'm trying to help, Linda --
F	LINDA	Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
M	KLIGMAN	You need to sober up.
F	LINDA	Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
M	KLIGMAN	Linda --
F	LINDA	I have to go.
M	KLIGMAN	Let me call you a car, Linda.
F	LINDA	Shut the fuck up.
F	JIMMY	Imagine you are attending a jam session of classical composers and they have each done an arrangment of the classic favorite, "Whispering." Here are three variations on the theme, as three classic composer's might have written it -- you are to name the composer. The First:
M	TODD (OC)	Well, Jimmy that sounded to me like Brahms, a bit like his Hungarian Dance Number Six, I believe.
M	JIMMY (OC)	Excellent. Next number:
F	JIMMY	Stanley the Man -- answer:
M	STANLEY	...I don't know the answer...
M	JIMMY GATOR	That is not right! That's not right, Stanley, the answer is...Ravel....Ravel.... ....xhjksndlsmnop.....
M	FLOOR DIRECTOR	What the fuck is wrong with him? fading fast --
M	DIRECTOR	I need a better cutaway, go to the black chick, Camera Three, Camera Three the black chick --
M	BURT	Get the technical difficulty card up --
M	BURT	Cut it, go to the card, go to the fucking card --
M	DIRECTOR	Go to the card, now -- go -- The card that reads, "Technical Difficulty," comes up and holds.
F	CLAUDIA	Ok, ok. I'm back.
M	JIM KURRING	This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
F	CLAUDIA	Thank you.
F	CLAUDIA	What do you wanna talk about?
F	RICHARD	Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
M	STANLEY	Shut up -- shut up --
F	CYNTHIA	What happend, what's going on?
M	STANLEY	NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
F	CYNTHIA	Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
M	RICK	What's the problem, what's the problem here?
M	STANLEY	I'm fine. nothing.
M	RICK	Why didn't you answer those questions?
M	STANLEY	I didn't know the answer --
M	RICK	Bullshit. Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
M	STANLEY	I don't know.
F	RICHARD	He pissed his pants.
M	RICK	Did you -- did you --
M	STANLEY	I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
M	RICK	Stand up.
M	STANLEY	I said I'm fine.
M	RICK	...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
M	STANLEY	I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
M	RICK	Why did you do this? Jimmy is sweating.
F	JIMMY	I had a stroke, I think I had a stroke.
M	BURT	Call 911. Call 911 right now.
F	JIMMY	No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
M	BURT	no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
F	JIMMY	I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
M	BURT	Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
F	JIMMY	You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands. Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
M	BURT	Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
F	JIMMY	Shut it. Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
M	RICK	Are we gonna keep going with this game?
M	STANLEY	Yes.
M	RICK	You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
M	STANLEY	Alright.
M	RICK	hang in there, ok. I love you.
M	FLOOR DIRECTOR	What are we doing?
M	BURT	This is fuckin' stupidity, we'll get back on and go through it --
M	GWENOVIER (OC)	Frank...Frank...what are we gonna do here? Are we having a staring contest? Do you have anything to say? I think maybe we should rap this up, Chief --
M	GWENOVIER (OC)	I'm not trying to attack you, Frank. I think that if you have something that needs to be cleared up...Well, then... I was told that your father, (your father is Earl Partridge,) that he left you and your mother and you were forced to take care of her during her illness...that you took care of your mother as she struggled with Cancer.... And Miss Simms became your caretaker after your mother died...Frank...Frank... Frank, can you talk about your Mother? Frank....can you?
F	CLAUDIA	--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
M	JIM KURRING	What's that stand for?
F	CLAUDIA	Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
M	JIM KURRING	This is my job.
F	CLAUDIA	We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
M	JIM KURRING	Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
F	CLAUDIA	If you're not here for a 422 --
M	JIM KURRING	No. No. Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia. Please, now.
F	CLAUDIA	I'm sorry.
M	JIM KURRING	Ok, then. Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
F	CLAUDIA	Yes. I will. It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
M	JIM KURRING	Just Jim.
F	CLAUDIA	yeah, good, ok.
M	JIM KURRING	Bye, bye, Claudia.
F	CLAUDIA	Good bye.
M	JIM KURRING	I'm sorry, Claudia.
F	CLAUDIA	What is it? Did you forget something?
M	JIM KURRING	No, no. I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
F	CLAUDIA	You wanna go on a date with me?
M	JIM KURRING	Please, yes.
F	CLAUDIA	Well...is that illegal?
M	JIM KURRING	No.
F	CLAUDIA	Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
M	JIM KURRING	I don't know. I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it. I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
F	CLAUDIA	Really?
M	JIM KURRING	Yeah.
F	CLAUDIA	I thought you were flirting with me a little.
F	CLAUDIA	Do you wanna go tonight? I mean, are you working?
M	JIM KURRING	No, I'm off tonight. I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time? What time?
F	CLAUDIA	Eight o'clock?
M	JIM KURRING	What about ten o'clock, is that too late? I don't get off and then --
F	CLAUDIA	Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good. Should I get dressed up or -- ?
M	JIM KURRING	No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
F	CLAUDIA	Billingsley's?
M	JIM KURRING	Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
F	CLAUDIA	It's my favorite place --
M	JIM KURRING	Oh, see? This is great. Ten o'clock.
F	CLAUDIA	Great, bye.
M	JIM KURRING	Bye.

M	THURSTON	"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
F	DONNIE	-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question. I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form. "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids! Full of useless thoughts, eh?" Thank you. Thank you. And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us." And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.

F	FRANK	Uh. huh.
M	PHIL	It's interesting.
F	FRANK	Mmm. Dixon eats same pudding. Worm mumbles to him, various jabs. Worm sits into FRAME, near to Stanley. Stanley glances up, they

M	DIXON	Hello? Hello? I have an emergency situation -- this lady -- this lady seems like she's dead -- hello?
F	JIMMY	I don't think I want that.
F	ROSE	It'll take the pain away.
F	JIMMY	It's not really pain.
F	JIMMY	I gotta ask you for a cigarette, 'cause I don't wanna spend six hours tryin' to get it to my mouth --
F	JIMMY	How do we do this, then?
F	ROSE	We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
F	JIMMY	Do you love me, Rose?
F	ROSE	You're my handsome man.
F	JIMMY	I'm a bad person.
F	ROSE	No. No.
F	JIMMY	No, I mean: I'm telling you this, now. You see? You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
F	ROSE	You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins? Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
F	JIMMY	--- don't. don't. Please. Just... listen to me...honey.... ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
F	JIMMY	I've cheated on you and it kills me and the guilt of what I've done...I don't want you to think...maybe you knew, I think that maybe you've known... So I hope that I'm not saying this for me...for me to make myself feel better about what I've done...but for making you not feel like you're sitting there like a jerk...you've been the good one... You understand...I'm so sorry for all I've done wrong...and this is pathetic...what? "Dying man, confess the sins" something? Is it selfish for me to say this? To say what I've done...I feel better already. I do...do you hate me?
F	ROSE	...No...I don't hate you. Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
F	JIMMY	Yeah.
F	ROSE	The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
F	JIMMY	Will that help?
F	ROSE	Yeah.
F	CLAUDIA	Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
M	JIM KURRING	Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something. They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
F	CLAUDIA	So you've done it --
M	JIM KURRING	Well I don't go out very much.
F	CLAUDIA	Why not?
M	JIM KURRING	I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
F	CLAUDIA	And I bet you say that to all the girls --
M	JIM KURRING	No, no.
F	CLAUDIA	You wanna make a deal with me?
M	JIM KURRING	ok.
F	CLAUDIA	What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
M	JIM KURRING	...yeah...
F	CLAUDIA	To not do that. To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
M	JIM KURRING	Let's make a deal.
F	CLAUDIA	Ok. I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
M	JIM KURRING	Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
F	CLAUDIA	What?
M	JIM KURRING	You really use strong language.
F	CLAUDIA	I'm sorry --
M	JIM KURRING	-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
F	CLAUDIA	I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
M	JIM KURRING	It's fine.
F	CLAUDIA	I'm sorry.
M	JIM KURRING	...nothing. I'm sorry...
F	CLAUDIA	No, I'm sorry. I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
M	JIM KURRING	-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
F	CLAUDIA	I'm sorry.
F	CLAUDIA	I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --

F	CLAUDIA	I wanted to do that.
M	JIM KURRING	Well.
F	CLAUDIA	That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
M	JIM KURRING	Yeah.
F	CLAUDIA	Can I tell you something?
M	JIM KURRING	Yeah, of course.
F	CLAUDIA	I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon. That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
M	JIM KURRING	-- no, like what, what do you mean?
F	CLAUDIA	You're a police officer. You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
M	JIM KURRING	I lost my gun.
F	CLAUDIA	What?
M	JIM KURRING	I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people. I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
F	CLAUDIA	Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
M	JIM KURRING	I'm sorry --
F	CLAUDIA	That was so great what you just said.
M	JIM KURRING	I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
F	CLAUDIA	You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
M	JIM KURRING	It's ok.

F	JIMMY	Do you know the answer to this?
F	ROSE	I'm asking you. I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
F	JIMMY	I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
F	JIMMY	She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something. She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
F	ROSE	Did you ever touch her?
F	JIMMY	...No....
F	ROSE	Jimmy, did you touch her?
F	JIMMY	I don't know.
F	ROSE	...Jimmy...

F	JIMMY	...I don't know...
F	JIMMY	What...? ...no...no, please...
F	ROSE	You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
F	JIMMY	I don't know what I've done.
F	ROSE	Yes you do.
F	JIMMY	Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
F	ROSE	No.
F	JIMMY	I don't know what I've done.
F	ROSE	You should know better.

M	STANLEY	You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
M	RICK	Go to bed.
M	STANLEY	I think that you have to be nicer to me.
M	RICK	Go to bed.
M	NARRATOR	...and so it goes and so it goes and the book says, "We may be through with the past, but the past is not through with us."
F	MARCIE	I killed him. I killed my husband. He hit my son and he hit my grandson and I hit him. I hit him with the ashtray and he was knocked out and I killed him, I strangled him. I strangled my husband to protect my boys. I protected my boys.
F	DONNIE	I know that I did a thtupid thing. Tho-thtupid...getting brathes...I thought... I thought that he would love me. ...getting brathes, for what... for thumthing I didn't even...i don't know where to put things, y'know?
F	DONNIE	I really do hath love to give, I juth don't know where to put it --
M	JIM KURRING	...these security systems can be a real joke. I mean, a frog falls from the sky and lands on the x-4 box 'round back and opens all the doors? Triggers a siutation? You don't know who could be driving by at any moment, walk in and rob the place -- I was you I'd talk to your boss about a new security system --
F	DONNIE	....ohh-thur-I-thur-thill....
M	JIM KURRING	You guys make alotta money, huh?
M	JIM KURRING (OC)	I got a buddy a mine down at the med. center, he'd probably do quite a deal on a set of dentures, you're interested in that. He's in training, you know he's not a dentist yet, but he's real good at corrective oral surgery from what I understand...
M	JIM KURRING	...alot of people think this is just a job that you go to.....take a lunch hour, the jobs over, something like that. But...it's a 24 hour deal...no two ways about it....and what most people don't see: Just How Hard It Is To Do The Right Thing. People think if I make a judgment call that it's a judgment on them...but that's not what I do and that's not what should be done...I have to take everything and play it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail. And that's a very tricky thing on my part...making that call...the law is the law and heck if I'm gonna break it...but you can forgive someone....? Well, that's the tough part....What Do We Forgive? Tough part of the job.....tough part of walking down the street...
