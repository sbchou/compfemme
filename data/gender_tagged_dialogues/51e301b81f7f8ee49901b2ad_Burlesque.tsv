M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	TESS	Once upon a time ...a long, looong time ago... there was a good little girl...and they called her... REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes,
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Burlesque. MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Some say she up and died-of neglect. Abandonment. .old age. The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd. But I say...no matter how hard you try, you can't keep a good girl down. And I've got a bevy of 'em. Come to think of it, none of them are all that good, which isn't all that bad... SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories
M	TESS (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Eight shows a week. Sixteen gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers of luscious legs... Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse. Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl. The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights,
M	TESS (CONT'D)	All of them the creme-de la creme. De la creme. The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc...
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Each one a bastion of bodacious... Elegance. TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Not to mention their other... Ass-ets. Coco raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge, dead smack in the center of the Sunset Strip-- did I say "strip?" I meant TEASE... FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their
F	ALI	Uh, excuse me? You forgot something. He turns. Sees: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on
M	REGULAR	No, that's your tip.
F	ALI	Huh. See, now that's interesting -- you and I must do math completely differently, cause me? I start with the six beers I brought you, add the four spills I cleaned up, the five times I refilled your peanuts, plus the three times you "accidentally" touched my ass, then I tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for you, twice, and I come up with a sum that's a hell of a lot more than twenty-five cents. Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA --
F	LORETTA	She's just teasing, Ike. You go on home now, and tell Kay I said hi. The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter.
M	LORETTA (CONT'D)	It's better than nothing.
F	ALI	Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an insult.
F	LORETTA	It'll cover half a load down at the Spanky Clean.
F	ALI	There's only one thing a quarter is good for. Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room,
F	LORETTA	Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight feels about that.
F	ALI	Dwight isn't here. Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine.
F	LORETTA	He could come back any minute.
F	ALI	Tough. I'm not working here for the tips Loretta. She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song.
M	FEELING, Y-E-A-H	And now we see where the confidence comes from. She's got a IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali is belting now. Loretta is torn between As other ENTERTAINERS appear onstage:
F	TESS	The insatiable La Puccini Triplets! Death-defying daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille! The Countess of contortion, Eva Destruction! And how about a little love for those bad boys of burlesque, our naughty- bawdy bumber band! THE TATTOOED BAND blares as the troupe kicks in unison IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings, with a powerful vocal quality ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the GIRLS and the BAND, loud and
M	OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!	IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting loose now. Wailing. ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the BURLESQUE GIRLS move in a line IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting it rip. The Geezer sips his ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls. IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali. ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls form a line. IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings. IN THE BURLESQUE LOUNGE, The Girls, Tess, the other IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali finishes the song. Loretta CLAPS. The
F	LORETTA	People around here wouldn't know talent if it bit 'em in the Danglies. Where you gotta go is Des Moines. They got karaoke bars where you can win a hundred bucks a night.
F	ALI	Loretta-- when I get out of this butt-hole of a town, I sure as shit won't be heading for Des Moines. She hops up onto the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg Tess comes off stage and bumrushes Sean.
F	TESS	Where the hell is Nikki?
M	SEAN	Rehab, if there's a God. The BACKSTAGE DOOR BURSTS OPEN revealing--
F	NIKKI	I heard that. Nikki, a stunning, feisty brunette, sashays in--
F	TESS	Jesus, Nikki, you're later than Georgia's period! Where were you?
F	NIKKI	Weave, wax, paws and claws. She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out
F	TESS	Hold it right there. Weigh in. Nikki unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Put on five pounds or I bump you. Nikki protests as Sean double-takes at Georgia -- who FLITS
F	ALI	Nanna? Got your pot roast here!
F	ALI	They were out of steak fries, so I got you some of those... Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna -- 80's, housecoat,
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Nanna?
M	YOUNG MINISTER	Dear Lord, we gather here today not to mourn, but to celebrate the life of Alison Rose.
F	ALI	Arlene.
M	YOUNG MINISTER	What?
F	ALI	She's Arlene. I'm Alison.
M	YOUNG MINISTER	Oh, shit. Can I start over? Ali rolls her eyes.
M	LATER,	The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali
F	LORETTA	You were real good to her, Ali.
F	ALI	No, she was good to me. She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	And she wasn't even my real Nanna.
F	LORETTA	What...?
F	ALI	Foster care. She took me in for the checks. When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could've kicked me out, but she didn't. She had a lot of pain at the end. Nothing she talked about, but I could tell.
F	LORETTA	Well, then I guess this is a blessing. Now she's free. ON ALI, thinking realizing:
F	ALI	Yeah. I guess she is. In the wings, Tess watches with Sean.
F	TESS	Girls look good tonight.
M	SEAN	Amazing what a pink spotlight can do. Hides more cellulite than a burka.
M	DWIGHT	You're three days late.
F	ALI	I had a death in the family.
M	DWIGHT	And what, people stop drinking cause your grandma died? Get your apron and get to work.
F	ALI	I'm not here to work. I'm leaving.
F	LORETTA	You are?
F	ALI	Yeah. I just came for my back pay.
M	DWIGHT	Payday's the end of the month.
F	ALI	But, I won't be here then. And you owe me for three weeks.
M	DWIGHT	I don't owe anyone anything till the end of the month. Ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him.
F	ALI	You know what, Dwight? Contrary to what you've been told, there's no law in Grundy that says you have to spend every waking minute being a tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick --
F	LORETTA	Ooh, hon, I'm not sure that particular approach is gonna --
F	ALI	I've spent three years of my life
M	DWIGHT	--And you'll probably spend another three. You want to quit? Good riddance. I'll replace you before you hit the county line, but I sure ain't gonna pay for the privilege. He walks out the back door, slamming it behind him. ANGLE ON: THE CASH REGISTER. Ali opens the drawer, pulls out
F	LORETTA	What are you doing?
F	ALI	I'm only taking what he owes me. How much was that bike you been wanting for little Keith? Ali STUFFS a few TWENTIES into Loretta's apron-- pockets the
F	LORETTA	Ali-- where are you gonna go?
F	ALI	Somewhere I can breathe. Now gimme a hug, I gotta get out of here before he gets back. Loretta hugs her tight, then looks Ali in the eye, concerned.
F	LORETTA	You can't just head off into the sunset without a plan. Watch me. Ali gives her one more hug, then grabs her bag and leaves.
M	OLDER WOMAN	She'll be back. As Ali heads off, we HEAR:
F	ALI	How much to Los Angeles?
M	TICKET BOOTH GUY	One way or round-trip?
F	ALI	You're kidding, right? IN THE WINGS, Tess hands Sean her corset as she slips into a
M	SEAN	They're loving you tonight.
F	TESS	They're loving you.
M	SEAN	Oh, shucks, I just tell myself I'm writing for a big old drag queen.
F	TESS	Eat me. As he heads off with her discarded costume:
M	SEAN	A big old foul-mouthed drag queen! Tess looks in a mirror. As she makes the necessary
M	VINCE	Good show tonight. She glances up, sees him. Gets icy. Goes back to primping.
M	VINCE (CONT'D)	Too bad the club's half-empty.
F	TESS	Half-full.
M	VINCE	I got another call from Marcus Gerber.
F	TESS	And you told him we weren't selling.
M	VINCE	He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.
F	TESS	Vince, I don't care what the number is; the only way Marcus Gerber will get this club from me is by prying it out of my cold, dead, heavily- jeweled fingers. She pivots away and sweeps into the club. Big finish, the number on stage ends. Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED
M	RADIO	102.7 KIIS FM. Broadcasting from Hollywood and Vine... Ali perks up-- looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend
F	ALI	Okay! Well. Good luck with that. He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Oh, hang on. She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels If I could just get a little -- But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves,
M	ALI (CONT'D)	-- change. She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then She removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Hey. I thought this was a single. The cat curls up next to her. She checks his junk.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Typical. First guy I meet is neutered. You don't happen to know anyone in the music business, do you? Singer/Actress... Singer/Songwriter .Singer/Scuba diver? Perfect. ON ANOTHER AD: It says: "SINGER/WAITRESS WANTED." MUSIC UP:
M	SKINNY GUY	Sorry, ladies, that's all the applications we're taking today. CLOSE ON: an ad: "DANCERS WANTED. PRETTY GIRLS ONLY."
F	ALI	I can dance.
M	DRUNK GUY	She'll be back. Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses
M	ALEXIS	Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH! ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make- Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who
F	NIKKI	Didn't your Mama tell you it's not polite to stare?
F	ALI	Sorry, you're just -- so DAMN beautiful. In that case, screw your Mama, stare away. Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They
M	AL I	No one would ever guess.
F	NIKKI	What?
F	ALI	That you're a dude. Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Oh, shit.
F	NIKKI	"Shit's" right, you little half-wit Nikki is about to unleash when the stage door opens.
M	SEAN	Bitch! You're on! Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF
F	ALI	I'm really sor-- The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads. Alexis sits on a stool, glaring down at her.
F	ALI	What is this place? A strip club?
M	ALEXIS	Strip club? Honey, I ought to wash your mouth out with Jaegermeister. The only pole you'll find in here is Natasha the shot girl. Ali looks back at the photos. Babycakes, shit or get off the throne, I got a club to fill here. Ali digs her ID out, hands it over. Alexis scans it --
M	ALEXIS (CONT'D)	Twenty bucks. Ali looks in her wallet. Sees one lone twenty inside. She Ali ENTERS, rounds a pillar, staring out into the room as a
F	TESS	Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have the best view on the Sunset Strip! MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the back of the stage, The girls hit the beats, turning upside-down on cabaret
M	JACK	Get you a drink? She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25,
F	ALI	Only if you're buying.
M	JACK	Welcome to L.A. Is it that obvious?
M	JACK	You still have that new-car smell.
F	ALI	Not brand new. But still under warranty.
M	JACK	Where you from? She looks back at the stage, mesmerized.
F	ALI	Iowa.
M	JACK	Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're practically related.
F	ALI	I thought you looked familiar. He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a
M	JACK	Hey_. Go. The Waitress picks up the tray -- almost spilling the drinks - Damn...
M	JACK	They don't build 'em like this in Iowa, huh?
F	ALI	Hell no. I wouldn't have left. She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	So tell me -- who does a girl flirt with to get from here... to there?
M	JACK	Is this you flirting?
F	ALI	With someone wearing more eyeliner than me? He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading
M	JACK	Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt away. As she heads off--
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Hey, Iowa-- use my name. He hands her a card. She looks at it:
F	ALI	Thanks, Jack. She smiles, slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door. In the middle of the maelstrom sits Tess, at a mirror,
F	ALI	Excuse me. I'm looking for Tess.
F	TESS	So am I. And sometimes, when the lights are dim, and I squint my eyes ...I can still see her. She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets,
F	ALI	Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm-
F	TESS	New in town.
F	ALI	Yes, and I'm--
F	TESS	Looking for a job.
F	ALI	Yes, and I--
F	TESS	Want to perform here.
F	ALI	Yes. Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I'm a singer. A good one.
F	TESS	This is a dance show.
F	ALI	I can dance.
F	TESS	Really? You a professional?
F	ALI	I'm a quick study.
F	TESS	Not on my dime. Tess stands, a final check in the mirror. Ali sees her chance
F	ALI	Okay, I get that you're busy so I won't waste any more of your time-- but this place-- I've just never seen anything like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of it?
F	TESS	Twenty bucks at the door can make all your dreams come true. Tess strides out, not looking back. Ali sees the Girls
F	ALI	One Dewar's neat, one shot of Patron, and get this, tough-guy in the hat? He wants a Cosmo. Jack looks at her, surprised. Impressed.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	One night. If I'm not 20 times better than boobs-for-brains over there, you don't have to pay me. weaving their way through the tables. WIDEN to see she now She heads back to the bar with empties, eyes glued to the
F	ALI	Her leg went behind her head!
M	JACK	Yeah, Coco's the real deal.
F	ALI	I want to do that.
M	JACK	She used to dance with the Joffrey Ballet. Nikki sang opera. Eva performed with Cirque. Everyone here's a pro. And you're on!
M	BACKSTAGE,	Nikki, lined up with the other girls, peers between the
F	NIKKI	What's she doing here?! I want that bitch out. Now.
M	SEAN	What'd she do to you?
F	NIKKI	She thought I was a drag queen! Stifled giggles from the girls.
M	SEAN	Can't be the first time THAT'S happened. Nikki is about to haul off on Sean when the CURTAIN OPENS, she turns, flashing her best stage smile as she joins Coco From the floor, Ali serves drinks, takes care of customers,
F	ALI	When he kisses me I get a thrill... The Cat MEOWS and slinks out from behind the bed. Ali pulls And when he does that wiggle I can't keep still Cause he's a tough lover.. . ON THE FLOOR, Ali delivers a tray of drinks to a table of
F	ALI	Thanks. She heads back to the bar. As Jack loads her tray up, she
M	SEAN	Okay, girl, time for Sean to give you a real tip. He ties her shirt up higher, undoes the top few buttons...
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	You got lips that could suck the chrome off a Peterbilt, but that matte is about as sexy as a bedpan. As Sean wipes off Ali's lipstick, then whips out a tube of
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	Now baby, go show 'em what you got. He heads off. While Eva performs onstage, Ali delivers the When Ali gets to him:
F	MARCUS	Dewar's on the rocks for me. Bottle of Dom for the table and-- --And tell Nikki I'm here. Ali starts away, then--
F	ALI	And you are?
F	MARCUS	A member since 1991. Oh-kay. He smiles, wickedly handsome. Ali pivots and heads
M	JACK	Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom, keep it coming.
F	ALI	So Asshole's a regular?
M	JACK	Marcus Gerber. Real estate guy.
F	ALI	He's with Nikki?
M	JACK	This week. Vince goes over to Marcus's table, shakes hands, joins him.
F	ALI	Who's that with him?
M	JACK	Technically your boss: Vince Scali. Tess's partner. And ex... Jack is about to lift the AmEx off the tray, when Sean swoops
M	SEAN	A black AmEx! The backstage pass to life! He sees Coco walking by, swipes the AmEx in her cleavage.
F	COCO	Access denied!
M	SEAN	Now there's a first! Jack sees Ali laughing at their banter. She heads off with
M	ON STAGE	LIGHTS UP on TESS, CENTER STAGE as she begins a new number, ON THE FLOOR, Nikki is sitting in Marcus's lap, nibbling his
M	VINCE	She's on the verge.
F	MARCUS	That's what you said last time.
M	VINCE	She has no choice. We owe a balloon payment of 100 grand on the first, she took out a second to buy me out of the condo. And she just got turned down for another loan today.
F	MARCUS	There's a handful of these clubs around town, I could buy one of them tomorrow.
M	VINCE	But it wouldn't be in the heart of the Sunset Strip.
M	AT THE BAR,	Ali brings a tray of empties over. Sean is there.
F	ALI	She's funny.
M	SEAN	Thanks. My lines. Our secret. Jack gives Sean his drink. He walks off. MUSIC UP: An Jack notices Ali watching the stage... she lights up and Song CONTINUES over a SERIES OF SHOTS: IN THE CLUB, BURLESQUE GIRLS strike a similar pose ON ALI'S BED, Ali flips to a picture of Mae West IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali eats Chinese take-out as she pores IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali, in the bath, still reading, turns IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali vamps, dancing to the song in her The cat watches her, yawns and slinks away. IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali thwacks down on an old mustard- FIND Ali, in her waitress outfit, watching the girls on
F	TESS	Nikki, do you even own a watch? Or do you measure time in Patron shots? Ali enters with a tray of drinks. Nikki swipes one.
F	ALI	Hey, no, that's for -- Nikki opens a bottle, pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them
M	ALI (CONT'D)	You, I guess. Nikki turns to the mirror and starts getting to work. As Ali Tess? Do you have a second? Tess doesn't answer. But a slight glance at Ali in the
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I was thinking -- see, I grew up listening to all this music, I'd play the records over and over --
F	TESS	Fast-forward, babe. I gotta rebuild Rome in the next two minutes--
F	ALI	Now see-- that's what I've been thinking about. There's one thing I don't get.
F	TESS	Just one?
F	ALI	It's the vocals. You have the girls lip-synching. which is fine, I guess, but wouldn't it be so much better if they actually sang? The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali's overstepping here. Ali
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I've been reading up on it, and back when burlesque started, that's what they did. Silence. Nobody moves. All eyes on Tess.
M	SEAN	Oh, no she didn't? Tess slowly spins around in her chair to face Ali. Peers at
F	TESS	"When burlesque started"? Which was...when?
F	ALI	Oh. Well... this book said it came after...
F	TESS	Vaudeville -- is the word you're looking for. Derived from the 15th- century French expression "voix de ville" -- "voice of the city". Popular songs of the time that were strung together into stage shows. Which, over time, gave birth to another kind of show in which talented girls showing a bit more skin danced, did skits, and, _ yes, sang. In addition to being raunchier, these shows were funnier, hence the new name. "Burlesque": "comical" in French. Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Dance major. Juilliard. I did my thesis on Burlesque.
F	ALI	Oh. Ok. It's just-- It's just that ...I CAN sing and--
F	TESS	We can all sing. But they don't come to hear us sing. They come to see the best dancers in town backed by the greatest singers in history. But tell you what: when you find someone with better pipes than Sarah Vaughn, Billie Holiday and Etta James-- you let me know. She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with what's left
F	ALI	Georgia? You okay in there? A FLUSH. The stall door opens. Georgia comes out shakily
F	GEORGIA	I don't know why they call it morning sickness when it hits at every freakin hour of the day. She rinses her mouth out at the sink.
F	ALI	There aren't many women who could dance the Charleston on a chair at - - what are you, three months? Georgia turns sideways to the mirror, inspecting her bump.
F	GEORGIA	Four. Can you believe my boyfriend hasn't noticed yet?
F	ALI	You haven't told him?
F	GEORGIA	I guess as long as he doesn't know, I can still imagine he'll be happy about it. Oh my God, look what the cat dragged in. She gets to work wiping away her smudged mascara.
F	ALI	You look pretty hot to me. Georgia reaches into her corset, yanks one breast skyward,
F	GEORGIA	Yeah, well -- you take what Mother Nature gave you and milk the hell out of it, right? Coco enters carrying a glass of tonic for Georgia.
M	GEORGIA (CONT'D)	Thanks, Coco. Shouldn't you be on the floor?
F	ALI	I had to pee. Is that okay with you?
F	COCO	Not when you're blocking my mirror it's not. Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside:
M	COCO (CONT'D)	That's us. You okay, or are you gonna puke on me during the number?
F	GEORGIA	I can't make any promises. Coco drags her out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself
F	ALI	Hey! They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her
M	ALI (CONT'D)	No. No! She runs down the hall.
F	ALI	No!!! God damn it!!! She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off,
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it! She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	A lotta help you were. The cat creeps out, slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Shit. Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO she took from Nanna's. She takes the picture out of the broken frame, smooths it out
M	JACK	Ali? What's wrong? You okay? She tries to speak, but can't -- so she just nods.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Really? Cause, in my experience-- when you're on someone's doorstep surrounded by everything you own, there's usually a not-so-good story And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry.
M	JACK	Shit. No way!
F	ALI	Came in -- busted the lock-- and stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!! She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only
M	ALI (CONT'D)	And there's no way I-- sleep there-- with-- like that-- the manager said- - not till Monday-- and I don't-- anyone else-- but then-- so I remembered I had...but it went straight to...so I... She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that
M	JACK	Okay. I have no idea what you just said, but come on in here and we'll get it sorted out. She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest
M	JACK	Have a seat. I'll get us BOTH a drink. Here -- He hands her his phone. She looks at it. -- call whoever you want, long- distance, whatever--
F	ALI	I can't.
M	JACK	Sure you can. Go ahead. Her chin starts quivering all over again.
F	ALI	I.. .don't ...have anyone.
M	JACK	What do you mean?
F	ALI	To call.
M	JACK	No parents? Siblings? Aunts? Uncles? Friends? No one! No one, okay? Do I have to spell it out for you? I am -- completely -- alone! Jack susses out the situation. So...you're not here to use my phone. She starts to cry again.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Okay. Wait. No, stop, stop, stop, it's okay, it's fine. You'll crash here. No problem. Just, please -- no more crying. She nods. He grabs a bottle of Tequila and a couple of
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Better? She nods.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Okay. Good. She wipes her eyes.
F	ALI	Just for one night, I swear. Just till it's light outside and I can figure out my next move.
M	JACK	Deal. Then she opens her small bag and the cat strolls out.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Whoa, whoa, you didn't say anything about a cat.
F	ALI	What? You don't like cats? It slinks around his leg. He shakes it off.
M	JACK	I hate cats.
F	ALI	How can you hate a cat?
M	JACK	It's easy, I'll show you. The cat bolts into the bedroom.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Where's it going? If that thing pees on my bed --
F	ALI	He goes outside. We just have to open a window. He's very independent. She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I don't have a name for him yet. It purrs. Jack eyes it warily.
M	JACK	One night?
F	ALI	One night.
F	ALI	You're good.
M	JACK	Thanks.
F	ALI	Why don't you play at the club?
M	JACK	Make more money bartending.
F	ALI	You in a band?
M	JACK	Was... Guitarist moved to Reno, Drummer went to med school, bassist is in rehab. I'm subbing around town till I regroup. This is for a punk fusion band -- their keyboardist is a flake, so they call me a lot. A flaky punk-rock-fusion keyboardist? No way. He smiles. Continues playing. HIGH ANGLE, seeing both of them on either side of a wall.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Hey... He stops playing again.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Why'd you leave Kentucky?
M	JACK	Why'd you leave Iowa?
F	ALI	Cause I looked around and realized there wasn't one person whose life I wanted.
M	JACK	Exactly. A beat. Then as he starts playing again:
F	ALI	Hey Jack? He stops again.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Thank you. I'm really glad I'm not alone tonight. He smiles.
M	JACK	Get some sleep. He continues playing. She closes her eyes. CLOSE ON: THE CAT'S FACE, staring right into camera.
M	JACK	Aauuuugggghh. He hurls the cat away and bolts out of bed, disgusted.
F	ALI	Morning. Coffee? Black. Like my soul. She pours him a cup. Sees a picture of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL on
F	ALI	She's pretty. Your sister?
M	JACK	My fiancee. Natalie.
F	ALI	Fiancee? You're straight?
M	JACK	Of course I'm straight. You thought I was gay?
F	ALI	Yes?
M	JACK	Why?
F	ALI	I don't know, the...make-up?
M	JACK	It's a look.
F	ALI	Okay.
M	JACK	A straight look.
F	ALI	Okay. And the floral couch...?
M	ALI/JACK	Natalie. As Ali realizes she's barely dressed in front of a straight
F	ALI	I should put on pants.
M	JACK	Probably. She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her
F	ALI	Where is she?
M	JACK	New York. Doing a play.
F	ALI	For how long?
M	JACK	Six more weeks. She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing Oh, God, now I feel bad about this.
M	JACK	For what?
F	ALI	I don't know. Now that you're straight and engaged, it feels weird that I came here.
M	JACK	Well, you did, and it was fine. Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Or at least it will be as soon as you get dressed. She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture.
F	ALI	Alrighty then-- I'll get outta your hair now...
M	JACK	Wait, where're you headed?
F	ALI	Oh, don't worry about me. I've got a plan. Come on, cat. She zips the cat into the bag he came in.
M	JACK	Hang on, let me at least spot you some cash. I'm a little strapped, but I could --
F	ALI	No, I'm good, if you could just She nods at the door. He opens it for her.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Thank you. For everything. You are my knight in shining... eyeliner.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I'll see you at the club.
M	JACK	Cool. She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there.
M	JACK	So, this plan of yours?
F	ALI	.was to sit here at the bus stop and come up with a plan.
M	JACK	Come back inside.
F	ALI	No, Jack, I--
F	ALI	I'll figure it out, this is not
M	JACK	It's pouring!
F	ALI	It's only water for chrissakes--
F	ALI	Jack-- you've done enough and-- In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Jack-- No! Stop it! He grabs her bags and carries her back across the street-- He sets her down--
M	JACK	Look, you have nowhere to go, I have a couch. You may as well stay here for a few days.
F	ALI	You really don't need to do that. I'll be fine --
M	JACK	You'll be homeless. You always have this much trouble saying yes when someone is trying to help you?
M	AL I	It's never happened before. The Cat jumps up on the back of a chair, all wet, and SHAKES,
M	JACK/ALI	Aaaaargh! As his PHONE RINGS.
M	JACK	There's a towel in the bathroom-- dry yourself and that damn cat off. Ali collects the cat-- heads for the bathroom. Jack checks Hey, baby, how's it going?... Really? That's awesome... That...? Just this person from work What? No, she's just a friend, I'm helping her out. Nat, it's nothing. O.S. MUSIC UP: "BABY YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES" by Brook
F	TESS	Okay, front row, thank you very much. They walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	What happened to all the great dancers in L.A?
M	SEAN	They're busy "Dancing with the Stars." Last group, please. HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from ON THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards,
F	TESS	All right, ladies, and five, six, seven -- whoa. There, in the back row, is Ali, in her white platform shoes.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	What the hell do you think you're doing? Coco and Georgia ENTER-- surprised to see Ali on stage.
F	ALI	Trying out.
F	TESS	I don't think so.
F	ALI	Tess, I've been singing and dancing my whole life and--
F	TESS	The girls here have years of training and experience. This stage is for serious and professional
F	ALI	Hey_. This is your club and you can be as rude as you want--but don't you dare tell me I'm not serious. Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I may not have been to a professional dance school, but I have a lot of talent and I came to this town to do something with it. And the only reason I've been putting up with all the bullshit "attitude" I get from you is cause I want to do it here. For the first time in my life, I don't want to be someplace else. So you're gonna give me MY shot. Right here. Right now. Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess One song. You don't like it, I'll quit and do us both a favor. Your call, lady. I know every number in the show. Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back You know every number.
F	ALI	Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her in disbelief.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I said, which one do you wanna see? Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to
F	TESS	Tough Lover! Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Okay then, next?
F	ALI	Hang on. Start it again, please? As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage-- What the hell's going on?
F	COCO	Shhhh. On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.
F	ALI	Anytime. The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive. At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms - As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.
F	NIKKI	What are so you happy about, that's your replacement.
F	GEORGIA	Yeah, but she's really good. Tess and Ali are in a stare down.
F	TESS	I want so badly to say something bitchy, but nothing's coming.
M	SEAN	There's a first. Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.
F	TESS	You were off the whole second half.
F	ALI	So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.
F	TESS	Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in my ass. Ali tries hard not to beam--
F	ALI	Do I have the job, or not?
F	TESS	You're not great. What you are is lucky. Because I need someone tonight.
F	ALI	And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves--
F	TESS	Even in those shoes that time forgot.
M	SEAN	Theeeere's bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot.
F	NIKKI	Well-- this totally sucks ass. Sean jumps up on the stage.
M	SEAN	Congratulations. The last time someone showed Tess balls like that, she married him. You look like a checker at a Mal Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your salary. Get a new look.
F	ALI	Hey, I happen to like the way I look.
M	SEAN	Really? That's a fascinating story. And then what happens? Backstage in five. Welcome to the family. Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still
F	ALI	Sorry for the short notice, I quit! But hey-- with my raise I'll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him
M	SEAN	First number, second number, third number... She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them,
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	With the sequined bustier. With the shorts and garters. With the beaded number. And those -- I never want to see again. Oh! And -- He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	For "Miss Otis Regrets". Just be sure you don't -- Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM -- GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	Pull the trigger. - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, yet another set of costumes. - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, another set of costumes. Ali
M	SEAN	Admit it. You like her. It kills you, but you like her. Tess meets his eye, then walks away. The number ends. The
F	ALI	My tits are up around my ears, my thong's about a mile up up ass, this corset is so tight, I haven't breathed since Tuesday and these lashes are thick enough to kick up a stiff wind.
M	SEAN	It's fun being a girl, huh? Yeah. She hands him the last bits of her costume.
F	JESSE	I'm starving, who wants to go grab some pizza before the next show? A general chorus of "Yeah?" and "I'm in." She sees a picture of A CLASSIC BURLESQUE BEAUTY taped to the
M	TESS (O.S.)	Your brush is for shit. She turns and sees Tess in the doorway. Tess comes over,
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Where'd you get this, the 99 cent store? She chucks it in the trash.
F	ALI	Hey.
F	TESS	Make-up is like wine. The good stuff costs a fortune but is worth every penny. Where is everyone?
F	ALI	All the girls went out for pizza.
F	TESS	Aren't you one of the girls?
F	ALI	Apparently not. Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns
F	TESS	Don't take it personally. Their love's the kind you gotta earn. Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a brush
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Dip it in water first, or you'll never get a clean line. She leaves Ali alone.
M	JACK	Your stupid cat peed in the tub!
F	ALI	What...? You closed the window, what do you expect?
M	JACK	Your cat pees in the house, and it's my_ fault?! Ali scoops the cat up.
F	ALI	Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been desperate.
M	JACK	Goddamn cat. And you used my towel again. How's that apartment hunting coming? He GRABS the newspaper and tosses it in front of her-- she A thousand bucks for a studio?
M	JACK	Can you really put a price on privacy? Freedom? Your own bathroom? With clean towels?
F	ALI	Okay, Jack-- I get it-- His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling:
M	JACK	Natalie. Hey, baby, how are you? He heads into the bedroom, closes the door. Ali shakes her
F	ALI	Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with a yard, and -- oh. No pets. Screw them. She scans the ads some more. Finds a good one.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Ooh? Jack walks in. Looks like he's got something on his mind.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I think I found my new place. Where's Pomona?
M	JACK	Go to Hell, turn left, it's three miles down on the right.
F	ALI	Really. How's Beachwood Canyon?
M	JACK	Great, if you have a car. Truth is, you should get a car first. This is L.A. You don't exist without a car. Plus, you can't really afford a decent place yet. Tell you what. I'm gonna suck it up and let you stay here a little longer. Just throw in a little something for rent. She looks at him, curious.
F	ALI	What about the "God damn" cat?
M	JACK	Hey, I don't like the cat. And I don't like my towel being wet. I don't like the lack of privacy. But you're in a jam -- and I'm the kind of guy, if a friend's in trouble, I help. It's just who I am. What did Natalie have to say?
M	JACK	Nothing, you know just... hi. She narrows her eyes at him. He concedes.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	And...her play got extended three more months, so since she has to pay rent there, she can't also keep up her part of the rent here.
F	ALI	Ah-hah.
M	JACK	So if you could stick around and chip in, it would --
F	ALI	Save your ass?
M	JACK	-- help. Ali looks down at his shoes.
F	ALI	Well, will you look at that? The shoe, on the other foot!
F	ALI	One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and
M	JACK	Just -- yes or no?
F	ALI	What's the proposal, exactly? Jack looks at her-- realizes he's screwed.
M	JACK	The bedroom, with private bathroom access, for 600 a month, including utilities.
F	ALI	Closet?
M	JACK	Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad.
F	ALI	Ooh, look! Hot tub!
M	JACK	Fine. The closet, too. She weighs it. Makes him suffer. Then:
F	ALI	Okay.
M	JACK	Thank you. Hey, I'm the kind of girl, if a friend's in trouble, I help. That's just who I am. We HEAR an AUDIENCE laugh O.S. as we... So I said to the sailor, I may not be as good as I once was...
F	TESS	But you can bet your sweet ass I'm better ONCE than I ever was... The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn't laughing.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Drink up, sister! You're a tad behind. Be a dear and bring Mommy over there another scotch. The crowd chuckles as the Bumper Band kicks in and the harem
M	SEAN	The distributor's holding back the booze unless we cut him a check.
F	TESS	Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett over to flirt, and try to finagle him down to a half.
M	SEAN	How's a third? He produces a check, all filled-out, for her to sign.
F	TESS	Have I told you lately that I love you?
M	SEAN	Got any brothers? He bustles off with the check. Scarlett, Coco and Nikki
F	TESS	Drinking already?
F	NIKKI	Yes, Mommie.
F	TESS	You're drunk.
F	NIKKI	No. But I'm working on it. Nikki totters a little. Tess looks her over.
F	TESS	I'm pulling you from this number. Go home, wring yourself out, and come back tomorrow.
F	NIKKI	You can't pull me-- Tess SPOTS Ali heading for the dressing room--
F	TESS	Ali! Take Nikki's spot.
F	NIKKI	WHAT?! That bitch can't dance my part!
F	TESS	Ali-- get dressed NOW! Ali looks at Nikki-- who GLARES at her--
F	ALI	But, wait-- Tess-- that's always been Nikki's number. Tess looks at her-- she's really had it with these girls--
F	TESS	But this is MY club, and now it's your number. Ali looks between the two of them, Nikki glaring at her-- Is there a problem? You said you know the whole show. You can do anything, right? Tess just looks at Ali. Nikki stares at Tess, livid, then
M	THE STAGE	Ali and the other dancers hit the stage and start in on the AT THE BAR, Jack is busy mixing drinks. He glances at the
F	NIKKI	Tess needs you. She said it was urgent.
M	DAVE	I can't leave here now --
F	NIKKI	Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you...
M	DAVE	Shit, okay -- He checks his sound board -- then bolts from the room. Nikki
M	DAVE	You wanted to see me? ON STAGE -- Ali looks at flustered Tess...the girls...the On the floor, Nikki watches with satisfaction as she makes She looks around. Silence. Mouths agape. Tess approaches in
F	TESS	Close the Goddman curtain!
M	SEAN	Hold on... Ali starts to sing again, her version, slow, and sexy... Tess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather. Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages The girls come alive, finally able to sing a song they've The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a-
F	ALI	Tess, when the music stopped--
M	TESS DAVE	Why didn't you tell me you I have no idea what happened. could blow like that? I did. Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the door.
F	TESS	Do you boys know all the music?
M	TATTOOED BAND GUY	Hell, yeah. Nikki wanders in, drink in hand. Tess looks at them all.
F	TESS	Okay, then. Tomorrow night, Ali sings lead, everyone else is back- up. Questions? Ali can't keep from beaming as she shakes her head, no!
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Good. The Girls file into the dressing room. Tess heads out, past
F	NIKKI	"People don't come to hear us sing."
F	TESS	No. But they'll come to hear her sing. Dry out and maybe you can back her up. She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs Ali.
M	SEAN	Bitch, you SANG that damn song! He heads off to the dressing room, too, leaving Nikki and Ali
F	NIKKI	One of us has clearly underestimated the other. She tosses her glass in the trash and leaves Ali alone.
F	MARCUS	Where'd you learn to sing like that? She turns. Marcus is there. Handsome, charming and devious as
F	ALI	You can't learn to sing like that.
F	MARCUS	Well, you're too good to be singing here.
F	ALI	I just got into the show and suddenly I'm too good for it? Shrugs, "but, you are" then--
F	MARCUS	How about a drink?
F	ALI	Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I sent you. It's on me.
F	MARCUS	But I hate lines. AT THE BAR - Jack looks up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking.
M	MARCUS (CONT'D)	Seriously. You sound even better than you look. Which is saying a lot.
F	ALI	Talk about a "line." She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar.
F	TESS	What did he want?
F	ALI	Directions to the bar. As Ali heads off. Tess glances back at Marcus, mistrustful.
M	JACK	You blew me away! Who knew you could sing like that?
F	COCO	Who knew any white chick could sing like that? You channeled that shit.
M	SEAN	How the hell do you do that, girl?
F	ALI	I don't know, I can't explain it. It's like -- I start singing, and something starts to move inside me. It's in my hands, my feet, my gut,
M	MY THIGHS	She runs her hands over her body as she describes it. Jack
M	ALI (CONT'D)	and it just builds and builds till I feel like I'm gonna explode.
F	GEORGIA	Trust me, I know what that feels like. I have to pee. Again. She hops off the stool and scurries to the back. Coco
F	COCO	Wanna grab something to eat? Ali looks back at Coco -- validated. Accepted. At last.
F	ALI	Yeah. Lemme get my bag. Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack
M	SEAN	Well, will you look at that.
M	JACK	What?
M	SEAN	You looking at that girl the way I looked at you all those years. Only difference: you actually stand a chance with her.
M	JACK	I have a fiancee.
M	SEAN	Three thousand miles away.
M	JACK	We talk every day.
M	SEAN	Let me guess what about: her, her and...oh! Her. Jack shoots him a glare.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	All I'm saying is, this one's beautiful on the inside too. And she won't be on the shelf forever. Ali comes back, ready to go. Feels them stop talking and
F	ALI	What?
M	SEAN	I was just explaining to Jack that even opportunity has a shelf life. Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back. Sean looks at
F	ALI	Where have I been all my life? Ali finishes the song to big applause. Takes her bow. Makes
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Hiya, big boy. She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all
M	ALI (CONT'D)	What do you think? It's...I think-you look...I mean, yeah... do you like it? Not the reaction she was looking for.
F	ALI	Jack. It's okay for you to think I look hot. We're friends for chrissakes. It's not like we're brother and sister. She rolls her eyes, gets up, and heads backstage. Jack No. We certainly are not.
F	NIKKI	Why the hell is everyone having a conniption over her? She's just a tacky, pushy girl from a -- Ali -- sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous -- enters.
M	NIKKI (CONT'D)	-- fly-over state. Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The What's a fly-over state? Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then
F	TESS	Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no.
M	VINCE	Which made Marcus bump his offer up again. It's obscene, what he wants to give us. At least hear him out.
F	MARCUS	It's very simple. I buy you out and pay you a million off the top. Five hundred grand each. Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.
F	TESS	Why do you want this club so badly?
F	MARCUS	Best view on the Sunset Strip.
M	VINCE	Do you know what you could do with that money, Tess?
F	TESS	Do you know what you can do with that money, Vince?
M	VINCE	Be reasonable. We're rolling vendors ninety days out.
F	MARCUS	The club's not even worth what you paid for it. You've got a second mortgage, you can't get a third. Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.
F	TESS	Did you also tell him about the tattoo on my ass?
M	VINCE	It's business, Tess. Not personal.
F	TESS	My business. Which I built from the ground up.
F	MARCUS	You're not gonna get another opportunity like this.
F	TESS	Exactly. She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Which is why I'll never let it go. She gets up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus
M	VINCE	Don't worry. The balloon payment's due on the first. She doesn't have the money. She has to sell. IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.
M	SEAN	Well. We've had a pretty good run. She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it up. Let it go. Call it a day. Tess's eyes go steely with determination.
F	TESS	No. You cannot say that to me. I can eat these "sky is falling" dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be that person. I've scoured dirty flea markets for costumes, stayed up all night sewing till my fingers bled, painted and repainted every goddamn wall of this place myself.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	I choreographed every step of every number. I've played nursemaid, sister, mother and shrink to every girl who's ever danced here. I've hocked every keepsake I've ever owned to keep this place afloat. Because this club is the last of it's kind, and if it goes away, one day there won't be anything like it- - and THAT would be a tragedy. So you cannot say that to me. Because now someone's gotta believe in me, Goddamnit. And I need that person to be you. So don't you ever let me hear you say that again. I will never let this club go. Never. Sean looks at her...a wry smile.
M	SEAN	There she is. Thought I'd lost you for a minute. Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	Night, Jack.
M	JACK	Night. Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of
F	ALI	Beautiful. You write that?
M	JACK	Just some sentimental crap. Ready? She smiles at his modesty. Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her
F	ALI	Jack? Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.
M	JACK	Hey! Just got home! Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.
F	ALI	In here! Can you zip me up? In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Hey. Where you been?
M	JACK	Rehearsing. I'm playing a late show tonight. As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Who is that? She picks up the picture. Looks at it.
F	ALI	Me and my mom on my 7th birthday. She died just a few weeks later.
M	JACK	She was so young.
F	ALI	24. There was so much she never got to do. Sometimes I feel like, if I make the most of my life, part of her will get to live a little more, too.
M	JACK	Wow. You must miss her. She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.
F	ALI	Every single day, something happens I want to tell her about.
M	JACK	What was today's? A beat. Their eyes connect.
F	ALI	Don't know. Hasn't happened yet. They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from
M	JACK	I should... it's... Natalie. Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Hey, babe, how are you? Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Yes, she's still here-What do you want me to do, it's not like you're here helping out, you know... Ali grabs her bag and jacket, heads for the door. PULL BACK to reveal she's on stage at the club with the AT THE BAR, Jack watches as he pours drinks. PULL BACK to reveal A PACKED HOUSE. The audience goes nuts.
F	ALI	Hey -- when can you cut out? I'm about to fall asleep standing up.
M	JACK	I have that gig, remember? In fact, I gotta head out or I'm gonna be late. I can maybe swing you home before.
F	ALI	No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab a ride with Coco. He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out:
M	JACK	By the way -- you killed.
F	ALI	Thanks. He disappears out the back exit. Ali turns around and finds
F	MARCUS	You ready?
F	ALI	For what?
F	MARCUS	I'll drop you off. Coco left five minutes ago. She realizes he was listening to her conversation.
F	ALI	Excuse me?
F	MARCUS	Sorry-- I was coming to talk to you and caught the end of your conversation.
F	ALI	Talk to me about...?
F	MARCUS	Dinner. With me. Gimmie that. He swoops down and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and If you ever expect to see this bag alive again... you'll come with me.
F	ALI	Hey...! Come back here...!
F	ALI	Where are you taking me?
F	MARCUS	I told you-- to dinner.
F	ALI	Dinner? What about Nikki-- What's up with you and Nikki?
F	MARCUS	We're friends.
F	ALI	Where I'm from friends don't chew each other's earlobes.
F	MARCUS	Aren't you glad you left? Oh, damn!
F	ALI	What?
F	MARCUS	I just remembered I have to make a quick appearance at a party.
F	ALI	You just remembered.
F	MARCUS	It's on the way. We'll be quick. Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?
F	ALI	And if I do.
F	MARCUS	Then you've been kidnapped. He turns off Sunset and heads up into the hills.
F	ALI	Wow. Nice house.
M	PARTY GUEST	Hey, Marcus --
F	MARCUS	Hey, how you doing? He shakes the guy's hand and moves on through the party.
M	ANOTHER GUEST	Marcus!
F	MARCUS	Hey, let me get a drink, I'll be Marcus pulls Ali in the opposite direction, avoiding another
F	ALI	Marcus -- you can't just take that. He hands her one tray, sticks a bottle of wine in one pocket,
F	ALI	They're gonna throw us out of here.
F	MARCUS	Not if we sneak out first, come on. He kicks open a back door.
F	MARCUS	Up there. He starts up some steps to an outdoor gazebo. Ali follows.
M	GUY	Hey, Marcus --
F	MARCUS	Hey, Guys. Greg, Marla, this is Ali. They exchange hellos. Ali notices:
F	ALI	Ooh. Killer shoes.
F	MARLA	Aren't they? Louboutins. Great party, as always.
F	MARCUS	Glad you could come. Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps
M	AL I	You had to make an appearance at your own party?
F	MARCUS	Would've been rude not to, right? You'd like those guys. Greg's the entertainment editor at the Times, and Marla's a designer. Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.
M	AL I	I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
F	MARCUS	Thousand dollars a pop.
M	AL I	Jesus. Who can afford that?
F	MARCUS	I can.
F	ALI	Hey, I saw them first. He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot prettier from up here.
F	MARCUS	It should. That view cost me three times what the house did. See that strip mall down there?
F	ALI	You own that too?
F	MARCUS	No. I own everything above it.
F	ALI	There is nothing above it.
F	MARCUS	Exactly.
F	ALI	You own...air?
F	MARCUS	Air rights. The guy who owns the strip mall was having money issues and almost had to sell. Whoever he sold to would have put in a huge tower. So I bought the air rights. Now no one can ever build above one story.
F	ALI	Aren't you the sly puss.
F	MARCUS	Mall guy gets to keep his property. I get to keep the second best view in L.A.
F	ALI	What's the first? He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	How many girls have you used that on?
F	MARCUS	None who ever called me on it. He smiles. Looks at her. Then...
M	MARCUS (CONT'D)	What do you want, Ali? In life. Girl like you, gives up everything, gets on a bus heading for total uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I want to know what it is.
F	ALI	Why?
F	MARCUS	Because you're talented enough to get whatever you want. And I'm smart enough to help make it happen. So? What do you want? A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.
F	ALI	I want to be the best singer I can be. I want to give as much joy as I get when I perform. And I want to die knowing I made the most of every opportunity life gave me.
F	MARCUS	That's ...so beautiful.
M	AL I	There wasn't a dry eye in the house when I said it at the Grundy County Junior Miss Talent Show. His eyes narrow.
F	MARCUS	Why do you women always take advantage of nice boys?
F	ALI	Oh, please. You are SO not a nice boy. He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy.
F	ALI	Ooh, I love this song. The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He
M	JACK	Ali? He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock: 4:45. He hears a
F	COCO	Someone has a package! Ali sees A GIFT BOX at her station. She reads the card: "You
F	JESSE	Ooh. Faboo. Nikki picks one up -- checking their authenticity.
F	NIKKI	Who's the sucker? All eyes turn to Ali. She's saved by Tess entering.
F	TESS	Coco-puff, shake a leg, you're on in five, Georgie-Girl, Ali-Cat -- move, move, move -- Tess exits.
F	ALI	Ahh. My Nanna used to call me her Ali-Cat.
M	SEAN	Yet another fascinating story.
F	NIKKI	Why doesn't Tess have a nickname for me?
F	COCO	Oh, she does. A knowing look amongst the girls.
F	NIKKI	She never uses it.
M	SEAN	Sure she does.
F	NIKKI	When?
M	SEAN	Just after you leave the room. Nikki gives him the finger and walks out. A beat. Then:
M	GIRLS TOGETHER	Coke-whore. They crack up. CUE MUSIC: "STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING"
M	JACK	You were out late last night.
F	ALI	I got a ride home with that guy-- Marcus-- we went to a party. It was fun.
M	JACK	Marcus the Asshole?
F	ALI	Yeah. Turns out he's not so bad. She heads past him, toward the kitchen. He notices:
M	JACK	New shoes? All the Bartenders sing, except Jack, who keeps his eyes on
M	JACK	There's only one reason a man buys a woman shoes, you know.
F	ALI	So what if I'm getting a little male attention.
M	JACK	You get a lot more than a little.
F	ALI	Not from anyone who matters. I just think that you should be careful. Ali stops in front of him. Hands on her hips.
M	AL I	And I just think that -- if you really feel the need to tell a girl what she should and shouldn't do, you should pick up the phone and call your fiancee. AT THEIR TABLE, Greg leans into Marcus and whispers After she passes... Jack's eyes open.
M	JACK	Hey. Have you seen this?
F	ALI	What? Ali wanders out of the bathroom, brushing her teeth. He
F	NIKKI	That's bullshit.
F	SCARLETT	No. That's major.
F	NIKKI	Look again. The only thing major is the size of your ass. Nikki walks off-- Scarlett pick up the paper, looks closer--
F	COCO	From Monsieur Louboutin, I presume. Ali reads the card: "To the best view in L.A. - M". Sean
M	SEAN	Shake your tail, Alicat, you still got a show to do. Tess, all dolled-up, weaves through the tables, greeting,
F	MARCUS	To the girl of the hour.
F	ALI	I'm starting to think you'll go to any length. I just made a call to Greg at the Times.
F	ALI	Well-- I appreciate the kudos. And Tess appreciates the business.
F	MARCUS	This has NOTHING to do with Tess. This is about you. And me.
F	ALI	You are so full of it. He laughs-- takes her arm--
F	MARCUS	I've got another friend I want you to meet. She sees HAROLD SAINT sitting in the booth. He's in his
M	MARCUS (CONT'D)	Ali Rose, Harold Saint. Harold Saint? Shut up. You worked with Etta James.
M	HAROLD	Her, she chewed me up and spat me out, that one. But with her voice, I forgive her everything. You got a set of pipes on you, too, little girl. I like your sound.
F	ALI	Thank you. I like yours.
M	HAROLD	You ever recorded?
F	ALI	Not yet.
M	HAROLD	We should do something about that. He stands. Turns to Marcus.
M	HAROLD (CONT'D)	See you round, kiddo. He points his finger, gun-style, which would seem cheesy, but
F	ALI	Holy shit. Harold Saint. AT THE BAR, Jack watches Ali and Marcus talking excitedly.
M	SEAN	You snooze, you lose, pretty boy.
F	TESS	Can you believe this crowd? He dumps the costumes in her arms.
M	SEAN	'bout time. These poor babies are begging for your glue-gun. Tess walks off with the armful of clothes, so happy, humming
F	TESS	Can you believe the crowd out there? Never thought I'd see- She stops in her tracks, spotting Vince's PANTS on the FLOOR, THE NEW COCKTAIL WAITRESS, peering out, half-dressed, from In my god damn office? She shakes her head-- GRABS HER PURSE-- and walks out.
F	NIKKI	Tess. We need to talk. Tess rolls her eyes, doesn't slow.
F	TESS	Not now, Nikki.
F	NIKKI	Yes, now. I've been here since the beginning. We built this club together. And then some girl shows up out of nowhere-- who hasn't even paid her dues--
F	TESS	I'll get her to write a check tomorrow.
F	NIKKI	And suddenly it's her show?
F	TESS	No, it's not her show. It's my show. But people want to hear her sing. She's bringing them in off the streets. You better believe I'm building a show around her!
F	NIKKI	I can sing too! And you know it. But you don't give a shit. You always say this is a dance troupe, now suddenly it's not?
F	NIKKI	And you expect me to dance behind a girl who struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with Marcus Gerber?
F	TESS	Nikki, you're wasted. Go home.
F	NIKKI	I won't be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs! Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious.
F	TESS	So don't be! Leave! If you don't want to be a part of what's happening here, then I don't want you around. You'd destroy our friendship and break up the group over some girl you barely know?
F	TESS	Since when do you care about friendship? Or this group? You're a trainwreck, Nikki! You put tequila on your breakfast cereal! I'm struggling to survive here, and you show up too drunk to dance! You call that loyalty? Nikki just looks at her--
F	NIKKI	Okay, then. I quit! Nikki stomps off. Tess sighs --
F	NIKKI	Marcus says you're losing the club anyway! "They don't come to hear us sing" Stupid bitch. Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns once more: By the way: I slept with Vince the day after your honeymoon. Tess's eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and HURLS
M	NIKKI (CONT'D)	You crazy bitch! Nikki screeches off, leaving Tess alone in the parking lot.
M	DAVE (O.S.)	Night, Tess. Tess looks up, Dave is closing up the sound booth.
F	TESS	Night, Dave. Dave FLIPS a big lever, and almost all the lights go OUT, JACK, asleep in the bed. Ali looks at him, then looks at the You really need to do that at 6 in the morning? He turns, sees her.
M	JACK	Little overdressed for breakfast.
F	ALI	My pajamas were in my bedroom. Which was occupied.
M	JACK	Well, you're never here so... it's stupid for me to crash on the couch every night when there's a perfectly good empty bed. Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces.
F	ALI	So -- you want the bedroom back? Is that what you're saying?
M	JACK	The bed should be used by someone.
F	ALI	Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe not when you think I should be, but last I checked, you were my roommate, not my mother. However, since it's an issue, what the hell, take the bed, I'll sleep on the sofa. I don't care.
M	JACK	Fine.
F	ALI	Fine.
M	JACK	You'll have to move all your shit.
F	ALI	I realize that.
M	JACK	Cause the room's a total mess --
F	ALI	I'll move my stuff, God --
M	JACK	Clothes, make-up, shoes, hair things.
F	ALI	Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I started hanging out with Marcus, you've been acting like a class-A prick. Is there something you want to say?
M	JACK	What? No. What do I care? You're ambitious, he can make things happen, go ahead, make a deal with the devil, what's it to me?
F	ALI	First of all: He's not the devil. He's a smart businessman. And oddly enough-- a gentleman. Second: I'm gonna take the couch, and you're gonna 86 the attitude. Or I'm finding another place to live. She storms out of the kitchen, tripping over the cat-- a LOUD
M	JACK	And try not to kill the cat! A SLAM of the bedroom door. MUSIC UP: INSTRUMENTAL to "BABY
M	JACK	What do you mean, you're still in New York? ...So you just -- decided not to come? You think you might've wanted to, I don't know, let me know??? We haven't seen each other in six months. ACROSS THE TERRACE, Ali sees Jack yelling into his phone.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	.why does every conversation we have end up being about YOUR future... Jack looks across the terrace at Ali. Moonlight on her
M	JACK (CONT'D)	.you know what, you're right. We both should be thinking about our futures. And I might just be looking at mine right now. Break a leg baby. Jack hangs up with finality and marches toward the bar-- His He sees it's Natalie, sends it to voicemail, and shuts off
M	JACK (CONT'D)	I guess Natalie's not coming after all.
M	SEAN	Oh, please, that girl? Show up at a party where she's not the center of attention? AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack drains one drink and orders Shot of Patron. Jack raises his brow. Ali drinks the shot, and without
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Lookin' kinda lonely. No. Not lonely. Liberated, yes. Libated, absolutely. But never lonely. Cheers, baby-- He raises his glass-- she rolls her eyes, walks off-- he
F	ALI	Hey-- what're we, in junior high?
M	JACK	You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon. Bring it on. She starts to say something as-- THE SHIRELLES start to sing Everyone stares at the drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and
M	JACK (CONT'D)	.Many many many nights go by, I sit alone, at home and cry, over you...
F	ALI	Well, you're quite the crooner. He looks her in the eye.
M	JACK	I'm sorry for being a class A prick. Ali smiles, surprised at his candor. He breathes a sigh of And as of about... .some time ago, I am officially a single man.
F	ALI	You and Natalie split up?
M	JACK	That we did. So. That explains what I'm doing here all alone. What are you doing here all alone?
F	ALI	Do I look alone to you? They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is
F	COCO	That DJ's hot.
M	SEAN	You think?
F	COCO	He keeps looking at me. Coco smiles up at him, flirty. The DJ smiles back. Hmmm...I think he's cuckoo for Coco- puffs. They look at each other, then crack up like giggling
M	ALI (O.C.)	Whoopsie daisy -- PULL BACK to find Jack and Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on
M	JACK	Whoopsie daisy?
F	ALI	My Nanna used to say that all the time. That and upsie jumpsie.
M	JACK	Upsie jumpsie? Upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy, upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy, upsie jumpsie -- When would she say that?
F	ALI	When she wanted her dog to get on the bed with her. That is -- when she was alive. Their eyes meet. A connection. Then, staring into her eyes:
M	JACK	The dog, or Nanna? Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door
F	ALI	Help me. Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's
M	JACK	Stay. He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Good night. He backs away, into the bedroom. Ali looks confused.
F	ALI	Oh. Okay. Good night. Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door. Ali
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Cute jammies.
M	JACK	A gift from my mother. Never worn them.
F	ALI	Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the door.
M	JACK	Forgot to lock up. Okay. Night.
F	ALI	Night again. He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door.
M	JACK	Water. No hangover. He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Night. Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Hungry. He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal, I know I forgot something else, but I just can't remember what... Door locked, water, food... He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from
M	JACK (CONT'D)	What's so funny? She covers her face. He glances down.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Well I never! He strides back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a I remembered what I forgot to do.
F	ALI	What? Kiss you goodnight. He crosses to her, takes her in his arms, and kisses her. Jack and Ali in bed, in post-coital bliss.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Well, it's official.
M	JACK	What?
F	ALI	You are definitely not gay. He smiles at her, drunk with lust. CAMERA PANS UP AND OFF OF Ali on stage, lights blasting. Ali and Jack in bed, in different positions, wrapped in
M	JACK	I've been wanting to do this since you first walked in the club. She cocks an eyebrow at him.
F	ALI	Sure got a funny way of showing it. He smiles at her.
M	JACK	I'll show you an even funnier way -- you ready? He disappears under the sheets. She SQUEALS, starts laughing Ali, on stage, belting: Jack in bed, sitting against the headboard, wearing only a
M	ALI (CONT'D)	So, what about Natalie...?
M	JACK	Natalie who? Ali smiles. Rolls the stocking up over her shapely thigh, Do it again. She giggles, repeats the sexy act for him. CAMERA PANS UP AND Ali on stage, the big finish: Jack bolts up in bed. Stares.
M	JACK	Natalie! Ali blinks awake. Confused.
F	ALI	Natalie? Jack scrambles for something to put on.
F	NATALIE	YOU are a LIAR. You're a sneaky, pathetic LI-AR!
F	ALI	What 's she doing here:
M	JACK	I don't know!
F	NATALIE	I LIVE HERE, you bleached out tramp, what the hell are YOU doing here?!! You were engaged to this woman?
M	JACK	Nat, can we talk about this in the living room --
F	NATALIE	I can't BELIEVE I bought your bullshit: "It's nothing, she's just this chick from work, she's nothing." That's what he called you. "Nothing. She's not even pretty. Well, at least you were honest about one thing--
M	ALI JACK	You said that? No, I didn't --
M	NATALIE (CONT'D) JACK	He most certainly did! Nat-- shut the fu--
M	ALI NATALIE	Jack?!? Don't even say his name! As Ali grabs for a shirt--
M	JACK	Listen, Ali-- let me just-- would you mind --
F	ALI	What?!?
M	JACK	Giving us a little privacy? You want me to leave?
F	NATALIE	Yes you! I'm the fiancee. You're a booty call. You go.
M	JACK	Natalie, Jesus, STOP IT! Ali grabs some pants from the floor, pulls them on.
F	ALI	Fine, I'm out of here-- You said you split up!
F	NATALIE	In one phone call? Please, you don't dump a girl like me on the phone.
M	JACK	Both of you-- STOP IT! As Ali quickly grabs a few things-- Ali-- I'm really sorry-- I--
F	ALI	So am I. She gathers up more things, really pissed--
M	JACK	Wait-- do you need money for a Motel or... Ali stifles him with an incredulous glare-- can't believe how
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Ali, wait a second-- don't-- --go. Shit. Jack looks at Natalie. She folds her arms.
F	ALI	Oh. I'm sorry. I think I have the wrong apartment. I'm looking for Sean? Brown hair? 5'10n? Early 30's?
M	DJ	Oh, Sean! I thought he said John. He's asleep. Come in. The DJ shuffles inside. Ali follows as he leads her to the
M	DJ (CONT'D)	That him? Ali nods. Sean's eyes pop open, confused to see her.
M	SEAN	What are you doing here?
F	ALI	Long story. Sean notices the guy in the blanket.
M	SEAN	Ali, this is Mike.
M	DJ	Mark.
M	SEAN	Mark??? Oh. Anyone want coffee?
F	ALI	I'll make it. You two get acquainted.
M	MARCUS (OVER PHONE)	Hey gorgeous.
F	ALI	Oh. Marcus. Is the coffee ready?
M	MARCUS (OVER PHONE)	Who's that?
F	ALI	Mark. Or Mike. Jury's still out.
M	MARCUS (OVER PHONE)	Should I be jealous?
F	ALI	Only if you had your eye on Sean.
M	MARCUS (OVER PHONE)	You okay? You sound down.
F	ALI	Mmm. Maybe a little.
M	MARCUS (OVER PHONE)	I know just the cure.
F	ALI	What's that?
M	MARCUS (OVER PHONE)	Me. But you turned me down. She thinks for a moment. Then:
F	ALI	Haven't you heard? No is the new yes. NATALIE'S HEELS storm away from the apartment. Carrying her The girls continue the number. Post modern Gaultier bondage
M	SEAN	Well. Bye.
M	MARK	You... Take care. Sean. Mark turns, heads down the stairs as Jack rushes up, calling:
M	JACK	Is Ali here?
M	MARK	Just left. Mark continues down. Jack whips around, looks at him, then up
M	JACK	Where'd she go?
M	SEAN	With Marcus.
M	JACK	What?
M	SEAN	I told you, opportunity doesn't knock forever. Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs. Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	Hey! You! It's Mark.
M	SEAN	Mark. You wanna have breakfast? Off Mark's smile:
F	MARCUS	My mother always said there's only one thing to do when you're feeling blue... He opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of CHAMPAGNE.
F	ALI	She was a poet.
F	MARCUS	And a drunk. Ali smiles. Marcus pops the cork, fills two glasses, hands To your new place.
F	ALI	What new place?
F	MARCUS	All yours. Unpack. Move in.
F	ALI	Marcus, I can't just--
F	MARCUS	Sure you can. Marcus plops her suitcase on the bed.
M	MARCUS (CONT'D)	Unpack. You're home.
F	ALI	It's not even on the bus route.
F	MARCUS	Okay, that is the first and last time the term "bus route" will be spoken in this house. Four cars. Which do you want?
F	MARCUS	Better? Better. She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level.
F	MARCUS	You're gonna be on one of those someday.
F	ALI	Yeah, right.
F	MARCUS	Sooner than you think, too. Harold Saint called me today. You made quite an impression on him.
F	ALI	Really? What'd he say?
F	MARCUS	He wants to make a demo with you.
F	ALI	Are you serious? When??
F	MARCUS	He found a little studio time on Tuesday.
F	ALI	This Tuesday?
F	MARCUS	Too soon?
F	ALI	No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing. You're amazing.
F	MARCUS	I like making you happy. Your whole face lights up. Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face.
F	ALI	I think you're way too nice to me.
F	MARCUS	And that's a problem because...
F	ALI	I've had a lot to drink. And my judgment is off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable.
F	MARCUS	Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means I'd never kiss a lady when she's... vulnerable. She looks at him.
F	ALI	Liar. She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss.
F	ALI	Where am I? She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Who am I? She sees her and Marcus's clothes in a trail on the floor and
F	MARCUS	Morning. He comes up behind her, nuzzles her neck.
F	ALI	What is this?
F	MARCUS	Now it's a model. But when it grows up, it'll be a mixed-use space: retail and residential.
F	ALI	This is the address of the Burlesque Lounge. Marcus shrugs, dries his hair.
F	MARCUS	Best view on the Sunset Strip, with no windows. When I'm done with it, it'll have a thousand.
F	ALI	You can't tear down the club.
F	MARCUS	Actually, I can.
F	ALI	But what about the history? That place is a landmark.
F	MARCUS	Not according to the city.
F	ALI	Does Tess know about this?
F	MARCUS	What Tess knows and doesn't know isn't a big concern of mine.
F	ALI	What makes you think she would ever sell the Lounge?
F	MARCUS	She has no choice. She's going under.
F	ALI	But that club is her life!
F	MARCUS	Oh, come on, you get this. It's business. It's not personal.
F	ALI	Not personal? It's pretty god damn personal for Tess! And Coco and Sean and Alexis. And what about Jesse? And Dave the lighting guy?
F	ALI	And what about me? It's pretty God damn personal to me. She turns to leave.
F	MARCUS	Where are you going?
F	ALI	To the club. Where I work. She marches out of the room, resolute--
F	MARCUS	Ali-- wait!!! At the door she turns back and looks at him. As he starts to The whole club is with him now, as Jack channels Sinatra, Applause, hoots and hollers. Jack high-fives and fist pumps Tess ENTERS. SEES Sean is at the bar. He looks up--
M	SEAN	How'd it go? Oh, shit. She grabs a bottle of Tequila and a glass, turns to walk off.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	What are you gonna do?
F	TESS	Right now? Get really drunk. THE FRONT DOORS OPEN, and Ali ENTERS, spots Tess, rushes over
F	ALI	Tess! I have to talk to you! Tess keeps walking.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Marcus Gerber is trying to buy the lounge, and he's gonna tear it down and build a twenty-story skyscraper! Tess stops. Slowly turns and stares at Ali, who's suddenly
M	ALI (CONT'D)	I just saw the plans. Tess looks at Ali. Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless, She has to do something! She can't just let him -- Let it go, girl. She just got turned down for another loan. It's either foreclose, or sell to Marcus.
F	ALI	So that's it? It's over?
M	SEAN	The circle of life, baby. All good things must come to an end.
F	ALI	But she can't just give up!
M	SEAN	She's not giving up. She's going down with her ship. With dignity. Ali sits on a barstool, in disbelief.
M	SEAN (CONT'D)	I've got something for you. He pulls out the photo of Ali with her mother. It's in a new
F	ALI	Where'd you get this?
M	SEAN	Jack. He dropped it off on his way to the airport.
F	ALI	Where's he going?
M	SEAN	New York on the red-eye.
F	ALI	To be with Natalie?
M	SEAN	Pedal faster, baby, he and Natalie are over. You're the one he's been looking high and low for. Really...? Then why's he going to New York?
M	SEAN	Get your ass over to LAX and ask him yourself! Ali nods, jumps up from her stool, and races for the door,
F	ALI	I don't have a -- Sean tosses her his CAR KEYS.
M	SEAN	American to JFK. Go! Ali catches the keys and TAKES OFF.
M	JACK'S VOICE	This is Jack. Leave me a message. FIND Jack on the other side, as his belongings come down the
M	SECURITY GUY	Boarding pass?
M	AL I	I have to talk to someone, he's --
M	SECURITY GUY	No one's allowed past this point without a boarding pass.
F	ALI	But I have to speak to him!
M	SECURITY GUY	I'm sorry, miss.
M	SECURITY GUY	There's Gate 43, right over there. He points. It's the first gate beyond Security. Ali sees ALL HEADS TURN to look at her, except Jack, who can't hear.
M	JACK	What are you doing here?
F	ALI	Sean told me you're going to New York. Please don't go!
M	JACK	I have to. I got an offer from that band -- the Punk Fusion group. They want me to tour with them.
F	ALI	Really?
M	JACK	They finally had it with the flaky keyboardist. I'll be back in five weeks. Will you be here?
F	ALI	Yes! Yes. Absolutely.
M	JACK	What about Marcus?
F	ALI	.Marcus who? They share a smile, separated by the ropes.
M	JACK	I'm trying to figure out if I should kiss you now, or make you wait five weeks.
F	ALI	Five weeks?! That's forever! ANGLE ON: A MALE AND FEMALE SECURITY GUARD, listening to the
M	JACK	I gotta go, that's me. He picks up his bags. It's killing Ali. I'll call you when I get there. Take care of Miles Davis. Our cat. I named him. They smile again. Neither wanting this moment to end. She ON JACK, walking back to the gate-then -- he stops. Turns
M	FEMALE SECURITY GUARD	Boy, you get out there and kiss that girl! Now! Jack looks at her, then quickly turns to walk past the Male
M	MALE SECURITY GUARD	Go ahead-- but you're gonna have to come back through Security again.
M	JACK	But then I'll miss my flight!
M	FEMALE SECURITY GUARD	Martin! Don't you dare keep that boy from kissing his girl! Martin looks at Jack. Then:
M	MALE SECURITY GUARD	Ah, hell. Go ahead. Bag stays here.
M	ALI!	She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically romantic move, Jack looks at Ali.
F	ALI	Well, go get 'em, Jack. He smiles, then disappears into the crowd. Ali stands there,
F	TESS	Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have... .the best view on the Sunset Strip. The audience hoots as the Burlesque Girls ENTER the stage ON ALI-- a lightbulb going on! As Tess exits the stage, Ali
F	ALI	Tess!
F	TESS	You could knock-- this is still my office--at least for another 48
F	ALI	But this is really, really -- Tess holds up a hand.
F	TESS	Not. Now.
F	TESS	I said -- NOT --
F	ALI	Yes now! God damn, you are one stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now, when I have something to tell you, you listen! I told you I could dance, did you listen? No. Big mistake. I told you I could sing, did you listen? No. Big. mistake. This time you are going to hear what I have to say if I have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in your God damn ear. For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a breath.
M	ALI (CONT'D)	Have you ever heard of air rights? Jim -- Jim -- hang on, I'm gonna have to call you back -- Jim! Damnit, Nancy, get him back. Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns to Tess.
M	BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	Back with more noise complaints?
F	TESS	You offered to buy my club a few years back. I said no.
M	BUSINESSMAN	And now you've changed your mind.
F	TESS	Not exactly. Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She
M	BUSINESSMAN	I'm confused.
F	TESS	Go with me, there's a good ending, I promise. How much will these condos you're building sell for?
M	BUSINESSMAN	They start at one million and go up, depending on the view.
F	TESS	What if I told you a twenty-story high-rise was going up where my club is? Would twenty stories block his view?
F	ALI	Ten stories would. Twenty would decimate them. Leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows.
F	TESS	So. Mr. ?
M	BUSINESSMAN	Anderson.
F	TESS	Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million- dollar ocean views are going away because I'm selling my building to a developer tomorrow who'll have his twenty stories all framed up by the time you start selling --
F	ALI	Trying to sell--
F	TESS	Trying to sell these condos. Or. I can put you in a position where your buyers could be guaranteed their million-dollar views forever.
M	BUSINESSMAN	I'm listening.
F	TESS	As am I. As long as you're telling me you'll have a check to me by 5:00 today.
M	COCKTAIL WAITRESS	Sorry, baby, they cut you off at the bar. Said you have to pay cash.
M	VINCE	What? I co-own this goddamn place-- Tess comes up behind him.
F	TESS	Not anymore you don't. I'm buying you out.
M	VINCE	You can't do that.
F	TESS	Actually, according to page 4 of our contract, I can. In the next 48 hours?
F	TESS	Why postpone joy? She hands him a CASHIER'S CHECK. Vince stares at it.
M	VINCE	What the hell is this?
F	TESS	I realize it's been a while since you've seen one, but it's called a check. He stares at it, stunned.Then at her.
M	VINCE	Where'd you get this?
F	TESS	Not your business anymore. And neither is the lounge. I'm sure you know where the door is. It used to be half yours. And take HER with you. Tess turns and goes over to the bar, where Ali spins around
F	ALI	How'd that feel?
F	TESS	Not half bad. Tess parks it next to her. Looks at Ali. Smiles, then breaks
M	TESS (CONT'D)	It felt pretty God damn awesome! And they crack up again. Then...
F	ALI	And to think, you didn't even want me around.
F	TESS	Oh, Jesus, here it comes.
F	ALI	.What was it you said to me that first night? "Twenty bucks at the door will make all your dreams come true." That was sweet of you.
F	TESS	Are you finished?
F	ALI	Kinda ironic, when you think about it. I started off begging you to make my dreams come true, and here we are --
F	TESS	All right already! You want me to say it, I'll say it. She looks at her.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	This place is the love of my life. The only dream I've ever had. I don't know what I would have done if I had lost it. Thank you. A moment between them... as Tess SPOTS NIKKI ENTER the club I crossed the line. Tess crosses her arms, and with a smirk on her face--
F	TESS	Again.
F	NIKKI	Again, and I wanna come home--
F	NIKKI	Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or what...?
F	TESS	What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a look. Curtain's up in 20. Shake a leg. Ali looks at Tess quizzically--
F	ALI	Just like that?
F	TESS	If I had a dollar for every time she's quit...
F	ALI	Really?
F	TESS	We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate. And then make up. Just like sisters.
F	ALI	I never had a sister.
F	TESS	Me neither. THANK GOD.
M	TESS (CONT'D)	Now get your cute little ass and big ole' voice up on stage, cause this is Burlesque, baby girl, where the women are always on top, and the men like it that way. Like I've always said --
M	ALI/TESS	You can't keep a good girl down.
M	BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM	Ali walks into the dressing room. Sits down in front of her All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room. ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror.
