M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes. To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids.
M	KID #1	Hey, Greenbaum!
M	GREENBAUM	Uh oh. It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him?
M	GREENBAUM	W...what?
M	KID #1	My fist in your fuckin' face!
M	GREENBAUM	Why would Jesus want that?
M	KID #2	Get him!
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends.
F	JOHN	Hey guys, can I play?
M	KID #1/#2/#3	Get outta here! / Get outta here, Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!
M	GREENBAUM	Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own. And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came. CONTINUED: All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	And for little John Bennett, Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival.
F	JOHN	Wow!
M	JOHN'S DAD	I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh?
M	JOHN'S MOM	Merry Christmas, John.
F	JOHN	He talks!
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I'm gonna name you Teddy.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	John became instantly attached to Teddy. There was something about that bear that made him feel as if he finally had a friend with whom he could share his deepest secrets.
F	JOHN	Hey Teddy... can I tell you something nobody knows?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic. And they have this duck pond there, and... when nobody was looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck. Was that mean? I love you too, Teddy! You know... I wish you could really talk to me. Because then we could be best friends forever and ever. CONTINUED: Now, if there's one thing you can be sure of... it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish. Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry. An absolute death machine. Well, as it turned out, John picked the perfect night to make a wish. The house and yard are covered with snow.
F	JOHN	Teddy? Teddy?! CONTINUED:
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Teddy?
M	TEDDY	Hug me.
F	JOHN	Did you... did you just talk?
M	TEDDY	You're my best friend, John.
F	JOHN	You're alive?!
M	TEDDY	Uh-huh.
F	JOHN	Whoa...
M	TEDDY	Don't look so surprised. You're the one who wished for it, aren't you?
F	JOHN	Yeah, I... I did wish for it.
M	TEDDY	Well, here I am.
F	JOHN	You mean... we get to be best friends... for real?
M	TEDDY	For real.
F	JOHN	Forever and ever?
M	TEDDY	Sounds good to me.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	John was just about the happiest boy in the world. And he couldn't wait to tell everyone the good news. JOHN'S MOM Well, I think we had a wonderful Christmas this year.
M	JOHN'S DAD	One of the best. And I particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night.
F	JOHN	Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's alive!
M	JOHN'S MOM	Really, sweetie? Well, that's exciting.
F	JOHN	No mom, he's alive! For real! Look!
M	TEDDY	Merry Christmas, everybody!
M	JOHN'S DAD	Jesus H. Fuck!
M	TEDDY	Let's all be best friends!
M	JOHN'S MOM	Oh my god...
M	JOHN'S DAD	John, get away from that thing! Come over here, right now!
F	JOHN	BUT DAD--
M	JOHN'S DAD	GET OVER HERE!
M	JOHN'S DAD (CONT'D)	Helen, get my gun.
F	JOHN	Dad, no!
M	TEDDY	Is it a hugging gun?
M	JOHN'S DAD	Helen, get my gun, and call the police!
M	TEDDY	I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn't mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends.
F	JOHN	Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true!
M	JOHN'S MOM	My god, Steve... it's a miracle. A Christmas miracle.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Well, it wasn't long before the story of John's little miracle was sweeping the nation.
M	NEWSCASTER	Out of a Boston suburb comes what is, without a doubt, the most incredible story in the history of broadcast news... FEMALE NEWSCASTER ...young boy's stuffed animal has magically come to life for as yet unknown reasons. Scientists are stumped as to how...
M	SOUTHERN NEWSCASTER	Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!
M	FEMALE NEWSCASTER	
M	MALE NEWSCASTER	
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Before long, Teddy had become a huge celebrity in his own right.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	But through all the fame, Teddy never forgot his very best friend, John.
M	JOHN (O.S., UNDER COVERS)	The thunder can't get us, right?
M	TEDDY (O.S., UNDER COVERS)	Nope. We're thunder buddies. And the thunder knows it. We're totally safe.
F	JOHN	Teddy?
M	TEDDY	Yeah, John?
F	JOHN	Do you promise we'll always be together?
M	TEDDY	I promise.
M	TEDDY (CONT'D)	Thunder buddies for life.
F	JOHN	Thunder buddies for life. CONTINUED:
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	And that was a promise that neither one of them ever forgot.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	So where are John and Teddy today? Well, let me put it this way: no matter how big a splash you make in this world, whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber, or a talking teddy bear, eventually nobody gives a shit. `Robocop'?" A TV GUIDE COVER SLIDES BY: It shows a smiling Ted with CONTINUED:
F	TED	All I'm sayin' is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life.
F	JOHN	That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot.
F	TED	Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl.
F	JOHN	They're not that bad.
F	TED	The fact that you have to say they're not that bad means that they are that bad. They turn into drunk, half-white, half- pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Jesus, this is weak. It's not even gettin' me high. I gotta have a talk with my weed guy.
F	JOHN	I-- It's workin' for me.
F	TED	I think it sucks, I'm gonna have a talk with him.
F	JOHN	Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints.
F	TED	No, I know this guy a long time. I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, "Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high." JOHN Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work.
F	TED	Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds.
M	JOHN (O.S.)	Jesus, I don't know if I can drive.
F	TED	I'll drive you, I feel fine.
M	JOHN/TED	Aw, Jesus. / Fuck.
F	JOHN	Aw, man.
F	TED	Is it bad?
F	JOHN	It's not good.
M	THOMAS	John! May I speak with you, please?
F	JOHN	Shit.
F	TED	It's okay, go, go, I'll pull outta here. Hi, Thomas! How are ya?
M	OTHER DRIVER	Asshole!
F	TED	Easy, Jersey license!
M	THOMAS	John, it's almost ten o'clock.
F	JOHN	I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. THOMAS What do you mean?
F	JOHN	I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question.
M	THOMAS	John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up. Not that I don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him. But I'm telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck.
F	JOHN	Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me.
M	THOMAS	Good. I like hearing that. Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's not a bad life, is it?
F	JOHN	N--no.
M	THOMAS	Did you know I'm friends with Tom Skerritt?
F	JOHN	No.
M	THOMAS	I'll show you something I don't show too many people, because I don't want anyone treating me differently.
M	THOMAS (CONT'D)	That's me and Tom Skerritt. JOHN Wowwww.
M	THOMAS	Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here. I'm gonna dock you for being late, and for the scratch on that car. Try and be a little more responsible tomorrow.
F	JOHN	I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you down, Goose.
M	THOMAS	What?
F	JOHN	Top Gun.
M	THOMAS	So?
F	JOHN	Tom Skerritt.
M	THOMAS	Oh. CONTINUED:
M	GUY	There you go, here's your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty, drive safely.
M	HUSBAND/WIFE	Thank you./Thanks so much.
M	GUY	Hey, heard you got busted.
F	JOHN	Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened?
M	GUY	I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted last night, and my phone says I texted somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same person saying thanks.
F	JOHN	And you don't remember it?
M	GUY	No. Same as last time. JOHN It... it just seems gay, doesn't it?
M	GUY	I don't know. Maybe, yeah.
F	JOHN	Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs?
M	GUY	I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't remember any of it, I was so fucked up. I might be gay, I don't know. You mind covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go lay down in the john. CONTINUED:
M	ALIX	Hey you buddies. Where's it hanging?
M	GUY/JOHN	Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last night?
M	ALIX	Ah, I didn't get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but I made friends in the line.
M	GUY	Oh, well, that's good I guess.
F	TANYA	Hi you guys.
M	ALIX	You look so pretty today.
F	TANYA	Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this morning.
M	ALIX	I can tell, you are less fat than you have been.
F	JOHN	Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth?
M	GUY	For what?
F	JOHN	Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice.
F	TANYA	Oh wow, congratulations, John.
M	GUY	You guys`ve been goin' out for four years?
F	JOHN	Yeah.
M	GUY	THAT'S IN-- --saaaane, my longest relationship was like six months, and then she farted in her sleep. I'm like, I am outta here, man. Was gone before she woke up.
F	JOHN	Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh. GUY Lori ever fart in front of you?
F	JOHN	Yes.
M	GUY	Really.
F	JOHN	Yes. Many times.
M	GUY	You Italian?
F	JOHN	No. Oh.
F	JOHN	Why?
M	GUY	I dunno, just seems like-- never mind, take her to Benihana.
F	TANYA	Don't you think after four years, maybe she's probably hoping for something more than dinner?
F	JOHN	Like what?
F	TANYA	Well, if I were her, I'd be expecting a proposal.
F	JOHN	Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose. Marriage isn't... I mean, isn't love enough? I submit that love is enough.
M	GUY	You could put the ring in her ass and let her fart it out.
F	JOHN	So bad, but so good.
F	TED	Yes, a study in contrasts.
F	JOHN	Oh, I love this part. HE'S FOR EVERY ONE OF US! TED STAND FOR EVERY ONE OF US!
F	JOHN	HE'LL SAVE WITH A MIGHTY HAND/EVERY MAN EVERY WOMAN EVERY CHILD WITH A MIGHTY FLASH!
F	TED	Fuck yeah, Flash! (then) Hey, before I forget, let's nail down a plan for the Bruins game tomorrow night.
F	JOHN	I can't, I'm taking Lori to dinner.
F	TED	For what?
F	JOHN	Well, we've been dating four years tomorrow.
F	TED	Oh, fuck me. Nice.
F	JOHN	Lemme ask you something... you don't think she's gonna be expecting something... big, do you?
F	TED	What, like anal?
F	JOHN	No, like... a circular gold thing on the finger.
F	TED	Oh, fuck that! It's four years! You and I have been together 27 years!
M	TED (CONT'D)	Where's my ring, Johnny? Where's my ring, asshole?
F	JOHN	Stop it! Jesus Christ, knock it off! He throws Ted off of him.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I mean, do you think she might be expecting me to make that kinda move?
F	TED	No, John. It's a bad idea. And it's the wrong time. What with the economy and... the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
F	JOHN	I guess I didn't think about that. CONTINUED:
M	KLYTUS (ON TV)	Who are you?
M	FLASH (ON TV)	Flash Gordon. Quarterback. New York Jets.
F	JOHN	This is the American fantasy, right here. A professional NFL player is called upon to save the world.
F	TED	Tom Brady could do that.
F	JOHN	Tom Brady could do that. The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her
F	LORI	Hi guys.
F	JOHN	Hey, sweetie.
F	TED	Hey, Lori.
F	LORI	Ooh. I think you just got me stoned.
F	JOHN	What do we got there?
F	LORI	Turkey burgers.
F	TED	Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something?
F	LORI	No, just you homos.
M	TED/JOHN	Whoa!!!
F	TED	She's funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette.
F	LORI	Wait, who's that? Is that good?
F	JOHN	She's a comedienne.
F	LORI	Oh nice. Is she pretty?
F	JOHN	She's as pretty as she is funny. How was work? LORI Good.
F	JOHN	How's your dickhead boss?
F	LORI	Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that's good.
F	JOHN	I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia.
F	LORI	He's harmless, I can handle it.
F	TED	Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a beer, huh?
F	JOHN	Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis?
F	TED	Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now.
F	LORI	Jesus.
F	JOHN	Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski?
F	TED	Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski?
F	LORI	Y'know, I think I might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski.
M	JOHN/TED	Ohhhh, that doesn't work!/Come on, don't ruin it, yeah, that doesn't work.
F	LORI	Bullshit, what do you mean?
F	JOHN	It doesn't work, the name has to have a "ski" at the end of it. You just put "brewski" on the end of Martina Navratolova.
F	LORI	I thought we were just doing funny names.
F	TED	No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end. Otherwise where's the challenge? If there's no "ski" at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense.
F	LORI	Oh, look, they found those missing hikers.
F	JOHN	They did? What happened?
F	LORI	It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days.
F	JOHN	You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free.
F	LORI	You would?
F	JOHN	I sure would. Is that cannibalism?
F	LORI	No, I think it's only cannibalism if you swallow.
F	JOHN	Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow.
F	LORI	Really? That's not what I heard about you.
F	JOHN	It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy broad.
F	LORI	I can see that. Y'know, speaking of classy, Ciao Bella's a really expensive restaurant. If you want, we can go somewhere else tomorrow night. I don't care, as long as we're together.
F	JOHN	You kiddin' me? Four years we been going out, I'm takin' you to the best place in town. I been crappin' out room for it for two days, I know exactly what I'm gonna order.
F	LORI	You're disgusting.
F	JOHN	And you get to pick any bottle of wine.
F	LORI	Ooh.
F	JOHN	Any bottle of 2012 wine.
F	LORI	Oh, are the new wines in?
F	JOHN	They are in and they. Are. Fresh.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I love you.
F	LORI	I love you, too.
F	JOHN	Ah, come on!
F	LORI	I don't understand it, 35 years old, and you're still scared of a little thunder.
F	JOHN	I am not. We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with
F	TED	Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny? C'mon, let's sing the thunder song!
M	JOHN/TED	WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THUNDER, DON'T YOU GET TOO SCARED / JUST GRAB YOUR THUNDER BUDDY AND SAY THESE MAGIC WORDS: FUCK YOU THUNDER, YOU CAN EAT MY ASS / YOU CAN'T GET ME THUNDER, `CAUSE YOU'RE JUST GOD'S FARTS.
F	TED	Boomp. CONTINUED:
F	GINA	Wow...Baby, I'm not saying this to be nasty, but you look really tired.
F	LORI	Oh, I'm okay... except I didn't have time for breakfast, the garage was full, I spilled coffee on my leg, and I have a boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm without his teddy bear.
F	GINA	I don't understand why you keep putting up with him.
F	TRACY	Yeah, I mean, the guy's thirty-five years old and he's working for a rental car service.
F	LORI	No, it's not that, I don't care about that. I'd love him even if he was a janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it's just a bonus that he's like the hottest guy in Boston.
F	GINA	Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is like being the classiest Kardashian.
F	LORI	I just wish he could get his life together, you know? Our life. And he can't, and I swear to god, it's all because of that bear.
F	MICHELLE	You should give him an ultimatum: it's you or the bear.
F	LORI	I can't do that, he'd be devastated. And I mean... what if he chose Ted?
F	MICHELLE	Oh come on, you don't really think that.
F	LORI	Not really, but what if?
F	MICHELLE	Well then... things happen for a reason. TRACY No they don't. That's just something girls say when something bad happens to them that they don't understand.
F	GINA	Fuck off, Tracy.
M	REX	Well hello there. Sorry if I'm interrupting any private girl talk about Channing Tatum's index finger but Lori I need to see you in my office.
F	LORI	Actually Rex, I have a lot of work I need to get to--
M	REX	Oh, this is work, I swear.
F	LORI	Okay, fine.
F	MICHELLE	He's such an asshole.
F	GINA	Out of control. Such a sleaze.
F	TRACY	You guys are so pathetic. You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him.
M	GINA/MICHELLE	Like once./I was drunk.
F	GINA	And so did you.
F	TRACY	Well, I didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me.
F	LORI	So... what do you need to talk to me about, Rex?
M	REX	See that? That's me on the diving team in high school. We dove the shit outta that pool that year. If you look close, you can see the outline of my root.
F	LORI	You promised this was about work.
M	REX	Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don't you like me? I'm rich, I'm good-looking, my dad owns the company--
F	LORI	I have a boyfriend, Rex. I think you know this.
M	REX	Yeah, the guy with the teddy bear, that's a cute relationship, but I'm talking about being with a real man, Lori. CONTINUED: Someone who wears a blazer on an airplane.
F	LORI	I'm very busy.
M	REX	Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head?
F	LORI	Goodbye, Rex.
F	LORI	That was perfect. Would you like me to wrap up your leftovers?
F	LORI	Oh no, I'm fine, thanks.
F	JOHN	Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody.
M	WAITRESS	Sure. CONTINUED:
F	LORI	What are you, five years old?
F	JOHN	Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level.
M	WAITER	Senor. Senora, here is your dessert and champagne.
F	LORI	Ooh, Cristal.
F	JOHN	It's a special night. We've been dating for four years. And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right?
F	LORI	It doesn't seem like four years, does it?
F	JOHN	No, it doesn't.
F	LORI	You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I'm glad you were.
F	JOHN	Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I'm so sorry!
F	LORI	Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
F	JOHN	Oh Jesus, I'm so so sorry! I didn't see you! It was an accident!
F	LORI	Well, yeah, I... I would hope it was an accident.
F	JOHN	Did you hurt your head?
F	LORI	Um, yes. My head hurts a lot.
F	JOHN	Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Sorry. Does it hurt?
F	LORI	N... No. No it's okay.
F	JOHN	I'm... I'm John.
F	LORI	I'm Lori.
F	LORI	Okay, here's a question that'll show how much you actually care about me. You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the little TV in the diner. Name the movie.
F	JOHN	Octopussy.
F	LORI	Gold star.
F	JOHN	But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore?
F	LORI	I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.
F	JOHN	Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad. LORI Your dancing was bad.
F	JOHN	I had some cool moves.
F	LORI	So do people with Parkinson's.
F	JOHN	That's not how I remember it.
F	LORI	Yeah, how do you remember it?
F	LORI	Whatever you say, baby.
F	JOHN	Hey, here's to four more years, huh?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Now I know we said no gifts, but--
F	LORI	No, we didn't.
F	JOHN	--But, I got you something anyway, in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.
F	LORI	There was no such rule. John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small
F	JOHN	Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for a long time.
F	LORI	Oh, John.
F	JOHN	Those are the ones you liked, right? From that kiosk at the mall? LORI Oh. Yeah.
F	JOHN	Check out the card.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	See, I even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn't get bored while you were reading it.
F	LORI	Great. Thanks. Well, um, here. This is for you. CONTINUED:
F	JOHN	Oh wow, a Hamilton!
F	LORI	I remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in GQ.
F	JOHN	Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Y'know, Lori... Someday, there's gonna be a ring in there. But I wanna wait `til I can get you something really special, y'know? I just don't have the money right now.
F	LORI	John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all I want is--
F	JOHN	I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
F	LORI	Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted.
F	JOHN	Oh, Jesus, here we go--
F	LORI	John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives.
F	JOHN	Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?
F	LORI	Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now.
F	JOHN	Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.
F	LORI	Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight. You're thirty-five. And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you.
F	JOHN	I love you, too. You know that.
F	LORI	Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens.
F	JOHN	Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards.
F	LORI	And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you.
F	JOHN	I can do it all with one hand.
F	LORI	Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand.
F	JOHN	I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller.
F	LORI	We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other.
F	JOHN	Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship.
F	LORI	We can't put the real conversation off forever, John.
F	JOHN	I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes.
F	JOHN	Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it?
F	LORI	That's my ringtone?
F	JOHN	Oh, yeah...
F	LORI	What is it? It sounds negative.
F	JOHN	No, it's from The Notebook. This is gonna take some doin'.
F	LORI	All right, well I'll see you upstairs.
F	LORI	What the hell is all this?!
F	TED	Lori! Hey, you're home early! The ladies and I were just watching "Romancing the Stone." Got it on Blu- Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of the Nile," but I don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one.
F	LORI	This place is a wreck! Who are these girls?
F	TED	Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls. Y'know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers I wish I could thank for this great night. CONTINUED:
F	LORI	What is that?!!!
F	TED	What's what?
F	LORI	There is... a shit in the corner! On the floor! There's a shit!
F	TED	Oh man, that's what Dierdre was doin' over there in the corner for so long. Remember, she was crouched over there and I thought she was just makin' a call or SOMETHIN'--
F	LORI	There is a shit!! On my floor!!
F	TED	Yeah, she's passed out in the bathroom now, she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin'. I mean, mystery solved, I GUESS--
F	LORI	What the fuck!!!!
F	TED	Lori, if I can-- now this is just speculation, but... is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight's dinner not measuring up to your expectations?
F	LORI	What!!! The fuck!!! RAAARRRR!!
F	TED	Ahaaaaa!
M	JOHN (V.O., AS LOBSTER)	Who lives here? I'm comin' to get whoever lives here! You owe me lobster money!
F	TED	Hahaaa! That's my friend John. Not the lobster, the guy runnin' it.
F	JOHN	Found my phone. What's goin' on? Is that a shit?
F	TED	God, there are some fucked up fish out there.
F	JOHN	Yeah.
F	TED	Jesus, look at that one. Mister tough guy fish. "Hey! Whatsa big idea? Cold fusion? Well that is a big idea, I beg pardon!" Look at that guy. WASP-y white guy fish. "I don't care for some of Conan O'Brien's humor. I don't like Irish humor. And this food is too flavorful. I don't care for flavor in my food." CONTINUED: "Oh hey, sorry I'm late, guys. Hey, where's everybody goin'? Any of you guys got a tissue? I'm allergic to water."
F	JOHN	Ted... you gotta move out.
F	TED	Wh... what?
F	JOHN	It's... it's gotta happen. Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed.
F	TED	What...what did I do?
F	JOHN	Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and I may just need a little space right now. Plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment.
F	TED	Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us.
F	LORI	Oh, god!!
F	JOHN	Aaaa, what?!
F	LORI	It's so gross!!
F	JOHN	Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear about it! Did you get it?
F	LORI	No! Oh my god!
F	JOHN	Tell me when you get it!
F	LORI	AAAA, I got some on my thumb!
F	JOHN	AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed!
F	LORI	Shit!
F	JOHN	I'll get the next one, okay?
F	TED	She's makin' you do it, isn't she? JOHN Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time!
F	TED	What about... thunder buddies for life, Johnny?
F	JOHN	I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted.
F	TED	I know you do, Johnny.
F	JOHN	I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise.
F	TED	And we'll hang out a lot, right?
F	JOHN	Fuck, all the time.
F	TED	Bring it over here.
M	TED (CONT'D) JOHN	That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know- that doesn't mean-- I'm not - gay.
F	JOHN	We've got to get you a job.
F	TED	I look stupid.
F	JOHN	No, you don't. You look dapper.
F	TED	I look like Snuggles' accountant.
F	JOHN	Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment.
F	TED	I don't wanna work at a grocery store.
F	JOHN	Well, you have no skills.
F	TED	I told you, I can totally be a lawyer.
F	JOHN	As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school.
F	TED	I'm a special case. I'm a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs," but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance I'm turnin' in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case.
F	JOHN	Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after.
F	TED	And if I don't get the job will we still smoke that pot?
F	JOHN	Probably, yes.
F	TED	Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach.
M	FRANK	So. You think you got what it takes?
F	TED	Nope.
M	FRANK	No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired.
F	TED	Shit.
F	TED	Well, I'm a former celebrity with a minimum wage job. This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like.
M	O.S. VOICE	Excuse me.
M	DONNY	I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.
F	JOHN	Oh. Um, thank you.
M	DONNY	I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert. I have to tell you, I've been fascinated by your story ever since I was a boy. I remember seeing you on the Carson show. You were just wonderful.
F	TED	Yeah, that was ah... that was a good time.
M	DONNY	I wonder, is there any chance I could purchase the bear from you? For my son?
M	JOHN/TED	Huh? / Excuse me?
M	ROBERT	I want it.
F	TED	Hey, I'm not an "it", pal. I'm a "he."
F	JOHN	I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. I've had him since I was about your age. He's very special to me.
M	ROBERT	Sit up straight when you talk to me.
F	JOHN	Ew, why the fuck did he say that?
M	DONNY	Don't swear in front of my child. Now. We are very interested in the bear. If you'd like to work out some sort of arrangement, here's my address and phone number.
F	JOHN	Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff.
F	TED	Wow. Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?
F	JOHN	Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme. OH, MY LITTLE SIXPENCE/MY PRETTY LITTLE SIXPENCE/I LOVE MY SIXPENCE BETTER THAN MY LIFE.
F	TED	Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so far? Now it's real. Fuck you again for that. C'mon, let's go find a better place to get stoned.
F	JOHN	Well... I guess this is it, huh?
F	TED	Yeah, sure is.
F	JOHN	First night on your own.
F	TED	Yeah. First night in my beautiful new apartment. They say they're ain't hardly been no murders here. Okay... so... if you need anything...
F	TED	I know.
F	JOHN	Seriously, anything...
F	TED	I know. I'll be fine, Johnny.
F	JOHN	I know you will, buddy.
F	LORI	Hey there.
F	JOHN	Hey.
F	LORI	Listen... I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our relationship.
F	JOHN	Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him.
F	LORI	Y'know, I don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes...
F	JOHN	Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need one. CONTINUED:
F	LORI	You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn't do it.
F	JOHN	Most guys don't have you to motivate `em.
F	LORI	I'm sorry if I was pushy about it...
F	JOHN	No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're... inevitable.
F	LORI	Inevitable. Well, that's... romantic? I think?
F	JOHN	No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're inevitable.
F	LORI	That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend.
F	JOHN	But do you get what I'm saying?
F	LORI	Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you.
M	LORI (CONT'D)	Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me?
F	TED	Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Hey Ellen? ELLEN Yeah?
F	TED	Who's that over there?
F	ELLEN	That's the new bag girl. I don't know her name, but she seems cute.
F	TED	Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty Fozzie. Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy Okay, so that's where we'll draw the line.
F	TANYA	Hey. How you holding up?
F	JOHN	Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used to things, that's all.
F	TANYA	It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went through something like this with my last boyfriend. JOHN Really?
F	TANYA	Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it.
F	JOHN	Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy.
F	TANYA	Yeah.
F	JOHN	Hey, Ted. Johnny. What are you doin'? You wanna come over and catch a buzz?
F	JOHN	I could probably swing by after work.
M	TED (V.O.)	Fuck that, I traded off yesterday, so I got the night shift. C'mon, I'm bored as crap over here, just swing by for a bit.
F	JOHN	I can't just ditch work, man. Look, I'm trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y'know? For Lori's sake.
F	TED	John. Five minutes. And then I'll kick you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews.
F	JOHN	Really?
F	TED	Yeah, and apparently George Wendt confesses to a rape.
F	JOHN	Sometimes adults get high.
F	TED	They do, John. Sometimes they do.
F	JOHN	You'll kick me out in five. John, I have to kick you out. I am extraordinarily busy today, I have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded. Five minutes and you're outta here.
F	JOHN	What do I tell Thomas?
F	TED	Just tell him you don't feel well.
F	JOHN	I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and I guess she got hurt pretty bad.
M	THOMAS	Oh my god.
F	JOHN	Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and I guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass.
M	THOMAS	Jesus, John.
F	JOHN	Yeah, she's pretty shook up.
M	THOMAS	Oh my god. Up the dog's ass, right?
F	JOHN	Yeah, that's how they--
M	THOMAS	That's how they get `em to stop biting, sure.
F	JOHN	Yeah.
M	THOMAS	Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is.
F	JOHN	Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.
M	THOMAS	You don't owe me anything, go.
M	THOMAS (CONT'D)	Jesus.
M	TED DANSON	Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"? Hm. Lemme figure out the best way to answer that. Um...are there naked dicks in gay porn? Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I mean, it was the eighties. And I was king. I was king of the eighties. I was Ted fucking Danson. And not only that, I was Sam fucking Mayday Malone. Was I popular? Gee, lemme think: are there naked dicks in gay porn? Yes, I was quite beloved.
F	JOHN	You know, he's exactly who you want him to be.
F	TED	He is. He is. Someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become.
M	TED DANSON	Woody Harrelson. Smallest dick I've ever seen on a man.
F	TED	Here, try this stuff. I told my guy to step it up, and he gave me this.
F	JOHN	What is it?
F	TED	It's called Kennedy's Head. It's actually pretty mellow.
F	JOHN	That doesn't sound very mellow.
F	TED	No, it's-- it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That's what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it up.
F	JOHN	Y'know, this place looks great.
F	TED	Yeah, it's all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars.
F	JOHN	How are the neighbors?
F	TED	There's an Asian family next door, but they don't have a gong or nothin', so it's fine.
F	JOHN	That's lucky.
F	TED	How's work? JOHN Sucks.
F	TED	Ah.
F	JOHN	You?
F	TED	It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger.
F	JOHN	No way, that's awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what's her name?
F	TED	White trash name. Guess.
F	JOHN	Uh, Mandy?
F	TED	Nope.
F	JOHN	Madison?
F	TED	Nope.
F	JOHN	Britney, Tiffany, Candice? TED Nope.
F	JOHN	Don't fuck with me on this. I know this shit.
F	TED	I know you do, and I am not fucking with you.
F	JOHN	Okay, Brandi, Heather, Channing, Breanna, Amber, Sabrina, Melody, Dakota, Sierra, Bambi, Crystal, Samantha, Autumn, Ruby, Taylor, Tara, Tamra, Tami, Lauren, Charlene, Chantel, Courtney, Misty, Jenna, Krista, Mindy, Noelle, Shelby, Trina, Reba, Cassandra, Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna, Jolene, Earline, Claudine, Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra, Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou, Becky?
F	TED	Nope.
F	JOHN	Okay, was it any one of those names with a Lynn after it?
F	TED	Yep.
F	JOHN	Okay. Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn--
F	TED	Tami-Lynn.
F	JOHN	Fuck!
M	TAMI-LYNN	See, I was all pissed off `cause me and my friend Danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go and I was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun.
F	JOHN	Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then.
M	TAMI-LYNN	I guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y'know?
F	LORI	Jesus. TAMI-LYNN Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever.
F	TED	Hey, isn't this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how've you been? Haven't seen you in forever.
F	LORI	Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something.
F	JOHN	Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm.
F	LORI	It's not that big a deal.
F	TED	Company's turnin' 20, eh? So you can bang it but you can't get it drunk.
F	LORI	I'm surprised John didn't tell you already. Seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out.
F	TED	Well, it's funny, usually the first item on our agenda is "what's goin' on with Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped through the cracks.
F	JOHN	We do, we talk about you all the time.
F	TED	Right?
F	JOHN	Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about... how... neat all of Lori's shoes are?
F	TED	That was a lengthy conversation.
F	JOHN	And we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but Lori has a sort of... regal... trot.
F	TED	A canter.
F	JOHN	Oh my god yes. You canter.
F	LORI	So, Tami, where are you from? Tell us about yourself. I'm always... fascinated to meet Ted's girlfriends.
M	TAMI-LYNN	What do you mean girlfriends? Is there like a lot of `em or somethin'?
F	TED	No, no, that's not what she's sayin' at all, right Lori?
F	LORI	No, right, I was-- all I was doing was asking. Ted's very... attractive, I'm just always interested in the... type of girl that can snatch him up.
M	TAMI-LYNN	Did you just call me a whore? LORI What? No, I--
M	TAMI-LYNN	You just worry about your own snatch, how `bout that, honey?
M	TED/JOHN	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! / What the hell happened? We're havin' a friendly meal here!
M	TAMI-LYNN	Don't talk shit to me!
F	LORI	I was just asking a question.
M	TAMI-LYNN	You're a friggin' snob! You think you're all cool cause you work at some fancy shit place!
F	TED	It's okay, Tami. Nice, Lori. Real nice.
F	LORI	What?! It's not my fault she can't speak English.
M	TAMI-LYNN	Fuck you! Just `cause you're all in the business world and shit, you think everyone's supposed to like, suck your asshole!
F	TED	Baby! Baby! Baby. Baby. Let's get outta here. We'll go back to my place for a couple vodka and strawberry Quiks. Okay? See ya, John.
F	LORI	What a cunt.
F	JOHN	Ooh! I hate that word.
F	LORI	Huh?
F	JOHN	That word is so sharp. It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path.
F	LORI	Well, you didn't exactly stick up for me.
F	JOHN	I... I'm trying to walk a line here, I want to be fair to you and to him, y'know?
F	LORI	Yeah, well, I think you're being a little more fair to him. JOHN Come on.
F	LORI	Y'know, your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was.
F	JOHN	Oh?
F	LORI	Yeah. Because of the dog fight I tried to break up.
F	JOHN	Ohh...
F	LORI	If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to Ted's. Am I right?
F	JOHN	I... I made you out to be a hero.
F	LORI	John, Ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him. You're not really giving anything a chance if you're blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear. JOHN It won't happen again, I promise.
F	LORI	Yes. It will.
M	LORI (CONT'D)	I wanna break up.
F	JOHN	W... What?
F	LORI	I'm just... I'm done. This isn't gonna work. We're in two different places.
F	JOHN	Lori, look, I know--
F	LORI	You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously.
F	JOHN	Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn't easy.
F	LORI	Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me.
F	JOHN	Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance.
F	LORI	I need a man, John. Not a boy with a teddy bear.
F	JOHN	I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart.
F	LORI	John... this really is your last chance. I can't do this anymore.
F	JOHN	You won't have to. Trust me. I love you.
F	LORI	Okay. Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won't be sorry, I swear.
F	LORI	Did you really just fart?
F	JOHN	Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand.
F	LORI	Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first. CONTINUED:
M	GUY AT TABLE	Who did this to us?!
M	GUY #2 AT TABLE	God dammit! I'm here on business! Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a
M	FRANK	What the hell?
M	GUY IN LINE	Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register? There's like a thousand people here!
M	FRANK	There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake!
M	FRANK	You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public.
F	TED	Yes.
M	FRANK	That took guts. We need guts. I'm promoting you. TED Oh.
F	TED	Kareem!
M	TED (CONT'D)	You suck, Kareem. We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and
M	TED (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	DONNY	Hello, Ted.
F	TED	Gah! Uh... hi there.
M	DONNY	Are you all alone out here?
F	TED	Uh... no. No I'm not. I'm... you know, you're never alone when you're with Christ.
M	DONNY	You know, Robert and I could give you a very, very good home.
F	TED	I'm... I'm pretty happy where I am. I just got a shitty new apartment--
M	DONNY	I can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds. They were left to me by my father. TED Well, gosh, you know, since I just returned from active duty in the Civil War, that sounds really appealing. Oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and I don't give a shit.
M	TAMI-LYNN	Teddy, come on-- we're gonna have pop tarts and cigarettes with my mom before she goes to work.
F	TED	Yeah, I'm comin', sweetheart. Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I'm gonna have to decline.
M	DONNY	I really wish you wouldn't...
F	TED	Yeah, sorry. But, ah... you know, I'd like to thank you for creepin' up my night, and... Jesus be with you. In Christ.
F	LORI	I'm glad you're here.
F	JOHN	Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your boss' ass? That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it?
F	LORI	Play nice. Please. Rex throws open the door.
M	REX	There she is! I was worried you weren't coming! Hi kiddo, how ya doin'? Where's your bunny rabbit?
F	JOHN	He's a bear.
M	REX	Got it. "Hey, this house is fucking huge!" I know guys, try not to get lost.
M	REX	Oh, here come the ladies. Say listen, why don't John and I give you gals a chance to talk tampax while we go grab a drink at the bar, huh?
F	LORI	Sure.
M	REX	...and that's a Wade Boggs autographed bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction.
F	JOHN	Wow, cool.
M	REX	Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were worn by Joe Louis in his first fight. This is art. Do you get it? These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth about two million dollars. That's me and Tom Skerritt. Oh, and check this out.
M	REX (CONT'D)	See that? Know what that is?
F	JOHN	No.
M	REX	That's Lance Armstrong's nut.
M	REX (CONT'D)	Something, isn't it? Had it freeze-dried and bronzed. CONTINUED: Every now and then, when I feel like my life's gettin' me down and things are tough, I just come in here and look at it, and it reminds me that things aren't so bad. That some people have it worse than me. I mean, he's only got one ball, and I have three. One of them, of course, being his.
F	JOHN	That's inspiring. You've led a rich life.
M	REX	I've fucked the shit outta life. So talk to me, Goose. How are things with you and Lori?
F	JOHN	Things are great, actually.
M	REX	That's good, that's good.
F	JOHN	You know... Lori would hate me for saying this, but... she's told me how you are at the office, and... as one gentleman to another, I just wanna say I really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease.
M	REX	Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I... just want you to know that... I mean, yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and whatnot, but... look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I'm just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that's it. I think you're a great guy and she's very lucky.
F	JOHN	Well... that's good to hear.
M	REX	Well, that's how it is, so...there we go.
F	JOHN	Okay.
M	REX	Yeah.
F	JOHN	Hey, Ted.
M	TED (V.O.)	Johnny! You gotta get over here, man! JOHN Why? What's going on?
M	TED (V.O.)	I'm havin' a little impromptu thing with some people, and John... Sam Jones is here.
F	JOHN	What?! Sam Jones. Flash fucking Gordon. Is here.
F	JOHN	Holy shit! How?
F	TED	Remember I said, my buddy's cousin is friends with Sam Jones? My buddy's in town with his cousin and who's with `em?
M	TED (V.O.)	Sam Jones is here, and John... ...his hair is parted down the middle.
F	JOHN	Just like in the movie.
F	TED	Get over here.
F	JOHN	Fuck! I can't... I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I just... I can't.
F	TED	John. There are moments in a man's life: Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country." Alan Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on `Gilligan's Island.'"
M	TED (V.O.)	John, this is your Alan Hale moment. For god's sake, come share this with me.
F	JOHN	I'm coming. Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out. She absolutely cannot know I was gone. If you can cover for me... we're cool on all that other stuff.
M	REX	I got your back, my friend. Been there. She'll never know.
F	JOHN	This is one man to another. I don't really know you, but I'm trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you?
M	REX	Dude. One man to another. I got you on this.
F	JOHN	Okay. Thank you.
M	REX	I'm gonna make traditional to your girlfriend. And then fuck her in the ass. All right. We have a game plan.
F	TED	Johnny! Thank Christ you made it!
F	JOHN	I got ten minutes, where's Flash Gordon?
F	TED	Okay, get ready, man. Hey, Sam! This is the guy I was tellin' you about!
F	TED	John, this is Sam Jones. Sam, this is my best friend in the whole world, John.
M	SAM	Hi there. Good to meet you.
F	JOHN	I... thank you for saving every one of us.
M	SAM	You're welcome. Hey, let's do some shots, huh?
F	JOHN	With you? Yes. Oh my god, yes.
M	SAM	Death to Ming! John and Ted look at each other, squealing with delight.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Hey, you guys seem pretty cool. You like to party?
M	SAM (CONT'D)	Aw, come on dudes. Don't tell me you've never done it before.
F	JOHN	Not... recently, no.
M	SAM	You fellas better come with me.
F	TED	Wow.
M	SAM	Let's party like the `80's huh?
F	TED	Show us how, Flash.
M	SAM	It's easy. We just gotta bang a lotta girls named Stephanie.
F	JOHN	Holy shit. All these people need to be talked to.
F	TED	Look Johnny, if we're ever gonna get serious about openin' a restaurant we gotta start plannin' it now.
F	JOHN	Italian.
F	TED	Italian, yes.
F	JOHN	What's the special on Tuesdays?
F	TED	Eggplant parm. JOHN Chopped salad half price.
F	TED	And it's a non-restricted place.
F	JOHN	Yeah--wait, whaddaya mean?
F	TED	Anybody can come.
F	JOHN	Of course.
F	TED	Mormons are welcome.
F	JOHN	Well yeah--why wouldn't they be?
F	TED	Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
F	JOHN	But why even bring that up--
F	TED	You don't bring it up. You just let `em in.
F	JOHN	Yeah, but why mention it?
F	TED	No one will.
F	JOHN	So why are we talking about it?
F	TED	You're talkin' about it, I'm just sayin' let `em in.
F	JOHN	Yes, let `em in.
F	TED	Exactly.
F	JOHN	Right.
F	TED	Good.
F	JOHN	Okay.
F	TED	No Catholics, though.
F	TED	No see, I can do this.
M	GUY #1	Shut up.
F	TED	My teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes.
M	GUY #2	Let him try it, man.
M	GUY #1	Fuck it, all right.
F	TED	Well, you never shoulda trusted me, I'm on drugs!
F	JOHN	Hey Johnny, I just had a great idea-- let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass!
F	TED	Oh god, that was a fun day.
F	JOHN	Johnny, you gotta get over here man, I just tried this DMT all the kids are talkin' about, and I'm in trouble! I think I got sucked inside my chair!
F	TED	I do not sound that much like Peter Griffin.
F	TED	See? There. Proof. Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits.
M	TAMI-LYNN	Okay, you were right.
F	TED	Okay, Johnny, c'mon up here and do this with me! JOHN No no.
F	TED	Come on!
F	JOHN	No, I don't sing in front of people!
F	TED	YOU AND ME, WE COME FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS. YOU LIKE TO LAUGH AT ME WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER GIRLS. SOMETIMES YOU'RE CRAZY AND YOU WONDER WHY I'M SUCH A BABY `CAUSE DOLPHINS MAKE CRY. WELL THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU. YOU LOOK AT ME YOU'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO SAY. I'LL ONLY POUT AT YOU UNTIL I GET MY WAY. I WON'T DANCE. YOU WON'T SING. I JUST WANT TO LOVE YOU BUT YOU WANT TO WEAR MY RING. WELL THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU. YOU CAN CALL ME YOUR FOOL, I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU.
F	TED	See there's this one part of the wall that's really soft, you could punch through it wicked easy.
M	SAM/TED/JOHN	Holy shit! / Ha! / Wow! / Etc.
M	ASIAN MAN	What the hell you problem!! You break my wall! You break my wall I break you wall!
F	JOHN	AAA! AAA!! Break his arm, Flash! Cut his arm off!!
M	ASIAN MAN	You break my wall! This my home long time! You break my wall! You bastard men! JOHN/TED Dude, we're sorry! We're sorry!
M	ASIAN MAN	You bastard men! I try to make duck dinner, now plaster everywhere!
F	TED	Chill out okay? We'll pay for it! Let's talk this out okay? What's your name? I'm John!
M	ASIAN MAN	My name Wan Ming.
M	FLASH	Ming!
M	ASIAN MAN	You pay many dollar for wall! This bullshit! This all bullshit!
M	SAM	DEATH TO MING!!! JOHN Sam, no! Get off him!

M	ASIAN MAN	Come on, James Franco!
M	ASIAN MAN (CONT'D)	You pay for wall!
F	JOHN	Guy?
M	GUY	Hey. What's goin' on. This is Jared. He's the guy who beat me up. We're in love.
F	JOHN	What??
M	GUY	Yeah. Turns out I'm gay or whatever. Had no idea. C'mon Jared, let's get a drink. ANGLE ON JOHN, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out
M	SAM	How you doin' there, ace? You comin' down?
F	JOHN	Yeah. Yeah, I don't feel good.
M	SAM	Give it a couple hours, you'll be golden, Pony Boy. Want a Xanax?
F	JOHN	Holy shit. Holy shit, oh my god!
M	SAM	What?
F	JOHN	I gotta-- I gotta go! Shit!
F	JOHN	Lori... I...
F	JOHN	Lori! Lori wait! I'm sorry! I messed up! I--
F	LORI	I want you out of the apartment... tonight. Gimme my car keys.
F	JOHN	Can I please just explain--
F	LORI	No.
F	JOHN	I was gonna--
F	LORI	I have given up a big chunk of my life for you.
F	JOHN	I was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon--
F	LORI	Just give me my keys, John!
F	JOHN	Lori... please. I love you.
F	TED	Johnny, come on upstairs. Tami-Lynn's gonna make some RC Cola from scratch.
F	JOHN	Fuck you! I don't want to talk to you!
F	TED	What?
F	JOHN	Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended.
F	TED	Oh come on, she'll go home, watch Bridget Jones' Somethin' Asshole, cry a little bit, she'll be fine, you'll talk to her tomorrow.
F	JOHN	Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?!
F	TED	Well... `course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life.
F	JOHN	Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life.
F	TED	Johnny, I'm... I'm sorry.
F	JOHN	I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore.
F	TED	Johnny, wait! Hey, listen! CONTINUED: John sits on the bed and turns on the TV. He flips CONTINUED:
M	REX	So, word through the grapevine is you are newly solo. I have tickets to see Norah Jones at the Hatch Shell tonight, and I would love it if you'd go with me.
F	LORI	You're asking me out the day after I broke up with someone.
M	REX	Look, I'm gonna cut the shit here. LORI Okay.
M	REX	This is the first time you've been single in all the years you've worked here. Just go out with me one time. And if you're miserable and you hate it, I promise I will never even hint at the subject again. Please.
F	LORI	Rex, I don't think it's smart.
M	REX	Look, I'm an asshole. I know that. It worked for me in high school, and it's been like a reflex ever since. (sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk. Besides, you're a huge catch and it's about time somebody treated you that way.
F	LORI	Fine... I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night.
M	REX	Great. Pick you up at seven? It's raining outside.
F	JOHN	Who is it?
F	TED	Johnny, it's me.
F	JOHN	Go away.
F	TED	Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna talk.
F	JOHN	JESUS--
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Jesus Christ!
F	TED	Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with Rex.
F	JOHN	What?
F	TED	I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.
F	JOHN	You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her--
F	TED	Johnny, it's the truth. I'm tellin' ya--
F	JOHN	Get outta here.
F	TED	You know, you're actin' like a cock, you know that?
F	JOHN	What? I'm acting like a cock?
F	TED	Yes. You are actin' like a giant, V- shaped-funny-lookin'-guy-in-a-porno cock.
F	JOHN	Huh?
F	TED	`Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cock--forget it. What I'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Lori was right about you. You can't take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life.
F	JOHN	Oh, and you can?
F	TED	I don't have to, I'm a fuckin' teddy bear! Y'know somethin', I didn't tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend.
F	JOHN	Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life?
F	TED	Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship.
F	JOHN	You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it?
F	TED	Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind? That's your choice, John! And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.
F	JOHN	You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.
F	TED	Say that one more time.
F	JOHN	Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin. CONTINUED:
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ! god fucking dammit!!! Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and
F	TED	C'mon, motherfucker!
M	TED (CONT'D)	Why...why are you crying?
F	JOHN	My dick is in the TV.
F	TED	I'm so sorry, Johnny. I'm so sorry.
F	JOHN	So am I, man.
F	TED	I love you.
F	JOHN	I love you, too.
F	TED	Listen... you gotta let me help you make things right with you and Lori. JOHN There is no putting things right. She hates me.
F	TED	No, John, we can get her back. Look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying? Remember? And then we ran up to it and tried to give it CPR? And it came back to life? John, we could do that again.
F	JOHN	Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR. It died.
F	TED	We can get Lori back.
M	REX	God, she's so brave. YOUR MUSIC IS SO FUCKING BRAVE!! Norah finishes the song.
F	NORAH	Thanks so much! We're gonna take a short break, but we'll be back in a few!
M	TED (O.S.)	Hey, play chopsticks, you jazzy slut!
F	NORAH	Teddy!! How you doin', you fuzzy little asshole?
F	TED	Well, I'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I'm hangin' in there.
F	NORAH	Well, half-Indian, but thanks.
F	TED	Eh, ooga booga, whatever. Hey, I want you to meet a good pal of mine. Hey Johnny, come on in! CONTINUED:
M	TED (CONT'D)	Norah, this is my friend John.
F	JOHN	Hi. Hi, Norah Jones.
F	NORAH	Ha. Whoa, relax there, sweaty. You ready to bring down the house?
F	JOHN	Yes ma'am. Thank you for the opportunity, Ms.-- Ma'am Jones.
F	TED	Jesus, you look fantastic.
F	NORAH	Well, you're probably not used to seeing me fully clothed.
F	TED	Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at Belinda Carlisle's house and we had awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.
F	NORAH	Actually, you weren't so bad for a guy with no penis.
F	TED	I have written so many letters to Hasbro about that.
F	NORAH	Okay, I'm gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage. He's gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much. Let's give a big hand to John Bennett! CONTINUED:
F	LORI	Oh my god.
F	JOHN	Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins. Because I love her. This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. The night we met. It's the theme song from the movie "Octopussy." ALL I WANTED WAS A SWEET DISTRACTION FOR AN HOUR OR TWO / HAD NO INTENTION TO DO THE THINGS WE'VE DONE / FUNNY HOW IT ALWAYS GOES WITH LOVE, WHEN YOU DON'T LOOK, YOU FIND / BUT THEN WE'RE TWO OF A KIND / WE MOVE AS ONE
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	WE'RE AN ALL-TIME HIGH / WE'LL CHANGE ALL THAT'S GONE BEFORE / DOING SO MUCH MORE /
M	REX	You suck, get off the stage! Hey, come on guys!
M	CROWD	Get off the stage! / Boooo! / You suck! / We wanna hear Norah! / Come on!
F	TED	Ah, god.
F	JOHN	SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT BEGIN... CONTINUED:
M	CRAZY GUY	You're an asshole!
F	NORAH	Jesus.
M	STAGEHAND	Someone call an ambulance!
M	REX	That was insane. Did you see the way that guy's body hit the ground? It was like a rag doll!
F	LORI	Yeah, I'd rather just not talk about it.
M	REX	You want to go get a drink after this? I feel like I could use one after seeing a guy almost die.
F	LORI	Nope, I think I'd rather you just take me home.
M	REX	One drink, come on.
F	LORI	Nope, not really feeling up to it.
M	REX	Alright, alright, I get it. I don't blame you. When you think about it, it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that.
F	LORI	Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed. Listen, John and I may have our problems but at least he tried. You know what? I don't feel like talking to you about this.
M	REX	Where you going?
F	LORI	Taking a cab. I'm going home.
M	REX	Finally.
M	TED (O.S.)	Down here, I swear to god I'm not lookin' up your towel.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Not lookin' up your towel. Not lookin' at your funny business.
F	LORI	Ted? What're you doing here? What do you want?
F	TED	I need to talk to you.
F	LORI	Look, if you're here to fight John's battle for hi--
F	TED	Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you want. There's a beat. She reluctantly considers.
F	TED	Look, John loves you very much. More than anything in the world. And he's fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you. He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn't all his fault. If you'll just give him one more chance to be with you--
M	TED (CONT'D)	Listen to me! If you'll just give him one more chance... I promise I will leave and never come back. He'll be all yours. Just give him one more chance.
F	LORI	Ted... that's a very nice offer, but I don't want you to do that. This is about John and me and our problems. And I don't think it can be fixed.
F	TED	Because of me! Look, you want him to be a man. And I'm the one who's keepin' that from happening. As long as he's got his teddy bear, he's still a boy. And I care about him as much as you do. But I'm willing to give up the boy so you can have the man. CONTINUED:
M	TED (CONT'D)	Look, I'm givin' this the best shot I got here, Lori. I'm beggin' you. I'm no good at this emotional crap, but I gotta help my best friend. Please. Just talk to him.
F	LORI	I'll talk to him.
F	TED	Thank you. He's waitin' for me down at Charley's. So... maybe you could, y'know... go down instead of me? LORI What... now?
F	TED	Please. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't.
F	LORI	Alright, alright, I'll go.
F	TED	Hey, you mind if I stay and watch the Sox?
M	TED (CONT'D)	Jesus Christ, what a chick fridge. Yoplait, a cantaloupe, and a Brita water filter.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Michelob Ultra Tuscan Orange Grapefruit. My god, America is imploding. CONTINUED:
M	TED (CONT'D)	Forget your keys? You know, your beer suck--
M	DONNY	Hi, Ted.
F	TED	Fuck.
F	JOHN	Lori! What-- what are you doing here?
F	LORI	You can thank Ted.
M	LORI (CONT'D)	How are you?
F	JOHN	Good, good. I've, uh... made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street. I'd show you around, but it's kinda classy. They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers.
F	LORI	Well. Shall I sit?
F	JOHN	Uh, yeah.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	So, work's good? Everything good there?
F	LORI	Yeah. Work's fine.
F	JOHN	How's Rex?
F	LORI	There is no Rex.
F	JOHN	Oh. Good. Well... I guess we can't make small talk all day, so I'll say what I wanna say. I could sit here and tell you I'm sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm ready to change. But I don't think you wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not gonna try and get you to take me back. Why would you? I've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years. I don't deserve you. I didn't take our relationship seriously, even though I love you more than life itself. All I want is... just to end on good terms. Because I owe that to you. I want you to be happy... and for us to be friends.
F	LORI	Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that.
F	JOHN	Well. That's pretty much it. TED Whoa...
M	DONNY	Yes, as you can see, you've been part of our family for quite some time. Welcome home.
F	TED	Heh, you know what's hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house.
M	ROBERT	Daddy, is he all mine?
M	DONNY	He's all yours, my little winner. You've arrived at a lucky time, Ted. It's almost Robert's play hour.
F	TED	I'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3. I'm guessin' you're more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family.
F	TED	Huh. Wig horse.
M	DONNY	Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now. So you will do as he says.
F	TED	Y'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid.
M	DONNY	LANGUAGE!!!
M	DONNY (CONT'D)	When I was a little boy, I saw you on television. And I thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father if I could have a magical teddy bear, too. And he said no. And I was heartbroken. I decided that if I ever had a son, I would never say no to him.
F	TED	Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt.
M	ROBERT	Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, daddy.
M	DONNY	Yes. You are. Happy play time. Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted.
F	TED	Jesus fucking Christ!
M	ROBERT	No! Daddy said no bad words!
F	TED	Yeah well, fuck your dad.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Shit! CONTINUED:
M	ROBERT	I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it.
F	TED	That's a great story, I felt like I was there.
M	ROBERT	Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to give you an ouch.
F	TED	Okay... okay, kid. You win. We'll do it your way. You wanna play a game or somethin'? It's play time, let's play a game.
M	ROBERT	Yeah, I wanna play a game!
F	TED	Good, good, hey, how `bout we play a little game of hide and seek?
M	ROBERT	I love hide and seek! I'll hide!
F	TED	Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right?
M	ROBERT	Yes.
F	TED	Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don't ya think?
M	ROBERT	Okay, you hide first.
F	TED	Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay? Do I need to wash my hands before this game?
F	TED	You... well-- no, you-- god, that's a weird fuckin' question, no, just start countin'.
M	ROBERT	One... two... three...
F	TED	Okay, no peekin', now, or you'll get kid cancer.
M	DONNY	Robert? How's play time?
M	ROBERT	Good, daddy!
M	DONNY	Ted, are you making friends with Robert?
M	DONNY (CONT'D)	Ted?
M	ROBERT (O.S.)	Daddy, you're gonna ruin the game!
M	DONNY	Okay. Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter. He
F	LORI	Hey.
F	JOHN	Hey.
F	LORI	Kinda late to be walkin' home by yourself.
F	JOHN	Oh, I'll be okay. If I get raped, it'll be my fault with what I'm wearing.
F	LORI	Listen, John... there's something I wanna say to you, too.
F	JOHN	Go ahead.
F	LORI	John, I just want you to know that... I mean, I hope you don't think that--
M	LORI (CONT'D)	I, um... I just feel like we should... keep talking. Because--
F	JOHN	Whoever this is, it's not a good time.
F	TED	John! It's me! Can you hear me?
F	JOHN	Ted?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Listen, I gotta call you back.
F	TED	No, John! Don't hang up, I'm in trouble!
F	JOHN	What do you mean, what kinda trouble?
F	TED	They got me! That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid!
F	JOHN	What?
F	TED	I'm in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won't let me outta here! They tore my ear off!
F	JOHN	Wait, slow down! Where are you?
F	TED	Uh... I'm not sure, it's uh--
M	DONNY	You're not a very polite guest.
F	TED	Shit.
F	JOHN	Ted? Ted? Hello? Ted!
F	LORI	What's the matter, is he all right?
F	JOHN	I don't know.
F	LORI	Where is he?
F	JOHN	I don't know, but he's in trouble.
F	LORI	Why? What happened? Can you call him back?
F	JOHN	No, it's blocked-- wait a second.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Go! Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway!
M	DONNY	You've put us in a pickle here, haven't you? We have to go now.
F	TED	Yeah, good idea. Aaaa!
M	ROBERT	Found you. CONTINUED:
F	TED	AAAAAA!
M	DONNY	We tried to make do with other teddy bears. But none of them were you, Ted.
F	JOHN	It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They got him somehow. LORI Which way?
F	JOHN	Shoot up 99!
F	JOHN	Hello, 911? I need the police right away! This guy took my teddy bear! ...Hello?
M	DONNY	Robert, seat belt. Whoa whoa, stop stop stop!
F	TED	Johnny!
F	JOHN	Come on, we're losing him!
F	JOHN	Get closer!
F	LORI	I'm trying!
F	TED	Aaaaa! Shit!!
M	ROBERT	No! You're being bad!
F	TED	Back off, Susan Boyle.
F	JOHN	Easy...
F	LORI	I know.
F	JOHN	EASY--
F	LORI	I know!
F	TED	Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right?
F	JOHN	Yes! Fuckin' A right!
F	TED	God dammit!
F	LORI	Shit! ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind NO!!
M	ROBERT (CONT'D)	You can't have my teddy bear!!
F	LORI	Oh my god.
F	JOHN	Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid. Come on!
F	LORI	Look!
F	JOHN	Oh Jesus... Stay here.
F	LORI	Wait, John! What are you--
F	JOHN	STAY THERE!! Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the CONTINUED:
F	JOHN	Ted!
F	LORI	Oh my God...
F	TED	Johnny...
F	JOHN	Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all!
F	TED	Johnny...
F	JOHN	You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine.
F	TED	Jesus, I look like the robot from "Aliens".
F	JOHN	No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay.
F	TED	I... I don't think so. I'm... I'm in trouble. I need... I need to tell you something.
F	JOHN	What is it?
F	TED	Don't... don't ever lose her again. She's the most important... most important part of your life. CONTINUED: Even more than me. She's your thunder buddy now. She's--
F	LORI	John... I don't know if this is gonna--
F	JOHN	Just try. Please. Just try.
F	LORI	John... I'm sorry. You did everything you could. I'm... I'm just so sorry.
M	LORI (CONT'D)	You're not afraid... CONTINUED:
F	JOHN	Ted!
F	TED	I'm alive, Johnny!
F	JOHN	Oh my god!
F	TED	I'm alive! Your magical wish worked!
F	JOHN	You're back!
F	TED	Yeah! I mean, when you sewed me up, you put some of the stuffing in the wrong places, so I'm a little fucked up. Will you take care of me forever and ever?
M	TED (CONT'D)	Nah, I'm just kiddin' ya, I thought it'd be funny if you thought I was fuckin' retarded.
F	JOHN	You asshole!
F	LORI	Welcome back, Ted.
F	JOHN	It... it was you. You did it. (cover this line with addition:) It was your wish.
M	TEDDY	Son of a bitch...You wished for my life back.
F	LORI	No. I wished for my life back. Because I love you both.
F	TED	You were pretty great out there at Fenway, Johnny.
F	LORI	Yeah, that's my big brave man.
F	JOHN	Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I mean if that's what it's like to hit a woman, watch out, I liked it.
F	LORI	I love you.
F	JOHN	I love you, too. And, I want you to know that... I'm probably never gonna be any more than a guy who rents cars, but... I don't care. You're the only thing that matters in my life. AY--
F	JOHN	You and Ted. Yes!
F	JOHN	And after last night, I... I don't ever want to lose anyone who matters to me ever again. I'm not gonna wait any longer for my life to start. Lori... will you marry me?
F	LORI	That's all I ever wanted.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	And so John, Lori, and Ted lived happily ever after, having discovered at last that all they really needed was each other. John and Lori were married in a beautiful ceremony in Cambridge, by a very special Justice of the Peace.
M	SAM JONES	I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
F	TED	Y'know Sam, there's only one way to end a perfect day.
M	SAM JONES	What's that?
F	TED	On three.
M	SAM JONES	What on three?
F	TED	Flash jump.
M	SAM JONES	Right. One... two... three. YEAH!!!
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	And that's the story of how one magical wish forever changed the lives of three very special friends.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Ted and Tami-Lynn continued their torrid love affair for quite some time. One afternoon Ted was caught behind the deli counter eating potato salad off of Tami- Lynn's bare bottom. He was instantly promoted to store manager.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Sam Jones moved back to Hollywood with the goal of restarting his film career. He currently resides in Burbank where he shares a studio apartment with his roommate Brandon Routh.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Remember Brandon Routh from that god- awful "Superman" movie? Jesus Christ. Thanks for getting our hopes up and taking a giant shit on us.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Rex gave up his pursuit of Lori. Not long after he fell into a deep depression and died of Lou Gehrig's disease.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Donny was arrested by Boston police and charged with kidnapping a plush toy. The charges were dropped when everyone realized how completely stupid that sounded.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	Robert got a trainer, lost a substantial amount of weight, and went on to become Taylor Lautner.
