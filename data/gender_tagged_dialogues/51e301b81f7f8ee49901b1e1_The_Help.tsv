M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	AIBILEEN	I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont Plantation in Cherokee County. An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.
M	WOMAN (O.C.)	Did you know as a girl, growing up, that one day you'd be a maid?
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am. I did.
M	WOMAN (O.C.)	And you knew that because?
F	AIBILEEN	Momma was a maid. My grandmother was a house slave.
M	WOMAN (0.C.)	Oh. The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.
M	WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)	A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay. Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.
M	WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)	Now, did you ever dream of being something else? Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.
M	WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)	Well then, what's it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home...being looked after by somebody else?
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	I done raised seventeen kids in my life. Lookin' after white babies, that's what I do.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	I know how to get them babies asleep, stop cryin' and go in the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin.' Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Babies like fat. They like big fat legs too. That I know. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D)	I work from eight to four, six days a week. Ninety-five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy-two dollars ever month. I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing and grocery shopping, but mostly, I take care a baby girl...And law, I worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna be no beauty queen either. Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	You is kind. You is smart. You is important. Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour! Did you finish the chicken salad? Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No paprika! Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Does this dress look homemade?
F	AIBILEEN	I reckon when you finish, it won't. Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day. The birthin' blues had got holt a Miss Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it happen plenty a times...once babies start havin' they own babies. And the young white ladies of Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin' some babies.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	But, not Miss Skeeter... Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	No babies...No man...And not lookin'. She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to
M	MR. BLACKLY	Shut the Goddamn door! He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down.
M	MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)	They announced last week cigarettes'll kill you. Okay, let's see what you got. Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resumé. He skims it
M	MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)	"Murrah High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel Rouser Editor, double major, Junior League editor...Damn girl, didn't you have any fun?
F	SKEETER	Is that...important? Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resumé back to Skeeter.
M	MR. BLACKLY	You got any references? Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a
M	MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)	That...is a rejection letter. Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick.
F	SKEETER	Not exactly. Missus Stein- -STEIN?! Missus who? Skeeter points toward the letterhead.
F	SKEETER	Elaine Stein, Senior Editor at Harper and Row Publishing. In New York. I'm going to be a serious writer, Mr. Blackly. So, when I applied to Harper and Row, Missus
M	MR. BLACKLY	-She told you "no."
F	SKEETER	Until I gain some experience, Mr. Blackly! See, it says it right there at the end. "Great potential...Gain some experience and please apply again." Mr. Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth. Oh, Christ...I guess you'll do. Can you clean?
F	SKEETER	Clean? Mr. Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door.
M	MR. BLACKLY	Clean! Mr. Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and
M	MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)	Miss Myrna's gone shit-house crazy on us, drunk hair spray or something. Read her past columns and all these letters. Answer them just like she did, nobody'll know the damn difference. Skeeter forces a smile.
M	MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)	You know who Miss Myrna is? I read her articles all the time.
M	MR. BLACKLY	Articles? Ha! It's a cleaning advice column, Miss Phelan. Eight bucks a week. Copy due Thursday. Mr. Blackly picks up the phone and starts yelling at someone. Momma! We're late for bridge! Hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder. She
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Miss Hilly was the first of the babies to have a baby. And it must a come out of her like the eleventh commandment. `Cause once Miss Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the bridge table wanted one too.
F	HILLY	Minny! Go get Momma!
F	MINNY	Missus Walters?! You need help coming down? MISSUS WALTERS, 60, passes quietly behind Minny.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	I'm down! Minny jumps with a yelp, spins around.
M	MISSUS WALTERS (CONT'D)	Been down.
F	MINNY	Gone give me a heart attack! Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door. Minny quickly
M	MISSUS WALTERS	Minny, I'm getting my coat. Missus Walters opens the closet.
F	MINNY	It's ninety degrees out there, Missus Walters. Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard, Miss Hilly moved her and Minny in with her. Fired the maid she had just to make room. See, Minny about the best cook in Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted her. Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her Minny and Missus Walters follow. Minny carries a chocolate
F	HILLY	Minny, William took Billy out for ice cream. So, hurry back and get Billy down for his nap. No dilly dallying.
F	MINNY	Yes, ma'am. Minny raises the pie behind Hilly's beehive, dreaming of
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Minny my best friend. A old lady like me lucky to have her.
M	MAE MOBLEY	No! It's a tricky thing...you try to make a baby go in the toilet bowl before it's time. If theys can't get the hang of it, theys get to thinking low a theyselves. Mae Mobley sticks her lip out. You drunk up two glasses a grape juice, I know you got to tee-tee.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Nooo. Mae Mobley shakes her head.
F	AIBILEEN	I give you a cookie if you go. Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Mae Mobley! You going! Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen, the girls are pulling up, and the table isn't set!
M	MAE MOBLEY	Mae Mobley go, Momma!
F	ELIZABETH	Get in your room! Right now! Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg.
M	MAE MOBLEY	I sorry. Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waitin' on the Leefolts... Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore. Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.
F	HILLY	Hey, girls! YOUNG WOMEN Hey, Hilly! Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm.
F	HILLY	Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	I'm not deaf yet, Hilly. Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a "here we
F	HILLY	Aibileen, I want you to have this coat. It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive. Hilly extends the coat with a smile.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	All yours. Aibileen takes the coat.
F	AIBILEEN	Thank you, Miss Hilly.
F	HILLY	Go on. Try it on. Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared
F	AIBILEEN	Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's. Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Gots to have paprika on `em. Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite.
F	MINNY	Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have to kill that woman.
F	AIBILEEN	Watch yo mouth, Minny.
F	MINNY	Looks like a walking Christmas present with all them bows. Aibileen shakes with silent laughter.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	And, now she gone to puttin' pencil marks on the toilet paper.
F	AIBILEEN	Oh, law! Did she?
F	MINNY	Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from my own damn house. That fool don't know.
F	SKEETER	Hey, girls. Hey, Skeeter. JOLENE FRENCH, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter.
F	JOLENE	Well, if it isn't Long-Haul- Skeeter. We didn't think you'd ever leave Ole Miss.
F	SKEETER	Well, it's supposed to take four years, Jolene. Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by the cleaners and pick up my black dress. Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	What?
F	HILLY	About supper club tonight...Honey, Stuart had to cancel.
F	SKEETER	Again? Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder.
F	HILLY	He can't get off the rig, Skeeter. It's offshore! Stuart is a very successful oil man.
F	SKEETER	I'm starting to think this Stuart is a figment of your imagination.
F	ELIZABETH	Raleigh called his cousin down in Hattiesburg. He'll drive up.
F	SKEETER	The cousin with one eye?! Elizabeth nods.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	I guess his black patch will match my dress. Just forget it. Skeeter storms off. Hilly glares at Elizabeth.
F	HILLY	One eye?!
F	SKEETER	I got a job today... at The Jackson Journal! Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself.
F	HILLY	They'd be a fool not to hire you. Jolene raises her glass.
F	JOLENE	To Skeeter...and her job. Last stop `til marriage. Hilly kicks Jolene under the table.
F	SKEETER	The Miss Myrna column. Have y'all read it?
F	HILLY	Well, no! But, I bet the poor girls without any help, in South Jackson, read it like the King James. Everyone laughs. Skeeter's forehead crinkles.
F	SKEETER	Elizabeth, would you mind if I talk to Aibileen? To help me answer some of the letters? Just until I get a knack for it. Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing.
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen? My Aibileen? What can't you just get Constantine to help you? Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head.
F	SKEETER	Constantine...quit us.
M	ELIZABETH HILLY	What?! Oh, my gosh! Skeeter nods her head sadly.
F	HILLY	I'm so sorry, Skeeter.
F	SKEETER	I really don't want to talk about it. Okay? The girls nod. Anyway...I don't know how to answer these letters. Elizabeth looks to Aibileen.
F	ELIZABETH	Well...I mean as long as it doesn't interfere with her work. A phone rings. Elizabeth nods to Aibileen. Leefolt residence. Pink, fuzzy slippers anchoring bare, sexy legs stand on a
M	CELIA FOOTE (O.C.)	Ah-hem. Hello, is Elizabeth in? Rising up a slim torso, sizeable cleavage bursts out of a
F	AIBILEEN	She having bridge club right now. May I take a message? CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in
F	CELIA	Please tell her Celia Foote called again. I'll call back tomorrow.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am. Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord.
F	CELIA	Ah-hem. Miss? "Miss" strikes Aibileen as very odd.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	I'm looking for some help at my house. You know any maids looking?
F	AIBILEEN	No, ma'am.
M	CELIA FOOTE	Okay. Celia Foote. Emerson 6-8-4. Bye, now. Celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca-
F	ELIZABETH	Who was that on the phone?
F	AIBILEEN	Miss Celia Foote called again. Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm.
F	ELIZABETH	I've never called her back, Hilly.
F	HILLY	She can't take a hint, can she?
F	JOLENE	Who's Celia Foote?
F	HILLY	That tacky girl Johnny married.
F	ELIZABETH	Girl? I heard she's twenty-eight.
F	JOLENE	Oh my God!
F	HILLY	Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. All the girls laugh.
F	SKEETER	Could have been you, Hilly.
F	HILLY	And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit.
F	SKEETER	Aren't we taking non-members? The benefit's gotten so big.
F	HILLY	Yes, but we're not telling her. Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of
F	SKEETER	Thank you, Aibileen. Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point.
F	ELIZABETH	Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use the bathroom.
F	HILLY	Ah-hem. I'm fine. Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	She's upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath, and so do we. Elizabeth turns to Aibileen.
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley. Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Just go use mine and Raleigh's. Hilly hiss-whispers.
F	HILLY	If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too. Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops.
F	HILLY	Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a
F	SKEETER	Did y'all see the cover of "Life" this week? Jackie's never looked
F	HILLY	-Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her
F	ELIZABETH	I can't ask Raleigh until tax season. But, it would be nice.
F	HILLY	That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative. "The Home"...the what?!
F	HILLY	As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet.
F	SKEETER	Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly. The room grows eerily quiet.
F	HILLY	You ought not to joke about the colored situation. Hilly leans in toward Skeeter.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and
F	JOLENE	I have to skedaddle! Gotta get over to the station! Daddy's letting me do the weather tonight!
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband,
M	JOHNNY	Roses look like weeds next to you. Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully.
F	CELIA	Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me! Johnny begins kissing her neck.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	You're home early. Celia pushes him back.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	Johnny, I can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back.
M	JOHNNY	Oh, who cares, honey. We got all we need right here. Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass.
F	CELIA	Johnny, honestly!
M	JOHNNY	Doctor's orders. Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy
F	CELIA	I don't know what's taking us so long. I'm sorry. Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.
M	JOHNNY	Hey, we've never done it in the yard. Maybe that's the trick. Celia seductively bites her lower lip.
F	CELIA	Watch my hair. Johnny's hand slides up her thigh. Aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups.
F	SKEETER	Aibileen? Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am.
F	SKEETER	I had hoped to ask you myself if you could help me with the "Miss Myrna" letters...
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am.
F	SKEETER	So...Would you help me? Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street.
F	AIBILEEN	Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta times. Be good to get it right.
F	SKEETER	Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on splitting the pay with you, too. Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Listen...all that talk in there today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm sorry you had to hear that. Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Is that Preacher Green's sermon on the radio?
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am, it is.
F	SKEETER	That reminds me so much of my maid growing up. Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.
F	AIBILEEN	Constantine and me...were in church circle together.
F	SKEETER	She loved me like you love Mae Mobley.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am. Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen.
F	SKEETER	Aibileen? How could she just quit like that? Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...
F	AIBILEEN	Quit?
F	SKEETER	Yes. When I got home from school last week, Momma said she had quit. Back in March to go live with her people up in Chicago. She didn't leave me a note or anything. Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Could you do that to Mae Mobley? Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.
F	AIBILEEN	No, ma'am. I couldn't...
F	SKEETER	Do you have an address for her or anything? Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in.
F	ELIZABETH	I'm sorry. Did I interrupt something? Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hilly wants this put in the League newsletter. Skeeter nods.
F	SKEETER	Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten tomorrow to get started on Miss Myrna. Elizabeth looks at Aibileen.
F	ELIZABETH	Tomorrow is silver polishing day, so y'all make it quick, okay?
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	I knew I had said too much to Miss Skeeter, but Constantine's story weren't mine to tell. Some things a girl shouldn't have to know about her own mother. Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of Skeeter slowly turns down the old road. Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home. Past intruders have long since taken anything of value. Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE. Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a
F	SKEETER	Hey, Jameso.
M	JAMESO	Hello, Miss Eugenia.
F	SKEETER	Momma! If the Smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect
F	SKEETER	Momma? Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50, Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored,
F	CHARLOTTE	Is this a little too young?
F	SKEETER	It's a little too everything.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Much better.
F	CHARLOTTE	Your daddy bought me this dress in
F	SKEETER	Mom, I want to ask you about
F	CHARLOTTE	-Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl. Charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Come on, you try it on.
F	SKEETER	What really happened? Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.
F	CHARLOTTE	I told you...she went to live with her people in Chicago...Now, Skeeter, your mother is dying, and she wants to see you in this dress. Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress.
F	SKEETER	How could she just take off without telling me?
F	CHARLOTTE	I told her not to write you. I didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. Honey, we were just a job to her. With them it's all about money...Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals.
F	SKEETER	Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow." She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.
F	CHARLOTTE	This looks precious on you! Four years ago my daughter went off to college, and what did she come home with?
M	SKEETER CHARLOTTE	A diploma. A pretty piece of paper.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Hilly and Elizabeth have such lovely children.
F	SKEETER	They dropped out of college to become housewives, Mother.
F	CHARLOTTE	If only you'd show a little gumption, Eugenia...
F	SKEETER	Well, I did get a job today.
F	CHARLOTTE	You did?
F	SKEETER	Writing...for The Jackson Journal. Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind.
F	CHARLOTTE	Great. You can write my obituary. "Charlotte Phelan dead. Her daughter still single."
F	SKEETER	Momma, would it really be so terrible if I never met a husband? With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a
F	CHARLOTTE	I need to...ask you something, Skeeter. I read the other day about how some girls...get unbalanced, start thinking these...well, unnatural thoughts. Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Are you...do you...find men attractive? Are you having unnatural thoughts about... Charlotte shuts her eyes tight. Girls or...or women?
F	SKEETER	Oh my God!
F	CHARLOTTE	Because, this article says there's a cure, a special root tea. Skeeter jumps up.
F	SKEETER	Mother, I want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with Jameso.
F	CHARLOTTE	Eugenia! Skeeter storms out of the room. Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner. Try to look presentable! Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60.
M	CARLTON	What the hell do you know about cleaning a house, Skeeter?
F	SKEETER	It's a start, Carlton. I thought you wanted to write books.
M	ROBERT	Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm proud of you, Sweetheart. Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon.
F	CHARLOTTE	Oh, the irony of it all. Givin' advice on how to keep up a home when she... Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth.
F	SKEETER	Oh! No, Pascagolua! You couldn't have known this...But, see, I'm allergic to almonds.
M	PASCAGOLUA	Sorry, Miss Eugenia.
F	SKEETER	Last time I had an almond, I stopped liking men. Charlotte glares at Skeeter. Carlton lets out a chuckle.
F	REBECCA	Oh my Lord.
F	SKEETER	It's okay, Rebecca. They have a special root tea now.
F	CHARLOTTE	You have pushed it, Young Lady! Pascagolua scurries off. Skeeter turns to her father...
F	SKEETER	Daddy, what happened to Constantine? The room grows silent. Carlton looks down to his plate.
M	ROBERT	Ah...well, Constantine went to live with her family. People move on, Skeeter. But I do wish she'd stayed down here with us.
F	SKEETER	I don't believe you. Skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Mother, did you...fire her?
F	CHARLOTTE	You wouldn't understand. Not until you've hired help of your own.
F	SKEETER	She raised me! Charlotte slaps the table and stands.
M	SHE DID NOT!	Skeeter's eyes fill with tears...
F	SKEETER	She worked here for twenty-nine years. Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.
F	CHARLOTTE	It was a colored thing, and I've put it behind me. Charlotte passes behind Rebecca and kisses her head.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Excuse me, Rebecca. My daughter has upset my cancerous ulcers. As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like Skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer.
F	SKEETER	Good luck down there, Carlton.
M	CARLTON	Have fun at the dance, Skeeter Legs. Robert and Carlton race outside as Charlotte enters, healthy
F	CHARLOTTE	Eugenia! You've grown another inch since breakfast. Go put on a dress that fits before that boy and his daddy come pick you up. A horn blows. Charlotte kisses Skeeter on the cheek and then
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Pray Carlton doesn't like LSU, Constantine. It's so far. It might be the last we see of him. The horn blows again. Charlotte is out the door.
F	CONSTANTINE	Gone be just you and me all weekend.
F	SKEETER	I just couldn't tell her I didn't get asked to the dance.
F	CONSTANTINE	Some things we should just keep to ourselves. Skeeter looks down to her long, bony legs.
F	SKEETER	I'm already taller than the boys' basketball coach. How tall are you, Constantine?
F	CONSTANTINE	I'm five-thirteen, so quit feeling sorry for yourself.
F	SKEETER	Momma was third runner up in the Miss South Carolina pageant.
F	CONSTANTINE	"Miss" what? Shoot, Child! You gone be "Miss Something Better." Constantine grabs Skeeter's hand and presses her thumb firmly Now you listen. Your momma didn't pick her life. It pick her, and she done even know it. You gone do something big with yours. Bigger than your momma or your brother. Constantine lets go of Skeeter's palm and wipes a tear from
F	SKEETER	What about you? What did you want to be, Constantine? Constantine laughs.
F	CONSTANTINE	Oh, Child! We don't get to pick. This pick us, and that just how it is. Tight on Skeeter's face as Constantine gives her a big hug. A sudden revelation washes over her. In a flash, Skeeter is Jolene French attempts to deliver the weather on WLBT.
F	JOLENE	Sunny skies and a high of ninety- eight today with ninety-nine percent humidity. There's a slight chance of afternoon showers so y'all carry an umbrella. Jolene pivots to camera, lowers her chin and smiles.
F	MISS STEIN	What gave you this idea, Miss Phelan? I'm...curious.
F	SKEETER	I was...well, I was raised by a colored woman. I've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help.
F	MISS STEIN	Continue.
F	SKEETER	I'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house. Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up.
F	MISS STEIN	I'm listening.
F	SKEETER	Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked Mammy how she felt about it. There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here.
F	MISS STEIN	So, a side to this never before heard.
F	SKEETER	Yes! Charlotte knocks on the pantry door.
M	CHARLOTTE (O.C.)	Skeeter, who are you talking to in there? Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door.
F	SKEETER	Go! Away! Skeeter slams the door.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	So, yes, their side of the story. Skeeter leans back against the shelves.
F	MISS STEIN	Who was that?
F	SKEETER	My mother. She just dropped by to-
F	MISS STEIN	Look, no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth. That's a hell of a risk in a place like Jackson, Mississippi. I watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news. Oy! They jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail built for four. Skeeter panics.
F	SKEETER	I already have a maid. Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss
F	MISS STEIN	Really? A negro maid has already agreed to talk to you? Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now.
F	SKEETER	Yes, ma'am...
F	MISS STEIN	Well...I suppose I could read what you come up with. The book biz could use a little rattling.
F	SKEETER	You'd do that?
F	MISS STEIN	I'm saying I'll let you know if it's even worth pursuing.
F	SKEETER	Oh, thank you, Miss Stein!
F	MISS STEIN	And for God's sake, you're a twenty- four-year-old educated woman. Go get an apartment. She hangs up.
F	SKEETER	"Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too..."
F	AIBILEEN	Which one she want a get rid of? Them rings or the husband? Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak. Then let it set in the sun a bit. Skeeter writes this down.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Bout an hour. Let it dry. Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside. A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans.
F	HILLY	Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage. The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Oh, mercy! Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the
F	SKEETER	Aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things? Aibileen turns slowly from the window.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	I mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to. Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.
F	AIBILEEN	Everthing's fine.
F	SKEETER	My momma fired Constantine. Thank you for telling me that.
F	AIBILEEN	I never tolt you that! Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.
F	SKEETER	Aibileen, I have an idea...Something I want to write about...But I need your help. Skeeter rises. I want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid. Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of I'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. Show what it's like to work for, say...Elizabeth. Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady
F	AIBILEEN	You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin' stories on her?
F	SKEETER	I was thinking we wouldn't tell her. The other maids will have to keep it secret, too.
F	AIBILEEN	Other maids?
F	SKEETER	I was hoping to get four or five. To really show what it's like in Jackson. To see what y'all get paid, the babies, the bathrooms, the good and the bad. Aibileen shakes her head.
F	AIBILEEN	They set my cousin Shinelle's car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station.
F	SKEETER	A book has never been written like this, Aibileen.
F	AIBILEEN	`Cause they's a reason. I do this with you, I might as well burn my own house down. Bam! The front door slams shut.
M	RALEIGH	I put up with the new clothes and all the damn trips to New Orleans, but this takes the goddamn cake!
F	ELIZABETH	It'll confuse Mae Mobley if she sees Aibileen going inside. And we can't risk her health. Aibileen hears Mae Mobley crying, but she is frozen.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hilly spoke to the Surgeon General! She also said it'll add value to our home! Great! Mae Mobley can just go to college in that bathroom, too.
F	ELIZABETH	Honey, Hilly's covering the cost...and said you can just do William's taxes to pay her back.
M	RALEIGH	We don't take orders from the Holbrooks!
M	RALEIGH	Skeeter? How you doing?
F	SKEETER	Fine.
M	RALEIGH	Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen. Raleigh storms out as Elizabeth charges into the kitchen.
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen, Mae Mobley's crying her eyes out! Aibileen runs off. Elizabeth sees Skeeter and tries to
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Skeeter...Hello. I'm sorry but I think it's best if you leave now. Skeeter gathers her things. And...I don't think this Miss Myrna thing is gonna work out with Aibileen.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	You're making it a lot hotter flapping your arm like that. Minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort. Missus
F	HILLY	That should do it. Minny, go get me and Momma some iced tea. Minny hesitates. She gulps.
F	MINNY	Uh...Miss Hilly?
F	HILLY	Yes.
F	MINNY	Never mind. As Minny turns, Missus Walters calls out to her.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	You go on ahead and use the guest bath, Minny. It's okay.
F	HILLY	Oh, for crying out loud. It's just a little rain. She can go get an umbrella up in William's Study!
M	MISSUS WALTERS	I believe she was working for me before you dragged us both here. Minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair Boom! Another crash of thunder. Large hail stones begin
F	MINNY	I'm gone get your tea. There's a knock on the door. She freezes.
M	HILLY (O.C.)	Minny? Minny panics, staying completely quiet.
F	HILLY	MINNYYYY, are you in there?
F	MINNY	Yes, ma'am...
F	HILLY	Are you sitting down? Minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet. Hilly beats on
M	GET OFF OF MY TOILET!!!	Outside the house, an eerie, groaning sound, much like a The top of a huge tree snaps off and falls against the house,
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day. Ten white. Eight black.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose. Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone. Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast... Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house
F	ELIZABETH	Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up, and I'm off to the doctor. Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley
M	MAE MOBLEY	Aibee bafroom, Momma! Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out.
M	MAE MOBLEY (CONT'D)	Aibee? Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step.
F	ELIZABETH	No!
F	AIBILEEN	Be right there, Baby Girl. Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose. Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in
F	SKEETER	Afternoon, Aibileen. Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Can I talk to you? A bus pulls up.
F	AIBILEEN	You got some "Miss Myrna" questions for me?
F	SKEETER	No. Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Please. Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am. The bus pulls away.
F	SKEETER	Please let me interview you. I know it's scary, but I really believe this has to be done. We'll be careful.
F	AIBILEEN	This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter. You not knowing that is what scares me most. I'm sorry. Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number I know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them. Womens, they ain't like men. Women don`t beat you with a stick. Naw, they like to keep they hands clean. Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails. As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling "Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South"
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment.
F	MINNY	Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it now! Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in town I stole a candelabra! That's why I can't get no job.
F	AIBILEEN	Everbody know you honest, Minny.
F	MINNY	Oh, but I got her back...I did something awful, Aibileen.
F	AIBILEEN	What you did?!
M	MINNY (O.S.)	I cain't tell! I ain't tellin' nobody! I done a terrible awful thing to that woman. And now she knows what I did! Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny. Minny presents Hilly waves Minny inside.
F	MINNY	She got what she deserve, Aibileen. But, now I ain't gone never get no work again...Leroy gone kill me. Minny's husband, LEROY, 40, approaches behind Minny. Minny
F	AIBILEEN	Minny! She can't bear to listen and hangs up the phone. She sees Aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside.
F	SKEETER	I parked way up on State Street and caught a cab here like you asked.
F	AIBILEEN	Got dropped two streets over? Skeeter nods.
F	SKEETER	Aibileen, I now know it's against the law for us to meet like this. Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down. Aibileen self- I've never seen you out of uniform before. You look nice, Aibileen.
F	AIBILEEN	Thank you. Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a A tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I've never had a white person in my house before. Skeeter sips her tea.
F	SKEETER	I've never been in a colored person's home before. I think we're both doing great. This tea is really nice. Aibileen watches as Skeeter takes a bite of the cookie.
F	AIBILEEN	Miss Skeeter, What if...What if you don't like what I got to say? About white peoples?
F	SKEETER	I...this isn't about my opinion. It doesn't matter how I feel.
F	AIBILEEN	You gone have to change my name. Mine, Miss Leefolt's, everbody's.
F	SKEETER	Everybody? So, you know other maids who might be interested? Aibileen is quiet for a moment. She shakes her head.
F	AIBILEEN	It gone be hard.
F	SKEETER	What about Minny?
F	AIBILEEN	Minny got her some stories, sho nuff. But, she ain't real keen on talking to white peoples right now.
F	SKEETER	What does it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home, being...looked after by somebody else?
F	AIBILEEN	It feel...Uh. Aibileen glances up to the framed picture of Treelore.
F	SKEETER	Is that your son?
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am. He dead two years now. Got run over at the lumber yard. Lungs were crushed.
F	SKEETER	I'm so sorry. That's horrible. And, Aibileen, you don't have to call me "ma'am." Not here anyway. Aibileen nods. Skeeter stares at her list of questions.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Do you want to talk about the bathroom? Or, about Elizab--Miss Leefolt? Anything about the way she pays you? Has she ever yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley? Aibileen shakes her head.
F	AIBILEEN	I'm sorry, I- Aibileen covers her mouth with her hand. Skeeter becomes
F	SKEETER	No, I am. She pulls out a stack of Miss Myrna letters.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Let's just do a couple of Miss Myrna letters, and I'll run on...
F	AIBILEEN	I thought I might write my stories down and read them to you.
F	SKEETER	Well, sure I guess.
F	AIBILEEN	It no different than writing down my prayers.
F	SKEETER	You don't say your prayers aloud?
F	AIBILEEN	Prayer like electricity. It keep life going. Writing it down make it more powerful. Lot a ailing, sick peoples in this town.
F	SKEETER	I'm sure.
F	AIBILEEN	I didn't get a chance to pray for Treelore. God took him fast `cause he didn't want to argue with me. He was just twenty-four years old. The best part of a person's life.
F	SKEETER	Oh, Aibileen.
F	AIBILEEN	But he'd like we's doing this. He always said we gone have a writer in the family one day...After my prayers last night, I got some stories down too. Skeeter nods. Aibileen opens her notebook and reads.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	My first white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just turned fourteen years old. Daddy had left us, so I dropped out a school to help momma with the bills. Aibileen stands next to Yule May and is whispering in her Minny watches from two pews back. Her curiosity is peaked.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Alton's momma died a lung disease. I loved that baby, and he loved me. That's when I learned I could make children feel proud of theyselves.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Alton used to always be asking me how come I's black...
F	AIBILEEN	It just ate him up, so one time I told him it cause I drank too much coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen his face.
F	SKEETER	This is great. You have no idea how much I appreciate this...But I just have to ask. What changed your mind? Miss Hilly Holbrook.
F	HILLY	We're running behind on our "coat drive," girls. So hurry up and clean out those closets...But our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots. The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Y'all think we can put a dent in the African Children's hunger this year? More applause. Those who aren't pregnant, stand. Hilly
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Now for some exciting news...I wanted y'all to be the first to know...My William is seeking election to the State Senate this November! Now, even the pregnant women stand. Elizabeth grabs
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	He's runnin' on a platform of health. Protecting our children. Protecting our way of life. So, I, with William, have drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative. This sets off a room of whispers. Skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter? I gave it to you a month ago. Everyone turns to Skeeter. Elizabeth panics.
F	ELIZABETH	I gave that to you myself!
F	SKEETER	I, ah...Well, I-
F	HILLY	Would you please stand, Skeeter? As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads.
F	SKEETER	I'll have it in there soon. Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel.
F	SKEETER	Hilly? Do you need a ride? Hilly shakes her head with little emotion.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	I'm sorry about the newsletter. Hilly nods. A soft smile begins to form.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	With Momma being sick and- Hilly erupts with excitement.
F	HILLY	He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's definitely coming this time. This Saturday night.
F	SKEETER	Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice before. Maybe it's a sign.
F	HILLY	Don't you dare say that!
F	SKEETER	You know I won't be his type. Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders.
F	HILLY	It's your time, Skeeter. And damnit, I'm not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him.
F	MINNY	Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like to not feed ya on try-out day. Sugar takes a bite of toast.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	I still say you're too young to be waitin' on white peoples...Now, Sugar, I want you to listen to me, and you listen to me good. Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	These are the rules for working in a white lady's house. Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Rule Number One: Don't you ever let White Lady find you sittin' on her toilet. Sugar nods. Number Two: You keep your nose out of White Lady's problems, and don't cry to her with yours. White people ain't your friends.
M	MINNY (V.O.)	Number Three: When you're cooking white food, taste it with a different spoon. They see you put the tasting spoon back in the pot, might as well throw it all out. Spoon, too.
M	MINNY (V.O.)	Four: You use the same cup, same fork, same plate every day. Minny takes her first step on the stairs.
M	MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Five: Don't hit her kids. White people do they own spanking. Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door.
M	MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Six: No sass-mouthing! Minny knocks. Number six, Minny. Number six. The door flies open. Celia Foote answers. She's covered in
F	CELIA	Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote. Aibileen said you'd be on time. Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola?
F	MINNY	No, thank you. I'm Minny Jackson... You...cooking something?
F	CELIA	One of those upsidedown cakes from the magazine. It ain't workin' out too good. Come on in.
F	MINNY	What in the hell- Minny catches herself. Tuck it in, Minny. Tuck it in.
F	CELIA	I guess I have some learnin' to do. You sure do.
F	CELIA	Johnny's momma wouldn't let me decorate a thing. If I had my way, this house would have wall to wall white carpet with gold trim and none of this old stuff. Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete
F	MINNY	Where you from? Celia lowers her head in shame...
F	CELIA	Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis.
F	MINNY	I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live there. Celia changes the subject.
F	CELIA	Let's go meet Oscar! Celia grabs Minny's hand. Annoyed, Minny pulls it away.
F	CELIA	Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in Montana back in 1910 with Teddy Roosevelt. Celia points to fifteen guns mounted behind Oscar.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	We got five bedrooms and bathrooms here in the main house. The pool house has two more beds and baths.
F	MINNY	When you gone have some chillins, start fillin' up all these beds? Celia swallows hard. She places her hand on her stomach.
F	CELIA	I'm pregnant now. Minny steps back and surveys Celia.
F	MINNY	Gone be eatin' for two. Double the cookin'. Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house.
F	CELIA	I know it's an awful lot to do. Five other maids have already turned me down...Can I at least give you some bus money?
F	MINNY	When you hear me say I don't wanna clean this house?
F	CELIA	What? So...You'll do it?! Before Minny can nod. Celia throws her arms around her.
F	MINNY	No huggin', now. No huggin'.
F	CELIA	I'm sorry. This is my first time hiring a maid.
F	MINNY	We got to talk about some things first. I work Sunday through Friday. Celia bites her pinky nail.
F	CELIA	You can't come at all on weekends.
F	MINNY	Okay. What time you want me here?
F	CELIA	After eight, and you have to leave at four.
F	MINNY	Okay. Now what your husband say you can pay? Celia looks away.
F	CELIA	Johnny doesn't know I'm bringing in help.
F	MINNY	And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he comes home and finds a colored woman up in his kitchen?
F	CELIA	It's not that I'd be fibbing. I just want him to think I can do this on my own...I need some help `til I get the hang of it. I need a maid.
F	MINNY	A course you do. Last one done got shot in the head. Minny sniffs the air.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Miss Celia, I think you done burned up yo cake.
F	CELIA	Oww! Dawgonit! She drops the burnt cake on the floor.
F	MINNY	You can't use no wet towel on a hot pan. Minny grabs a dry towel and picks up the cake.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	I'll take this burnt up cake with me so Mister Johnny don't see it. Aibileen shakes her head. Elizabeth enters the room.
F	ELIZABETH	I'm off, Aibileen. Don't forget Raleigh wants pot roast tonight.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am. Aibileen's eyes narrow.
F	AIBILEEN	I reckon I'm ready...to talk about Miss Leefolt now. Skeeter stops typing and looks up. She nods.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Baby girl don't get her diaper changed `til I get there in the morning. That's `bout ten hours she gots to sit in her mess. I be so worried about her on my day off. I always come in an hour early on Mondays. Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too. And, law, I pray this child turn out good. It a lonely road if a momma don't think theys child is pretty. Charlotte glances down disapprovingly at the dingy, huarache
F	CHARLOTTE	Where are you going, Skeeter? Skeeter turns.
F	SKEETER	Bible study.
F	CHARLOTTE	On a Saturday night?
F	SKEETER	Momma, God doesn't care what day of the week it is. Skeeter walks out the back door as Charlotte shakes her head.
F	AIBILEEN	Miss Leefolt be spending so much time keeping up with the society ladies, she done forgot the child she got now. Just then Minny barges through the kitchen back door.
F	MINNY	Aibileen! Minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of Skeeter.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Yule May told me what y'all up to. Aibileen nods. Minny's face hardens.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Medgar Evers live five minutes away. They blew up his carport last night. For talking! Minny scowls at Skeeter.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	What makes you think colored people need your help? You white. Why you care?
F	AIBILEEN	We all working for the same thing. Maybe you just want to get her in trouble. Skeeter is petrified. Her face reddens.
F	SKEETER	I want to show her perspective...so people might understand what it's like from your side.
F	MINNY	Well it's a real Fourth of July picnic. It's what we dream a doing all weekend long, get back in they house to polish the silver. And we just love not getting minimum wage or Social Security.
F	SKEETER	I know, Minny. Maybe things might
F	MINNY	What law's gonna say you gotta be nice to your maid? And another thing, I don't want my children going to school with white kids. And I don't care a thing about votin.' Only thing black mens get elected to is Deacon of the church.
F	AIBILEEN	You don't have to do this, Minny.
F	MINNY	You damn right I don't! You two givin' me the heart palpitations. Minny storms out the back door. Skeeter looks like she might
F	AIBILEEN	And that was a good mood. Minny immediately storms back in the kitchen.
F	MINNY	All right...I'm gone do it. I just want to make sure you know this ain't no game we're playing here. Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle Slide your chair out from under that table and face me. I want to see you square on at all times. Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table and
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	I's got to come up with your questions, too?!
F	SKEETER	Let's begin...begin with...with where you were born. Aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing.
F	MINNY	Belzoni, Mississippi on my great- auntie's sofa. Next!
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Once Minny got to talking `bout food, she liked to never stop...
F	MINNY	I put the green beans in first, then I go on and get the pork chops going cause, mmm-mmm, I like my chops hot out the pan. Just as Aibileen fills the first notebook, Skeeter hands her But when she got to talking about the white ladies, it took all night...
F	MINNY	"Oh, Minny, I'm gone give you a week paid vacation." Now, I ain't had no paid vacation in my life. A week later, I come back and they'd moved to Mobile. "Miss Lazy Fingers" scared I'd find a new job before she moved... Minny spins around to Aibileen with sudden realization...
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	We gots to get more maids! Minny stands. Skeeter's eyes widen with hope.
F	AIBILEEN	I know, but it hard, Minny. Mind racing, Minny flies out the door without a word. You gone and done it now.
F	MISS STEIN	I like this "Sarah Ross." She can kvetch but not complain too much.
F	MISS STEIN	And this "Bertha"...she's got chutzpah. I'll give her that.
F	SKEETER	So...you liked it?
F	MISS STEIN	Eugenia, Martin Luther King just invited the country to march with him in D.C. this August. This many negroes and whites haven't worked together since "Gone with the Wind."
F	SKEETER	Does this mean you'll publish it?
F	MISS STEIN	I never said that. My advice is to write it fast before this civil rights thing blows over. I need it by New Year's, and don't send me anything more until you have twelve maids.
F	SKEETER	Twelve?
F	MISS STEIN	At least.
F	MINNY	Aibileen and I done asked everbody we know. Thirty-one maids. Everbody too scared, think we crazy...
F	SKEETER	Then we might as well stop!
F	MINNY	I got plenty a stories, Miss Skeeter. Just write`em down and invent a maid that said it. We already making up everbody's name. Make up the maids, too. Skeeter jumps up from her chair.
F	SKEETER	We can't do that! Aibileen and Minny lean back. I mean...I would never do that. It wouldn't be real. It's wrong.
F	AIBILEEN	Don't give up on us, Miss Skeeter. Skeeter softens and sits back down.
F	SKEETER	I'm sorry. Thank you both for trying.
F	MINNY	What can you cook? Minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash, then drops them in
F	CELIA	I can cook corn pone, boil potatoes, and do grits. Minny bursts out laughing.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	We didn't have electric current where I was raised.
F	MINNY	Well, I reckon if there's anything you ought to know `bout cooking... Minny holds up a can of Crisco. It's this. The most important invention since they put mayonnaise in a jar. You don't even know the things you can do with this here can. Celia peers into the skillet as Minny spoons out a mound of
F	CELIA	How pretty. Looks like frosting. Minny rolls her eyes and hands Celia the bag of Chicken.
F	MINNY	Shake that. Celia starts shaking the bag.
F	CELIA	This is fun!
F	CELIA	Looks so good! I'm starved. Aggravated, Minny stands.
F	MINNY	You supposed to eat in the dining room, Miss Celia. That how it works. Minny grabs Celia's plate.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Here, I'll take your plate in the dinin' room for ya. Want tea?
F	CELIA	I'm fine right here, Minny. Minny sits back down with a sigh. Celia touches her arm.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	I'm real grateful you're here.
F	MINNY	Miss Celia, you got a lot more to be grateful for than me. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway. Minny panics.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Mister Johnny?!
F	CELIA	Oh, no! Hide! Minny slides down underneath the kitchen table.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	Oh...It's just the florist. Johnny must have sent me flowers. Minny pulls herself up off the floor. She's mad.
F	MINNY	Miss Celia, I ain't playin' around no more! He gone catch me here and shoot me dead right here on this no- wax floor! You gots to tell him. Ain't he wondering how the cooking so good?
M	CELIA FOOTE	You're right. Maybe we ought to burn the chicken a little. The doorbell rings. Celia runs off to answer.
F	MINNY	Minny don't burn chicken.
F	CHARLOTTE	This is bound to work, Sweetie. It even smells expensive. She begins twisting Skeeter's hair into gooey spikes.
F	SKEETER	I feel the hope in your fingers. Skeeter resembles a papier maché starfish.
F	CHARLOTTE	How can you not know his last name?
F	SKEETER	He's William's cousin. That's all I know.
F	CHARLOTTE	That's just so sweet of Hilly. Charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette, then lifts up a
F	SKEETER	What is that?!
F	CHARLOTTE	The Shinolator! It cost eleven dollars. I'm a good mother. Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	"The Miracle Straitening Cap" must remain on the head for two hours."
F	SKEETER	Two hours?! Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine
F	CHARLOTTE	I'll have Pascagoula bring you a magazine. Skeeter snatches her mother's cigarette and takes a drag.
F	SKEETER	Thanks, Constantine. Do you think this dress is cute? Skeeter holds the magazine up to Pascagoula. Only now does
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula. Pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns.
M	PASCAGOLUA	I knew Constantine. She was a mighty fine woman.
F	SKEETER	Holy shit.
F	CHARLOTTE	You've shrunk five inches. You'll be able to wear heels tonight. Charlotte looks down to the huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet You're not leaving this house in those awful, Mexican, man shoes. Charlotte pulls out a dress and pair of heels.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	What time is he picking you up?
F	SKEETER	He's meeting me at Hilly's. Can I take the Cadillac?
F	CHARLOTTE	We promised Carlton the Cadillac tonight. So, William's cousin will just have to come get you himself.
F	SKEETER	I'll take the truck.
F	CHARLOTTE	It's hooked to the motor grader.
F	SKEETER	I'll drive slow.
F	CHARLOTTE	Don't mope. Remember to smile! Skeeter floors it. Charlotte runs faster.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	And, don't sit like some squaw Indian. Cross! Your! Ankles! Skeeter leaves her mother in a cloud of dust. I love you! A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When
M	WILLIAM	With your daddy's endorsement, I can win that Senate seat. Stuart feigns interest.
M	STUART	I'll talk to him. Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink.
F	SKEETER	Hey. As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand.
F	HILLY	Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk about quarterbacks or something. Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca Cola. Yule May runs off. Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall.
F	HILLY	Skeeter, you don't even have on lipstick! Skeeter dabs her armpits.
F	SKEETER	It was so goddamn awful. I hit a cat. Hilly sprays Final Net.
F	HILLY	Well...What do you think of him? Skeeter applies lipstick. Hilly removes the rollers.
F	SKEETER	He looks handsome. Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	All right, give it to me. One to ten? Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back.
F	HILLY	Seven.
F	SKEETER	Really?! Seven? Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal.
F	HILLY	Honey, you're beautiful. Just go on out there...you're gonna do great. It's your time, Skeeter. I just know it. Hilly hugs Skeeter.
M	STUART	You want a drink?
F	SKEETER	Just water, please. Double Old Kentucky straight...with a water back...Make that two backs.
F	SKEETER	THANKS?! So...you went to Alabama? Stuart nods. Hilly rolls her eyes.
F	HILLY	"Roll Tide." We still love him. Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek.
F	SKEETER	Now you're in the oil business. Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.
M	STUART	The money's good. If that's what you really want to know.
F	SKEETER	That's not what I- Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green
M	STUART	Isn't that your old boyfriend, Hilly? Johnny Foote? Hilly scowls.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter than Delta asphalt. Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave.
F	HILLY	William! The Lieutenant Governor just walked in. Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns
M	STUART	So, what do you do with your time?
F	SKEETER	I write a...a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal. Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.
M	STUART	You mean housekeeping? Skeeter nods and grabs her water. Jesus, I can't think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column. Except maybe writing one.
F	HILLY	We'd love your support on election day! Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens.
M	JOHNNY	Hilly, you look lovely tonight.
F	HILLY	Thank you, Johnny.
M	JOHNNY	William, have you ever met Celia? William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand.
M	WILLIAM	Nice to meet you. Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm.
F	HILLY	Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners. Celia musters up all the courage inside her.
M	CELIA FOOTE	Hilly, did you ever get the messages that I've been calling you?
F	HILLY	I did not.
M	CELIA FOOTE	Well, I would love to help with the benefit. I have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed.
F	HILLY	"Save the dates" were mailed weeks ago...You didn't get one? Celia shakes her head.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh? Now, come on, before they run out of Trout Almondine. Hilly pulls William away. Johnny grabs Celia's hand.
M	STUART	Sounds like a ploy to find a husband...becoming an expert on keeping house.
F	SKEETER	Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme. Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit.
F	HILLY	What'd we miss?
M	STUART	Isn't that what you women from Ole Miss major in? Professional husband hunting?
F	SKEETER	I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant? Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate
F	HILLY	Who? Is? Hungry? Skeeter stands.
F	SKEETER	Not me! A kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince.' Tables begin to stare.
M	STUART	Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart! As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into
F	HILLY	Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower.
M	YULE MAY	Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you and Mister William something. Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching
M	YULE MAY (CONT'D)	My twin boys finished high school, both on the honor roll...My husband and I have been saving for years to send them to college.
F	HILLY	Okay... Only now does William lower his paper.
M	YULE MAY	We are short seventy-five dollars on one of the tuitions. William stands up, kisses Hilly on the cheek.
M	WILLIAM	Well, I'm late. Gotta go. William leaves.
F	HILLY	Go on...
M	YULE MAY	Now...We're faced with having to choose. Which son gets to go...if we don't find all the money. Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May.
M	YULE MAY (CONT'D)	Would you consider givin' us a loan? I'll...I'll work for free until it's paid off.
F	HILLY	That's not working for free, Yule May. That's paying off a debt.
M	YULE MAY	Yes, ma'am.
F	HILLY	As a Christian, I'm going to do you a favor. Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms. God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able. You need to come up with this money on your own. You'll thank me one day. Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits. White women smile and chat with one another as they meander
F	MINNY	That's her. Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Lord, she's trying to shop. Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the Thanks, Doll!
F	MINNY	Miss Celia just don't see `em. The lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly, nobody. Aibileen just nods.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	What you so quiet for? I know you got a opinion `bout all this.
F	AIBILEEN	You gone accuse me a philosophizing.
F	MINNY	I ain't afraid a no philosophy.
F	AIBILEEN	I don't believe in lines anymore. Lines is in our heads `cause people like Miss Hilly try to make us believe they there. Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.
F	MINNY	Oh, they there. I know. I get punished for crossing them.
F	AIBILEEN	Lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband, you crossed a line...need to be punished.
F	MINNY	You know I ain't studying no line like that.
F	AIBILEEN	Cause it ain't there. `Cept in Leroy's head. Lines between black and white ain't there either. Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her
F	MINNY	So, I ain't crossing no line if I tell Miss Celia she ain't good enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?
F	AIBILEEN	All I'm saying is kindness don't have no boundaries. Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Law, the Evers children have gotten so big! Cause they happy. Myrlie got her a good man...And you better not try to say they ain't no line between her Medgar and my Leroy.
F	AIBILEEN	No. You got me. A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks
M	MAE MOBLEY	Mae Mo hungry, Momma. Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.
F	ELIZABETH	She's always hungry. All the women laugh except for Skeeter.
F	SKEETER	You know she can hear you, Elizabeth? Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the
F	AIBILEEN	I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen, we gave that scraper to Hilly and William for their wedding present. Chantilly!
F	AIBILEEN	It so pretty. Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.
F	HILLY	Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's? Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at Nice to have your own, isn't it?
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am.
F	HILLY	Separate but equal. That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the Governor.
F	SKEETER	Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of modern day government. Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.
F	HILLY	Aibileen, did you know that me and Mister Holbrook arranged for that bathroom? Sent the boys over and the equipment, too. Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am...And I thank you. Hilly smiles and nods.
F	HILLY	Well...You. Are. Welcome. Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into One thing I got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children. Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss. Hilly kisses her son gently.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And, law, do they love her back. When she starts up on me, I just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me. That kind a love makes me cry. Even when it going to Miss Hilly. Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically
M	YULE MAY	May I get you something?
F	SKEETER	No, thanks... Yule May, I wanted to talk to you. Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still
M	YULE MAY	I know what you want to ask, Miss Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny already did. Yule May closes the kitchen door.
M	YULE MAY (CONT'D)	I'm trying to get my boys off to college. It's worthwhile what y'all doing, but my boys are worth more.
F	SKEETER	I understand. What do you "understand," Skeeter? Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the
F	SKEETER	Ah...Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college.
F	HILLY	Is that true, Yule May?
M	YULE MAY	Yes, Ma'am. Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow
F	HILLY	Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money?
F	SKEETER	Of course not, Hilly! Hilly approaches Skeeter.
F	HILLY	Skeeter, I'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter. Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen.
F	SKEETER	Not at all. I'm just so busy right now with Mom.
F	HILLY	Skeeter...I'm sorry about your mother. And I know you must be so worried. Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	But I'm worried about you. All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff?
F	SKEETER	My dad had me get that for him.
F	HILLY	I mean, around your friends is one thing...But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with this...you'd be in serious trouble. Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly.
F	SKEETER	Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for going through my things. Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over.
F	CHARLOTTE	Skeeter!
F	SKEETER	What?!
F	CHARLOTTE	Don't panic, but there's a very tall man named Stuart here for you.
F	SKEETER	He's a drunken asshole, Mother. You wouldn't like him. Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet.
F	CHARLOTTE	Skeeter, love and hate are two horns on the same goat. And, you need a goat! Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red
F	CHARLOTTE	Stuart, would you like a cocktail? Skeeter shoots her mother a "What the..." look.
M	STUART	No, Ma'am. Little too early.
F	SKEETER	Ha! Charlotte moves on.
F	CHARLOTTE	What's your last name, Stuart?
M	STUART	Whitworth.
F	CHARLOTTE	Hmm...Where are you from?
M	STUART	Natchez.
F	CHARLOTTE	Really? Well, I know a Whitworth from Natchez...But he's a Senator up in Washington.
M	STUART	Yes, Ma'am. That's my daddy.
F	CHARLOTTE	Who is?
M	STUART	Senator Whitworth. That's my father. Charlotte's jaw drops to her string of pearls.
F	CHARLOTTE	Really? Stuart nods. Charlotte stands, flustered yet joyful.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	Well...tell him I said "Hello"...I'm going to go see if Pascagoula needs some help in the kitchen. Charlotte backs away behind Stuart's chair. She points at
M	STUART	Look. I know it was a few weeks back, but I came here to say I'm sorry for the way I acted.
F	SKEETER	Who sent you? William or Hilly?
M	STUART	Neither. I was rude, and I've been thinking about it a lot.
F	SKEETER	Well, I haven't. So, just go.
M	STUART	Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on any date. I wasn't even close to ready. Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	I was engaged last year. She ended it. Skeeter refuses to pity him. We'd been dating since we were fifteen. You know how it is.
F	SKEETER	Actually, I don't. I've never dated anyone before. Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.
M	STUART	Well! That must be it then.
F	SKEETER	What?
M	STUART	I've never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking.
F	SKEETER	I've got plenty to say...
M	STUART	Would you like to...come downtown with me and have dinner? We could talk... We could listen to each other this time.
F	SKEETER	I can't think of anything worse. Stuart looks down and nods.
M	STUART	Then, I'm sorry. That's what I came to say and...I said it. Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously
F	SKEETER	Just give me a minute! Stuart turns.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Let me get my sweater.
M	STUART	What do you want, Skeeter?
F	SKEETER	I'll have a Co-cola. Lots of ice.
M	STUART	No, I mean in life. What do you want? Only now does Skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter
F	SKEETER	I want to be a journalist. Maybe a novelist. Maybe both.
M	STUART	I like that...I've been thinking about you. You're smart, you're pretty, you're...tall!
F	SKEETER	Pretty?
M	STUART	Yes. And I read your column. Very informative. I never knew Crisco got rid of diaper rash. Skeeter laughs and slaps him playfully. I hope you get to write something really good, Skeeter. Something you believe in. Stuart suddenly leans over and kisses Skeeter.
F	AIBILEEN	Baby girl home.
M	ELIZABETH (O.C.)	Aibileen! My trunk's full! Aibileen rises slowly, placing a hand on her knee. Outside,
M	ELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT'D)	Mae Mobley! No! Stop! Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Me and Aibiee bafroom, Momma. Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her
F	ELIZABETH	It! Is! Not! Mae Mobley begins to cry. Aibileen watches as Elizabeth hiss-
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	This is dirty out here! You'll catch diseases. Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs.
M	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	No! No! No!
F	AIBILEEN	I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here. Aibileen kisses her on the cheek.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	You is kind. You is smart. You is important...You want me to tell you one a our secret stories? Mae Mobley nods. The phone rings. Aibileen rises.
M	ELIZABETH (O.C.)	I got it!
F	AIBILEEN	One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Martian? How big?
F	AIBILEEN	Oh, he about six-two.
M	MAE MOBLEY	What's his name?
F	AIBILEEN	Martian Luther King.
M	MAE MOBLEY	What did he look like?
F	AIBILEEN	Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head. But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Why Aibee? Why was they so mean?
F	AIBILEEN	`Cause he was green. Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room.
F	ELIZABETH	Aibileen! Come on! We have to go help Hilly. Now! Come on! Elizabeth runs outside. Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley. A stream of people walk toward them, laughing.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Look! Look, Aibee. Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of
F	HILLY	Get out of here! Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Skeeter! She put it in the newsletter. I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house. Not commodes! Hilly faces the toilets again and screams.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Go help those boys GET THOSE
M	DRIVER	Y'all stay put. Let me find out what's going on. As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by The driver returns. The young black man speaks up.
M	YOUNG BLACK MAN	What happen up there, Mister?
M	DRIVER	Colored people off. White people lemme know where y'all are going. I'll get you as close as I can.
M	WHITE PASSENGER	What's going on? Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs.
M	DRIVER	I don't know. Some nigger got shot. Where you headed? The bus door shuts and the driver backs away.
M	YOUNG BLACK MAN	You all right? You close to home?
F	AIBILEEN	I be all right. My house is seven blocks from here.
M	YOUNG BLACK MAN	Want me to walk you?
F	AIBILEEN	Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law, I hope this ain't as bad as- Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch Aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor.
F	MINNY	Aibileen! You okay? Aibileen nods, trying to compose herself. Almost ten years serving as the Field Secretary for the NAACP...Medgar Evers is dead. Aibileen swallows hard.
F	MINNY	KKK shot him! Hour ago. Right in front a his children, Aibileen.
F	AIBILEEN	We gone pray for the Evers. We gone pray for Myrlie. Minny raises her fists.
F	MINNY	We living in hell! We trapped. Our kids is trapped. Minny turns to Sugar.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Take your brother and sister and go get in my bed. Stay there! Sugar leads the kids to the back of the house.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	What they gone do to us if they catch us with Miss Skeeter?
F	AIBILEEN	We gone be careful.
F	MINNY	Hitch us to a pickup and drag us behind? Shoot me front a my kids?
F	AIBILEEN	We ain't doing civil rights with Miss Skeeter. We just tellin' stories like they really happen. Minny and Aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard.
F	MINNY	You a fool, old woman. A fool! Aibileen hugs Minny. I can't believe I'm on say this... But, I actually wish Leroy was home right now. Aibileen and Minny laugh a little through the tears.
M	CLOSE ON PAPER:	A picture shows Hilly standing among the fifty toilets in her "Come on by, have a seat!" Home of William and Hilly Holbrook, Jackson, Mississippi. Much love, Stuart.
F	HILLY	You are sick. Do not speak to me. Do not look at me. Don't say hello to my children. How long had you been planning to humiliate my family?
F	SKEETER	That's not it, Hilly.
F	HILLY	You thought you were so clever, didn't ya? But I've already installed three of those old toilets in people's garages.
F	SKEETER	Technically, it was a typo, Hilly.
F	HILLY	I intend to tell Stuart he's ruining his reputation by associating with you. Jolene's yard boy saw you hanging around the colored bus stop.
F	SKEETER	I wasn't hanging-
F	HILLY	I guess your car was in the shop? Skeeter looks away.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	You know as well as I do, people won't buy so much as a slice of pound cake from an organization that harbors racial integrationists! Skeeter steps forward.
F	SKEETER	Hilly, just who is that pound cake money being raised for, anyway? Hilly rolls her eyes.
F	HILLY	"The Starving Children of Africa." Skeeter nods and walks away. Hilly shouts out.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton has taken your seat at bridge club.
F	MINNY	Miss Celia?
F	MINNY	Miss Celia, you in here? Minny hears running water and muffled crying behind the
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Hello? You sick? Minny twists the knob. It's locked.
M	CELIA (O.C.)	I'm fine. Minny. Go on home for the day.
F	MINNY	You mess up your hair coloring again? I helped you fix it last time, got it back real pretty.
M	CELIA (O.C.)	I said go home, Minny! Minny sees water creeping out from under the door. She steps
F	MINNY	Miss Celia! Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth.
F	CELIA	There's so much blood. Why is there so much blood this time? Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	Please, Minny. Will you get it out? I can't look at it again. Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can. She puts her hand on
F	MINNY	Keep your head down.
M	CELIA'S POV:	The two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn.
M	DOCTOR	Give her another pill if she gets too agitated. There'll be more bleeding, but don't call me unless it's heavy. Minny nods as the doctor leaves.
F	CELIA	We got married because I was pregnant. But it slipped out too.
F	MINNY	That's just God's way. Next one's gonna catch.
F	CELIA	Johnny wants kids now. I thought if I was real still, brought somebody in to do the house and cooking, maybe I'd hold on to this one. Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do with me?
F	MINNY	He gone have to get over this. He needs to know this takes time.
F	CELIA	He doesn't know about this one, or the one before... Minny turns to Celia, stunned by this revelation.
M	CELIA FOOTE	Minny, you know how to play bridge, don't you? Minny nods.
F	MINNY	Yes, ma'am. I used to help Missus Walters practice.
F	AIBILEEN	Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two today! Mae Mobley laughs as Aibileen sets down the grits.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Mae Mobley three!
F	AIBILEEN	You sure is, Baby Girl. Blow'em out `fo they run up in your grits. Mae Mobley blows out the candles.
M	MAE MOBLEY	How old are you, Aibiee?
F	AIBILEEN	Fifty-three.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Do you get burfdays?
F	AIBILEEN	Gone be fifty-four next week.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Do you have some babies?
F	AIBILEEN	I gots seventeen of `em.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Where are the babies?
F	AIBILEEN	They all over town.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Aibee...You're my real mama.
F	AIBILEEN	Now, you know who your momma is.
M	MAE MOBLEY	I'm your real baby, Aibee. Those other ones are just pretend. Minny lays down one of her cards then looks over to Celia's She removes a card from Celia's and lays it down. She then
F	HILLY	Okay. First order of business. We're updating our newsletter. Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back. We're adding a fashion column with all the latest trends...Your dresses better be cute at next week's benefit! The women applaud and tap each other on their thighs.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Now it's time to choose a new editor for our new modern monthly. Skeeter braces herself as hands pop up everywhere. Jolene
M	JOLENE FRENCH	I nominate Hilly Holbrook. Jolene looks back and snarls at Skeeter.
F	HILLY	Jolene, you're the sweetest thing!
M	OTHER MEMBERS	I second. I third. All in favor of Hilly, say "Aye." The room erupts.
M	MEMBERS	Aye! Skeeter's ousting took less than ten seconds. Elizabeth I'm so sorry.
F	CHARLOTTE	Honey, would you like me to drop you off at bridge club on the way to my doctor's appointment? No, Ma'am. It's been cancelled. Mae Mobley's sick or something. Elizabeth, Hilly, Jolene and several other girls giggle as
F	AIBILEEN	Everything okay? Elizabeth looks back. Her belly is huge.
F	ELIZABETH	Shhh! There's a knock at door.
M	CELIA (O.C.)	Elizabeth, it's me, Celia Foote. I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by. The girls giggle more loudly now. Celia peers into the The bridge tables are in plain view. Celia's face grows
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	I...brought you a chocolate pie...My maid, Minny, made it. Hilly's face hardens... Celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie.
F	CELIA	They made me stand there like the vacuum man. Why, Minny? Minny freezes, keeping her face on the peas.
F	MINNY	Because they know about you getting knocked up by Mister Johnny. They mad you married one a they mens. Especially since Mister Johnny and Miss Hilly had just broke up, too.
F	CELIA	So, Hilly probably thinks I was fooling around with Johnny while they were still going steady. Missus Walters says Miss Hilly still sweet on Mister Johnny, too. Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement.
F	CELIA	No wonder! They don't hate me...They hate what they think I did!
F	MINNY	They hate you cause they think you're white trash! And don't be takin' pies to those women!
F	CELIA	Well, I'm just going to have to let Hilly know I'm not a boyfriend stealer. In fact, I'll tell her Friday night at the benefit. Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer.
F	MINNY	Now, Miss Celia...please don't be going to that benefit. Celia gets some ice out of the fridge. Did you hear what I said? Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She What are you doing?
F	CELIA	That looks bad.
F	MINNY	I got to get my work done.
F	CELIA	I know you didn't fall in the tub, Minny. Let me take a look. Celia grabs Minny's hand. Minny pulls away. Come here, Sexy! Johnny, you are bad! Bad! Bad! Minny looks at the ridiculous image of herself crouching on She raises Celia's ice rag up to her swollen eye.
F	SKEETER	What's wrong?
F	AIBILEEN	Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter. Gone be there four years. Minny shouts out across the kitchen.
F	MINNY	Hilly Holbrook been sent from the devil to ruirn all our lives.
F	HILLY	Please! A nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity. It took'em all of five minutes to figure out where she worked. Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	I knew that girl was a thief the day she started.
F	SKEETER	I'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer.
F	MINNY	She had a lawyer. A white lawyer! But Miss Hilly friends with the judge's wife. Whole thing took two days. Arrested on Tuesday, in the state pen by Wednesday.
F	AIBILEEN	The church gone send them boys to college. Gone pass the plate `til they graduate... The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm.
F	PEARLY	I'm on help with your stories. Another WOMAN walks over.
M	BLACK WOMAN	I'm on help too. Another woman speaks from the living room.
M	BLACK WOMAN 2	We all are. Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads. Skeeter
F	SKEETER	Thank you. I don't know what to- They doing this for Yule May.
F	PEARLY	Been there thirty-eight years and Miss Margaret still makes me put my hair up in a rag. Say she know coloreds don't wash theys hair. But, I love her. She love me too.
F	CORA	I had been workin' for Miss Jolene's mother up `til she died. Then her daughter, Miss Nancy, asked me to come work for her. Miss Nancy a real sweet lady. But her momma left it in the will that I had to work for her daughter, Miss Jolene. Miss Jolene a mean woman. Mean for sport. I tried to get another job, but in everbody mind, the French family and Miss Jolene owned me. CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes.
F	CALLIE	I used to take a shortcut ever day to work at Doctor Dixon's house. Cut through this farmer's lower forty to get there. One day, that farmer was waitin' on me with a gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I walk on his land again. Doctor Dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres. Told him he `bout to start farmin' too. But he bought it just for me. So I could get to work easy. He did. Skeeter closes her eyes for moment.
M	BEFORE HER.	Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26.
F	GRETCHEN	All these colored women have been real nice, haven't they?
F	SKEETER	Yes. Very nice.
F	GRETCHEN	Well, they hate you. You know this? Every little thing about you. But you're so dumb, you think you're doing them a favor. Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback.
F	SKEETER	You don't have to do this.
F	GRETCHEN	You know the nicest thing a white woman's ever done for me? Gave me the heel of her bread. These women are playing a trick on you. They'll never tell you the truth!
F	SKEETER	You don't know what they've said.
F	GRETCHEN	Say it, lady, say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you. Nigger. Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen.
F	AIBILEEN	That's enough, Gretchen.
F	GRETCHEN	You just as dumb as she is.
F	AIBILEEN	Get out a my house!
F	AIBILEEN	Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter.
F	SKEETER	Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me.
F	AIBILEEN	And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home. Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Charlotte shouts Skeeter's name from down the hall.
M	CHARLOTTE (O.C.)	Eugenia?! Skeeter's eyes pop open. She's groggy and hasn't fully
F	SKEETER	What?! Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter. Reality sinks in.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Oh my God! Oh my God! When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	Don't move a muscle! Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure Charlotte enters and heads straight for Skeeter's closet.
F	CHARLOTTE	Morning, Sleepy Head.
F	SKEETER	Morning, Mom. Charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed, right on
F	CHARLOTTE	I thought you could take me to the doctor this morning and then we could get some lunch afterwards.
F	SKEETER	Sure! Charlotte spies a LARGE TOE sticking out of the covers. It
F	CHARLOTTE	Or...we could...go straight to Fanny Mae's for a girl day.
F	SKEETER	Great! I'll get dressed.
F	CHARLOTTE	When did Stuart leave last night?
F	SKEETER	Right after you went to bed.
F	CHARLOTTE	Well, I hope he knows he's welcome to stay in Carlton's old room.
F	SKEETER	I'm not really ready for that yet.
F	CHARLOTTE	"Bird in the hand," Eugenia. Bird. In. The. Hand... Charlotte exits and shuts the door.
M	STUART	Chirp. Chirp. Skeeter is mortified. Stuart sits up, grinning.
F	SKEETER	Oh my God! Stuart tries to kiss Skeeter. She resists.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	My breath is horrible.
M	STUART	So is mine.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	I love you.
F	SKEETER	I love you, too. They kiss. We hear archival footage of Walter Cronkite addressing the Celia runs into the living room. Tears stream down her face. Cronkite tells the nation that John F. Kennedy is dead. A neighbor suddenly pulls up in his car stopping in front of
M	STUART	Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get down to the coast. Skeeter nods as Stuart kisses her.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	I'll be back in time for the benefit. Love you.
F	SKEETER	You, too. We hear Walter Cronkite's parting thoughts on JFK. Aibileen grows anxious. She suddenly jumps out of her chair
F	SKEETER	Are you okay?
F	AIBILEEN	The world done gone crazy, Miss Skeeter! And I'm scared! What if folks find out what we writing? Figure out Niceville really Jackson, and figure out who who?
F	SKEETER	Aibileen. We've changed all the names. Aibileen snaps.
F	AIBILEEN	Y'all two gone sit there and tell me you one hundred percent without a doubt sure `bout all this?! Skeeter looks away..
F	MINNY	No...So I been thinking...Maybe we need us some insurance. Skeeter look to Minny.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	I told God I'd never speak of it again. But we got no choice. It's time...Time to tell you both "the terrible awful" I did to Miss Hilly. It might be the only thing to protect us.
F	HILLY	Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthing, thieving nigra, did they? Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Pie's as good as always, Minny.
F	MINNY	I'm glad you like it. Hilly cuts another piece for herself.
F	HILLY	If...I take you back, I'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week. Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly.
F	MINNY	Take me back? Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice.
F	HILLY	What do you put in here that makes it taste so good?
F	MINNY	That good vanilla from Mexico... Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	And...something else real special.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	No, Missus Walters. That Miss Hilly's special pie.
F	HILLY	Momma can have a piece. Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Cut her one. MINNY Eat my shit. Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter.
F	HILLY	What did you say?
F	MINNY	I said eat my shit!
F	HILLY	Have you lost your mind?! Minny moves toward Hilly.
F	MINNY	No. But you're about to, `cause you just did. Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice.
F	HILLY	Did what? Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing
M	MISSUS WALTERS	Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I guess. And you didn't just eat one. You ate two slices! Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in.
F	AIBILEEN	You trying to get yourself killed?!
F	MINNY	No! I never planned to tell her! I just wanted to see her take a bite and leave so I could be done with her. Forever! She was never supposed to ask me back. Minny eyes narrow. And, then for less pay! That got me even madder. And, then she went slid that pie at me. Oh lord! That was it! I just lost control, Aibileen...you know how I get, now. So, before I knew it, it just came on out my mouth...and I had tolt her what was in that pie. Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head. Minny suddenly
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	I've asked God to forgive me. But, more for what happened to poor Missus Walters. Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing home just for laughing. We can't put that story in the book.
F	SKEETER	It's too dangerous, Minny.
F	MINNY	We need insurance! Hilly Holbrook can't never let people know that pie story is about her.
F	AIBILEEN	Exactly! If people find out "The Terrible Awful" was you and Miss Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble there ain't words for!
F	MINNY	Right! But don't you see? Miss Hilly gone go to her grave convincing people this book ain't about Jackson. Then we safe, insured! Minny gets up and walks toward Aibileen.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	You brought me into this, and I'm on finish it! Either put it in or pull my parts out all together. Minny storms out of Aibileen's kitchen.
F	MISS STEIN	The last editor's meeting is December 17th. If you want a chance of this getting read, I need it in my hands by then.
F	SKEETER	But that's in a week, Miss Stein! Otherwise it goes in The Pile. You don't want it in The Pile.
F	SKEETER	Yes, Ma'am.
F	MISS STEIN	And you must get a piece in about the domestic who raised you. It'll add something personal to it. Skeeter nods with frustration.
M	WLBT CAMERAMAN.	Dressed to the nines, Jolene raises a microphone and looks
F	JOLENE	This is Jolene French reporting from the African Children's Benefit Ball, and I'm here with League President Miss Hilly Holbrook.
F	HILLY	Thanks, Jolene... Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are Tables are covered with items donated for the auction. The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her
M	OLD HUSBAND	Look at the jugs on that one!
M	OLD WIFE	Bosoms are for bedrooms and breast- feeding. Not occasions of dignity. Celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into Johnny.
F	CELIA	Do you think I might have overdressed a little? It's supposed to be formal, but this looks like a funeral.
M	JOHNNY	You look gorgeous. Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia.
F	MINNY	Look what she got on. Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.
F	AIBILEEN	Lord have mercy. Ladies better hold onto they husbands tonight. Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly And that's the man that don't even know he's paying me. Skeeter enters with Stuart. She wears a long-sleeved black
F	AIBILEEN	There's Skeeter and that must be Stuart. He's handsome... Missus Walters?! Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded
F	MINNY	Hilly can throw her in a home, but she can't keep the taxis away.
F	CELIA	Well, hello, Elizabeth.
F	ELIZABETH	Hi. Elizabeth's homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet
F	CELIA	Those are lovely dresses.
F	JOLENE	Yours too.
F	CELIA	Really?! I was worried I was a tad overdressed. Jolene reaches out an pats Celia's shoulder.
F	JOLENE	Oh, no. You're just perfect. Elizabeth pulls Jolene away. Celia downs her drink.
F	HILLY	Everybody enjoying their dinner? The room claps enthusiastically. Let's give a nice round of applause for all the men and women that have helped make tonight possible. Hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	A cause I'm sure is dear to their hearts as well. Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies
F	CELIA	Woo-hoo! Johnny grabs Celia by the arm and pulls her back down. Celia
M	JOHNNY	Honey, maybe you've had enough to drink. Try to eat your dinner.
F	CELIA	And have my stomach poke out?!
F	HILLY	Why, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised to see you here. Everybody knows you can't stand parties like this. Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm.
M	JOHNNY	Celia wouldn't have missed this for anything.
F	HILLY	Where is that wife of yours? Out selling hotdogs? Johnny looks away.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We dated long enough where I can do that, can't I? Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge Stuart. Hilly. Hilly walks away as Jolene approaches the podium.
F	JOLENE	I've got the list of winners!
F	JOLENE	I hope you enjoy your new set of tires, Missus Atwell. Now, on to the baked goods. Jolene flips a page. Oh, yum! Yum! The highest bid in baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's chocolate pie. Congratulations, Hilly Holbrook! The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes
F	HILLY	What? I didn't bid on anything. Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone signed me up for that pie. Oh, no. Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred.
F	CELIA	Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't know you're a fan of Minny's pies. Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	I've wanted to talk to you all night. Minny told me why you won't be my friend. You think me and Johnny went behind your back.
F	HILLY	Let me go! Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands.
M	STUART	Oh, God.
F	CELIA	I'm so sorry. What are you trying to do to me? What are you and that nigra up to?
F	CELIA	I don't know what you-
F	HILLY	-You liar! Who did you tell?! Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but
F	CELIA	Hilly, I got pregnant after you and Johnny broke up! The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's
M	MISSUS WALTERS	Oh, shit.
F	HILLY	Shut up, Mother. Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm.
F	CELIA	Johnny never cheated on you...At least, not with me. Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water.
F	HILLY	Johnny would never-
F	CELIA	And I'm sorry I thought you'd be tickled to win that pie.
F	HILLY	You tell that nigra if she tells anybody, I will make her suffer. Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen. Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking
M	JOHNNY	Celia, what's wrong, Honey?
F	CELIA	Uh-oh. Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet.
M	JOHNNY	Oh, shit! Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby.
F	HILLY	Get that cleaned up before it starts to smell.
F	AIBILEEN	Yes, ma'am.
F	SUGAR	That big-boobed lady Momma works for was drunker than an Injun on payday. Upchucked in front a everbody! As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of
F	MINNY	Don't you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth. Clothes on your back! You hear me? Minny storms off. You do it all the time.
F	HILLY	Just come on home and stay with us tonight, Mother.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	No thanks, I got a pie to eat. Hilly spins around and sees the pie.
F	HILLY	You throw that pie away right now!
M	MISSUS WALTERS	I spent good money on this. Won it just for you...
F	HILLY	You?! You signed me up? Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.
M	MISSUS WALTERS	I may have trouble remembering my own name and what country I live in. But there's two things I can't seem to forget. That my own daughter threw me in a nursing home...And that she ate Minny's shit. Missus Walters winks at Hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi
F	MINNY	Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how dinner got on the table if you laid up in bed? Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.
F	CELIA	The way Hilly looked at me. Like I was trash on the road. Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.
M	CELIA (CONT'D)	She billed me for her dress. In lieu of payment, she's asked that I send two-hundred dollars to the African Children's Fund and then she banned me from all future League events.
F	MINNY	She don't count. Don't judge yourself by the way she see you.
F	CELIA	I'm not right for this kind of life, Minny. I don't need a dinner table for twelve people. I couldn't get two people over here if I begged. She called me a liar and accused me of getting her that pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if it wasn't for that! I can't do this anymore to Johnny. I'm going back to Sugar Ditch.
F	MINNY	You gone leave your husband cause you threw up at some party? Celia sobs.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.
F	MINNY	Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout "The Terrible Awful," that you were making fun a her. It's my fault she pounced on you. But if you leave Mister Johnny, then Miss Hilly done won the whole ball game. Then she done beat me, and she done beat you. Celia lies there. Minny's concerned she's said too much.
F	CELIA	Thank you. For telling me that.
M	STUART	Hey, Honey.
F	SKEETER	Stuart! How are you calling me? Aren't you on the rig?
M	STUART	What if I told you I have twenty- four hours in New Orleans? That I'm in the Presidential Suite of the Roosevelt Hotel...That we have dinner reservations in the Blue Room tonight and lunch tomorrow at Galatoires. Skeeter becomes troubled... Did you hear me? I spoke to your dad, and he's gonna have Jameso drive you down right now.
F	SKEETER	Oh, Stuart.
M	STUART	What?
F	SKEETER	I have to work.
M	STUART	Work in the car. Jesus, Skeeter, it's a cleaning column.
F	SKEETER	I have a deadline, Sweetie. You should have asked me about this.
M	STUART	I'm trying to be romantic...
F	SKEETER	I'm sorry, Honey. I can't come. Stuart shakes his head and hangs up the phone.
M	FAYE BELLE	I remember hiding with Miss Lilia in a steamer trunk while Yankee soldiers stomped through Master's house. We were both four. Eighty- five years later she died in my arms. We's were friends `til the end. Her grandson still pays my rent. Buys all my groceries too.
F	SKEETER	I have one more story to type, but other than that, we are done.
F	AIBILEEN	Law, look at all them pages. Two- hundred and sixty-six of `em.
F	MINNY	Now we just wait and see? Hopin' Missus Stein publish it? Skeeter nods. What story you got left to type?
F	SKEETER	Mine. Aibileen looks at Skeeter.
F	AIBILEEN	If your momma won't tell you, I reckon I will.
F	CHARLOTTE	Have you been crying? You know that ages your skin, Dear.
F	SKEETER	Mother, I need to talk to you about Constantine.
F	CHARLOTTE	Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago.
F	SKEETER	Well, I have to speak to her.
F	CHARLOTTE	Now, you look. I was good to Constantine. Oh, she talked back plenty of times, and I put up with it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give me a choice...
F	SKEETER	What...happened?
M	CHARLOTTE (V.O.)	I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon. Constantine was to do the floors that morning so they'd be dry in time. Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly.
M	CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Well, the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived. A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to
M	CHARLOTTE (V.O.)	Then, she burned the coffee. She had gotten so old, Skeeter. Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman.
M	CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and I had had it. The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.
M	WOMAN	Watch out! With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her
F	CHARLOTTE	Get a hold of yourself, Constantine! Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted, And that's when it happened. Constantine wets herself. Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down Constantine looks to Charlotte.
F	CHARLOTTE	I told her she couldn't work here anymore and to go on home.
F	SKEETER	How could you humiliate her like that?!
F	CHARLOTTE	I didn't mean to.
F	SKEETER	Why didn't you help her?
F	CHARLOTTE	I was upset. I didn't know what else to do.
F	SKEETER	So you just threw her away? That woman did you the biggest favor of your life. She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance. Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.
F	CHARLOTTE	I didn't throw her away, Skeeter. Your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back. But she had already moved to Chicago. Left everything behind.
F	SKEETER	`Cause she didn't have anything anymore. You broke her heart!
F	CHARLOTTE	Please don't do this to me, Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you have to remember, they're not like us. They are different. Charlotte gets defensive. And you idolized her too much! You always have!
F	SKEETER	I needed somebody to look up to. Skeeter turns to leave. I have to go find her. She needs me.
F	CHARLOTTE	We finally found the address of her daughter in Chicago...so we sent Carlton up there to go get Constantine. Skeeter turns back to her mother.
F	SKEETER	And?
F	CHARLOTTE	When he got there...she was dead, Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey. Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's
F	SKEETER	Why didn't y'all tell me all this?
F	CHARLOTTE	I knew you'd blame me...when it wasn't my fault. It just happened, and it was so unfortunate. I'm sorry, Eugenia.
F	SKEETER	When did she die? How long had she been in Chicago?
F	CHARLOTTE	Two weeks. Skeeter stands, never turning as she exits. Constantine's story finally made it in our book. But the reason she got fired did not. Miss Skeeter just couldn't put that kind a shame on her own mother. A clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	They printed a few thousand copies with the worst advance Miss Stein had ever seen. The stack is "The Help," in hardcover. It's wrapped in pale
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	We got four hundred dollars. Got another four hundred when it got printed. Divided thirteen ways that came to sixty-one fifty-three a person. Minny hugs Sugar and runs out the screen door with her check Minny got so excited she burnt up a skillet of chicken.
F	MINNY	Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a that bed and let me in. It's twelve noon. I did all the shopping just like you asked. The door slowly opens. Celia steps out onto the porch, Well, look at you, Miss Celia.
F	MINNY	What's all this?
F	CELIA	I cooked it all by myself. I wanted to do something special. I wanted to say "thank you."
F	MINNY	Greens got just the right amount a hock taste to `em. That's a good pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught you to cook like this? Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens.
M	MINNY (CONT'D)	Corn bread's happy now. Celia lays down her fork.
F	CELIA	Are you happy, Minny?
F	MINNY	Why you ask such a funny question?
F	CELIA	Are you?
F	MINNY	A course I's happy. You happy too. Big house, big yard, good husband.
F	CELIA	You know, if I were you, I'd give it right back to him. I'd hit him over the head with a skillet and tell him to go straight to hell... Minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses.
F	MINNY	Maybe I will. Celia jumps up.
F	CELIA	I almost forgot the dessert. Minny smiles softly as Celia disappears into the kitchen.
M	SHOW RUNNER	Five, four, three, two, one.
M	MALE HOST	Welcome back to "People Will Talk." And do we have something to talk about. Jolene has quite a book to review. Jolene shakes her head, visibly upset.
F	HILLY	Why are you frowning, Jolene? Hilly leans over and taps her television.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	You don't look cute that way.
M	MALE HOST	It's called "The Help." A new book by an anonymous author. Aibileen jerks her head toward the television.
M	MALE HOST (CONT'D)	Touching and enlightening, it's filled with testimonials from Mississippi's own housekeepers.
F	CELIA	Look how cute that dress is.
M	MALE HOST	Takes place in the fictional town of "Niceville." The book is dedicated to C and T. If you're out there C and T, we'd love to have you on the show because Niceville sounds like Jackson, if you ask me. The host starts laughing. Jolene snaps.
M	JOLENE FRENCH	It's not Jackson! It's a disgrace to the South! A disgrace to good Southern women who've spent their lives taking care of their help.
M	LEEFOLT HOME	Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing. She snaps to
M	MALE HOST	But did you read that ending?
M	JOLENE FRENCH	I know I personally treat my help like family, and every one of my friends does the same. Bertha, if you're listening, I have a new found respect for what you do. And, believe me, I'll be passin' on dessert at your table! Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty
M	JOLENE FRENCH	Do not buy this book! Ladies of Jackson, do not support slander with your husband's hard earned- Poof! Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream
F	HILLY	Don't cut her off like that.
F	ELIZABETH	What's that book called, Aibileen?
F	AIBILEEN	I...I wasn't paying attention. She races to the register like a teen buying a Playboy.
M	TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY	Back at the table of books, we see in rapid succession the
F	SKEETER	I knew nothing about it. Miss Stein's P.R. Department called the station directly.
F	AIBILEEN	Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book. They so scared.
F	MINNY	`One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss Hilly in less than a hour. She better read it quick and start the "this ain't Jackson crusade."
F	SKEETER	Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book.
F	MINNY	Oh, she gone read it. Especially after that man made such a stink on the tee-vee. She gone read it. They stop and nod with speculation. As she turns a page, her face reveals a dawning realization. She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling.
M	STUART	That month felt like a year. I missed you so much.
F	SKEETER	Me, too.
M	STUART	Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going back on the rig. Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires.
F	SKEETER	Stuart...I have to tell you something.
M	STUART	How about "yes?!" I had this with me down in New Orleans, you know. Skeeter touches Stuart's face.
F	SKEETER	I'm serious...and...you have to promise not to tell anyone.
M	STUART	Hang on. Did you say `yes'?
F	SKEETER	Yes. Stuart hugs Skeeter. She pulls back.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	But listen. Can I have your word? Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment.
M	STUART	Sure. You have my word.
M	STUART	This is what you've been writing for the last twelve months?! What happened to the cleaning column?
F	SKEETER	I did both.
M	STUART	So, the talk in town? I said they were dead wrong. Told them you were too smart to get mixed up in anything like that. Skeeter reaches to calm him. He pulls away.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	That joke you played on Hilly with the toilets. Hell, that's funny. But this? I don't understand why you did this...why you even care.
F	SKEETER	What?
M	STUART	Things are fine around here. Why stir up trouble?
F	SKEETER	I'm not stirring up trouble, Stuart. Trouble's already here.
M	STUART	I guess it is. Skeeter grabs his arm.
F	SKEETER	I had to tell you. You needed to know. Stuart shakes his head and pulls away...
M	STUART	I guess I don't really know you, Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody I don't know. Stuart looks down at the ring.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	That was my grandmother's. Skeeter hands the ring back. Stuart shoves it in his pocket.
M	STUART (CONT'D)	Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
F	SKEETER	Just leave.
F	CHARLOTTE	Skeeter?! Come in here, please. After a few moments, Skeeter enters.
F	SKEETER	You okay? Can I get you anything?
F	CHARLOTTE	Come here, Eugenia. I want to tell you something.
F	SKEETER	Me, too.
F	CHARLOTTE	You go first.
F	SKEETER	Stuart proposed.
F	CHARLOTTE	Finally!
F	SKEETER	You knew?
F	CHARLOTTE	Of course. He had to ask Daddy for your hand. She lifts Skeeter's ring hand. Seeing her bare finger,
F	SKEETER	Just say it.
F	CHARLOTTE	What did you do?!
F	SKEETER	Nothing! Skeeter stands to walk away.
F	CHARLOTTE	Young lady, I'm talking to you! Skeeter sits back down... Stuart'll come around. It's a funny dance. Took this one a year. Anyway, my news. After a long talk with your daddy, I've made a decision. My health's been on the uptick these past few weeks. And I know the doctor says it's some kind of last
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	But, as I said, I made a decision. I have decided not to die.
F	SKEETER	Oh, Momma. Charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away.
F	CHARLOTTE	Too late. I tried calling Fanny Mae's so I could make your hair appointments for the next twenty years, but they wouldn't allow it. Charlotte raises Skeeter's ring finger.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	I certainly can't leave you now. Skeeter laughs and hugs her mother. Robert never stirs. Hilly slows in front of the store's big glass entrance. She The voters of Hinds County had spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career. One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes
F	SUGAR	Momma, there's a white man at our door!
M	MAN (O.C.)	Minny Jackson! Are you in there?! Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and
M	MAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)	I can hear you. Open the door.
F	MINNY	Who there?
M	MAN	Johnny Foote. Minny Jackson, I want to talk to you. Open up. Minny slowly opens the door. Johnny is all smiles.
M	JOHNNY	Finally, I meet Minny Jackson... As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings. Johnny
M	JOHNNY (CONT'D)	What the hell are you doin'?! Minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor, raises her
F	MINNY	Please don't hurt me! My babies are in the house. Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor.
M	JOHNNY	Calm down, girl. I'm not here to get you.
M	JOHNNY	When I finally confronted Celia about you, she told me about the baby. All of them. You saved her life.
F	MINNY	I don't know about that.
M	JOHNNY	Well, I know the day you came to our house, she started getting better. And I'm not just talking about the cookin' either.
F	MINNY	You knew I was there?
M	JOHNNY	Fried chicken and okra on the first night? Y'all should have at least put corn pone on the table.
F	MINNY	I couldn't make you eat anymore corn pone, Mister Johnny.
M	JOHNNY	Next morning, I snuck back up to the house, peeked in the window, and there you were. Given ol' Oscar a wipe down. Minny smiles for the first time.
F	MINNY	So I ain't losing my job?
M	JOHNNY	You have a job with us for the rest of your life, if you want it. Aibileen nervously pours coffee.
M	JOLENE FRENCH	I heard that Betty character might be Charlene.
F	HILLY	It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage. I bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra. Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup.
M	LOU ANN TEMPLETON	And, Jolene, didn't your momma leave Cora to you in her will?
F	JOLENE	Well, yes...But that's not odd is it? Happens all the time, right? A sudden realization washes over Jolene.
M	LOU ANN TEMPLETON	Did anybody ever figured out who C and T are?
F	HILLY	The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON! Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	You spilled some, Aibileen. Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them.
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	Get me a new plate. One you haven't soiled with a dirty cloth. Minny takes note of all the cars.
F	MINNY	We late? Looks like Bible study done already started.
F	AIBILEEN	No. We ain't late.
F	AIBILEEN	Who we clappin' for? The woman laughs.
M	WOMAN	Honey, we clappin' for you. The woman raises a copy of "The Help." Aibileen notices a
M	REVEREND	Aibileen, this is an important time for you and our church. We know you couldn't put your name in here, so we all signed our own. The Reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper,
M	REVEREND (CONT'D)	This is for the white lady. Tell her we love her like family. Hundreds of signatures cover the pages.
F	AIBILEEN	Churches over two counties signed our books. All for you and me. Aibileen points to the inside back cover.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Doctor King signed it, too. He readin' our book. Aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of Dr. King.
F	MINNY	We did something. We did something good.
F	SKEETER	It's beautiful. Skeeter closes the book and sets it down regretfully. What's wrong? Skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse.
F	SKEETER	I got a job offer from Harper and Row...in New York.
F	AIBILEEN	Congratulations!
F	MINNY	That real good, Miss Skeeter.
F	SKEETER	I not taking it. I just wanted to share it with you both. There's no one else I can tell.
F	AIBILEEN	What you mean you not takin' it? This is what you been dreaming of.
F	SKEETER	I can't leave you two right when things are getting bad from a mess I created. I set out to write a book to make white people thankful. But in the end, what we should say is "sorry."
F	AIBILEEN	If bad things happen, they ain't nothing you can do about it. And if they happen, at least now theys a reason behind it. A reason we can wrap our heads around and be proud of... Skeeter nods with little relief.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	Now, I don't mean to rub salt in your wound, but...you ain't got a good life here in Jackson. Plus, your momma's getting better- Minny aggressively chimes in.
F	MINNY	You ain't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League. You done burned ever bridge there is. And you ain't never gone get another man in this town, and ever body know it. So don't walk your white butt to New York, RUN IT! Minny leans over, placing her hand on Skeeter's for the first And you listen to me. I'm on take care a Aibileen, and she gone take care a me. Skeeter nods.
F	AIBILEEN	Go find your life, Miss Skeeter. Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.
F	SKEETER	What are you doing here? Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.
F	HILLY	Don't you get an inch closer! Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain
M	HILLY (CONT'D)	I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie Goodman. He's the best libel attorney in Mississippi. You're in big trouble, Missy. And you're going to jail.
F	SKEETER	You can't prove anything, Hilly.
F	HILLY	I one-hundred-percent know you wrote it `cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you. Those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble.
F	SKEETER	Exactly who are you talking about? You don't know anything.
F	HILLY	I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh- huh. Remember her? Had you in her wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before putting in the L- shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's dining table. And that nigra, Minny? Do I have plans for her.
F	SKEETER	Careful, Hilly. Don't give yourself away now.
F	HILLY	That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE! Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.
F	SKEETER	I did not invite you here! Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.
F	HILLY	I've come to tell your mother what a hippie you've become. She's gonna be disgusted by you. Skeeter can't help but laugh.
F	SKEETER	You're telling my mother on me? Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.
M	SKEETER (CONT'D)	You get out of here! Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.
F	CHARLOTTE	Why, Hilly...It's been such a long time, Dear. Everything okay, you two? Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.
F	HILLY	Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-
F	CHARLOTTE	Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill? Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.
F	HILLY	Well, I...I didn't have time to get fixed up before-
F	CHARLOTTE	Darling, no husband wants to come home and see this. Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	And that...that is horrendous.
F	HILLY	Missus Phelan, I'm here-
F	CHARLOTTE	You know, Hilly. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too many...SWEETS? Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get one of those on our lip. Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother, Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays
M	CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D)	Eugenia?
F	SKEETER	Yes, Ma'am. Come in here, please. Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.
F	SKEETER	Ma'am?
F	CHARLOTTE	Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible study? Anything like that?
F	SKEETER	No, Ma'am.
F	CHARLOTTE	Good. We're going shopping. Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief.
M	CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)	`Cause no single daughter of mine is going to New York, representing the great state of Mississippi, without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.
F	SKEETER	What?
F	CHARLOTTE	I'm very proud of you, Eugenia.
F	SKEETER	How do you know about New York?
F	CHARLOTTE	A friend of Constantine's told me. Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help". Would you do me the honor of signing my copy? Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand
F	MINNY	They fired Leroy last night! And when Leroy ask why, his boss say Mister Holbrook told him to do it. Said his nigger wife the reason.
F	AIBILEEN	Oh, Law!
F	MINNY	He try to kill me with he bare hands! He threw the kids in the yard, lock me in the bathroom, and say he gone set the house on fire.
F	AIBILEEN	Where are you now?!
F	MINNY	The gas station. I climbed out the window, and we all ran here.
F	AIBILEEN	I'm on come there now.
F	MINNY	Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant.
F	AIBILEEN	Minny, now, you listen to me. That baby gone be fine, and you ain't never gone lose your job. Mister Johnny told you that hisself. They's more book money coming. Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat. You hear me? You free, Minny! You are free. Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	You hear me?
F	MINNY	I hear you... The Leefolt front door opens. Elizabeth calls out.
M	ELIZABETH (O.C.)	Aibileen?
F	AIBILEEN	Good morning. Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides
F	HILLY	Aibileen, the silver I lent Elizabeth last week.
F	AIBILEEN	It not polished good? Humidity been fighting me on polishing day.
F	HILLY	When you returned it, three pieces were missing out of the felt wrapper. A fork and two spoons.
F	AIBILEEN	Lemme...lemme go look in the kitchen, maybe I left some behind.
F	HILLY	You know as well as I do that silver's not in the kitchen. Aibileen turns to Elizabeth.
F	AIBILEEN	You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She been putting things-
F	HILLY	Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's trying to blame it on a toddler. Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen.
F	AIBILEEN	I ain't stole no silver. Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.
F	ELIZABETH	She says she doesn't have them.
F	HILLY	Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired, Aibileen. And I'll be calling the police. They know me. Mae Mobley enters the room.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Aibee, my froat hurts. Mae Mobley coughs.
F	AIBILEEN	I go get her some syrup, Miss Leefolt.
F	HILLY	Elizabeth can take care of her child. Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this
F	ELIZABETH	I'll go get the couch syrup. Hilly glares at Aibileen as Elizabeth runs down the hall.
F	HILLY	I won't tolerate liars! Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg.
F	AIBILEEN	I didn't steal no silver.
F	HILLY	I'm not talking about silver. I'm talking about those things you wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I can't send you to jail for what you wrote, but I can send you to jail for being a thief. And your friend, Minny? That nigra's got a nice surprise coming to her. Johnny Foote listens to what I say. She's as good as- Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.
F	AIBILEEN	Woman!...I know something about you. Don't you forget that. Hilly narrows her eyes.
M	AIBILEEN (CONT'D)	From what Yule May says, they's a lot a time to write letters from jail. Plenty a time to write ever person in Jackson the truth about you, and the paper is free.
F	HILLY	Nobody would believe something you wrote.
F	AIBILEEN	I don't know. Already sold a lot a books. Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.
F	HILLY	Get out of here!
M	MAE MOBLEY	Don't go, Aibiee! Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup.
F	AIBILEEN	Baby, you need to get back to bed. You got a fever.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Noooo! Don't go, Aibee. Please don't leave.
F	AIBILEEN	I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Why? Are you going to take care of another little girl?
F	AIBILEEN	No, Baby, that's not the reason. I don't want to leave you, but...It's time for me to retire. You my last little girl.
M	MAE MOBLEY	Noooo!
F	AIBILEEN	Baby Girl, I need you to remember ever thing I told you. Okay? Do you remember what I told you?
M	MAE MOBLEY	To wipe my bottom good?
F	AIBILEEN	No, Baby. The other. What you are.
M	MAE MOBLEY	You is kind. You is smart. You is important.
F	AIBILEEN	That's right, Baby Girl. Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both
F	HILLY	You need to go now, Aibileen! Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.
F	AIBILEEN	Give my sweet girl a chance. Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away. Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats
M	MAE MOBLEY	Aibeeeee! Don't go! Aibileen never turns. Mae Mobley was my last baby. In just thirty minutes, I felt like my whole life was done. Of the thirteen maids, seven of us got fired. Several other maids got fired who had nothin' to do with our book. Guess our stories weren't so unique after all...But, like Minny, we was all free.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	And we's was a lot freer than Hilly Holbrook. She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Ever so often, we all get a nice piece of book money in the mail. `Manna from heaven' we like to call it. Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is Born December 24th 1883 Died March 15th, 1963 A bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone. A
M	AIBILEEN (V.O.)	Thousands of our books went out all over the world. We had got paid to tell the truth and we just couldn't believe it... Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and "All My Babies" By Aibileen Clark Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of
