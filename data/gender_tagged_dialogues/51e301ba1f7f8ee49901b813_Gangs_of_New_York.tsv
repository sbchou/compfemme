M	EASTMAN	out with it then.
M	THE BUTCHER	damn craven, do it!
M	EASTMAN	the hell...
M	THE BUTCHER	eyes was open for that alright. And you still got one to see this.

M	TWEED	stand for anything if I tell you.
M	THE BUTCHER	think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes when
M	THE BUTCHER	never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you
M	TWEED	did you earn us, killing Monk?
M	THE BUTCHER	you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust in
M	TWEED	see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye.
M	THE BUTCHER	don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book,
M	TWEED	conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill. That's
M	THE BUTCHER	these manners?
M	TWEED	if you're hungry.
M	THE BUTCHER	always hungry.
M	TWEED	always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us
M	TWEED	me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the single course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be
M		could be a police matter.
M	TWEED	Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher
M		Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections. That Amsterdam boy has

M		the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point. There's
M	TWEED	would that be?
M		boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher. He's sworn revenge

M	TWEED	you, boys, thank you for your understanding. Mother.
M	TWEED	between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill
M		could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern
M	TWEED	so daunting as this. I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show

M	TWEED	weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days?
M	TWEED	swear that science will be the death of industry.

M		you'll allow me.
M		a scheme we might try.

M	TWEED	moment please, Daniel. One moment. a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam? therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here?
M		Science and opportunity.
M		got opportunities enough among your own.
M		did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow. And
M	TWEED	then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting... or perhaps
M		like that, yeah.
M	TWEED	fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind.
M	1	ain't goin' up there. I got my election suit on.
M		election'll be over unless we get up there.
M		This was your notion, you go up there.
M	2	He looks likely, and he ain't workin'.
M		Mike, you want to make ... much?
M	1	dollar.
M		dollars? Just to help us?
M	MIKE	the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany.
M	2	now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it ...
M		knows about it. Welre working a whole new scheme. But I won't tell him
M	MIKE	the ned?
M		was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him.
M		wasn't Tammany. Not like you.
M		made the right choice.
M		don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of your
M		didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam. And don't tell me what's my say my farewells.
M		still smell like drink.
M		Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected to third term! Tammany ticket for crime!

M	SPOILS	the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal.
M	SECOND	works the crowd?
M		This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing.

M		believed what people told them, that's all.
M		people is that? The Reverend at the mission? Boss Tweed? Daniel
M		believed Johnny.
M		
M		I believed you.
M		ain't done nothing different than what I told you, Jen.
M		believed what you said abaut being with me, with me alone. But you lied
M		don't care a fine damn about what they want! It's what I want! They
M		not a country for me, Amsterdam. I don't know about you. Will you
