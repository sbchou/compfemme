M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	EVEY (V.O.)	"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred years ago, in a cellar beneath the Houses of Parliament.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	He was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of London.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Sometimes I wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed. I wonder if it would have mattered.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I suppose the answer is in the rhyme. More than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	For in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget. This, then, is the story of that idea, of that spirit that began with an anarchist's plot four hundred years ago.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I was born near the end of the millennium, the year 1997. My father used to say that people were so afraid that the world was going to end that they were willing it to happen.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I don't remember much of the century's turn. I don't remember the market crash or the plague or any of the Trafalgar riots.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I've read about them since but I don't recall how any of them impacted my life except for the fear. They would hide it from me, like a secret between them.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	But I could feel it.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Of the chaos that seemed to swallow the beginning of the 21st century, there is one thing I do remember.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Very clearly, I can remember that sound.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	And I remember those boots, black leather that gleamed bright in the morning sun. I had never seen such boots. All moving in perfect unison.
M	DASCOMBE	The time has come, London, to return to a bygone age, an age of tradition, an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten. What this country needs is a leader! A true leader to remind us of that age. A righteous leader with the strength of his be done. I give you that man! I give you our leader! Adam Susan!
M	EVEY (V.O.)	It must have seemed so easy to them. They offered such a simple deal; give up control and we will restore order.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	At first, the arrests were political. Dissidents. Radicals. Liberals.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	When my parents were younger, they had been activists. They had marched with Labor in the great train strike.
M	LITTLE EVEY	Mommy?
M	MOTHER	My daughter! Don't take my daughter!
M	FATHER	Evey! Evey!
M	LITTLE EVEY	Mommy! Daddy!
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I never saw them again. Overnight, my life, my entire world was erased.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	It was done so quickly and violently, so completely, that it began to seem that it had never even existed.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	The homosexuals were next. What God had started with AIDS had to be finished by man. It was God's work. That's what we were told.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	But once they were gone, there was someone else. Someone different.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Someone dangerous. There were those who understood what was happening, who knew it was wrong but who kept silent.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	And in the vacuum of that silence, order was imposed.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Order that was like those boots, order that required rigorous discipline. Order that is exactly the same, where each single step falls with every step. The order of the many shaped into one.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Somehow in my heart, I knew it wouldn't last.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	What they thought they had crushed, the spirit they believed trampled and ground beneath the marching of their boots, rose up, rose as if from a four hundred year old grave, rose to remind us all that day. Good evening, London. It's nine o'clock, the fourth of November in the year 2019 and this is the voice of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285 of the medium wave.
M	FATE (V.O.)	People of London, be advised --
M	FATE (V.O.)	-- that Braxton and Streathon are quarantine zones as of today.
M	FATE (V.O.)	It is suggested that these area be avoided for reasons of health and safety.
M	FATE (V.O.)	Good news following the productivity reports from Herefordshire indicating a possible end to meat rationing starting mid February.
M	FATE (V.O.)	Police raided seventeen homes in the Birmingham area, uncovering what is believed to be a major terrorist ring.
M	FATE (V.O.)	Twenty eight people, eight of them women, are currently in detention awaiting trial.
M	FATE (V.O.)	And that is the face of London tonight.
M	FATE (V.O.)	And this is the voice of Fate signing off and bidding you a pleasant evening.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I don't know what brought us together that night. I had never been to that part of Westminster but ever since I've known him, I've stopped believing in coincidence.
F	EVEY	Excuse me? Uh... excuse me, Mister?
F	EVEY	Would you like... uh, would you like to sleep with me?
F	EVEY	I mean, for money.
M	MAN	That is the clumsiest bit of propositioning I've ever heard.
F	EVEY	Oh god, I'm sorry.
M	MAN	Is this your first time, darling?
F	EVEY	Yes, no, I mean for money. But I know what you want and I'll do it.
F	EVEY	Anything you want, mister. Please, I need the money. I know I'm young but I promise I know what I'm doing.
M	MAN	No. You don't know what you're doing.
F	EVEY	Christ, you're a Fingerman.
M	FINGERMAN 1	Give the little lady a prize.
M	FINGERMAN 2	I've got something to give her.
M	FINGERMAN 1	Prostitution is a class H offense. Know what that means? It means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion -- And you get to swallow it.
F	EVEY	Oh god, please. It's my first time. Please don't hurt me.
M	FINGERMAN 1	Gosh, fellas, look at those big innocent eyes. What do you think?
M	FINGERMAN 3	Spare the rod, spoil the child.
F	EVEY	Oh no!
F	EVEY	Please, don't!
M	FINGERMAN 3	You heard the man, sweetie. This rod's for your own good.
M	V	"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him."
M	V	"And fortune, on his damned quarrel, smiling, showed like a rebel's whore."
M	FINGERMAN 1	We're police officers, pal.
M	FINGERMAN 4	We're with the Finger.
M	FINGERMAN 3	So bugger off!
M	V	"Disdaining fortune with his brandished steel, which smoked with bloody execution."
M	FINGERMAN 1	He's got a knife!
M	FINGERMAN 3	Jesus Christ! Don't hurt me!
M	V	Good evening.
F	EVEY	Who -- Who are you?
M	V	Me? I imagine all manner of names shall be heaped upon my humble visage but, for now, let us simply say I am the villain.
M	V	And you would be?
F	EVEY	Evey.
M	V	Of course.
F	EVEY	Why did you do that? Why did you... help me?
M	V	Why indeed?
M	V	Almost time.
F	EVEY	For what?
M	V	For the music.
F	EVEY	Music?
M	V	Yes, music. My music. You see. Evey, I am a performer.
F	EVEY	Is that why you're wearing a mask?
M	V	We all wear masks. Life creates them and forces us to find the one that fits. Do you know what day it is?
F	EVEY	Uh... November fourth.
M	V	Not for long.
M	V	"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."
M	V	Tell me, Evey, what good is an actor that plays his part to an empty theatre?
F	EVEY	I don't know.
M	V	Nor do I. That's why you are here. I need you, Evey. I need someone to listen.
F	EVEY	To your music?
M	V	Yes. Yes, to my music.
M	V	Can you hear it? It's already begun.
F	EVEY	I can't hear anything.
M	V	At first, you have to listen very carefully...
M	V	Ahh, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?
F	EVEY	Oh my...
F	EVEY	It's beautiful...
M	V	Thank you.
M	LEADER	Gentlemen, I will hear your reports now. Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.
M	CONRAD	We have less than two minutes of usable footage, Leader. It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.
M	CONRAD	As you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary. As is his strength.
M	LEADER	Freeze it!
M	CONRAD	I'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible.
M	LEADER	Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!
M	ETHERIDGE	We were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks. We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions. All suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.
M	LEADER	Very good. Mr. Finch, speak for the Nose.
M	FINCH	Thanks to Etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks. These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace. Whoever he is, Leader, he's good.
M	LEADER	Thank you for that professional annotation.
M	LIEUTENANT (V.O.)	Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.
M	LEADER	Very good. Gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments. England prevails.
M	LEADER	Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind me?
M	ALMOND	Uh... the Fate computer system, sir?
M	LEADER	No. No sir. It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond. A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr. Almond?
M	LEADER	Control, Mr. Almond! Control! The world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right!
M	LEADER	Without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. Control, Mr. Almond. The control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years. Now, do you understand what happened last night?
M	ALMOND	We... lost control.
M	LEADER	Yes, Mr. Almond. Last night someone did the unthinkable. Someone hurt us. It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by god, I'll have yours.
F	EVEY	Wait. I've lost you.
M	V	No, you haven't.
F	EVEY	Oh...
F	EVEY	A jukebox? Where did you get it?
M	V	I saved it. Like everything here.
F	EVEY	Oh, it's beautiful. I've never heard anything like it.
M	V	Of course not. You grew up in their world. Art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think.
F	EVEY	This place is amazing.
M	V	You're welcome to stay.
F	EVEY	Stay here... with you?
M	V	Yes. If you like.
F	EVEY	I... I don't even know your name.
M	V	I don't have a name. But you can call me V.
F	EVEY	V? V... I like that.
M	PROTHERO	Good morning, London. This is the voice of Fate -- Damn.
M	PROTHERO	Good morning -- ack. Good morning Lond-- Goddammit! Where is my bloody tea?!
M	DASCOMBE	Would someone get his lordship his bloody tea?
M	DASCOMBE	Lewis, they want this report on the first hour --
M	PROTHERO	I know. I know. Damned inconvenient this entire affair. Fine. Let's try again.
M	PROTHERO	Good morning, London. It is 6 am, the fifth of November 2019 and this is the voice of Fate. The new day brings good news and bright prospects from overseas, where negotiations with New China are moving in a positive direction. Last night's scheduled demolition of two deteriorating landmarks went off without a hitch.
M	PROTHERO	Spokesman for the Interior ministry said both structures were severely damaged and judged to be a danger to the unsuspecting public. Plans for new landmarks are well underway.
M	PROTHERO	Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?
M	DASCOMBE	It's not our job to believe it, Lewis. Our job is to tell the people --
M	PROTHERO	"Exactly what they tell us." I Know but do you think that people will believe it?
M	DASCOMBE	They will if it's you that's telling it to them. Now let's try it again.
M	PROTHERO (V.O.)	... plans for new landmarks are already well underway.
M	PROTHERO	"Remember, remember, the fifth of November..."
M	PROTHERO	Do you suppose that's why he did it?
M	BODYGUARD 1	Sir, who did what, sir?
M	PROTHERO	Guy Fawkes. He tried to blow up Parliament.
M	PROTHERO	Don't they teach history in school anymore?
M	BODYGUARD 1	Sir, we're both straight military, sir.
M	BODYGUARD 2	Sir, yes, sir. I was fighting in Ireland by the time I was sixteen.
M	PROTHERO	Yes, of course. My mistake.
M	PROTHERO	I love trains. I remember riding the underground with my father. Shame they shut them all down.
M	BODYGUARD 1	What the hell's that!
M	BODYGUARD 1	I thought I saw a man jumping onto the train.
M	BODYGUARD 2	The train's doing almost seventy. It would break his legs.
M	BODYGUARD 1	You're right, I... It must have been rags.
M	PROTHERO	Get off of me!
M	BODYGUARD 2	What the fuck is going on?
M	BODYGUARD 1	Lock the car doors.
M	PROTHERO	I have a lighter... somewhere...
M	BODYGUARD 2	I can't find the lock -- wait. Hey wha--
M	BODYGUARD 1	What's happening --
M	PROTHERO	I found it!
M	PROTHERO	Oh god.
M	PROTHERO	Who are you? What do you want? Money? Is that it?
M	PROTHERO	Wait, wait. You're, you're the one that blew the Bailey.
M	PROTHERO	You're making a mistake. I'm nobody --
M	PROTHERO	Oh god, what do you want?
M	V	I've come to offer you a choice. Commander Prothero.
M	PROTHERO	What -- What did you call me?
M	V	Commander Prothero.
M	V	That was your title at Larkhill. You remember Larkhill, don't you, Commander?
M	V (V.O.)	Where they sent the undesirables.
M	PROTHERO	I don't know what you're talking about.
M	V	Maybe I can help your memory. Let's see. Larkhill opened in the summer of 2009. You were appointed it commander. You wore a uniform in those days. You looked very good in it. You were a man of many responsibilities. You made sure Larkhill made all its quotas, especially the oven quotas even though they required an excessive amount of maintenance. But there was one task you took to with exceptional relish. Remember the medical block, Commander? I believe you called it the funny farm. You were the one that selected the prisoners. You hand picked each one.
M	PROTHERO	Her.
M	PROTHERO	You.
M	PROTHERO	You! You're him, aren't you?
M	PROTHERO	Oh my god! What are you going to do?
M	V	You gave us a choice, remember, Commander? You said we could cooperate with the doctors or...
M	V	Hold out your hand.
M	PROTHERO	Oh no, no! Please I was just doing what I was told!
M	V	Of course you were. Now I'm telling you to make a choice. Either you stick that syringe into your neck or --
M	V	I can kill you right now.
M	V	Crying doesn't help, Commander. I remember there was a woman who had been screaming for two days. You winked at the doctor and laughed, "All in the name of science."
M	PROTHERO	Please, don't make me do this...
M	V	It's a difficult choice, isn't it? Certain death versus something that might be... worse. But you never know. There is still a chance. You could survive. Look at me. Now, time's up, Commander. Choose.
M	PROTHERO	I'll see you in hell.
M	V	Yes. I'm quite sure you will.
M	TRAIN MAN	This door's locked!
M	TRAIN MAN	Holy Christ!
M	TRAIN MAN	What happened here?
M	TRAIN MAN	Good lord! I need a medic here.
M	PROTHERO	Fi... Fi... Fi...
M	TRAIN MAN 2	He's trying to say something.
M	PROTHERO	Five.
M	TRAIN MAN 1	Five? Where's the goddamn medic?
M	PROTHERO	Room five.
M	TRAIN MAN 2	I think he needs a priest.
M	DOMINIC	What do you make of this, Mr. Finch?
M	FINCH	Hmm. It's a rose. A violet carson, I believe. Strange.
M	DOMINIC	Strange?
M	FINCH	I didn't think they still existed.
M	SOLDIER	Mr. Finch! Sir!
M	SOLDIER	Sir, they want you at headquarters, sir.
M	FINCH	Now?
M	SOLDIER	Yes, sir. I'm to transport you immediately.
M	FINCH	Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I'll be back as soon as I can.
M	LEADER	Ah, Mr. Finch. I sent for you because what I have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio. What I have to say cannot leave these four walls. Do I make myself clear?
M	FINCH	Yes, sir.
M	LEADER	I believe in a few things, Mr. Finch. I believe in god. I believe in the destiny of the Nordic race. And I believe in fascism. The romans invented fascism. They had a symbol for it; a bundle of twigs bound together. One twig could be broken but a bundle would prevail. That is the heart and soul of fascism. Strength in unity. I tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable.
M	FINCH	Well, I...
M	LEADER	You have in fact expressed your discomfort in several arrest reports, arrests that were, in your opinion, "unnecessary." The fact that you are here, that you are not rotting in a prison cell, is a mark of my respect and admiration for you, for your craft, and for what you have done for this country.
M	LEADER	It is also because I know you, Finch. I know what you are. You're a man like me. A man who understands when they are given a job what must be done. I understand you, Finch, and that is why I can trust you.
M	LEADER	This terrorist knows us, Finch. These attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. He knows what he's doing, Finch. He knows us all too well.
M	FINCH	You think he's an insider?
M	LEADER	What I think is that this man must be stopped. Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion. Do I make myself clear?
M	FINCH	Perfectly.
M	LEADER	England prevails, Mr. Finch.
M	FINCH	England prevails.
F	EVEY	V, v, v, v, v.
M	V	I hear your summons, my lady. And obey.
F	EVEY	Oh, V, you scared me.
F	EVEY	I was reading the inscription. What is it?
M	V	A Latin quotation. A motto. "Vi veri veniversum vivus vici." "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe."
F	EVEY	Yes, I suppose you have. This place is the only universe I have right now.
M	V	Does that bother you?
F	EVEY	I don't know. I'm so grateful to you -- I just feel I should help you, you know, the way you're helping me. I mean, that's the deal, isn't it?
M	V	No deals, Evey. Not unless you want them.
F	EVEY	I think I do. Part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what's going on outside. But that's not right. Is it? That's not taking responsibility. Not conquering my universe.
F	EVEY	I want to help you, V. I want to do something. Can we make a deal?
M	V	Yes. I think we can make a deal if you like. I think I know a way you could help me very soon indeed.
F	EVEY	Good. That's that, then.
F	EVEY	V, you said that Latin thing was a quote. Who said it?
M	V	Nobody you'd have heard of. A German gentleman named Dr. John Faust.
M	V	He made a deal too.
M	CONRAD	Hello, Rosemary. Derek, how --
M	HELEN	Derek!
M	HELEN	Darling, how are you? Hello, Rosemary.
M	ROSEMARY	Hello.
M	DEREK	It's so good to see you. Since this bloody terrorist business, the old man has me literally chained to the office.
M	HELEN	Oh, you poor dear.
M	DEREK	It comes with the job. How are things in the Eye, Conrad?
M	CONRAD	Well, we've been working some bugs out of the new Mark IX fiber optic network, actually --
M	HELEN	Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody bore. Do tell us about the terrorist, Derek. Is it true he blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
M	DEREK	I'm afraid so. We're dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case. We'll catch him though. I promise.
M	HELEN	Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. Aren't you glad you've got such a ruthless, implacable brute for a husband, Rosemary?
M	ROSEMARY	Yes, well --
M	HELEN	Believe me, you're lucky. You could be struck with a professional peeping tom like Conrad. England's highest paid voyeur, aren't you darling?
M	CONRAD	Helen, I think we'd better --
M	HELEN	Oh yes, of course. We have to get back so the little pervert can watch what the neighbors do after Sunday lunch. He's so exciting.
M	HELEN	Ciao!
M	DEREK	Goodbye, Helen. Conrad.
M	ROSEMARY	She's a bit hard on him, isn't she?
M	DEREK	Until you're half the woman of Helen's sophistication, I'd keep your little mouth shut.
M	DEREK	Really, just look at the way you dress.
M	LILLIMAN	Ah, there they go. My happy and contented flock. Spiritually refreshed and ready to face the world again.
M	LILLIMAN	Did you enjoy the sermon today, Dennis?
M	DENNIS	Very inspiring, your grace. Though the segue of the forces of Satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression.
M	LILLIMAN	Hmm, yes. A trifle purple, I thought. Still, Fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of the almighty, miserable sinners that we are?
M	LILLIMAN	And speaking of sin, I wonder which of the seven deadlies the good lord will see fit to tempt me with today.
M	DENNIS	Perhaps pride, your grace.
M	LILLIMAN	I was thinking of something a little less ethereal. Has the young lady arrived?
M	DENNIS	The agency informed me she'll be here directly. However, there was a mixup. It's not one of the usual girls. She's a little older.
M	LILLIMAN	Oh dear. Oh dear. Not too old, I trust?
M	DENNIS	They promise me she's no more than fifteen.
M	LILLIMAN	Fifteen, hmm.
M	LILLIMAN	Ah well, if Job could bear his disappointments, I suppose I must have the good grace to bear mine. Show her in when she arrives.
M	DENNIS	Yes, your grace.
M	DENNIS	The young lady, your grace.
M	LILLIMAN	Oh my!
M	LILLIMAN	And to think I doubted your loveliness for even an instant. Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa. You are a vision. An angel.
F	EVEY	Uh... thank you.
M	LILLIMAN	Of course, "hate the sin, love the sinner." I always say. Take your dress off, please.
F	EVEY	Listen -- I was kind of hoping --
F	EVEY	No --
M	LILLIMAN	You -- You filthy whore!
M	LILLIMAN	I'll kill you, you fucking sow.
M	LILLIMAN	What's this? Who --
M	V	Please allow me to introduce myself...
M	V	I'm a man of wealth and taste.
M	LILLIMAN	Dennis?
M	V	Shh. It isn't polite to disturb the dead on their journey.
M	V	A courtesy I'll most respectfully extend to his grace.
F	EVEY	V?
F	EVEY	V, what are you doing?
M	V	Vi veri veniversum vivus vici, Evey.
F	EVEY	Oh no.
F	EVEY	You can't kill him!
M	V	Death has followed his grace the whole of his career. Is it any coincidence it has finally followed him here?
F	EVEY	Oh god, V. I can't -- I can't --
M	V	Let us pray.
M	OPERATOR 1	Bloody hell. Doesn't anybody fuck with feeling anymore?
M	OPERATOR 2	Hey, it's Sunday. Children's hour over at the Abbey.
M	OPERATOR 1	Let's see what that filthy old pervert is up to.
M	OPERATOR 1	What the --
M	VOICE 1	... And I saw a black shape against the flames. Oh god. It's you. The man from room five. You've come --
M	VOICE 2	To collect what's mine.
M	VOICE 1	I beg you! I don't want to die! Please have mercy!
M	OPERATOR 1	Get me the Finger. This is an emergency!
M	DOMINIC	No prints yet, sir. Just like Prothero.
M	FINCH	I want those tapes from the Ear in my office tonight, Dominic.
M	DOMINIC	Yes, sir. They're on top of it.
M	FINCH	Any word from your superior, Mr. Creedy?
M	CREEDY	Mr. Almond doesn't seem to be answering his page, sir. I'm sure he's in the field.
M	FINCH	Quite.
M	HELEN	There you go, baby. Now my baby boy can think so much clearer. Can't he?
M	HELEN	You have been thinking, haven't you?
M	HELEN	I know you have. Ever since this terrorist appeared.
M	HELEN	Oh jesus, that smile. That smile turns me on like nothing else.
M	HELEN	Tell me. Tell me what's going on in that ruthless sadistic brain of yours.
M	DEREK	Everyone is so worried about the terrorist. Especially Susan. You know why? Because nobody knows what he's going to do.
M	DEREK	If I were him, I know what I'd do.
M	DEREK	I'd blow that fat bastard to kingdom come.
M	HELEN	No. You're kidding.
M	DEREK	Am I?
M	DEREK	There's an old train line under the New Government Building. It collapsed when they poured the foundation. You could haul in enough TNT to launch our Leader's ass all the way to the moon.
M	HELEN	You're serious, aren't you?
M	DEREK	You need to be careful, Helen. Your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day.
M	HELEN	Is that the same trouble you love putting in my mouth?
M	DEREK	You never know who might be listening.
M	HELEN	I know, Derek. You love your country and you love your party, just like you love your wife.
M	HELEN	Derek. I'm sorry. I know I can be a bitch. But that's why you're here, isn't it?
M	HELEN	This is it, isn't it, Derek? What we've been waiting for. At last, you'll be rid of Susan. I'll be rid of Conrad. And we'll be free. Free, won't we?
M	DOMINIC	Sorry it took so long. The boys had a devil of a time trying to filter out the background noise.
M	FINCH	Background noise?
M	DOMINIC	The perpetrator apparently turned on the Bishop's stereo. Subsequently, a great deal of the tape is useless.
M	FINCH	What music did he play?
M	DOMINIC	Beethoven. The fifth, I believe.
M	FINCH	Da, da, da, dum. That's code. Morse code.
M	DOMINIC	Sir?
M	FINCH	For the letter "V".
M	FINCH	Anything on the girl yet?
M	DOMINIC	No. The agency said somebody claiming to be Lilliman's valet canceled his Sunday appointment.
M	FINCH	What is it?
M	DOMINIC	23rd Psalm.
M	TAPE (V.O.)	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
M	DOMINIC	It goes on like that for a while. Fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part. Transubstantiation.
M	DOMINIC	That miracle business when the wafer transform into the body of Christ.
M	FINCH	He made him eat a host.
M	DOMINIC	Yes, listen to this part.
M	TAPE (V.O.)	... And at the moment this enters your mouth it becomes the flesh of the savior? Yes... please... And whatever it is made of now it will become the body of Christ? Yes... yes... I want you to swallow it.
M	DOMINIC	There's a couple of funny human noises...
M	FINCH	And then just Beethoven's fifth.
M	FINCH	We have got the initial path report back. The host was full of cyanide.
M	FINCH	And do you know what?
M	FINCH	When it reached his abdomen, it was still cyanide.
F	DELIA	Do you have a motive?
F	DELIA	I mean, was anything taken?
M	FINCH	Just lives.
M	FINCH	I know it's too early for your profile but do you have any initial impressions?
F	DELIA	Well...
F	DELIA	He's incredibly powerful. This man's sternum was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the manubrium.
F	DELIA	And he's resourceful. On that table behind you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in Prothero's blood stream.
M	FINCH	Bloody hell.
F	DELIA	There were hundreds of different chemicals in him. From trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil.
M	FINCH	Perhaps Fate will make something more of all this. I certainly can't.
F	DELIA	The Leader finally authorized an uplink for you? He must be getting nervous.
M	FINCH	Quite. Government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public. Oh, that reminds me.
M	FINCH	Can you tell us anything about this?
M	FINCH	We found one in the carriage with Prothero and this one in the Bishop's quarters. A violet carson.
M	FINCH	I heard that strain had died off. Thought a botanist might shed some light on it. Delia?
F	DELIA	Yes -- Yes, of course.
M	FINCH	Magic. I'll drop by tomorrow then.
M	V	"There is more behind and inside of V than any of us had suspected. Not who, but what: what is she?"
M	CREEDY	What's all this, then, Harper? I get a radio that a man's down and in need of assistance?
M	HARPER	I ain't gone down yet but I sure do need some assistance.
M	CREEDY	Are you flat broke already?
M	LOUT	How'd you sneak away, Creedy? Almond off buggering that blonde chippy?
M	HARPER	The one with the tits?
M	CREEDY	What I wouldn't give for a piece of that.
M	LOUT	She could serve a tray of drinks on those thingies.
M	HARPER	I bet you get your chance with her sooner than later, Creedy, with the way Almond's crackin' up.
M	LOUT	Bloody bugger's losing his marbles.
M	HARPER	Terrorist or no, if that bastard gives me another double shift, I'll stomp his fucking head.
M	CREEDY	Aye. This nonsense has put a serious strain on my drinking. I think I was actually sober today.
M	LOUT	I'll drink to that.
M	HARPER	We need to get a real man of the people in that director's position. Like Creedy here.
M	CREEDY	Well, it's good to know when the shit hits the fan who your real friends are.
M	ROSEMARY	Derek --
M	DEREK	I don't want to hear it, Rosemary.
M	ROSEMARY	Derek, please! We can't carry on like this.
M	ROSEMARY	You don't talk to me. You don't eat with me. You don't have sex --
M	DEREK	I don't have to take any crap from you! I have that fat bastard riding me all day. I don't want to listen to you, so shut your fat gob!
M	DEREK	And me not wanting to fuck you is obvious. Take a look at yourself.
M	DEREK	Get out of my sight. I'm cleaning my gun.
M	DOMINIC	I got it!
M	FINCH	A connection?
M	DOMINIC	Larkhill Resettlement Camp. Prothero's and Lilliman's employment records show they both help positions there at similar times.
M	FINCH	What about codename V?
M	DOMINIC	Most of Larkhill's records were destroyed for security reasons but I did uncover an old standard procedures and operations manual.
M	DOMINIC	In special case studies, medical research groups used roman numerals to identify test inmates.
M	FINCH	Five is the letter V. Brilliant, Dominic.
M	FINCH	All we need is Larkhill's employment records.
F	DELIA	Roses.
F	DELIA	It's you, isn't it? You've come to kill me.
M	V	Yes.
F	DELIA	Oh thank god. Thank god.
M	FINCH	Oh my god.
M	FINCH	Oh bloody hell.
M	DOMINIC	He's killed them all? It's not possible.
M	FINCH	Oh no.
M	V	Are you afraid?
F	DELIA	No, no. I thought I would be, but I'm not. I'm --
F	DELIA	Relieved.
F	DELIA	Oh god, all these years. All this waiting. And somehow I always knew you'd come back.
F	DELIA	When I saw you that night -- the night you escaped, you were standing against the flames and you looked straight at me.
F	DELIA	I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me.
F	DELIA	What -- what happened at Larkhill. What we did -- What I did. That terrible knowledge, it's been with me so long. That I could do things like that.
F	DELIA	For years, I blamed it on the government, on the authority I could never stand up to. But living so long with the knowledge of what I did has made me understand otherwise. I alone was accountable.
F	DELIA	There is something wrong with us. With all of mankind. With me. Something evil that made me enjoy what I did. Some hideous flaw.
F	DELIA	We deserve to be culled. We deserve it.
M	ROSEMARY	Derek? What?
M	DEREK	Bang.
M	DEREK	Don't worry, Rose. I didn't load it.
M	DEREK	Not tonight.
M	DEREK	Almond. What?! Where?
M	DEREK	Oh god, yes! God, thank you!
M	CREEDY	You look lost.
M	CREEDY	Can I buy you a drink?
F	EVEY	No... I made a mistake.
F	EVEY	I have to find someone.
M	CREEDY	Well I didn't like the looks of you anyway --
M	RADIO (V.O.)	All units, all units. Code red. Converge in Plaistow to apprehend codename V.
M	CREEDY	Bloody hell!
M	CREEDY	It's him! We got him!
F	DELIA	It's funny, I was given one of your roses today. I wasn't sure you were the terrorist until I saw it.
F	DELIA	What a strange coincidence. That I should be given it today.
M	V	There are no coincidences, Delia. Only the illusion of coincidence.
M	V	I have another rose. This one is for you.
F	DELIA	Then you are going to kill me now?
M	V	I killed you ten minutes ago. While you slept.
F	DELIA	Is there any pain?
M	V	No. No pain.
F	DELIA	Thank you.
F	DELIA	Can I -- Can I see your face again?
F	DELIA	It's beautiful...
M	DEREK	Don't move an inch, you bloody bastard.
M	DEREK	You didn't hear me arrive, did you? Didn't know we'd rumbled you?
M	DEREK	It's all finished, chummy. All of it. The old man told me it was my head or yours and what do you know. It's yours.
M	DEREK	Because you're standing over there with your bloody stupid knives and your fancy karate gimmicks --
M	DEREK	And I've got a gun.
M	DEREK	Bang.
M	DEREK	Who -- Who are you?
M	V	Yes, look. Look and tell me what you see.
M	DEREK	Horrible! God, it's horrible!
M	FINCH	Delia?
M	FINCH	Get an ambulance.
F	EVEY	Oh no... V?
M	DOMINIC	I'm sorry, sir. You knew the doctor pretty well?
M	DOMINIC	We found this on her bureau, sir. It's Dr. Surridge's journal. It covers her years at Larkhill. It might contain the whole story. May 23rd... Prothero has hand picked my subjects. Four dozen of them, none of which will be any use to me if I don't get to work soon.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	They're so weak and pathetic I find myself hating them.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	They don't fight or struggle. Just stare at you with weak eyes.
M	PROTHERO	Next. June 9th: Of the original four dozen, over 75% are now deceased. Strangely, no clear patterns have emerged as of yet.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	Batch 5 seems to have no common discernible effect on any specific group though the men seem slightly more resilient than the women.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	I'm hoping the survivors will provide more answers or my time here will have gone to waste. June 18: And only five left now. Two men and three women. Which tends to contradict my entry on the 9th.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	The man in room five is a fascinating case. Physically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with him. No cellular anomalies, nothing.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	Batch five, however, seems to have brought on some kind of psychotic breakdown. He's quite insane. He has this way of looking through you. Reverend Lilliman won't go near him. He claims that it is the devil in room five. I see him cross himself whenever he passes his door. Still, there's something about him...
M	DELIA (V.O.)	I'm glad Prothero let room five have a go at the gardening project. He is quite proficient. Prothero was reluctant to allow an inmate access to the tool and chemical supply at first but now the fat toad is delighted. The crop has almost doubled.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	He also grows roses. Beautiful roses. December 24th: I was in the mess. It was about half past ten when we heard the first explosion.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	The ones at the front ran straight into the gas. It was horrible.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	A few of us made it out through the rear door. You could hear men screaming everywhere. I hate the sound of men screaming.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	In the center of the camp, everything was on fire. Everyone running in all directions. We had hardly enough time to get our bearings when the ovens exploded.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	It was the man in room rive. I couldn't have known. The chemical supplies, grease solvents, ammonia, fertilizer. He'd been making things with them.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	Mustard gas...
F	DELIA	And napalm.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	And in the yard, I saw him. He had the flames behind him. He was naked. He looked at me...
M	DELIA (V.O.)	As if I were an insect. Oh god. As if I were something mounted on a slide.
M	DELIA (V.O.)	He looked at me.
M	FINCH	That's the last entry until six months later when Dr. Surridge is back in London. There is no mention of the man in room five again. End of story.
M	FINCH	Except that it wasn't the end of the story.
M	FINCH	Between 2009 and 2012, over forty men and women who were previously stationed at Larkhill met with what were believed to be accidental deaths. Eventually, only three remained.
M	FINCH	The three he'd been saving until last.
M	FINCH	Everyone who worked at Larkhill. Everyone who could have identified him. You see there are two possible motives here. Not one.
M	FINCH	The first is revenge. He escapes from Larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors. The whole exercise an elaborate, chilling vendetta.
M	FINCH	That's the explanation that I find most reassuring, funnily enough. Because that means he's finished. It's over now.
M	FINCH	The second motive is more sinister. Like I said, everyone who could have identified him is dead.
M	FINCH	What if he's just been clearing the ground?
M	FINCH	What if he's planning something else?
M	FINCH	You see, the diary we found was in full view. We didn't have to search for it. He left it there. He wanted us to find it. He wanted us to know the story. Or...
M	FINCH	For all we know, the diary could be a complete and utter fake. Codename V could have written it himself.
M	FINCH	He's playing games with us. He might never have been at Larkhill at all. Do you see? It could all be another smoke screen, a false trail, another cover story --
M	LEADER	Enough!
M	LEADER	Mr. Finch, would you please explain to me the nature of this meeting?! Because I was under the impression that you had some information about the terrorist, codename V!
M	LEADER	No more questions, understand! I want answers! I am not interested in where he grew up, what kind of flowers he likes or his favorite color!
M	LEADER	Do I make myself clear?
M	FINCH	Yes, Leader.
M	LEADER	Dismissed. England prevails, Mr. Finch.
M	LEADER	Mr. Finch, the girl. Do you have anything on the girl?
M	FINCH	No, Leader. Not yet.
M	MAN	Wake up, cow.
M	GUARD 1	Tsk. This pathetic whore is the famous Miss Hammond?
F	EVEY	You've made a mistake.
M	ROSSITER	Shut up.
F	EVEY	Please. I haven't done anything --
M	ROSSITER	I said shut your hole!
M	INTERROGATOR	Do you know why you're here. Evey Hammond?
F	EVEY	No, please, I didn't do anything.
M	INTERROGATOR	Allow me to be more precise. Did you participate in the murder of Dr. Delia Surridge?
F	EVEY	No.
M	INTERROGATOR	Did you participate in the murder of Derek Almond, director of the Finger?
F	EVEY	No, I --
M	INTERROGATOR	Did you participate in the murder of Bishop Anthony Lilliman?
F	EVEY	Oh god, I don't --
M	INTERROGATOR	Have you ever participated in a terrorist act against your country?
F	EVEY	No --
M	INTERROGATOR	What is the identity of codename V?
F	EVEY	I don't know.
M	INTERROGATOR	You are a lying cunt.
F	EVEY	They were going to rape me, kill me --
M	ROSSITER	Shut up.
M	INTERROGATOR	This board will not tolerate any more of your lies, Miss Hammond. We have over 120 minutes of audio and videotape and 75 pages of testimonials from eye witness that identify you as an accomplice to the terrorist, codename V.
M	INTERROGATOR	Do you want to know why you're here? You are formally being brought up on charges of murder on fourteen counts and sedition against your Leader and country which brings an automatic sentence of death.
F	EVEY	Please. I didn't do anything.
M	INTERROGATOR	Process the prisoner and return her to her cell until she is more cooperative.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I read her letter. Hid it. Slept. Woke. They questioned me. And I read her letter again. Over and over...
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Her name was Valerie.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I was born in a rainy burg in Nottingham in 1975. I passed my eleven plus and went to girl's grammar.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I met my first girlfriend at school. Her name was Sara. Her wrists. Her wrists were beautiful.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I sat in biology class staring at the pickled rabbit fetus while Mr. Herd said it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew. Sara did. I didn't. In 1994, I stopped pretending and took a girl called Christine home to meet my parents. A week later I moved to London to go to college and study drama. My mother said I broke her heart.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	But it was my integrity that was important. Is that so selfish? It sells for so little but it's all we have left in this place...
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	It is the very last inch of us...
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	But within that inch we are free.
M	INTERROGATOR	Enough.
M	INTERROGATOR	Now Miss Hammond, let us review the facts.
M	INTERROGATOR	You work for codename V. Codename V killed Delia Surridge and then Derek Almond with your help and that is why you were found outside her home.
M	INTERROGATOR	Isn't that what happened, Miss Hammond?
F	EVEY	No. No, that isn't true --
M	INTERROGATOR	Oh dear, Rossiter?
F	EVEY	No, wait!
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	London. I was happy in London.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I played Dandini in Cinderella. The world was strange and rustling with invisible crowds behind the hot lights and all that breathless glamour. Work improved. I got small film roles, then bigger ones.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	In 2006, I starred in "The Salt Flats." That's where I met Ruth. We fell in love.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	Every Valentine's Day she sent me roses and, oh god, we had so much. Those were the best three years of my life.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	In 2010, they came.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	And after that there were no more roses...
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	Not for anybody.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	After the takeover, they started rounding up the gays. They took Ruth while she was out looking for food.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	Why are they so frightened of us?
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	They burned her face with cigarettes and made her give them my name. She signed a statement saying I'd seduced her.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I didn't blame her. God, I loved her but I didn't blame her.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	But she did.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	She killed herself in her cell. She couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch. Oh, Ruth.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	They came for me. They shaved off my hair. They held my head down a toilet and told lesbian jokes. They brought me here and pumped me full of chemicals.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I can't feel my tongue. I can't speak.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	It is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place but for three years I had roses and apologized to nobody.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish...
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	Except one.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	An inch. It is small and fragile and it's the only thing in the world that's worth having.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	We must never lose it or sell it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.
M	VALERIE (V.O.)	I don't know who you are but I hope you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and things get better and that one day people have roses again. I don't know who you are but I love you. I love you. Valerie.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I had come to know every inch of those four walls in that dark hell and they knew every inch of me. Every inch...
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Except one.
M	INTERROGATOR	"My name is Evey Hammond. On the 5th of November 2019, I was abducted by the terrorist known as codename V and then taken against my will to an unknown location."
M	INTERROGATOR	"Once there, I was systematically brainwashed by means physical and psychological. I was frequently subjected to sexual abuse during this period."
M	INTERROGATOR	"Eventually I was terrorized into helping him commit the murders of Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge, and Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of Westminster."
M	INTERROGATOR	"I, the undersigned, swear that the above statement is genuine and that it was not signed by means of intimidation."
M	INTERROGATOR	We'd like you to sign that for us, Miss Hammond. Where we've put the little cross.
F	EVEY	No.
M	INTERROGATOR	As you wish.
M	INTERROGATOR	Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell, Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men.
M	INTERROGATOR	chemical sheds and shoot her.
M	ROSSITER	It's time, unless you want to change your mind.
M	ROSSITER	Sign that statement. You could be out inside three years. Perhaps they'd find you a job with the Finger.
F	EVEY	Thank you but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.
M	ROSSITER	Then there's nothing left to threaten you with, is there? You are free.
F	EVEY	What?
M	V	Welcome home, Evey.
F	EVEY	You...
F	EVEY	You did this... to me.
F	EVEY	You did this to me!
F	EVEY	You -- You hit me and -- and cut my hair. It was you. It was just you all this time.
F	EVEY	You tortured me. You tortured me --
F	EVEY	Oh god, why?
M	V	Because I love you, Evey. Because I wanted to set you free.
F	EVEY	Love?
F	EVEY	Set me free? Don't you realize?
F	EVEY	Don't you realize what you did to me? You nearly drove me mad!
F	EVEY	I hate you.
F	EVEY	I hate you! Set me free? You put me in a prison to set me free?!
M	V	You were already in a prison. You've been in a prison all your life.
F	EVEY	Shut up! I don't want to hear it. I wasn't in a prison. I was happy! I was happy here --
M	V	Happiness is the most insidious prison of all, Evey.
F	EVEY	That's warped! That's evil and it's wrong! What gives you the right to judge? Who are you to say what's not good enough?!
M	V	You were born in a prison, Evey. I didn't put you there. I just showed you the bars. You've been in a prison so long, you no longer believe there's an outside world.
F	EVEY	Shut up! You're mad! I don't want to hear it!
M	V	That's because you're afraid, Evey. You're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in on you. You're afraid because freedom is terrifying.
F	EVEY	I can't feel anything! There's nothing left to feel! Don't you understand?
M	V	Don't back away from it, Evey. Part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to.
M	V	Woman, this is the most important moment in your life. Don't run from it.
F	EVEY	I don't know what -- Oh god -- I can't breathe --
M	V	Good. You're almost there. Go closer. Feel the shape of it.
F	EVEY	What are you doing to me? I can't breathe --
M	V	You were in a cell. They offered you a choice between the death of your principles and the death of your body.
F	EVEY	I feel -- I feel like I'm going to burst.
M	V	You said you'd rather die. You faced the fear of your own death and you were calm. Try to feel now what you felt then.
F	EVEY	Oh god -- I felt --
F	EVEY	Like an angel --
F	EVEY	Oh god, V, I'm so scared. What's happening to me?
M	V	The door of the cage is open, Evey. All that you feel is the wind from outside. Don't be afraid.
M	V	Try to walk. The lift will take us to the roof.
F	EVEY	The roof? Outside?
F	EVEY	I -- I don't want to be blindfolded.
M	V	No, Evey. No more blindfolds.
M	V	Do you feel it?
F	EVEY	Everything's so -- different.
M	V	I know. Five years ago, I too stared beneath a night like this. Naked under a roaring sky.
M	V	The night is yours, Evey. Seize it. Encircle it within your arms.
M	V	Bury it in your heart up to the hilt.
M	V	Become transfixed and transfigured --
M	V	Forever.
M	DASCOMBE	Finch!
M	DASCOMBE	Do you know what this is all about?
M	FINCH	No, but I can guess.
M	DASCOMBE	What?
M	FINCH	"Remember, remember, the fifth of November."
M	DASCOMBE	Oh come on. He's long gone. He has to be. He did what he came to do and it's over.
M	DASCOMBE	Isn't it?
M	FINCH	Not for us.
M	LEADER (V.O.)	A year, gentlemen.
M	LEADER	I have given you almost a year and you have given me nothing. Nothing!
M	DASCOMBE	Now Adam, there is no one better than Finch and you know it.
M	LEADER	Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. It is that very fact that keeps me awake at night, wondering if perhaps there is a reason that Mr. Finch has failed.
M	FINCH	What are you saying?
M	LEADER	I'm saying that perhaps I don't know you as well as I thought I did.
M	FINCH	Are you asking for my resignation?
M	LEADER	No, I am asking for some goddamn results!
M	DASCOMBE	It's not Finch's fault, Adam.
M	CONRAD	We've all been looking. The man simply disappeared.
M	ETHERIDGE	Vanished.
M	DASCOMBE	He's gone, Adam. It's over.
M	LEADER	It's over, is it? He's gone. Vanished, you say?
M	LEADER	Transcripts recorded over the last thirty days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive context. This is only thirty days!
M	LEADER	Is this what you consider, "disappeared?"
M	DASCOMBE	For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid variety show.
M	LEADER	Mr. Creedy, I want the producers, writers, and actors of that "stupid variety show" arrested and charged with sedition.
M	CREEDY	Yes, sir.
M	DASCOMBE	You can't be serious --
M	LEADER	Push me, Roger, push me and you'll find out how serious I am.
M	LEADER	This, this V is still out there. I can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public. Something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake.
M	LEADER	That is why I am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of November you are still giving me nothing more than excuses, I will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions.
M	LEADER	Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you in private. The rest of you are dismissed. England prevails.
M	LEADER	Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the Finger, you are the most important member of my cabinet.
M	CREEDY	I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.
M	LEADER	Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a good man, a man who understood what strength in unity meant, a man who, above all, loved his country. I need to know if you are such a man.
M	LEADER	Do you love your country, Mr. Creedy?
M	CREEDY	Oh god, yes!
M	HELEN	"The most important member of my cabinet." Yes it is, isn't it, dear?
M	CREEDY	Oh, don't stop.
M	HELEN	I stop when you stop. What did he say next?
M	CREEDY	I can't --
M	HELEN	Come on, Peter, what are you afraid of? Almond used to tell me everything and you're twice the man he was.
M	CREEDY	He asked me... if I loved my country.
M	HELEN	Oh yes, I can tell you do love your country, almost as much as you love this...
M	CREEDY	Oh god...
M	HELEN	Go on.
M	CREEDY	Then he asked me to do something... oh, oh...
M	HELEN	What?
M	CREEDY	Helen, I can't. I can't tell you.
M	HELEN	He told you to frame someone as the terrorist.
M	CREEDY	My god?! How did you know that?
M	HELEN	I know Adam Susan. Now who was it?
M	CREEDY	No way. I can't tell you that.
M	HELEN	Yes you can, honey. You can and you will. You have to trust me, love. We're going to help each other.
M	CREEDY	Helen, please.
M	HELEN	Look at that face. You see? You're just bursting to tell me.
M	HELEN	Now who was it?
M	CREEDY	It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH!
F	EVEY	That was beautiful.
F	EVEY	I've wanted to do this for a long time.
F	EVEY	Thank you, V. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
M	V	You did it all yourself, Evey. I just provided the backdrop but the drama was all your own.
F	EVEY	It was a good backdrop. I believed it. I really did. It's still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn't real. That it was just you. Especially the letter.
F	EVEY	It is a beautiful letter, V. Every time I read it I could feel Valerie, almost like she was holding me. I believed in her most of all. I believed that she loved me and I loved her back.
F	EVEY	I feel a bit foolish telling you this. I know that you must have written it and thought you should have it back.
M	V	But I didn't write that letter, Evey.
F	EVEY	What?
M	V	Come with me.
F	EVEY	Valerie?
M	V	Yes. Valerie Page. She was the woman in room four.
F	EVEY	She's beautiful.
M	V	She wrote the letter just before she died. I delivered it to you as it was delivered to me. The words you wept over were the same words that transformed me.
F	EVEY	Roses. You grew them for her.
M	V	Yes.
F	EVEY	They're beautiful. Evey, do you know what day it is?
F	EVEY	Two days before the first day we met.
M	V	You remembered.
F	EVEY	You're planning something, aren't you, V?
M	V	You know me too well now.
F	EVEY	What are you going to do?
M	V	I'm going to fulfill an old promise.
M	V	I'll show you.
F	EVEY	I've never been here before.
M	V	Yes. It is the deepest part of my home. Once you know it, I should think you'll know everything.
F	EVEY	Oh, V, it's lovely. Where on earth did you find it?
M	V	In a way, I suppose it really found me.
F	EVEY	What's in these packages?
M	V	Gelignite.
M	V	Careful.
F	EVEY	What are you going to do with all of it?
M	V	I told you. I'm going to finish what was started four hundred years ago.
F	EVEY	Where does this train go?
M	V	This is the old Victoria line but it is blocked, blocked somewhere between Whitehall and St. James.
F	EVEY	Whitehall... V, that's the New Government Building.
F	EVEY	But the underground has been shut down for years. How are you going to make it run without any power?
M	V	I just thought I might ask them to turn it on for me.
M	LEADER	Yes, Mr. Creedy?
M	CREEDY	Everything's set, sir. No worries.
M	LEADER	When?
M	CREEDY	Tonight.
M	ANNOUNCER	Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a story of treachery and betrayal from the Book of Daniel.
M	DASCOMBE	All of London's waiting. Ready, two. And here we go --
M	ANNOUNCER	Tonight, England's greatest hero repels the forces of darkness in a brand new episode.
M	HEIDI	Oh, Storm. Save me! Save me!
M	STORM	You mongrel trash, if you harm her!
M	MONGREL TRASH	Look out, de white debil has a laser lugar!
M	GUARD	Hey, what the -- ?
M	HEIDI	Oh Storm, hold me. Hold me tight.
M	FINCH	I don't know how you stand that tripe.
M	DOMINIC	Es gooh.
M	DOMINIC	Finch? Finch, what's wrong?
M	DOMINIC	What the hell?
M	FINCH	Don't you see, Dominic?
M	FINCH	I'm V.
M	GUARD	Bloody hell!
M	GUARD	Freeze!
M	GUARD	Fuck all.
M	DOMINIC	Creedy? What the hell's going on?
M	CREEDY	I'm here to arrest Mr. Finch for acts of treason and terrorism.
M	DOMINIC	You can't be serious.
M	CREEDY	If I were you, boy, I'd shut my hole unless you want to start explaining why you didn't say nothing about Mr. Finch's secret identity.
M	FINCH	Why don't you just shoot me, Creedy? Wouldn't that make everything a lot simpler?
M	CREEDY	Yeah, I suppose it would.
M	DOMINIC	Holy Christ! Creedy, you stupid ape! If Finch is V then tell me who is that?
M	V	Good evening, London.
M	CREEDY	Bloody fuckin' hell.
M	V	I thought it was time we had a little talk.
M	FINCH	He has to be at Jordan tower. Come on!
M	CREEDY	Don't just stand there! Follow them!
M	V	Are you sitting comfortably? Good. Then I'll begin.
M	LEADER	Damn you! Damn you!
M	LEADER	Lieutenant, ready my transport. I want every armed man within a hundred miles at Jordan tower. Now!
M	V	Right now, I imagine there are hundreds of soldiers rushing here to kill me because someone does not want us to talk.
M	MOTHER	Hush. Turn it up.
M	V	They are afraid that I am going to say the things that are not supposed to be said. They are afraid that I am going to say the truth.
M	V	The truth is that there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? If you look about, you witness cruelty, injustice and despotism. But what do you do about it? What can you do?
M	V (V.O.)	You are but a single individual. How can you possible make any difference? Individuals have no power in this modern world. That is what you've been taught because that is what they need you to believe. But it is not true.
M	V	This is why they are afraid and the reason that I am here; to remind you that it is individuals who always hold the power. The real power. Individuals like me. And individuals like you.
M	V	I have come to offer you a deal. If you accept, I will give you a different world. A world without curfews, without soldiers and surveillance systems. A world that is not run by other men but that is run by you. I am offering you a second chance.
M	V	Four hundred years ago, a great citizen made a most significant contribution to our common culture. It was a contribution forged in secrecy and stealth although it is best remembered in noise and bright light.
M	V	To commemorate that glorious night at precisely the stroke of midnight, the edifice of their world will erupt with enough sound and fury to shake the earth. All I ask is that you join me at the gates to watch as the past is erased, the pathway cleared so that together we can start toward a new day.
M	LEADER	I want this man dead! I want him shot on sight!
M	CAPTAIN	Yes, sir.
M	V (V.O.)	But, you ask, who am I to make such promises? A fair question but hardly necessary as you know me already. To know me any more you need only look to a mirror.
M	V	Truth be told, this wasn't even my idea, was it? If you think back, you'll remember that night, whispering in your lover's arms. I became a part of your plan just as you have now become part of mine. Give me the line of the queen and I'll give you your secret dream. On the twelfth stroke of the fifth day of the eleventh month, I hope we shall all meet again.
M	V	Until then, I bid you goodnight.
M	LEADER	Who was it? Who was he?
M	LEADER	Roger Dascombe! Of course. Of course! It makes such perfect sense.
M	CAPTAIN	Sir, I think there has been a mistake.
M	LEADER	No! There is no mistake!
M	CAPTAIN	But sir, there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and Dascombe together --
M	LEADER	Who? Who are these people? They must be detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead!
M	FINCH	But I thought I was the terrorist.
M	LEADER	Finch, what are you doing here?
M	FINCH	Since I'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect. I'm guessing the charges have been dropped.
M	LEADER	Be careful, Finch.
M	FINCH	I am careful, sir. Always. That is why I suggest that a search of this building begin immediately.
M	LEADER	The terrorist is dead!
M	FINCH	With all due respect, I disagree and I believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us.
M	LEADER	Are you challenging my authority?
M	FINCH	No sir, I'm trying to run an investigation --
M	LEADER	I am trying to run a country! When I tell you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead! If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition. Do I make myself clear?
M	LEADER	Now, it is imperative for the people of London to know that they are safe, that the terrorist is dead and everything is under control.
M	SPEAKERS	The terrorist is dead. No further threat exists. Everything is under control.
M	LITTLE GIRL	Bollocks.
M	LITTLE GIRL	Bollocks!
M	LITTLE GIRL	He's not dead! It's all bollocks!
M	V	... if you give me the line of the queen, I'll give you your secret dream.
M	FINCH	Play it again.
M	DOMINIC	Come on, Finch. We've seen it fifty times. I mean, after what they done to you, I don't know why we're even trying to stop him.
M	FINCH	I don't know. For twenty seven years, I've been at this job. Twenty seven years, I've done what I've been told to do. Maybe that's all there is to it. I'm just a dumb old dog. A dumb old dog that only knows one trick.
M	DOMINIC	That ain't it, Finch. It's more than that. I know you. It's something personal with this one.
M	FINCH	Maybe. And maybe I'm not ready for a revolution.
M	DOMINIC	Well, we got less than thirty hours to stop it.
M	FINCH	We will.
M	DOMINIC	How?
M	FINCH	It's on the tape. I know it. I can feel it. He did this for a reason. He needs something.
M	DOMINIC	What?
M	FINCH	The line of the Queen?
M	DOMINIC	But what does that mean?
M	FINCH	Maybe it's a line from Shakespeare. Or a book. I don't know.
M	V	... This wasn't even my idea, was it?
M	FINCH	But right here. He's talking to someone. Someone specific. Someone who knows what he wants.
M	V	If you think back, you'll --
M	V	Remember that night, whispering in your lover's arms.
M	CONRAD	Helen? Helen, why did you want that tape?
M	HELEN	Shut up, Conrad. I'm thinking.
M	V	... now you've become a part of mine.
M	HELEN	How? How did you know that?
M	CONRAD	Know what, my love?
M	V	Give me the line of the Queen and I'll give you your secret dream.
M	HELEN	All right. You have a deal.
M	HELEN	Oh no! Not you. Conrad. Not yet. Here you can have a chocolate. Open up. Open!
M	HELEN	Good boy. As for the rest of the box, perhaps when you're Leader.
M	HELEN	Right now I need something else Conrad. I need you to use that pretty little brain for me. You know all about the old underground, don't you?
M	HELEN	I need to know everything, understand? Everything.
M	ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	Ready in five, Leader.
M	ASSISTANT DIRECTOR	In four, three...
M	LEADER	Good evening London. As Leader of this great country, I felt it imperative to speak with you and to assure you once and for all that the shadow that recently fell across our land has indeed passed.
M	WOMAN	Oh, for fuck's sake.
M	LEADER	What we have endured this long year was no accident, no mere coincidence. This was not a simple act of terror conducted by a singular madman. No, this was a test.
M	LEADER	It was not me, nor the Party, nor the government that was threatened this year. It was our beliefs. Our faith. I believe that God himself bore witness to our struggle and like Job I believe that we have been vindicated.
M	DRUNK	Remember fifth of November!
M	LEADER	How do I know this? Let me read to you where I found the answer, where I so often find the answer. In the Scripture. Revelations.
M	LEADER (V.O.)	"If any man have an ear, let him hear."
M	LEADER (V.O.)	"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the Saints."
M	LEADER (V.O.)	"And I beheld another beast coming out of the Earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon."
M	LEADER (V.O.)	"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of men."
M	LEADER (V.O.)	"And he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those miracles which he had the power to do --"
F	EVEY	Oh, V, turn it off, please.
M	V	Of course, my dear.
M	CREEDY (V.O.)	But how does he know? I don't know. All I know is he does... And I know what he wants.
F	EVEY	What is that, V?
M	V	That, Evey, is what I have been waiting for. Do you know what I want? I want you just like this... Bent over that black leather chair...
M	CREEDY	What about Conrad?
M	HELEN	I told you, I'll handle Conrad and V will take care of Susan. The mob will take care of the guard and then... You can use the Finger to take over.
M	CREEDY	Use the Finger? You mean like this?
M	HELEN	Oh... oh... that is vulgar...
M	CREEDY	But you like it?
M	HELEN	Yes, oh yes, oh you're a pig, Peter...
M	CREEDY	That I am, misses. But I'm the pig that's gonna be running this country.
M	HELEN	Yes and I'm... I'm going to be Eva... Oh Eva...
M	HELEN	"Don't cry for me Argen... oh Argen... Argen... tina!
M	FINCH	Eighteen hours.
M	FINCH	Dominic!
M	FINCH	Dominic, go home.
M	DOMINIC	But I've still got over three hundred lines from The Fairy Queen.
M	FINCH	Forget it. There's no more time. You go home and get some rest. You're going to need it tonight.
M	DOMINIC	He's got us, doesn't he, Finch?
M	FINCH	Yes, he does.
M	HELEN	Now listen to me, Conrad. This is the most important moment of our lives. Everything I've worked and hoped for comes to this. Susan is a very dangerous man, especially now, that's why I need you, Conrad. I need you to be stronger than him. I need you to be the better man. Understand?
M	HELEN	If you do this Conrad, and you do it right, I'm going to turn you from the little man I married into the man of my dreams.
M	CONRAD	Oh, Helen.
M	HELEN	Not on the lips.
M	FINCH	Give it up, old man. You're not even sure you want to stop him.
M	FINCH	Christ! That's it! It's got to be it!
M	LIEUTENANT (V.O.)	Sir, Mr. Heyer is here to see you. Says it's urgent. And he's here with his wife, sir.
M	LEADER	His wife? Sir, yes, sir -- Wait, you can't go --
M	HELEN	Leader, I'm terribly sorry but I absolutely must speak with you.
M	HELEN	I have something to tell you, something important but --
M	HELEN	I can tell you and only you. In private.
M	HELEN	It is a matter of national security.
M	LEADER	Now what's this all about, Mrs. Heyer?
M	HELEN	Please, forgive me. I've been so afraid, afraid to come here to talk to you. I thought he must know. I was terrified he knew but I had to come because I knew you were the only one that can protect me.
M	LEADER	Protect you from what?
M	LEADER	Come now, Mrs. Heyer.
M	HELEN	You won't let him hurt me, will you?
M	LEADER	Let who hurt you?
M	HELEN	The terrorist.
M	LEADER	The terrorist is dead.
M	HELEN	Oh, how I wanted to believe it, Leader, but I know it's not true.
M	LEADER	How?
M	HELEN	Because I know who the terrorist is.
M	LEADER	Who? Who is it, woman?
M	HELEN	It's Conrad, Leader. Conrad. My husband is the terrorist.
M	LEADER	What?!
M	LEADER	How do you know?
M	HELEN	I saw him, Leader. In the middle of the night. I heard something. I went to the landing and that's when I saw it.
M	HELEN	That mask. That hideous smiling mask.
M	LEADER	But how did you know it was Heyer?
M	HELEN	I know, Leader. I know the way a woman knows.
M	LEADER	But you have no proof?
M	HELEN	Proof?
M	LEADER	Yes, proof? This is an extremely delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer. It has been reported that the terrorist is dead. It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete, conclusive proof. Do you have any evidence at all?
M	LEADER	But if you're right, if Heyer is indeed the terrorist...
M	HELEN	Leader! Wait!
M	CONRAD	Is everything all right? Helen?
M	LEADER	Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done her duty to her country.
M	LEADER	Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer. You will be taken care of. I will launch an immediate investigation and I promise, you will be the first to know when an arrest will be made.
M	CONRAD	Investigation of what?
M	LEADER	Subversion, Mr. Heyer. Your wife was privy to the dialogue of subversives. That's all you need to know at this time. Lieutenant!
M	LEADER	The Heyers are leaving. I need to see Mr. Creedy at once.
M	HELEN	Thank you, sir.
M	HELEN	I want you to go straight to your office and wait for me to call. When I do, I want you to come immediately home. Understood?
M	CONRAD	Yes, Helen.
M	HELEN	Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you.
M	CONRAD	I did it, Helen. I did it, didn't I?
M	HELEN	Tonight, Conrad.
M	CONRAD	Tonight.
M	HELEN	I promise you will never forget tonight.
M	HELEN	Goodbye, Conrad.
M	GUARD	Mr. Heyer! Mr. Heyer!
M	CONRAD	Yes?
M	GUARD	Sir, this package arrived for you, sir.
M	CONRAD	Thank you.
M	TAPE (V.O.)	Do you know what I want? I want you just like this... bent over that black leather chair.
M	FINCH	Oh my god. Use the Finger?... You mean like this?... Oh... That's vulgar... But you like it?... Yes... oh yes.
M	FINCH	Is the Leader in?
M	LIEUTENANT	Yes, but he's meeting with the Captain of the Guard.
M	FINCH	Perfect.
M	LIEUTENANT	Mr. Finch, you can't go in --
M	LEADER	Mr. Finch?
M	FINCH	Leader, I need as many men the Captain can spare and I need them right now.
M	CAPTAIN	What for?
M	FINCH	To capture codename V.
M	FINCH	He's underground. The old subway. I know exactly what he's going to do. If we move quickly, we can be there, waiting for him.
M	FINCH	Leader, every second we delay...
M	LEADER	I'm coming with you.
M	GUARD	Sir --
M	LEADER	There will be no discussion --
M	GUARD	But if Mr. Finch is right --
M	LEADER	I am sick to death of this terrorist being everywhere and nowhere! I will judge whether Mr. Finch is right and I will judge it with my own eyes! Do I make myself clear, Captain?
M	CAPTAIN	Sir, yes, sir!
M	LEADER	Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?
M	FINCH	No... no sir.
M	LEADER	Good. Captain, mobilize your men.
M	CAPTAIN	Sir, yes, sir.
M	LEADER	We'll find this bloody bastard and we will finish him.
F	EVEY	V?
M	V	Yes.
F	EVEY	V, what's going to happen?
M	V	Change, Evey. That's all. Just change.
F	EVEY	Is it going to be violent?
M	V	Yes, I suppose it will.
F	EVEY	But why? Why must is be violent?
M	V	Because, Evey, that is the nature of change. She is a temperamental creature that appears in earnest rarely but, when she does, she will wear one of two faces. The first face is the destroyer. It is lamentable but all true change begins with death.
F	EVEY	What is the other face, V?
M	V	The other face? She is the true face of change. The face of the creator. She is the one that remakes the world. Evey?
F	EVEY	Yes, V?
M	V	May I ask you for a favor?
F	EVEY	Of course.
M	V	It is a small thing but it would mean a great deal to me.
F	EVEY	Tell me.
M	V	I've never danced before. I've thought about it many times, here in this room, listening to the music. But I've always been alone.
F	EVEY	It would be my pleasure.
M	V	Thank you, Evey. You are an excellent dancer.
F	EVEY	All it takes is a little practice.
M	V	Alas, I have run out of time.
F	EVEY	V? What are you going to do?
M	V	Don't you remember? I have a date tonight, Evey.
F	EVEY	You're coming back though, aren't you?
F	EVEY	V, I won't let you leave unless you promise me that you will come back.
M	V	Of course, I'll be back. You don't think you can be rid of me now, do you?
F	EVEY	Just promise.
M	V	I promise.
M	LEADER	Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man is going to become an example so that every man, woman, and child in this country will remember what happens to those who would ever think to stand against the state.
M	LEADER	Captain, I need a gas unit down here with enough nerve gas to fill every rat-hole in these tunnels.
M	FINCH	I don't think that will be necessary.
M	LEADER	There are over one hundred of the best trained soldiers in this country down here. Let him come.
M	LEADER	Captain, what's happening?
M	RADIO (V.O.)	No sign sir. Repeat, no sign of him.
M	CAPTAIN	They lost him.
M	FINCH	This... this is a mistake.
M	LEADER	Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr. Finch.
M	FINCH	Leader, we have to get out of here!
M	LEADER	This was your idea.
M	FINCH	It was a mistake. This is what he wants. He knows us, Leader. He knows us too well. We have to get out of here before it's too late --
M	V (V.O.)	Good evening citizens of London. This is the voice of Fate. Your fate...
M	LEADER	What trick is this? Tonight, the face of London is going to change and I am going to offer you the chance to change with her. Your Leader is finished. He will not leave these tunnels alive.
M	LEADER	This is an outrage! I order you not to listen to this! At midnight tonight, the Head will be destroyed and a new era will begin. You must now decide if you are going to be a part of that era. You can choose to stay here and die with your Leader or you can choose to be free. The decision is yours and yours alone.
M	LEADER	Captain, order all your men to fall back and secure this position!
M	V (V.O.)	Some of you have wives. Some of you have families. All of you have lives. Consider each of them as you ask yourself, are they a part of the past, or are they a part of the future?
M	CAPTAIN	Fall back. Fall back and secure the central platform.
M	LEADER	Any man that disobeys this order will be court marshaled!
M	LEADER	Captain! Captain, where are your men?
M	LEADER	Goddammit, I will not tolerate this insubordination! I want those deserters shot, Captain.
M	LEADER	Shot on sight!
M	CAPTAIN	You! You! Point position. We're getting out of here! Now!
M	LEADER	Traitors! You cowards!
M	LEADER	I know who you are! I'll see you hang! Every last one of you!
M	LEADER	Finch? Finch! Finch, goddammit, you can't leave me! Don't leave me!
M	V	You are going to die as you ruled --
M	V	Alone.
M	LEADER	Damn you! Damn you!
M	LEADER	Conrad? Is that you? You're working with Finch, aren't you? And Creedy! You're all in this together!
M	LEADER	Who are you?
M	V	You, most of all, should know, Leader. You created me. Without you, I would never be. More than life, Leader, you gave me purpose.
M	V	"He that killeth with the sword, shall be killed with the sword."
M	LEADER	Noooo!
M	FINCH	Don't move!
M	LEADER	Mr. Finch! Oh god, Mr. Finch!
M	FINCH	Drop the knife.
M	LEADER	Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch. I knew you wouldn't desert me. You're a good man, Finch. A damn good man.
M	FINCH	No, Mr. Susan. No, I'm not. I'm a man who does his job and does what he's told. For twenty seven years, that's all I've been.
M	LEADER	Careful, Mr. Finch. He's quick as the devil.
M	FINCH	I've read Delia's diary over and over all year. It sickens me but I am unable to judge her. I am as guilty as she.
M	LEADER	Mr. Finch, what are you doing? Shoot him. Kill the bastard, Finch.
M	FINCH	I have no excuse. I did what I was told to do.
M	LEADER	Finch, I order you to shoot him! Finch!
M	FINCH	My job was to find you and catch you. I've done my job. I've done it for the last time. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it all.
M	FINCH	Kill him yourself if you can.
M	FINCH	Thank you, V. And goodbye.
M	V	Goodbye, Mr. Finch.
M	LEADER	I warned you, Finch, the penalty for treason is death.
M	LEADER	Are you ready to die?
M	V	The real question is, are you?
M	LEADER	Do you really believe you can pick up that knife before I pull this trigger?
M	V	No. But I don't have to.
M	V	You see? You cannot kill me. There is no flesh and blood within this cloak to kill. There is only an idea.
M	V	And ideas are bulletproof.
M	HELEN	Creedy? Creedy, you dumb bastard, you left your car parked in front.
M	HELEN	What did I tell you? Creedy.
M	HELEN	Oh my god.
M	CONRAD	Helen...
M	HELEN	Conrad! What have you done?
M	CONRAD	I won, Helen. I did it. I won. I'm the better man.
M	CONRAD	We've been through a bad patch, Helen. But now, he's gone... There's nothing to come between us...
M	HELEN	Don't touch me! You stupid piece of shit! You've ruined it! I had it all planned perfectly and you've ruined it!
M	HELEN	I have to get out of here! I have to get away!
M	CONRAD	Helen --
M	HELEN	No! Let go! Now!
M	HELEN	Conrad, damn you! Let me go!
M	CONRAD	No, Helen, you're not leaving me... not this time... not ever.
M	HELEN	No, please! Oh god, no! Oh god, please help me!
M	CONRAD	No one can help us, Helen. God is dead.
F	EVEY	V?
F	EVEY	You came back.
F	EVEY	V! V!
F	EVEY	Oh god, what happened?
M	V	Evey...
F	EVEY	You need a doctor. It's too late for that...
F	EVEY	No, don't say that!
M	V	Evey, listen to me. I've not long and there are things that must be said.
M	V	I have done that which I came to do. Now, it is time for me to rest and with me the past will, at last, find peace.
M	V	But the world, the world is not saved... Do not think that, when the fires die and the smoke clears, there is no miracle... there is only a path... upon which they must learn to rule themselves.
F	EVEY	Yes, they need you, V.
M	V	Not me, Evey, not me. I told you I am the villain. The destroyer... But yes, they will need help...
M	V	I kept my promise to you, Evey... Now you must promise me.
F	EVEY	What?
M	V	Promise me... you will discover the face under this mask... but you will never look beneath it.
F	EVEY	I don't understand.
M	V	Promise me. Please...
F	EVEY	I promise.
M	V	Sweet Eve. Wherever I shall go, I shall always love you.
F	EVEY	V, you are not going anywhere!
M	V	Midnight... Midnight. Eve... Make them remember...
F	EVEY	You're not going to die, V!
M	V	Let me be there, Evey, when it begins... Please, let me hear the music, one last time... my music...
F	EVEY	I won't let you die!
M	V	I know you won't... I know...
F	EVEY	V! My love... Ave Atque vale...
M	SERGEANT	Return to your homes! There is nothing to see! The terrorist is dead!
M	RABBLE ROUSER 1	He ain't dead!
M	RABBLE ROUSER 2	He'll be here, just like he said!
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I remember... I remember staring at the mask, at that smile.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Part of me couldn't believe he was dead and maybe that was why. The smile was still the same. It made me want to tear it off so I could see the face, so I could see that he was dead.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	But I had promised. You will discover the face under this mask but you will never look beneath it.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I began to try to imagine his face. Of course, I had long pictured my father behind that smile but I knew in my heart that V was not my father.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	Yet every time I pictured another face, any face, something was lost, something important was somehow diminished. V was more than a face. V was V. And then, quite suddenly, quite naturally, I realized whose face must be beneath that mask. It was the only face that mattered.
F	EVEY	I won't let you die. I know you won't... I know.
F	EVEY	Goodbye, my love.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	"Ave Atque vale."
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I looked it up the next morning.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	"Hail and farewell." "Make them remember..."
F	EVEY	They will, my love. They will. "Remember, remember, the fifth of November!"
F	EVEY	I have come here tonight to keep a promise. A promise that is over four hundred years old. Tonight I am here to give you your freedom!
F	EVEY	Since mankind's dawn a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives, responsibility that we should have accepted ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By doing nothing, we gave it away.
F	EVEY	Tonight, our world will change. Our leaders will be gone and we must choose what comes next. A return to the chains of others or lives of our own. A world of the past or one of the future.
F	EVEY	Let us choose carefully, London, and when we do, let us mark well and remember, remember this fifth of November!
M	V (V.O.)	Let me be there, Evey, when it begins... Please let me hear the music... one last time... my music.
M	V (V.O.)	At first, you have to listen carefully. Ah, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?
F	EVEY	Yes, my love. Yes it is.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I know that there is only one way to repay him for what he did.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	And I know that that way is going to take a lot of hard work.
M	EVEY (V.O.)	I know this like I know the sun will rise tomorrow and beneath that new sun, our work will begin.
