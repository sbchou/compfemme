M	VERONA (CONT'D)	Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me... ... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it... 5A 5A ... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself... shit out, right? Right? Don't bother... the shit I gave you is some fucking high tech sci-fi Chinese synthetic shit that even I don't know exactly what the fuck it is.

M	VERONA (CONT'D)	Hey, it's been real. Probably should've thought twice before you whacked Don Kim. Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? I thought so. Have a nice death...

M	KAYLO (O.S.)	Hello?
M	CHEV	Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night? KAYLO is late 20's, slightly plump, hispanic, with gelled AYLO h, what's up Chev? I said, where were you last night? PUTTING ON LIPSTICK, FAKE TITS, THE WORKS, VOGUEING AT SOME I ... uhh ...
M	HEV	Yeah, yeah. You wanna know what I was doing?
M	KAYLO	What?
M	CHEV	GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT!
M	KAYLO	What?
M	HEV	What? What? You heard me. That son of a bitch Ricky Verona.
M	AYLO	Ricky Verona ...
M	CHEV	Who would've thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib... it's inconceivable... and yet, here we are.
M	KAYLO	Where are we? CONTINUED:
M	CHEV	I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen: you put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call me.
M	CHEV (CONT'D)	I'm going to get that little son of a bitch if it's the last thing I do... it may actually be the last thing I do, understand that? Copy me on that?

M	CHEV	Where's Verona!!
M	ORLANDO	It's cool it's cool it's cool!
M	CHEV	Talk!!
M	ORLANDO	I'm talking! What are we talking about?
M	CHEV	Don't fuck with me!!
M	ORLANDO	OK, nobody's fucking with you, just calm down ...
M	CHEV	DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER!
M	BIKER (O.S.)	O-land-o! What's up!
M	ORLANDO	There's a white man with a gun in here, I would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit! Now you see that? I'm trying to help you here.
M	CHEV	Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ...
M	ORLANDO	Why would I know where ... ?
M	CHEV	... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!!
M	ORLANDO	THE WHITE MAN IS COOL! THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!
M	S	ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping.
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Can we all just get along? Can we?
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make?
M	CHEV	Where's Verona.
M	ORLANDO	OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky Verona.
M	CHEV	You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ...
M	ORLANDO	Easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? How discussion can lead to clarity?
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Clearly you are operating under a false pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not "pull the Anselmo job together." In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars.
M	CHEV	That's not how I heard it.
M	ORLANDO	But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down. S tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying
M	CHEV	Alright. away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
M	ORLANDO	Thank you. That's what I'm talking about. That resembles civility.
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Shit dude, what's the matter with you?
M	CHEV	Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ...
M	ORLANDO	I understand that. You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us. Now what can I do to help you?
M	CHEV	Look, just give me some coke, OK? You got any coke?
M	ORLANDO	OK, now you're insulting me.
M	CHEV	Come on, man, I know you got coke.
M	ORLANDO	You think every brother is carrying, is that it?
M	CHEV	Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ...
M	ORLANDO	I can see that.
M	CHEV	No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ... May I just have some coke, please?
M	ORLANDO	So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me.
M	CHEV	That's right. Well?
M	CHEV	W hat?
M	ORLANDO	You got something for me, or what?
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Chevy ... come on, man...
M	CHEV	OK, that's good. That's good.
M	RLANDO	Oh that's good, right?
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	W hy you looking for Verona anyway?
M	CHEV	Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me...
M	ORLANDO	Ah, so this is about the Don Kim situation. What do you know about it?
M	ORLANDO	I know you pulled the trigger.
M	CHEV	Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY WOULDN'T I PULL THE TRIGGER?!
M	ORLANDO	O...kay...
M	ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Whoa, Chelios. You good, man?
M	CHEV	his shit's not working.
M	ORLANDO	Beg your pardon?
M	HEV	I think I know what I have to do.
M	ORLANDO	Well, a man's got to do what a man's got to do. Uhh... what exactly is it that you got to do?
M	HEV	Got to kick... some black... ass.
M	ORLANDO	What? O There he goes again.
M	CHEV	Alright ... who wants white meat? A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it, HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE JACKHAMMER. Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating
M	CHEV	Doc? IN A SPLIT SCREEN WE SEE IT'S VERONA. VERONA ey, what's up, Doc!
M	CHEV	You motherfucker!
M	VERONA	ude, aren't you dead yet? What the hell are you doing out there?
M	CHEV	I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me.
M	VERONA	eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd like to know that I'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you've been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you...
M	CHEV	Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history.
M	CHEV (CONT'D)	Great. more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up

M	DOC MILES	Alright, slow down. You say you've been poisoned. Can you describe the symptoms?
M	CHEV	It's like... it's like... like I'm slowing down... like I'm caught in a tar pit...

M	EVE (CONT'D)	Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you change the clock on the microwave?
M	CHEV	What?
F	EVE	I never changed it back.
M	CHEV	The microwave.
F	EVE	Yeah. I never changed it back. You know, daylight savings time. C HEV I bought you some flowers, but they got fucked up on the way over here.
F	EVE	That's sweet. Are you OK? You look like you're on drugs or something.
M	CHEV	You love me, right?
F	EVE	Yes.
M	CHEV	Then I need you to do something for me.
F	EVE	What is it? What's wrong?
M	CHEV	I need you to put some clothes on and come with me right now.
F	EVE	But ... I ...
M	CHEV	I'll change the clock on the microwave.
F	EVE	OK.
M	HEV	That shit's wearing off ...
M	EVE (O.S.)	Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
M	CHEV	Great, great ...
M	EVE (O.S.)	You're so stressed out, do you want some pot?
M	CHEV	Yes. No! ... thanks ...
F	EVE	What's the matter?
M	CHEV	Nothing ... burned my hand ...
M	VE	Oh my God, are you OK? Let me see... It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ...
F	EVE	Come on, let me see ...
M	CHEV	I SAID I'M OK, CAN WE JUST LEAVE??!!
F	EVE	That was just totally uncalled for.
M	CHEV	I'm sorry ... look, can we just ...
F	EVE	Fine. A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each
M	CHEV	Shit! CHEV comes up behind EVE, grabs her by the shoulders and
M	CHEV	I'm parked out back. CONTINUED:
F	EVE	Oh darn... the thing.
M	CHEV	The thing. What thing.
F	EVE	The waffle thing. I forgot to turn it off. The HOOD runs his fingers down the directory list to: CHEV is SLACK-JAWED. Inside the apartment, the PHONE BEGINS
M	VE (O.S.)	Alright, alright...! Flustered, EVE picks up the phone.
F	EVE	Hello? The door SLAMS OPEN. The HOOD whirls to see CHEV, grim as a
M	VE (O.S.)	Hello? Hello? Alright, very funny... EVE pops out.
M	VE	I hate that...
M	CHEV	You trying to burn down the building?
M	CHEV (CONT'D)	Whoa whoa whoa... he building opens out back into a small parking area. Trash sight of the HOOD.
M	HEV	Aww, damn it, I'm sorry baby...
F	EVE	Nice one.
M	VE (CONT'D)	I swear to God, Chev, I don't know what you're on these days but it is not working for you... A PARAKEET in a cage by the window disappears in a puff of
F	EVE	You know, I could use a little help here.
M	CHEV	Is this yours?
F	EVE	Where's your car? CONTINUED:
M	CHEV	My car. Actually... I took a cab. A POLICE MOTORCYCLE is tipped over on a lawn, coughing up MONTAGE: Chinatown is bustling with activity. Vendors haggle together in a swelling din of live things.
M	E	and jogger.
M	VE	You're embarrassing.
M	CHEV	You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ...
F	EVE	Hm. So why are we here? CHEV sits across from EVE in a tiny restaurant. An equally
M	CHEV	"This isn't going to be easy" ... as they say ... Alright, here it is. I told you I was a video game programmer. That was a lie. Actually...
M	CHEV (V.O.)	I kill people. I'm a professional hitman. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate.
M	CHEV (V.O.)	Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special.
M	HEV (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range... S ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON
M	DON KIM	Well? What are you waiting for? CONTINUED:
M	HEV	Congratulations.
M	DON KIM	Did I win something?
M	CHEV	Your life, jackass. A hundred grand wants you dead, so sooner or later it's going to happen. But I'm not doing it.
M	DON KIM	I see.
M	CHEV	nstead, you're going to do something for me. You're going to get out of town. Disappear. I don't care where you go, I don't care what you do, so long as you're invisible for 48 hours. That's all I ask.
M	DON KIM	48 hours.
M	CHEV	Or if you prefer, we can do it the other way, the way where I go to work and you go meet Buddah.
M	CHEV	See: I quit. I quit the business. For you.
F	EVE	For me?
M	CHEV	figure I call you that night. I tell you everything. You understand. We get on a plane together and leave all this shit behind. Never come back. Pretty crazy, huh?
M	VE	You are so weird. Are we going on a trip?
M	CHEV	Yeah, well... I may be going on a trip, but you're not coming with me...
F	EVE	I don't understand. EVE storms out of the restaurant, letting the door slam
M	CHEV	Eve... baby... please!
F	EVE	Mob hits, Chev? Chinese poison? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? If you're going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth.
M	CHEV	You think it sounds crazy? How do you think I feel - I've gotta live this shit...
M	VE	Oh my God, Chev... what's the matter with you? CONTINUED: He looks around like a drowning man. People everywhere, but
M	CHEV	... just need...
F	EVE	Chev, you're scaring me.
M	CHEV	Wait a minute. Do you trust me?
F	EVE	No.
M	CHEV	Make love to me.
F	EVE	What?
M	CHEV	Come on. I think it'll help.
F	EVE	Help what?
M	EVE (CONT'D)	Get off! Are you kidding me?
M	CHEV	Take your clothes off.
F	EVE	No!
M	CHEV	You always say you want to be more spontaneous. E VE You're insane. You're like some adrenaline junkie with no soul.
M	CHEV	Save me, Eve. Save my life.
F	EVE	Stop it!
M	EVE (CONT'D)	Oh my God, Chev!
M	EVE (CONT'D)	You filthy animal ...
M	EVE (CONT'D)	Take me right here in front of everyone.
M	E	That's it... do it ...
M	VE (CONT'D)	Come on, put it in me...
M	EVE (CONT'D)	What are you waiting for? Tell me you're joking. Now you can't get it up?
M	CHEV	I'll fucking get it up!
F	EVE	God damn it, Chev ...!
M	CHEV	Shut up!
M	CHEV (CONT'D)	I'M STILL ALIVE! I'M STILL ALIVE!!!

M	CHEV	Carlito ordered this?
M	HOOD #1	Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die.
M	CHEV	Just die.
M	HOOD #1	Yeah. Just ... die.
M	CHEV	Maybe you're right.
M	HOOD #1	I mean we all gotta die sometime, right?
M	CHEV	That's true ... we all gotta die ...

M	HOOD #1	Eh? What the...?
M	CHEV	OW! CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a CONTINUED:

F	EVE	You weren't lying.
M	CHEV	Welcome to my life.
F	EVE	No, I mean: that you were going to give it all up for me.
M	CHEV	Oh. Yeah.
F	EVE	And the other part?
M	CHEV	The poison? Yeah, that's true too.
F	EVE	Then... that means...
M	CHEV	Pretty much.
F	EVE	How can we stop it?
M	CHEV	Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down.
M	VE	So... when we were in Chinatown...?
M	CHEV	Yeah. Sorry. What are you doing?
F	EVE	his will get you going.
M	CHEV	WHAT?
F	EVE	Come on, let's finish what you started.
M	CHEV	Oh boy...

M	HEV	I owe you again, Doc.
M	DOC MILES	You're my best customer.
M	CHEV	What is this stuff?
M	DOC MILES	Synthetic ephedrine, diluted with saline.
M	CHEV	It feels sort of good.
M	DOC MILES	Oh, I also gave you a little meth. That's the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you're feeling.
M	CHEV	So I'm not... better?
M	DOC MILES	Fuck no. You're in such shit shape it's stunning. I've never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking. You should be in a fucking medical journal or something.
M	CHEV	So... what are you going to do?
M	DOC MILES	The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor... meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical... it's a temporary fix...
M	CHEV	Then what?
M	DOC MILES	Look, if we put you on life support we could maybe string you out for a few days, but at some point you'd almost certainly lapse into a coma... and then...
M	CHEV	Does she know?
F	EVE	I hate television.
M	DOC MILES	f you want, I can load you up with something, you'll go out in a beautiful dream.
M	CHEV	A dream.
M	DOC MILES	Can I do that for you, Chev?

M	VERONA (CONT'D)	It's him. Alright, shut up.
M	VERONA (CONT'D)	What's up, corpse.
M	CHEV	Hey douchebag, thought you might be interested in a little deal.
M	ERONA	A deal? You're mental, dude.
M	CHEV	I want the antidote.
M	VERONA	Oh, the antidote, huh?
M	CHEV	That's right.
M	VERONA	And what are you prepared to give me. Asshole.
M	CHEV	How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker?
M	VERONA	Hmmm.
M	CHEV	Thinking about it?
M	VERONA	Alright.
M	CHEV	You like that deal?
M	VERONA	Whatever.
M	CHEV	I'll be at Downtown Standard in twenty minutes. You know the spot?
M	VERONA	Of course.
M	CHEV	Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing to some whore for a hand job ...
M	VERONA	I'll be there.
M	VERONA (CONT'D)	What the hell are you looking at?
M	V	Verona. You're not going to believe the call I just got. MONTAGE TO MUSIC: more of L.A. at 3 f.p.s. - the traffic
M	CHEV (O.C.)	It's going to be alright, baby. From a distance, in a locked off TELEPHOTO frame, we see CHEV
M	EVE (O.C.)	But... you said... I know. But things have changed. There's an antidote. I can make a deal for it, but I've got to go alone.
M	VE (O.C.)	I'm scared.
M	CHEV (O.C.)	Of course. But you'll be safe now. And I'll be back.
F	EVE	Do you promise?
M	CHEV	I promise. CHEV bangs through the revolving glass doors to the hotel. CONTINUED: The shot continues as CHEV moves through the LOBBY and makes The bathroom is empty.

M	KAREN CHELIOS	Where did I go wrong?
M	CHEV	Did you say something?
M	KAREN CHELIOS	Like talking to the wall... C HEV Mom?
M	KAREN CHELIOS	I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.
M	KAREN CHELIOS (CONT'D)	You never call, you never write... I haven't seen you since you ran out at
M	CHEV	Right, with you popping Valium like Tic Tacs and balling some new asshole every two weeks... why wouldn't I stick around for entertainment like that?
M	KAREN CHELIOS	That's hurtful.
M	CHEV	Mom, I got no time for this...
M	ORLANDO	You got no time, period.
M	CHEV	Orlando?
M	RLANDO	ou a persistent motherfucker, Chev Chelios, I'll give you that.
M	CHEV	This is weird.
M	ORLANDO	But you know this has got to stop sometime. What do you think you are, Michael Myers? They pop you and you just keep gettin up?
M	CHEV	I'm the Terminator.
M	ALEX	You was that, maybe. But there's a new gun in town.
M	CHEV	Don't tell me you're talking about your bro, Def Lepard.
M	ALEX	He did you pretty good, didn't he?
M	CHEV	Yeah, not so much. I don't get it - why didn't you guys just cut me up alive when you had the chance?
M	ALEX	Verona said you was Chev Chelios - A.K.A. Death On Two Legs. He said you probably been a contract killer since grade school.
M	MIRROR CHEV	Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies. Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. Cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like... like a GIFT... a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably get off on it...
M	HEV	Did you rehearse this?
M	MIRROR CHEV	No, this was the best way for a guy like you: a slow, ticking clock... winding down... inevitable... non-negotiable... until...
M	CHEV	Who the hell are you, anyway?
M	MIRROR CHEV	Don't you know?
M	CHEV	I think I'm starting to figure it out.
M	MIRROR CHEV	Yeah, well, better late than never. You know you're going to die up there.
M	CHEV	Yeah, maybe.
M	CHEV (CONT'D)	But I'm taking you with me. C HEV glances at the lit floor number display, then back.

M	CARLITO	Let me see that.
M	CARLITO (CONT'D)	Clever ... what is this, an insulin pump?
M	CHEV	Basically.
M	VERONA	What the fuck is insulin?
M	CARLITO	Ephedrine, right?
M	CARLITO (CONT'D)	Very resourceful ...
M	HEV	Found a new master, you little bitch, is that it?
M	VERONA	I'm nobody's little bitch.
M	CHEV	We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me... and you take it.
M	CARLITO	That's enough.
M	CHEV	You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show what a good bitch you are.
M	VERONA	I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me? He'll pay what I tell him to pay...!
M	CARLITO	I said that's enough. It's been a long day. But in the end, you must agree, it all works out quite nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you... ... and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall. Please understand, Chev, it's truly nothing personal.
M	VERONA	Speak for yourself.
M	CHEV	Is that what I think it is?
M	CARLITO	The Chinese shit. Hold him down.
M	CHEV	Not so fast, motherfucker.
M	VERONA	Dude's gone dipsy doodle...
