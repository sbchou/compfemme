M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MAN	What a marvel... what a marvel... As its door opens and the man enters. Dora!
M	VOICE	Yes... The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood. The voice . Can you help me with the ice? The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters . I expected you hours ago.
M	MAN	You can't imagine what just happened. I was coming back on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart thank heavens it was the way back and I'd already sold the geese!
F	WIFE	How much?
M	MAN	Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story. I was struggling to direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is out this late.
F	WIFE	Yes, very remarkable.
M	MAN	But that's the least of it! He stops to help me; we talk of He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name. The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb
F	WIFE	God has cursed us.
M	MAN	What?
F	WIFE	Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years. Quiet. Wind whistles under the eaves.
M	MAN	Why do you say such a thing! I saw the man! I talked to him!
F	WIFE	You talked to a dybbuk. Traitle Groshkover died of typhus in Pesel Bunim's house. Pesel told me-she sat shiva for A rap at the door. Neither immediately responds. Finally, to her husband:
M	MAN	For some soup, to warm himself. The wind moans. He helped me, Dora!
M	THE DOOR	We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks in the foreground, who has arranged his face into a strained background the wife stares, hollow-eyed.
M	MAN	REB GROSHKOVER! You are welcome here! Reverse on REB GROSHKOVER: a short, merry-looking fellow with silk hat and spectacles. He gives a little squeal of delight.
M	REB GROSHKOVER	You are too kind, Velvel! Too kind! Yes, your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout! What a wife you have!
M	MAN	Yes! A ray of sun, a ray of sun! Sit!
F	WIFE	My husband said he offered you soup.
M	REB GROSHKOVER	Yes, but I couldn't possibly eat this late, or I'd have nightmares. No, no: no soup for me!
F	WIFE	I knew it.
M	REB GROSHKOVER	I see! You think I'm fat enough already!
F	WIFE	No. A dybbuk doesn't eat. REB GROSHKOVER stares at her, shocked. The wife returns the stare. The husband looks from wife to REB GROSHKOVER, apprehensive. REB GROSHKOVER bursts into pealing laughter.
M	REB GROSHKOVER	What a wife you have!
M	MAN	I assure you, REB GROSHKOVER, it's nothing personal; she heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel Bunim's house. This is why she think you are a dybbuk; I, of course, do not believe in such things. I am a rational man. Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And even if there were spirits, certainly... He thumps his chest. I am not one of them!
F	WIFE	Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left unattended for many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the room-it must have been then that the Evil One- She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One. -took you!
M	REB GROSHKOVER	"My corpse!" Honestly! What a wife you have!
F	WIFE	Oh yes? Look, husband... one check... Then he left the room. He came back, and shaved the other... You were already gone!
M	REB GROSHKOVER	I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this makes me a dybbuk? It's true, I was sick with typhus when I stayed with Peselle, but I recovered, as you can plainly see, and now I-hugh! REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which the ice pick. REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick. The wife stares. The husband stares. Suddenly, REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing: What a wife you have! The husband can manage only a shocked whisper:
M	MAN	Woman, what have you done? shakes his head.
M	REB GROSHKOVER	Why would she do such a thing? I ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is possessed?
F	WIFE	What do you say now about spirits? He is unharmed!
M	REB GROSHKOVER	On the contrary! I don't feel at all well. One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets?
M	MAN	Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be!
M	REB GROSHKOVER	Perhaps I will have some soup. I am feeling weak... Or perhaps I should go... He smiles weakly at Dora.. One knows when one isn't wanted. He walks unsteadily to the door, opens it with some effort, and moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night.
M	MAN	Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will discover the body. All is lost.
F	WIFE	Nonsense, Velvel... She walks to the door... Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against

M	CLASSROOM	We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder quickly waggling. Periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting LARRY Gopnik.
F	LARRY	You following this?... Okay?.. So... Heh-heh... This part is exciting... Students follow along, bored. LARRY continues to write. . So, okay. So. So if that's that, then we can do this, right? Is that right? Isn't that right? And that's Schrodinger's paradox, right? Is the cat dead or is the cat
M	BLEGEN HALL	LARRY is entering the physics department office. The department's castored chair away from her typing.
F	SECRETARY	Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the three phone messages.
F	LARRY	Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in. A Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked
M	LARRY'S OFFICE	He is flipping through the messages. Absently:
F	LARRY	So, uh, what can I do for you? The messages: WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club REGARDING: "Please call." WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman REGARDING "Let's talk." WHILE YOU WERE OUT CLIVE Park REGARDING: "Unjust test results." He crumples the last one.
M	CLIVE	Uh, Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results of Physics Mid-Term were unjust.
F	LARRY	Uh-huh, how so?
M	CLIVE	I received an unsatisfactory grade. In fact: F, the failing
F	LARRY	Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That's accurate.
M	CLIVE	Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to be examined on the mathematics.
F	LARRY	Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really, can you.
M	CLIVE	If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel You understand the dead cat? CLIVE nods gravely. But... you... you can't really understand the physics without understanding the math. The math tells how it really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really works. CLIVE shakes his head, dubious.
M	CLIVE	Very difficult... very difficult...
F	LARRY	Well, I... I'm sorry, but I... what do you propose?
M	CLIVE	Passing grade.
F	LARRY	No no, I-
M	CLIVE	Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now I know it
F	LARRY	Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they. If likes. CLIVE impassively considers this.
M	CLIVE	Secret test. LARRY wraps a hand wearily over his eyes.
F	LARRY	. No, I'm afraid-
M	CLIVE	Hush-hush.
F	LARRY	No, that's just not workable. I'm afraid we'll just have to
M	CLIVE	Very troubling. He rises. . very troubling... He goes to the door, shaking his head, as LARRY looks on in surprise. LARRY stares at the open door. The secretary outside, her back LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head. his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop. A ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through Phone Voice Sy Ableman.
F	LARRY	Hello, Sy, LARRY Gopnik. LARRY. How are you, my friend. LARRY picks idly at the envelope.
F	LARRY	Good, how've you been, Sy? Inside the envelope: a thick sheaf of one-hundred-dollar bills.
M	SY	Oh fine. Shall we talk LARRY. LARRY reacts to the money.
F	LARRY	What?! Oh! Sorry! I, uh-call back! He slams down the phone.
M	. CLIVE!	He rushes out the door, through the secretarial area, and into toward the elevators. Empty. He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds. and, as she goes back to her typing:
F	SECRETARY	Sy Ableman just called. Said he got disconnected.
M	BATHROOM DOOR	A hand enters to knock. Man's Voice Out in a minute! SARAH, the sixteen-year-old girl who has just knocked, rolls
F	SARAH	I gotta wash my hair! I'm going out tonight!
M	VOICE	Out in a minute!
F	SARAH	Jesus Christ! She stomps down the hall.
M	KITCHEN	Judith, a woman of early middle age, is at the stove. SARAH enters.
F	SARAH	W is Uncle Arthur always in the bathroom?
F	JUDITH	He has to drain his sebacious cyst. You know that. Will you set the table?
F	SARAH	Why can't he do it in the basement? Or go out in the garage!
M	BUS	We are raking the exterior of an orange school bus as it rattles on the side identify it-to some, anyway.
M	INSIDE	We are locked down on DANNY as the bus rattles like an old crate, gears, belching exhaust. DANNY and the children around him vibrate from their lack of reaction, seem used to it. They raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson
M	DANNY	I had twenty bucks in it too. Inside the case. Mark Sallerson Twenty bucks! How come.
M	DANNY	I bought a lid from Mike Fagle. Couple weeks ago. I still owed him twenty.
M	Mark Sallerson	He already gave you the pot?
M	DANNY	Yeah but a couple weeks ago my funding got cut off. Fagle said he'd pound the crap out of me if I didn't pay up.
M	Howard Altar	What funding got cut off? Where do you get your money? Another boy, with thick glasses, is Ronnie Nudell.
M	Ronnie Nudell	What happened?
M	Mark Sallerson	Rabbi Turchik took his radio. Had money in it. Ronnie Nudell That fucker!
M	DANNY	Yeah. I think he said he was confiscating it.
M	Ronnie Nudell	He's a fucker! Where do you get your money? Mark Sallerson Mike Fagle's gonna kick his ass. Last week he pounded the crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer. Ronnie Nudell He's a fucker!
M	Mark Sallerson	Fagle? Or Seth Seddlemeyer?
M	Ronnie Nudell	They're both f ickers!
M	BATHROOM DOOR	A hand enters to knock. Uncle Arthur's Voice Out in a minute!
F	SARAH	Are you still in there?! Uncle Arthur I, uh.. . Just a minute!
F	SARAH	I've gotta wash my hair! I'm going out tonight, to the hole!
M	Uncle Arthur	Okay!
M	OUTSIDE	LARRY pulls into the driveway and gets out of the car. The purr looks. His point-of-view: Gar Brandt, the next-door neighbor, is mowing buzz cut and is wearing a white T-shirt. Another noise competes with the lawn mower: rattling, squeaking, orange school bus with Hebrew lettering pulls up across the street. pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger.
M	DINNER TABLE	LARRY sits in. His wife and two children are already seated. LARRY projects:
F	LARRY	Arthur! A muffled voice:
M	ARTHUR	Yeah!
F	LARRY	Dinner!
M	ARTHUR	Okay! Out in a minute!
F	LARRY	We should wait.
F	SARAH	Are you kidding! They start eating.
F	LARRY	Mr. Brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn.
M	JUDY	Does that matter?
F	LARRY	What?
M	JUDY	Is it important? LARRY shrugs.
F	LARRY	It's just odd.
M	JUDY	Any news on your tenure?
F	LARRY	I think they'll give me tenure.
M	JUDY	You think. Well, I don't know. These things aren't, you know.. .
M	JUDY	No, I don't know. Which is why I ask.
F	SARAH	Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with us?
M	JUDY	Ask your father.
M	BACK YARD	Twilight. LARRY is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum laying out an are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt, back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the
M	MITCH	Ow. LARRY walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing. Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt goes back to throwing.
M	MITCH	Ow.

M	JUDY	Honey. Honey.
M	JUDY	Did you talk to Sy? Still absent, without looking up:
F	LARRY	Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That's right, he called, but I-
M	JUDY	You didn't talk to him.
F	LARRY	No, I-
M	JUDY	You know the problems you and I have been having. Sympathetic, but still absent:
F	LARRY	Mm.
M	JUDY	Well, Sy and I have become very close. This brings LARRY's head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She In.short: I think it's time to start talking about a divorce. At length, trying to digest:
F	LARRY	. Sy Ableman!
M	JUDY	This is not about Sy.
F	LARRY	You mentioned Sy!
M	JUDY	Don't twist my words. We-
F	LARRY	A divorce-what have I done! I haven't done anything- What have I done!
M	JUDY	LARRY, don't be a child. You haven't "done" anything. I haven't "done" anything.
F	LARRY	Yes! Yes! We haven't done anything! And I-I'm probably about to get tenure!
M	JUDY	Nevertheless, there have been problems. As you know.
M	JUDY	And things have changed. And then-Sy Ableman. Sy has come into my life. And now-
F	LARRY	Come into your-what does that mean?! You, you, you, you barely know him!
M	JUDY	We've known the Ablemans for fifteen years.
F	LARRY	Yes, but you you said we hadn't done anything! JUDY suddenly is stony:
M	JUDY	I haven't done anything. This is not some flashy fling. This is not about woopsy-doopsy. LARRY stares at her.
F	LARRY	Sy Ableman! From down the hall, a knock on a door. A muffled voice:
M	ARTHUR	Out in a minute!
M	JUDY	Look, I didn't know any other way of breaking it to you. Except to tell you. And treat you like an adult. Is that so LARRY does not seem to be listening. His eyes roam the room as
F	LARRY	Where do I sleep? JUDY narrows her eyes.
M	JUDY	What?
F	LARRY	Arthur's on the couch!
M	JUDY	Look. Sy feels that we should-
F	LARRY	Esther is barely cold!
M	JUDY	Esther died three years ago. And it was a loveless marriage. Sy wants a Gett. This derails the conversation. LARRY stares, trying to pick up
F	LARRY	. A what?
M	JUDY	A ritual divorce. He says it's very important. Without a Gett I'm an Aguna.
F	LARRY	A what? What are you talking about? She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved:
M	JUDY	You always act so surprised. As she leaves: I have begged you to see the Rabbi.
M	FADE IN	LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a light sweeps across him and he looks up. A short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the LARRY stares at him.
M	BLEGEN HALL	LARRY enters the departmental office. His eyes are red-rimmed beard stubble. The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from
F	SECRETARY	Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the two phone messages.
M	HIS OFFICE	LARRY looks at the messages: WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club REGARDING: "2Â°d attempt. Please call." WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman
M	CALLED.	REGARDING "Let's have a good talk." A knock brings his look up.
F	LARRY	Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE. CLIVE Park enters the office. . Have a seat. LARRY uses a key to open the top left desk drawer. He takes out We had, I think, a good talk, the other day, but you left something that-
M	CLIVE	I didn't leave it.
F	LARRY	Well--you don't even know what I was going to say.
M	CLIVE	I didn't leave anything. I'm not missing anything. I know where everything is. LARRY looks at him, trying to formulate a thought.
F	LARRY	Well... then, CLIVE, where did this come from? He waves the envelope. . This is here, isn't it? CLIVE looks at it gravely.
M	CLIVE	Yes, sir. That is there.
F	LARRY	This is not nothing, this is something.
M	CLIVE	Yes sir. That is something. A beat. . What is it.
F	LARRY	You know what it is! You know what it is! I believe. And you know I can't keep it, CLIVE.
M	CLIVE	Of course, sir.
F	LARRY	I'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my consequences.
M	CLIVE	Yes. Often.
F	LARRY	Always! Actions always have consequences! He pounds the desk for emphasis. In this office, actions have consequences!
M	CLIVE	Yes sir.
F	LARRY	Not just physics. Morally.
M	CLIVE	Yes.
F	LARRY	And we both know about your actions.
M	CLIVE	No sir. I know about my actions.
F	LARRY	I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant me to understand.
M	CLIVE	Meer sir my sir. LARRY cocks his head.
F	LARRY	. Meer sir my sir?
M	CLIVE	Mere... surmise. Sir. He gravely shakes his head. . Very uncertain.
M	CLOSE ON A TONE ARM	A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record. Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew Close on the sleeve: Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion

He lifts the tone arm and chants He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant.

M	DANNY	Studying torah! Asshole!
F	SARAH	You little brat! I'm telling Dad!
M	DANNY	Oh yeah? You gonna tell him you've been sneaking it out of his wallet?
F	SARAH	All right, you know what I'm gonna do? You little brat? If you don't give it back? We hear the thunk of the front door opening. DANNY stands, calling:
M	DANNY	Dad?
M	FOYER	LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he stows it in the foyer continues, off:
M	DANNY	Dad, you gotta fix the aerial. Judith emerges from the kitchen.
F	JUDITH	Hello LARRY, have you thought about a lawyer?
F	LARRY	Honey, please! DANNY emerges from the hall. We're not getting channel four at all.
F	LARRY	Can we discuss it later?
M	DANNY	I can't get F Troop.
F	JUDITH	LARRY, the children know. Do you think this is some secret?
F	SARAH	Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again! And I=m going to the hole at eight! She hits DANNY on the back of the head.
M	DANNY	Stop it!
F	LARRY	SARAH! What's going on!
M	DANNY	She keeps doing that!
M	LATER	LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back, the hi-fi. On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound. There pencil busily scratching paper. We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the source of the sucking sound. After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY speaks into
F	LARRY	Arthur? Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling.
M	Uncle Arthur	Yes. LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.
F	LARRY	What're you doing? Still without looking up: Uncle Arthur Working on the Mentaculus. Long beat. Music. Scribbling.
F	LARRY	Any luck, um, looking for an apartment? More scribbling.
M	Uncle Arthur	No. The doorbell chimes.
M	FRONT DOOR	LARRY enters, glances through the front door's head-height window, hand arrested on the way to the doorknob. His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by the A middle-aged man, a few years older than LARRY. A fleshy face features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes.
F	LARRY	Sy. Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His voice vibrates with a warm,
M	SY	Good to see you, LARRY. He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his him. In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine. I'll get Judith.
M	SY	No, actually LARRY, I'm here to see you, if I might. He shakes his head. . Such a thing. Such a thing.
F	LARRY	Shall we go in the... He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings, conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between invading LARRY's space.
M	SY	You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this situation-it's so impawtant.
F	LARRY	Uh-huh.
M	SY	Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the news to you. She said you were very adult.
F	LARRY	Did she.
M	SY	Absolutely. The respect she has for you.
F	LARRY	Yes?
M	SY	Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The children. . The most impawtant.
F	LARRY	Well, I guess...
M	SY	Of coss. And Judith says they're handling it so well. A tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an incredible bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine,
F	LARRY	You know, Sy-
M	SY	Open it-let it breathe. Ten minutes. Letting it breathe, so
F	LARRY	Thanks, Sy, but I'm not-
M	SY	I insist! No reason for discumfit. I'll be uncumftable if you don't take it. These are signs and tokens, LARRY.
F	LARRY	I'm just-I'm not ungrateful, I'm, I just don't know a lot about wine and, given our respective, you know- He is startled when Sy abruptly hugs him. S' okay. He finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back.
M	SKEWED ANGLE ON PARKING LOT	We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open frosted school parking lot. The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out afternoon. A reverse shows DANNY in a stall, standing on a closed toilet, the bathroom window opened at the top. The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell leans against a long draw from a joint. DANNY emerges from the stall. Ronnie Nudell offers the joint. Want some of this fucker?

At length, some movement in DANNY's back, his head dips, and the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to

We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof. He climbs onto the roof. He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively, balance. He looks around. His point-of-view towards the front. An unfamiliarly high perspective the neighboring houses, almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically, waves the trees.

M	MITCH	Ow. Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and clouded by static, a an unfamiliar modality. Cantorial music. LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly away into the sybillant shushing of trees. LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial. The same crystal and now, layering in, the theme from F Troop.

M	ARTHUR	Will you read this? Tell me what you think? LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.
F	LARRY	Okay. Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook, focuses on LARRY.
M	ARTHUR	Boy. You should've worn a hat. The lights are out. Very quiet. Uncle Arthur lightly snores. squeaks. He shifts again. Another creak.
M	KITCHEN	LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator. softly on in the other room. From outside, a dull thunk. LARRY pulls back a curtain. Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice and sloshing. The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with closed the front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut father down the walk to the car in the driveway. pre-dawn quiet:
M	GAR	Let's see some hustle, Mitch.
M	CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK	Its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading: The Mentaculus Compiled by Arthur Gopnik After a beat LARRY's hand enters to turn the page. The second covered with equations. This brings LARRY's look up from the Mentaculus. We are in LARRY's the office doorway is Arlen Finkle.
F	LARRY	Hi Arlen.
M	Arlen Finkle	LARRY, I feel that, as head of the tenure committee I should tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern. You should not be at all worried. LARRY waits for more. Arlen seems to need a prompt.
F	LARRY	Okay. Arlen Finkle I feel I should mention it even though we won't give this any weight at all in considering whether to grant you tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern.
F	LARRY	Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight? Arlen Finkle We have received some letters, uh... denigrating you, and, well, urging that we not grant you tenure.
F	LARRY	From who?
M	Arlen Finkle	They're anonymous. And so of course we dismiss them completely.
F	LARRY	Well... well... what do they say? Arlen Finkle They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but I'm not really... while we give them no credence, LARRY, I'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the committee's deliberations.
F	LARRY	But... I think you're saying, these won't play any part in your deliberations. Arlen Finkle None at all.
F	LARRY	Um, so what are they... Arlen Finkle Moral turpitude. You could say.
F	LARRY	Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are they-idiomatic? Arlen Finkle I, uh...
F	LARRY	The reason I ask, I have a Korean student, South Korean, disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about this, actually, he- Arlen Finkle No. No, the letters are competently-even eloquently written. A native English-speaker. No question about that.
F	LARRY	Uh-huh. Arlen Finkle But I reiterate this, LARRY: no cause for concern. I only

Its doors swing open and children emerge. Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the lettering, waiting to ferry the children home. We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake. As children and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress engine ominously rumbling. Children start climbing on.
M	MINUTES LATER	Inside the bus, now moving. Engine noise bangs in louder and windows. We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel vehicle bucks. The pitching children. Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays.
M	DANNY	I gotta get my radio back. Ronnie Nudell Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole.
M	DANNY	I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap out of me. Ronnie Nudell Way up his asshole.
M	DANNY	And I'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's records.
M	Howard Altar	How do you buy all those records. Where do you get your funds.
M	CLOSE ON LARRY	Standing in his yard. His eyes are darkly pouched. He is staring in distress. We hear a fluttering sound. His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the Brandts' yard. Red outlines a projection from the side of the house. The loose ends the breeze. Engine noise brings LARRY's look around. A car is arriving. a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling over Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues. Blood shirt.
M	GAR	Go scrub up, Mitch.
F	LARRY	Uh, good afternoon. This brings Gar's look around. Apparently he is unused to talking There is a short beat before his response.
M	GAR	Afternoon. In the background of his angle is the dead buck, staring off . Been hunting?
M	GAR	Yep.
F	LARRY	Is that a, uh... He is indicating the staked area. Gar looks around at it, looks
M	GAR	Gonna be a den.
F	LARRY	Uh-huh, that's great. Uh, Mr. Brandt- Gar barks at Mitch, who has lingered to listen to the grown-ups:
M	GAR	I said scrub up, Mitch! The child quickly goes. LARRY frowns.
F	LARRY	Isn't this a school day?
M	GAR	Took him out of school today. So he could hunt with his
F	LARRY	Oh! He nods. . That's.. . nice. Gar stares at him with button eyes. Small talk is not his thing. . Um, Mr. Brandt, that's just about at the property line,
M	GAR	Property line's the poplar.
F	LARRY	. the. ?
M	GAR	Poplar!
F	LARRY	. Well.. . even if it is, you're just about over it
M	GAR	Measure. We hear two pairs of pounding footsteps coming up the street.
F	LARRY	I don't have to measure, you can tell it's...
M	GAR	Line's the poplar. He indicates. . It's all angles. Gar Brandt turns and goes. LARRY turns, reacting to the pounding footsteps. One of the two who arrives, slowing to a walk, panting, a bookbag over his shoulder. watches, scowling, as DANNY goes up the walk to his house.
F	LARRY	What's going on?
M	DANNY	Nothing.
M	IN THE HOUSE	As LARRY enters. Yeah? Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz? No, I-not yet.
M	LARRY.	Appointment Monday. The thud of a car door outside. SARAH heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket. LARRY is . Where are you going?
F	SARAH	I'm going to the hole.
F	LARRY	At five o'clock? He looks out the front-door window. Four girls of SARAH's age from the car. All have dark hair and big noses.
F	SARAH	We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house so I can wash my hair. LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings. From the

F	LARRY	You can't wash it here? From somewhere in the house, Jefferson Airplane starts.
F	SARAH	Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.
M	VOICE	Out in a minute! Judith enters.
F	JUDITH	Are you ready?
F	LARRY	Huh?
F	JUDITH	We're meeting Sy at Embers.
F	LARRY	I am?
F	JUDITH	Both of us. I told you. LARRY has his arms pinned at his sides by hugging Sy Ableman.
M	SY	LARRY. How are you.
F	LARRY	Sy.
M	SY	Hello Judith.
F	JUDITH	Hello Sy. Once Sy releases LARRY, all seat themselves at Sy's booth, Judith facing.
M	SY	Thank you for coming, LARRY. It's so impawtant that we be
F	LARRY	I'm happy to come to Embers, Sy, but, I'm thinking, really,
M	SY	Of coss! Legal matters, let the lawyers discuss! Don't mix
F	JUDITH	I've beamed you to see the lawyer.
F	LARRY	I told you, I'm going Monday.
M	SY	Monday is timely! This isn't-please!-Embers isn't the forum for legalities, you are so right!
F	JUDITH	Hmph.
M	SY	No, Judith and I thought merely we should discuss the practicalities, the living arrangements, a situation that will conduce to the comfit of all the parties. This is an issue where no one is at odds. LARRY isn't sure where this is leading:
F	LARRY	. Living arrangements.
M	SY	Absolutely. I think we all agree, the children not being contaminated by the tension-the most impawtant.
F	JUDITH	We shouldn't put the kids in the middle of this, LARRY.
F	LARRY	The kids aren't-
F	JUDITH	I'm saying "we." I'm not pointing fingers.
M	SY	No one is playing the "blame game," LARRY.
F	LARRY	I didn't say anyone was!
F	JUDITH	Well let's not play He said, She said, either.
F	LARRY	I wasn't! I. ---
M	SY	Aw right, well let's just step back, and defuse the situation,
M	LARRY.	LARRY glares at Sy. Sy smiles at him, sadly. He reaches over and rests a hand on . I find, sometimes, if I count to ten. A beat. One... two... three... faw... Or silently. Long beat.
F	JUDITH	Really, to keep things on an even keel, especially now,
M	SY	A child's bar mitzvah, LARRY!
F	JUDITH	Sy and I think it's best if you move out of the house.
F	LARRY	. Move out?!
M	SY	It makes eminent sense.
F	JUDITH	Things can't continue as they-
F	LARRY	Move out! Where would I go?!
M	SY	Well, for instance, the Jolly Roger is quite livable. Not
F	JUDITH	This would allow you to visit the kids.
M	SY	There's convenience in its fava. There's a pool- Wouldn't it make more sense for you to move in with Sy? After a long beat:
M	SY	LARRY, you're jesting!
F	JUDITH	LARRY, there is much to accomplish before that can happen.
M	SY	LARRY, LARRY, LARRY. I think, really, the Jolly Roger is the He shrugs. It has a pool. It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid.

The handsome man, hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly which in some fashion addresses him. We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music:
M	DANNY	Stop it!
F	SARAH	Creep fucker!
M	DANNY	Stop it! I'm getting it! I'm gonna get it! Wider shows that the brain is on television, which DANNY has Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah portion. stand-off, hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows.
F	SARAH	Brat! LARRY enters.
F	LARRY	What's going on? Nothing. She closes the door behind her.
F	LARRY	What was that?
M	DANNY	Nothing.
F	LARRY	How's the haftorah coming? Can you maybe use the hi-fi?
M	DANNY	What? We hear the doorbell off. LARRY indicates the portable record Can I borrow this? I'm taking some stuff. To, you know, the Jolly Rodger.
M	DANNY	Sure Dad. On TV, the handsome man shouts defiance at the brain.
F	SARAH	Dad. Chinese guy.

F	LARRY	With all respect, Mr. Park, I don't think it's that. Mr. Park Yes.
F	LARRY	No. It would be a culture clash if it were the custom in your land to bribe people for grades.
M	Mr. Park	Yes.
F	LARRY	So-you're saying it is the custom? Mr. Park No. This is defamation. Grounds for lawsuit.
F	LARRY	You-let me get this straight-you're threatening to sue me for defaming your son? Yes.
F	LARRY	But it would- Gar Brandt Is this man bothering you. Gar Brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two neighbors. Park a hard stare.
F	LARRY	Is he bothering me? No. We're fine. Thank you, Mr. Brandt. Gar Brandt, not entirely convinced, withdraws, glaring at the LARRY turns back to Mr. Park. . I, uh. . See, if it were defamation there would have to be someone I was defaming him to, or I... All right, I... let's keep it simple. I could pretend the money never appeared. That's not defaming anyone.
M	BL	Mr. Park Yes. And passing grade.
F	LARRY	Passing grade. Yes.
F	LARRY	Or you'll sue me. Mr. Park For taking money.
F	LARRY	So.. . he did leave the money. Mr. Park This is defamation. LARRY stares at him.
F	LARRY	Look. It doesn't make sense. Either he left the money or he didn't Mr. Park Please. Accept mystery.
F	LARRY	You can't have it both ways! If Mr. Park Why not. LARRY stares. We hear Sidor Belarsky music. Sidor Belarsky's singing crosses the cut. The tone arm of DANNY's player rides on a spinning LP. Wider shows LARRY grading bluebooks at a small formica table his motel room. It is a depressingly generic budget motel room cheaply paneled walls, thin carpet, formica night tables, plastic with stained nubby bedspreads. The phone rings.
F	LARRY	Hello... He brightens. . Fine, Mimi, how are you?... Uh-huh... No, it's not that bad... It's not that bad... There's a pool... Arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room that mirror and apparently connects to the bathroom. He has a hand back of his neck. . Oh sure, that sounds great. . . Oh, great, then I'll bring
M	LAKE NOKOMIS	The beach: families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater cavorting, adults lounging, much sun, few umbrellas. Red floats rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored Splashing and children's laughter slap off the surface of the
M	WOODS	Above the lake. The beach noise has some distance. It also has echo. There is a present, sybillant shushing of breeze in the It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through on DANNY, who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk. After a very long beat he slowly exhales, a small amount of smoke breath.
M	VOICE	Gimme that fucker. DANNY passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite.
M	PICNIC AREA	On a woodless rise above the lake. Each of the separate picnic table and benches placed next to a firepit. Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell, a man slightly older sweat. Mel, in the background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes the firepit. LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical environment. gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-brimmed
F	LARRY	No. Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him go. He's very good with numbers. I think his, his social
M	MIMI	Such a sweet man though.
F	LARRY	Arthur has a good heart. And he never complains, unlike
M	MIMI	He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this, um...
F	LARRY	The Mentaculus? He says it's a, uh. a probability map. Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish it. Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate. A beat.
M	MIMI	Does he go out socially at all?
F	LARRY	He tries. He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel
M	MIMI	How is Judith?
F	LARRY	Fine. She's fine. I'm the odd man out. Mimi smiles.
M	MIMI	Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be. And it can take a while before you feel what was always there, for better or worse.
F	LARRY	I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue! What does that mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to be another!
M	MIMI	Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are. . I'm sorry-I don't mean to sound glib. It's not always easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you.
F	LARRY	I'll say.
M	MIMI	But it's not something you have to figure out all by your- self. We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on, stories that have been handed down from people who had the same problems.
F	LARRY	I guess.
M	MIMI	Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner? Silence. Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake, dripping wet. He projects:
M	ARTHUR	Boy! The air out here is magnificent! Mimi, looking at LARRY, responds to his dark silence:
M	MIMI	Why not see him? Mel Nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals. He Mimi, draping an arm over her shoulder. She strokes his hand,
F	LARRY	What's the rabbi gonna tell me?
M	MIMI	If I knew I'd be the rabbi. He looks at her glumly. She laughs. . Life is beautiful, LARRY. Nobody's sick. Nobody died. She rests her head against Mel's shoulder. . Where are the kids?
M	MEL	Woods. Exploring. Uncle Arthur approaches, swim trunks plastered to his thighs, pressing his towel to the back of his neck.
M	ARTHUR	If somebody could bottle this air they'd make a million bucks! A white title comes up: The First Rabbi Day. LARRY sits waiting. A door opens and he rises.
F	LARRY	Oh-Rabbi Scott. Rabbi Scott Ginzler is the junior rabbi, a man in his twenties. Hello LARRY.
F	LARRY	I thought I was going to see Rabbi Nachtner. Rabbi Scott He was called away on an etz monim: Ruth Brynn's mother is in the hospital and she isn't doing well. Rabbi Nachtner
M	RABBI SCOTT'S OFFICE	A few minutes later. LARRY sits tensely hunched forward facing
F	LARRY	And she wants a Gett. A long silence. The hum of ventilation. At length: Rabbi Scott A what?
F	LARRY	She wants a- Rabbi Scott Oh, a Gett. Uh-huh, sure.
F	LARRY	I feel like the carpet's been yanked out from under me. I don't know which end is up. I'm not even sure how to react; I'm too confused. Rabbi Scott What reasons did she give? For the rupture?
F	LARRY	She didn't give-reasons. Just that, oh, you know, things haven't been going well. Rabbi Scott And is that true?
F	LARRY	I guess. I don't know. She's usually right about these things.
M	Rabbi Scott	Mm-hm.
F	LARRY	I feel so... addled.
M	Rabbi Scott	Yes, I can see.
F	LARRY	I was hoping that... Rabbi Nachtner... Rabbi Scott That he would... yes?
F	LARRY	Well, with the benefit of his life experience... no
M	OFFENSE-	Rabbi Scott chuckles.
M	Rabbi Scott	No, of course not. I am the junior rabbi. And it's true, the similar problems might be more valid. And you should see the senior rabbi as well, by all means. Or even Minda if something with you? Because I too have had the feeling of losing track of Hashem, which is the problem here. I too that happens you think, well, if I can't see Him, He isn't there any more, He's gone. But that's not the case. You just need to remember how to see Him. Am I right? He rises and goes to the window. I mean, the parking lot here. Not much to see. It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who isn't familiar with these... autos and such... somebody
F	LARRY	Um... Rabbi Scott Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem, you know, reaching into the world. He is in the world, not thing...
F	LARRY	Well, she's, she's seeing Sy Ableman. Oh.
F	LARRY	She's, they're planning, that's why they want the Gett.
M	Rabbi Scott	Oh. I'm sorry.
F	LARRY	It was his idea. Rabbi Scott Well, they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith. But this is life. For you too. You can't cut yourself off from the mystical or you'll be-you'll remain-completely lost. You have to see these things as expressions of God's will. You don't have to like it, of course.
F	LARRY	The boss isn't always right, but he's always the boss. Rabbi Scott Ha-ha-ha! That's right, things aren't so bad. Look at the Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling. . Just look at that parking lot. Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house. footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he as he races up to the house: DANNY. A beat later pursuing feet enter, slowing-for DANNY is already stoop. DANNY's pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in but the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is hulking
M	GOPNIK KITCHEN	We hear the front door being flung open and slammed shut, and DANNY appears, panting heavily. He gives one glance back toward then looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the foreground. wrapped turbanlike around her head. She holds it with one hand off when she tilts her head down for the soup.
M	DANNY	We eating already?
F	SARAH	I'm going to the hole. DANNY enters the kitchen and sits at the setting across from spoon. Some movement in SARAH's body; DANNY recoils from a kick.
M	DANNY	Ow! Cut it out!
F	JUDITH	What's going on? The siblings slurp soup, neither answering. After a couple slurps: . Isn't Dad eating?
F	JUDITH	He's at the Jolly Roger.
M	DANNY	Oh yeah. More eating. In a small windowless conference room lined by bookshelves filled books, LARRY rises to greet Don Milgram, entering.
F	LARRY	Don.
M	DON	How are you, LARRY, Jesus, I am so sorry to be seeing you
F	LARRY	Oh, well...
M	DON	I always thought you and JUDY were rock solid. This is so
F	LARRY	Well, the way I look at it, it's an opportunity for me to routine, tired old way of looking at things. Don Milgram stares at him.
M	DON	. Really? I don't know. Maybe not.
M	DON	Well, legally, I have to warn you, it's never easy for the husband. Unless, of course, there's some question of the
F	LARRY	Oh no, nothing like that. She's planning to marry Sy Ableman, but they-
M	DON	Sy Ableman!
F	LARRY	Yes, but they-

M	DON	Well, okay, still-this changes the complexion, LARRY! Sy

M	VOICE	Hello, Mr. Gopnik, this is Dick Dutton from the Columbia Record Club. I'm calling because it is now, what, four months and we have yet to receive your first payment.
F	LARRY	I-there's some mistake. I'm not a member of the Columbian Record Club.
M	VOICE	Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik of 1425 Flag Avenue South?
F	LARRY	No, I live at the Jolly Roger.
M	VOICE	Excuse me?
F	LARRY	No, I-well, yes, okay.
M	VOICE	Yes you are Lawrence Gopnik?
F	LARRY	Okay.
M	VOICE	Okay means...
F	LARRY	Okay, yes, Lawrence Gopnik, yes.
M	VOICE	Okay, well, you received your twelve introductory albums and you have been receiving the monthly main selection for four months now-
F	LARRY	"The monthly main selection?" Is that a record? I didn't ask for any records.
M	VOICE	To receive the monthly main selection you do nothing.
F	LARRY	That's right! I haven't done anything!
M	VOICE	Yes, that's why you receive the monthly main selection. The last
F	LARRY	But I-
M	VOICE	The last one was Santana Abraxis. You-
F	LARRY	I didn't ask for Santana Abraxis!
M	VOICE	You request the main selection at the retail price by doing and handling. You're about to-
F	LARRY	I can't afford a new record every month! I haven't asked
M	VOICE	You're about to get Cosmo's Factory, sir. The June main selection. And you haven't-
F	LARRY	Look, something is very wrong! I don't want Santana Abraxis! I've just been in a terrible auto accident! Beat.
M	VOICE	I'm sorry sir.
F	LARRY	Well-thank you. But I-
M	VOICE	Are you okay?
F	LARRY	Yes. Yes, no one was hurt.
M	VOICE	Okay. Good. Well, you had fourteen days to listen to Santana Abraxis and return it if you weren't completely satisfied. You did nothing. And now you-
F	LARRY	I didn't ask for Santana Abraxis! I didn't listen to Santana Abraxis! I didn't do anything! The secretary is sticking her head in.
F	SECRETARY	Sir.
M	VOICE	Sir. Please. We can't make you listen to the record. We-
F	SECRETARY	Professor Gopnik, your son. He said it's urgent.
F	LARRY	Okay, look, I have to call you back, this is, this is I'm sorry. He irritably punches a button on the bottom row of four.
M	DANNY	Dad!
F	LARRY	Did you join the Columbia Record Club?! Silence.
M	DANNY	Um...
F	LARRY	DANNY, this is completely unacceptable. I can't afford to-
M	DANNY	Okay Dad, but you gotta come home.
F	LARRY	Is it F Troop?
M	DANNY	Huh? No no. Mom's real upset.
M	GOPNIK HOUSE	LARRY enters. We can hear weeping, semi-hysterical, from somewhere SARAH's Voice .Dad?
F	LARRY	Yes? She enters.
F	SARAH	Does this mean I can't go to the hole tonight?
F	LARRY	Does what mean-what happened?
F	SARAH	Sy Ableman died in a car crash. DANNY's Voice Hey Dad!
F	LARRY	What?! DANNY enters.
M	DANNY	So are you coming back home? Can you fix the aerial?
F	LARRY	What?!
M	DANNY	It's still, you know... Loud wailing.
M	BLACK	After a beat in black, a white title: The Second Rabbi The title fades.
M	RABBI'S OFFICE	We are close on LARRY. He sits hunched forward, hands clasped the floor, sadly shaking his head. After a long beat:
F	LARRY	It seems like she's asking an awful lot. But then-I don't Rabbi Nachtner, sitting opposite, nods. Rabbi Nachtner Uh-huh.
F	LARRY	His own estate is in probate. But why does it have to be Rabbi Nachtner Something like this-there's never a good time.
F	LARRY	I don't know where it all leaves me. Sy's death. Obviously it's not going to go back like it was.
M	Rabbi Nachtner	Mm. Would you even want that, LARRY?
F	LARRY	No, I-well yeah! Sometimes! Or-I don't know; I guess the honest answer is I don't know. What was my life before? Not what I thought it was. What does it all mean? What is Hashem trying to tell me, making me pay for Sy Ableman's funeral? Rabbi Nachtner Mm.
F	LARRY	And-did I tell you I had a car accident the same time Sy had his? The same instant, for all I know. Is Hashem telling me that Sy Ableman is me, or we are all one or something? Rabbi Nachtner How does God speak to us: it's a good question. You know Lee Sussman?
F	LARRY	DOCTOR Sussman? I think I-yeah. Rabbi Nachtner Did he ever tell you about the goy's teeth?
F	LARRY	No... I-What goy? Rabbi Nachtner So Lee is at work one day; you know he has the orthodontic
F	LARRY	Uh-huh.
M	Rabbi Nachtner	Right next to the Gold Eagle Cleaners. We cut to: It dominates a small suburban strip mall. Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we cut to a smoked Leon Sussman, DDS.

Another day: Dr. Sussman is sitting at his desk examining the something unusual. . He notices something unusual. Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses. He flips down the loupe. His eyes are hugely magnified as he Sure enough, it's writing. Sussman squints. His point-of-view: Tiny incised Hebrew letters: smlï¿½nn
M	BACK TO RABBI NACHTNER	He confirms with a nod. Rabbi Nachtner This in a goy's mouth, LARRY.
M	BACK TO LEON SUSSMAN	The Rabbi's narrative continues.
M	Rabbi Nachtner	Tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin. What is that-tiranu linoshets? "Help me"? Is that what it says? Or is it a name? It's not Kraus's name. Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off, haunted. He rises. A dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped hardened tiny letters that stand out in relief, right-side around in the yw .rin Sussman leans back, thinking. He calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional Close on Kraus grinning as he shakes Sussman's hand in the reception gestures to invite Kraus back to the examination room. In the examination room, leaning over Kraus in the chair, the with seeming casualness. Notice any other problems with your teeth? Anything peculiar, et cetera? Sussman takes a dental mirror. No. No. No. Visited any other dentist recently? He looks in Kraus' mouth with the mirror: Ym nn Sussman frowns. There it is. "Help me"? He leans back. Sussman goes home. Can Sussman eat? No. Sussman sits at the kitchen table, untouched food in front of while Sussman stares into space. Can Sussman sleep? No. Sussman is in bed, pyjamas buttoned to the neck, staring at the What does it mean? Is it a message for him, for Sussman? And if so, from whom? Does Sussman know? Sussman doesn't know. Back in the dental office Sussman pulls boxes containing other Sussman looks at the molds of his other patients, goy and looks in his own mouth... Close on Sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the reflection dental mirror he holds in his own mouth. . Nothing. His wife's mouth... Sussman's wife lies asleep on her back, her mouth open, snoring pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place, lies over himself with one arm thrown across her body. He leans awkwardly lowering a dental mirror into his wife's open mouth. The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up. But Sussman is an educated man. Not the world's greatest Sussman, still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table paper. Close on the paper: the Hebrew letters have been transcribed into their numeric Seven digits-a phone number maybe? Sussman reaches for the phone. He hesitates a moment, then dials.
M	AN ELEVATED CUBICLE	In a grocery store. A man in short sleeves reaches for the phone.
M	Rabbi Nachtner	It's a Red Owl grocery store in Bloomington. Hello? Do you know a goy named Kraus? Russel Kraus? The store manager is shaking his head. Where have I called? The Red Owl. In Bloomington. Thanks so much. The manager, puzzled, hangs up. Sussman thinks, am I supposed to go to the Red Owl, to receive a further sign? He goes... In the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed from his car. It is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban It's a Red Owl. Inside Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around. Groceries. What have you. A service alley behind the store: dumpsters, wind-blown garbage, On the wall behind the store, a stain... There is an old, rather nondescript stain of some liquid splatted long since dribbled away. . Could be a nun sofit... Or maybe not... The parking lot again: Sussman gets back in his car. out, if he's ever to sleep again. Sussman again, in pyjamas buttoned to the neck, lies in his bed He goes to see the Rabbi, Nachtner. He comes in and sits Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner, just where sitting. What does it mean, Rabbi? Is it a sign from Hashem? "Help me." I, Sussman, should be doing something to help this goy? Doing what? The teeth don't say. I should know without asking? Or maybe I'm supposed to help people generally-lead a more righteous life? Is the answer in cabalah? In torah? Or is there even a question? Tell me, Rabbi-what can such a sign mean? Nachtner-not the narrating Nachtner but the Nachtner in the scene-nods considers.
F	LARRY	Staring at the Rabbi. He waits a good beat. He prompts:
F	LARRY	So what did you tell him? The Rabbi seems surprised by the question. Rabbi Nachtner Sussman?
F	LARRY	Yes!
M	Rabbi Nachtner	Is it. . relevant?
F	LARRY	Well-isn't that why you're telling me? Rabbi Nachtner Mm. Okay. Nachtner says, look.. . We are back in the scene, narrated by voice-over, of the Rabbi fretful Sussman. . The teeth, we don't know. A sign from Hashem, don't LARRY's voice-over question plays over Sussman asking the same But is that what it meant?-tet resh nun lamed nun shin isayin, was it "Help me"? or a number? Or was it We can't know everything. Sussman stares blankly at the Rabbi. A beat. It sounds like you don't know Mthing!
M	THE RABBI	Smiling equably at LARRY. He reacts to the ejaculation with a LARRY scowls.
F	LARRY	Why even tell me the story? Rabbi Nachtner First I should tell you, then I shouldn't.
F	LARRY	What happened to Sussman?
M	SUSSMAN	In his office. Working on different patients as the Rabbi resumes
M	Rabbi Nachtner	What would happen? Not much. He went back to work. For a while he checked every patient's teeth for new messages; didn't see any; in time, he found he'd stopped checking. Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner. they're like a toothache. We feel them for a while, then they go away. Sussman lies in bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his
F	LARRY	Dissatisfied.
F	LARRY	I don't want it to just go away! I want an answer! Rabbi Nachtner The answer! Sure! We all want the answer! But Hashem
F	LARRY	Why does he make us feel the questions if he's not gonna give us any answers? Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a beat. He hasn't told me. LARRY rubs his face, frustrated. A last question occurs to him:
F	LARRY	And what happened to the goy? Rabbi Nachtner's forebearing smile fades into puzzlement. The goy? Who cares? The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie.
M	VOICE	Sy Ableman was a serious man!
M	RABBI NACHTNER	In close-up he gazes around, weighing the effect of the words After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact audience as possible: Rabbi Nachtner . Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community... Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema. He and the congregation across a casket down at floor level. . to torah study... LARRY sits among the congregants, his gaze fixed on a point off. . to his beloved wife Esther until, three years ago, she LARRY's point-of-view: JUDY is visible from 3 behind. She sits grimly up at the rabbi. . and to his duty, as he saw it. Where does such a man man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous? Could such a serious man... simply... disappear? The words echo. Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer.
M	THEN:	. We speak of L'olam ha-ba, the World to Come. Not heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife. "L'olam ha-ba." What is L'olam ha-ba? Where is L'olam ha-ba? Well: it is not a geoaraphic place, certainly. Like-Canada. Murmured chuckles from the congregation. Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood'vash-the land flowing milk and cookies to eternity! More chuckles. L'olam ha-ba... is in the bosom of Abraham. L'olam ba- ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns. That's without a ripple but Sy Ableman? Sy Ableman was a serious man... A sob echoes through the sanctuary. LARRY looks at Judith, who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief. the dead. It praises Hashem; it praises what abides. And tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah... The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping
M	A HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR	The front door to the Gopnik home. LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens surprise edged with fear. Reverse: two uniformed policemen.
M	COP 1	Arthur Gopnik? LARRY is momentarily dumb. Inside the house we can see a corner the living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men revealing himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith's . Are you Arthur Gopnik?
F	LARRY	I'm... Laurence Gopnik. Cop I Do you go by the name Arthur Gopnik?
F	LARRY	No. Is that Arthur Gopnik? Arthur ducks away. From inside the living room: Dad? What's going on?
F	LARRY	Can you tell me what's going on. We're sitting shiva here.
M	COP 1	You're what.
F	LARRY	A religious observance. We're... bereaved. The cop standing behind gazes in over his partner's shoulder.
M	COP 2	Who died?
F	LARRY	My wife's um... it's a long story.
M	COP 1	Look. Tell Gopnik-you know, Arthur Gopnik-he's breaking the law. We're not arresting him now but next time we will. Gambling is against the law in this state. That's just the way it is. All right. Go back to your...
M	COP 2	Sorry, sir.
M	LIVING ROOM	A minute later. The family-except for Judith, whose weeping continues around the card table. A long beat. At length:
M	DANNY	Dad, we get Channel 4 now but not Channel 7.
F	LARRY	Arthur, how could you do that to this family. On Sy's... on Sy's-
M	ARTHUR	It's a victimless crime.
F	LARRY	That doesn't make it right! And you-
M	DANNY	He won a lot of money, Dad! The Mentaculus really works! LARRY's gaze swings onto his son.
F	LARRY	You knew about it?!
M	DANNY	Well, um...
M	ARTHUR	They must have finked me out. They knew I could just keep on winning, so a couple weeks ago they blackballed me, and now they've-
F	LARRY	What did you do with the money you won? Silence. Arthur sneaks a look at DANNY. LARRY looks back and forth between them. . What's going on? Arthur shrugs.
M	ARTHUR	I didn't want it. DANNY said he could use it
F	SARAH	Unfair!
F	LARRY	What have you been-
M	ARTHUR	What's unfair is these guys saying I can't play in their card
F	SARAH	Why give him the money?! You know what he spends it on?
F	LARRY	I know about the records.
F	SARAH	Records?! You think he buys records from Mike Fagle? Movement in DANNY's body; SARAH recoils from a kick.
F	LARRY	Hey! What's going on!
M	DANNY	At least I'm not saving up for a nose job!
F	LARRY	What?!
F	SARAH	Brat!
F	LARRY	Nobody in this house is getting a nose job! You got that?!
M	DANNY	Ali! Struck by a thought he leaps up and bolts from the room.
F	LARRY	DANNY! You weren't excused! We're still talking!
F	SARAH	What a brat.
F	LARRY	What was this card game, Arthur?
M	ARTHUR	Some goys run a private game. We hear the TV go on down the hall and the theme from F Troop.
F	LARRY	DANNY, what's going on! He rises.
M	BEDROOM	LARRY enters to look down at DANNY's back. Beyond him F Troop
F	LARRY	DANNY! We're sitting Shiva!
M	DON MILGRAM'S OFFICE	LARRY, sitting across from Don, has his head buried in his arms
M	DON	She's retained Barney Silver at Tuchman, Marsh. This is a, Uh-huh.
M	DON	These are not pleasant people. Judith is free of course to
F	LARRY	It's hard. I think she emptied our bank account. I tried to

F	LARRY	She, uh...
M	DON	Yeah, yeah you better open an account in your name only, put your paychecks in there from here on out. Til we know where we stand.
F	LARRY	Can I?
M	DON	Oh, absolutely!
F	LARRY	That's not, um, dishonest?
M	DON	Oh, absolutely! You, uh-
F	LARRY	I hate to say this, but I think she's also been sneaking cash
M	DON	Ouch. Well, yes, this is definitely, um, adversarial. The first thing we-are you all right? LARRY is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve.
F	LARRY	Just a sunburn. I've been spending a lot of time on the roof. For... perspective. He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms. Don look.
M	DON	. Have you seen the Rabbi?
F	LARRY	Talked to Nachtner.
M	DON	You should talk to Minda.
F	LARRY	They told me Minda doesn't do pastoral work any more.
M	DON	Mm. Congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every week, so forth? LARRY nods miserably. . That's too bad. A very wise man, Minda. LARRY raises his head.
F	LARRY	Getting old.
M	DON	Very old.
F	LARRY	No, me. LARRY, you're fine. It's a bump in the road. Was Nachtner helpful at all? LARRY gives a helpless shrug. Don rolls his eyes. . What-did he tell you about the goy's teeth? A knock on the door. Don projects: Yeah? The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a peeking . Oh, good! Sol, come on in. Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders. impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth. the files into three piles. .

LARRY returns a bewildered look. Solomon Schlutz, staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of
M	Solomon Schlutz	Gah! His stare holds. He reddens.

F	SECRETARY	Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.
F	LARRY	Call back.
M	HIS OFFICE	LARRY sits in heavily behind his desk. A beat. He opens the top left desk drawer. He withdraws the bulging white its flap. He runs a finger over the wad of bills.
M	LARRY?	He looks up, startled. Arlen Finkle stands in the doorway. . As you know, the tenure committee meets-are you all right? LARRY sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands.
F	LARRY	I'm... fine.
M	Arlen Finkle	I'm sorry. I know you've hit a rough patch.
F	LARRY	Thank you. I'm fine. He puts the envelope in the desk drawer and closes it. Arlen Finkle Uh-huh. Well. As you know, the tenure committee meets next Wednesday to make its final determinations. If
F	LARRY	Arlen, I am not an evil man! Arlen looks at him, shocked. Arlen Finkle LARRY! Of course not!
F	LARRY	I am not- Arlen Finkle We don't make moral judgments!
F	LARRY	I went to the Aster Art once. I saw Swedish Reverie. Arlen Finkle It's okay, LARRY, we don't need to know! The Tenure
F	LARRY	It wasn't even erotic! Although it was, in a way. Arlen Finkle It's all right, LARRY. Believe me. LARRY calms somewhat.
F	LARRY	. Okay. Arlen Finkle Okay. Okay. We, uh, we decide on Wednesday, so if there's anything you want to submit in support of your tenure application, we should have it by then. That's all. Submit. What. What do you-
M	Arlen Finkle	Well. Anything. Published work. Anything else you've done outside of the institution. Any work that we might not be aware of.
F	LARRY	I haven't done anything. Arlen Finkle Uh-huh.
F	LARRY	I haven't published. Arlen Finkle Uh-huh.
F	LARRY	Are you still getting those letters? Arlen Finkle Uh-huh.
F	LARRY	Those anonymous-
M	Arlen Finkle	Yes, I know. Yes. A beat. LARRY nods.

The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever really know... what's going on. A bell sounds. The students start to shake off their stupor and the wallah: . So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on the mid-term. The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated: He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka. LARRY does not seem surprised to see him. . Did you follow that?
M	Sy Ableman	Of coss. Except that I know what's going on. How do you explain.
F	LARRY	Well, it might be that, in, you know, in L'olam ha-bah- Sy Ableman Excuse me. Not the issue. In this world, LARRY. He nods at the chalkboard. . I'll concede that it's subtle. It's clevva. But at the end
F	LARRY	Well-yes it's convincing. It's a proof. It's mathematics. Excuse me, LARRY. Mathematics. Is the art of the possible.
F	LARRY	I don't think so. The art of the possible, that's... I can't remember... something else... Sy Ableman I'm a serious man, LARRY.
F	LARRY	I know that. So if I've got it wrong, what do I- Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him. Sy Ableman So simple, LARRY. See Minda.

F	LARRY	Very close on his eyes as they open. His head is on a pillow. sound. LARRY looks blearily over. On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits evacuator. Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom hisses.
M	MEZUZA	On a doorpost. A hand enters to knock. A long beat. The person knocking gives start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse. the door.
M	WOMAN	Mr. Gopnik.
F	LARRY	Oh. Hello, Mrs. Samsky. I knocked, and then thought you weren't here. I, uh... Mrs. Samsky's voice is soft and breathy: Mrs. Samsky It just took me a second to get to the door. I was out back. He seems to need prompting. Mrs. Samsky does: . Can I help you? Wanna come in?
F	LARRY	No, I- One hand on the door, she steps back.
M	Mrs. Samsky	It's cooler.
F	LARRY	Oh. Okay. I just wanted to let you know... He is entering.
M	INSIDE	After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler. LARRY room, dim but neat. Wavering light sifts through closed vertical click over floor-vented air-conditioning. Mrs. Samsky closes the door, shutting out all sound from outside.
F	LARRY	I've noticed that Mr. Samsky isn't around, and I- Mrs. Samsky He travels.
F	LARRY	Uh-huh. Yeah, I never seem to see him, so I thought I should let you know, since you're somewhat new here, if you ever have, whatever, chores that you'd, um, or just help with something-I've decided to help others-you know, in a neighborly way... She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for silence. In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of still. Finally, only her mouth moves:
M	Mrs. Samsky	How thoughtful. LARRY shrugs off the compliment.
F	LARRY	Oh it's nothing. It's just good to know your neighbors. Mrs. Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding. . Goys, aren't they?
F	LARRY	Mm. Very much so. Maybe it's not fair to judge; I have to admit I- Mrs. Samsky Won't you sit down?
F	LARRY	Oh! Um. Okay. Thank you.
M	Mrs. Samsky	Iced tea? I have some. She is already turning to the kitchen.
F	LARRY	Okay.. . He watches her and reacts to: The backs of her thighs. The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out: Mrs. Samsky I don't see you around much, either.
F	LARRY	Yes. Actually I haven't been home a lot recently, I, uh, my wife and I are, uh, well, she's got me staying at the Jolly Mrs. Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds. Mrs. Samsky You're in the doghouse, huh? She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him, not leg folded onto the couch, the other draped over it.
F	LARRY	Yeah, that's an understatement I guess, I -thank you-I, Mrs. Samsky Do you take advantage of the new freedoms? LARRY stares at her. Mrs. Samsky gazes back. Her look displays
F	LARRY	. What do you mean. Her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and opens table. She turns back with a joint.
M	Mrs. Samsky	It's something I do. For recreation. She lights it.
F	LARRY	That's... Marijuana? Mrs. Samsky Mm-hmm. She hands the joint over. . You'll find you'll need the iced tea. LARRY handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation.
F	LARRY	Is it. . well.. . okay...
M	THE VERTICAL BLINDS	Some minutes later. They drift and click in the air blown from LARRY stares at them. After a long beat:
F	LARRY	Maybe Rabbi Scott was right. Mrs. Samsky Who's Rabbi Scott?
F	LARRY	The junior rabbi. Mrs. Samsky The junior rabbi. Another long beat. Neither person feels compelled to speak as The joint makes another trip back and forth.
M	THEN:	. What did he say?
F	LARRY	He spoke of.. perception. All my problems are just... just a... a mere.. He trails off, listening. . Is that a siren? Mrs. Samsky No. Some people get a little paranoid when they... Holy cow... That is a siren.
M	OUTSIDE	The Samsky's door opens and LARRY stumbles out. He stares. cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in LARRY, stunned, walks woodenly toward his house.
F	LARRY	Hey! Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard. They have rung the doorbell and now disappear inside. LARRY projects louder- -and starts to sprint. Mrs. Samsky has emerged from her house LARRY takes the stoop steps two at a time. His door stands open Troop issues from within. Just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us and in between. The three men face DANNY, who addresses them, projecting from the TV.
M	DANNY	Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.
F	LARRY	This is crazy! This brings the cops' look around. Uncle Arthur also turns, shamefaced,
M	COP	Does this man live here?
M	ARTHUR	I didn't know what to tell them! They asked for my address.. .
F	LARRY	It's just mathematics! You can't arrest a man for mathematics!
M	ARTHUR	I didn't know whether to say I lived here or at the Jolly
M	COP	You know this man?
M	ARTHUR	I figured this would sound more... I don't know...
M	DANNY	Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs?
F	LARRY	It's all a mistake. I mean, not a mistake, a, a-
M	ARTHUR	Hello, Mrs. Samsky.
F	LARRY	-a miscarriage-
M	COP	Does this man live here?
M	DANNY	He sleeps on the couch.
F	LARRY	Look! What did he do!
M	ARTHUR	Nothing! I didn't do anything!
M	DANNY	It folds out. Dad sleeps on a cot.
F	LARRY	You can't just-
M	COP	Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota. LARRY is brought up short.
F	LARRY	The North Dakota!
M	ARTHUR	But I didn't do anything!
M	DANNY	Dad, what's the North Dakota?
M	COP	Solicitation. Sodomy. Very serious. . The North Dakota! We hold on LARRY's shocked reaction as we hear DANNY, off:
M	DANNY	What's Sodomy, Dad?
M	DON MILGRAM	He wears a black armband. He sits thinking, bouncing steepled
M	DON	What does Arthur say?
F	LARRY	He says he didn't do anything.
M	DON	Uh-huh.
F	LARRY	He says. . . he just went in for a drink.
M	DON	Uh-huh. Long beat. . Does Arthur drink?
F	LARRY	No.
M	DON	Uls-huh.
F	LARRY	. He says he was confused.
M	DON	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well. The North Dakota. Well. You'll need a criminal attorney.
F	LARRY	Okay. Who's-
M	DON	Ron Meshbesher.
F	LARRY	Is he good?
M	DON	Ron is very good. LARRY's gaze wanders. He becomes wistful.
F	LARRY	I don't understand. He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.
M	DON	Mm. A beat. . I would call Ron Meshbesher.
F	LARRY	Is he expensive?
M	DON	Ron is not cheap. Don focuses on LARRY. Cheerful change of subject:
F	LARRY	
M	DON	This shabbas! Great! He nods. . It'll be okay. Try to relax, LARRY. Try to relax.
M	MRS. SAMSKY'S BEDROOM	LARRY is making strenuous love to Mrs. Samsky. Mrs. Samsky So good... so good... She rolls on top of LARRY to straddle him and, still humping, cigarette. LARRY moans.
F	LARRY	Oh my God, Mrs. Samsky... Beyond her head LARRY can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn. Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening. . Who is it? Footsteps are approaching along the hall. Mrs. Samsky doesn't down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and CLIVE wearing a traffic mask. LARRY is mortified: Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY's eyes. The screen goes black. His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place of hammer on nailhead. In the black: Nailing it down is so impawtant. We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting drums a steady rhythm. Grace Slick's voice enters: "Somebody the vocals right before the chorus: Mrs. Samsky's Voice It's something we do. For recreation. On the chorus downbeat, a crescent moon pops into the black. sky, pushing his lawn mower. A cow flies the opposite way. Stars man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder, a bindlestick LARRY bolts upright in bed. Sudden quiet. Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel room's other bed.
F	LARRY	He stands looking down in low shot. Above him is cheap Johnson-Armstrong ceiling.
F	LARRY	Please. I need help. I've already talked to the other rabbis. Reverse shows an elderly eastern European woman seated behind
M	LARRY.	. I won't take much of his time. I need help. I need Minda. It's not about DANNY's bar mitzvah. My boy name it. This is not a frivolous request. This is a serious- I'm a serious-I'm, uh, I've tried to be a serious man. You know, tried to do right, be a member of the community, involved. But you don't have to tell Minda that. Just tell him I need help. Please. I need help. He lapses into silence, staring at the secretary. She stares inscrutably back. After a moment she rises, goes to the door behind her, opens of an inner office. LARRY cranes to see past her. Her own body and the dimness interfere of the figure hunched behind the desk. The man is old and bent. Murmured voices in Hebrew. A clock ticks in the outer office. LARRY looks around, waiting. The old woman is shuffling back. She closes the door on the motionless down, heavily, behind her own desk.
F	SECRETARY	The rabbi is busy.
F	LARRY	He didn't look busy! As she starts shuffling papers:
F	SECRETARY	He's thinking.
M	NIGHT	Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. We are booming down on LARRY, asleep in bed. We hear weeping, soft, suppressed. LARRY stirs. He opens his eyes. After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping. He looks over.
F	LARRY	Arthur... ? Arthur? Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed. His weeping continues. No answer. . Arthur. It'll be okay. Arthur. We'll get Ron Meshbesher. It'll be okay- Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret. shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of

M	COURTYARD	The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained. Its white concrete and weedy. Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure. Arthur! He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur. Arthur is suddenly angry. His voice bounces off the concrete:
M	ARTHUR	It's all shit, LARRY! It's all shit!
F	LARRY	Arthur. Don't use that word.
M	ARTHUR	It's all fucking shit!
F	LARRY	Arthur! Come on!
M	ARTHUR	Look at everything Hashem has given you! And what do I get! I get fucking shit!
F	LARRY	Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly Roger.
M	ARTHUR	You've got a family. You've got a job. Hashem hasn't given me bupkes.
F	LARRY	It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur. Please. Sometimes -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your- self. Don't blame me! You fucker!
F	LARRY	Arthur. Please.
M	ARTHUR	Hashem hasn't given me shit. Now I can't even play cards. He starts weeping again. LARRY looks around.
F	LARRY	Arthur. This isn't the right forum. Please. Not by the pool. Arthur weeps. Arthur... It's okay... It's okay...
M	MORNING	LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are looking at the two of them windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection. day.
F	LARRY	Is this it? Both men peer out.
M	ARTHUR	I think so... yeah... there... He indicates the road ahead.

M	BOUNDARY WATERS	Beautiful, wooded, remote. The car is parked at water's edge, having backed down a lane through the undergrowth. LARRY and Arthur are lowering the canoe
F	LARRY	Okay.. . He straightens. Arthur straightens. LARRY hugs him. .Look... They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope from his pocket . This'll help you get back on your feet. Arthur looks into the envelope.
M	ARTHUR	Oh my God. Where did you get this?
F	LARRY	Doesn't matter. When you-
M	ARTHUR	This is a lot of money!
F	LARRY	It should get you started. This is a lot of money! Are you sure you don't need it?
F	LARRY	Arthur, I'm fine. Come on, get in. When you're settled... Arthur climbs into the canoe. . let me know how to get in touch. He helps push the boat off. Arthur is twisted around, looking
M	ARTHUR	Are you sure this is okay?
F	LARRY	It's fine. It's fine... LARRY waves. Arthur waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars. A turns back again with a last thought. He calls:
M	ARTHUR	LARRY. I'm sorry. What I said last night.
F	LARRY	I know. It's okay. A lingering look from Arthur, and then he turns back to row. Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthur's neck. He slumps forward, dead.
M	VOICE	Good shot! LARRY looks wildly around. He sees: Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering his rifle. us: There's another Jew, son. Mitch swings his rifle toward us. He fires.
F	LARRY	Gasping awake in the motel room. He looks around. It is dawn. Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear, staring vacant-eyed, drained. LARRY gazes around the room, waiting for things to fall into Finally, blearily:
F	LARRY	Were we... out at the pool last night? Arthur, still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice:
M	ARTHUR	Yes. I'm sorry. LARRY blinks sleep away. After a beat:
F	LARRY	It's shabbas. Another beat. Arthur heaves a deep sigh.
M	ARTHUR	I'll go drain my cyst.
M	RESTROOM	Day. A two-urinal, two-stall men's room of old tile and yellowed We are low. One of the stall doors is closed. Under it we see pants of two young men standing inside. We hear a long sucking inhale. Ronnie Nudell's Voice Gimme that fucker. A loudly projected echoing male voice:
M	VOICE	Ya'amod hab'rayshit.
M	SANCTUARY	DANNY, seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister and shuffles along the row to the aisle. His eyes are wide and The prelapped voice was his call to the torah. All eyes in the the large sanctuary, are on him. In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the lectern, rolling them, pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls tsitsim. They pay DANNY no attention. DANNY takes his place centered behind the lectern. His chin comes the reading platform. Men continue to mutter prayers around him. A pair of hands appear from behind. DANNY looks down at the strange hands. They pull A foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern. Booming up on the torah scrolls, still being busily rolled. The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into DANNY's hand. The a red silken tassel. DANNY looks at the bouncing tassel. He looks at the little pointing business end of the yad. Men mutter around him, each a different prayer. They dip and DANNY watches himself point the yad down at the scroll.
M	VOICE	Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot... Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place The voice repeats: . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot... In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and parents. He returns DANNY's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare. . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot... From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him. He looks Youssele Rosenblatt. . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot.. . yad points. . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa- DANNY suddenly erupts:
M	DANNY	Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot. .
M	PROMPTER	Mm-hm. DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion. He moves the yad letters. In the congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm.
F	JUDITH	I'm sorry that... things have been so hard for us...
F	LARRY	It's okay.
F	JUDITH	Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY. He pats her hand. A beat. . He wrote letters to the tenure committee.
M	LATER	The congregation is loudly singing V'Zos Hatorah. A tallised hoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high, turning congregation so that all may see it. DANNY has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply sweating. The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath:

M	MINDA	When the truth is found. To be lies. He pauses. He clears his throat. At length: . And all the hope. Within you dies. Another beat. DANNY waits. Minda stares. He smacks his lips again. .

Jorma... somethin. These are the membas of the Airplane. He nods a couple of times. . Interesting. He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer. He takes something the bare desk and pushes it partway across. . Here. It is DANNY's radio. . Be a good boy. LARRY is at his desk sorting through mail. Arlen Finkle (off DANNY was magnificent.

M	HEBREW SCHOOL CORRIDOR	Distant thunder at the cut. We are tracking behind Minda's female Caliban as she walks down shuffling. She holds a stack of papers in one hand. Mail in front of him. He opens an envelope from RONALD MESHBESHER, ESQ. Underneath is an invoice. The amount: $3,000.

Next to it is an F. He erases the F. He enters a C. The pencil leaves frame. We hold for a beat on the new grade. The hand withdraws. LARRY closes the file. Just as he does so: The phone jangles, very harsh. LARRY looks at it, frozen. He lets it ring a couple times. He reaches for it. He slowly picks it up.
