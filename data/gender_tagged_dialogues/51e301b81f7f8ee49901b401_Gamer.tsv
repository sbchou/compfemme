F	SANDRA	Sandra. My name is Sandra.
M	GUARD	Shut the fuck up. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 1
F	SANDRA	Putcher dick away...
M	GUARD	Get some. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 4 WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 7
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Eat shit please. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 8 Can't say I didn't try...
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Shit! Shit! Suckage. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 11
M	VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)	... what the...!
M	BLUE SOLDIER 1	Good run, Kable.
M	KABLE	My name's Tillman. Whatever your name is. You got to the save point fast.
M	BROWN SOLDIER 2	So the fuck what? No one's getting out of here alive.
M	BLUE SOLDIER 1	I am. I'm going to make it.
M	BROWN SOLDIER 2	Sure you will.
M	BLUE SOLDIER 1	They say you only got three battles left til you get out... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 could ever touch it.
M	OFFSCREEN VOICE	Counting down five... four... three... two...
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	Do we have the damn interview or don't we? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 17
M	PRODUCER	We're cunt hair close -
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	I can't blow off the Three-Asian War for "close".
M	PRODUCER	All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead Orientals... they care about Ken Castle -
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	May I hear from Gina please?
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	OK, Bob? Bob. You realize Castle has clocked exactly - one - media appearance to date and that was Walters' last interview before she died - NINE FUCKING YEARS AGO!
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	Stop menstruating, just tell me we fucking have it -
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	We fucking have it!
M	GINA PARKER SMITH (cont'd)	Palindromes. Hold on. Focus: let's get lunch. Sushi, Iranian, or Mexican?
M	PRODUCER	Burger chili fry?
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I'll freak a burger. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 18
M	VOICEOVER	First... there was society...
M	VOICEOVER (cont'd)	We all remember the slogan. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 18
M	VOICEOVER (cont'd)	The creation of reclusive genius Ken Castle, society took the world by storm, becoming the number one guilty pleasure of billions, either playing or watching... and generating one of the world's largest private fortunes, surpassing Steve Jobs and Bill Gates practically overnight.
M	KEN CASTLE	I ain't complainin'!
M	VOICEOVER	Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess... and controversy - SLAYERS. If society let us live thru others... SLAYERS would let us die thru others. Slayers gives the gamer full control of a flesh and blood human being in full scale, kill-or-be- killed combat. And when we say flesh and blood, we mean flesh - WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 ... and blood.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Slayers.
M	KEN CASTLE	Slayers.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Why isn't it murder?
M	KEN CASTLE	Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I see - and has any one of these men or women ever actually survived long enough to be set free? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 19
M	KEN CASTLE	I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.
M	PRODUCER	What'd he say?
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	... in an election tainted by suspected digital fraud... let's talk about the so-called generi-cons. Sent into the slayers environment with a set of pre-programmed actions, with no way to react and no one controlling them - their chances of survival are next to nil.
M	KEN CASTLE	There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 21
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Right...
M	SUPERNOVA FLARE	TO:
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Mr. Castle - how the hell does it work?
M	KEN CASTLE	Simple. It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies... ... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 23
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Geek, geek, geek - come on, Castle, you promised us a demonstration.
M	KEN CASTLE	Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see...
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Oh... my god. So cute.
M	KEN CASTLE	You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I beg your pardon?
M	PRODUCER	This motherfucker is off the charts.
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	You realize he could buy our network.
M	PRODUCER	Why would he? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 24 Son of a bitch can pull 650 million pay-per-views for a single broadcast.
M	BOARD OP	That's fuckin scary.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Isn't it true that each human that undergoes the procedure will have a distinct IP address -- like a notebook computer or mobile device?
M	KEN CASTLE	Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments. You take Society for instance: once a cast member leaves the workplace they are completely free from the control and monitoring of their player.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	That's a relief.
M	KEN CASTLE	To some, maybe... to some... don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of control?
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I don't... um... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 25
M	KEN CASTLE	Someone else making all the decisions for you... no responsibilities, no tough choices... think about it.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	We will, Mr. Castle. We will.
M	KEN CASTLE	Good little talk.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	My pleasure. Shit, can I tell you? I CAN. NOT. wait for the next Slayers. Kable has been unbelievable. His arms are just so... well, I know it's awful.
M	PRODUCER	What the hell is that? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 27
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue.
M	PRODUCER	Mr. Castle, we have no idea...
M	KEN CASTLE	Shush!
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	That's a God damn hoot.
M	PRODUCER	Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes... Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 27
M	KEN CASTLE	Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall.
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	What about your firewall, sugar - wonder if I might breach it one of these sunny days.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	You're bad.
M	BOARD OP	He's good.
M	PORN GIRL	Wanna blow off a little steam?
M	DISTINCTIVE PRISONER *	Fuck him up. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 28 WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	FREEK	Kable. Kable.

M	FREEK (cont'd)	Spooky. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 31 Why they put you in here, Tillmans?
M	KABLE	I killed my best friend.
M	PRISONER	Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams... You want to get back to them. It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.
M	KABLE	Who's talking?
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	Sign it.
M	KABLE	What? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 32 Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you. Need to prove it's authentic. Makes it worth more.
M	KABLE	Why would anyone want my name? You don't even know what's going on out there, do you? Damn... Gotta go.
M	KABLE	Wait. How did you get this picture? Have you seen them? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 32 WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 39

M	SIMON	Daddy like...
M	ANNOYING GIRL	Simon!
M	SIMON	Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
M	ANNOYING GIRL	You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed.
M	SIMON	Uh huh.
M	CUTE STONED GIRL	Simon, I just wanna play you. Forget about that star-fucker.
M	ANNOYING GIRL	Shut up bitch. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 53
M	CUTE STONED GIRL	Thanks baby. When can I meet you for like reals?
M	SIMON	What is that? Aaaa. Woah.
M	CUTE STONED GIRL	You like me?
M	SHELLY	What's up, loser?
M	SIMON	Hey sissy.
M	SHELLY	Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.
M	SIMON	Wanna make out?
M	SHELLY	You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (3) 53
M	TWINS	Simon?
M	SIMON	Maybe.
M	TWINS	Oh my god, it's really you!!!
M	SIMON	Nice.
M	TWINS	Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?
M	SIMON	Uh, sure.
M	TWIN 1	Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse.
M	SIMON	Here we go.
M	TWIN 2	Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice.
M	SIMON	Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.
M	TWIN 1	Baby... make it a hundred.
M	SIMON	It's been real. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (4) 53
M	SIMON (cont'd)	D'oh. What the fuh...? Um. But there are several other very important differences Between human beings and animals That you should know about... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 54 So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 55
M	GUY	Hey.
M	GORGE	Hi.

M	FEMALE NEWS HOST (V.O.)	... a new video prank by the subversive group humanz caused a nationwide stir today...
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	All contact between Society City and an estimated quarter of a million players was shut down for over three hours while Castle techs worked to remove what they described as a "Satellite Infection"... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 61
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST (cont'd)	Experts estimate that the service interruption may end up costing K- Soft billions in lost revenue.
M	NEWS CO-HOST	Don't cry for Castle, he can cover that with the change under his couch cushions...
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	On a personal note - that shit was fucking freaky.
M	NEWS CO-HOST	Oh - I literally pissed myself.
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	Sounds like fun.
M	NEWS CO-HOST	Serious, these humanz cocksuckers are getting out of control, and someone should do something.
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	Moving on to international headlines...
M	ASIAN PRISONER	GET IT OUT OF ME...! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 62
M	GUARD	What the hell happened to this one?
M	LIFER	Look like he escaped.
M	GUARD	Back to your Jazzercise, girls... eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.
M	KABLE	Freak.
M	FREEK	Tillmans.
M	KABLE	Who the hell is that?
M	FREEK	New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 62
M	HISPANIC GUARD (O.C.)	Hey Kable.
M	HISPANIC GUARD (cont'd)	Let's go. Upgrades.
M	HISPANIC GUARD	Who aims?
M	KABLE	What?
M	HISPANIC GUARD	Who aims... the slayer? Or the player?
M	KABLE	Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye.
M	HISPANIC GUARD	That's tripped. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 63
M	KABLE	Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way.
M	HISPANIC GUARD	Why?
M	KABLE	There's a delay...
M	HISPANIC GUARD	Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping...
M	KABLE	Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls -
M	KABLE (cont'd)	It's just me.
M	HACKMAN	Hey. Kable. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 64
M	KABLE	Not interested.
M	HACKMAN	No. Wait. Look.
M	HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)	I just deleted someone.
M	HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)	This is the blood. Look.
M	HACKMAN (cont'd)	He's back here. Want to see?
M	KABLE	Your head ain't on straight.
M	HACKMAN	I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday.
M	KABLE	Yeah, probably.
M	HACKMAN	That's why they put me here.
M	HACKMAN (cont'd)	I've got no strings... So I have fun... I'm not tied up to anyone... They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 64 You got two whores, Kable...
M	KABLE	- the fuck did you say?
M	HACKMAN	On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first...
M	CASTLE	He's so perfect.
M	CASTLE 2	He's scary. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 65
M	CASTLE	Yeah...
M	CASTLE (cont'd)	The new face of Slayers. Pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red... He's so what they want.
M	CASTLE 2	But they love Kable.
M	CASTLE 3	He's right.
M	CASTLE	They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view.
M	CASTLE 2	How can you be sure?
M	CASTLE	It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...
M	CASTLE 3	Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 65
M	CASTLE	Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con...
M	CASTLE 2	Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect?
M	CASTLE 3	His instincts give him an edge.
M	CASTLE 2	And in the hands of a talented player...
M	CASTLE 3	Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him.
M	CASTLE 2	Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... You know, off camera?
M	CASTLE	YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down.
M	CASTLE 3	One thing I know is what makes people tick. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Kable, dude. It's me.
M	KABLE	Who?
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Simon. I'm playing you, dummy.
M	KABLE	How come I can hear you? It's a mod. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 70
M	KABLE	Gamers can't talk to cons. I know.
M	SIMON	It's cool, yeah?
M	KABLE	No. Pay attention to the game.
M	BLUE SOLDIER 4	This is real, this is real, this is real!!!! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 74
M	SIMON (O.S.)	That was sick.
M	KABLE	Wait a minute... are you twelve?
M	SIMON (O.S.)	I'm nineteen.
M	KABLE	Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet?
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.
M	FREEK	Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint...
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Gibs.
M	KABLE	What?
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks. Pieces. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 74
M	KABLE	These are real humans, fucker. Death row psychos, so what? They had it coming.
M	KABLE	Guess that goes for me too.
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Yeah, but you're different.
M	KABLE	Different how? Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY psycho.
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Damn, new area.
M	KABLE	That way. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 76
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run. It's going to suck to see it end.
M	KABLE	Are you kidding me?
M	SIMON	Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different.
M	KABLE	We should go that way.
M	SIMON (O.S.)	There's nothing there.
M	KABLE	Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple.
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 77
M	SIMON (O.S.)	... shit shit shit!
M	HACKMAN	Bye Kable. What happened? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 79
M	KABLE	Kid's gonna get me killed.
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Hey.
M	KABLE	Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me.
M	SIMON	What the hell...?
M	KABLE	Turn me loose, kid. You want to win, turn me loose.
M	SIMON	But-
M	KABLE	Find a way. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	FREE	And then: ORDER NOW! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	CASEWORKER	So... Miss Roth. Why are we here today... says you'd like to apply for custody of your child-
F	ANGIE	Delia. Her name is Delia.
M	CASEWORKER	Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.
F	ANGIE	My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon...
M	CASEWORKER	Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive.
M	CASEWORKER (cont'd)	You're... an actor? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 85 Not sure if I've seen you in anything.
F	ANGIE	I work in society.
M	CASEWORKER	Acting, is that what they call it?
F	ANGIE	It's a job.
M	CASEWORKER	Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything. I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?
F	ANGIE	Yes, I do. I'm her mother.
M	CASEWORKER	We will give your application all the consideration that it merits. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 86
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	You like the software?
M	SIMON	Software...
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	The walkie talkie, playa.
M	SIMON	No shit... you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said?
M	SIMON	To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha?
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?
M	SIMON	You were listening.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game.
M	SIMON	Alright, then. Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know.
M	SIMON	Huh? What things? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 86
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out... Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen.
M	SIMON	One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit.
M	SIMON	This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Mm hm. That's right, it's a game. You want to win it, don't you?
M	SIMON	Yeah, dude, I intend to.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa. Imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? A trained killing machine... operating in real time, on pure instinct. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (3) 86
M	SIMON	That... would be cheating.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit.
M	SIMON	Uhhh...
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me?
M	SIMON	I do. I do feel you.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Then let's rock, baby. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 88
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	Tillman.
M	KABLE	You. We know you talked to him... your Player.
M	KABLE	You're not a guard... who are you?
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	A friend.
M	KABLE	I don't have any. Listen to me: Simon's going to give you what you want. What you asked him for.
M	KABLE	How do you know that?
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it.
M	KABLE	We'll see. No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way.
M	KABLE	I need you to get me something. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 88 What, Kable... what can I get you?
M	KABLE	Drunk.
M	VOICE (O.C.)	What's he got there?
M	VOICE (cont'd)	Kable, what the hell is that?! Fuck-face - remove the `molotov' from your pants and discard into the recycle bin, now! PUT IT DOWN! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 89
M	SIMON (O.S.)	I can see turning you loose was a great idea.
M	KABLE	What happened. YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it.
M	KABLE	No shit... Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up... What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 91 This is unbelievable. Fuck it. Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together!
M	KABLE	Blow me.
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Dammit! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 93 Kable. Dude. What are you doing? What the hell? GO, GO, GO!
M	KABLE	Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin cheerleader? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 93
M	HACKMAN	Fuuuuck!!!! Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!! WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	SIMON	Um.
M	KABLE	Ughh, that was the one. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 102
M	SIMON	Shit, shit, SHIT! I'm dead. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	FEMALE VOICE	Please stand by... Please stand by... Please stand by...
M	FRAT GUY	What just happened?
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	To recap: initial reports are that Kable, the most recognizable face of the Slayers phenomenon next to Ken Castle himself - is officially listed as fragged...
M	NEWS CO-HOST	That's bullshit.
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	... just one session away from being the first slayer ever to win a full pardon and release. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 111
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST	In a NETCAST plagued by technical difficulties and dead spots the report could NOT be confirmed - however KABLE - born John Tillman of Albany, New York and convicted of murder just four years ago - has been removed from Slayers rosters and upcoming events listings.
M	FEMALE NEWS HOST (cont'd)	His player, gaming megastar Simon Silverton - could not be reached for comment.
F	TRACE	She's not home. But Castle's personal security will be, soon enough - trust me, you don't want to meet them. You know, it's pretty obvious that you'd come here first.
M	KABLE	Who are you?
F	TRACE	You asked me that once before. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 112
M	KABLE	Your voice...
F	TRACE	You should really come with me...
M	TRACE (cont'd)	... like, NOW.
M	adult xxx video	3D-ID novelty toy
F	TRACE	Hang on. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 116
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	You a fool.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	It's a game of deception.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Whatever, that's cuz you got no power... Huh? What?
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Bullshit.
M	KABLE	You guys suck. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 117
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Kable. Holy shit.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	His name's Tillman.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Whatever. You made it. You're really here.
M	KABLE	You're the ones who broke me out?
F	TRACE	We only freed your mind.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Your ass followed.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Hey, Kable...
M	HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)	You're... great.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	You got questions.
M	KABLE	A few.
M	KABLE (cont'd)	She took my blood. Why?
M	HUMANZ DUDE	The nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 we can crack it, but it's not one size fits all; we needed your DNA to generate custom code.
M	KABLE	Alright. Why me?
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Because Castle's scared of you.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human.
F	TRACE	Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	But this is only the beginning.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line.
F	TRACE	So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again...
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.
F	TRACE	The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (3) 117
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Hell no.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves.
F	TRACE	We can't let that happen.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Gotta bring the man down.
F	TRACE	You can help us, Tillman. You have to help us.
M	KABLE	I can't help you.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Tillman. We know where she is.
M	AGENT KEITH	Guess you remember that day. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 118 You'd just gotten Kable through his tenth consecutive session alive... no one ever thought an I-con could last that long.
M	AGENT KEITH (cont'd)	Pretty hot shit, aren't you? King Player.
M	SIMON	Good times.
M	AGENT KEITH	Sure. On the outside. Now look at these. This is what it's like on the inside. Wonder how long you'd last on the other side of the screen.
M	AGENT KEITH (cont'd)	Simon, you're being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary. The charge is... beyond serious. Your hard drives have been seized - forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak. Your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute, vivid detail... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 118 In addition, your father's bank accounts have been frozen pending further investigation - naturally, seeing it was his money that essentially funded Mr. Tillman's escape. I'm going to need you to tell me everything that happened leading up to yesterday afternoon. Everyone you talked to, everything you heard, everything you did. I need you to do that... right now.
M	SIMON	Yeah, um... I need something too.
M	AGENT KEITH	Do you now? And what might that be?
M	SIMON	Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape.
M	AGENT KEITH	Pistachio. They make that?
M	SIMON	It's awesome. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 119
M	BARTENDER	The usual? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 121
M	RICK RAPE	Hi Nika.
F	ANGIE	Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?
M	ANGIE (cont'd)	I thought you weren't allowed to come here anymore.
M	RICK RAPE	That was just last month. I was a bad boy.
F	ANGIE	Are you still a bad boy? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 123
M	RICK RAPE	Urkk.
M	GORGE/ANGIE	Please don't kill me.
M	GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd)	I'll do anything.
M	KABLE	Don't say that. Stop. This isn't you. God damn it... YOU - in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 123
M	GORGE/ANGIE	I can't. She has to say what I tell her.
M	KABLE	You can hear me, baby. I know you can. I love you... love you...
M	GORGE/ANGIE	I love you too.
M	KABLE	SHUT UP!!!
M	KABLE (cont'd)	Say anything else and I'll find you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING PIECES, do you understand me? I'm getting you out of here.
M	KABLE	I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 124
M	HACKMAN	Hi, Kable.
M	HACKMAN	Anybody in there?
M	GORGE/ANGIE	Come on... do it... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 126
M	KABLE	YOU! WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 128 CITY...
M	KABLE	You. Run. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 131
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I can get you out.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I can't believe it's you. This is... Listen: you can trust me, Kable.
M	KABLE	If not... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 135
M	KABLE (cont'd)	You're dead.
M	KABLE	Now what?
M	HUMANZ DUDE	The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	It's an anti-spyware program.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Fuck that. I'd make you cut it out of me.
F	TRACE	That would be like cutting out part of your brain. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 136 The nanocells replace the cells they replicate... they become you.
M	KABLE	How long will she sleep?
F	TRACE	We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link... otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or hears.
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Thirty minutes... you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot human.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Tillman. We need to talk, my man.
M	KABLE	So talk.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Come on.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER (V.O.)	Ken Castle made his first billion designing virtual reality simulators for the US military. Six years ago he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said, that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 137
M	HUMANZ BROTHER (cont'd)	They tested it on soldiers... the first volunteer was Corporal Travis Scotch - a friend of yours, I believe.
M	KABLE	Yeah. He was.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	The second was you.
M	KABLE	The idea was to replace your brain, bit by bit, cell by cell, gradual... the new tissue would never break down, never deteriorate. A new era in human longevity is what they told us. We were doing the world a favor.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down... but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year... in a game. Castle called it society.
M	KABLE	Thank you for the history lesson.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit, baby: what you saw, what you know.
M	KABLE	I don't know what to tell you. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 137
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	You ain't gotta tell me shit, Tillman. I want you to show me.
M	TRACE (O.C.)	Alright. We're ready to rock. Let's transmit in three... two... one...
M	GORGE	Hooz there? What are you doing here? Who are you? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 139
M	GEEK LEADER	Tech support.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	What are we looking at?
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	His memories... translated as raw audiovisual data.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	I read something about this. But that tech is supposed to be a decade away...
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around.
M	HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)	They'll have better shit than this in Best Buy within 18 months. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 141
M	SCOTCH	Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille.
M	KABLE	Scotch.
M	SCOTCH	Scotch. I'll tell you what man: this place sucks.
M	SCOTCH	They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day... nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt - male nurses, I might add...
M	SCOTCH	What about you? You're dressed like a semi-human being... they let you out already? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 144
M	KABLE	I'm not getting out.
M	SCOTCH	OK. Tillman... dude. Are you good?
M	KABLE	I'm fine.
M	SCOTCH	Uh huh. You don't look good.
M	KABLE	I'm sorry.
M	SCOTCH	Well, it's not like you ever looked that good...
M	SCOTCH (cont'd)	Tillman, what did they do to you?
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	What's happening? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 146
M	SCOTCH	Tillman...
M	KABLE	I can't stop it... can't...
M	SCOTCH	Who are you?
M	KABLE	I'm sorry...
M	HUMANZ DUDE	Not the best commercial for K-soft technology. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 149
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	You can say that again.
F	TRACE	He made him do it. Castle made him do it.
M	HUMANZ BROTHER	A test.
M	KABLE	It's you.
F	ANGIE	I missed you... so much...
M	KABLE	Delia. Baby... what did they do? *
M	ANGIE *	I couldn't stop them. * WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 150
M	TRACE (O.C.)	Nobody could. * Your daughter was taken into foster care by the state two years ago. The foster parent paid good money to remain anonymous... to make sure the girl would be untraceable. But there's always a data trail, if you know where to look. We do.
M	KABLE	Where is she?
F	TRACE	I'm sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an insurance policy. She's with Castle.
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Tillman!
M	GINA PARKER SMITH (cont'd)	Wait. I want to come with you.
M	KABLE	That's all the story you're going to get. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	AGENT KEITH (O.C.)	Alright, Silverton. Get up and get out.
M	SIMON	Cool.
M	AGENT KEITH	Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 153
M	FEMALE VOICE	No link... no link. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 156
M	KABLE	Delia... DELIA!
M	KEN CASTLE (O.S.)	Not bad for video, eh? The latest and greatest... defy you to tell it from real life. You imagine porn on this thing? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 157
M	I've got you deep in the heart of me	So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me I've got you under my skin...
M	I'd sacrifice anything come what might	For the sake of having you near In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
M	KEN CASTLE	You're awesome.
M	KABLE	Castle.
M	KEN CASTLE	Kable.
M	KABLE KEN CASTLE	I don't care about you. You don't care about me.
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	... you just want your little sugar pie, I know. So don't do anything stupido. My house, my rules.
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	Come on, I want to show you something.
M	KEN CASTLE	I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is... Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else... but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 that was a genuine nuisance, no doubt about it... One thing even they didn't know, though: I'm wired too. I replaced 98% of my own noodle with nano-tissue years ago... bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank
M	KEN CASTLE	But mine's different. Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it.
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters...
M	KABLE	Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 159
M	KEN CASTLE	You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me. See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates... Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser. A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do. For instance. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 159
M	KABLE	You should've let him fight for himself, Castle - he might've had a shot.
M	KEN CASTLE	I think you're missing the point, my man.
M	KABLE	No, I get it - you're pulling the strings on all of this... ... which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.
M	KEN CASTLE	Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives...
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	You're mine, boy. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 160
M	KEN CASTLE	Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
M	SIMON	Ummm.
M	KEN CASTLE	Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he? Oww!
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	Lucky shot. OK, not really. I need an audience, boys. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 161
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	That's right, you crawl on your belly like a toad... Is this bad? I'm really bad. That's sweet.
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	Alright boys, you ready? A true test.
M	KABLE	No.
M	KEN CASTLE	Just like last time. Remember? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: (2) 161 You're stronger now... a little more fight in you... but I think the end result will be about the same... * Shh.
M	KEN CASTLE (cont'd)	What the hell was that?
M	PONYTAIL GEEK	There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address.
M	GEEK LEADER	Someone on the outside is sending him commands... WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
M	KEN CASTLE	JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN RETARDS!
M	GEEK	Working on it...
M	KEN CASTLE	I think it. You... fucking... do it...
M	KABLE	Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real.
M	GEEK LEADER	Oops. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 163
M	SIMON	YES!!!
M	KABLE	Damn it, kid...
M	KABLE (cont'd)	... is the fuckin pose really necessary?
M	SIMON	Sorry.
F	DELIA	Are you my Daddy Tillman?
M	KABLE	Wait. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 165 Shut it off.
M	GEEK	Pardon?
M	KABLE	The nanex. Set us free. It's nothing to you. A mouse- click.
M	GEEK LEADER	True dat. Well played, Kable.
F	DELIA	Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken?
F	TRACE	This is for you, you dumb bitch. I hope you do the right thing with it. WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 CONTINUED: 166
M	GINA PARKER SMITH	Oh, baby...
M	KABLE	You good, sweetheart?
