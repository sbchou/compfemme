M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Good morning.
M	DANNY	Good morning.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Please state your name for the record.
M	DANNY	Daniel Ocean.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this?
M	DANNY	As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.
M	BOARD MEMBER #2	Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?
M	DANNY	My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a self-destructive pattern.
M	BOARD MEMBER #3	If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?
M	DANNY	She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks.
M	BOARD MEMBER #1	Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released?
M	DANNY	I don't know. How much do you guys make a year?
M	GUARD #2	Ocean, Daniel.
M	GUARD #2	Sign. This came today for you. Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer.
M	GUARD #1	Those your lawyers?
M	DANNY	My wife's.
M	GUARD #1	What's it say?
M	DANNY	I'm a free man. Jersey): Life is hard out there.
M	DANNY	Hello, Frank.
M	FRANK	I beg your pardon, sir. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ramon. See?
M	DANNY	My mistake... Table's cold anyway.
M	FRANK	You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir. It gets busy around one.
M	DANNY	Thanks. Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...
M	FRANK (O.S.)	Catching up on current events?
M	DANNY	Ramon?
M	FRANK	Glad to meet you. Frank Catton wouldn't get by the gaming board. You just out?
M	DANNY	This afternoon.
M	FRANK	And already turning over a new leaf.
M	DANNY	You seen him?
M	FRANK	Last I heard he was in L.A. Teaching movie stars how to play cards. Why? You don't have something planned already?
M	DANNY	You kidding? I just became a citizen again.
M	FRANK	Jesus...
M	FRANK	It's tough now, our line of work. Everybody so serious. Too many guns, too many computers. Whadda you gonna do? Steal from ordinary people?
M	DANNY	That would be criminal.
M	FRANK	So what's left? Banks? Hah. Banks got no money. It's all electronic. Only place that still takes cash is...
M	DANNY	Casinos.
M	FRANK	Oh, no...
M	DANNY	Oh, yes...
M	FRANK	When?
M	DANNY	Soon. Interested?
M	DANNY	Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny Ocean. I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours. No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir. No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state.
M	TOPHER (O.S.)	Hey! Hey, Rusty!
M	TOPHER	Hey, I don't know if you're, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know, incorporated, but you should think about it, really, 'cause I was talking to my manager yesterday --
M	RUSTY	Bernie?
M	TOPHER	No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie, my business manager, he's also Bernie, he was telling me that since this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense. So he suggested that it'd be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby --
M	TOPHER	Or, or we could keep it cash.
M	RUSTY	Alright. Who's here?
M	TOPHER	Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn't make it. He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.
M	RUSTY	That's a problem.
M	TOPHER	Barry is here.
M	RUSTY	I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
M	TOPHER	Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and he brought his girlfriend.
M	RUSTY	Not the one from --
M	TOPHER	Uh-huh.
M	RUSTY	I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident.
M	RUSTY	Good evening, guys. Let's play some cards...
M	RUSTY	... and let's play some cards.
M	TOPHER	A hundred bucks to me... Ah, what the hell. Pocket change. Call.
M	RUSTY	Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand?
M	RUSTY	Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn't change them. Leave 'em where they are and make your bet.
M	RUSTY	You're showing. Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't... Thank you.
M	RUSTY	Josh. Deal to your left.
F	WAITRESS	One McCallum neat. And four bottled waters.
M	SETH	Two pair -- nines and twos.
M	RUSTY	You got me. Let's take a little break.
M	BARTENDER	How's the game going?!!
M	RUSTY	It's been the longest hour of my life.
M	BARTENDER	What?!
M	RUSTY	I'm running away with your wife.
M	BARTENDER	Cool, man!
M	TOPHER	Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that's alright.
M	RUSTY	What's this?
M	DANNY	The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I'm not intruding.
M	TOPHER	No intrusion at all --
M	RUSTY	What was his name, the bouncer's?
M	DANNY	I don't remember.
M	RUSTY	A card player with amnesia. This should be fun.
M	TOPHER	What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? If you don't mind my asking.
M	DANNY	Why should I mind? Two cards, please... I just got out of prison.
M	TOPHER	Really? Really...
M	RUSTY	Barry, you're showing again. Sorry.
M	JOSH	What'd you, uh, go to prison for?
M	DANNY	I stole things.
M	JOSH	What, like jewels? Diamonds?
M	RUSTY	Incan matrimonial headmasks.
M	JOSH	From a museum?
M	DANNY	Gallery.
M	SETH	There a lot of money in those? Incan matrimonial...
M	DANNY	Headmasks. Some.
M	RUSTY	Don't let him fool you, Seth. There's boatloads. If you can move the things... One card to me. ... but you can't.
M	DANNY	My fence seemed confident enough.
M	RUSTY	If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.
M	DANNY	Some people just lack vision.
M	RUSTY	Probably everybody in cell block E.
M	DANNY	Well, that's all behind us now.
M	RUSTY	I should hope so.
M	DANNY	I raise you five hundred dollars.
M	RUSTY	Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker?
M	BARRY TOPHER	Um, never bet on, uh, on 'Leave emotion at the
M	RUSTY	That's right. My friend here just raised me out of pique. Today's lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.
M	SETH	Okay. Uh, your five hundred and... another two?
M	RUSTY	Tophe...
M	TOPHER	Seven to me. Plus three. What the hell.
M	RUSTY	Indeed. But be careful you don't push him too high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.
M	JOSH	What's that to me? A thousand?
M	RUSTY	All you have to do is call.
M	DANNY	What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?
M	DANNY	Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better. Five hundred to call. And two grand more.
M	RUSTY	Guys, you're free to do what you like. It's a lot of money. But I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.
M	RUSTY	We call.
M	RUSTY	Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing.
M	DANNY	Thanks for the game, fellas. Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It's for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows.
M	RUSTY	That was, that was just...
M	DANNY	Unprofessional.
M	RUSTY	How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you?
M	DANNY	Why do you think I came to see you first?
M	DANNY	Ten grand. Half of it's yours.
M	RUSTY	You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for me.
M	DANNY	I've got something better for you.
M	RUSTY	How's Tess?
M	RUSTY	Alright. Tell me.
M	DANNY	It's tricky. No one's ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew.
M	RUSTY	Guns?
M	DANNY	Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take...
M	RUSTY	What's the target?
M	DANNY	Eight figures each.
M	RUSTY	What's. The. Target.
M	DANNY	When's the last time you were in Vegas?
M	RUSTY	What? You wanna knock over a casino?
M	DANNY	The vault at the Bellagio.
M	RUSTY	If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops. Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.
M	DANNY	Yep.
M	RUSTY	You said three casinos...
M	DANNY	These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. But every dime ends up here.
M	RUSTY	The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These are Terry Benedict's places.
M	DANNY	Yes, they are. Think he'll mind?
M	RUSTY	More than somewhat.
M	RUSTY	You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.
M	DANNY	Like what, you think?
M	RUSTY	Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?
M	DANNY	As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.
M	RUSTY	But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose... Aha.
M	DANNY	Aha.
M	RUSTY	Reuben.
M	DANNY	So...
M	RUSTY	So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me again.
M	DANNY	Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
M	RUSTY	I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.
M	DANNY	Really? I thought it was much harder than that --
M	DANNY	Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
M	SECURITY GUARD	Sorry. You two done up here? Find what you wanted?
M	DANNY	Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? Make some copies.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Whatever you need.
M	DANNY	'Preciate it.
M	RUSTY	I need a reason. And don't say money. Why do this?
M	DANNY	Why not do it?
M	DANNY	Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.
M	RUSTY	You're been practicing that speech, haven't you?
M	DANNY	A little. Did I rush it? It felt like I rushed it.
M	RUSTY	No, it was good.
M	RUSTY	I wonder what Reuben will say?
M	TISHKOFF (V.O.)	You're out of your goddamn minds.
M	TISHKOFF	Are you listening to me? You are, both of you, nuts. I know more about casino security than any man alive. I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. Okay, bad example...
M	DANNY	It's never been tried.
M	TISHKOFF	Oh, it's been tried. A few guys even came close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas history? Number three. The bronze medal. Pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the Sands. He got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him.
M	TISHKOFF (V.O.)	Second most successful robbery. The Flamingo '71. This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him.
M	TISHKOFF (V.O.)	Course, he was breathing out of a hose the next three weeks, goddamn hippie.
M	TISHKOFF	And the closest any man has gotten to robbing a Las Vegas casino...
M	TISHKOFF	Outside of Caesar's in '87. He came, he grabbed, he got conquered.
M	TISHKOFF	But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert!
M	RUSTY	You're right. He's right.
M	DANNY	Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
M	RUSTY	That's exactly it. Pure ego.
M	TISHKOFF	Yeah yeah blah blah.
M	DANNY	Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you.
M	TISHKOFF	Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it.
M	DANNY	It was our pleasure.
M	RUSTY	I'd never been to Belize.
M	TISHKOFF	Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you.
M	TISHKOFF	Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob?
M	DANNY	The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand.
M	TISHKOFF	Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.
M	RUSTY	Say, you know, he's right.
M	TISHKOFF	You guys... Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?
M	DANNY	What do you have against him? That's the real question.
M	TISHKOFF	He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I don't see what you're doin'.
M	RUSTY	What are we doing, Reuben?
M	TISHKOFF	You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. Done. But Benedict... At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.
M	DANNY	That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.
M	TISHKOFF	Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you have in mind? Alright. Who's in?
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Frank C. is in.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	What about drivers? I talked to the Malloys yesterday.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	The Mormon twins?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Electronics?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Livingston Dell. Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad. How are his nerves? Okay. Not so bad you'd notice.
M	LIVINGSTON	D-don't, don't-don't... touch... it.
M	FBI MAN #1	What?
M	LIVINGSTON	Do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it?
M	FBI MAN #2	Hey, Radio Shack: relax.
M	RUSTY	Munitions.
M	DANNY	Phil Turentine.
M	RUSTY	Dead.
M	DANNY	No shit? On the job?
M	RUSTY	Sun cancer.
M	DANNY	You send flowers?
M	RUSTY	Dated his wife a while.
M	DANNY	Basher...
M	RUSTY	We may be too late.
M	BASHER	Sweet...
M	BASHER	You know, you guys had one job to do.
M	COP	And that's all you used during the event? Nothing else?
M	BASHER	Are you accusing me of booby- trapping?
M	COP	Well, how 'bout it?
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
M	RUSTY	Isn't that right, Basher?
M	BASHER	That's right.
M	RUSTY	Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess. A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. That's our man. Tell me something else. Have you checked him for booby traps on his person? I mean really checked, not just for weapons...
M	RUSTY	Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him?
M	COP	Who?
M	RUSTY	Just go find him, will you? How fast can you put something together with what I passed you?
M	BASHER	Done. Thirty seconds all right?
M	RUSTY	From when?
M	BASHER	Now.
M	RUSTY	Ten seconds?
M	BASHER	Not quite. Is Danny here?
M	RUSTY	Around the corner.
M	BASHER	Be good working with professionals again. Okay: go.
M	RUSTY	Everyone down! Get down! There's a bomb in the... swing through the air.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing Yen.
M	DANNY	So he can walk on a rope.
M	RUSTY	More than that.
M	DANNY	So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list?
M	RUSTY	He is the list.
M	DANNY	Who else?
M	RUSTY	Watch.
M	RUSTY	There's your grease man.
M	DANNY	We need Saul.
M	RUSTY	He won't come. He swore off the game a year ago.
M	DANNY	He get religion?
M	RUSTY	Ulcers.
M	DANNY	You can ask him.
M	RUSTY	I can ask.
M	SAUL	I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning.
M	RUSTY	How ya been, Saul?
M	SAUL	Never better.
M	RUSTY	What's with the orange?
M	SAUL	My doctor says I need vitamins.
M	RUSTY	So why don't you take vitamins?
M	SAUL	You come here to give me a physical?
M	RUSTY	I got a box seat. Come on.
M	RUSTY	I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul.
M	SAUL	A man shouldn't drink on the job.
M	RUSTY	Who we rooting for here?
M	SAUL	Number four.
M	SAUL	You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with?
M	RUSTY	Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want?
M	SAUL	Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. I've changed.
M	RUSTY	Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change.
M	SAUL	Quit connin' me.
M	RUSTY	That your hound way in the back there?
M	SAUL	He breaks late. Everyone knows this.
M	SAUL	You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is?
M	DANNY (V.O.)	And Saul makes ten.
M	DANNY	Ten should do it, don't you think? You think we need one more? You think we need one more. Okay. We'll get one more.
M	LINUS	Sorry 'bout that.
M	STOCKBROKER	No problem, guy.
M	DANNY	Hi, Linus. Sit down.
M	LINUS	Who are you?
M	DANNY	A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. Sit down.
M	DANNY	Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
M	LINUS	That wasn't work, that was practice.
M	DANNY	You're either in or out, right now.
M	LINUS	What is it?
M	DANNY	A plane ticket. A job offer.
M	LINUS	You're pretty trusting pretty fast.
M	DANNY	Bobby has every faith in you.
M	LINUS	Fathers are like that. He didn't tell you? He doesn't like me trading on his name.
M	DANNY	You do this job, he'll be trading on yours.
M	LINUS	What if I say no?
M	DANNY	We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
M	DANNY	That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.
M	LINUS	Las Vegas, huh?
M	DANNY	America's playground. promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call
M	LIVINGSTON	Trick or treat.
M	TISHKOFF	What, you guys get a group rate or something?
M	TURK	You make it out to Utah much, Saul?
M	SAUL	Not as much as I'd like.
M	TURK	You should. You'd like it. You'd like Provo.
M	VIRGIL	Anybody see the salsa goes with this? Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas.
M	DANNY	Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.
M	DANNY	Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.
M	BASHER	What the hell.
M	LINUS	Hi.
M	TISHKOFF	You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh?
M	LINUS	Yeah.
M	TISHKOFF	From Chicago?
M	LINUS	Yeah.
M	TISHKOFF	It's nice there. You like it?
M	LINUS	Yeah.
M	TISHKOFF	That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn room.
M	DANNY	Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...
M	DANNY	Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we're going to rob it.
M	LINUS	Smash-and-grab job, huh?
M	RUSTY	It's a little more complicated than that.
M	DANNY	Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.
M	DANNY	Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First: we have to get within the casino cages --
M	RUSTY	-- here, here, and here --
M	DANNY	-- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications --
M	RUSTY	-- which we can't fake --
M	DANNY	-- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
M	RUSTY	-- which we won't get.
M	DANNY	Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --
M	RUSTY	-- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.
M	DANNY	Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?
M	RUSTY	No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. Anyone else?
M	TURK	You said something about good news...
M	DANNY	The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. Now there are eleven of us. Each with an equal share. You do the math.
M	RUSTY	That's what I said.
M	SAUL	I have a question. Say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can't open...
M	RUSTY	Without being seen by the cameras.
M	DANNY	Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention that.
M	SAUL	Say we do all that. We're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped? now.
M	DANNY	Yeah.
M	DANNY	Alright. Here's how we'll begin. First task: reconnaissance. I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. From the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart...
M	DANNY (V.O.)	I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee...
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you guys to know the quick routes out.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Second task: power. On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it's your show.
M	LIVINGSTON	Well, it's not the least accessible system I've seen, but it's close. I don't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into?
M	LIVINGSTON	Then this is definitely a black bag job. Do they employ an in- house technician?
M	RUSTY	Two. And one of them is lonely.
F	DANCER	I'll be right back, honey. Don't move a muscle.
M	TECHNICIAN	Depends on the muscle.
M	RUSTY	Thanks, Charmaine. I'll have it back within the hour. Say hello to your mom for me.
F	DANCER	Say it yourself. She'll be onstage in five minutes.
M	TOURIST	Hey, watch it, bud...
M	SLIM	433, we have visual impairment on the east door camera. Malloy)...
M	SENTRY	Excuse me, sir: You're going to have to move your balloons.
M	VIRGIL	Who you calling 'bud,' pal?
M	TURK (TOURIST)	Who you calling 'pal,' friend?
M	VIRGIL	Who you calling 'friend'... ... bud...
M	VIRGIL	You hear about this new medical discovery they made? It's called a 'sense of direction.' Apparently we're all supposed to have one...
M	TURK	Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon boy.
M	SENTRY	Gentlemen, gentlemen...
M	DANNY	Why do they paint hallways that color?
M	RUSTY	They say taupe is very soothing.
M	DANNY	Uh-oh.
M	FAT	Hiya.
M	LIVINGSTON	Fine, thanks.
M	FAT	Hey...
M	VIRGIL	Hey... get your own balloons.
M	FAT	Hey...
M	FAT	You dropped this.
M	LIVINGSTON	Thanks.
M	DANNY	Well...
M	RUSTY	Yeah...
M	DANNY	Fourth task: construction...
M	DANNY (V.O.)	We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	For practice.
M	DANNY (V.O.)	Something like that.
M	DANNY	Fifth task: intelligence. We need those codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three.
M	LINUS	Benedict.
M	DANNY	Learn to love his shadow. Sixth task: transport...
M	LINUS	Wait, wait, wait. All I get to do is watch him?
M	DANNY	For now. You gotta walk before you crawl.
M	RUSTY	Reverse that.
M	DANNY	Sixth task: transport...
M	BILLY TIM	I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is the best offer I can make you.
M	FRANK	Oh, I understand perfectly. They are beautiful vans. Well, I thank you for your time, Mister...?
M	BILLY TIM	Denham. Billy Tim Denham.
M	FRANK	Yes, Denham, like a jean. You know: you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize?
M	BILLY TIM	I'm sorry?
M	FRANK	I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in...
M	BILLY TIM	Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing to pay in cash?
M	FRANK	I did. You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies...
M	BILLY TIM	If you could pay cash, I could probably drop the price a little. To, say, seventeen... ... sixteen each.
M	FRANK	That would be lovely.
M	DANNY	... Power, surveillance, transport...
M	TISHKOFF	Anything I can do?
M	DANNY	Get your wallet.
M	SAUL	This is nice material.
M	DANNY	It's Armani, Saul.
M	SAUL	It's very nice.
M	DANNY	Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?
M	SAUL	If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning.
M	DANNY	You're ready.
M	SAUL	Hello. My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga...
M	SAUL	My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga...
M	DANNY	There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last.
M	SAUL	You seen my...
M	DANNY	Bought you a fresh roll.
M	VIRGIL	Mr. Zerga, we're here.
M	DANNY	Good luck, Lyman.
M	SAUL	Luck is for losers.
M	V.I.P. CONCIERGE	Good afternoon, sir. How can I be of service?
M	SAUL	My name is Lyman Zerga. I'd like a suite, please.
M	V.I.P. CONCIERGE	Do you have a reservation with us?
M	SAUL	I don't make reservations.
M	RUSTY	Okay. Tell me about Benedict.
M	LINUS	The guy is a machine.
M	LINUS (V.O.)	He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet's name on the way in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.
M	LINUS (V.O.)	Offices are upstairs. He works hard, hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose.
M	LINUS (V.O.)	Spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager. What do they talk about?
M	LINUS (V.O.)	All business. Benedict likes to know what's going on in his casinos. There's rarely an incident he doesn't know about or handle personally.
M	LINUS (V.O.)	He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers. He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents: the day's take and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant.
M	LINUS	Give him another ten seconds.
M	LINUS	As I said: a machine.
M	RUSTY	And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?
M	LINUS	Two minutes after they've been changed, he's got 'em in hand. I'll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target. He is as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy's home and bankrupted --
M	RUSTY	-- his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard.
M	LINUS	He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood.
M	RUSTY	You scared?
M	LINUS	You suicidal?
M	RUSTY	Only in the morning. Now what?
M	LINUS	Now comes the girl... if she comes in after he does, that means they're in a snit.
M	RUSTY	Where's she come from?
M	LINUS	The museum downstairs. She's the curator there. Wait... here she is. You'll like this.
M	LINUS	I don't know if we can use her yet. I haven't even caught her name.
M	RUSTY	Tess.
M	LINUS	What?
M	RUSTY	certain and very Her name is Tess.
M	TISHKOFF	This looks familiar. Where'd you get this?
M	VIRGIL	Off your Rolls.
M	TISHKOFF	Danny! Tell 'em not to touch the Rolls!
M	DANNY	29:47. Everything okay in there?
M	RUSTY	But what doesn't beat the shit out of being a circus performer?
M	DANNY	What is it?
M	RUSTY	Tell me this isn't about her. Or I'll walk off the job right now. Tess. She's with Terry Benedict now. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife.
M	DANNY	Ex-wife.
M	RUSTY	Tell me.
M	DANNY	It's not. About that. Entirely.
M	DANNY	You said you needed a reason. Well, this is mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren't gonna hurt anybody. We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.
M	RUSTY	Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now. And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways.
M	DANNY	If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice.
M	DANNY	How'd she look by the way? Tess...
M	RUSTY	I've seen her happier.
M	TESS (V.O.)	'Radiant' is the word. Absolutely radiant.
F	TESS	He painted it in the summer of 1912, after the break-up with Fernande Olivier.
M	SELLER	She must have put him through hell.
F	TESS	You can see the conflict. He makes her both erotic and grotesque. He's hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives him crazy.
M	AIDE-DE-CAMP	Mr. Santaniello has an early flight. Do you think Mr. Benedict will be late?
F	TESS	Mr. Benedict is never late.
M	BENEDICT	Am I late?
F	TESS	Not at all, Mr. Benedict. Allow me to introduce to you Mr. Jean Santaniello.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I kept you. I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.
M	SELLER	I understand it's going to be a hell of a fight.
M	BENEDICT	We hope.
F	TESS	Here it is.
M	BENEDICT	Magnificent! I've been following her for fifteen years now. At last I've made her a home. All the arrangements and so forth...
M	SELLER	Done. She's yours.
M	BENEDICT	Not mine. She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel. Isn't that right, Ms. Ocean?
F	TESS	Yes, Mr. Benedict.
M	BENEDICT	She's lovely, isn't she? I can't be the only one who was after her.
M	SELLER	You're the only one who met my price.
M	BENEDICT	Ah, but this... You can't put a price on beauty. But I shouldn't philosophize. I own casinos, after all.
M	AIDE-DE-CAMP	Can we get a quick shot? Mr. Santaniello has a plane to catch.
M	BENEDICT	Of course, of course.
F	TESS	You like it?
M	BENEDICT	I like that you like it. I have some bad news from the world of high fashion. It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night. Red trunks with a white stripe.
F	TESS	Oh?
M	BENEDICT	And you, as I recall, will be wearing a red Donna Karan? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress...
F	TESS	I see.
M	BENEDICT	He's a charming man, but no one's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you. I've asked Paolo to find three or four things for you to try. I hope you're not too disappointed.
M	BENEDICT	Are you sure?
M	BENEDICT	I'll see you tonight.
F	TESS	What? We're alone.
M	BENEDICT	In my hotels, there's always someone watching.
F	TESS	I'll see you tonight.
M	BENEDICT	Actually, I do like it.
M	OMITTED 103	thru
M	HIGH ROLLER #1	Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?
M	SAUL	I don't believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don't believe in questions, either.
M	BENEDICT	Eddie. Anything for me?
M	PIT BOSS	Mr. Zerga, sir. Lyman Zerga. In the third position. Wishes to speak with you privately.
M	BENEDICT	Who is he?
M	PIT BOSS	Businessman of some kind, working mostly in Europe. He's very vague, but I asked around. Word is he deals primarily in arms. One of the biggest.
M	BENEDICT	Zerga? Never heard of him.
M	PIT BOSS	Yessir. That's why I don't doubt it.
M	BENEDICT	He's staying here?
M	PIT BOSS	Checked in two nights ago, sir. He's in the Mirador suite.
M	BENEDICT	How's he doing?
M	PIT BOSS	Up. Almost forty grand.
M	BENEDICT	Good for him...
F	TESS	You're thirty seconds late. I was about to send out a search party... Danny...
M	DANNY	Hello, Tess.
F	TESS	What are you doing here?
M	DANNY	I'm out.
F	TESS	You're out.
M	DANNY	Of prison. You remember. The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed.
F	TESS	I don't smoke. Don't sit --
M	DANNY	They said I'd paid my debt to society.
F	TESS	Funny, I never got a check.
M	TESS DANNY	You can't stay. It's good to see you.
M	DANNY	You're not wearing your ring.
F	TESS	I sold it. And I don't have a husband. Or didn't you get the papers?
M	DANNY	My last day inside.
F	TESS	I told you I'd write.
F	TESS	Danny. Go. Now. Before...
M	DANNY	Benedict?
M	DANNY	Whiskey and -- -- whiskey.
F	TESS	Danny...
M	DANNY	You're doing a great job curating the museum.
M	DANNY	The Vermeer is quite good. Simple but vibrant. Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.
F	TESS	Remind you of anyone?
M	DANNY	And I still get Monet and Manet confused. Which one married his mistress?
F	TESS	Monet.
M	DANNY	Right. Manet had syphilis.
F	TESS	They also painted occasionally.
M	DANNY	You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.
F	TESS	Did it always go this poorly?
M	DANNY	Yes.
F	TESS	Sounds frustrating.
M	DANNY	You were never easy. Okay. I'll make this quick. I came here for you. I'm gonna get on with my life, and I want you with me.
F	TESS	You're a thief and a liar.
M	DANNY	I only lied about being a thief. But I don't do that anymore.
F	TESS	Steal?
M	DANNY	Lie.
F	TESS	I'm with someone now who doesn't have to make that kind of distinction.
M	DANNY	No, he's very clear on both.
F	TESS	Nice. Work on that for two years, too?
M	DANNY	Year and a half.
F	TESS	Do you know what your problem is?
M	DANNY	I only have one?
F	TESS	You've met too many people like you. I'm with Terry now.
M	DANNY	Does he make you laugh?
F	TESS	He doesn't make me cry.
M	HIGH ROLLER	You don't want to get in the hole too heavy to this Benedict. A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g's from the guy. Two months went by, Benedict hadn't heard from him, he calls my friend up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll get to it when I get to it,' my friend says. Half hour later Benedict's in my friend's hotel room, dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet. 'You gonna get to it now?'
M	FRANK	Bank wins -- natural nine.
M	HIGH ROLLER	Hiya, Terry.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Weintraub. How's everything?
M	HIGH ROLLER	Eh. They put too much grenadine in my Shirley Temple.
M	BENEDICT	And here I thought you were drinking vodka. Mr. Zerga.
M	SAUL	Mr. Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.
M	BENEDICT	You're the guest, sir.
M	SAUL	And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can you sit in for a hand?
M	BENEDICT	I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers.
M	SAUL	That's a shame. You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley.
M	BENEDICT	No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth.
M	SAUL	The fight is Saturday, is it not?
M	BENEDICT	Yes. I can get you seats...
M	SAUL	No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.
M	BENEDICT	I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you.
M	SAUL	The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid I need something more secure.
M	BENEDICT	I can assure you, the house safe is utterly...
M	SAUL	I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now: what can you offer me besides the safe?
F	TESS	See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to get away from what happened. How do I get my five years back, Danny?
M	DANNY	You can't. But what you can do is not throw away another five years.
F	TESS	You don't know anything about --
M	DANNY	Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I'll have to live with that. But not him.
F	TESS	Spoken like a true ex-husband.
M	DANNY	I'm not joking, Tess.
F	TESS	I'm not laughing. You have to admit there's a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life.
M	DANNY	Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
F	TESS	Do you remember what I said to you when we first met?
M	DANNY	You said: you better know what you're doing.
F	TESS	Do you? Now? Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don't.
M	DANNY	I know what I'm doing.
M	BENEDICT	What are you doing?
M	DANNY	Catching up.
F	TESS	Terry, meet my ex-husband...
M	DANNY	Danny Ocean.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Ocean. Forgive me for being late. A guest required my attention.
F	TESS	Danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me.
M	BENEDICT	Is that right?
M	DANNY	I was shocked myself. Imagine the odds.
M	BENEDICT	'Of all the gin joints in all the world...' You've been in prison until recently, isn't that right? How does it feel to be out?
M	DANNY	About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side.
M	BENEDICT	There's the human condition for you.
F	TESS	Terry, Danny was just about to...
M	DANNY	I just wanted to say hello. For old time's sake.
M	BENEDICT	Stay for a drink, if you like.
F	TESS	He can't --
M	DANNY	-- I can't.
M	BENEDICT	Well, then I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.
M	DANNY	You never know.
M	BENEDICT	I know everything that happens in my hotels.
M	DANNY	So I should put those towels back.
M	BENEDICT	The towels you can keep.
M	DANNY	Good seeing you, Tess.
F	TESS	Take care, Danny.
F	TESS	I'm sorry --
M	BENEDICT	Don't be.
M	MAID (O.S.)	House cleaning.
M	BASHER	Just jumping into the shower, can you come back later?
M	REPORTER (V.O.)	We're here at the historic Paradiso Hotel and Casino, once the prize resort of Las Vegas, now seconds away from demolition...
M	REPORTER	... and here's Reuben Tishkoff, former owner of the Paradiso, come to bid farewell to his fabled resort and wish Terry Benedict all the best with his future plans for the property...
M	BENEDICT	Good to see you.
M	REUBEN	Go shit in your mouth.
M	BENEDICT	I hope there's as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday's fight.
M	REUBEN	G'bye, honey...
M	BASHER	Shit. Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like with it.
M	RUSTY	Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All goes well there and we're a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes. That's when we make our move...
M	RUSTY	Okay: they've put you in the middle of the room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. What do you do?
M	FRANK	Fin says he shorts it.
M	LIVINGSTON	Make it a sawbuck.
M	BASHER	We're in deep shit.
M	BASHER	The damn demo crew didn't use a coaxial lynch to back the mainline! Onioned the mainframe couplet!
M	REUBEN	You understand any of this?
M	LIVINGSTON	I'll explain later.
M	BASHER	Blew the backup grid one by one! Like dominoes!
M	DANNY	Basher. What happened? They did exactly what I planned to do. Only they did it by accident. Now they know their weakness. And they're fixing it.
M	DANNY	So...
M	BASHER	So unless we decide to do this job in Reno, we're screwed.
M	RUSTY	We could --
M	DANNY	By tomorrow?
M	BASHER	We could use a pinch.
M	DANNY	What -- is a pinch?
M	BASHER (V.O.)	A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.
M	RUSTY	For how long?
M	BASHER	About ten seconds.
M	DANNY	Could a pinch take out the power of an entire city? Like, I don't...
M	BASHER	Las Vegas? But there's only one pinch in the world big enough to handle it.
M	DANNY	Where?
M	BASHER	Pasadena.
M	DANNY	You two ready?
M	DANNY	What are you doing?
M	LINUS	Coming with you.
M	LINUS	But...
M	VIRGIL	Are you a man?
M	TURK	Yes. Nineteen.
M	VIRGIL	Are you alive?
M	TURK	Yes. Eighteen.
M	VIRGIL	Evel Knievel.
M	TURK	Shit! Okay, your turn...
M	VIRGIL	Co-sign squared over .0455.
M	TURK	No. Co-sign squared over .0415.
M	VIRGIL	.04-five-five.
M	TURK	One-five.
M	VIRGIL	You're so wrong.
M	TURK	You don't know your string theory, bitch.
M	VIRGIL	Mom told me she loves me more.
M	TURK	She told me she was going to tell you that. Stop it.
M	VIRGIL (O.S.)	Make me. Stop it.
M	VIRGIL (O.S.)	Make me.
M	DANNY	We got it. Let's go.
M	DANNY	Wait a minute.
M	DANNY	Where's Linus?
M	DANNY	There he is.
M	VIRGIL (O.S.)	One of us should help him.
M	BASHER	Then there'll be two of us who need saving.
M	DANNY	He knows where we are.
M	TURK (O.S.)	Where'd he go?
M	TURK	What? Would you -- shouldn't someone be behind the wheel?
M	OMITTED 127	
M	DANNY	Alright, back it up, back it up!
M	DANNY	C'mon, c'mon...
M	YEN	Ahhh!
M	DANNY	I say stay in the van, you stay in the van, got it? 'Cause you lose focus for one second in this game, and someone gets hurt.
M	LINUS	I got it. It's fight night in Las Vegas...
M	JIM LAMPLEY (V.O.)	... people are flooding in from all over the country to see what has been dubbed the 'Fight to End All Fights'...
M	JIM LAMPLEY	... and even though it's still five hours 'til the opening bell, the energy here is fever-pitched.
M	MANAGER	How we doing?
M	WATCHER (V.O.)	Cotton couldn't be taller.
M	TISHKOFF	Where are they? That's what I want to know. Where are they?
M	SAUL	They'll be here.
M	TISHKOFF	'They'll be here.' Thanks a lot, Fidel.
M	LIVINGSTON	Yikes.
M	RUSTY	You boys have a nice trip?
M	LIVINGSTON	We have a problem.
M	LIVINGSTON	You've been red-flagged. It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you. Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.
M	DANNY	This is a problem.
M	RUSTY	Saul: time to get out. It's time when I say it is.
M	RUSTY	Now! I'm out.
M	RUSTY	You have any idea how this happened?
M	LINUS	I do. He's been chasing Benedict's woman. Got into a real snarl with him two nights ago. I was tailing you.
M	DANNY	Who told you to do that?
M	RUSTY	I did. I knew you couldn't leave Tess alone.
M	TISHKOFF	Who's Tess?
M	DANNY	My wife.
M	RUSTY	Ex-wife.
M	SAUL	Tess is here?
M	RUSTY	I'm sorry. I didn't know if it would sting you, but it did. You're out, Danny.
M	TISHKOFF	He's out?!
M	RUSTY	It's that or we shut down right now. His involvement puts us all at risk.
M	DANNY	This isn't your call.
M	RUSTY	You made it my call. When you put her ahead of us. You made it mine.
M	DANNY	This is my job.
M	RUSTY	Not anymore.
M	TISHKOFF	But, but... he can't just be out. Who's gonna take his place?
M	RUSTY	Kid, you up for it?
M	RUSTY	Find everyone else. Let 'em know the change in plan. Curtain goes up at seven.
M	SAUL	Tess is with Benedict now? She's too tall for him.
M	BENEDICT	Yes. Yes. No. Very much no. Then inform Mr. Levin he'll find a better view of the fight in front of his television. Surely he must have H.B.O.
M	BENEDICT	What are you thinking about?
F	TESS	You.
M	BENEDICT	Any sign of Ocean?
M	MANAGER (WALSH)	Not in a couple hours. You want him out? I can bounce him from the state for parole violation if you like.
M	BENEDICT	Put a guy on him. He's here for a reason. I'd like to know what it is. But if he comes anywhere near Tess, take it to the next level.
M	MANAGER	Bruiser?
M	SAUL	Mr. Benedict.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Zerga. It's a very busy night for me. Are we on schedule?
M	SAUL	I have no reason to suspect otherwise. My couriers should be here momentarily.
M	BENEDICT	It's a nice evening. Shall we wait outside?
M	TURK (V.O.)	They're in position.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	Okay. We're a go.
M	TURK	Mr. Zerga. A gift from Mr. Hesse.
M	SAUL	Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.
M	FRANK	Lookin' like a bad night for the house.
M	BENEDICT	Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean's in the west slots.
M	BENEDICT	I'm afraid I can't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages. I hope you don't mind...
M	SAUL	Of course not.
M	RACETRACK DENIZEN	Saul? Saul Bloom, is that you?
M	RACETRACK DENIZEN	Saul, it's me. Bucky Buchanan, remember? From Saratoga.
M	SAUL	Friedrich, Gunther.
M	SAUL	Mr. Benedict... Please: I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin.
M	DANNY	Pops, you won.
M	RUSTY	Where you gonna put your hands?
M	RUSTY	No...
M	RUSTY	Not the pockets, either. And don't touch your tie. Look at me...
M	RUSTY	That how you gonna stand?
M	RUSTY	Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look?
M	RUSTY	Death. You look down, they know you're lying --
M	RUSTY	-- and up they know you don't know the truth. Don't use three words when one will do, don't shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don't make him laugh, he's gotta like you then forget you the moment you've left his sight, and for God's sakes whatever you do, don't under any circumstances -- Rust, can you come here a sec?
M	RUSTY	Sure thing.
M	BENEDICT	They're very beautiful. A gift.
M	BENEDICT	Can you lift them out, please?
M	BENEDICT	Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault. While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault...
M	SAUL	Why not?
M	BENEDICT	Insurance, for one. Security, another. And I don't trust you.
M	WALSH (MANAGER)	I put two plainclothes on Ocean. He's at the keno bar now.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino manager. If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor. Those are my terms. Yes or no?
M	SAUL	You leave me no choice.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	Deep breaths. You'll do fine.
M	LINUS	Thanks.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	No sweat, kid. You're a rock. Now don't fuck up.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Room service.
M	TURK	Who ordered the penne? underneath it's the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to
M	RUSTY	You ready?
M	WALSH	we oversee all gaming in the casino as well as our vault. You'll be able to monitor your briefcase from here.
M	SAUL	Don't let me keep you.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Zerga...
M	RUSTY	Linus... you're up.
M	LINUS	Deep breaths, deep breaths.
M	LINUS	Mr. Benedict...
M	BENEDICT	Yes?
M	LINUS	Sheldon Wills. Nevada Gaming Commission. Could I have two minutes of your time?
M	BENEDICT	Of course. Anything for the N.G.C. AT KENO BAR 162
M	RUSTY	Okay: when do you make the deposit?
M	TURK	Not until we get your signal.
M	VIRGIL	Hey. What do we look like: a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something?
M	RUSTY	Amazing: how's it feel? You alright? Want something to read? Magazine?
M	RUSTY	Okay. I'm counting down. Thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now.
M	LIVINGSTON	You get no tip. LINUS It only came to our attention this morning, Mr. Benedict. Apparently he has a record longer than my arm.
M	BENEDICT	If he is who you say he is. Charlie. Call over Ramon Escalante.
M	PIT BOSS	Certainly, Mr. Benedict.
M	RUSTY	Did you make it out?
M	LIVINGSTON	His head blocked the last two numbers. We missed it, Linus. You gotta grab the combination yourself.
M	BENEDICT	You new at the commission?
M	LINUS	Been there about two years.
M	BENEDICT	I know Hal Lindley over there. You work with him at all?
M	LINUS	Not since he died last year.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Escalante. Would you come with us, please?
M	FRANK	What's this about?
M	BENEDICT	I think it's better if we talked off the floor.
M	MAITRE D'	Good evening, Mr. Tishkoff.
M	TISHKOFF	Good evening, Marcel. My nieces and I would like a table. Something quiet before the fight.
M	MAITRE D'	I can put you at 19 in just a couple minutes.
M	TISHKOFF	Quick as you can. The meter's running here.
M	MAITRE D'	Good evening, Miss Ocean. Right this way... Hey...
M	DANNY	Try to keep your tongue in your mouth.
M	TISHKOFF	Yeah, pal, well only if you take your thumb out of your...
M	TISHKOFF	Hey: you have any idea who I think I am?
F	TESS	Danny: No.
M	DANNY	I'll just be a moment.
F	TESS	I'm having you thrown out of here.
F	TESS	You're up to something, Danny. What? And don't say you came here for me. You're pulling a job, aren't you?
M	DANNY	Tess...
F	TESS	Well, know this: no matter what it is, you won't win me back. I can't afford it.
M	DANNY	I just came to say good-bye.
F	TESS	Oh... then... good-bye.
M	DANNY	Good-bye.
M	DANNY	Be good.
F	TESS	Good-bye, Danny.
M	PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1	Mr. Ocean. Mr. Benedict would like to see you.
M	DANNY	I thought he might.
M	LINUS	Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Escalante. Or should I call you Mr. Catton?
M	LINUS	You are Frank Catton? Formerly of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system?
M	LINUS (CONT'D)	Your silence suggests you don't refute that. Mr. Benedict, I'm afraid you've been employing an ex-convict. As you know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids...
M	FRANK	Goddamn cracker...
M	LINUS	Pardon me.
M	FRANK	You heard me. Just 'cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state...
M	LINUS	That has nothing to do with...
M	FRANK	... some cracker cowboy like you's gotta kick him out on the street. Want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, won't let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack.
M	LINUS	I resent your implication that race has anything to do with this. Now, as I was saying, the Nevada Gaming Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored... ... I mean...
M	FRANK	Okay, okay, I'm cool.
M	BENEDICT	You alright?
M	LINUS	Yeah.
M	RUSTY	He's got it. Virgil, Turk: deliver your package.
M	VIRGIL	Aw, I think... Jesus. I lost my card.
M	SECURITY OFFICER	What's going on here?
M	VIRGIL	I think... Jesus! I lost my keycard.
M	SECURITY OFFICER	Okay. Leave the cart. Go find it. Take this cart inside.
M	WALSH	There it is now.
M	SAUL	Wonderful.
M	RUSTY	That's my cue. Give Basher the go.
M	LIVINGSTON	Bash, what's your status?
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	Bash!
M	BASHER	No need to yell. What's your status?
M	BASHER	I'm there.
M	BENEDICT	Please show this man off the premises. Don't step foot in my casino again.
M	FRANK	Cracker.
M	BENEDICT	Mr. Wills, if you don't mind... Mr. Wills?
M	LINUS	Of course.
M	LINUS	My beeper. I'm sorry. I forgot it.
M	BENEDICT	You know how to get back out?
M	LINUS	Of course. Enjoy the fight.
M	BENEDICT	Thank you.
M	FRANK	Thanks, fellas.
M	DANNY	How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict will be?
M	GOON #1	Just a few minutes more.
M	DANNY	No cameras in this room, huh? Don't want anyone seeing what happens here?
M	DANNY	He's not coming, is he?
M	DANNY	Who is? teeth...
M	DANNY	I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like me talking to his girl.
M	GOON #1	We're gonna step outside now. Leave you two alone to talk things over.
M	DANNY	Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.
M	BRUISER	Sorry, Danny. I -- I forgot.
M	DANNY	S'okay. How's the wife?
M	BRUISER	Pregnant again.
M	DANNY	Then we better get to work.
M	LIVINGSTON	Oh shit...
M	WALSH	Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?
M	SAUL	Yes, I'm very satisfied.
M	WALSH	Close it up.
M	FAT	You alright, sir?
M	LIVINGSTON	Almost there, kid.
M	FAT	Who's that? him, their backs turned as...
M	LIVINGSTON	Going to video now.
M	WALSH	Call for a doctor.
M	DANNY	You didn't really think I was gonna sit this one out, did you?
M	LINUS	What, didn't you trust me?
M	DANNY	I do now.
M	RING ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen!!
M	RUSTY	Someone called for a doctor?
M	LINUS	How'd you get here?
M	DANNY	Crawlspace. And I had to give away a couple mil.
M	LINUS	But what about -- I mean, that whole thing with Rusty...
M	DANNY	You think the kid bought it?
M	RUSTY	Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew we were screwing around. You sure about this?
M	DANNY	Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first time. Least I could do is give his kid a push.
M	LINUS	Why'd you make me go through all this? Why not just tell me?
M	DANNY	Well, where's the fun in that? C'mon: Yen's got about three minutes of air left.
M	RUSTY	He's gone.
M	WALSH	You're too late, guys. He's dead.
M	VIRGIL	I told you to hurry.
M	DANNY	Who do you like tonight?
M	LINUS	Huh?
M	DANNY	Tyson or Lewis.
M	LINUS	The fight...? Lewis. You like Tyson? How strongly do you feel about it?
M	DANNY	You looking for action?
M	LINUS	I'd go in for a buck.
M	DANNY	A buck it is.
M	DANNY	Livingston, we're set.
M	RUSTY	Livingston, we're set.
M	LIVINGSTON	Basher, we're set.
M	BASHER	Just give me a minute.
M	LIVINGSTON (V.O.)	We don't have a minute. Yen's gonna pass out in thirteen seconds.
M	BASHER	Then give me thirteen seconds.
M	LINUS	You ever rappelled before?
M	DANNY	Never. You?
M	LINUS	Nope.
M	BASHER	Ready. Then hit it.
M	BASHER	... One... FLAMINGO
M	BASHER (V.O.)	... two, three... ... four, five...
M	DANNY	Now!
M	BASHER (V.O.)	... six, seven.....
M	BASHER	... eight, nine...
M	LINUS	Aaaaahhhhh!
M	BASHER	... ten...
M	REF	... One, two, three...
M	BENEDICT	What the hell was that?
M	BENEDICT	The first goddamn round.
M	BASHER	Viva Las Vegas.
M	LINUS	You alright?
M	DANNY	No, but you're sweet to ask.
M	FRANK	Are they in?
M	LIVINGSTON	One second. I thought you got kicked out?
M	LIVINGSTON	This tape's from last night. Same guards, same...
M	LIVINGSTON	... shift.
M	UZI-CARRYING GUARD #1	Jesus, Ron, was that you?
M	DANNY	Not yet. Okay.
M	LINUS	You think Yen made it out okay?
M	DANNY	I'm sure he's fine.
M	LINUS	Jesus...
M	DANNY	There's a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door. Let's get him out.
M	FRANK	Fin says he shorts it.
M	LIVINGSTON	No bet. floor...
M	LIVINGSTON	Shit.
M	DANNY	Okay.
M	FRANK	That's it?
M	LIVINGSTON	There's still the five pins and the floor sensor. Not much we can do about that from this side of the door. But from this side...
M	BASHER	... a little bit of Semtex should do the trick.
M	DANNY	Counting down from twenty -- -- now. -- seventeen, sixteen, fifteen --
M	DANNY	-- eleven, ten, nine --
M	LIVINGSTON	Linus, can you read me? Linus, do not blow the door, you're about to kill Yen.
M	LINUS	-- five, four, three --
M	DANNY	-- one --
M	LINUS	What's wrong?
M	DANNY	I don't know.
M	LINUS	You check the batteries?
M	SAUL	Everything going okay?
M	LINUS	You know, you lose focus for one second in this game --
M	DANNY	-- and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining.
M	DANNY	Do it.
M	DANNY	Amazing?
M	YEN	Where the fuck you been?
M	SAUL	Ever been in love?
M	FRANK	No, I guess not. Not really.
M	SAUL	This is better.
M	BENEDICT	You gonna answer it?
F	TESS	I don't have a cell phone.
F	TESS	It isn't mine.
M	BENEDICT	See who's on the other end.
F	TESS	Hello?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	May I have a word with Mr. Benedict, please?
F	TESS	It's for you.
M	BENEDICT	Who the hell is this?
M	RUSTY	The man who's robbing you.
M	BENEDICT	What the hell is going on down there in the vault?
M	FAT	Nothing, sir. All normal.
M	BENEDICT	Show me.
M	FAT	All quiet.
M	BENEDICT	I'm afraid you're mistaken.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	You're watching your monitor? Okay, keep watching.
M	BENEDICT	Jesus Christ... In this town, your luck can change just that quickly.
M	BENEDICT	takes a breath and cups the phone, then Find out how much money we have down there.
M	DANNY	Good-bye.
M	BENEDICT	Alright. You've proved your point. You've broken into my vault. Congratulations: you're a dead man.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Maybe.
M	BENEDICT	May I ask: how do you expect to leave here, hmm?
M	BENEDICT	Do you believe I'll simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors?
M	RUSTY	No. You're gonna carry it out for us.
M	BENEDICT	And why would I do that?
M	RUSTY	Take a closer look at your monitor...
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	As your manager's probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	You may notice: we're only packing up about half that. The other half we're leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage.
M	RUSTY	You let our eighty million go, and you get to keep your eighty. That's the deal. You try and stop us, we'll blow both cash loads.
M	RUSTY	Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly. It's your decision.
M	RUSTY	Hi. knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches. He
M	BENEDICT	Make the call.
M	VOICE (V.O.)	911. Emergency response...
M	WALSH (V.O.)	Hello, this is Mr. Walsh at the Bellagio.
M	WALSH	We have an incident here...
M	BENEDICT	Okay. You have a deal.
F	TESS	Where's Danny?
M	RUSTY	He's fine. He wants you to go upstairs, and watch TV.
F	TESS	He does?
M	BENEDICT (V.O.)	You have a deal.
M	RUSTY	It's alright, Tess. I promise. Good. Here's what you do. Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	If they meet anyone, we'll blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	One minute after that, the elevator will rise to your cages. Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino.
M	RUSTY	If they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if there's any indication a switch has been made, we'll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.
M	BENEDICT	He's in the casino right now.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Of course, I'm in the casino. In fact, I'm staying in your hotel. And I have two words for you: mini-bar. Now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor...
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	... a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station.
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	Your guards will load the bags into the van's rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we blow everything. Now what? Now, when I get word that the van hasn't been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you'll get your vault back.
M	BENEDICT	Sir, I have complied with your every request, would you agree?
M	RUSTY (V.O.)	I would.
M	BENEDICT	Good. Now I have one of my own. Yes?
M	BENEDICT	Run and hide. If you get picked up next week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I'll be supremely disappointed. Because I want my people to find you. And rest assured: when they do, they won't hand you over to the police. Run and hide. That's all I ask.
M	WALSH	Our guys say the van is headed toward McCarren Airport.
M	BENEDICT	Get everyone in position. I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac.
M	BENEDICT	Where's Zerga? Mr. Zerga? With the briefcase?
M	WALSH	He's -- he died.
M	SWAT LEADER (V.O.)	Night goggles on. Prepare to cut power.
M	FAT	Ready when you are.
M	BENEDICT	Do it.
M	SWAT LEADER (V.O.)	Cut it.
M	SWAT FREQUENCY (V.O.)	First wave, in! Second wave, now! Guys, someone's here! Take him down! Now!
M	SWAT FREQUENCY (V.O.)	Lights! We need power now!
M	BENEDICT	What's the situation down there?
M	SWAT LEADER (V.O.)	They blew it. They blew the... Oh, Jesus... If there was anyone in there, they're not in one piece anymore.
M	BENEDICT	Tell them to take the van. I'm going down there. Find out how they fiddled with our cameras.
M	HEAD GOON	Get out of the van, now! Now! Livingston's "spider."
M	SWAT LEADER	Mr. Benedict...
M	BENEDICT	Yes.
M	SWAT LEADER	We couldn't find any survivors. Or, I'm afraid, any of your money. I'm sorry, sir.
M	BENEDICT	Take your men out now.
M	SWAT LEADER	Okay, guys, grab your gear and clear out.
M	BENEDICT	Walsh: How are we with the van?
M	HEAD GOON	Out of the van now! Hands up!
M	EMPLOYEE	Hey, what's going on here?
M	TISHKOFF	Enough monkey business. Mr. Benedict...
M	BENEDICT	Yes?
M	WALSH (V.O.)	They took the van.
M	BENEDICT	And?
M	WALSH (V.O.)	And they blew up the bags, sir.
M	BENEDICT	Shit. Sir... sir...
M	BENEDICT	What, Walsh? They say it doesn't look like there was any money in the bags, sir.
M	BENEDICT	What?!
M	WALSH (V.O.)	They say the bags were filled with fliers. For hookers.
M	BENEDICT	What do you mean there was no money in the bags?
M	WALSH (V.O.)	That's what they said, sir. I don't understand it: we both saw them putting money inside those bags.
M	BENEDICT	Walsh, cue up the tape of the robbery.
M	BENEDICT (V.O.)	Does it say 'Bellagio' on the south wall of the vault?
M	WALSH	No, sir. It doesn't. I -- I don't understand...
M	BENEDICT	We had that installed on Tuesday. The image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape. What?
M	BENEDICT	Someone built a double of my vault, then made a tape of them robbing it. When we saw them putting money in those bags, that wasn't actually happening.
M	WALSH	Then, sir... ... what happened to all the money?
M	LIVINGSTON	9-1-1. Emergency response.
M	RUSTY	Prepare to cut power!
M	LINUS	Guys, someone's here!
M	RUSTY	Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction... Hit it.
M	BENEDICT	Ocean...
M	BENEDICT	Where's Ocean?
M	PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1	Still inside, sir. With Bruiser.
M	BENEDICT	Open that door.
M	BENEDICT	Wake him up.
M	DANNY	Heya, Benedict... How's the other fight going?
M	BENEDICT	Did you have a hand in this? Did you?
M	DANNY	Did I have a hand in what?
M	BENEDICT	Get him out of here.
F	TESS	Hello? Turn to Channel 88.
M	DANNY	You get robbed or something, Benedict? Geez, that's a shame.
M	BENEDICT	Stop there.
M	BENEDICT	Where. Is. My. Money.
M	DANNY	What would you say if I told you you could get your money back... ... if you gave up Tess? What would you say?
M	BENEDICT	I would say yes.
M	DANNY	Well, that's very interesting... ... but I didn't have anything to do with it.
M	BENEDICT	Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And contact the police. I would imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation of his parole.
M	WALSH	Maybe we should have held him.
M	BENEDICT	No. Follow him. Everywhere. for...
M	BENEDICT	Tess... Tess?
F	TESS	You of all people should know, Terry: in your hotel, there's always someone watching.
F	TESS	Wait!
F	TESS	Danny... I'm sorry.
M	DANNY	I knew what I was doing.
F	TESS	I didn't.
F	TESS	How long will you be?
M	DANNY	Three to six months, I should think.
M	RUSTY	Looking for someone?
M	DANNY	Thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up?
M	RUSTY	Hello to you, too.
M	RUSTY	Your hair's grayer.
M	DANNY	Your eyes got closer together. How's life?
M	RUSTY	Life... is a roomful of pillows. C'mon...
M	RUSTY	Where do you want to go first?
M	DANNY	To a phone.
M	RUSTY	I stopped and picked up your personal effects, put them in the back seat.
M	DANNY	My what?
M	DANNY	I'm not sure these belong to me.
F	TESS	Sure they do.
M	DANNY	We need to find Rusty a girl.
M	RUSTY	There's a women's prison just down the road...
M	DANNY	You said you sold this.
F	TESS	That's what I said.
M	DANNY	Liar.
F	TESS	Thief.
