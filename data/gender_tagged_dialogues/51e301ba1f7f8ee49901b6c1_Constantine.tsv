He's going to take all that out on you, John, and he's going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time.
M	You're the one soul the man	himself would actually come up here to collect. And you know how much he despises this place. scratching fingers across a blackboard. No way.

M	Each of you is born with the	promise of salvation preordained. The cost of your redemption is simple belief. And yet you whine about impossible rules. Sometimes I imagine you hardly deserve the gift you have been given.
M	Gift?! More like a curse the way	you manage things. stands and towers over John. account, John, but don't push me. isn't it? I didn't go to church enough? I didn't pray enough?

M	My sister always talked about a	world better than this. Heaven as some call it. She wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her. What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life -- mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity. That about right? words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless. turns and starts out, slows -- Hell. tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He something's not right.

It's crossing over that's the real trick. That's why most demons can only whisper in our ears. But even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare. Hennessey is on a quest.

M	She'd tell everyone about things	she said she saw. Crazy things. Things that hadn't happened yet. She'd scare my mother to death, talking on and on about Revelations and the end of the world. Then one day she just stopped... never said another word. doesn't need to be reminded. It hurts even more now. locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he

What did she do, Angela? backs into a wall. Nowhere else to go now. would it be? Where would it be?! Where would it be? lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of There must have been a tree in our backyard... when we were kids... may not be buying it but he's not saying anything. There is no 14h act in Corinthians. face goes pale -- book of Ethenius. It's like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned.
M	Depends on which side of the fence	you're standing. stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl before? this side. closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela CHAPEL - HELL is now facing books with completely different turns, covered in sweat.

That goes double for us -- God's most prized creations. Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over.
M	But demons can't come and go,	that's what you said. Some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to Hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit she'd pull out.
M	But even a bridge wouldn't help	Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God. sits back, letting that sink in. That's what makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side. herself.
