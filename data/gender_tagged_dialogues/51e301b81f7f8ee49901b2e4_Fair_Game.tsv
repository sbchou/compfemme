M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	VOICE V/O (VALERIE)	Everything you face in life. Everything you come up against..
M	VOICE (VALERIE)	Everything that stands in your way.
M	VOICE (VALERIE)	..your foes, your fears, your terrors....your darkest nights.
M	VOICE (VALERIE)	..are all sent to ask you the same question. The only question..
M	VOICE (VALERIE)	Who are you?
F	VALERIE	Jessica McDowell. Cognis Chemicals. I hope I'm not late.
M	CHANEL SUIT	When do you leave Kuala Lumpur, Ms. Macdowall?
F	VALERIE	I fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back to Dusseldorf. I really only need five minutes of his time..
M	CHANEL SUIT	I hope we are lucky. He is very busy man.
M	SECRETARY	Mr Tabir very busy this morning.
F	VALERIE	Oh I can imagine.
M	VOICE (HAFIZ O.S)	Seeing's we're waiting..
M	HAFIZ	..why don't you practice your little pitch on me?
F	VALERIE	Actually. If it's all the same-
M	HAFIZ	I know all my uncle's business. He trusts me. Begin.
F	VALERIE	Well. I'm sure you're aware Mr.. You're aware that recently your subsidiary, Kopa Oleochemicals developed an organic, ester based lubricant derived from Kernel oil, that makes offshore drilling significantly more environmental. My company, Cognis CMBH wants-
M	HAFIZ	You American?
F	VALERIE	Canadian. Actually. From Toronto.
M	HAFIZ	You a Maple Leafs fan?
F	VALERIE	Right. Uh. No. Not really.
M	HAFIZ	You must be the only person from Toronto's not a hockey fan.
F	VALERIE	Oh I'm a fan. Dad's from Vancouver, so I'm a Canuck. Between us, the Maple Leaves suck. They should never have signed Mark Bell. Guy's a liability on an off the ice. So who's your team?
M	HAFIZ	I don't like hockey.
M	CHANEL SUIT	Unfortunately Mr Tabir has no window this morning. But tonight he extends invitation to private reception at his residence.
F	VALERIE	Is that ok? I really don't wish to intrude.
M	HAFIZ	Come to the party.
F	VALERIE	Mr. Tabir? Jessica McDowall, Cognis GMBH. Thank you for allowing me to come to your beautiful Home.
M	TABIR	How can I help you?
F	VALERIE	Mr Tabir I wonder if you had time to glance at our proposal which would allow Kopa to access to Cognis' current Petrochemical Service Partners. Essentially its-
M	TABIR	Please excuse me, I have to attend to something.. My assistant here will make you comfortable..
F	VALERIE	Hi. I was waiting for Mr. Tabir.
M	HAFIZ	My uncle had to leave. He asked me to drive you to his tennis club. You can have your meeting there..
F	VALERIE	Why are we stopping?
M	HAFIZ	Ms. Macdowall, my uncle believes that trust is something you earn. And he doesn't trust anyone until he knows them very, very well..
F	VALERIE	But he trusts you, Hafiz..
M	HAFIZ	How do you know my name?
F	VALERIE	Your car was swept an hour ago. Do not get out. If you get out of this car I can't protect you.
M	HAFIZ	Who are you?
F	VALERIE	Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW.
M	HAFIZ VALERIE	Who the fuck are you? NOW!
F	VALERIE	Listen carefully. Your uncle is in business with Abu Domar Khan-
M	HAFIZ VALERIE	smiling) with shipping, money That's bullshit. laundering and contraband components.
F	VALERIE	Khan has made contact with a terror organisation via an aid agency in Pakistan. They are seeking materials to build a weapon.
M	HAFIZ	Fuck you.
F	VALERIE	Your brother is in Kalutara jail in Colombo facing execution for trafficking. We can help him.
M	HAFIZ VALERIE	Bullshit. You can't help him. We can help him. Hafiz. Listen to me. Listen.
F	VALERIE	You have to think straight here Hafiz. Because I promise you one thing... Right now, you have no idea what we can and cannot do. We need information about your uncle. Contacts. Shipments. If you help us, we help you. If you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in Thailand and it won't be me asking the questions.
F	VALERIE	You will get a call at 8am. You'll be asked if you need a cleaner. You want her to come three mornings per week. Do you understand? I said DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
F	SUE	So after like six hours, he finally manages to stand up on the snowboard, and the instructor lets go of him and he just plummets.. I swear to god, he can't turn, slow down, for like four hundred yards.
M	BILL	And yet I'm incredible in bed.
M	JOE	Keep the change.
M	STEVE	So what do you do Valerie?
F	VALERIE	I work in Venture Capital. Brewster Jennings, here in Georgetown.
M	STEVE	Cool. So like net startups..?
F	VALERIE	Right. Retail and consumer.. Basically we create pooled investment vehicles..
M	STEVE	Sounds high risk..
F	VALERIE	I guess. But you know..high risk, high return. Pretty boring actually. So what do you do?
M	JOE DIANA	They're out of Corona. I got Me and Steve won't fly on the a Rolling Rock. same plane. We won't even get the same train together.
M	STEVE	We got the same train to your mom's.
M	LISA JEFF	It only takes one to fly a Disneyland. A sarin attack on station-
F	DIANA	Whatever they're telling us we're totally vulnerable. I mean who's protecting us.
F	VALERIE	It's real scary.
F	LISA	Joe. Would you risk taking your kids to Disneyland right now?
M	JOE	Absolutely not. Far from being a playground of the imagination, Disneyland is actually a giant clearing house for crappy merchandise. And Space Mountain is a major disappointment. Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas for kids.
M	STEVE	Vegas. A dirty bomb in Vegas.
M	JEFF	OK. You get on a plane, there's two guys with turbans, seats A1 and 2.
M	JEFF	They look nervous. They're sweating, saying prayers..
M	JOE	Ye Gods..
M	JEFF	Steve you have a two year old. You're off that plane. You're calling the cops. I think if we're honest we all are. Joe. Two guys. On a plane. Turbans. Praying. Sweating. What's the call?
M	JOE	Well Jeff..
F	VALERIE	Every time. Every time we go out.
M	JOE	He started it-
F	VALERIE	He's drunk Joe. Everybody's had a hard day. They're just trying to let off steam-
M	JOE	By invoking quasi-racist connundra? The guy's a parent.
M	JOE VALERIE	Is he telling his four year It's Diana's birthday. Jeff's turbans?
M	JOE	So?
F	VALERIE	So you can't call him a racist pussy.
M	JOE	If not sitting there while someone spouts obnoxious crap makes you an asshole. Then I'm an asshole. And you knew that when you married me. By the way. How was your trip?
F	VALERIE	Who's that?
F	VALERIE	Hello.
M	JOE	Hi. Forgive me. I was staring. It's just I'm sure we've met before.
F	VALERIE	So who am I?
F	VALERIE	Valerie Plame.
M	JOE	Joe. Joe Wilson.
F	VALERIE	Former Ambassador to Gabon. Ambassador in Iraq during the Gulf War. Married twice.. Has a reputation for trouble.
M	JOE	You've been misinformed. I was only acting Ambassador in Iraq.
M	JOE	So what do you do, Ms. Plame?
F	VALERIE	I'm an energy consultant for a firm in Brussels.
M	JOE	And do you enjoy your work?
F	VALERIE	I love it.
M	JOE	Val. Where's the babysitter?
F	VALERIE	Didn't I say? She can't get here til after lunch.
M	JOE	OK. I'll work from home this morning.
F	VALERIE	Are you sure-
M	JOE	Relax. Me `n Spongebob are on it.
M	JOE VALERIE	Break it up. Trevor don't hit We're having supper with the your sister. Mitchells Tuesday. But if you want to skip it they know you're busy-
M	JOE	I promise to behave.
F	SAMANTHA	I promise to behave.
M	JOE	See. We're all gonna be on our best behavior. Counter Proliferation tracks and thwarts nuclear and WMD acquisition by rogue nations and non-state actors. We're the fastest growing division in the Agency, which sounds cool but means you may have to share a desk. Work like hell for years you may get your own cubbyhole. And if you're a workaholic, they make you boss, and you get-
M	CPD AGENT	Bad time?
F	VALERIE	Hafiz hired a cleaner.
M	ALI	Gotta go. Kuala Lumpur just went live.
F	VALERIE	What time did he call this in?
M	CPD AGENT	11 hundred hours PST.
M	CPD AGENT V/O (CONT'D)	The asset passed the intel to the cleaner at approximately eight fifteen local time, this morning.
M	CPD AGENT (O.S.)	She made the drop fifty minutes later... just outside Ko Yonh Subway station..
M	CPD AGENT	..a field team picked it up and D and D'd it at the safe house..
F	VALERIE	We have a shipment. A holding company in Pakistan asks Tabir to purchase 200 un-identified units, trackable by part numbers, from..
M	ALI	Teludyne Electronics of Lowell Massachusetts.. The shipment is delivered to Goza Tech in Secaucus, New Jersey...
M	VALERIE (V.O)	There it's bundled in with a second shipment of legitimate electronic parts, and documentation attached that masks its point of origin.
M	VALERIE V/O	Its then dispatched as medical electronics en route to a company in Johannesburg South Africa. First it spends the night at a bonded customs warehouse in the Port of Jersey. That's the intercept.
M	SUPERINTENDENT	Can I help you?
F	VALERIE	Sir, we're from U.S customs. Can I take a moment of your time? polystyrene chips and comes out with a Coke sized white
M	ALI	What the hell is that?
M	DR FORSTER (O.S.)	A spark gap is a high energy voltage-controlled switching device. To detonate a nuclear bomb you need to be able to switch high voltage, high current electrical circuits at very high speeds to the nearest hundredth of a nanosecond.
M	DR FORSTER	The extremely short rise times are achieved by discharging a low- induct, high-voltage capacitor through the spark gap into the bridge wire inside the warhead. The ballpark is 5 kilovolt and 1 mf for the capacitor, with a peak current between 500 and 1000 amperes...
F	VALERIE	Does it have other uses?
M	DR FORSTER	High speed photography, industrial photo-chemistry. Zapping kidney stones.Is someone out there building the fire train for a nuclear device component by component? You're talking one helluva complicated process. This guy is just one tiny piece in the jigsaw.
F	VALERIE	This is a list of other components exported through the same network over the last 3 years. Tilt tables. timing equipment. High speed monitioring devices.
M	DR FORSTER	Quartz rate sensors. Calibration units... It's not kidney stones. Thank god you stopped this.
F	VALERIE	I'm not stopping it.
M	DR FORSTER	I don't understand..
F	VALERIE	We keep the transaction live. Trace it all the way to the end user.
F	VALERIE	The shipment arrives in Joburg on the 21st. It's put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in Dubai. Our asset meets there with the buyer on the 23rd.
F	VALERIE	Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond. Basically, they won't know it doesn't work til it doesn't work.
M	ALI	Can we put a wire on the asset?
F	VALERIE	Too dangerous. This network has avoided detection for years. Expect meticulous operational security and counter surveillance. Any questions?
M	DEPUTY CPD	Val. The chief wants to see you.
M	BILL	Val, seventh floor have issued a directive for a Joint Task Force on Iraq. We want you to head it up.
F	VALERIE	Yes Sir.
M	BILL	You can pick your team. This is top priority. Down the line D.F.U.
F	VALERIE	What about the Dubai op?
M	BILL	Mike says you got a hunch on the buyer.
F	VALERIE	Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National. Based out of Karachi. On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in Pakistan he's moving to an unnamed Gulf state..
M	BILL	Iraq?
F	VALERIE	Vaziri's devoutly Shia. Iraq's controlled by the Sunni. Saddam's Sunni. There's no way this is Iraq.
M	BILL	They're all good Muslims right?
F	VALERIE	And Martin Luther King and the KKK are both Christian.
M	BILL	Great job. From Monday, I need you both eyes on Iraq.
M	MIKE	D.F.U?
F	VALERIE	Don't fuck up.
M	PRESIDENT V/O	States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world...
M	PRESIDENT V/O (ON CNN)	They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred..
M	PRESIDENT	They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
M	JOE	Hey hey hey. Everybody OK? Let's take a look at you. Four arms. Four legs. No broken bones.
M	HEATHER	Hey kids! Joe I'm sorry I'm late.
M	JOE	That's fine. Look guys. Heather's here. How do you think she got the job?
M	ANALYST 1	Memo comes out saying we got two percent women in executive roles. It's quotas by another name. There's ten guys I could name could do the job better..
M	ANALYST 2	I wonder who's she's fucking.
M	VOICE (MIKE, O.S)	Don't you have a home to go to?
M	MIKE	DIA released the report Tuesday. WINPAC aren't buying and State kicked it back, but it's making waves in the Vice President's Office. What do you think?
F	VALERIE	He's qualified. He's been there hundreds of times. Knows the arena inside out.
M	MIKE	You don't look overjoyed.
F	VALERIE	He's been working hard to build his business. Then there's the twins. Money's kinda tight right now.
M	MIKE	We're at full stretch here. You know that better than anyone. He's helped us before. Could you ask him to come in?
F	VALERIE	You want to go out for breakfast. Or stay here?
M	JOE	I want to live with you.
F	VALERIE	There's something I have to tell you.
F	VALERIE	What are you thinking?
M	JOE	Is your name really Valerie?
M	VALERIE (O.S.)	Joe?
M	JOE	Hey.
M	JOE	Nice place you got here. Cosy.
F	VALERIE	I need to get you cleared.
M	JOE	You work in the basement?
F	VALERIE	Actually. I work in Georgetown for Brewster Jennings. We're a small firm of Venture Capitalists.
M	JOE	That must be interesting work. It pays the rent.
F	VALERIE	This is Joe Wilson. Joe, this is Mike, the Deputy Chief of CPD. I'll leave you guys to it.
M	MIKE	Mr Wilson, what can you tell us about Yellowcake?
M	JOE	I believe it's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs. But I'm not a scientist.
M	MIKE	What about Niger?
M	JOE	The UN Human Development Index ranks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world. I started my Foreign Service there. As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled back many times. Then as director of Africa policy for the NSC under President Clinton, I frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki. I know the former foreign minister. I know the Minister of Mines.
M	MIKE	The Office of the Vice President has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of Niger and Iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake Uranium ore.. I don't have to tell you how serious this allegation is.
M	JOE WILSON	No Sir, you don't.
M	MIKE	This is a request from the Vice President. Can you help us?
M	MINISTER (O.S)	Bien revenue a Niger M. Wilson.
M	JOE	Par la grace D'Allah. Comment allez vous, M. Bonzala ?
M	MINISTER	Last time we met I was Minister, you Ambassador. Now, thanks to Allah, we are free men. You're growing a beard, no?
M	JOE	So it would seem.
M	MINISTER	So tell me. How can Niger help its old friend, America?
M	TURNER	"In summer 2001 Iraq sought to purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4 aluminum tubes manufactured in China. The high spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the enrichment of uranium. In August 2001 J. Turner.." That's me.. "flew to Vienna, to meet with IAEA scientists. Mr. Turner produced this report, aspects of which represents the CIA's present position." I'm happy to take questions.
M	ANALYST	The INR concluded late last year that these tubes were probably for artillery use, and the DOE agreed they exactly matched those used by Iraq for artillery rockets.
M	PAUL	Where are the tubes?
M	TURNER	WINPAC has them. We've examined them. This is my point. None of you guys has even seen the tubes.
F	VALERIE	I've seen them.
M	TURNER	And when was that?
F	VALERIE	When I seized them last year in Jordan. When I headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at WINPAC.
M	TURNER	So I take it you're not a nuclear expert. These tubes are an EXACT match for those developed by German scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.
F	VALERIE	You're right. I'm no nuclear expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at Virginia U atomic facility is. He also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and lives in Austria, and he told him that the wall thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design.
M	PAUL	And the tubes are twice as long as Zippe's design. In fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that they're made of aluminium.
F	VALERIE	A metal that hasn't been used in gas centrifuges since 1952.
M	TURNER	I went to Vienna. Canada. I've worked on this for months. They're centrifuges. Fact.
M	PAUL	So basically, they're your tubes and if we don't let you win you're going home.
M	TURNER	That's pathetic.
F	VALERIE	Joe. No one is saying you're wrong here. But if you're right, it's huge. So we ask the question. Right? We have to ask the question.
M	JOE V/O	Niger has two Uranium mines in the Sahara desert. One's flooded. The other's run by COGEMA, a French subsidiary, jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans.
M	JOE	500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction, it represents a 40% production increase in the nation's annual output of uranium. A sale that size would leave a huge paper trail.
M	JOE (V.O.)	Any documentation would by law have to be signed by the Prime Minister, Foreign minister, and the Minister of the mines... But say it was an off the books deal..
M	JOE (V.O.)	How do you hide the transportation of 500 tons of anything, let alone lightly refined uranium? You're talking fifty semi tractor trucks on one road through villages where nothing passed for months except maybe one bush taxi. It would be the biggest event for months. To say they forgot, it's like kids forgetting Christmas.
M	JOE	The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by millions of dollars of U.S Aid, which continues to this day. It just doesn't make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline. For that reason, and the others I've given, it's my opinion that the sale couldn't happen.
M	JOE	What happens next?
F	VALERIE	They write a report. Give it to the analysts. It'll be re-written, then kicked upstairs where it'll be thrown in with whoever else's report they got-
M	JOE	You guys are hysterical. I can't believe you're actually gonna send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly the same questions.
F	VALERIE	You can't compile Intelligence from a single source? That's not Intelligence. That's an opinion.
M	JOE	I can save the CIA some air fare here. There isn't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened.
F	VALERIE	Say who?
M	JOE	Says me.
F	VALERIE	What if you're wrong? One guy says it's true. It's not true. Lots of guys say it's true, it's still not true. It's intelligence. It's slow. Painstaking. But it works. Checks and balances.
M	JOE	What am I, a check or a balance?
F	VALERIE	Probably neither. You're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine. But you did your job. You should feel good. They count on that. That's why they don't pay you.
M	JOE	I'm not feeling that 007 right now.
F	VALERIE	I can get the kids to make you a medal, if it'll help.
M	JOE	Us double oh's are more about the gratuitous sex.
F	VALERIE	I'll see what I can do.
M	JOURNALIST	Mr. President, in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that?
M	PRESIDENT ON TV	The idea of focusing on one person indicates people don't understand the scope of the mission. Terror is bigger than one person. So I just don't spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you...
F	VALERIE	Why is the OVP here?
F	VALERIE	Mike. The Vice President's men are here.
M	MIKE	What the fuck?
M	LIBBY	My name is I. Lewis Libby. I'm the Chief of Staff to The Vice President. You are?
M	ANALYST	Dave. I'm an analyst. In non- proliferation.
M	LIBBY	What can you tell the Vice President about aluminium tubes?
M	PAVITT	Relax Mike. The Veep's just dotting the i's.
M	MIKE	Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon.
M	PAVITT	Look. Cheney doesn't trust us. This shit with Dick goes back thirty years. It'll blow over. Where are we on Iraq?
F	VALERIE	Behind the curve Sir. Most of the intel is outdated. We don't have a single operative or asset in the country.
M	PAVITT	What about geo-satellite imaging?
F	VALERIE	With respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call.
M	PAVITT	So talk to the defectors.
F	VALERIE	The defectors are unreliable. Most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95. It's a racket. They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear.
M	PAVITT	So we're blind.
F	VALERIE	We need sources we can rely on. We need to get in close.
M	PAVITT	How close?
F	VALERIE	Inside.
M	BILL	Jim. Val thinks she can get us inside the weapons program.
M	PAVITT	How?
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ(V.O.)	The warping of the extra dimension is analogous to the warping of spacetime in the vicinity of a massive object eg: a black hole.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	Red-shifting, generates a large ratio of energy scales so that the natural scale at one end of the extra dimension is much larger.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ (V.O.)	It's an honor to meet you at last Dr. Harper.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	I was unable to attend your String- Gravity seminar at MIT but I read a transcript. Truly groundbreaking work.
F	VALERIE	Thank you.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	The Faculty have just moved me, so you must excuse the mess.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	My old rooms were on the other side of the courtyard. They were smaller but I got the morning sunlight. Will you settle for Peppermint tea. It's fresh.
F	VALERIE	Thank you.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	Tell me Dr. Harper, did you read my latest paper on quarks. I cite your 1995 essay more than once. I would be very intrigued to know what you made of my findings.. She sits forward.
F	VALERIE	Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She received a call yesterday requesting she stay home for 48 hours.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	I don't understand. Who are you?
F	VALERIE	I'm sorry for misleading you. But I'm here to ask you the same question. Because you are not Professor Aziz.
F	VALERIE	I'm sorry to surprise you like this Sir. Your name is Doctor Harif Al Fallari. You were born in Basra.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	Well. This is indeed a strange morning. Madam, there seems to have been a mistake. My name is Said Uhmah Aziz. I am a theoretical physicist. I model space. I've never been to Basra. I'm a teacher. I'd like to be of assistance. But I'm afraid I can't help you.
F	VALERIE	So you're not Doctor Fallari.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	Madam. I've never even heard of this man.
F	VALERIE	You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit. You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria. You didn't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	This is absurd.
F	VALERIE	You weren't tortured. Broken. You didn't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing.
M	PROFESSOR AZIZ	No.
F	VALERIE	Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters. They were taken by Uday Hussein's private guard. He never saw them again.
F	VALERIE	That didn't happen. They never existed.
F	VALERIE	I need names. Of your colleagues in the weapons programmes. The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it.
F	VALERIE	I know Tarif. I know what happened.
M	PROFESSOR	You know nothing.
M	SECRETARY	They're back.
M	ANALYST 1	The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet. They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes. Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long. Now you could argue that that's to disguise them, you could saw them in half. That's sixty thousand tubes. I mean whew. Saddam's gonna get the mother of all blisters..
M	ANALYST 2	How was it?
M	ANALYST 1	Don't make jokes. He thinks I don't know how serious it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we've gone back over and over it.
M	PAUL	OK. I'll handle this.
M	PAUL	And so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification, the analysis from the IAEA which I believe is numbered in the report.. Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet. They can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window. And maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says "so, tell me about gas centrifuges". That's literally the only time you should listen to these guys. If they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it's like a fish talking about water. We've been over this data with you now five, six times. And... We don't really know how you want us to play this..
M	LIBBY	Let me level with you here Paul. I don't know what these tubes are for. From everything you're saying, there could be something to this, but very likely not, right?
M	PAUL	Exactly.
M	LIBBY	May I ask a question? When you say we don't really know how to play this, what do you mean?
M	PAUL	I'm just saying I don't know how to say it any other way than that-
M	LIBBY	Except you didn't say `I' you said `we'. So you and the others have discussed how to "play" these briefings. Why does the CIA feel the need to play these briefings?
M	PAUL	No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn't mean what I just said.
M	LIBBY	Which part. The last part. Or other things too.
M	PAUL	I'm a getting a little confused-
M	LIBBY	You want me to come back?
M	PAUL	No. GOD no.
M	LIBBY	You don't know why I'm here do you? In 1991 the United States invaded Iraq, and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered Saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently high specification to make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile material. And not a single person at the CIA, from the DCI down to the janitor had the slightest clue that such a program even existed. So now, one decade on, are you telling me that you're 100% sure these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons?
M	PAUL	I..Sir..OK. With intelligence, nothing's 100 percent.
M	LIBBY	So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine percent sure? Ninety eight?
M	PAUL	You can't put an exact figure. You can't be that precise.
M	LIBBY	But if you had to say, could you say you're ninety seven percent sure? Is there a three percent chance you've got this wrong? Or four? Or five? Still pretty good odds. You like those odds Paul? You willing to put your name to that. Are you ready to make that call?
M	PAUL	I don't make the call, Sir-.
M	LIBBY	Yes you do Paul. Each time you interpret a piece of data. Each time you choose a "maybe" over a "perhaps" you make a call. A decision. And right now you're making lots of little decisions there's a real world where millions of people depend upon you being right. But what if there's a one percent chance you're wrong. Can you say for sure you'll take that chance and state, as a fact, that this equipment is not intended for a nuclear weapons programme?
M	LIBBY	Do you know what one percent of the population of this country is? It's three million, two hundred and forty thousand souls.
M	PAUL	Sir. We're not machines. We.. It.. We look at the evidence, we game it out. Not everyone agrees all the time. It's a process.
M	LIBBY	It's a process.
M	PAUL	Yes.
M	LIBBY	And not everyone agrees.
M	PAUL	Exactly.
M	LIBBY	Who doesn't agree?
M	ANALYST	What the fuck is Joe Turner doing next to the DCI?
M	ANALYST 2	Didn't you hear? Friday the DCI took him to the White House. He briefed the President on Aluminum tubes.
M	ANALYST	You're fucking kidding me. Its a dead end.
M	BILL	So we've got a list of names. The Mukhbarat watch the scientists night and day. Their houses are bugged. Their friends are followed.
M	TACTICAL COMMANDER	Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city.
M	BILL	You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks. You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to react unpredictably.
M	TACTICAL COMMANDER	What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets?
F	VALERIE	No. We've got 29 names. I want to get to them all.
M	TACTICAL COMMANDER	How? You can't use the inspectors. You can't use tac. The wall's too high Val. What are you going to do. Train a mouse?
F	VALERIE	Maybe.
F	VALERIE	Hey, did I wake you up?
M	JOE	It's three forty five..
F	VALERIE	I gotta go. I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes.
M	JOE	Well...how long this time? I mean... Do we need childcare for tomorrow-
F	VALERIE	I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on the post-it.
M	JOE	Right. Its on the post-it.
F	VALERIE	I didn't want to wake you. Are you OK?
M	JOE	We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter drop. Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old... Some- I don't know where you go. Who you meet. If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can't tell anyone because you were never there. I'd never know what happened. I don't know where you go.
F	VALERIE	I'm going to Cleveland.
F	VALERIE	I'll be home tonight. It's on the Post-It.
M	JOE	Have a nice day.
F	VALERIE	Dr. Al Haddad? Is there somewhere we can speak?
F	VALERIE	How long is it since you saw your brother?
M	SAWSAN	1989. I attended a medical convention over there. Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference. Twice in twenty five years. We try to stay in contact. It's difficult.
F	VALERIE	Would you like to go back and see him?
M	SAWSAN	You want me to become a spy.
F	VALERIE	We need to ask Sa'ad some questions. Do you think he would answer them?
M	SAWSAN	I'm a doctor. I work hard. I'm also a mother. I have a small girl and I'm all she has.
F	VALERIE	We can help your brother. Right now he is extremely valuable to us.
M	SAWSAN	And to Saddam. The Mukbarat watch him night and day.
F	VALERIE	He could come here Sawsan. He's an expert physicist. He'd have a job, his children, his family would be safe. You, your daughter could see him whever you want. Sawsan. Can you help us?
M	SAWSAN	I won't do anything to help you. I don't know you. I would only do this for Sa'ad.
F	VALERIE	Then do it for Sa'ad.
M	SAWSAN	What would I have to do?
M	AGENT 1	The pages of this notebook are fast burning. You write on them like normal, but if you need to destroy them in an emergency..
M	AGENT 1	You have two of these in your luggage. Now this is the only pen we want you to use..
M	AGENT 2	The ink in this pen is visible for 10 seconds. Only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be read.
M	SAWSAN	- I am not taking any of this. If the Mukhbarat find any of this they will do things to me you cannot imagine. Tell me what you need to know. I will memorise it.
M	AGENT 2	Ma'am, we have 50 very specific questions, some extremely technical.
M	SAWSAN	You have 206 different bones in your body. Do you want their names in english, latin or arabic?
F	VALERIE	How do you feel?
F	VALERIE	Just remember, if anyone asks you anything, if anyone stops you stay calm and tell the truth. You're just visiting your brother. Keep it simple and keep to the truth.
M	SAWSAN	Except it's not the truth. How do you do it?
M	SAWSAN	How do you be someone you're not? How do you lie to someone? To their face. How do you do it?
M	ALI	It's time.
M	ALI	Mukhbarat. Watching the flight desk on this side. Valerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as
F	VALERIE	You have to know. Know why you're lying. And never forget the truth..
M	BLITZER	We read in the New York Times today a story that says that Saddam Hussein is closer to acquiring nuclear weapons.
M	RICE	We do know that he is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon. That there have been shipments into Iraq of high-quality aluminum tubes that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs..
M	COLIN POWELL	And as we saw in reporting just this morning, he is still trying to acquire some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an enrichment capability.
M	RUSSERT	Aluminium tubes?
M	CHENEY	Specifically aluminum tubes. There's a story in The New York Times this morning. I want to attribute The Times. I don't want to talk about specific intelligence sources but it's now public that he has been seeking to acquire the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge.
M	MIKE (O.S.)	It's a coordinated leak..
M	MIKE	Someone in the OVP leaked to the New York Times and now they're across the networks quoting the leak. "Smoking gun". "Mushroom cloud". They're using the same words. It's co-ordinated.
F	VALERIE	I'm coming home. Is Iraq's regime of Saddam Hussein right now a clear and present danger to the United States?
M	CONDOLEEZZA (ON CNN)	There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a danger to the United States and to its allies, to our interests. The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.
M	JOE WILSON	OK. Number one I always open the window and close the door..
F	VALERIE	You can still smell it.
M	JOE	You want me to roll up a wet towel? Like a teenager smoking in his bedroom. Maybe sandbag my study?
M	VALERIE JOE	What's wrong with the deck? You used to smoke like crazy when I met you.
M	JOE	Oh right. Middle of winter. It's minus ten degrees. The whole point-
F	VALERIE	Put on a coat.
M	JOE	Valerie. Steve. Help me out. Val. The whole point of a cigar you gotta get a little Winston Churchill vibe goin'. Slippers. A crackling fire.
M	STEVE	Musty books, slippers. Maybe a faithful hound.
M	JOE WILSON	Exactly. You can't be freezing your balls off in a GOOSEDOWN alone in the dark.
F	VALERIE	Don't think Churchill. Think Scott of the Antarctic.
M	JOE	That's it. I quit.
M	VALERIE JEFF	Honey Joe that's terrific It's about personal choice.
M	JOE WILSON	My father smoked cigars at the dinner table for forty years. And look at me.
M	DIANA STEVE	It was on Blitzer and Meet It came from the Times. Judy the Press. All over the news. Miller. The New York Times. Exactly.
F	SUE	Can I ask a dumb question. What is an aluminum tube?
M	JEFF STEVE	They have the tubes Saddam They're for centifuges. For
M	FRED	How? Who knows what they are?
M	DIANA STEVE	Everybody knows they are. The question is what else does he have?
M	JEFF	Did you read about this Valerie?
F	VALERIE	I was in Europe on business last week. I missed it.
M	JEFF	Basically Saddam bought all these tubes. And we've nailed him. We got them. They're packed with uranium.
M	STEVE	They're not packed with uranium.
M	JEFF	Right. They're for purifying it. The bomb comes later. It's how you boil it up it to make the big one.
M	DIANA FRED	Look out Israel. Says who? It's a bunch of tubes.
M	JEFF	Joe you know about this stuff, what do you think they're for. These tubes. What's your hunch?
M	JOE WILSON	Well Jeff. I don't know anything about these tubes. I'm not qualified. But I suppose the real question here is-
M	FRED	It's a pretext! 50% of Americans think Saddam blew up the Towers-
F	DIANA	He's a threat. You can't tell me he's not a threat.
F	LISA	He's mad. Like Hitler. If we'd stopped Hitler in the thirties-
M	FRED	He's not Hitler. He's Saddam. We put him there. Why? It suited us. He's our fault. Always was.
M	JOE WILSON	Have you met him? Fred. Have you met Saddam? Have you looked him in the eye? Did he threaten you? Did he threaten to kill you? You don't know Saddam. You don't know what you're talking about.
M	DIANA JEFF	"I may be some time"..
M	VALERIE FRED	I'm sorry Fred. I thought we were just talking.
M	JEFF	What is this? Meet the Press?
F	LISA	Val's made a Lemon Meringue.
M	DIANA FRED	Yes please. Try and stop me.
F	SUE	Mmm...That smells good. Shall I get some bowls.
F	VALERIE	Thank Sue. Bottom cupboard.
F	SUE	We have a rule at home. No politics at the table. It always ends in a squabble. I mean, nobody knows what's going on over there. At the end of the day, who really knows?
F	VALERIE	You're right Sue. Who knows?
M	PASSPORT CONTROL	Its her.
M	MUKHBARAT OFFICER	Al Haddad?
M	MUKHBARAT OFFICER	Wait here.
M	OFFICER	Wait here.
M	SA'AD	How is my little sister?
M	SAWSAN	Sa'ad! I am so happy to see you.
M	SA'AD	I've a friend in security services. I've been a government employee for 25 years, there has to be some advantage. You can wait all day.
M	SAWSAN	The house looks very different. It's falling down. In `93 they bombed government buildings here. The foundations are shattered.
M	SAWSAN	Sa'ad I need to speak-
M	SA'AD	..I have been meaning to repaint the exterior..
M	SA'AD	..but it is difficult to find the time when I am so busy at work..but the gardens are still the same as when we were children.
M	SAWSAN	The gardens yes of course, I would like to see them.
M	SAWSAN	They can help you if you get out to the Kurdish zone.
M	SA'AD	I am watched Sawsan. If I drive even twenty minutes north of Baghdad they will stop me.
M	SAWSAN	They've given me questions for you.
M	SA'AD	What questions?
M	SAWSAN	How close is your program to a warhead? When and where is the first test scheduled? How much 235- grade uranium do you have? Identify other scientists in the program. Who in the military controls the program? Which of the- What is it?
M	SA'AD	They do not know?
M	SAWSAN	What Sa'ad?
M	SA'AD	The program was destroyed in 1991. The Americans destroyed it, they know that. My god..what else?
M	SAWSAN	How advanced is the centrifuge facility? Which method are you using to separate fissile isotopes?
M	SA'AD	This is insane. We don't have spare parts to keep a tank on the road. I have to work at a plant which develops fertilizer. They know. The inspectors are back. They know this. They must know.
M	PRESIDENT (ON SCREEN)	Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud..
M	ALI	You need to see this..
M	STUDENT	Mr Wilson. Jason Neal. How was your flight?
F	VALERIE	We need Mike to see this. And Bill. students.
M	PROFESSOR	Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, "If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope." Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand. He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero.
M	JOE	That's not quite true. It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room.
F	VALERIE	Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory. In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart. They're all say the same thing Mike. Everyone.
M	STUDENT	Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security?
M	JOE	I haven't seen the intelligence. I'm not qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I've looked him in the eye, so I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster.
M	VOICE - SERGEANT AT ARMS	Mr Speaker, the President of the United States!
M	PRESIDENT	Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead.
M	STUDENT	We'd like you to have this coffee mug. And some Pennants. For your kids. Thank you so much for coming and speaking to us.
M	PRESIDENT (ON TV)	We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America... Joe looks up at DEPARTURES: "AA22 DULLES. CANCELLED."
M	PAVITT	So you got thirty nuclear scientists interrogated by Iraqis, inside Iraq, who are all saying the same thing.
M	BILL	Jim, these people took a great risk-
M	PAVITT	To bring us what? I could have saved us the air-fare-
M	BILL	The White House is getting STOVEPIPED. Someone is cherry picking raw data and serving it up to the press as fact. And then they look to us to confirm it. It's bullshit.
M	JIM PAVITT	You know we can bark about this all night. But that's all we're doing. Barking. You, me, all of us.. We're guard dogs. We can bark and bark, but at the end of the day, someone's gotta listen. Because it's not our house. Even if it is on fire.
M	PRESIDENT (ON TV)	Today the gravest danger facing America and the world is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
M	JOE WILSON	Can I get an American please. Just a regular American?
M	PRESIDENT (ON TV)	U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Joe glances at the TV as he pays.
M	JOE WILSON	Thank you.
M	PRESIDENT (ON TV)	From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. JOE stares, motionless, at the screen. The only one awake.
M	PRESIDENT (ON TV)	Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Joe doesn't blink.
M	PRESIDENT (ON TV)	This nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come. We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. PUBLIC ADDRESS Ladies and Gentlemen Flight 22 to Dulles is boarding immediately at Gate 20. We apologize for the delay due to adverse weather conditions-
M	PRESIDENT	We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life and all of history. May he guide us now, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. JOE is motionless. ALONE. Staring at the screen.
M	SA'AD	What you doing? They're watching-
M	SCIENTIST	No one's watching. Not anymore. I think the Secret Police have their hands full.
M	SCIENTIST 2	We're free. Free to be blown to smithereens.
M	SA'AD	Least no Mukbarat gets to watch it.
M	SA'AD	It's good to see you, my dear fellow doctors...
M	SA'AD	My sister said the Americans could get us over the border.
M	SCIENTIST	And you trust them? Open your eyes.
M	SCIENTIST 2	And your ears. Your American friends are calling you right now.
M	SA'AD	It's our only hope.
F	VALERIE	Bill. Wait up.
M	BILL	Val, every Mobile Exploration Team is combing the desert looking for WMD. I can't-
M	VALERIE BILL	All I need's a couple units We're at full stretch Val. to bring these men and their Listen to me.. families into Camp Lima and on an air transport into Annandale.
M	BILL	Say we extract these guys. Bring `em home. Put `em on CNN. What are they going to tell us that the White House wants to hear? "Thank you oh and by the way there was no nuclear programme. There's no WMD. PS you all knew that." You want me to go to the DCI, ask him to sign off on his own funeral?
F	VALERIE	I gave my word Bill.
M	BILL	That's not my problem. I got bigger problems.
M	BILL	Why do you do this job? The paycheck? The holiday package. No. To make a difference. To act. To protect people. Then one day you realize you're not Superman. Sometimes you fail.
F	VALERIE	Hold the elevator please.
F	VALERIE	What the fuck is going on Mike. It's like, if there was a baby on the ledge up on seventh, no-one would get up and save it in case the White House wanted it there.
M	MIKE	Bill's right. This is just one snafu in a thousand we got right now. The scientists are-
F	VALERIE	These scientists are the WMD. If we can't protect them, they'll run to the first country who can. And they'll put them to work.
M	MIKE	I never said this. If anyone asks, I deny any knowledge. How quietly can you do this?
F	VALERIE	Beth! Who do you have in Baghdad? I need to get an RG-17 to an asset in Mansour.
F	BETH	Why don't your guys to do it?
F	VALERIE	I'm asking you.
M	SA'AD	I need to know my family will be safe.
M	SA'AD	My wife, my children. They are all I care about.
F	VALERIE	Sa'ad, I know that. We will take care of your family. But we have to move fast.
M	SA'AD	How do I know I can trust you?
F	VALERIE	Sa'ad. Do exactly as I say, we won't let you down.
M	PETE	So how's Val? Is she there? Put her on..
M	JOE	She's fine. She's working late.
M	PETE	Val's working late. I'm working late. You don't see a pattern here? You know she finds me devastatingly attractive-
M	JOE	Yeah. Well if you see her say hi. Listen Pete. I have a question. And it's real important.
M	BACK TO:	THE STATE DEPARTMENT. PEOPLE COME AND GO. AT HIS DESK, PETE
M	JOE WILSON (O.S.)	Is the President be referring to another African country?
M	PETE	I've seen the INR. It's Niger. He's referring specifically to Yellowcake from Niger. Why?
M	PETE	Uh huh.. I see..I see. What exactly are you proposing to do Joe?
M	JOE WILSON	I don't know. I don't know what to do.
M	PETE	You want my advice? Do nothing. You already did your job. You did your best. You came home. End of story.
M	JOE WILSON	Niger Pete. Yellowcake from Niger.
M	PETE	Look. I don't have to go all the way to Africa to know something's fucked up here. Three months and what have we found? No centrifuges. No yellowcake. No bio. No WMD. You think something's up here. Join the queue. Join the line stretches all the way from State to the Pentagon and back.
M	JOE WILSON	So why has no one's come forward?
M	PETE	Why you think Joe? We went to war. Listen. You're a smart guy. As your friend, now. Just. Be smart here. I mean..you have a wife and a family.
M	JOE WILSON	It's the White House Pete. It's the President of the United States.
M	PETE	Yes it is Joe. Now go take a long look in the mirror and say that again.
M	JOE	Hey. Are you OK?
M	JOE	What's wrong Val?
F	VALERIE	Nothing. I'm just tired..
M	JOE	Whats the matter..what happened?
F	VALERIE	I'm fine. Are the kids asleep.
M	JOE	Yeah. They're asleep.
F	VALERIE	OK. I'm going to bed.
M	BUSH (ON TV)	Let me finish..No. Let me finish. Joe looks at the TV. He sets his jaw.
M	BUSH (ON TV)	There are some who feel like that, the conditions are such that they can attack us there. My answer is bring 'em on. . CLOSE UP ON JOE THE PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE AND GEORGE HW BUSH
M	REPORTER	Retired Ambassador Joe Wilson yesterday claimed in a piece in the New York Times that the President mispoke in his State of the Union Address in January, concerning claims that Saddam sought 500 tons of Yellowcake from Niger. Wilson, who was acting Ambassador in Iraq during the first Gulf War, said- Look. There's zero, nada, nothing, new here. The President's statement in the State of the Union was much broader than the Niger question.
M	JOURNALIST	Is the President's statement correct?
M	FLEISCHER:	Yes, I see nothing that goes broader that would indicate that there was no basis to the President's broader statement. But specifically on the yellow cake, the yellow cake for Niger, we've acknowledged that that information did turn out to be a forgery.
M	JOURNALIST 2	The President's statement was accurate? We see nothing that would dissuade us from the President's broader statement.
M	JOURNALIST	So you believe the British report is true?
M	MR. FLEISCHER:	I'm sorry?
M	CARD	Uh-oh. Sorry, I see what David is asking. Let me back up on that and explain the President's statement again..
M	HADLEY	Linda. Clear my morning.
M	JOURNALIST	So it was wrong?
M	FLEISCHER	Let me do this, David. On your specific question I'm going to come back to you.
M	ROVE	What is that tit-fuckin' homo Fleischer doing to us? Call Mary. Call Scooter. Call Hadley. We need to get a hold of this. NOW!
M	MARTIN LIBBY	Fleischer ploughed the I saw. briefing-
F	MARTIN	-CBS know Yellowcake was pulled from Cincinnatti ten weeks ago at the CIAs request. They also have that Gerson wrote both speeches. Karl is on line one. He's unhappy-
M	LIBBY	I want a transcript of everything across networks, blogs and print citing Ambassador Wilson, Niger or Yellowcake. I want Hadley to meet me in the VP's office in five minutes. And tell Karl I'll be in my office straight after I'm done. I have something.
M	LIBBY	This has become a trust issue for the President. We can't get behind this. We need to change the story.
M	ROVE	Who is Joe Wilson?
M	LIBBY	Linda. You still here. It's late..
M	ROVE	We can't do this.
M	LIBBY	So who can?
F	VALERIE	The CIA's decision to send retired diplomat Joseph C. Wilson to Africa-
M	JOE WILSON	Further down.
F	VALERIE	Wilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame..
M	JOE	"is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction."
M	JOE	They just went ahead and did it.
F	VALERIE	Does this run overseas?
M	VALERIE JOE	The column. Novak's column. If it's in the paper it's on
M	JOE	Valerie. Where are you going?
M	NEIGHBOUR (O.S.)	Morning Valerie!
M	DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS	Good morning. Please..sit down.
F	VALERIE	Good morning Sir. Ma'am.
M	DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS	Working backwards, we need a matrix of everyone you've come into contact with in a covert capacity back to January 2001.
F	VALERIE	I've already started a list Sir.
M	DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS	Good. We need to get an idea..fast, of how much this thing bleeds.
F	VALERIE	Sir, I have several live ops at crucial stages, people in the field in critical windows of operation-
M	BILL	One thing at time. Make a list. Then come back here. Don't do anything else.
F	VALERIE	Sir, why is Internal security here?
M	BILL	To help us. To help you, and us conduct this damage assessment.
M	INTERNAL SECURITY	This way please.
M	INTERNAL SECURITY	Ms Plame.
M	INTERNAL SECURITY	Ms Plame.
M	INTERNAL SECURITY (O.S.)	Ms. Plame.
F	VALERIE	Mike. We need to get a message to Baghdad. Sa'ad and his family are being taken to the border today. I have to get word to them.
M	MIKE	I don't what you're talking about..
F	VALERIE	Mike. They're packed and ready. Mike you know what this means.
M	MIKE	Sorry. I have to go. Valerie.
M	BILL	Go fuck yourself.
M	BILL	Sit down Valerie. I've just been on the seventh floor. As of this morning all CPD operations involving you have been suspended. Effective immediately you are to have no further contact with assets or agents in the field. Any further involvement in operations is no longer possible.
F	VALERIE	Bill. I have eight, nine teams in the field. We have assets in Kuala Lumpur. Dubai. Mumbai.
F	VALERIE	I need to brief my replacement in the Joint Task Force. The head of the JTFI's identity is classified for reasons of operational security.
F	VALERIE	I have a critical operation in Baghdad in a major ongoing-
M	BILL	Val. It's over.
M	JOE	"Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger" That means a Vice President, a chief of staff or top advisor.. I gotta go.
F	VALERIE	Hey guys. Give mommy a kiss.
M	TREVOR SAMANTHA	Mommy! Mommy. Trevor won't let me borrow his Power Ranger.
F	VALERIE	Well, did you say "Please"?
F	SAMANTHA	I said please. It's not fair. I drew a clown and a There's a 1982 act states scarecrow. it's a crime for a government official to intentionally VALERIE disclose a covert agent. Let's see. Carries a fine of fifty thousand dollars and or up to ten years in jail.
F	VALERIE	Wow. That is one cool scarecrow. Don't eat that Sam. It's a crayon. It's icky. Give it to mommy.
M	JOE WILSON	How did it go?
M	JOE	It's been ringing all day.
F	VALERIE	Don't pick it up. Who've you spoken to? Joe, who have you spoken to?
M	JOE WILSON	Hello? It's Lisa.
M	JOE	OK who wants to watch TV?
F	VALERIE	Hello?
F	LISA	Val. Are you OK? Whats going on?
M	BACK TO:	
F	VALERIE	Lisa. Yes. I read it. Listen- I'm sorry..I can't talk about this. I can't..I can't make a comment on this right now.
F	LISA	You can't make "a comment"? Val. Your name is in the paper. It says you're a CIA agent.
F	VALERIE	I have to go. I'm sorry. I'll call you tomorrow.
M	JOE	Your mom called. And your Uncle. And Janey called from Chicago. I wrote them down. And Andrea Mitchell called. She says White House sources say that quote "the real story here is not the sixteen words but Wilson and his wife". Would I care to comment? Yeah I fuckin' would care to comment. She wants me on the show day after tomorrow.
F	VALERIE	I don't want you to go on TV.
M	FLOOR MANAGER	Going in thirty seconds. JOE ON NBC NIGHTLY NEWS
M	JOE	This is clearly designed as a shot across the bow to those who might step forward, those unnamed analysts who said they were pressured by the White House would think twice about having their own families names being dragged through this particular mud.
M	JOE	I was sent to Niger at the request of the Vice President. I was not sent by my wife. The issue here is not who sent me here is whether a crime has been committed.
M	ANCHOR	You're saying a crime was committed
M	JOE	It is a crime to reveal the identity of a covert agent working in the employ of this nations intelligence agencies. This is now a matter for the justice department Pete. establish whether those in the Highest Office sought to destroy the career of a public servant to punish me for speaking the truth.
M	MCLENNAN	First of all, that is not the way this White House operates. The President expects everyone in his administration to adhere to the highest standards of conduct. No one would be authorized to do such a thing.
M	REPORTER	Will the President move aggressively to see if such a transgression has occurred in the White House?
M	PRESIDENT	This is a very serious matter, our administration takes it seriously. I've got all the confidence the Justice Department will do a good, thorough job. I want there to be full participation, because, April, I am most interested in finding out the truth.
M	JOE (ON PHONE)	Valerie. Turn on MSNBC.
M	MSNBC VALERIE	A team of federal Honey, Mommy's trying to investigators have been listen to the TV. assembled by Attorney General John Ashcroft as part of a alleged leaking of a covert CIA agent's identity to the press..
M	JOE WILSON	They've launched an investigation. Ashcroft just announced it. They're saying he's going to convene a grand jury.
F	VALERIE	I have to go. Samantha's crying.
M	JOE WILSON	I'll be home later. I gotta go over to Fox. They want me to comment on the investigation.
F	VALERIE	Joe-
M	JOE WILSON	We have to fight this Val. If we don't push back.
M	JOE	I have another call. I have to go.
F	VALERIE	Joe-
M	JOE	Joe Wilson.
M	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Joe, its Chris Matthews. I just spoke to Karl Rove. He told me "Wilson's Wife is fair game". So when did you join?
F	VALERIE	`84. Straight out of college.
F	DIANA	Jenny said it makes a weird kind of sense. Everyone says Valerie's a great listener. Asks lots of questions. About your job. About Steve or the kids.
F	VALERIE	I had no plan for this day. Right now it feels like I'm.. Everything is smashed into a million pieces. It's like I'm suddenly in this-
F	DIANA	Why did you do it?
F	VALERIE	What?
F	DIANA	Every conversation. For twenty years. Thousands of phone-calls. You lied to me on every single one. Nineteen years. Birthdays. My wedding. You're my best friend Val.
F	VALERIE	Diana. I know it's hard to understand, but it..
F	VALERIE	It becomes normal.
F	DIANA	Normal.
F	VALERIE	I know this is strange for you. And you may not feel like it's, but I need you right now. Because I'm-
F	DIANA	What? What are you? My ol' pal Val? I have photos. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs with this person. And.. I'm sitting here, and I know the face, I've known it half my life. What else do I know? Who are you?
F	VALERIE	Hey guys. How was your day?
F	VALERIE	Hello. Hello.
M	PHONE	Your husband is a fucking communist. I hope you die you fucking communist whore. Mommy. Trevor won't let me go on his tractor.
F	SAMANTHA	Mommy.
F	VALERIE	It's OK honey. Mommy's just tired.
F	VALERIE	So the caterpillar built a cocoon and it stayed safe inside for weeks. And when it emerged it was a beautiful butterfly..
F	VALERIE	Sawsan. What are you doing here?
M	SAWSAN	Your name and address are all over the web. There's even a picture of your house..
M	SAWSAN	Sa'ad has disappeared. His wife, his children are missing. My uncle in Mansour. He said they were targeting them. They were killing them..
F	VALERIE	Who?
M	SAWSAN	Sa'ad's colleagues. Dr Habbuck was shot dead in the street. Dr Falli was murdered in his hallway. They're killing them.
F	VALERIE	Sawsan, listen to me-
M	SAWSAN	I know you can't tell me where he is. Just tell me you have him. I beg you. Please. I don't need to know anything. Just tell me he's safe.. He's my little brother. Please. If you have him, if he's somewhere... Please. Please, I beg you. Do you have him. I have to know.
F	VALERIE	We don't have him.
M	SAWSAN	You said he would be safe. You said we would help. You promised-
M	SAWSAN	I trusted you.
M	MIKE	Valerie. What are you doing here?
F	VALERIE	Falli. Habbuck. Who else?
M	MIKE	Valerie-
F	VALERIE	Who else Mike?
M	MIKE	I don't know what you're talking about.
M	MIKE	You were right. It's all about the scientists. We made a call.
F	VALERIE	A call?
M	MIKE	We passed your case files to liason. You know yourself we're not great at this stuff. Val, Mossad were already on the same page. They've been trying to hunt these guys down since the invasion.
F	VALERIE	You've.. We're killing them. We're killing the scientists.
M	MIKE	Valerie-
F	VALERIE	You'll drive them underground. They'll run straight to Iran. Pakistan.
M	MIKE	Valerie. This isn't your problem anymore.
F	VALERIE	It's not my problem. It's not my problem. How can you sleep when you know-
M	MIKE	I sleep just fine. Now Carol's mother is here. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
F	VALERIE	It's called counter-proliferation, Mike.
M	JOE WILSON	At the end of the day, it's of keen interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog- marched out of White House in handcuffs. And trust me when I use that name, I measure my words.
M	SUPPORTER	We came all the way from Portland for this.
M	JOE	Your support means everything to us. Really.
M	SUPPORTER 2	You're a true American hero.
M	JOE	The real heroes are in Iraq right now fighting a war which was prosecuted on lies and falsehoods.
M	JOE	My wife and I have never sought publicity. But I know when I tell her about how much support there was here today, I know how thrilled and humbled she'll be.
M	PAVITT	Thank you for coming here today. I wanted to convey my outrage to you in person. In all my experience, nothing has disgusted me like this business. I know it's not easy for you, but I want you to know how much the agency appreciates your silence in the light of this matter. We know how damaging this has been to you. We can't afford for this knife fight to go on any longer.
F	VALERIE	I get death threats every day. People threatening to kill my husband. Hurt my children. I went to the agency and I requested security to protect my family. It was declined. Because quote "My circumstances fall outside budget protocols." If this is a knife fight, right now, Sir - we're fighting it alone.
M	PAVITT	Joe Wilson versus the White House. Well, all I can say is Good Luck. But as a friend, I feel I should tell you that those men..
M	PAVITT	Those few men in that building over there, that small white house, are the most powerful men in the history of the world. How much of a stretch do you think it would be for them to take on Joe Wilson?
M	PAVITT	Joe's out there on his own Valerie. But I know we can trust you. Speak to your husband. The nightmare scenario of an attack on a major city is as real, if not more real, than it was a year ago..
M	JOE WILSON	Tucker Carlson said yesterday that Wilson's wife sent him on a boondoggle. Said I needed the work. Who needs to work for free? Niger does have restaurants. The Opera. Reminds me alot of Paris.
M	RUMSFELD ON TV	We know if we do not fight the terrorists over there in Iraq, in Afghanistan and across the world, we will have to face them here.
M	JOE WILSON	Someone from Vanity Fair called. They want to do a piece on us. Cover-story. Five thousand words. In-depth interview. Photographs of the two of us. What do you think?
F	VALERIE	What do I think? Do I want my photograph in Vanity Fair? Is that the question?
M	JOE WILSON NEWS	We have to keep this as high In Baghdad today, co- profile as possible. We have ordinated car bombs killed to keep fighting. 175 in what is being called the worst day of insurgent violence in months...
F	VALERIE	I'm going to bed.
M	JOE WILSON	Val...what's wrong? What did I say?
F	VALERIE	My name is everywhere, Joe. My real name. Everywhere. All this publicity and noise and fighting talk, where is it getting us?
M	JOE	Karl Rove told the Financial Times they're rolling the earth movers over Joe Wilson. Quote. Earth Movers. Well I'm sorry but they don't get me without a fight. Not without a big fucking fight they don't.
F	VALERIE	It's the White House Joe. You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win. They'll bury us.
M	JOE WILSON	They'll bury us if we don't. How loud can you shout Val? Say we get in an argument you think you're right, and I think your wrong. You start making your point with all your might, and I start shouting back, except I'm the White House, and I can a shout a million times louder. Does that make me right? They lied Val. That's the truth.
F	VALERIE	By the time they're finished here you won't know what that is.
M	REPORTER ON TV	Today Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, in charge of the enquiry into the leaking of the identity of a covert agent announced that he is convening a Grand Jury to investigate the affair. Among the blizzard of subpoenas issued are ones for the Vice President's chief of Staff Scooter Libby, and special advisor to the President Karl Rove. Both men are under suspicion of having leaked the agent's name to reporters in order to damage former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal and combative critic of the administration. It is believed that the President himself has been questioned under oath by the FBI. Scooter home?
M	ROVE	Scooter.
M	LIBBY	What's that?
M	ROVE	Findings of the Select Committee on Intelligence. All five hundred pages and eleven pages of it.
M	LIBBY	Am I going to enjoy it?
M	ROVE	I know someone who isn't.
M	TREVOR	Look at the soldiers mommy. Look!
M	JOE	Go and play now.
F	VALERIE	Hey.
F	VALERIE	What's that?
M	JOE WILSON	That is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. On page thirty six it says "the former ambassador's wife offered up his name" and includes a memorandum written by Valerie Plame which says quote "my husband has good relations with both the prime minister and the former Minister of Mines, both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity." I've spent a whole year denying just this.
F	VALERIE	Joe wait-
M	JOE WILSON	Telling everyone who'll listen, on TV. In the press. My wife did not send me on a junket.
F	VALERIE	Joe. I didn`t send you. I didn't have that power.
M	JOE WILSON	You sent an email. The SSCI found the email.
M	VALERIE JOE WILSON	I write hundreds of emails. Why didn't you tell me? At no time in the past twelve months you never thought-
F	VALERIE	I didn't make the decision. I was asked to write a recommendation. What am I supposed to do. Not say my husband knows about this.
M	JOE WILSON	They have this now. They will call me a liar. It will stick. They have all the power here, what do I have? My word. You have to speak up. You have to go on record.
F	VALERIE	Joe-
M	JOE WILSON	You have to defend us. Now.
F	VALERIE	So what do you want me to do Joe? Go to the papers like you did? Write a piece in the New York Times? You know I'd have to submit it to the Agency, and they'll-
M	JOE WILSON	The agency? The.. Wait.. Is this the same Agency which won't give you protection for your children? Is this the same CIA that's erased your pension? Where's your loyalty Val? To your husband or the CIA?
F	VALERIE	It's to MY FAMILY. I put my family first. ALWAYS. Were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking article?
F	VALERIE	I'm taking different routes to and from school. I'm looking in empty rooms..under the beds every time I come home. A home we're going to lose because your work has dried up and your clients are running for cover. What has all this achieved? What changed Joe? Who won?
M	JOE WILSON	Maybe you're right. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. Is that what your dad taught you Valerie? That what Colonel Sam Plame said? A good American doesn't rock the boat. A good American looks the other way.
M	JOE	Did you send me to Niger? "His business is struggling. He's on the slide. I'll throw him a bone." Was that it Val? You pull some strings for me? You help your old man out?
F	VALERIE	How dare you?
M	JOE WILSON	Did you send me?
F	VALERIE	You think I'm lying to you.
M	JOE	Could I tell if you were?
F	VALERIE	You fucking bastard..
M	ANCHORMAN	The Senate Intelligence Committee published information that showed Joe Wilson had lied about how he came to be sent to Niger. He denied that his wife had any role in it whatsoever, but a memo Plame wrote on February 12, 2002 proves otherwise. MSNBC NEWS FOOTAGE The Senate Intelligence Committee let some air ­ a lot of air - out of Joe Wilson's overly inflated ego when it issued its first report on prewar intelligence. While the committee heaped most of its criticism on the Central Intelligence Agency for getting almost everything wrong about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction it pointedly rebuked the former ambassador and his infamous mission to Niger.
M	REPORTER	Mr Wilson, do you still maintain the Vice President's office sent you Niger and not your wife?
M	REPORTER 2	Mr Wilson was Niger just a free holiday? A boondoggle?
M	JOE WILSON	My wife did not send me. I didn't receive payment. It was not a holiday. It was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war. But the fact is no one wanted facts.
M	REPORTER	Are you against our troops Mr Wilson?
M	REPORTER	Mr. Wilson is it true you donated money to the Kerry campaign?
M	REPORTER	People are saying your wife does not actually work for the CIA.
M	REPORTER	Is it true she was just a secretary at Langley? Joe turns round, furious, as if he's going to punch the
M	JOE WILSON	No comment.
M	GUEST	The question still remains, who is Valerie Plame? Was she really simply a glorified typist?
M	ROGERS	Well, I think it's really all about the money. We're talking about a third-rate CIA agent who had a government salary, and she had sent her husband to Niger, and he had come back and didn't give the report to the CIA, but he turned it over in an op-ed to The New York Times. So she was already in the hot seat with the CIA, and so now she's all about the money. Plus it's come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best.
F	VALERIE	When we were at the "Farm", training to be field officers, they picked four or five of us and told us we'd stood out.
M	BACK TO:	
F	VALERIE	We were bound, hooded and thrown in separate cells. They beat us. Deprived us of sleep. All you had to do was give up the name of one of the others. Just one name. For a glass of water. A sandwich. To avoid another punch.
F	VALERIE	Another hour in a stress position.
F	VALERIE	They push you until they find it. Til they find the point at which you break. Because they have to know. You have to know. And one by one, everybody broke. Except me. I never broke. I've been in situations, places where I was afraid. Where if you made a mistake, one tiny mistake, at any moment.. But I never made a mistake. And that made me feel special. I thought: I'm Different. Bullet- proof. You can't break me. I don't have a breaking point. I was wrong.
F	VALERIE	OK. Say goodbye to your father.
M	JOE WILSON	Hey guys.
F	SAMANTHA	We're going on a mystery tour.
M	TREVOR	Why aren't you coming daddy.
M	JOE WILSON	Come here.
M	JOE WILSON	I'll see you both real soon OK?
F	VALERIE	OK guys. C'mon.
M	VALERIE'S MOM	Who wants to make toffee apples?
M	KIDS	Me! Me!
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	Well don't just stand there. Come take a look.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	It's cherry. I thought it'd work in your dining room. I can see the great and the good of Washington eating off this thing for years to come. Just sanding her down then she done.
F	VALERIE	It's beautiful.
M	VALERIE'S MOM	Sam. I keep telling you. They have a table.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	Well come here.
M	JOE WILSON	Good morning.
M	BUSINESSMAN	How's your wife Joe?
M	JOE WILSON	She's fine. She's well. She uh..
M	JOE WILSON	Hi. I'll just have a strong coffee. I'm not very hungry. So. How long are you in town for?
M	JOE	Can I help you? Excuse me. Can I help you?
M	RIGHT WING REPORTER	I'm just telling these people that you sir are a fraud.
M	JOE	OK. This is a private lunch. Please leave us alone.
M	RIGHT WING REPORTER	This man is a liar and a traitor. He is in the pay of left wing hate groups, he is a democrat stooge, and he is an anti-war zealot. He has stabbed our troops the back.
M	JOE	OK. Leave now.
M	BUSINESSMAN 2 RIGHT WING REPORTER	May we get the check? You have blood on your hands. You are a fraud and your wife is a traitor and a fantasist.
M	JOE	OK. Leave my fucking table. Now. How dare you talk about my wife? You don't know her. You don't know me. Now leave my table. Now.
M	RIGHT WING REPORTER	Ladies and gentleman. Joe Wilson. He likes to lie in the press and he likes to swear and insult women.
M	BUSINESSMAN	I think we should leave.
M	JOE WILSON	No. Please.
M	BUSINESSMAN 2	No really we should.
M	BUSINESSMAN	We'll call.
M	JOE WILSON	Shame on you. You call yourself a reporter. Shame on you. You're a self publicising hack. Fuck you. Fuck you.
M	JOE WILSON	Pallisades.
M	TAXI DRIVER	You OK?
M	JOE WILSON	I'm fine.
M	TAXI DRIVER	You're him. I see you on the TV. You're Joe Wilson.
M	JOE	No, I'm not.
M	TAXI DRIVER	Yes brother. I see you on the TV.
M	JOE WILSON	That's somebody else.
M	TAXI DRIVER	No no. I know you. My name is Joe too. I am from Sierra Leone. Freetown. You've been there, right. You like Freetown?
M	JOE WILSON	Joe, we both know Freetown's a shit- hole.
M	TAXI DRIVER	That's the truth. That's the truth right there, brother. Yes indeed. Sierra Leone is dying. The people at the top have too much power. WAY too much power. Over there we have no truth. Just power. People can't see that from here. Over here it's a different world.
M	JOE WILSON	I wouldn't be so sure of that.
M	TAXI DRIVER	How can you say that? Land of the Free, brother. Home of the Brave.
M	JOE WILSON	Can we pull over. I'm going to walk. Look keep the change.
M	TAXI DRIVER	Do you pray, Joe Wilson?
M	JOE WILSON	No.
M	TAXI DRIVER	I give you this. It is my church maybe you come. And if you open a bible, look John Chapter eight. Then Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Take care brother Joe.
F	VALERIE	How's is he?
M	MOTHER	Oh you know. Getting better. Shakin' through.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	OK. See those birds. Those guys. Those yellow fellas. See `em..
F	VALERIE	Yeah I see `em.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	OK. Listen. You hear that? Ain't that beautiful. They suddenly showed up last year. They're called.. What are they called? I know their name. They're called something. Anyway. They were here last year. And the year before. God they're beautiful. Look at that. They watch the birds.
F	VALERIE	Dad, I think my marriage is over.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	Well. I know my little girl doesn't say anything til she absolutely has to.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	I'm the same way. And I've said that too. Those exact same words. July 1972. Your mother and I were fighting all the time. I guess she was just plain tired of moving home. Wasn't `til I retired after 42 years in the Air Force, I realised we never had a home. Germany, Singapore, Australia, England. Heck I can remember the day you were born in a freezing cold airbase outside Anchorage Alaska. You must have been to twenty schools. Twenty different chances to introduce yourself. Be someone new. But you turned out OK. Responsible. A little too serious. Always looking down the road. Worrying where life was going to drag you next. But it made you tough. Real tough. Maybe tougher than I, or your mother, or anyone knows.
F	VALERIE	He wants me to go on the record. Speak out. Like that would suddenly make this all go away. We can't even speak to each other. I can't see how this comes round. I just can't see it, pop. Not anymore.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	What they did was wrong Valerie. Plain wrong. Never forget that.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	Say through some miracle you even get through this.. you and Joe are always gonna fight. You're fighters. He's a stubborn son of a bitch too. He don't give up easy either.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	One day this country is gonna look back on these years, and it's gonna hang its head. It's gonna weep. Then it's gonna stand up straight and walk on.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME	I swear to God, she's gonna keep at that until she licks it.
M	LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME.	They're tougher than we are. They'll piss you off from time to time, but they're built to last.
M	JANITOR	Mister? We're closing. You have to leave.
M	MSNBC	The vice president's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby Jr., was indicted Friday on charges of obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements..
M	FOX NEWS CNN	..in the CIA leak Karl Rove, Bush's closest investigation, a politically adviser, escaped indictment
M	CNN	The U.S. military death toll in Iraq exceeded 2,000 this week, and the president's approval ratings are at the lowest point since he took office in 2001.
M	MSNBC	At a news conference, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald declined to comment about Rove's involvement.
M	FOX NEWS	Asked about Cheney, he said: "I'm not making allegations about anyone not charged in the indictment."
M	CNN	Friday's charges stemmed from a two- year investigation by Fitzgerald into whether Rove, Libby or any other administration officials knowingly revealed the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame.. In a statement released Friday afternoon, Libby said, "I have conducted my responsibilities honorably and truthfully. I am confident that at the end of this process I will be completely and totally exonerated."
M	JOE	They served up Libby. He's taking the fall.
M	JOE	I bet they've already struck the deal. He takes the fall. He gets pardoned. The deck's stacked. I bet this doesn't even get to a trial.
F	VALERIE	Thank you.
F	VALERIE	I don't care how angry you get. I don't care what they say about us. I don't care if you hate me. If they take everything away from us, but they are not going to take this. They do not get to take my marriage.
M	JOE WILSON	I'm so sorry.
F	VALERIE	You did good.
M	JOE WILSON	I did it for me.
M	She shakes her head.	
F	VALERIE	I know why you did it. Thank you.
M	JOE	If I could give it back to you. If I could give you back who you were-
F	VALERIE	This is who I am. Right here.
F	VALERIE	So are you ready to fight?
M	JOE (O.S.)	How many of you know who put the 16 words in the State of the Union address?
M	JOE WILSON (O.S.)	Arguably the most important speech the president makes all year. Never more important when the nation is on the brink of war.
M	JOE WILSON	How many of you know who put it in? How many of you know my wife's name? How do you know one and not the other? How did the question move from "Why are we going to war?" to "Who is that man's wife". I asked the first question. Someone else asked the second. It worked. Its still working. Because we still don't know the truth. But you all know my wife's name.
M	JOE WILSON V/O	Public officials swear an oath to uphold the constitution. That is their duty. They must be kept to their oath. That is yours. This offense wasn't committed against me. Nor against my wife...
M	JOE WILSON	It was committed against you. And if you ever feel angry. Misrepresented. Ashamed even.
M	JOE WILSON (O.S.)	Do something about it. In 1787 as Benjamin Franklin left the Constitution Hall after the last drafting session, he was stopped by a woman on the street. She asked--
M	JOE WILSON	-what manner of government have you bequeathed us? Ben said 'A Republic madam. If you can keep it.'
M	JOE WILSON	If you can keep it.
M	JOE WILSON V/O	The responsibilty for this country does not lie in the hands of a privileged few.
M	JOE WILSON	We are strong and we are free from tyranny only for as long as each and every one of us remembers their duty as citizens.
M	VAZIRI	Welcome to the revolution my brother.
M	JOE WILSON	Whether its a pothole at the end of your street or a lie in the State of the Union Address..Speak up. Ask the question. Demand the truth.
M	JOE WILSON	Democracy is not a free ride...
M	JOE WILSON	Man I'm here to tell you that. But its where we live. And if we do our job its where our children will live. God bless America.
F	VALERIE	Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Valerie Plame Wilson, and I am honored to have been invited to testify under oath before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the critical issue...
M	REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE	...of safeguarding classified information. I'm grateful for this opportunity to set the record straight. I served the United States loyally and to the best of my ability as a covert operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency. I worked on behalf of the national security of our country, on behalf of the people of the United States until my name and true affiliation were exposed in the national media on July 14th, 2003, after a leak by administration officials. Today I can tell this committee even more. In the run-up to the war with Iraq I worked in the Counter Proliferation Division of the CIA, still as a covert officer whose affiliation with the CIA was classified. I raced to discover solid intelligence for senior policy makers on Iraq 's presumed weapons of mass destruction program. While I helped to manage and run secret worldwide operations against this WMD target from CIA headquarters in Washington , I also traveled to foreign countries on secret missions to find vital intelligence. I loved my career because I love my country.
