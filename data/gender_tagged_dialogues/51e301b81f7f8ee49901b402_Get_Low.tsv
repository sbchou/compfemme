M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BUS H	Just a boy, that's all. 7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7 The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees
M	HORTON	Mornin', sir.
F	BUSH	Hard life if you can't read..
M	HORTON	Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus Horton, sir, how you doing? Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton.
F	BUSH	
M	HORTON	Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has passed on, sir. His funeral is tomorrow and I thought you might want to know since.. What got him?
M	HORTON	Just got old, sir.
F	BUSH	Yeah, well.. Bush returns to chopping wood. Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.
M	HORTON	Mr. Starke told me that you and him ran away from home when you were 6 years old. Is that true?
F	BUSH	I talked him into it. Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.
M	HORTON	Well.. anyway.. I.. alright.. Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves.
F	BUSH	Well hell.. Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises. Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to
F	BUSH	Always thought you'd go first.. White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding
F	BUSH	Ahh, don't look so disappointed.
F	BUSH	You better not. Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.
F	BUSH	And coffee when we get there. Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off
M	HORTON	Buddy? But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around.
M	HORTON	Oh! Hello.. Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
M	HORTON	What can I do for you, sir? Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20's) enter from the Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.
F	BUSH	I can wait. Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods
M	HORTON	It's alright, have a seat. Bush sits down uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew
M	HORTON	What's on your mind, sir?
F	BUSH	Bout time for me to get low.
M	HORTON	Get what?
F	BUSH	Down to business Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of
F	BUSH	Need a funeral. Horton looks up from the money.
M	HORTON	For who?
F	BUSH	Me. Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as
M	HORTON	For you? You want to buy a funeral for you?
F	BUSH	Am I not talking right?
M	HORTON	No, yes, I'm sorry. Are you sick sir?
F	BUSH	Everybody dies.
M	HORTON	True, but..
F	BUSH	I don't take care of my bones it won't get done, will it?
M	HORTON	All right, I see. Well the church can help you get your affairs in order, arrange a service.. Horton glances at the strange wad of money again.
F	BUSH	What would you say?
M	HORTON	About what?
M	BUS H	Me.
M	HORTON	A eulogy? I.. don't know. What do you want me to say?
F	BUSH	Say what you'd say right now to my face.
M	HORTON	Well. I uh, I don't know much about you, Mr. Bush. I mean, I've heard stories but..
F	BUSH	What stories? Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too.
M	HORTON	Just stories.. .you know, people talking.
F	BUSH	What kind of stories? Say one.
M	HORTON	Sir.. my mother used to say that gossip is the devil's radio.. .not that she didn't play that radio at full volume now and then, bless her heart, but.. .what matters when you come to the end of your life is that you're ready for the next one. Have you made peace with God, sir?
M	BUS H	I paid. Horton has no idea what Bush means. He looks at the money,
M	HORTON	Well.. you can't buy forgiveness, Mr. Bush. It's free. But you do have to ask for it.
F	BUSH	Nothing in this world is free, preacher. Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out. His hand bangs Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind.
M	HORTON	That was, uh, different.
F	KATHRYN	I heard such awful things about him when I was a kid.
M	HORTON	My mother probably told you some of them. Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner Bush looks up and stares at him.
F	BONNIE	What are you doing, son? Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him.
F	BONNIE	Empty those cans in your daddy's truck and get back in here. Now. Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook.
M	GARY	Look at that. A mule drinking coffee!
M	CARL	Finally found somebody that likes Bonnie's coffee. As they move past, they see Bush standing there..
M	WORKER	Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush. Carl eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as
M	CARL	Hey.. I'm talking to you.. Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over
M	CARL	We know about you. You stay out of this diner. There's women and children here and we don't want you around them. Bush stands to mount up, never turning around.
M	CARL	You better hear me. I see you here again, I'll.. Hey! Hey! Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up. But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him. Old
M	CARL	Shit.. Carl moves up to try and calm him.. .as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees Bush
M	TOM	Daddy! Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush.
F	BONNIE	Stop it!! Get away! Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs I'll kill him! Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain.
M	BUDDY	Frank? There was a fight. It was..
M	FRANK	.let me guess. Hmm. Carl?
M	BUDDY	Well yeah but this time it was with that old man Bush.
M	FRANK	Old man? Is there a body?
M	BUDDY	No, the old man did the beating. Never seen anything like it.
M	FRANK	Social event of the year and I missed it. Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no
M	FRANK	Read the paper today? Something strange is happening in the world right now.
M	BUDDY	What?
M	FRANK	People are dying in bunches. Everywhere. But here. He puts the paper down and studies his socks.
M	FRANK	I wonder what the odds are of a funeral home going broke? I mean you have a business everybody on earth needs, you can't make that work, it's got to be you right? And yet.. I don't know.. what do you do when people won't die?
M	BUDDY	Well..
M	FRANK	Onethingabout Chicago, people knowhowto die; they drown, get runover,shot, whatever it takes.
M	BUDDY	We get it done down here, we're just not in a hurry about it.
M	FRANK	It's them or us. Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket. I might know someone who is looking for a funeral. Frank's eyes crawl over to him.
M	FRANK	How much did he have?
M	BUDDY	It was all wadded up.
M	FRANK	Ooo, hermit money. That's good. Buddy sees Bush's signs.
M	BUDDY	There it is..
M	BUDDY	What are you doing?
M	FRANK	You've been wanting a shot at sales..
M	BUDDY	But..
M	FRANK	As of right now, you're on commission. Remember; foot in the door, establish trust, and drop the hammer. Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.
M	BUDDY	I'd feel better if you'd go too.
M	FRANK	No doubt but if you don't do this by yourself, you won't know if you're any good. And you'll never be any good if you don't know you are. Go get him!
M	BUDDY	Hello? Nothing. He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away, Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind
F	BUSH	Want to see in my house, do you? BOOM! Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at
F	BUSH	How's it look? Buddy closes his eyes, his last words are for his wife..
M	BUDDY	Oh, Katie.. It makes Bush peek out from behind the barrel.
M	BUS H	You was at the church with your wife and baby. Buddy opens his eyes and can't believe he is still alive.
M	BUDDY	Yes, sir.
F	BUSH	What the hell you doing here?
M	BUDDY	I can't remember.
F	BUSH	What? They stand there while Buddy thinks..
M	BUDDY	Oh yeah, I heard.. you wanted a funeral.
F	BUSH	Funeral?
F	BUSH	Yes sir. I work at uh.. I work at.. .Quinn Funeral Home. I thought I could help you. Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'. He lowers his
M	BUS H	You like rabbit?
M	BUDDY	What? Bush goes inside. Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but can't see
F	BUSH	Sit down. There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off Bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit
F	BUSH	It's how you put things together, see? Some things go, some things never will. Indians said that everything spoke to them. That's how they made medicine and knew what to eat. Things talked to them clear as we talk. You believe that?
M	BUDDY	I.. I don't know, sir.
F	BUSH	If you don't listen you won't hear nothing. Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down.
M	BUDDY	Did you make this furniture, sir? Never seen any like it. Can't even tell what's holding it up.
F	BUSH	Magic. Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious. The word lingers.
M	BUDDY	Alright. Well. Sir, if you do want to plan for a funeral service, which I hope will be a long long time away, we'd treat you with respect and offer a good..
F	BUSH	What'd everybody say about what happened in town?
M	BUDDY	I don't..
F	BUSH	That crazy old son of a bitch tried to beat a man to death for no reason? That it? Buddy is caught off guard by Bush's lucid candor and finds
M	BUDDY	There's two sides to every story. As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate..
F	BUSH	People say that. But they don't mean it. They think what they think and they don't want to know anything else.
M	BUDDY	Yes, sir, but I think people are so scared of what they don't know that they make things up to feel better about it.
F	BUSH	Like life after dying. Heaven. I hope that part's true, don't you? But I don't think we know the actual truth about much of anything. I know I don't. I'm just guessing most of the time. Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the
M	BUDDY	Lord, that's good..
M	BUS H	You boys been coming out here to throw rocks through my window for 20-30 years.
M	BUDDY	I never..
F	BUSH	Ya'll know lots of stories about me? Yes, sir, I guess, but..
F	BUSH	Tell one.
M	BUDDY	I'd rather not. Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back.
F	BUSH	I rather you did.
M	BUDDY	Well. When I was kid I heard you killed some men in a fist fight.
F	BUSH	Is that all? Bush leans back stone-faced. In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
M	BUS H	What's your name again?
M	BUDDY	Buddy Robinson, sir.
M	BUS H	Well, if I need you -- I know where you are. It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops
M	FRANK (O.S.)	Oh yes Ma'am, I do respect your wishes but you see..
M	FRANK	.state law requires.. No ma'am, we can't bury him under the house.. There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to get it.
M	FRANK (O.S.)	Well just for argument's sake, Ma'am, how would we get the casket under the house? No casket? Would you like to come in, sir? Bush stares suspiciously into the room then back at Buddy.
M	FRANK (O.S.)	But you have to have a container of some kind, Ma'am for decency and uh, sanitation. Bush enters the Funeral Home. As Buddy starts to close the
F	BUSH	Leave it.
M	FRANK	Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of natural things that aren't decent. He did what?! Good God. No, Ma'am, I didn't know that about your husband. Well, yeah now I understand why you want him under the house but still.. The phone goes dead. FRANK sighs as Bush walks in.
M	BUDDY	Frank Quinn, Mr. Bush. Frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself,
M	FRANK	Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee? As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking
F	BUSH	You from anywhere?
M	FRANK	A little bit of everywhere, I guess. Get him a chair, Buddy! Buddy stands behind the waiting chair. Bush scrapes up a different chair. Frank goes behind the Bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit
M	FRANK	How can we help you, sir? Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who
F	BUSH	I'm after a funeral.
M	FRANK	Boy, are you in luck. Follow me.
M	FRANK	Solid pecan, steel handles.. Bush eyes it, repulsed.
M	BUDDY	Mr. Bush is an amazing carpenter.
F	BUSH	Forget the box. What else?
M	FRANK	Whatever you want, flowers..
F	BUSH	No.
M	FRANK	Burial plot..
F	BUSH	Got it.
M	FRANK	A service?
F	BUSH	Party.
M	FRANK	A what?
F	BUSH	A party.
M	BUDDY	What kind of party?
F	BUSH	Funeral party. Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then
M	FRANK	We can do that.
F	BUSH	And I want to be there. Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit..
M	FRANK	You will be, I guarantee it.
F	BUSH	I want to be there now.
M	BUDDY	You want to be at your funeral.. party.. alive? But.. it's not a funeral if you're not, you know, deceased..
M	FRANK	Hold on now, it's a detail, we can look at it.
M	BUDDY	Pretty big detail. Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush.
M	FRANK	So you'd like to have a funeral party while you're alive so you can go?
F	BUSH	Yes or no?
M	FRANK	Yes. Buddy is lost.
M	FRANK	Buddy, get some paper. We need to make of list of who Mr. Bush wants to invite.. As Buddy starts to get up.
F	BUSH	Sit down. Buddy sits right down.
F	BUSH	I want everybody to come who's got a story to tell about me.
M	FRANK	Say again.
M	BUDDY	That probably covers 4 counties.. Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks
F	BUSH	Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the party.
M	FRANK	Well, sir, the thing is, how would you get people to come and tell stories about you that I'm guessing might get them, you know.. shot? Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out. Now all Frank
M	FRANK	You know what, you go ahead, don't worry about it, we'll think of something. A couple of ideas just came to me.
M	BUDDY	Like what? Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and
F	MATTIE	Felix?! Feigning deafness, Bush walks on. Sensing something, Kathryn
F	MATTIE	Felix! Say hello to me! Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix?".
F	BUSH	Hey Mattie. Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together.
F	BUSH	Heard you moved off.
F	MATTIE	I've been back a while. Well.
F	MATTIE	How are you?
F	BUSH	You look like you always did. He abruptly rips himself away and is gone.
M	FRANK	How would she know him?
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	It's none of our business.
M	FRANK	So? We got to know. Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has
M	FRANK	See the size of that thing?
M	BUDDY	What?
M	FRANK	What do you mean, what? Goddamn ball of money! He wants a party with pink balloons on his ears, we're gonna give it to him.
M	BUDDY	But..
M	FRANK	I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever made one December, in Chicago, with wind blowing so hard up my ass I was farting snow flakes in July so don't tell me we can't do this.
M	BUDDY	But..
M	FRANK	That's the last "but" I want to hear out of you. You're a salesman now, sell!
M	FRANK	She called him Felix.
F	MATTIE	A thousand years ago he was the most interesting man I'd ever met.
F	KATHRYN	Get out of here.
F	MATTIE	He was. And I don't mean just the way he looked.
F	KATHRYN	I hope not.
F	MATTIE	Oh no, listen, he was beautiful.
F	KATHRYN	Are you serious? Most people are just laid out nice and simple, you know? You always know what they're thinking and where you are with them. But he was this.. big old cave that went deeper and deeper. You'd never get to the end of him.
F	KATHRYN	Good Lord, you had a crush on him!
F	MATTIE	All the girls did. I know he's something wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble now but there's still nobody like him.
M	FRANK	We have a plan. All we need is a little bit of your time.
F	BUSH	What for?
M	BUDDY	Seeing it is better than hearing about it. Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank.
F	BUSH	How much is it gonna cost? Did you say anything about money? I didn't say anything about money. If we can't get you what you want you don't owe us anything. Buddy is lost in serious thought. Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast.
F	BUSH	It moves, don't it? This is nothing.
F	BUSH	Fancy car for the dead.
M	FRANK	Didn't buy it for them.
M	BUDDY	We say that funerals are "For the Living" but we forget what that means sometimes, I guess. I was thinking about your funeral party before I went to sleep last night and I think I understand it a little now. When I was a kid, my folks where killed in a bad car wreck and the people at the funeral home... they did the impossible as far as I was concerned. I don't know what I would've done without them. And I remember wishing that my mother and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything. Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush
M	FRANK	Where's he going? I wish you wouldn't do that yet. Bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to Mr.
F	BUSH	Don't leave me naked.
M	FRANK	Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs cut you want after we take your picture, I'll pay for it. Mr. Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not.
F	BUSH	Why you want my picture made?
M	BUDDY	That's what we're trying to tell you. We're gonna run an ad in some papers about your party and put up posters of you.
F	BUSH	And you want me to look like this?
M	FRANK	Yes.
F	BUSH	Why?
M	FRANK	Why?
M	BUDDY	It's how people recognize you, sir.
M	FRANK	And you want as many people to come as possible so..
F	BUSH	So a crazy old nutter draws more.
M	FRANK	Basically. Don't you think?
F	BUSH	Do you ever say what you mean? Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor. Buddy snickers. When the Photographer gets back to the
M	FRANK	Take it. I'd go see that. Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him. Damn. You look pretty good.. Bush suddenly gets up and nods at Frank.
F	BUSH	He's paying. As Bush blows out the door, Mr. Tollerude leans against the Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief.
M	FRANK	Son of a bitch, it's almost worth it. What do you think?
M	BUDDY	I wouldn't know you, sir.
F	BUSH	Maybe the Devil won't either. Might work out. Where's the shoes?
M	FRANK	Well, normally people don't wear shoes in a casket so.. .what are you, about a 10D?
M	FRANK	Pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes to the grave. How you set for underwear?
M	BUSH (O.S.)	Don't wear none.
M	FRANK	One question too many.
M	FRANK	I don't mean to be nosey but uh.. how do you know Mattie?
F	BUSH	She's a peach. Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead.
F	BUSH	We had a go. Frank nearly drives off the road.
M	HORTON	"The Lord loves a cheerful giver.."
F	MATTIE	Oh please.. you think the Lord's taking sides in a poker game in a funeral home? Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence.
M	FRANK	If He is, the Divine's cheating.
M	RAY	Exactly.
M	FRANK	Don't agree with me Ray, it makes me doubt myself. Ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails.
M	RAY	I would have turned down your loan if you were my own dear mother, Frank.
M	FRANK	You made my point and don't even know it.
F	MATTIE	Jesus, would you two stop it! You're worse than two old women.. Ray shrugs, sweetly blase. Frank tries to rein in his temper What were you doing with that old bastard in town today, anyway?
M	RAY	Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting him a haircut..on credit. Frank shoots him a look.
M	HORTON	Took out ads in a bunch of papers too, something about a party?
M	FRANK	God, I love small towns.
F	MATTIE	Who are you talking about?
M	RAY	That hermit, what's his name..
M	FRANK	"Felix" Bush.
F	MATTIE	You're giving him a party?
M	FRANK	A funeral party.
F	MATTIE	Whatever you're drinking is not being good to you at all.
M	CARL	What the hell is a funeral party?
M	FRANK	Hey, the man wants to be at his own funeral. What can I say? I'd like to be at my funeral so I could tell my ex-wife to kiss my..
F	MATTIE	What makes you think she'd show up for you?
M	FRANK	Because, Dear, vultures are constitutionally unable to ignore the dead. Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end.
M	HORTON	It's that big wad of money of his you're after. There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide.
M	RAY	What money is that?
F	MATTIE	Felix has money? Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards.
M	HORTON	He came to see me, wanting a funeral, had a big old greasy ball of money. Talked like he thought he could buy his way to heaven with it. How much has he got? Maybe he can. Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
F	MATTIE	Is he sick, Gus? Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it.
M	CARL	I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't nobody gonna go to a funeral for that son of a bitch. Mattie gives Carl a look
M	HORTON	Language..
M	FRANK	They might. He's inviting everyone who has a story about him to come. You could tell about him kicking your ass, Carl. Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.
M	RAY	Old man is going to ride the Weird Train right into the ground, isn't he?
M	FRANK	Wouldn't you like to know what everybody says about you behind your back, Ray? Yeah, probably not.
M	HORTON	I already know way more about people than I need to.
F	MATTIE	Or want to.
M	HORTON	Amen.
M	FRANK	Let's play some cards.
M	RAY	Oh for God's sake, face it Frank, you're broke. This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to
M	RAY	Please. I've won that 4 times already.
M	FRANK	It's who has it last that counts.
M	CARL	Say what you want but if there hadn't been anybody there the other day he would've killed me. And I guarantee you it wouldn't have been his first time. It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie.
F	MATTIE	Everybody knows you started it. Don't look at me like that. I remember when you were born. You were the sweetest little boy. What is wrong with you? Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a
M	CARL	I made a mistake. But there's a line.. and he crossed it.. and everybody knows that too. Ya'll go on and have a party with the devil for his money but I'll dance on his grave someday. Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out.
M	HORTON	it comes to Carl but he's got a point. You don't know what Bush is doing. What if he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun on them?
F	MATTIE	He wouldn't..
M	HORTON	I looked in his eyes. The truth is nobody knows what he's capable of. Maybe even he doesn't know. She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards.
M	RAY	Go ahead and lay your watch down, Frank. But I am going to keep it this time, alright, on principle.
M	FRANK	I got an idea. Let's try something different. The cards in your sock? Leave'em there. Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head.
M	RAY	What are you trying to pull now?
M	FRANK	You really think you're that good that nobody sees?
M	RAY	Sees what?
M	FRANK	You cheat at everything you do. Even at the bank, you loan people just enough to get'em deeper in so you can foreclose on them.
M	RAY	You are a pathetic man. And a goddamn..
M	FRANK	Am I? Then stand up and roll down your socks. Stand up or I'll stand you up. Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is He walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and
M	FRANK	I'll walk you home.
F	MATTIE	No. Thank you. You sure? You're not going to play anymore, are you?
F	MATTIE	Oh, I don't know. Thank you for inviting me though.
M	FRANK	I'm sorry about the..we don't always fight, okay, we do, but he's had that coming for..
F	MATTIE	It's not that. I just..(trails off)
M	FRANK	You came because you don't know what to do with yourself. I slept on the same side of the bed my whole life, right? But after my wife left me, I switched sides, just like that, and never been able to go back.
F	MATTIE	When someone you love is gone, you can pour everything, even a lifetime of things into the place where they were but it's still always empty. He sees that her thoughts are not with him at all but a
F	MATTIE	'Night. He stares after her, wishing that she could see him the way
F	KATHRYN	I didn't hear him wake up.
M	BUDDY	He didn't. Everything's all right, hon.
M	BUDDY	I'm glad you don't know how quick it can change. She gently kisses his arm and the baby's head. Buddy looks at
F	MATTIE	Good Lord. Have you completely lost your mind? Straighten up for heaven's sake before somebody throws a net over you! But she smiles in spite of herself, glances around to see if
M	ANNOUNCER	Friends, we have a treat for you today on WCGM. Our special guest is going to tell us about an event that everyone is talking about. And here he is, Mr. Felix Bush, the mysterious hermit of Caleb County! How are you today, sir?
F	BUSH	I am. Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice.
M	ANNOUNCER	So tell us, sir, exactly how did you come up with the idea of having a funeral party before you die?
F	BUSH	I dreamed it.
M	ANNOUNCER	Really?
F	BUSH	Why would I make that up? Two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet.
M	ANNOUNCER	Okay. Now I have to say that you don't look quite like you do on the posters.
F	BUSH	I got pruned.
M	ANNOUNCER	Well, you're a bit of a local legend, sir. I was a little nervous about our interview. I've heard some pretty wild stories..
F	BUSH	Like what?
M	ANNOUNCER	Well uh, just.. from what I understand, you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it. Is that right?
F	BUSH	You come and tell yours.
M	ANNOUNCER	Thank you. Now how long have you been living out there by yourself?
M	BUSH (O.S.)	40 some years. 40 years with nobody to talk to?
M	BUSH (O.S.)	First 38 are the hardest. Mattie grins.
M	ANNOUNCER	But why would you do that, Mr. Bush, shut yourself off like that? Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear.
F	BUSH	Come to the funeral and maybe you'll find out.
M	ANNOUNCER	You heard it here on WCGM, folks, find out the answer to the mystery February 16..
F	BUSH	One more thing, boy. FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this?
M	BUSH (O.S.)	Gonna be a drawing. What kind of drawing, sir?
F	BUSH	You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day of the funeral we draw names. Then when I die, the winner gets my place, 300 acres of timber that hasn't been touched in 40 years. Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower.
M	ANNOUNCER	For 5 dollars?
F	BUSH	Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home. Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost
M	ANNOUNCER	You heard him! If you want a chance to win 300 acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars, send 5 dollars along with your name and address to.. Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home. As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time I could almost kiss you on the mouth!
M	ANNOUNCER	I'll take a ticket.
M	BUDDY	You're betting on a man dying..
M	ANNOUNCER	I didn't mean it like..
M	FRANK	Hey, it's his idea! They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking
M	FRANK	It's what you want, right? Buy a ticket, son. INSERT PHOTO: The BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN stares at us as we
F	BUSH	Mattie?
F	MATTIE	Felix? Mattie enters, straining to see into the barn. Her eyes
F	MATTIE	Look at you. I wondered if you were still under that beard.
F	BUSH	Wasn't nowhere else to go.
F	MATTIE	I heard you on the radio.
F	BUSH	Well.
F	MATTIE	You've gotten downright chatty.
F	BUSH	I reckon so. This is nice. I drove by a few times after I got back but..
F	BUSH	You want to see it?
F	MATTIE	Do you want me to? Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands
F	BUSH	You always know where you stand with a dog. Want to lay here with them someday if they'll have me.
F	MATTIE	It really is beautiful. Probably looked like this everywhere a hundred years ago.
F	BUSH	You leave things alone, they know what to do.
F	MATTIE	Like you?
F	BUSH	No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do about anything much.
F	MATTIE	You've been alone a long time.
F	BUSH	Some people are more suited to it than others, I reckon.
F	MATTIE	That's funny cause I never thought that it'd suit you. I knew you wouldn't be like anybody else but.. no one to talk to, no one to.. be with.. never. He looks into her then looks away at something.
F	BUSH	How you sleeping these days, girl?
F	MATTIE	How am I what?
F	BUSH	You sleep good?
F	MATTIE	No, not lately. How'd you know? He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back
F	BUSH	Chamomile, it's good when the nights get long. Helps you nod off. She takes it and smiles up at him.
F	BUSH	Want to go on a ways?
F	MATTIE	Yes.
F	BUSH	Would you stay for supper?
F	MATTIE	I don't want to be any trouble.
F	BUSH	A supper guest every 30-40 years is not much trouble, Girl.
F	MATTIE	Alright then. He holds out his arm.
F	BUSH	Better stay close, some big old wild cats been eating my chickens.. She looks around and takes his arm.
F	BUSH	.or maybe it was me.. She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go..
F	MATTIE	You always were good with your hands. He puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down.
F	BUSH	You still play the piano?
F	MATTIE	I teach a few girls.
F	BUSH	I got a good feeling when you played. Remember that time you was playing and the lamp burned out? And you went right on in the dark? I hear that song sometimes at night. She shrugs shyly and sips the tea. Seconds tick by.
F	MATTIE	Sure is quiet out here.
F	BUSH	What?
F	MATTIE	I said it's.. I tried to write you at times but I didn't know what to say.
F	BUSH	Well. I heard you married.
F	MATTIE	He was a Doctor; a real good man. We lived in St. Louis for awhile. He died unexpectedly about a year ago. I came back here because.. I have no idea why.
M	MATTIE (CONT'D)	The list of people who are gone is getting longer and longer and sometimes I feel like all I'm doing is waiting for my name to come up.
F	BUSH	You have a tender heart, always did. She gives him a curious look.
F	BUSH	You can't wait for anything, Mattie. Close your eyes, hold your breath.. stay in one spot your whole life, but you're still moving, like the world's moving under you. There's no waiting.
F	MATTIE	And there's no getting over some things either, is there?
F	BUSH	Reckon not, Little Bit.
F	MATTIE	Little Bit?! Oh my God, nobody's called me that in.. But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured He gets up and stands there staring at the floor.
M	FRANK	Jesus, kid!
M	BUDDY	Yeah! But, but it's not our money. Well yeah, no, but some of it's gonna be! We're putting this thing on! Frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down
M	BUDDY	He should be here. I'm gonna go get him. They lock eyes. Frank finally tosses him the hearse keys.
M	FRANK	I don't know exactly how much your land's worth but looks to me like you could get maybe 10 times that or more. I don't know what to do with it. I mean it's yours to do with what you want but I'm getting a little nervous about it. Never thought I'd see enough money to make me nervous. We should probably talk about the price for everything, the clothes, the ads, the food and drink for the party, the music.. our fee for everything, we'll be fair about that, I'm not worried about it. Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room.
F	BUSH	What do you think, boy? Buddy jerks, looks at Frank, at Bush.
M	BUDDY	Money makes people do funny things. Frank scowls.
M	BUDDY	I think you should probably put it in the bank, sir.
M	FRANK	No! Ray is not.. I mean, if it was my money I'd put it in a bank out of town so everyone didn't know my business. This bank here, you can't trust, that's all I'm saying.
F	BUSH	Can I trust you?
M	FRANK	Every name, every dollar, is right there!
F	BUSH	Not what I asked.
M	FRANK	I've done a hell of a job for you. I don't see why..
M	BUDDY	Mr. Bush, I didn't mean to imply..
F	BUSH	Hush.
M	FRANK	I've sold horses, cars, houses, hell, pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed of it. I don't rob banks, don't cheat at cards, and I sleep all right the nights I sleep. What was the question..?
F	BUSH	They goddamn.. He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the "other" Bush.
F	BUSH	Take out for the expenses you've already had and give me the receipts. As the bills come in for things, give them to me and I'll pay them. Put this money in a box and the boy and I'll take it someplace in the morning. Whatever new comes in, keep it in the bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there 'till I come get it. After the party, name a fair price for what you've done and we'll settle up. I'll be at the car. After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other.
M	FRANK	Is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to be?
M	BUDDY	I don't know who's selling who what anymore.
M	FRANK	It's not clear, is it?
M	BUDDY	Not only that but something feels really wrong.
M	FRANK	Hold on. I told you that you were working on commission..
M	BUDDY	Yeah, but..
M	FRANK	So whatever our end of this is, you get a piece.
M	BUDDY	A piece?
M	FRANK	Half. It could help set you up, Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick,okay? We just have to close it out. From here on, watch me, do what I do, and we'll be fine.
M	BUDDY	But..
M	FRANK	He wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that it's you he trusts. And that's fine because I trust you too. Just don't trust him, okay?
M	BUDDY	I'm lost again.
M	FRANK	Look, that funny feeling you have.. I have it too. And it's not funny. So go along, be friendly, but that's it. There's a euphoria that comes with closing a deal, Buddy, and the bigger the deal, the higher you get. It's better than anything. But the critical time is just before it closes. It's like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart. We're not going to let that happen.
M	BUDDY	All right.
M	FRANK	Now go. You know.. I always wondered why you wanted to work here. I thought you could do a lot better. I didn't know about your folks, I'm really sorry.
M	BUDDY	Thank you. He goes on. Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills,
M	BUDDY	I might have a crying fit coming on too.
F	KATHRYN	Is that right?
M	BUDDY	Feeling a little weepy.
F	KATHRYN	You boys..
M	BUDDY	I can maybe do something really good for us, Katy.
F	KATHRYN	You already have.
M	BUDDY	I mean, money wise.
F	KATHRYN	About Mr. Bush?
M	BUDDY	Yeah. I'm getting half of whatever we make off of him.
F	KATHRYN	So why aren't you happy about it?
M	BUDDY	Didn't know I wasn't. I was happy for a minute. And then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a person's death, I don't know if it's right.
F	KATHRYN	Is it what he wants?
M	BUDDY	He says it is.
F	KATHRYN	You are not responsible for what other people do, Buddy, just you.
M	BUDDY	You're right. You're always right.
F	KATHRYN	At least I am when I'm half naked.
M	BUDDY	Right. Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not
M	BUDDY	Where to, sir?
F	BUSH	North.
M	BUDDY	How far?
F	BUSH	Till I say, son. Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree-
M	BUDDY	How much further now? Bush waves him on. Buddy scowls then decides to get serious
M	FRANK	Hey Mattie. He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in.
M	FRANK	Was that you? It was really..
F	MATTIE	This is a surprise.
M	FRANK	Yeah, sorry. He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here.
F	MATTIE	Was there something you..?
M	FRANK	Uh, yeah.. Help!
F	MATTIE	What?
M	FRANK	I'm up to my ears with this funeral and I thought, you know, we haven't had time to talk much lately so maybe you'd like to come over and rip open envelopes with me and
F	MATTIE	I'm sorry, I have lessons all afternoon. I have to get back in.
M	FRANK	Oh, okay, I just..
F	MATTIE	Sorry. She slips back inside. Frank stares at the door.
F	BUSH	Don't say nothing.
M	BUDDY	To who?
F	BUSH	You can say "hi". Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out. Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door
M	BUDDY	Hi.
M	CHARLIE	Hello. Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances
M	BUDDY	Hi. Charlie holds out his hand, Buddy shakes it.
M	CHARLIE	Are you sure you're in the right place? Not expecting a funeral. Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie squints over
M	CHARLIE	Felix?!
F	BUSH	Hey, Charlie. They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush
F	BUSH	Still standing.
M	CHARLIE	Yes. Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy
M	CHARLIE	Reverend Charlie Jackson.
M	BUDDY	Hi!
F	BUSH	That's Buddy Robinson, he don't talk much.
M	CHARLIE	Someone better talk. A ghost pulls up in the driveway in a hearse, you expect a little bit of a story.
M	CHARLIE	My hearing is not what it was. It sounded like you said you want me to preach at your funeral party with you sitting there?
F	BUSH	Yes, sir.
M	CHARLIE	You know I've talked to God a lot about you over the years and he said he broke the mould when he made you. Said you were sure entertaining to watch but way too much trouble. Buddy grins.
F	BUSH	Well.
M	CHARLIE	What would you want me to say at this funeral?
F	BUSH	Whatever you want to, Charlie. Could you give us a minute? Buddy starts to get up.
F	BUSH	Sit still. Buddy plops back down.
M	CHARLIE	What's the matter? You scared to be alone with me?
F	BUSH	He can hear what's said. Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	All right. After you left here.. did you do the right thing? Felix looks up at the beautifully crafted pulpit.
F	BUSH	I did.. what I thought was right.
M	CHARLIE	You confessed? Asked forgiveness? Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw.
M	CHARLIE	Did you tell her, Felix? Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head.
M	CHARLIE	You came a long way for nothing then. Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot.
F	BUSH	You self-righteous..
M	CHARLIE	Don't you dare..
F	BUSH	I built my own jail and put myself in it! And I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no friends! That's not enough?
M	CHARLIE	You know it isn't.
F	BUSH	Well. Why don't you come and say that then, Charlie? Hell, say it all! I don't care.
M	CHARLIE	Not on your life. The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets
M	CHARLIE	How much do you know about him?
M	BUDDY	Almost nothing, sir. I just work at the funeral home.
M	CHARLIE	Do you know he built this church?
M	BUDDY	No?! How's a man like him make something like this? I mean, I know he's a good carpenter but this is..
M	CHARLIE	Magic? Maybe it's the best of him, maybe he put his soul into it, I don't know.
M	BUDDY	What ya'll were talking about.. what did he do? Who was he supposed to tell? For him and God to know I guess. I wish I'd never been put between them, that's for sure. I will tell you that he showed up here half dead. I had just started preaching. Over the next 4 years we built this.
M	BUDDY	Are you coming to the funeral? Charlie sighs and looks around. 94A Omitted 94A
M	BUDDY	Can I ask you something?
F	BUSH	Do you have to?
M	BUDDY	Yes. What are we doing? Since the day you came into the funeral home, I don't think anything has happened that you didn't want to happen. I just don't know where it's going.
F	BUSH	There's a whole lot of things that you don't know. Like what a dog dreams. You can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you don't know if there's rabbits in there or not. And he can't tell you, can he?
M	BUDDY	Not unless he's a very special dog. They snort together.
F	BUSH	People don't say what they mean either so you don't really know any more about them then you do about that dog's dream.
M	BUDDY	But what..? That time you left my house I saw you stop and look back. You wanted to know what could make somebody like me. Well here you are, son, here you are. Where are you..? Lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go out.
M	BUDDY	I better stop and tell Frank we're back. He's probably had 2 or 3 hissy fits by now. Why don't you stay the night at the house and I'll take you home in the morning? The simple kindness seems to short Bush out. Buddy doesn't
F	BUSH	Well, I... I ain't stayed with nobody in a.. in a long while.
M	BUDDY	It's fine if you want to. Bush looks as if he might say yes but he NOTICES where the
F	BUSH	Let me out.
M	BUDDY	What?
F	BUSH	Stop the car. Bush starts to open the door. Buddy stops abruptly.
M	BUDDY	You can't walk. It's too far.. Bush climbs out with his shotgun.
F	BUSH	Put the money in a casket.
M	BUDDY	You might as well get back in, I'll follow you all the way.
F	BUSH	Get the hell out of here, boy! Buddy's eyes are defiant. Bush slams the door and walks away,
M	BUDDY	Not responsible. Not responsible. Shit. He slams the steering wheel.
M	BUDDY	Frank? Hello? Mr. Bush? He stuffs the money into the casket, grabs the candelabra,
F	BUSH	They keep talking about forgiveness.. ask Jesus for forgiveness.. I never did nothing to Him..
M	FRANK	The cut's not bad but how's the head? He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes.
M	FRANK	Follow it. He looks him over carefully. He's had experience.
M	FRANK	Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? You'll be okay. Did you see who it was?
M	BUDDY	No. I was putting the money in.. heard glass breaking.. locked up the casket quick and.. boom..
M	FRANK	You did good.
M	BUDDY	Doesn't feel good.
F	BUSH	Please, Ma'am.
F	BUSH	Thank you.
F	MATTIE	What are you doing here? Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and
F	BUSH	Can I sit a minute? She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside.
F	BUSH	You want to know why I have your sister's picture on my wall?
F	MATTIE	I'm not stupid, Felix. No, I take that back. How long was it going on? She was already married when I met you. Were you just making up to me to get to her? Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle.
F	MATTIE	If you're not going to talk, leave.
F	BUSH	Can you help who you love? Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that
F	BUSH	I've had 40 years to think about it and I still don't know.
F	MATTIE	I don't know either, so.. Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her.
F	BUSH	I want to tell you how it was. If you don't want me to, I'll go. Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around
F	MATTIE	Don't lie to me. When did you take up with her?
F	BUSH	I came to see you and she was there, hanging clothes on the line with your mama. Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what
F	BUSH	She turned around.. .and.. I promise you that I did not know that I had a heart till right then. Tears well up in Mattie's eyes.
F	BUSH	You were a fine fine girl. I didn't know why you wanted anything to do with me but I was gonna keep coming to see you 'till my luck ran out. And then I saw her.
F	MATTIE	She was married! And she wasn't just my sister, she was my best friend. We told each other everything. I can't.. how long did it go on?! Bush's face is so white it looks like a death mask.
F	MATTIE	How long?
F	BUSH	It's still going on, Little Bit. Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it
F	MATTIE	Did you have anything to do with her death? The mug trembles. She sees it.
F	MATTIE	Tell me. Like a fish jerked from the water, he mouth opens and closes, Felix! Get out of my house! NOW! Bush stands up quickly and starts for the door.
F	MATTIE	And go to hell!
F	BUSH	Been there. He staggers, tries to catch himself but slides down against Despite her anger, Mattie starts toward him.
F	MATTIE	You need to see a doctor.. He raises his eyes to her but says nothing. They look into
F	MATTIE	Just tell me, Felix. Did you hurt Mary or not? Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his Bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun.
M	FRANK	What the hell?! Bush glances at the pistol, at the open drawers of the
F	BUSH	They get it?
M	FRANK	No. Buddy sealed it up in a casket. Took a crack on the head, but..
F	BUSH	Is he all right?
M	FRANK	Yeah.
F	BUSH	You sure?
M	FRANK	I was an army medic. He'll be fine. But Bush is still dark.
M	FRANK	But you ought to take those clothes back and get something in your size.
F	BUSH	They get the whiskey?
M	FRANK	Brought the money back, huh? Listen, I've been thinking.. What if we had the party at your place? People are going to want to see the land they're getting so..
F	BUSH	Don't know.
M	FRANK	Well, think about it, we could..
F	BUSH	Don't know that I'm doing it.
M	FRANK	What?!
F	BUSH	Thinking to call it off.
M	FRANK	You can't!
F	BUSH	Damn well can if I want to.
M	FRANK	No no no, it's in motion!
F	BUSH	If I say no, it's no. Send the money back.
M	FRANK	You're killing me! I bought things, hired people.. promised money, everybody in town is hoping to..
F	BUSH	I care about this town as much as they care about me.
M	FRANK	It's what you said you wanted and I've busted my ass for you. So why don't you want it anymore? You owe me that. It was the end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail party. But I guess I ain't got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and I can't get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it. And to hell with me.
F	KATHRYN	Are you having trouble seeing?
M	BUDDY	I see you're mad.
F	KATHRYN	I'm not mad. I'm concerned She shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him. No, you're mad. She tenderly touches his head.
F	KATHRYN	If I could get my hands on whoever did this, you'd see mad.
M	FRANK (O.S.)	Buddy! You up?! Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a
M	FRANK	Trouble.
M	BUDDY	What's the matter?
M	FRANK	Bush is pulling out.
M	BUDDY	What?
M	FRANK	What happened yesterday?
M	BUDDY	I told you, we went up to Illinois and met a preacher.
M	FRANK	But what happened?
M	BUDDY	He asked the preacher to come to the funeral. He said no.
M	FRANK	Son of a bitch, that's got to be.. Sorry. Sorry. Where's the preacher?
M	BUDDY	It won't do you any good.
M	FRANK	Why not?
M	BUDDY	He knows something about Bush, something bad, I think.
M	FRANK	What is it?
M	BUDDY	Wouldn't say but..
M	FRANK	Well if Bush wants him, by God, Bush is gonna get him.
F	KATHRYN	You want eggs, Frank, or will the skillet do?
M	FRANK	What? What's wrong?
F	KATHRYN	What's wrong? My husband has his head bashed in and all you care about is this party!
M	FRANK	It's not like that, Katie, this is for all of us. You're like.. family to me.. I..
F	KATHRYN	This is not how family acts!
M	FRANK	Well, I'm sorry. I've never had any practice. You okay? Buddy nods. Frank leaves. Buddy mutters to the baby..
M	BUDDY	Stay out of her way today, partner.
F	MATTIE	Fool, it's too late for bulbs.. Suddenly she hurls the trowel as far as she can, then a
F	MATTIE	.too goddamn late..
M	FRANK	Reverend Jackson? Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home.
M	CHARLIE	How'd you find me? Frank just smiles, takes off his hat, and offers his hand. Frank enters, noting the clean simple home of man with an
M	CHARLIE	I was going to play some dominos this afternoon. But something told me to stay home. I should have played dominos. Is he out there?
M	FRANK	Bush? No, sir.
M	CHARLIE	You sure?
M	FRANK	Pretty sure.
M	CHARLIE	Did you check the back? Frank snorts, liking Charlie immediately.
M	FRANK	You told Bush that you wouldn't come to the funeral?
M	CHARLIE	If he got that, why are you here?
M	FRANK	To help you rethink it.
M	CHARLIE	I don't need any help.
M	FRANK	Have you rethought it? So there is a need. First off, Bush doesn't know I'm here.
M	CHARLIE	I wouldn't be so sure about that. He's got a way of making people do what he wants them to. Frank squirms, knows it true.
M	CHARLIE	Is he really a hermit? Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat.
M	FRANK	He came to see me after he'd been here, wants to call the party off.
M	CHARLIE	I don't care.
M	FRANK	Said he'd meant it to be a.. end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail funeral but that he didn't have the guts to open his mouth and he couldn't get anybody to talk for him. You know anything about that part? At first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him. But he didn't want to hear their bullshit stories, did he? Pardon my language. He wants to tell one, doesn't he?
M	CHARLIE	About time.
M	FRANKFRANK	Whatever he did, it's been locked up in him for 40 years and he can't get it out. I think he told you. You may be the only person he told. And now he wants you to tell it for him.
M	CHARLIE	Because he won't.
M	FRANK	Or can't.
M	CHARLIE	Or won't.
M	FRANK	Or can't. At least he wants the truth to come out, give him that. I'll think about it.
M	FRANK	Is there a boarding house around here?
M	CHARLIE	I said I'd think.
M	FRANK	Yeah but if you're not coming, I'm not going back. I made promises I can't keep to people I care about. This falls apart they won't blame Bush. Bank will take my business.. If I'm gonna have to start over again, might as well be from here. Charlie scowls at him.
M	BUDDY	What are you doing, sir?
F	BUSH	Getting a suntan. Bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder.
M	BUDDY	Are you stuck?
F	BUSH	You have no goddamn idea how right you are, son. Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off.
F	BUSH	I'll sit here a minute. Bush looks at the butterfly bandage on Buddy's head.
F	BUSH	We're a pair, ain't we?
M	BUDDY	Are you sick?
F	BUSH	Just going through the motions.
M	BUDDY	What does that mean?
F	BUSH	There's Alive and there's Dead. And there's a worst place in between them that I hope you never know nothing about. Do you know who hurt you?
M	BUDDY	No, sir.
F	BUSH	Sonsabitches.
M	BUDDY	It doesn't matter. Listen. Frank went somewhere and the raffle money is gone.
F	BUSH	You figure he took off with it?
M	BUDDY	I don't know. I don't want to think that. But the money's not here and I don't know where it is. He said he'd call and he never did. Buddy glances into the shadows and sees the casket looming on
F	BUSH	Well.. what do you want to do? Buddy looks back at Bush.
M	BUDDY	I don't.. I want to make this funeral for you if you want it.
F	BUSH	Hell. Do it if you can. I guess for everyone like me, there's one like you, son. I about forgot that. Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush forces
M	BUDDY	I'm glad you decided to come, sir.
M	CHARLIE	Free will is not all that it's cracked up to be. Did you take the money out of the casket?
M	FRANK	Yeah.
M	BUDDY	Why didn't you tell me?!
M	FRANK	I forgot.
M	BUDDY	You forgot?! Where is it?
M	FRANK	In the hearse, under the floorboards. Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and
M	FRANK	What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now all we got to do is take the Reverend here to Bush and..
M	BUDDY	I forgot to tell you, Mr. Bush already said he would do it.
M	FRANK	You're shittin' me?! Charlie gets up and starts walking away..
M	CHARLIE	Where can I catch a train?
M	FRANK	You can't leave you just got here.
M	CHARLIE	Watch and learn.
M	FRANK	Hold on..
M	CHARLIE	Where's the station? The hearse pulls in and parks. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie Trucks and cars are parked everywhere around the big
M	CHARLIE	Expecting a crowd? Frank and Buddy give each other a look.
M	FRANK	Honestly? We don't have a clue about what's going to happen here. The big old honking generator is unloaded. Holes are dug. 10
M	CHARLIE	Pretty nice jail. Charlie enters and looks around the little room.
F	BUSH	Why did you change your mind? Charlie just looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any
F	BUSH	Thank you.
M	CHARLIE	How do you want to do this?
F	BUSH	I don't. He gets a haunted look that catches Charlie off guard.
F	BUSH	I'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie, I really am. But if I can't get it done, would you do it? I want it said. Please, sir. Charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door.
F	BUSH	Tell'em the box is in the barn. Carl tucks an old 45 in the back of his pants. Gary and Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd.
F	BUSH	You asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch, now what are you gonna do?
M	GARY	Hey, hey, where you going? He said the woods..
M	CARL	Closer. And he takes off.
M	THEMAN	He's crazy! Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage. Buddy peels away. Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage.
M	FRANK	gentlemen. I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home. Welcome to the live funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush! People don't know whether to clap or not. Some do and the Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby.
M	BUDDY	Where's Mattie?
F	KATHRYN	She wouldn't come. I don't..
M	FRANK	I've done some things in my life, but never this. Bet you haven't either, bet no one has.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	We try to make things predictable and safe but if we don't risk everything to get what we want, we don't want it enough.
M	FRANK	The person who made all of this happen for us doesn't like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I'm proud to know him. Buddy is embarrassed and moved. Kathryn's eyes soften.
F	BUSH	Sonsabitches. Carl drops his can. The other men drop their cans but Gary
F	BUSH	Go on, I'll paint the porch with his head.
M	CARL	Don't do it! Gary drops the pistol.
F	BUSH	Now pick up them cans and keep pouring.
M	CARL	What?
F	BUSH	You heard me. The men cautiously pick up the cans..
F	BUSH	Pour it on your head. All of it. The men look at each other. Bush cocks the other barrel of
M	THEMAN	I won't!
F	BUSH	Pour it or die, I don't care which. The men hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over
F	BUSH	I got two barrels, anybody else wants to rabbit, now's the time.
M	FRANK	I know many of you have heard stories about Mr. Bush. But today I've been told that we're going to hear another kind of story, his. A murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they see.. Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton see Bush. Quinn and Charlie follow the crowd's eyes to Bush.
M	QUINN	Holy Mother of.. SHERIFF DEPUTIES beside the stage see Bush. Buddy starts toward Bush. Kathryn tries to stop him but he A shot rings out! Carl and Gary hit the ground like dead men. The crowd hunkers and scatters. Horton steps in front of Kathryn and the baby. Buddy freezes. Bush whirls and sees.. .Carl's old 45 still smoking. The gun is in Tom's small shaking hands..
M	CARL	Don't hurt him! It's my fault. Bush cracks his shotgun, walks slowly to the boy, gently
F	BUSH	A second chance is a precious thing, son. Don't waste it. The boy plops down, overwhelmed. And suddenly everyone is in motion. The Deputies run toward Bush. Frank and Charlie rush from the Buddy arrives at Bush first and sees the blood weeping onto
M	BUDDY	Are you alright, sir?! Without turning Bush glances at the Deputies.
F	BUSH	Tried to burn me out. Let the boy be, he didn't mean nothing. As the Deputies get a hold of Carl and Gary, Frank, Charlie,
M	CARL	Help him, Gus, please.. Horton goes to the trembling boy and picks him up.
M	ANNOUNCER	Folks, I've just received word of a tragic turn of events at the Bush Funeral Party. It seems that Mr. Bush has been shot. I repeat, Mr. Felix Bush has been shot. There is no word of condition..
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	When I know more I will let you know. I'm sure he would appreciate your prayers..
F	BUSH	Close the door. Charlie slams the door. Frank examines the wound. Buddy
M	FRANK	Missed the bone. Got any alcohol and clean rags? Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment
M	BUDDY	Why don't you sit down, sir?
F	BUSH	Boil some water and I'll tell you how to make me a poultice. Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie
M	FRANK	This is gonna hurt.
F	BUSH	Don't sugar coat it.
M	REVEREND HORTON	Lord, you say you move in mysterious ways and we believe you because we don't understand much of anything. And so we come to you today not seeking answers to what's happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to each other and find some forgiveness and understanding.
M	BUS H	Pretty good prayer. Mighta been wrong about that preacher.
M	CHARLIE	Why don't you lay down, Felix? Bush thinks about it, sees a way out. For a second he looks
F	BUSH	Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve.
M	BUDDY	Are you sure? Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush
F	BUSH	You ain't nervous? All them white folks out there?
M	CHARLIE	There's white folks here?!
F	BUSH	Stick with me, you'll be all right.
M	CHARLIE	You're the one they're shooting at. As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings
F	BUSH	Pretty interesting day so far, huh boy? Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door. Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone
M	CHARLIE	I'm Reverend Charlie Jackson. Felix wants to continue with his funeral. And he's asked me to say a few words. Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn.
M	CHARLIE	We like to imagine that good and bad, right and wrong, are miles apart. But the truth is, very often they're.. and laces his fingers .all tangled up with each other. Bush raises his head and looks at Charlie's back.
M	CHARLIE	Some 40 years ago Felix Bush dropped into my life and then dropped out. In between he built the most beautiful sanctuary that I've ever seen. A lot of wonderful things happened in that church. Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts
F	BUSH	Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
F	BUSH	Had to go clear to Illinois to find somebody that had anything good to say about me. Hell of a thing. His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
F	BUSH	I'm not a smart man or a wise one. I don't know what kind of man I am. I was always restless, thought I'd see the world. But I didn't hardly go nowhere.. on purpose.. Because.. because I did something that I was ashamed of. Something I couldn't ever fix. Ya'll probably think you know what you'd do or what you wouldn't. And I wish you good luck with that. I really do. When I told Charlie what I'd done, he told me to confess to God and the law and to.. to someone else.. so I could get forgiveness. But I didn't want forgiveness. I needed to hold on to what I did.. to be sick from it every day of my life. So I never told nobody else. He stops, not knowing how to go on. The crowd has quieted As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he Mattie's here. Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face
F	BUSH	I fell in love with a married lady. And somehow she fell in love with me. It was the only time that I have been in love. We made a plan to run off and start a new life but she didn't show up at the time that we said we'd meet. I got a funny feeling and I went to her house. Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking
F	BUSH	Her husband answered the door. He had blood on him. For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being
F	BUSH	I hit him pretty hard, knocked him down. Can't remember going upstairs but I remember I saw a hammer on the steps and it had blood and hair on it. The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.
F	BUSH	I found her in the bedroom. She was crawling across the floor. But before I could get to her and help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit the wall. And then her husband jumped on my back. Funny what happens sometimes when things go wrong. It's like the clock stops and you have all the time in the world to think. I could see that her husband had set the downstairs on fire before he came up.
M	BUSH (CONT'D)	And as I was slamming his head into the wall, trying to get shed of him, I could see clear as anything that it was all my fault. If I'd just never spoke to her.. And as I was thinking about that, I saw that the lamp he threw had set the room we were in on fire too. Bush forces himself to keep looking into Mattie.
F	BUSH	And then I realized that I was on fire. I tried to put myself out but I couldn't, everything was.. I dropped him, turned around and saw her lying on the floor and called her name. She looked up at me.. .and the next thing I knew, I was flying.. A loud roar of fire and crushing timbers.. With his clothes still smoking, he unbelievably tries to run Bush and Mattie are looking into each other, one anguished
F	BUSH	I don't know how I got out the window.
M	BUSH (CONT'D)	No matter how many times I play it in my mind, I can't remember jumping. I thought I killed him, but maybe he pushed me, I don't know... I swear to you, if I left her in there.. everything I know about myself is a lie. But that don't matter. I didn't get her out, Little Bit, I didn't. I'm sorry.
F	MATTIE	Oh, Felix.. He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it.
F	BUSH	Wonder if her hair would be white? Mule is lead back to the barn. The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck. Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down
M	BUDDY	How you doing, sir?
F	BUSH	Just fair, son.
M	HORTON	Carl said Ray paid them to set the fire. Paid them to break into the funeral home too.
M	FRANK	Can't stop pulling Aces out of his ass, can he?
M	HORTON	Spend his money on lawyers now. You know how thrifty they are. Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is still
F	BUSH	What's his name?
M	BUDDY	Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir.
F	BUSH	He ain't gonna throw rocks at me, is he?
M	BUDDY	Not if knows what's good for him.
F	BUSH	You boys did good. Real good. Let's settle up.
M	BUDDY	We don't have to do that now. You get some rest.
M	FRANK	Yeah. We'll come out tomorrow.
F	BUSH	Bring my shirt back, I just got it broke in. Bush pulls Buddy aside. Frank stares over at them but can't
M	FRANK	Are you alright, Mattie? She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening.
F	MATTIE	Oh, I don't know. I'm still moving, I guess.. He doesn't know what that means but she has finally really Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush
F	BUSH	Thanks again for coming, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	I'm proud of you. Thank you for my church.
F	BUSH	Did you ever get my bill?
M	HORTON	Can we get a ride our car's about 2 miles down the road. Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out Look at that. My funeral and everybody's in there but me. The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away. The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
M	CHARLIE	Well, Felix, this one's for real, I guess. I didn't actually see them put you in the box so.. Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the
M	CHARLIE	Wherever you are, you're probably giving someone a hard time or something wonderful and priceless just to confuse them. Not everything can be figured out, nor everybody. I wish you peace from the burdens of your mind and heart. I wish it for us all. Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand
M	BUDDY	A 50 on the outside, all ones inside. Less than $100.
M	FRANK	What?!
M	CHARLIE	I told you. Nobody listens to the preacher. Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.
M	BUDDY	The day of the party he told me about the will he had in the secret drawer of his table. He left the raffle money to all of us. Everyone is shocked, touched. But you have to pay for Mule's upkeep for the rest of his life. Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.
M	BUDDY	And he set up a fund for the upkeep of your church.
M	CHARLIE	What's the catch?
M	BUDDY	No catch, sir.
M	CHARLIE	Still don't get it, do you? With Felix, there's always a catch.
M	BUDDY	Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy wondering what it was. They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
