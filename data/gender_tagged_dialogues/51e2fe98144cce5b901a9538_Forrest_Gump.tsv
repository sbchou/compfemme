M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	FORREST	Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.
M	FORREST	You want a chocolate?
M	FORREST	I could eat about a million and a half of these. My momma always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."
M	FORREST	Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that.
M	BLACK WOMAN	My feet hurt.
M	FORREST	Momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been.
M	FORREST	I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.
M	FORREST	Momma said they'd take my anywhere.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She said they was my magic shoes.
M	DOCTOR	All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around.
M	DOCTOR	How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've ever seen. But his back is as crooked as a politician.
M	DOCTOR	But we're gonna straighten him right up now, won't we, Forrest?
F	MRS. GUMP	Forrest!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, when I was a baby, Momma named me after the great Civil War hero, General Nathan Bedford Forrest...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She said we was related to him in some way. And, what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name. Forrest Gump.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Momma said that the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense.
F	MRS. GUMP	Just wait, let me get it.
F	MRS. GUMP	Let me get it. Wait, get it this way. Hold on.
F	MRS. GUMP	All right.
F	MRS. GUMP	Oooh. All right. What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?
F	MRS. GUMP	Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs. Momma always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	We lived about a quarter mile of Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Momma's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago. Something like that.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Since it was just me and Momma and we had all these empty rooms, Momma decided to let those rooms out. Mostly to people passing through. Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like that. That's how me and Mommy got money. Mommy was a real smart lady.
F	MRS. GUMP	Remember what I told you, Forrest. You're no different than anybody else is.
F	MRS. GUMP	Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else. You are no different.
M	PRINCIPAL	Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.
F	MRS. GUMP	Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all.
M	PRINCIPAL	I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now, this is normal.
M	PRINCIPAL	Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go to a special school. Now, he'll be just fine.
F	MRS. GUMP	What does normal mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else. He's not going to some special school to learn to how to re-tread tires. We're talking about five little points here. There must be something can be done.
M	PRINCIPAL	We're a progressive school system. We don't want to see anybody left behind.
M	PRINCIPAL	Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?
F	MRS. GUMP	He's on vacation.
M	PRINCIPAL	Well, your momma sure does care about your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.
M	PRINCIPAL	You don't say much, do you?
F	MRS. GUMP	Finally, he had to try it. It looked easy, but, oh, what happened. First there...
M	FORREST	Momma, what's vacation mean?
F	MRS. GUMP	Vacation?
M	FORREST	Where Daddy went?
F	MRS. GUMP	Vacation's when you go somewhere, and you don't ever come back. Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty. There was always folks comin' and goin'.
M	MRS. GUMP (V.O.)	Suppa.
F	MRS. GUMP	It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...
M	MAN WITH CANE	My, my. That sure looks special.
F	MRS. GUMP	Gentlemen, would you care to join us for supper? Hurry up and get it before the flies do. I prefer you don't smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Sometimes we had so many people stayin' with us that every room was filled with travelers. You know, folks livin' out of their suitcases, and hat cases, and sample cases.
F	MRS. GUMP	Well, you go ahead and start. I can't find Forrest.
F	MRS. GUMP	Forrest... Forrest... One time a young man was staying with us, and he had him a guitar case.
M	ELVIS PRESLEY	"Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine."
F	MRS. GUMP	Forrest! I told you not to bother this nice young man.
M	ELVIS	Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I was just showin' him a thing or two on the guitar here.
F	MRS. GUMP	All right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat.
M	ELVIS	Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.
M	ELVIS	Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there. Slow it down some.
M	ELVIS	"You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound dog..."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I liked that guitar.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	It sounded good.
M	ELVIS	"...cryin' all the time"
M	ELVIS	"You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I started moving around to the music, swinging my hips. This one night me and Momma...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...was out shoppin', and we walked right by Benson's Furniture and Appliance store, and guess what.
M	ELVIS	You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
M	ELVIS	You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
F	MRS. GUMP	This is not children's eyes.
M	ELVIS	"Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Some years later, that handsome young man who they called "The King," well, he sung too many songs, had himself a heart attack or something.
M	FORREST	Must be hard being a king. You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't.
F	MRS. GUMP	You do your very best now, Forrest.
M	FORREST	I sure will, Momma.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well.
M	BUS DRIVER	Are you comin' along?
M	FORREST	Momma said not to be taking rides from strangers.
M	BUS DRIVER	This is the bus to school.
M	FORREST	I'm Forrest Gump.
M	BUS DRIVER	I'm Dorothy Harris.
M	FORREST	Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.
M	BOY #1	This seat's taken.
M	BOY #2	It's taken!
M	BOY #3	You can't sit here. You know, it's funny what a young man recollects. 'Cause I don't remember being born.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I, I... don't recall what I got for my first Christmas and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic. But, I do remember the first time I heard the sweetiest voice... ...in the wide world.
M	GIRL	You can sit here if you want.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life. She was like an angel.
F	JENNY	Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't ya?
F	JENNY	What's wrong with your legs?
M	FORREST	Um, nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy. I just sat next to her on that bus and had conversation all the way to school.
F	JENNY	Then why do you have those shoes on?
M	FORREST	My momma said my back's crooked like a question mark. These are going to make me as straight as an arrow. They're my magic shoes.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And next to Momma, no one ever talked to me or asked me questions.
F	JENNY	Are you stupid or something.
M	FORREST	Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.
F	JENNY	I'm Jenny.
M	FORREST	I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	From that day on, we was always together. Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She taught me how to climb...
F	JENNY	Come on, Forrest, you can do it.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...I showed her how to dangle.
M	FORREST	"...a good little monkey and..."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She helped me to learn how to read.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And I showed her to swing.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait for the stars.
M	FORREST	Momma's gonna worry about me.
F	JENNY	Just stay a little longer.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home.
M	FORREST	Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She was my most special friend.
M	FORREST	My only friend.
M	FORREST	Now, my Momma always told me that miracles happen every day. Some people don't think so, but they do.
M	BOY #1	Hey... dummy!
M	BOY #2	Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?
M	BOY #3	Look, I'm Forrest Gump.
F	JENNY	Just run away, Forrest.
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest!
F	JENNY	Run away! Hurry!
M	BOY #2	Get the bikes!
M	BOY #3	Hurry up!
M	BOY #3	Let's get him! Come on!
M	BOY #2	Look out, dummy, here we come!
M	BOY #2	We're gonna get you!
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest! Run!
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest!
M	BOY #1	Come back here, you!
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest! Run!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you.
M	FORREST	But I can run like the wind blows.
M	FORREST	From that day on, if I was going somewhere, I was running!
M	BOY #2	He's gettin' away! Stop him!
M	OLD CRONY	That boy sure is a running fool.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed to want to go home? Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma had gone up to heaven when she was five and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.
M	FORREST	Jenny? Jenny?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	He was a very lovin' man. He was always kissing and touchin' her and her sisters. And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.
M	FORREST	Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?
F	JENNY	Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.
M	JENNY'S DAD	Jenny!
F	JENNY	Come on!
M	JENNY'S DAD	Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd better come back here, girl!
M	JENNY'S DAD	Where you at?
M	JENNY'S DAD	Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!
F	JENNY	Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.
M	JENNY'S DAD	Jenny!
F	JENNY	Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here. Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Momma always said that God is mysterious.
M	JENNY'S DAD	Jenny! Get back here! He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day. Instead... ...he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more. She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy 'cause she was so close.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and come over to my house, just 'cause she said she was scared. Scared of what, I don't know...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...but I think it was her grandma's dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends... ...all the way to high school.
M	OLDER BOY #1	Hey, stupid!
F	JENNY	Quit it!
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest, run!
M	OLDER BOY #1	Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest!
M	OLDER BOY #2	Come on, he's getting away! Move it!
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest! Run!
M	OLDER BOY #1	You better be runnin', stupid.
M	OLDER BOY #2	Come on, dummy!
M	OLDER BOY #1	Haul ass, dummy!
M	OLDER BOY #1	Yeah, you better be runnin'!
M	BOY	Ya-hoo!
M	OLDER BOY #1	Move it, jack rabbit!
M	OLDER BOY #1	Come on!
M	BOY	Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on, Forrest! Yeah!
F	JENNY	Run, Forrest!
M	FORREST	Now, it used to be, I ran to get where I was goin'. I never thought it would take me anywhere.
M	OLDER BOY	Come on. Whoo-hoo!
M	FOOTBALL COACH	Who in the hell is that?
M	HIGH SCHOOL COACH	That there is Forrest Gump. Coach. Just a local idiot. And can you believe it? I got to go to college, too.
M	FOOTBALL COACH	Okay! Run!
M	FOOTBALL COACH	Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!
M	FOOTBALL COACH	You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go! Run!
M	FOOTBALL COACH	Run! Turn! Go!
M	FOOTBALL COACH	He must be the stupidest son-of-a- bitch alive. But he sure is fast! Now, maybe it was just me but college was very confusing times.
M	CHET HUNTLEY	Federal troops enforcing a court order integrated the University of Alabama today.
M	CHET HUNTLEY	Governor George Wallace had carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the schoolhouse door.
M	GOVERNOR WALLACE	We hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the central government.
M	KATZENBACH	Governor Wallace, I take it from that, uh...
M	KATZENBACH	...statement that you are going to stand in that door, and that you are not going to carry out the orders of this court, and that you are going to resist us from doing so. I would ask you once again to responsibility step aside and if you do not, I'm going to assure you...
M	FORREST	Earl, what's going on?
M	EARL	Coons are tryin' to get into school.
M	FORREST	Coons? When raccoons try to get on our back porch, Momma just chase 'em off with a broom.
M	EARL	Not raccoons, you idiot, niggas. And they want to go to school with us.
M	FORREST	With us? They do?
M	NEWSMAN	...block the doorway, President Kennedy ordered the Secretary of Defense then to use the military force.
M	NEWSMAN	Here by videotape is the encounter by General Graham, Commander of the National Guard, and Governor Wallace.
M	GOVERNOR WALLACE	We must have no violence today, or any other day, because these National Guardsmen are here today as Federal Soldiers for Alabamans. And they live within our borders and they are all our brothers. We are winning in this fight because we are awakening the American people to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times, just so evident today, the trend toward military dictatorship in this country.
M	NEWSMAN	And so at day's end the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone had been signed up for summer classes.
M	FORREST	Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.
M	CHET HUNTLEY	Governor Wallace did what he promised to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob from gathering and prevented violence.
M	ASSISTANT COACH	Say, wasn't that Gump?
M	CHET HUNTLEY	NBC News will present a special program on the Alabama integration story at 7:30 p.m. tonight...
M	ASSISTANT COACH	Naw, that couldn't be.
M	FOOTBALL COACH	It sure as hell was.
M	CHET HUNTLEY	...standard Eastern Daylight Time. Now a word from Anacin.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	A few years later, that angry little man at the schoolhouse door thought it would be a good idea, and ran for President.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	But, somebody thought that it wasn't.
M	FORREST	But he didn't die.
M	BLACK WOMAN	My bus is here.
M	FORREST	Is it the number 9?
M	BLACK WOMAN	No, it's the number 4.
M	FORREST	It was nice talkin' to you.
M	WHITE WOMAN	I remember when that happened, when Wallace got shot. I was in college.
M	FORREST	Did you go to a girls' college, or to a girls' and boys' together college?
M	WHITE WOMAN	It was co-ed.
M	FORREST	'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	But, I'd go and visit her every chance I got.
F	JENNY	Ouch! That hurts.
F	JENNY	Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
M	BILLY	Jesus!
F	JENNY	What are you doing?
M	FORREST	He was hurtin' you.
M	BILLY	What the hell is going on here?
F	JENNY	No, he's not!
M	BILLY	Who is that? Who is that?
F	JENNY	Get over there!
F	JENNY	Billy, I'm sorry.
M	BILLY	What in the hell, git, would you git away from me!
F	JENNY	Don't... Wait a second!
M	BILLY	Git, just git away from me!
F	JENNY	Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
F	JENNY	He doesn't know any better!
F	JENNY	Forrest, why'd you do that?
M	FORREST	I brought you some chocolates. I'm sorry. I'll go back to my college now.
F	JENNY	Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come on.
M	FORREST	Is this your room?
F	JENNY	Shh!
F	JENNY	Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're gonna be?
M	FORREST	Who I'm gonna be?
F	JENNY	Yeah.
M	FORREST	Aren't I going to be me?
F	JENNY	Well, you'll always be you, just another kind of you. You know? I want to be famous.
F	JENNY	I want to be a singer like Joan Baez. I just want to be an empty stage with my guitar, my voice... just me.
F	JENNY	And I want to reach people on a personal level. I want to be able to say things, just one-to-one.
F	JENNY	Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?
M	FORREST	I sit next to them in my home economics class all the time.
M	DJ	You're listening to WHHY in Birmingham, the clear A.M. voice of Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...
M	DJ	...coming to you on a night that is anything but clear. The weatherman says that rain's gonna fall all night long so stay with us, get warm, get cozy, get under the covers to the cool sounds of WHHY.
M	FORREST	Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.
F	JENNY	It's okay.
M	DJ	...444-6789, with ya till sunrise, playing the music you want to hear when you want to hear it. If you have a request or dedication, give us a call. We guarantee you'll hear your requests within one hour.
F	JENNY	It's all right.
M	DJ	Candy is on the line tonight. Candy's answering the phones, give Candy your request, your dedication, and ask her why she won't go out with me, would you? Here's more music.
F	JENNY	It's okay.
M	FORREST	Oh, I'm dizzy.
F	JENNY	I bet that never happened in home ec.
M	FORREST	No.
M	FORREST	I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.
F	JENNY	I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.
M	CROWD	Run! Run! Run!
M	CROWD	Run! Run! Run!
M	CROWD	Stop!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	College ran by real fast 'cause I played so much football.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	They even put me on a thing called the All-America Team where you get to meet the President of the United States.
M	ANNOUNCER	President Kennedy met with the Collegiate All-American Football Team at the Oval Office today.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, the real good thing about meeting the President of the United States is the food.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	They put you in this little room with just about anything you'd want to eat or drink. And since number one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...and number two, they was free, I musta drank me about fifteen Dr. Peppers.
M	PRESIDENT KENNEDY	Congratulations. How does it feel to be an All-American?
M	1ST PLAYER	It's an honor, Sir.
M	PRESIDENT KENNEDY	Congratulations. How does it feel to be an All-American?
M	2ND PLAYER	Very good, Sir.
M	PRESIDENT KENNEDY	Congratulations. How does it feel to be an All-American?
M	3RD PLAYER	Very good, Sir.
M	PRESIDENT KENNEDY	Congratulations. How do you feel?
M	FORREST	I gotta pee.
M	PRESIDENT KENNEDY	I believe he said he had to go pee. Sometime later, for no particular reason, somebody shot that nice young President when he was ridin' in his car.
M	FORREST	And a few years after that... ...somebody shot his little brother, too, only he was in a hotel kitchen.
M	FORREST	It must be hard being brothers. I wouldn't know.
M	DEAN	Forrest Gump. Now can you believe it? After only five years of playing football, I got a college degree.
M	DEAN	Congratulations, son.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Momma was proud.
F	MRS. GUMP	Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, I'll hold this for you.
M	MILITARY RECRUITER	Congratulations, son. Have you given any thought to your future?
M	FORREST	Thought?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Hello, I'm Forrest...
M	FORREST	...Forrest Gump.
M	ARMY BUS DRIVER	Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you are, fuzzball! You're not even a lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get your faggoty ass on the bus. You're in the Army now!
M	RECRUIT #1	This seat's taken.
M	RECRUIT #2	It's taken.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	At first, it seemed like I made a mistake.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...seeing how it was my induction day and I was already gettin' yelled at.
F	BUBBA	You can sit down... if you want to. I didn't know who I might meet or what they might ask.
F	BUBBA	You ever been on a real shrimp boat?
M	FORREST	No, but I been on a real big boat.
F	BUBBA	I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin' boat. I've been workin' on shrimp boats all my life. I started out my uncle's boat, that's my mother's brother, when I was about maybe nine. I was just lookin' into buyin' a boat of my own and got drafted. My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
F	BUBBA	People call me Bubba. Just like one of them redneck boys. Can you believe that?
M	FORREST	My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And her momma before her cooked shrimp. And her momma before her momma cooked shrimp, too. Bubba's family knew everything...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...there was to know about the shrimpin' business.
F	BUBBA	I know everything there is to know about the shrimpin' business. Matter of fact, I'm goin' into the shrimpin' business for myself after I get out the Army.
M	FORREST	Okay.
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Gump! What's your sole purpose in this Army?
M	FORREST	To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Godamnit, Gump! You're a goddamned genius! That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard. You must have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred and sixty! You are godamned gifted, Private Gump!
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Listen up, people... Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs. It's not really hard. You just make your bed real neat and remember to stand up straight.
M	DRILL SERGEANT	That is one very intelligent individual! You lock your scuzzy bodies up behind that private and do exactly what he does and you will go far in this man's army!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And always answer every question with "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Is that clear?
M	FORREST & RECRUITS	Yes, Drill Sergeant! What you do is you just drag your nets across the bottom. On a good day, you can catch over a hundred pounds of shrimp. If everything goes all right, two men shrimpin' ten hours, less what you spends on gas, you can...
M	FORREST	Done, Drill Sergeant!
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Gump!
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?
M	FORREST	You told me to, Drill Sergeant.
M	DRILL SERGEANT	Jesus Christ! This is a new company record. If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommended you for O.C.S., Private Gump. You are gonna be a General some day, Gump! Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!
F	BUBBA	Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole...
F	BUBBA	...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...
F	BUBBA	...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... that's, that's about it. Nighttime in the Army is a lovely time.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.
M	YOUNG PRIVATE	Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on her!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble over... some photos of her in her college sweater. And she was thrown out of school.
M	SONG	"My baby does the hanky-panky..." But that wasn't a bad thing. Because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photo and offered Jenny a job singing in a show. The first chance I got, I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show.
M	EMCEE	That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber. And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure, direct from Hollywood, California, our very own beatnik beauty, let's give a big round of applause to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.
M	CROWD	Bobbie... Bobbie...
F	JENNY	"Yes, and how many seas must the white dove said, before she sleeps in the sand."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Her dream had come true. She was a folk singer.
F	JENNY	"Yes, how many times must the cannonballs fly before they're forever banned."
M	MAN #1	You gotta lose the guitar, darling.
M	MAN #2	Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up. Shake it up now.
M	MAN #3	Hey, somebody ought to get her a harmonica.
F	JENNY	"The answer, my friend is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in...
M	MAN #	...skin, honey. This isn't Captain Kangaroo.
M	MEN	Yeah! Come on! Hey, honey, I got something here for you.
M	MAN #5	Goddamnit!
F	JENNY	Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a song here. Polly, get out here! Hey, show us some stuff, honey!
F	JENNY	Shut up! Oh, shut up!
F	JENNY	Forrest, what are you doing here? What are you doing?
M	FORREST	Come on.
F	JENNY	What are you doing? Forrest, let me down!
F	JENNY	You can't keep doing this, Forrest. You can't keep tryin' to rescue me all the time.
M	FORREST	They was tryin' to grab you.
F	JENNY	A lot of people try to grab me. Just -- you can't keep doing this all the time!
M	FORREST	I can't help it. I love you.
F	JENNY	Forrest, you don't know what love is.
F	JENNY	You remember that time we prayed, Forrest? We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away?
M	FORREST	Yes, I do.
F	JENNY	You think I can fly off this bridge?
M	FORREST	What do you mean, Jenny?
F	JENNY	Nothing.
F	JENNY	I gotta get outta here.
M	FORREST	But wait. Jenny!
F	JENNY	Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You just stay away from me, please.
F	JENNY	Can I have a ride?
M	DRIVER	Where you going?
F	JENNY	I don't care.
M	DRIVER	Get in the truck.
M	FORREST	So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country.
F	JENNY	Just hang on a minute.
F	JENNY	Listen, you promise me something, okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave, you just run, okay? Just run away.
M	FORREST	Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the time.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And just like that. ...she was gone.
F	MRS. GUMP	You come back safe to me, do ya hear?
M	SONG	"Some folks are born made to wave the flag. Ooh, they're red, white and blue. And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point the cannon at you all. It ain't me. It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, they told us that Vietnam was gonna be very different from the United Sates of America.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Except for all the beer cans and the barbecue, it was.
F	BUBBA	Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in these waters. They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp. You know, after we win this war, and we take over everything we can get American shrimpers to come on here and shrimp these waters. We'll just shrimp all the time, man. So much shrimp, why, you wouldn't believe it.
F	LT. DAN	You must be my F.N.G.'s.
M	BUBBA AND FORREST	Morning', sir!
F	LT. DAN	Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute me. There are goddamned snipers all around this area who would love to grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.
F	LT. DAN	What's wrong with your lips?
F	BUBBA	I was born with big gums, sir.
F	LT. DAN	Yeah, well, you better tuck that in. Gonna get that caught on a trip wire. Where you boys from in the world?
M	BUBBA & FORREST	Alabama, sir!
F	LT. DAN	You twins?
M	FORREST	No, we are not relations, sir.
F	LT. DAN	Look, it's pretty basic here.
F	LT. DAN	You stick with me, you learn from the guys who been in country awhile, you'll be right. There is one item of G.I. gear that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead grunt.
F	LT. DAN	Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green. Try and keep your feet dry when we're out humpin'. I want you boys to remember to change your socks wherever we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet right off his legs.
F	LT. DAN	Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is that sling-rope I told you to order.
M	SGT. SIMS	I put in requisitions at Battalion.
F	LT. DAN	Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those sonabitches again, call them again and again and again. I don't care how much it takes...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant. He was from a long, great military tradition. Somebody in his family had fought and died in every single American war.
F	LT. DAN	Goddamnit, kick some ass!
M	SGT. SIMS	I'm on it, Lieutenant.
F	LT. DAN	Get on it! I guess you could say he had a lot to live up to.
F	LT. DAN	So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh? Well, I've been through there. Little Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake down your gear, see the platoon sergeant, draw what you need for the field.
F	LT. DAN	If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burnin' right here.
F	LT. DAN	Two standing orders in this platoon. One, take good care of your feet. Two, try not to do anything stupid, like gettin' yourself killed.
M	FORREST	I sure hope I don't let him down.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I got to see a lot of countryside. We would take these real long walks.
M	SONG	And we were always lookin' for this guy named Charlie. I can't get no relief.
F	LT. DAN	Hold it up!
M	SGT. SIMS	Hold up, boys! It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always gettin' these funny feelings about a rock or a trail, or the road, so he'd tell you to get down, shut up!
F	LT. DAN	Get down! Shut up! So we did.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, I don't know much about anything, but I think some of American's best young men served in this war. There was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland, he was from Detroit.
M	CLEVELAND	Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the hell's going on?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And Tex was, well, I don't remember where Tex come from.
F	LT. DAN	Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your feet! Still got ten clicks to go to that river.
F	LT. DAN	All right, move out! Comin' out. Look alive out there.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	The good thing about Vietnam is there was always someplace to go.
M	LT. DAN (V.O.)	Fire in the hole!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And there was always something to do.
F	LT. DAN	Mount 'em up.
M	SGT. SIMS	Spread out! Cover his back.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	One day it started raining, and it didn't quit for four months.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	We been through every kind of rain there is. Little bitty stingin' rain...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...and big ol' fat rain.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Rain that flew in sideways. And sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Shoot, it even rained at night.
F	BUBBA	Hey Forrest...
M	FORREST	Hey Bubba...
F	BUBBA	I'm gonna lean up against you, you just lean right back against me.
F	BUBBA	This way, we don't have to sleep with our heads in the mud. You know why we a good partnership, Forrest? 'Cause we be watchin' out for one another. Like brothers and stuff. Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've been thinkin' about. I got a very important question to ask you. How would you like to go into the shrimpin' business with me?
M	FORREST	Okay.
F	BUBBA	Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too. So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we can just work it together. Split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty. And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can get.
M	FORREST	That's a fine idea.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Bubba did have a fine idea.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it. I sent her letters. Not every day, but almost. I told her what I was doin' and asked her what she was doing, and I told her how I thought about her always.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time I'd always let her know that I was okay.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Then I'd sign each letter, "Love, Forrest Gump."
M	SONG	"There's something happenin' here. What it is ain't exactly clear. There's a man with a gun over there, telling' me I got to beware."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	This one day, we was out walking, like always, and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain and the sun come out.
F	LT. DAN	Take cover!
F	LT. DAN	Get that pig up here, goddammit!
F	BUBBA	Forrest, you okay?
F	LT. DAN	...Strongarm, please be advised...
F	BUBBA	Medic, we got a man down!
F	LT. DAN	Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!
F	LT. DAN	Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have incoming from the treeline at point blue plus two. A.K's and rockets...
M	SOLDIER WITH BIG MACHINE GUN	Misfire! Misfire!
F	LT. DAN	Goddammit, Mac! Get that pig unfucked and get it in the treeline!
F	LT. DAN	Ah, Jesus! My unit is down hard and hurting! 6 pulling back to the blue line, Leg Lima 6 out! Pull back! Pull back!
F	BUBBA	Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest!
F	LT. DAN	Pull back!
F	BUBBA	Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest! Run! Run!
M	SGT. SIMS	Pull back! Let's go!
F	LT. DAN	Run, goddammit, run!
M	SOLDIER	Medic! Medic! Jesus, can I get a medic?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I ran so far and so fast that pretty soon I was all by myself, which was a bad thing.
M	FORREST	Bubba!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Bubba was my best good friend. I had to make sure he was okay.
M	1ST SOLDIER	Any friendlies out there?
M	2ND SOLDIER	Yeah, I've got three over there.
M	1ST SOLDIER	Where the hell are you?
M	FORREST	Bubba?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And on my way back to find Bubba, well, there was this boy laying on the ground.
M	FORREST	Tex!
M	FORREST	Okay.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was, so I grabbed him up and run him out of there.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And every time I went back looking for Bubba, somebody else was saying, "Help me, Forrest. Help me."
M	DALLAS	Can't hear... Can't hear...
M	2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER	No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.
M	STRONGARM	You're danger close for crack air, over.
F	LT. DAN	Roger, Strongarm, I know my position is danger close! We got Charlie all over this area! I gotta have those fast movers in here now! Over!
M	STRONGARM	Six, Strongarm, we want...
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!
F	LT. DAN	I know he's dead! My whole goddamned platoon is wiped out!
M	STRONGARM	Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, how copy you this transmission? Over.
F	LT. DAN	Goddammit! What are you doing? Leave me here! Get away. Just leave me here! Get out!
M	STRONGARM	Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is Strongarm, be advised, your fast movers are inbound at this time, over.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me.
M	FORREST	Ah, something bit me!
F	LT. DAN	You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't leave the platoon! I told you to leave me there, Gump. Forget about me. Get yourself out! Did you hear what I said! Goddammit, pull me down! Get your ass out of here!
F	LT. DAN	I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, goddamn you! What the hell do you think you're going?
M	FORREST	To get Bubba.
F	LT. DAN	I got an air strike inbound right now. They're gonna nape the whole area.
F	LT. DAN	Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's an order!
M	FORREST	I gotta find Bubba!
F	BUBBA	Forrest...
M	FORREST	Bubba...
F	BUBBA	I'm okay.
M	FORREST	Oh, Bubba, no...
F	BUBBA	Naw, I'm gonna be all right.
M	FORREST	Come on. Come on. Come here...
F	BUBBA	I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.
F	LT. DAN	Helo's inbound. Pop smoke, get it up there! If I'd a known this was gonna be the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk, I'd a thought of something better to say.
M	FORREST	Hey, Bubba...
F	BUBBA	Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why'd this happen?
M	FORREST	You got shot.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Then Bubba said something I won't even forget.
F	BUBBA	I wanna go home.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Bubba was my best good friend. And even I know that ain't something you can find just around the corner. Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat captain, but instead he died right there by that river in Vietnam.
M	FORREST	That's all I have to say about that.
M	MAN	It was a bullet, wasn't it?
M	FORREST	A bullet?
M	MAN	That jumped up and bit you.
M	FORREST	Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the buttocks. They said it was a million dollar wound, but the Army must keep that money, 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars. The only good thing about being wounded in the buttocks...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...is the ice cream. They gave me all the ice cream I could eat. And guess what. A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.
M	MALE NURSE	It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.
M	MALE NURSE	Harper...
M	SOLDIER	Cooper, Larson, Webster, Gump, Gump...
M	FORREST	I'm Forrest Gump.
M	SOLDIER	Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit? Turn it off!
M	ANNOUNCER	From the D.M.Z. to the Delta, you are tuned to the American Forces Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6, Saigon.
M	SOLDIER	Good catch, Gump. You know how to play this?
M	SOLDIER	Come on, let me show you. Here.
M	SOLDIER	Now the secret to this game is, no matter what happens, never, never take your eye off the ball.
M	SOLDIER	All right...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	For some reason, ping pong came very natural to me.
M	SOLDIER	See, any idiot can play.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	So I started playing it all the time.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I played ping-pong even when I didn't have anyone to play ping-pong with. The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water, whatever that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I played ping-pong so much, I even played it in my sleep.
F	LT. DAN	Now, you listen to me. We all have a destiny. Nothing just happens, it's all part of a plan. I should have died out there with my men! But now, I'm nothing but a goddamned cripple! A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at me! Do you see that? Do you know what it's like not to be able to use your legs?
M	FORREST	Well... Yes, sir, I do.
F	LT. DAN	Did you hear what I said? You cheated me. I had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field! With honor! That was my destiny! And you cheated me out of it! You understand what I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny. I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.
M	FORREST	Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.
F	LT. DAN	Look at me. What am I gonna do now? What am I gonna do now?
M	OFFICER	P.F.C. Gump?
M	FORREST	Yes, sir!
M	OFFICER	As you were.
M	OFFICER	Son, you've been awarded the Medal of Honor.
M	FORREST	Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they want to give me a me...
M	FORREST	Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?
M	NURSE	They sent him home.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.
M	ANCHORMAN	The ceremony was kicked off with a candid speech by the President regarding the need for further escalation of the war in Vietnam. President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor to men from each of the Armed Services.
M	PRESIDENT JOHNSON	America owes you a debt of gratitude, son.
M	PRESIDENT JOHNSON	I understand you were wounded. Where were you hit?
M	FORREST	In the buttocks, sir.
M	PRESIDENT JOHNSON	Oh, that must be a sight.
M	PRESIDENT JOHNSON	I'd kinda like to see that.
M	PRESIDENT JOHNSON	Goddamn, son.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	After that, Momma went to the hotel to lay down, so I went out for a walk to see our national capital.
F	ISABEL	Hilary, all right, I've got the vets, what do you want me to do with them?
F	HILARY	What are you doing here so late?
F	HILARY	We've been waiting for you for half an hour, so just get them in a line, will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures later. You look great. Oh come on, get in this line, come on, come on right in line. Come on, let him here, let him in here.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	It's a good thing Momma was resting, 'cause the street was awful crowded with people looking at all the statues and monuments. And some of them people were loud and pushy.
F	HILARY	Okay, follow me! Come on.
F	HILARY	Let's move it out.
M	VET	Hey, buddy, come on. We could use your help.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Everywhere I went, I had to stand in line.
F	HILARY	Follow me, let's go!
F	ISABEL	All right, come on, guys.
F	HILARY	Stand here.
M	VET	Hey, you're a good man for doin' this. Good!
M	FORREST	Okay.
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	We must declare to that fucking impostor in the White House -- Johnson. We ain't going to work on your farm no more! Yeah! There was this man, giving a little talk. And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt...
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	Now, I'm going to bring up some soldiers that are going to talk about the war, man... ...and he liked to say the "F" word. A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And every time...
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	...that war has come home, and we have to stop these politicians... ...he said "F" word, people, for some reason, well, they'd cheer.
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	Come on, man. Come up here, man.
F	HILARY	Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
F	HILARY	Come on, get up there. Come on. Move, move. Let's go! Let's go.
M	VET	Come on, go. You can do it. Just get up there. Go on. That's it.
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	Tell us a little bit about the war, man.
M	FORREST	The war in Vietnam?
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
M	FORREST	Well... There was only one thing I could say about the war in Vietnam.
M	FORREST	...there was only one thing I could say about the war in Vietnam.
M	FORREST	In Vietnam war...
M	POLICEMAN	Hey, what the hell are you doing?
F	HILARY	I'll beat your head in, you goddamned oinker!
F	ISABEL	Christ, what'd they do with this?
M	CROWD	We can't hear you! We can't hear anything!
F	HILARY	This one! This one! Give me that!
F	HILARY	That's it.
M	FORREST	...and that's all I have to say about that.
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	That's so right on, man. You said it all. What's your name, man?
M	FORREST	My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.
M	ABBIE HOFFMAN	Forrest Gump!
M	CROWD	Forrest Gump!
F	JENNY	Forrest! Forrest!
M	FORREST	Jenny!
F	JENNY	Forrest!
F	JENNY	Hey! Hey!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	It was the happiest moment of my life.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Jenny and me were just peas and carrots again. She showed me around, and even introduced me...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...to some of her new friends.
M	RUBEN	Shut that blind, man. And get your white ass away from that window. Don't you know we in war here?
F	JENNY	Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's one of us. He's one of us.
M	MASAI	Let me tell you about us.
M	WESLEY	Where the hell have you been?
F	JENNY	I ran into a friend.
M	MASAI	Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders from the racial onslaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize our black leaders, rape our women, and destroy our black communists.
M	BLACK PANTHER	Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.
M	WESLEY	Who's the baby killer?
F	JENNY	This is my good friend I told you about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley. Wesley and I live together in Berkeley, and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of S.D.S.
M	MASAI	Let me tell you something else.
M	WESLEY	I want to talk to you.
F	JENNY	Okay, but...
M	WESLEY	No. Now! Goddammit!
M	MASAI	We are here to offer protection and help for all of those who need our help, because we, the Black Panthers, are against the war in Vietnam. Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them. Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities as they sleep in their beds at night. Yes, we are against all these racists and imperial dog acts.
F	JENNY	You are a fucking asshole!
F	JENNY	Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest! Stop it!
F	JENNY	Stop it!
M	WESLEY	Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought you here. I should have known it was just gonna be some bullshit hassle.
M	FORREST	He should not be hitting you, Jenny.
F	JENNY	Come on, Forrest.
M	FORREST	Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
F	JENNY	He doesn't mean it when he does things like this. He doesn't.
M	FORREST	I would never hurt you, Jenny.
F	JENNY	I know you wouldn't, Forrest.
M	FORREST	I wanted to be your boyfriend.
F	JENNY	That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You look handsome in it. You do.
M	FORREST	You know what?
F	JENNY	What?
M	FORREST	I'm glad we were here together in our national capitol.
F	JENNY	Me too, Forrest. I have so much to tell you, you won't believe what's been going on...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	We walked around all night, Jenny and me, just talkin'.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She told me about all the travellin' she's done.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And how she'd discovered ways to expand her mind and learn how to live in harmony...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...which must be out west somewhere, 'cause she made it all the way to California.
F	JENNY	"Smile on your brother, everybody get together, try to love on another right now"
M	YOUNG HIPPIE	Hey, anybody want to go to San Francisco?
F	JENNY	I'll go.
M	YOUNG HIPPIE	Far out!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I was a very special night for the two of us. I didn't want it to end.
M	FORREST	I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
F	JENNY	I have to, Forrest.
M	WESLEY	Jenny? Things got a little out of hand. It's just this war and that, that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I would never hurt you. You know that.
M	FORREST	You know what I think? I think you should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!
F	JENNY	Forrest, we have very different lives, you know.
M	FORREST	I want you to have this.
F	JENNY	Forrest, I can't keep this.
M	FORREST	I got it just by doing what you told me to do.
F	JENNY	Why're you so good to me?
M	FORREST	You're my girl.
F	JENNY	I'll always be your girl.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And just like that, she was gone out of my life again.
M	NEIL ARMSTRONG	That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the surface is fine and powdery. I can, I can pick it up loosely.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I thought I was going back to Vietnam, but instead, they decided the best way for me to fight communists was to play ping-pong. So I was in the Special Services, traveling around the country cheering up all them wounded veterans and showing them how to play...
M	FORREST	...ping-pong. I was so good that some years later... ...the Army decided I should be on the All-American Ping-Pong Team. We were the first Americans to visit the land of China in like a million years or something like that, and somebody said that world peace was in our hands. But all I did was play ping-pong. When I got home...
M	FORREST	...I was national celebrity. Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.
M	DICK CAVETT	Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.
M	DICK CAVETT	Mr. Gump, have a seat.
M	DICK CAVETT	Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
M	JOHN LENNON	Welcome home.
M	DICK CAVETT	You had quite a trip. Can you, uh, tell us, uh, what was China like?
M	FORREST	Well, in the land of China, people hardly got nothing at all.
M	JOHN LENNON	No possessions?
M	FORREST	And in China, they never go to church.
M	JOHN LENNON	No religion, too?
M	DICK CAVETT	Oh. Hard to imagine.
M	JOHN LENNON	Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Some years later, that nice young man from England was on his way home to see his little boy and was signing some autographs. For no particular reason at all, somebody shot him.
F	LT. DAN	They gave you the Congressional Medal of Honor.
M	FORREST	Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant Dan!
F	LT. DAN	They gave you the Congressional Medal of Honor!
M	FORREST	Yes sir, they sure did.
F	LT. DAN	They gave you an imbecile, a moron who goes on television and makes a fool out himself in front of the whole damn country, the Congressional Medal of Honor.
M	FORREST	Yes, sir.
F	LT. DAN	Well, then, that's just perfect! Yeah, well I just got one thing to say to that. Goddamn bless America.
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a hotel. And because he didn't have no legs, he spent most of his time exercising his arms.
F	LT. DAN	Take a right, take a right.
M	TAXI DRIVER #1	Hey! Come on already!
F	LT. DAN	Ah!
M	FORREST	What are you doing here in New York, Lieutenant Dan?
F	LT. DAN	I'm living off the government tit. Sucking it dry.
F	LT. DAN	Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? I'm walking here! Ah, get out... Why don't you go home before you kill yourself? Get out of the way!
F	LT. DAN	Come on, go! Go! Go! I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and celebrated the holidays.
M	BOB HOPE	You have a great year and hurry home. God bless you.
F	LT. DAN	Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?
M	FORREST	I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for him, sir.
F	LT. DAN	That's all these cripples, down at the V.A., that's all they ever talk about.
F	LT. DAN	Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I found Jesus? They even had a priest come and talk to me. He said God is listening, but I have to help myself. Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart, I'll get to walk beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven.
F	LT. DAN	Did you hear what I said? Walk beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well, kiss my crippled ass. God is listening. What a crock of shit.
M	FORREST	I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.
F	LT. DAN	Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why don't you get your ass down to the corner and get us another bottle of wine.
M	FORREST	Yes, sir.
M	DICK CLARK	We are at approximately 45th Street in New York City at One Astor Plaza. This is the site of the old Astor Hotel. Down below us, well over a hundred thousand people are milling about, cheering with horns and whistles and hats...
F	LT. DAN	What the hell's in Bayou La Batre?
M	FORREST	Shrimpin' boats.
F	LT. DAN	Shrimpin' boats? Who gives a shit about shrimpin' boats?
M	FORREST	I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin' boats as soon as I have some money. I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam, that as soon as the war was over, we'd go in partners. He'd be the captain of the shrimpin' boat and I'd be his first mate. But now that he's dead, that means that I gotta be the captain.
F	LT. DAN	A shrimp boat captain.
M	FORREST	Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.
F	LT. DAN	Now hear this! Private Gump here is gonna be a shrimp boat captain. Well, I tell you what, Gilligan, the day that you are a shrimp boat captain, I will come and be your first mate.
M	FORREST	Okay.
F	LT. DAN	If you're ever a shrimp boat captain, that's the day I'm an astronaut.
F	LENORE	Danny, what are you complaining about?
F	CARLA	What are you doing, huh?
F	LENORE	Mr. Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?
M	FORREST	My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.
F	LT. DAN	This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs Lenore.
F	CARLA	So where you been, baby-cakes, huh? Haven't seen you around lately. You know, you should have been here for Christmas 'cause Tommy bought a round on the house and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.
F	LT. DAN	Well, well, I had, uh, company.
F	LENORE	Hey, hey! We was, we was just there. That's at Times Square.
F	LENORE	Don't you just love New Year's? You get to start all over.
F	CARLA	Hey, Lenore.
F	LENORE	Everybody gets a second chance.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	It's funny, but in the middle of all that fun, I began to think about Jenny.
M	DICK CLARK	...getting wild out there. It's beginning to...
M	DICK CLARK	...pour here in Times Square. It's been off-and-on all night, but these people hang in there.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Wondering how she was spending her New Year's night out in California.
M	CROWD	
M	CROWD	...1! Happy New Year!
M	PATRONS	"Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind...
M	FORREST	Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!
M	PATRONS	Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne."
F	LENORE	What are you, stupid or something? What's your problem? What's his problem? Did you lose your pecker in the war or something?
F	CARLA	What, is your friend stupid or something?
F	LT. DAN	What did you say?
F	CARLA	I said, is your friend stupid or something?
F	LT. DAN	Hey! Don't call him stupid!
F	CARLA	Don't push me like that!
F	LENORE	Hey, don't you push her!
F	LT. DAN	You shut up! Don't you ever call him stupid!
F	CARLA	What's the matter, baby? Why you treating me like shit?
F	LT. DAN	Get the hell out of here!
F	LENORE	You stupid gimp. You belong in "Ripley's Believe It Or Not."
F	LT. DAN	Get the hell out of here! Go on!
F	LENORE	You should be in a side show!
F	LT. DAN	Go on! Get out of here! Get out of here!
F	LENORE	You big loser!
F	CARLA	Come on, Lenore. We don't need this shit!
F	LENORE	You're so pathetic.
F	LT. DAN	Get out of here!
F	CARLA	You retard!
F	LENORE	You loser! You freak!
F	LT. DAN	No!
M	FORREST	I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes like cigarettes.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's some things you just can't change. He didn't want to be called crippled, just like I didn't want to be called stupid.
F	LT. DAN	Happy New Year.
M	ANCHORMAN	The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with President Nixon today at an Oval Office ceremony... And wouldn't you know it...
M	FORREST	...a few months later they invited me and the ping-pong team to visit the White House. So I went again. And I met the President of the United States again.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Only this time they didn't get us rooms in a real fancy hotel.
M	PRESIDENT NIXON	So are you enjoying yourself in our national capital, young man?
M	FORREST	Yes, sir.
M	PRESIDENT NIXON	Well, where are you staying?
M	FORREST	It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
M	PRESIDENT NIXON	Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very modern. I'll have my people take care of it for you.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Security, Frank Wills.
M	FORREST	Yeah, sir, you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way. The lights are off, and they must be looking for the fuse box or something, 'cause them flashlights they're, they're keeping me awake.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Okay, sir. I'll check it out.
M	FORREST	Thank you.
M	SECURITY GUARD	No problem.
M	FORREST	Good night.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Good night.
M	PRESIDENT NIXON	Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
M	PRESIDENT NIXON	Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office. As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term, I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office...
M	OFFICER	Sergeant Gump!
M	FORREST	Yes, sir!
M	OFFICER	As you were. I have your discharge papers. Your service is up, son.
M	FORREST	Does this mean I can't play ping pong no more?
M	OFFICER	For the Army it does. And just like that, my service in the United States Army was over. So I went home.
M	FORREST	I'm home, Momma.
F	MRS. GUMP	I know, I know.
F	MRS. GUMP	Louise, he's here. He's here, everybody. Now, when I got home, I had no idea that Momma had had all sorts of visitors.
F	MRS. GUMP	We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest. Everybody wants you to use their ping-pong stuff. One man even left a check for twenty-five thousand dollars if you'd be agreeable to saying you like using their paddle.
M	FORREST	Oh, Momma. I only like using my own paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.
F	LOUISE	Hey, Forrest.
F	MRS. GUMP	I know that. I know that. But it's twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest. I thought maybe you could hold it for a while, see if it grows on you. Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look real good.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	That Momma, she sure was right. It's funny how things work out.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I didn't stay home for long, because I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I always try to keep my promise. So I went on down to Bayou La Batre to meet Bubba's family and make their introduction.
M	MRS. BLUE	Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?
M	FORREST	Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.
M	MRS. BLUE	I guess.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And of course, I paid my respect to Bubba himself.
M	FORREST	Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out.
M	FORREST	I'm taking the twenty-four thousand, five hundred and six-two dollars and forty-seven cents that I got...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...well, that's left after a new hair cut and a new suit and I took Momma out to real fancy dinner and I bought a bus ticket and three Doctor Peppers.
M	OLD SHRIMPER	Tell me something. Are you stupid or something?
M	FORREST	Stupid is as stupid does, sir.
M	FORREST	Well, that's what's left after me saying, "When I was in China on the All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flex- O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody knows it isn't true, but Momma says it's just a little white lie so it wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas, ropes and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat. Now, Bubba had told me everything he knows about shrimpin', but you know what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.
M	FORREST	I only caught five.
M	OLD SHRIMPER	A couple of more, you can have yourself a cocktail.
M	OLD SHRIMPER	Hey, you ever think about namin' this old boat?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I'd never named a boat before, but there was only one I could think of.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	The most beautiful name in the wide world.
M	GIRL	Okay.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long while. But...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	But I thought about her a lot. And I hoped that whatever she was doing made her happy.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I thought about Jenny all the time.
M	FORREST	Hi!
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?
F	LT. DAN	Well, I thought I'd try out my sea legs.
M	FORREST	Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.
F	LT. DAN	Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I had to see this for myself. And I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain, that I'd be your first mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of my word.
M	FORREST	Okay.
F	LT. DAN	Yeah, but don't you be thinking that I'm gonna be calling you sir.
M	FORREST	No, sir.
M	FORREST	That's my boat.
F	LT. DAN	I have a feeling if we head the east, we'll find some shrimp. So, take a left. Take a left.
M	FORREST	Which way?
F	LT. DAN	Over there! They're over there! Get, get on the wheel and take a left!
M	FORREST	Okay.
F	LT. DAN	Gump, what are you doing? Take a left! Left! That's where we're gonna find those shrimp, my boy! That's where we'll find 'em.
M	FORREST	Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
F	LT. DAN	Okay, so I was wrong.
M	FORREST	Well, how we gonna find them?
F	LT. DAN	Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	So I went to church every Sunday...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too. Though I think he left the praying up to me.
M	FORREST	No shrimp.
F	LT. DAN	Where the hell's this God of yours?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that, 'cause right then, God showed up.
F	LT. DAN	You'll never sink this boat!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.
F	LT. DAN	Come on! You call this a storm?
F	LT. DAN	Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It's time for a showdown! You and me. I'm right here. Come and get me! You'll never sink this boat!
M	ANCHORMAN	Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday...
M	ANCHORMAN	...destroying nearly everything in its path. And as in other towns up and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry...
M	ANCHORMAN	...has fallen victim to Carmen and has been left in utter ruin. Speaking with local officials, this reporter has learned, in fact, only one shrimping boat actually survived the storm.
F	MRS. GUMP	Louise. Louise, there's Forrest!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	After that, shrimpin' was easy.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And since people still needed them shrimps for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all...
M	FORREST	...and we were the only boat left standing "Bubba-Gump" shrimp's what they got. We got a whole bunch of boats. Twelve Jenny's, a big ol' warehouse, we even have hats that says "Bubba-Gump" on 'em. "Bubba- Gump Shrimp." It's a household name.
M	MAN	Hold on there, boy. Are you telling me you're the owner of the Bubba- Gump Shrimp Corporation?
M	FORREST	Yes, sir. We've got more money than Davy Crocket.
M	MAN	Boy, I've heard some whoppers in my time, but that tops them all. We was sitting next to a millionaire!
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	Well, I thought it was a very lovely story. And you tell it so well. With such enthusiasm.
M	FORREST	Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	Well, yes, I would!
M	FORREST	That's him right there.
M	FORREST	And let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.
F	LT. DAN	Forrest, I never thanked you for saving my life.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	He never actually said so, but I think he made his peace with God.
M	ANCHORMAN	For the second time in seventeen days, President Ford escaped possible assassination today when a woman, Sarah Jane Moore, fired on him as he stepped out of a hotel in San Francisco.
M	MARGO	Base to Jenny One. Base to Jenny One.
F	LT. DAN	Jenny One, go Margo.
M	MARGO	Forrest has a phone call.
F	LT. DAN	Yeah, well you'll have to tell them to call him back. He is indisposed at the moment.
M	MARGO	His momma's sick.
M	ANCHORMAN	Lynett Alice Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson better known as "Squeaky," attempted to assassinate the President as he was...
M	FORREST	Where's Momma?
F	LOUISE	She's upstairs.
F	MRS. GUMP	Hi, Forrest.
M	DOCTOR	I'll see you tomorrow.
F	MRS. GUMP	Oh, all right.
M	DOCTOR	We sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?
M	FORREST	What's the matter, Momma?
F	MRS. GUMP	I'm dyin', Forrest. Come on in, sit down over here.
M	FORREST	Why are you dyin', Momma?
F	MRS. GUMP	It's my time. It's just my time. Oh, now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart. Death is just a part of life. It's something we're all destined to do. I didn't know it, but I was destined to be your momma. I did the best I could.
M	FORREST	You did good, Momma.
F	MRS. GUMP	Well, I happened to believe you make your own destiny. You have to do the best with what God gave you.
M	FORREST	What's my destiny, Momma?
F	MRS. GUMP	You're gonna have to figure that out for yourself. Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest. You never know what you're gonna get. Momma always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
F	MRS. GUMP	I will miss you, Forrest.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She had got the cancer and died on a Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it.
M	FORREST	And that's all I have to say about that.
M	FORREST	Didn't you say you were waiting for the Number Seven bus?
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	There'll be another one along shortly.
M	FORREST	Now, because I had been a football star, and a war hero, and a national celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat captain, and a college graduate, the city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, decided to get together and offered me a fine job.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	So, I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Though he did take care of my Bubba- Gump money. He got me invested in some kind of fruit company. And so then I got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money no more.
M	FORREST	And I said, "That's good. One less thing."
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Now, Momma said there's only so much fortune a man really needs...
M	REVEREND	Praise the Lord.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...and the rest is just for showing off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it to the Four Square Gospel Church.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And even though Bubba was dead, and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share.
M	FORREST	And you know what...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.
M	MRS. BLUE	Smells wonderful!
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And 'cause I was godzillionaire and I liked doing it so much. I cut that grass for free.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	But at nighttime, when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And then, she was there.
F	JENNY	Hello, Forrest.
M	FORREST	Hello, Jenny.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Jenny came back and stayed with me.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go. Or maybe it was because she was so tired, because she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years. It was wonderful having her home.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree. And she'd listen about ping-pong and shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'. Jenny most of the time was real quiet.
M	FORREST	...big ol' gobs of rain and little bitty stinging rain and rain...
F	JENNY	How could you do this?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I never really knew why she came back, but I didn't care. It was like olden times. We was like peas and carrots again.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Every day I'd pick pretty flowers and put them in her room for her.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get in the wide world.
F	JENNY	Okay, you can open your eyes.
M	FORREST	New shoes.
F	JENNY	They make them just for running. And she even showed me how to dance. And, well, we was like family... Jenny and me.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And it was the happiest time of my life.
M	ANNOUNCER	And this Fourth is witnessing one of the largest fireworks displays in the nation's two-hundred year history...
F	JENNY	You done watching it?
M	FORREST	Mm-hmm.
M	ANNOUNCER	...here in New York Harbor. After the spectacular display of tall ships earlier, the Statue of Liberty...
F	JENNY	I'm going to bed.
M	FORREST	Will you marry me? I'd make a good husband, Jenny.
F	JENNY	You would, Forrest.
M	FORREST	But you won't marry me.
F	JENNY	You don't want to marry me.
M	FORREST	Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.
M	FORREST	Jenny?
F	JENNY	Forrest, I do love you.
M	CAB DRIVER	Where are you running off to?
F	JENNY	I'm not running.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	That day, for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	So I ran to the end of the road, and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.
M	NEWSCASTER	President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion fell into the arms of security agents. And when I got there...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County. And I figured since I run this far, maybe I'd just run across the great... ...state of Alabama. And that's what I did I ran clear across Alabama.
M	FORREST	For no particular reason, I just kept on going. I ran clear to the ocean.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And when I got there, I figured since I'd gone this far, I might as well turn around, just keep on going.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	When I got to another ocean, I figured since I've gone this far, I might as well just turn back, keep right on going.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	When I got tired, I slept. When I got hungry, I ate.
M	FORREST	When I had to go, you know, I went.
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	And so, you just ran?
M	FORREST	Yeah.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba, and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all, I thought about Jenny. I thought about her a lot.
M	NEWSCASTER	For more than two years now, a man named Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep, has been running across America.
M	NEWSCASTER	Charles Cooper brings us this report.
M	NEWSMAN	For the fourth time on his journey across America, Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is about to cross the Mississippi River again today.
F	JENNY	I'll be damned. Forrest...
M	NEWSMAN	Sir, why are you running?
M	1ST REPORTER	Why are you running?
M	2ND REPORTER	Are you doing this for world peace?
M	3RD REPORTER	Are you doing this for women's right?
M	NEWSMAN	Or for the environment?
M	REPORTER	Or for animals?
M	3RD REPORTER	Or for nuclear arms?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	They just couldn't believe that somebody would do all that running for no particular reason.
M	2ND REPORTER	Why are you doing this?
M	FORREST	I just felt like running.
M	FORREST	I just left like running.
M	YOUNG MAN	It's you. I can't believe it's really you.
M	FORREST	Now, for some reason what I was doing seemed to make sense to people.
M	YOUNG MAN	I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know. I said, here's a guy that's got his act together. Here's somebody who's got it, all figured out. Here's somebody who has the answer. I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump. So, I got company.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And after that I got more company. And then...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...even more people joined in. Somebody later told me...
M	FORREST	...it gave people hope. Now... Now, I don't know anything about that, but...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Some of those people asked me if I could help them out.
M	AGING HIPPIE	Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering if you might help me, huh? Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business and I've been trying to think up a good slogan. And since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here, I thought you might be able to help me jump into... Whoa! Man, you just ran through a big pile of dogshit!
M	FORREST	It happens.
M	AGING HIPPIE	What, shit?
M	FORREST	Sometimes.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And some years later I heard that fella did come up with a bumper sticker slogan...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	...and he make a lot of money off of it.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Another time I was running along, somebody who had lost all his money in the T-shirt business, and he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt, but he couldn't draw that well and he didn't have a camera.
M	WILD-EYED MAN	I think it would be really fortunate for me if I could get your name on these, oh, your face and name on these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.
M	WILD-EYED MAN	Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.
M	FORREST	Have a nice day.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And some years later I found out that that man did come up with a idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot of money off of it.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Anyway, like I was saying, I had a lot of company. My Momma always said you got to put the past behind you before you can move on. And I think that's what my running was all about. I had run for three years, two months, fourteen days, and sixteen hours.
M	YOUNG MAN	Quiet. Quiet, he's gonna say something.
M	FORREST	I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go home now.
M	YOUNG MAN	Now what are we supposed to do?
M	FORREST (V.O.)	And just like that, my running days was over. So, I went home to Alabama.
M	NEWSCASTER	Moments ago, at two twenty-five p.m., as President Reagan was leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel...
M	NEWSCASTER	...five or six gunshots were fired by an unknown would-be assassin. The President was shot in the chest and the assailant was immediately tackled by a half a dozen lawmen. As the Presidential...
F	LOUISE	I picked up the mail.
M	FORREST	Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	One day, out of the blue clear sky, I got a letter from Jenny...
M	FORREST	...wondering if I could come down to Savannah to see her, and that's what I'm doing here. She saw me on TV, running, I'm supposed to go on the Number Nine bus to Richmond Street and get off and go one block left to 1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	Why, you don't need to take a bus. Henry Street is just five or six blocks down that way.
M	FORREST	Down that way?
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	Down that way.
M	FORREST	It was nice talking' to you.
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	I hope everything works out for you.
F	JENNY	Hey! Forrest! How you doing?
M	FORREST	Hi.
F	JENNY	Come in. Come in.
M	FORREST	I got your letter.
F	JENNY	Oh, I was wondering about that.
M	FORREST	Is this your house?
F	JENNY	Yeah, it's messy right now. I just got off work.
M	FORREST	It's nice. You got air conditioning.
M	FORREST	Ah...
F	JENNY	Thank you.
M	FORREST	I ate some.
F	JENNY	Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of your, of your clippings and everything. There you are. This, I got your running.
M	FORREST	I ran a long way. For a long time.
F	JENNY	There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know how to say this. Um, I just... I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed up for a long time, and...
M	LYNN MARIE	Yoo-hoo.
F	JENNY	Hey.
M	LYNN MARIE	Hi.
F	JENNY	Hey, you. This is an old friend from Alabama.
M	LYNN MARIE	Oh, how do you do?
F	JENNY	Ah, listen, next week my schedule changes, so I'll be able to... but thanks for picking up.
M	LYNN MARIE	No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double parked.
F	JENNY	Okay.
M	LYNN MARIE	Bye.
F	JENNY	Thanks. This is very good friend, Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?
M	LITTLE BOY	Hello, Mr. Gump.
M	FORREST	Hello.
M	LITTLE BOY	Now, can I go watch TV now?
F	JENNY	Yes, you can. Just keep it low.
M	FORREST	You're a momma, Jenny.
F	JENNY	I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.
M	FORREST	Like me.
F	JENNY	I named him after his Daddy.
M	FORREST	He got a daddy named Forrest, too?
F	JENNY	You're his daddy, Forrest.
F	JENNY	Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest. There's nothing you need to do, okay? You didn't do anything wrong. Okay?
F	JENNY	Isn't he beautiful?
M	FORREST	He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. But... is, is he smart, or is he...
F	JENNY	He's very smart. He's one of the smartest in his class.
F	JENNY	Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.
M	BERT	Oh, great.
M	ERNIE	Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?
M	BERT	A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want, Ernie?
M	FORREST	What are you watching.
M	FORREST JR.	Bert and Ernie.
M	ERNIE	Well, it's the first stage. Bert. It's planning to write a story, Bert. I have pencils right here to write with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper. I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we have the paper to write on.
F	JENNY	Forrest, I'm sick.
M	FORREST	What, do you have a cough due to cold?
F	JENNY	I have some kind virus. And the doctors don't, they don't know what it is. And there isn't anything they can do about it.
M	FORREST	You could come home with me. Jenny, you and little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll take care of you if you're sick.
F	JENNY	Would you marry me, Forrest?
M	FORREST	Okay.
M	MINISTER	Please take your seats.
F	LOUISE	Forrest, it's time to start.
F	JENNY	Hi. Your tie.
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!
F	LT. DAN	Hello, Forrest.
M	FORREST	You got new legs. New legs!
F	LT. DAN	Yeah, I got new legs.
F	LT. DAN	Custom-made titanium alloy. It's what they use on the space shuttle.
M	FORREST	Magic legs.
F	LT. DAN	This is my fiancee, Susan.
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan!
M	SUSAN	Hi, Forrest.
M	FORREST	Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.
F	JENNY	Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.
M	MINISTER	Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest to be your husband? If so, I pronounce you man and wife.
M	FORREST	Hey.
F	JENNY	Hey.
F	JENNY	Hey, Forrest, were you scared in Vietnam?
M	FORREST	Yes. Well, I, I don't know.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out. And then it was nice. It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	There was over a million sparkles on the water. Like that mountain lake.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	It was so clear, Jenny. It looks like there were two skies, one on top of the other. And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	I couldn't tell where heavens stopped and the earth began. It was so beautiful.
F	JENNY	I wish I could have been there with you.
M	FORREST	You were.
F	JENNY	I love you. You died on a Saturday morning.
M	FORREST	And I had you placed here under our tree.
M	FORREST	And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground. Momma...
M	FORREST	...always said dyin' was a part of life.
M	FORREST	I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, he's doing just fine.
M	FORREST JR.	"But he wasn't quite sure. Everywhere they went, the new guests...
M	FORREST (V.O.)	About to start school again soon. I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner...
M	FORREST	...every day. I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day. Teaching him how to play ping pong.
M	FORREST	Okay... He's really good.
M	FORREST	Forrest, you go.
M	FORREST (V.O.)	We fish a lot.
M	FORREST	And every night, we read a book. He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a letter, and he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you.
M	FORREST	Jenny, I don't know if Momma was right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.
M	FORREST	Here's your bus. Okay.
M	FORREST	Hey, I know this.
M	FORREST JR.	I'm gonna show that for show-and- tell because grandma used to read it to you.
M	FORREST	My favorite book.
M	FORREST	Well...
M	FORREST	...okay. Hey, there you go.
M	FORREST	Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to tell you I love you.
M	FORREST JR.	I love you too, Daddy.
M	FORREST	I'll be right here when you get back.
M	SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER	You understand this is the bus to school now, don't you?
M	FORREST JR.	Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris and I'm Forrest Gump.
