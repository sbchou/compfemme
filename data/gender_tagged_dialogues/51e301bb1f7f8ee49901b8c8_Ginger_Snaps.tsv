M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	GINGER	Brigitte. Quit dickin' around. Jus' do it. Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her Ginger's ten months older than me. we're seriously tight. Share everything. Everything. Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the
M	BR IG ITTE	Ready?
F	GINGER	Uh-huh.
F	BRIGITTE	.I can't. Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic.
F	BRIGITTE	You said it wouldn't hurt!
F	GINGER	Jus' hurry up! The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin.
F	BRIGITTE	Uh-oh . Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood wells up around it.
F	BRIGITTE	Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man. There's blood... Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle
F	BRIGITTE	snot funny, Ginger! Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug
F	BRIGITTE	Ali, gawd, gross. Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves.
F	GINGER	I got it, I got it. Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress.
F	GINGER	It's goin', it's goin'- gimme the ring Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but
F	GINGER	Bee?! C'mon! Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets
F	BRIGITTE	Oh, groo-oo-o-ss! The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to
F	GINGER	Bee? Feeb. Y'okay?
F	BRIGITTE	Yeah. I think so. Yeah, I think not.
F	BRIGITTE	If you din't say it hurt, I'd a been fine! Ginger beams at her new piercing.
F	GINGER	Pretty cool, unh? The flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising. Brigitte
F	BRIGITTE	very cool.
F	GINGER	Now I'll do you. Brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	We do everything together. But, at fifteen? A chick can change. Ya know? [3A! You got no idea.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	Don't get me wrong. It's not like we were all happy or nothin' to begin with. Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as -
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	The suburb of Bailey Downs? Basically a well lit black hole. The Kingdom of cul du sac. That's French for Dead End. Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves. You had a gram of personality out here? Life bit the big one. A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side pulls up a
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	Of course I'm generalizing. A tarty teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him
M	BRIGITTE (V/0)	No I'm not.
F	GINGER	The fuck, Bee. Take a picture already. Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her snap! A slide of Ginger - dead on a white picket fence - snap! Ginger sliced up with an electric knife in the kitchen, Snap! Ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room, We were always considered freaks. For as long as I can remember, there was Us. And there was Them. Like from kindergarten.
M	ART TEACHER	Very -um. Class? Comments? The students trade constipated looks.
M	ART TEACHER	Brigitte. What does it mean for you? Brigitte shrugs and squirms.
F	GINGER	Means there's more to life than -- well, li.fe. The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	Attempts at communication wore futile. JASON McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	Some of Them did seem to wanna reach Ginger? Brigitte glances from Ginger's breasts to her own flat chest.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	But nobody wanned to reach me. The bell goes.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	Like I cared. Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking
F	GINGER	Gawd, People! They hurt my brain!
F	BRIGITTE	They didn't even get it.
F	GINGER	They're retards.
F	BRIGITTE	They're cretins.
F	GINGER	They're bone-heads.
F	BRIGITTE	't'hey' re somnambulists.
F	GINGER	They're leems.
F	BRIGITTE	They're the goddamn walkin'-/ The girls stop before their locker. A folded up piece of Another one? Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper. There's a big Ginger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and
F	BRIGITTE	Somebody leaves you all. these jays an, yer not even curious to call? Ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself.
F	GINGER	No pe . A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great Brigitte and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry- Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan
M	JASON	See? She's weird, but hot.
M	TIM	Anybody poled Fitzy yet? Brigitte gives them a disgusted look.
M	TIM	Not that one. The cute one. Brigitte's face falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The
F	GINGER	Sad. Must be hard to think with yer brains slappin' around yer thighs like that all day. Brigitte laughs. Ginger pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	We didn't do guys. Guys were too gross. Everyone at Bailey High was just too incredibly gross. Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter, There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her TRINA
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	The only thing worse than most teenage boys are most teenage girls. Trinas are the limit. Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully.
F	GINGER	I feel sick.
F	BRIGITTE	Me too.
F	GINGER	No, J. mean really. Gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes. Other girls
M	BRI.GITTE (V/O)	There was really only one Trina, but they were all the same. Trina finds the Fitzgeralds' open locker door a nuisance. Ooops. Sorry. Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look. Brigitte tries to rub
F	GINGER	Y' okay's
F	BRIGITTE	I HATE her. Like to feed her ground glass with tacks for desert. Then make her puke it back up and swallow it again until she's like shredded to a bazillion pieces from the inside out... Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double.
M	BRIGITTE,	what's the matter?
F	GINGER	I got gas...Maybe I'll try an, cut one right in her face out there. They slap hands, laughing. They look down at their gym
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	After two weeks a' high school., ya come to the conclusion it's all about agony. Take Phys. Ed, sus' practise takin' pain. The gym teacher. M7.,. SYKES - an aging former-traffic cop -
F	SYKES	Field lacrosse is no pussy-assed tea party, ya get IN there, get a LOCK on your target and PUSH IT! I want SWEAT I want ACTION! The Trinas giggle at Sykes. Ginger bends forward, holding her
M	MZ.SYKES	Shake a leg, Fitzgeralds. An, butt out, you gotta death wish!?
F	GINGER	Feel really sick, Mz. Sykes.
M	MZ. SYRES	Cigarettes'll do that for you! Move! Ginger flicks the smoke at Sykes' turned back. It falls The sisters trudge to their places on the field. Ginger is on
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	Phys. Ed. is not optional at Bailey High. Sykes blows the whistle. A fast-moving, hard-hitting IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Ginger gets caught in the crunch of IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of The whistle blows and play stops. Ginger lopes over,
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	I been waiting for this. There'd been a lot of dead dogs around lately, but this was my personal first. Brigitte slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her
F	TRINA	Oh, HOW GRO-O-O-O-OSS!! Brigitte fingers the dog's remains with a look of
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	'Kay, here's the weird thing about me. I dig dead stuff. Live things make me sick, they're all warm and snotty and shitty and pissy. And live things jus' suffer, which I can't take. But a dead thing? S'kinda beautiful, 'cause a dead thing's really I dunno -like, free.
F	SYKES	Don't TOUCH it, Fitzgerald! What's WRONG with you two?! Get up and hit the SHOWERS!
M	TRINAS IN CHORUS	The cult? Drains the blood out and drinks it, ya know! /1 heard they have sex with them first ! /Gawd stop, you'll make me PUKE!
M	BRIGITTE (V/0)	Everyone was all like, Oh it's a teen cult, or aah, it's some looney, the Beast a' Bailey Downs. What crap.
F	SYKES	All RIGHT, ladies, settle! This is no joke! You have information about the dog deaths you do
M	CLASS IN CHORUS	Tell a teacher, Principal Fardor, or the police.
F	BRIGITTE	Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge', something went for its throat - it's not cut, it's chewed... Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in
F	BRIGITTE	Ginger? Sykes and the class stampede up. Sykes pushes Brigitte out
M	BRIGITTE (V/0)	Ginger's no pussy. She doesn't faint. I might faint. Like, if this pooch were only HALF-dead, I could faint. Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself.
M	FERRY	The fainting' s worrisome you don't diet do you dear?
F	GINGER	No.
M	FERRY	Hm. Anemia's very common at your age. Eat more red meat, try an iron vitamin supplement. If it happens again, straight to a proper doctor, all righty? Brigitte looks relieved.
M	FERRY	Now as for 'the headache, cramps, lower back pain .I'm guessing your period is due.
F	GINGER	I haven't got a, um, period.
M	FERRY	Never? Flow old are you?
F	GINGER	Fifteen. our mother says we're late bloomers.
M	FERRY	Well judging by your troubles, I'd say you can expect to blossom any time now! Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry produces numerous samples of
M	FERRY	Are you familiar with all these? Ginger shrugs.
M	FERRY	Now what suits one girl might not be comfortable for another. The proper form of protection is a personal choice, and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow, which naturally changes during the time you'll have your little miracle of nature. It could start thick and syrupy, move to a straight-forward basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish slime, signaling the end of the flow. Twenty-eight days later or there abouts, it'll start all over again and continue every month until menopause, in about thirty years' time. Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad
M	FERRY (CON'T)	Here's a little calendar to keep track, count from the day it starts twenty-eight days. That'll be your next time. You have any questions, come see me again. You too sweetheart, be your turn shortly, I expect. Brigitte Looks horrified. Here's a dirty word. Inevitability. That fate fully intended us to be typical in any way, sooner or later, was so insulting. Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely
F	BRIGITTE	"Some days it's all you need."-? What does that mean?
F	GINGER	So you pulled a Quincy on that dog, unh?
F	BRIGITTE	Hunh? Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket.
F	GINGER	Quincy, that guy with the stiffs on cable. Alls I remember is you goin', "Teen cult my ass".
F	BRIGITTE	Oh. Right. Well, I dunno. Brigitte shrugs. She gives Ginger a funny look.
F	GINGER	Why are you looking at me like that? Do I look - different?
F	BRIGITTE	No.
F	GINGER	Can you tell I'm going to-?
F	BRIGITTE	No. .Really. Ginger squints at her, unconvinced.
F	GINGER	Wham. Total adultness. How can I have a miracle of nature an, not be old enough to drive! fiurih? The fuck. Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard. Brigitte doesn't
F	GINGER	Hey. If I start simpin' around tampon dispensers and moanin' over cramps, or even think about buying somethin' that says Baby Powder Fresh? You'll. shoot me, right? BR TG.'i"I'L of course. They exchange grins.
F	GINGER	Out by sixteen
F	BRIGITTE	.or dead in this scene. Ginger raises her hand and Brigitte smacks it hard. As they
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	If we failed to get a life by Ginger's sixteenth birthday? we were s'posed to gas ourselves in the garage. For smart girls, we could be pretty dumb. we prob'ly never woulda done it, but we seemed to need a deadline. PAMELA (see Martha Stewart's Idea of Living), are liberal,
M	HENRY	How was school today?
F	GINGER	Fine.
M	BRIGITTE (V/U)	The nicest thing I could say about Henry and Pamela was also the meanest thing I could say.
F	PAMELA	Didn't you have a presentation? How'd it go?
F	GINGER	Fine. Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	They were easily satisfied. A rogue's gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela's
F	PAMELA	Made an appointment for you girls at my gynecologist. Next Thursday. Henry studies his plate. Ginger almost imperceptibly shakes
F	GINGER	why.
F	PAMELA	You know why.
F	GINGER	we're not going to a gynecologist.
F	PAMELA	What did I say about that tone of voice? .You are going to the gynecologist.
F	GINGER	Dad!? She's completely paranoid!
M	HENRY	I'd rather stay out of this.
F	GINGER	She's gonna have some fat jerk get his jollies poking his fingers up our ./ I'm actually eating here.
F	PAMELA	Henry, neither one of them has had a period yet.
M	HENRY	Ah. Yes. You've said. Repeatedly. As Pamela says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word
F	PAMELA	It's very odd that two perfectly healthy fifteen year olds are not menstruating. Right? Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger.
M	HENRY	Mmmm. steak's really yummy tonight. This a new sauce? The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool.
F	PAMELA	I started at eleven. The problem must be on your side, Henry.
M	HENRY	Pamela? This is not my fault. No one's at fault here.
F	PAMELA	when did your sister start?
M	HENRY	I've told you, I really have no idea. Oddly enough, we never discussed it. why don't you call her and ask her yourself?
F	PAMELA	I can't call her out of the blue and ask a thing like that. Besides, it's dinner time. They'll be eating.
M	HENRY	A--ha!
F	PAMELA	Well I've been checking panties for four years now
M	GINGER & BRIGITTE/HENRY	Mo-othe-er!!! /For chrissakes.
M	GINGER (CON'T)	You look at our underwear? Fuck!
M	HENRY	Hey, hey - I don't want to hear that word in my house. You will do as your mother says and I will change the subject. Anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence? From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off
F	BRIGITTE	Why din't you jus' tell her you're going to get it? Ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker. she
F	GINGER	Can't take her 'attention'. She grosses me out. Can't believe she's our mother. Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid
F	BRIGITTE	Yeah, but now we have to see this doctor. You can jus' say you got it, but I'm screwed. FLASH! The Polaroid spits out the front. Brigitte sticks
F	GINGER	Did I get you out of Home Ec? Did I get you out of ballet classes? So I'll get you out of this, right?
M	BR IG ITTE	You better, gawd the idea FLASH! Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and
F	GINGER	I said I will, I will. This jay's fine. Let us smoke, sister. Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She double-
F	GINGER	WHAT are you doing?
F	BRIGITTE	Look - a walrus.
F	GINGER	Hardee-har. Har. Ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window Norman the terrier's incessant barking goes on in the A plastic child's playhouse sits in their next door
F	BRIGITTE	How'l1 you know when you finally get it any ways?
F	GINGER	Prob'ly feel like peein' your pants.
F	BRIGITTE	Disgusting.
F	GINGER	Well I'm not too excited.
M	BRIGITTE,	We're missing Unsolved Mysteries.
F	GINGER	Wish I was an unsolved mystery. Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned.
F	GINGER	Hey. You smell somethin' gross?
F	GINGER	This is so not my day. Brigitte helps her to her feet. Ginger shakes what she
F	GINGER	Nice. Dog shit.
F	BRIGITTE	That isn't shit... it's death. A line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back
F	GINGER	Great. Lost the jay. Great.
F	BRIGITTE	Ack, it's still warm, gross. Brigitte takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is
F	GINGER	Why every dog but the mutt next door to us?
F	BRIGITTE	Hey, we could take it home. Try like, an autopsy. Like, crack the case!
F	GINGER	Nah. Let's put ' im in there so he won't. Lraumatize the kiddies. Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the They trot the dog over to the dumpster. Brigitte sulks.
F	GINGER	What.
F	BRIGITTE	We never do what I wanna do.
F	GINGER	Oh, c' mon. Would stink up the whole room! They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It's hind Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.
F	GINGER	Nice. Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand. More appears. She
F	GINGER	Bee. I JUST got the curse. Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog.
F	BRIGITTE	Serious? Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her.
F	GINGER	We gotta go home.
F	BRIGITTE	Eeew, 'kay. Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank Something is crunching through the leaves toward them. Ginger Hurry upt
F	BRIGITTE	I'm stuck3 A few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp
F	GINGER	Bee?: Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail. Brigitte tears her
F	GINGER	Let's go this way. Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank
F	BRIGITTE	This is stupid. We're getting farther from home. Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their
F	GINGER	All right you ass-/ She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth
M	BRIGITTE/GINGER!!!	Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature. Ginger raises her
M	BEEEEEI HELP MEEE! BEEEEE!!!1!	Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails. Brigitte The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off,
F	GINGER	Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!! Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell.. for a main At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars. The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck. There is Then a sickening thud. Brakes squeal incto a stop as a Sam slowly opens the cab door. He staggers to the bloody He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore Then Sam vomits. Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down
F	BRIGITTE	Ginger, shit! Ginger looks at herself. Ginger starts to cry.
F	GINGER	The fuck was that, Bee? I couldn't remember Ginger crying, ever. Brigitte flies out to, Brigitte offers Ginger the wet cloth, but Ginger's helpless.
F	BRIGITTE	Ginger, sshhh, don't, 'kay. Don't cry. Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger's arms with it,
F	BRIGITTE	Okay, this is really bad. You need a doctor, Ginge', I can't stop all the -/

F	BRIGITTE	What if you get, sick? What if these bites get infected?

F	BRIGITTE	Fine! I won't tell! Brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on
F	GINGER	Wanted to kill me! I could tell.
F	BRIGITTE	I know, I know. I was so scared, I thought you were -/
F	GINGER	Me too. Don't say it. I know. Brigitte lights her smoke for her. Ginger takes a drag and
F	GINGER	Fuck. You okay? Brigitte resumes her first aid.
M	BR IG ITTE	Yeah, I'm okay.
F	GINGER	Why!?? Why me?
F	BRIGITTE	It was crazy, it was like rabid or somethin' -- Shit, look at the size of these bites!
F	GINGER	I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. Right? It's okay. Brigitte doesn't look convinced. Brigitte snaps the port of

M	BR IG ITTE	No! Geez, I was jus', whatever. A heavy silence falls between them. Brigitte keeps working.

F	BRIGITTE	Me too, Ginge'.
M	BRIGITTE (V/O)	I woke up later, I thought the thing was in our room. Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out
M	BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)	Then I remembered Sam the tree planter killed it with his truck, an' we were okay. .But really, Ginger -? well. Wasn't.
F	BRIGITTE	Gonna eat that? Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages. Brigitte

M	JASON	Watcha got for us? Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise.
M	SAM	New harvest, see whatcha think. What's your problem? Never seen a pretty girl before? Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth.

F	BRIGITTE	That smoke fucked me _up._ up. Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo,
