M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MR AARON	Abrams... Allende... One after the other the students get up to collect their On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her Bernstein... Cohen... At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk.
F	LISA	Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"
M	MR AARON	Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute. Sure.
M	MR AARON	Now...I know you had a little help...
F	LISA	Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean.
M	MR AARON	I'm just saying I know you had a little help.
F	LISA	A lot of people did.
M	MR AARON	Be that as it may --
F	LISA	I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life...
M	MR AARON	Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest in?
F	LISA	Um, no, not really. Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big difference-between using a book and like, I don't know, using somebody else's mind who's like, really good at math? It's not like this person did the whole test for me.
M	MR AARON	Oh no?
F	LISA	No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.
M	MR AARON	Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK?
F	LISA	You are so fair.
F	BECKY	What did he say to you?
F	LISA	Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	He is so appealing. A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier
M	KIRSTEN	OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.
M	KURT	What'd he do, call on you?
M	KIRSTEN	Fuck you., Kurt.
F	LESLIE	Kirsten is really upset.
M	KURT	I'm sorry. Let me have one of those, will you? Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her.
F	BECKY	Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.
M	KIRSTEN	I don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie) Check out what he. said to me last week. She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa
F	LESLIE	Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to
F	MONICA	.I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.
M	KLEIN	.So the President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike, and they went out there and shot them down! Just like they did in Virginia, just like they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did not care! They did not care!
M	LEWIS	And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say.
M	KLEIN	All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.
F	BECKY	Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students.
M	KLEIN	I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good President?
M	LIONEL	Um...I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt.
M	- LEWIS	Lisa?
F	LISA	Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.
M	ANTHONY	Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class.
M	DARREN	Hey, how'd you do?
F	LISA	Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so much.
M	DARREN	So he didn't give you a hard time or anything?
F	LISA	Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything...He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
M	DARREN	Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.
F	LISA	What's that supposed to mean?
M	DARREN	Nothing. The man is very lovable. They stop at the corner. What are you doing now?
F	LISA	I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.
M	DARREN	Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?
F	LISA	Because my Dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to go horseback riding, and I don't think it would be right to appear on horseback in New Mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You wouldn't understand these things.
M	DARREN	That is a definite possibility.
F	LISA	Anyway... Thanks again...
M	DARREN	Before you venture forth on your bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...?
F	LISA	Yes, Darren?
M	DARREN	.what are you up to later? Like tonight.
F	LISA	I don't know.
M	DARREN	You wanna go to a movie?
F	LISA	What do you mean, like on a date?
M	DARREN	No, not on a date, just go to amovie. I don't know if it's a fucking date!
F	LISA	All right. Calm down. What do you wanna see?
M	DARREN	I don't know, I don't even know what's playing! I don't know if it's a date! Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin' movies anyway. They're just bullshit.
F	LISA	OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm sorry!
M	DARREN	What if it was a date, anyway? Would that
F	LISA	Oh my God. Are you like -- are you asking me out? (Pause) Are you? (Pause) Hello...? Earth to Darren.
M	DARREN	I don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like we're already really close...
F	LISA	Oh my God...
M	DARREN	.and I think we'd be a really good match - - What?
F	LISA	Nothing. This is -- Nothing.
M	DARREN	So -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.
F	LISA	Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship.
M	DARREN	I view this as a way of strengthening our friendship.
F	LISA	It would definitely change it...
M	DARREN	I know: It's a fairly dangerous move.
F	LISA	Well...I would definitely have to think about this...
M	DARREN	Absolutely. Give it some thought.
F	LISA	OK, I will. Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Why do you look like that?
M	DARREN	Like what?
F	LISA	What do you want from me?
M	DARREN	Not a thing!
F	LISA	All right. I'll see you later.
M	DARREN	All right. She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.
F	LISA	Hello...! Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the
M	CURTIS	Hi.
F	LISA	Is Mom home?
M	CURTIS	She went to the store. Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.
M	CURTIS (CONT'D)	Use a plate.
F	LISA	Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two- shoes. -
M	CURTIS	Fuck you.
F	LISA	Please don't say "fuck," Curtis.
M	CURTIS	You just said it.
F	LISA	Yeah, that's because I know what it means.
M	CURTIS	So do I.
F	LISA	Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for it.
M	CURTIS	What does it mean? She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.
F	LISA	It's when a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body. Pause.
M	CURTIS	No it's not.
F	LISA	Yes it is.
M	CURTIS	Gross. It is gross. She eats. He watches her.
M	CURTIS	Do you want to play a game?
F	LISA	No.
M	CURTIS	Please!
F	LISA	I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging me.
M	CURTIS	Can I have some pizza? She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together.
F	LISA	What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: Darren wants me to go to the movies with him. You want to come? I guess around eight? Hey! The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it. IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and

M	MITCHELL	OK, Lisa? Lisa? I just want to ask you a couple of questions, OK?
F	LISA	OK, sure.
M	MITCHELL	Now I want to ask you where you-were, and what you saw when the accident took place. Just tell me everything you saw, even if you think it might not be important. OK? Think of it like a movie. Like you're watchin' a movie in your head, and all you gotta do is tell me exactly what you see in the movie. OK?

F	LISA	I understand! I don't mind, I'm just upset!
M	MITCHELL	OK, Lisa, hang in there. You're doin' great.
F	LISA	Could somebody call my mother?
M	MITCHELL	We already called your Mom; but I'm gonna have 'em put another call into your mother right now, OK?
F	LISA	Yes. Please stop patronizing me.
M	MITCHELL	I'm not tryin' to patronize you. I'm just tryin' to get the information down while these questions might seem like they don't make a lotta sense right now --
F	LISA	They do make sense. Just ask me!
M	MITCHELL	Well, that's what I'm doin'. Now: I'm gonna ask you: From where you're standing could you see the traffic light? (Pause) Could you see if it was red? Green? Yellow? Just picture it in your mind. What color was the light? Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her.
F	LISA	I guess it was green? I didn't really see it. I think it was just an accident.

M	CURTIS	What did they do with her leg?
F	LISA	I have no fucking idea.
F	JOAN	Hey. Come on...
F	JOAN	Lisa? Are you sure you don't want me to call in...?

M	RAMON	Yes, two times.
F	JOAN	Gosh. That's very -- That's a lot!
M	RAMON	Oh no. It's a beautiful performance. And I think it's still in previews...?
F	JOAN	Yeah, we're on kind of a weird schedule...
M	RAMON	I think you will have a big success.
F	JOAN	Well, at the moment we're just trying to focus on what we're doing...
M	RAMON	I don't know if you are busy, but will you allow me to -buy you a drink? There's a place right down the street... If you like to ask your friends... or if you didn't eat dinner... Joan sees Lisa sitting across the room waiting.
F	JOAN	Oh -- No -- thank you. I can't. I'm just on my way home. 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 23A
M	RAMON	OK, it's no problem. Tomorrow I'm going to London for a few days on business. Perhaps when I come back...

F	LISA	Go out with him.
F	JOAN	You think?
F	LISA	Um, yeah...! Ramon disappears up the stairs. Joan and Lisa look at each
F	JOAN	Hi, sweetie... !
F	LISA	She kisses and hugs Lisa, squashing her a little. Lisa gets Do Shirley Temple! Shirley Temple! Joan does a very excellent Shirley Temple imitation.
F	LISA	'Bye Mom.

M	JOHN	Matthew, if you would read France... And Anthony, you read Burgundy...
M	ANTHONY	Ah. Burgundy.
M	JOHN	And I guess I'm gonna hog the part of Lear again...
M	ANTHONY	"Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness Offer'd, nor will you tender less."
M	JOHN	"Right, noble Burgundy, so; But now her price is fall'n."
M	DARREN	If you didn't want to go to the movies alone with-me Friday, you could have just told me that. You didn't need to bring Becky along as your bodyguard.
F	LISA	I didn't bring her as a bodyguard.
M	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1	Oh, he's wonderful. He drives all the way to see her every Saturday.
M	DARREN	Then why did you?
M	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 LISA	That's a long drive. I forgot I told Becky I would do something with her NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Friday night, so I invited You know he has three sisters? her along. I didn't think They haven't spoken in four- whole relationship. NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 What relationship? You don't say.
F	LISA	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 What are you muttering? Oh that whole family's crazy.
M	DARREN	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 Nothing. I'll try to Fourteen years! improve my diction. (Pause) What's the matter?
M	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1	And she has a little dog that LISA used to belong to the father, Nothing. very ugly face. But does she love that dog.

M	DARREN	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Like what? Who's gonna steal him?
F	LISA	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything. That's what I said.
M	DARREN	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 But what specifically is What's the name of it? fucked up? It's called a bull terrier. Nothing.
M	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2	No, what's the name of the dog?
M	NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1	Barnaby. The two ladies keep on talking.
F	LISA	So...I've been thinking about your suggestion...
M	DARREN	Uh huh...?
F	LISA	I guess I_don't think it's a very good idea.
M	DARREN	Why not?
F	LISA	I guess I don't feel that way about you.
M	DARREN	But those kinds of feelings can develop. I definitely feel like there's a connection there. I know there is.
M	DARREN	I just think you're scared. I'think you're scared of your own feelings. I think you've been hurt in the past by other guys and I think what it would feel like to have a real feeling is really terrifying to you.
M	DARREN (CONT'D)	What's the matter? (Pause) What's the matter?
M	RAMON	My family are from Colombia... My.father worked in the diplomatic service...
F	JOAN	Really. Wow.
M	RAMON	I grew up five years in Panama, four years in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After I finish university, I moved back to Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French, they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking Spanish, they think I'm french.
F	JOAN	And what do you do, Ramon?
M	RAMON	I have a company: We design computer software to help companies in South American countries.that use an incompatible software, so the computers can't talk to each other. It's a big problem in Central and South America, where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications. So right now there's a big opportunity for us, because for the big software companies it's still in the backwoods. That's changing already, but in the last ten years we have done extremely well. It's the next ten years we're going to see what happens.
F	JOAN	Uh huh? God...
M	RAMON	Can I give you a lift?
F	JOAN	Oh -- no -- Thank you, I'm just gonna grab a cab, but thank you.
M	RAMON	May I call you sometime?
F	JOAN	OK, sure, that would be great. Pause.
M	RAMON	May I have your telephone number?
F	JOAN	Oh my God, I'm sorry, of course. Duh! Hold on a minute: Do you have a pen? Ramon takes out his cell phone.
M	RAMON	What's the number?
F	JOAN	Um -- 212...
F	LISA	Mom...? Just a second!
F	LISA	Can I come in?
F	JOAN	Just one second, honey. Hold on! (covering herself up) Come in. Lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed.
F	LISA	Can I talk to you?
F	JOAN	Sure. What's up.
F	LISA	How was the show...?
F	JOAN	It was OK. Are you all right?
F	LISA	Not really.
F	JOAN	What's wrong?
F	LISA	Mom...I have to tell you something.
F	LISA	So what do you think I should do?
F	JOAN	Well...it doesn't sound like it was anybody's fault...
F	LISA	But don't you think I should say something to them now?
F	JOAN	I don't know, sweetie. I mean, that bus driver probably has a family to support .He could probably lose his job...So I think you should really think about that before you say anything ... You might end up feeling even worse... Lisa was not expecting this response and doesn't like it. Joan isn't sure what she's done wrong. Think of the implications of what you're saying!
M	KLEIN	.I'm saying what is the frame of reference for the average Arab on the street? Angie!
F	ANGIE	Yeah, my family is from Syria? And I just want to say that Americans have no idea how much people hate them all over the world. OK?
F	BECKY	We don't?
F	ANGIE	And all my relatives in Syria think that what we did in Afghanistan was terrorism. Not to mention Iraq...
M	ANTHONY	Syria is a theocratic military dictatorship.
F	ANGIE	Um, no it's not: Sorry.
M	ANTHONY	Syria is not a theocratic military dictatorship?
F	LISA	Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually, Angie.
F	ANGIE	No we don't.
M	LEWIS	One at a time --
F	LISA	They blew up our city, OK? So yeah, I think we have a pretty good idea, and personally I don't give a shit. There is some laughter from the class.
F	ANGIE	You should! 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 31
F	LISA	-- because the people who blew up the World Trade Center were a bunch of sick monsters -
F	ANGIE	Oh they were monsters?
F	LISA	Yes!
F	ANGIE	Why? Because they're Arabs?
F	LISA	No, because they killed three thousand people for no reason.
M	KLEIN	Hey, hey, one at a time...!
F	ANGIE	Maybe they think they had a reason!
M	KLEIN	LISA Hey, hey, hey! Like what? They didn't even have any demands! ANGIE They just wanted to kill Why did we drop bombs people! on innocent people in Afghanistan? We're still What do you think we doing it! Why did we should've have done? invade Iraq? They don't care about Because, they declared war civilian casualties! And on us, Angie! Iraq has nothing to do with Afghanistan! It has to do with ANGIE oil! No they didn't! Iraq didn't declare war on LEWIS anybody! They didn't co Come on guys, one at a time! anything to us! Anthony.
M	ANTHONY	They did have a reason.
F	ANGIE	Thank you.
M	ANTHONY	They want to establish a medieval Islamic caliphat in the Middle East and destroy Western civilization.
F	ANGIE	Oh, where did you read that?
M	ANTHONY	It's on their website.
F	ANGIE	Okay, forget it.
M	KLEIN	Angie!
F	ANGIE	No! Forget it!
M	KLEIN	Go ahead with what you were saying!
F	ANGIE	No! Why should I? Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 32
F	LISA	But why are you defending somebody who murdered three thousand people!
F	ANGIE	I'm not! Why are you defending a country that unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries and supports the Israeli occupation of Palestine?! The class ROARS.
F	LISA	Oh give me a break!
F	ANGIE	-- and drops bombs on women and children and then calls other people terrorists for doing the exact same thing!
M	KLEIN LISA	OK -- OK -- Because it's not same thing!
F	ANGIE	Yes it is!
M	KLEIN	Lionel! Go ahead.
M	LIONEL	Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop bombs on women and children? Isn't that just reverse sexism?
M	KLEIN	I don't know. That's an interesting point. I agree it's a bullshit term.
F	LISA	This is totally stupid.
M	KLEIN	Uhhhhhh...Monica!
F	MONICA	Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture --
F	ANGIE	Thank you! 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 33
F	MONICA	-- and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!
F	LISA	They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces!
M	MONICA ANGIE	Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs -- bombs on the Ku Klux Klan? LISA Because they're white? Yes! No! The Taliban! Do you wish they were LIONEL still there? There's six people with their hands raised before ANTHONY you, Lisa! The correct term is Afghans. But I'm not even saying I disagree with you! I'm only saying I think it's pathetic the way people in this class treated Angie just for saying something they don't agree with.
M	KLEIN	Because that's censorship, right? Right?
M	MONICA LISA	Yeah! (a joke:) Right on! It's not censorship...! This class is not the ANGIE government! Thank you... !
M	ANTHONY	That's not technically LEWIS true. It's censorship.
F	LISA	Oh my God, no it's not!
F	JOAN	Ready?
M	MITCHELL	We actually work outta Highway One? Up in the Bronx? So for somethin' like this we just borrow a local precinct...
F	JOAN	Uh huh...
M	- MITCHELL	Would you say you had a clear line of vision?
F	LISA	Yes.
M	MITCHELL	OK, just describe what you saw to me in your own words? Lisa glances at Joan. Joan smiles at her encouragingly.
F	LISA	She just stepped out in the street? How are you?
M	KARL	I'm great. I'm looking at a beautiful sunset over the ocean. Doing a little work. . .How are you?
F	LISA	I'm OK.
M	KARL	Practicing your horseback riding? Oh yeah, I'm really riding a lot. I'm gettin' these really bad saddle sores.
M	_ KARL	OK. Well. I would actually seriously recommend you go over to, uh, to Claremont Stables and see about getting some lessons.
F	LISA	No, I was actually really thinking about doing that...
M	KARL	So how's everything going? How's school?
F	LISA	School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in geometry...
F	LISA	But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious...
M	KARL	Yeah. Math was never my strong suit either.
F	LISA	Well, I am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard-How are you?
M	KARL	I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a little bit, which is good. How's the boyfriend situation?
F	LISA	Oh the same. They're all kind of the same.
M	KARL	Uh huh? Well, next time you come out here I'll try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment.
F	LISA	Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the California type.
M	KARL	Well -- I don't either, per se. It
F	LISA	Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop generalizing,now...!
M	KARL	OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your Mom. OK, I can't wait for our trip. Yeah. I think we're gonna have a really
M	LISA KARL	OK. Well, I love you. .It's gonna be really fun. Um -- Love you too.
F	LISA	Bye Dad.
M	KARL	Bye sweetie.
F	JOAN	It's true. Two years of college. Two years
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	(Bursts into tears) I'm kind of a two-year gal...! IN THE LAUGHING AUDIENCE -- Lisa watches, unamused.
F	JOAN	What did you think of the play?
F	LISA	It was OK. Silence.
M	- JOAN	Well, thank you, honey.
F	LISA	What do you want me to say? JOAN I thought it was OK! Nothing! You said it! Next time I'll lie!
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	Don't come next time!
F	LISA	I won't!
F	PAUL	Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I would be doing exactly what I'm doing right now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd just be acting, except I wouldn't do anything differently from how I'm doing it right now. Nearby, BECKY and LISA are looking at a poster for "Guys and
F	BECKY	I still don't get why you didn't even audition. You're such a good singer.
F	LISA	I still might do lights or something. But I'm not gonna make a fuckin' ass out of myself parading around in a play so I can ask everyone how great I was for three years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother.
F	LISA	Did I tell you guys I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus?
M	GIRLS	What? Really? Are you kidding?
F	LISA	Check out my boots.
M	GIRLS	Oh my God! What happened? Where were you? What did you see, etc?
F	JOAN	You do know I have two kids, right?
M	RAMON	Yes. I'd like to meet them.
F	JOAN	You are really smooth.
M	RAMON	I would love to meet your kids. I have two boys myself. I'm not smooth. (Pause) Would you like to have a nightcap?
F	JOAN	Oh, God.
F	BECKY	Are you aware that things have gotten to the point where I now have to hear things about you from other people and I can't even correct them because I no longer have any first-hand information about you myself?
F	LISA	What are you talking about?
F	BECKY	Nothing. I just feel like we used to be really close -- like, up until a few days ago. And I'm not really getting that from you anymore.
F	LISA	Becky. Give me a break. Pause.
F	BECKY	I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response?
F	LISA	Can we just go please? Fine. Would you like to smoke any more of my pot before we leave or have you had as much as you want now? Oh, I'd like to have a little bit more please.
F	BECKY	Fine. Get fuckin' out of my house!
F	LISA	Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party.
F	LISA	It's very hard to be cool under these circumstances.
F	PAUL	You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose.
F	LISA	I'll try...! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.
F	PAUL	And then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical. Very important. She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Symmetry.
F	LISA	do now?
F	PAUL	Now we make out.
F	LISA	Paul...! What about your girlfriend?
F	PAUL	I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend.
F	LISA	Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She
F	PAUL	You're not serious.
F	LISA	Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him.
F	LISA	Hey... You know I really love you, right?
M	DARREN	Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.
F	LISA	I guess I'm not very consistent.
M	DARREN	I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.
M	- LISA	I gotta go home.
M	RAMON (O.C.)	Joan? Are you all right?
F	JOAN	Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror,
M	MR AARON	Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa?
F	LISA	Are you still mad at me about the test?
M	MR AARON	What's going on, Lisa?
F	LISA	.Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place.
M	MR AARON	What does your being rich have to do with anything?
F	LISA	You know what I mean.
M	- MR AARON	No, I don't.
F	LISA	Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver.
M	MR AARON	OK...But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed.
F	LISA	Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door.
M	MR AARON	Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.
M	LIONEL	I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe.
M	MR AARON	You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door.
M	MR AARON (CONT'D)	All right: I have to let those guys in. I don't want to leave you hanging...If you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup of coffee after school...
F	LISA	I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little.
F	JOAN	Does this-make me look fat?
F	LISA	Um, a little.
F	JOAN	Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
F	LISA	Where are you going?
F	JOAN	The opera...!
F	LISA	Why are you going to the opera?
F	JOAN	It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime.
F	LISA	Uh, no thanks.
F	JOAN	Why not? I bet you'd like it.
F	LISA	I don't like that kind of singing.
F	JOAN	But you like classical music.
F	LISA	Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing.
M	JOAN LISA	But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting.
F	JOAN	Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
F	LISA	OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it.
F	JOAN	What is the matter with you?
F	LISA	Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera!
F	JOAN	Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No thanks!"
F	LISA	I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times!
F	JOAN	OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon.
F	LISA	Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think.
F	JOAN	Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that?
F	LISA	I guess you would. Withdrawn.
F	JOAN	Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you?
F	LISA	Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!
F	JOAN	Here: you be me, and say anything, and I'll respond the way you've been responding to me this whole conversation.
F	LISA	No...!
F	JOAN	Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me -- Why not?
F	LISA	Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your point! "OK, uh, whatever."
F	LISA	Was that supposed to be an imitation of me? "Um, OK: Withdrawn."
F	LISA	Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own family. Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.
F	JOAN	Are you coming to my opening night?
F	LISA	I will if I have to. Pause.
F	JOAN	You're a little cunt, do you know that?
F	LISA	Yes. You're a big cunt.
F	JOAN	OK. Let's not start talking to each other that way.
F	LISA	You just called me a cunt, Mom!
F	JOAN	OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!
F	JOAN	-- If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me -- and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say --!
F	LISA	Not really.
F	JOAN	if you're saying you're completely unaware of that, then I have to say I don't think you're being honest about it. Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him -- whether you think I should be or not! -- you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father --
F	LISA	Oh my God!
F	JOAN	-- which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa, ever since I told you about Ramon you've been treating me like I'm insane!
F	LISA	Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.
F	JOAN	Now what am I supposed to do?!
F	LISA	Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week --
F	JOAN	I never go out with anyone! LISA Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care! I've barely had a date in the last two years!
M	LISA (CONT'D)	But I don't care about any of this! It doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't matter! Your play doesn't matter, except to you! I don't care about New Mexico, because to tell you the truth I'm probably not even going --
F	JOAN	What do you mean?
F	LISA	-- and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in whole city out there full of people who are dying! So who cares if I like your fucking boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you bothering me about all this? It doesn't matter!!!
F	JOAN	Well -- should I have him come up now? Or should I have him wait downstairs...?
F	LISA	Do whatever you want. I don't care!
F	JOAN	I don't even know what we're talking about.
F	LISA	I know you don't. That's the problem.
F	JOAN	Oh give me a break.
M	RAMON	Everything is all right?
F	JOAN	Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the opera! I don't think I've really gone more than one or two times!
M	RAMON	Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still fun to go. What if we just went to see something else instead?
M	RAMON	You don't want to hear Norma?
F	JOAN	No -- I don't mean that. I just meant wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events, like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play instead.
M	RAMON	I think you will enjoy this.
F	JOAN	It's beautiful...!
M	RAMON	Shhh.
F	PAUL	Yo.
F	LISA	Hey, Paul. Goldenrod Revised 10/23/05 - Page 49
F	PAUL	Hey.
F	LISA	It's Lisa Cohen.
F	PAUL	Yeah, how's it going?
F	LISA	OK. (Pause) What have you been up to?
F	PAUL	Seeing some questionable movies. Not deciding where to go to college...
F	LISA	Sounds good...(Pause) So...I was just thinking...This is gonna sound really queer, but...by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my virginity?
F	PAUL	Um...all right.
F	LISA	Really? God, I'm so flattered.
F	PAUL	To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?
F	LISA	Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul.
F	PAUL	So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there...?
F	LISA	Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home.
F	PAUL	All right. (Pause) Do you want to give me your address?
F	LISA	It's 252 West 85th Street...
F	LISA	Hello?
M	DARREN	Hey. What are you up to?
F	LISA	Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.
M	DARREN	Really? That's impressive.
F	LISA	Not really.
M	DARREN	I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before.
F	LISA	Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.
M	DARREN	You're not gonna fail Humanities.
F	LISA	No, probably not.
M	DARREN	So what did you do tonight?
F	LISA	Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause.
M	DARREN	Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
M	DARKEN	OK, bye. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 50A Bye. Darren hangs up and starts crying.
F	PAUL	Hey.
F	LISA	Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.
F	PAUL	I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.
F	LISA	Oh really? What did they say?
F	PAUL	She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator.
F	LISA	That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room...
M	LISA (CONT'D)	So this is the living room.
F	PAUL	Very livable.
F	LISA	We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way.
F	PAUL	Have you?
F	LISA	Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.
F	PAUL	This book is a very cool book.
F	LISA	Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now.
F	PAUL	It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. -
F	LISA	Do you want anything to drink?
F	PAUL	I'd take a beer.
F	LISA	OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. -
F	PAUL	Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter.
F	LISA	Thanks.
F	PAUL	Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.
F	LISA	Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it.
F	PAUL	Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"
F	LISA	How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny.
F	PAUL	It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer.
F	LISA	So...do you want to see my room?
F	PAUL	Sure.
F	LISA	This is my room. Ta da.
F	PAUL	Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.
F	LISA	And these are my stuffed animals.
F	PAUL	Always important to meet the stuffed animals.
F	LISA	These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right?
F	PAUL	I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
F	LISA	Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always really liked it... He looks at her pictures. So...can I ask you a question?
F	PAUL	Yes?
F	LISA	This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you? (Pause) OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally
F	PAUL	Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's basically like, the world's greatest getting nervous about.
F	LISA	Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel. Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about, it's this. But maybe that's just really idealistic of me.
F	PAUL	There is that philosophy.
F	LISA	You are so funny...!
F	PAUL	Do you have an ashtray?
F	LISA	Oh you can just chuck it out the window.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Are we starting?
F	PAUL	I was thinking about it, yeah.
F	LISA	And am I being really dorky right now?
F	PAUL	You're not suave.
F	LISA	I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please ignore.
F	PAUL	Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna be a great experience for you. You're gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms at least. He kisses her. They make out.
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	OK, let's talk about your kissing. Don't panic. It's just a technical thing. Lisa collapses with her face in the bed out of shame.
F	LISA	What are you like the nicest guy in the world?
F	PAUL	No...
F	LISA	Like that?
F	PAUL	Yes...
F	LISA	in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something?
F	PAUL	Yeah, but we're gonna move on before He shifts around and tries to go down on her.
F	LISA	You don't have to do that.
F	PAUL	I know. I want to.
F	LISA	Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed. Let me do it to you.
F	PAUL	All right.
F	PAUL	Are you ready?
F	LISA	Yeah.
F	PAUL	OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably gonna hurt a little, at first, but then it's gonna get better...Just be patient. There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it's not gonna happen.
F	LISA	OK: You sound insane. They laugh.
F	PAUL	OK, ready? Yeah. Mm hm.
F	PAUL	OK, hang on...
F	LISA	Ow!
F	PAUL	OK -- There we go. Does it hurt now?
F	LISA	Kind of, yeah.
F	PAUL	OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in a second...
F	LISA	Did you bring a condom?
F	PAUL	Uh huh...
F	LISA	Shouldn't you put it on?
F	PAUL	I will in a second.
F	LISA	This is really kind of hurting.
F	PAUL	OK -- one second.
F	LISA	I love you.
F	PAUL	What?
F	LISA	Nothing.
F	PAUL	OK -- hold on -- Shit --
F	LISA	What?
F	PAUL	OK, one second -- Ohh! Sorry -- Sorry --
M	PAUL (CONT'D)	Sorry about that. Kind of got away from me.
F	LISA	Did any of it get inside me?
F	PAUL	I don't know. Yeah. It definitely did.
F	PAUL	Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings.
F	LISA	That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Hi, Curtis.
M	CURTIS	Hi. We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has
F	PAUL	Hey.
F	LISA	Hey. (sits down) Can I have a drag? (takes a drag of his cigarette) Thanks.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	mad at you...
F	PAUL	Why? (Pause) Why? (Pause) Because we didn't use birth control?
F	LISA	I guess so.
F	PAUL	It was at the ready...
F	LISA	Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day. Didn't you ever hear of the "Morning After
F	LISA	Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill?
F	PAUL	Well...that's the Canadian name.
F	LISA	Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...!
F	PAUL	Try to listen to me. Right about now is when you're traditionally supposed to freak out. So why don't you just not? You're not gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS --
F	LISA	How do you know? Have you been tested?
F	PAUL	No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one.
F	LISA	I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions. (Pause) Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me.
F	PAUL	You're welcome.
F	LISA	Did it freak you out that I said I love you?
F	PAUL	No...It didn't freak me out.
F	LISA	You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me.
F	PAUL	I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you.
F	LISA	You should probably go now...
F	PAUL	Yo.
F	LISA	That's my brother.
F	PAUL	What's up?
M	CURTIS	Hi. Lisa walks Paul to the front door. She washes her face and brushes her teeth.
F	JOAN	Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting!
M	RAMON '	Good! We should go again!
F	JOAN	But how about those people yelling "Bravi!" and "Brava!"
M	RAMON	How do you mean?
F	JOAN	It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!" Why can't they just say "Bravo?"
M	RAMON	Well, it's the plural.
F	JOAN	I know --
M	RAMON	It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble.
F	JOAN	No, I know, I know it's correct, it just -- don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people?
M	RAMON	Pretentious?
F	JOAN	I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it...But you know how you can really be enjoying something -- but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye -- because you know people are watching you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at all?
M	RAMON	Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
F	JOAN	Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean.
M	RAMON	You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer.
F	JOAN	Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
M	RAMON	We'll have to go again.
F	JOAN	It was so glamorous...! "My time of day is the dark time..."
F	LISA	Cue thirty-six, go.
M	GARY THE THEATER TEACHER (O.C.)	OK, hold up a second. OK, we're gonna do that one more time please. Let's back it up please...
M	MATTHEW	Why are we stopping?
M	GARY	Now I know there's been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this room..But I wanna tell you something: You've worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of bullshit I know has been going on around here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one person working on this show who hasn't got somebody they want to say something to, including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew? By "Matthew," I assume you mean me?
M	GARY	Yes. I mean you. Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.
M	MATTHEW	Yes?
M	GARY	You are probably one of the most talented kids who's ever performed at this school. But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you can just waltz through this part, and it's pissing me off. Because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines. OK? _
M	MATTHEW	So you'd like me to memorize them. Everyone laughs.
M	GARY	Yes, I'd like you to memorize them! Now. (Brightly) Your turn!
M	MATTHEW	But I'm not mad at anyone. I just want everyone to think I'm a great guy. Everyone laughs.
F	LISA	But I'm jealous of you...
F	BECKY	Why would you be jealous of me...!
F	LISA	Because of everything! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money, and your parents are still together, and I'm really jealous of your other friends!
F	BECKY	Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!
F	LISA	Me too! They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Darren...? Darren unglues himself from his perch on a table, and sits in
M	LISA (CONT'D)	I know that I'm not who you want me to be to you. And I know how much I've hurt you. But I still can't believe it means we can't be friends anymore! So much has been happening to me this semester -- I know. I know. -- and it's like I can't even talk to you about it because I hurt you so bad!
M	DARREN	Yes you can. Of course you can. You can talk to me about anything.
F	LISA	I don't love anybody more than you! You're practically my best friend!
M	DARREN	I love you too. I really do...! They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.
M	GARY	Leslie?
F	LESLIE	Can I just say, I think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing, and if we could all just work together, instead of being AT each other all the time, I think we could all just be incredible. Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.
F	ANGIE	Yeah. (Long pause) Yeah. I'm gonna say it. I feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about them. And I think I speak for a lot of the techies when I say that I feel really unappreciated and basically fucked over. And I don't know if I can get over it. I don't. That's all. Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty
M	GARY	Yes, Paul?
F	PAUL	Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you know? This is hicrh school. You know? I don't really feel a strong need to like, all be on the same team with everybody. I just want to come to rehearsals, do the show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot, and then like, go on home. I don't really wanna cry and hug anybody. There are laughs and some cheers.
M	GARY	Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you Paul?
F	PAUL	OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug. No kissin' though. Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps. Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He ACCIDENT. Monica Patterson, a long-time Upper West Sider, was struck by and killed by a city bus Friday afternoon on Broadway. The bus driver, Gerald Maretti, was not at fault, police said... Lisa is on-the phone. Curtis is watching TV. Accident Investigation. Detective Mitchell.
F	LISA	Hi, my name-is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago...
M	MITCHELL	Yeah, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?
F	LISA	Well, this is probably gonna sound a little weird, but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that woman's family? I'm obviously probably too late to go to the funeral, but I really wanted to send some flowers or something.
M	MITCHELL	Yeah, I can --
F	LISA	Or is that like classified information?
M	MITCHELL	No no. Family's been notified...Lemme see what I got.
F	LISA	She mentioned she had a daughter...
M	MITCHELL	Lemme just... OK: I don't have anything for a daughter. The only contact I have is a cousin, Abigail Berwitz. I got a number in Arizona...
F	LISA	So did you have the trial, or whatever? Or did you make the -- did they have a ruling yet?
M	MITCHELL	Yes. It was, uh, No Criminality found.
F	LISA	No Criminality.
M	MITCHELL	Right.
F	LISA	Wow. That's a -- great system you got. OK. Wow.
F	LISA	Yeah.
F	LISA	Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz?
F	ABIGAIL	This is Abigail.
F	LISA	Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I...
F	ABIGAIL	Yes? Hello?
F	LISA	Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson?
F	LISA	I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died...
F	LISA	Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time...
F	ABIGAIL	Yes? What can I do for you?
F	LISA	OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because -- No. As far as I know they're doing something or other next week. But --
F	LISA	I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter?
M	ABIGAIL LISA	No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago.
F	LISA	Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was
F	ABIGAIL	She had leukemia.
F	LISA	Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa?
F	ABIGAIL	Yes...?
F	LISA	OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought --
F	ABIGAIL	Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number?
F	LISA	Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to -- Well they really shouldn't be giving out my number. (blurts out) This is harassment! I'm sorry! -I'm not trying to harass
F	ABIGAIL	I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me.
F	LISA	I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to
F	ABIGAIL	Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop.
F	LISA	Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
F	ABIGAIL	Yes, all right.
F	EMILY	I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine...
F	LISA	Oh so was she a lawyer?
F	EMILY	Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers.
F	LISA	Were you really good friends with her?
F	EMILY	Yes I was.
F	JOAN	Where you going, sweetie?
F	LISA	I'm going to that woman's funeral.
F	JOAN	Are you sure you don't want me to come?
F	LISA	Why? I don't even know her.
F	JOAN	I would be coming for you.
F	EMILY	Hi. Are you Lisa?
F	LISA	Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come.
F	EMILY	Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink?
F	LISA	Oh -- Um -- no thanks.
F	EMILY	We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres.
F	LISA	Oh - that's quite all right, thank you.
F	EMILY	Well-thank you all for coming.
M	WOMAN MOURNER	Thank you for doing this, Emily.
M	THE MOURNERS	Yes, thank you, Emily.
F	EMILY	As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly. I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel. And I don't want to kid myself about the stupid, meaningless way she died, because it would really make her throw up. But I don't want it to become the summation of her life. Because it's not. When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can you stand it?" And she said. "First of all I can't. But I don't want to take away the twelve years she did have, and turn them all into leukemia. Because they weren't." So despite the fact that she got -- ripped off, I do think it's important to remember that Monica got a lot out of life. She was the most fully developed person I personally have ever known. She was also impossible to get along with, but that's another story. Everybody laughs.
M	EMILY (CONT'D)	As most of you know, she had more than her share of trouble over the years. But that never diminished her compassion or stopped her from embracing life to the absolute fullest -- measure.
M	2ND MOURNER	She sure did.
F	EMILY	So. Now I've said my little piece. And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met. She was twenty one. Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence.
M	WOMAN MOURNER	It's OK, Emily.
F	EMILY	I know...! (She waits) And I was nineteen! Even though it's impossible for my children to believe I.was ever that young. Emily's college-age kids, a boy and a girl, smile warmly at
F	LISA	Emily, thank you so much for letting me be here.
F	EMILY	Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by.
F	LISA	Didn't she have any family?
F	EMILY	No, she was the last one. Except for some cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail. She's the one who gave you my number...
F	LISA	Yeah...
F	EMILY	Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all.
M	WOMAN MOURNER	Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so much for doing this. Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.
F	EMILY	Listen. I still can't believe this is happening...! (she starts crying) I mean what the fuck is wrong with her?
M	WOMAN MOURNER	I don't know!
F	EMILY	I don't understand why she didn't kill herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and then after all that with her mother, and then her father, she gets hit by a fucking bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica. Always the worst luck. Always. (noticing LISA) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming.
F	LISA	I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.
F	EMILY	It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're very sweet.
F	LISA	Goodbye.
M	WOMAN MOURNER	Goodbye. As Lisa-goes out she hears:
M	WOMAN MOURNER (CONT'D)	Who is that?
F	EMILY	That's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident. She was right-there when she died, and she wanted to come to the funeral. I told her there was no funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I wouldn't have done that at her age, would you?
M	WOMAN MOURNER	No...
F	LISA	No -- M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn? . Thank you. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." What do you make of that? Lisa? Lisa?
F	LISA	I don't know.
M	JOHN	Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here?
F	LISA	I don't know. Sorry.
M	JOHN	You know what, Lisa? That's not good enough. That's not good enough. Shakespeare wrote something: What's your response? And don't tell me you don't have one because I don't buy it.
F	LISA	I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me.
M	JOHN	Matthew?
M	MATTHEW	I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 74
M	MATTHEW (CONT'D)	Like as far as the gods are concerned we're just ants. Nothing. (like a newscaster turning to his colleague) Darren? The class laughs.
M	DARREN	Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's Gloucester. Maybe another character would have a different point of view.
M	JOHN	OK: That's a valid point. Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesn't mean he personally agrees with it. Yes: David?
M	DAVID	Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying there's a higher consciousness that we can't see. That the gods' perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception, our perceptions are like comparing flies to OK...I don't think that's what he's getting at...I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
M	DAVID	But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness, and he's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary, that's just because we're limited by our viewpoint.
M	JOHN	Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." I have to agree with Matthew, that seems pretty unambiguous.
M	DAVID	Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher purpose that we can't see. He's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isn't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is.
M	JOHN	OK, but -- I still don't think that's what he's trying to say. Um...
M	DAVID	No, like if you say they kill us for their sport, when our perception of the gods is so meager that we can't even tell what they're doing, then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport? I don't know ...Um -- Monica?
F	MONICA	I don't think that's what he's saying at all. I think he's saying the gods don't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun --
M	MATTHEW	Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys. Anybody? Anybody?
F	MONICA	Yeah...1
M	DAVID	But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do anything?
M	JOHN	David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here --
M	DAVID	Scholarly opinion...:
M	JOHN	And in this particular play what I think he's trying to say is pretty black -- pretty bleak --
M	DAVID	But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?
M	JOHN	No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on --
M	DAVID	I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped.
M	JOHN	No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like to move on. David laughs derisively.
F	LISA	Hi Dad.
M	KARL	Yeah! Hi! How's everything been going?
F	LISA	OK. How are you?
M	KARL	Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here listening to some music. Having a glass of delicious beer.
F	LISA	That sounds pleasant.
M	KARL	Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How's the boyfriend situation?
F	LISA	Well...there's this one guy I sort of had something going with. But he kind of has a girlfriend, so...
M	KARL	Uh huh? 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 76A
F	LISA	I realize I'm incredibly enthralling...
M	KARL	You are. You're a beautiful girl. And you've got brains. That makes you dangerous.
F	LISA	Don't forget mature.
M	KARL	Well -- I'm hoping you're not too mature.
F	LISA	No...Don't worry.
M	KARL	OK good. That was a good answer,.
F	LISA	Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship...
M	KARL	OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK?
F	LISA	Well, I think he already knows I like him.
M	KARL	Uh huh? OK...
F	LISA	.I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little --
M	KARL	That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is tough.
F	LISA	Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him.
M	KARL	Yeah. Lemme know what happens.
M	KARL	OK. Well, everything's OK here...A little
F	LISA	Actually, Dad? I definitely want to hear how things are with you in a minute, but I actually have something kind of serious I want to ask you about ...I'm kind of soliciting people I respect-for their views on this...
M	KARL	OK. What's up?
F	LISA	. so do you think I should go back to the police, or what?
M	KARL	OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be.
F	LISA	You mean to protect myself before I go back?
M	KARL	There's nothing wrong with knowing what you're getting into. I'm gonna call my friend Lorne, I want to see what he says. ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house.
M	ANNETTE LISA	Hey...! Actually, Dad? Please don't call anybody. KARL Seriously. I appreciate Hi babe. your taking charge and everything, but -- ANNETTE Hello? Did you get my message?
M	KARL	Um -- I got a message.
F	ANNETTE	About the flowers? For my mother?
M	KARL	I don't know. Yes. Hold on. (To LISA) I'm sorry, Annette just walked in.
F	LISA	That's OK.
F	ANNETTE	Who are you talking to?
M	KARL	I'm -- It's -- could I just --
F	LISA	Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far.
M	KARL	Uh huh?
M	ANNETTE LISA	Who is that? Not that I'm trying to make this woman's KARL horrible death into my own Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium... to quote George Bernard ANNETTE Shaw. Good. Will you please ask her
M	KARL	I'm sorry, Lisa. Hold on one second. Yes.
F	ANNETTE	Will you please ask her if there's anything we don't know about that she won't eat? For the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch, because they do all the meals ahead of time
M	KARL	Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of something.
F	ANNETTE	Karl, I was supposed to call them last week. You said you were gonna call her and you didn't. So then I called her, and she never called me back. So what do you want me to do?
M	KARL	OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now.
F	ANNETTE	-- and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu.
M	KARL	I'm going to ask her. I will. We're right in the middle of something.
F	ANNETTE	OK. Tell her I said hi.
F	LISA	Hello? Hi.
F	LISA	Mom? What's wrong?...Did you have a bad show? What time is it?. Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every BLOOD is streaming out the faucet and filling the basin. Hello? (Pause) Hello...? She hangs up.
M	MRS MARETTI	Hi, can help you?
F	LISA	Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Lisa Cohen. I was involved in the same accident that Mr Maretti was involved in a few weeks ago...
M	MRS MARETTI	Oh my God, were you? Oh my God, what a thing, huh?
F	LISA	Yeah...I was just wondering if I could talk to him fora minute. Is he home?
M	MRS MARETTI	Ummmmm, yeah, sure. Whyn't you come in.
F	LISA	Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you...We never met. My name is Lisa Cohen...
M	MARETTI	Yeah...What can I do for you?
F	LISA	Well...do you remember me? From the bus accident?
M	MARETTI	I don't know.. .What' s this about?
F	LISA	Well, would it be OK if I talked to you for a minute?
M	MARETTI	What do you want to talk about? I don't understand.
F	LISA	I'd just like to talk about the accident for a minute. I don't want anything, and I'm not here to do anything bad. I just wanted to talk to you about it.
M	MARETTI	How did you get my address?
F	LISA	It's in the phone book. I was gonna call first...
M	MARETTI	Well, it woulda been better if you woulda called. We're about to sit down... Mrs Maretti has drifted back toward them. I don't get what, uh...Yeah all right. Let's go outside.
F	LISA	I'm sorry: Could I use your bathroom?
M	MARETTI	No, let's just go outside.
M	MRS MARETTI	Oh Gerry, let her use the bathroom.
M	MARETTI	No, I don't want her to use the bathroom. I don't understand what this is.
M	MRS MARETTI	Will you kids settle down, please! I'm not kiddin'! Lisa goes in the bathroom.
M	MARETTI MRS MARETTI	What's the matter with you? Who is she?
M	MARETTI MRS MARETTI	She's some girl who was at the Nothin's the matter with me, bathroom.
M	MARETTI	Honey, just do me a favor, wait inside.
M	MRS MARETTI	No. I wanna hear what this is.
F	LISA	Well ...If it's OK, I'd rather talk to Mr Maretti in private.
M	MRS MARETTI	No it's not OK.
M	MARETTI	OK. We're just tryin' to...OK: What? Lisa looks at them, wishing Mrs Maretti would leave.
F	LISA	OK. I hope this isn't going to insult you too much...
M	MARETTI	Insult me...?
F	LISA	.I was just wondering if you felt bad at all about what happened.
M	MARETTI	Do I feel bad about the accident?
F	LISA	Yeah.
M	MRS MARETTI	You know, honey? Are you just upset about the accident...?
F	LISA	Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very blood! I've never been covered in blood before, and I wanted to talk to you about it for a minute! Why is that so strange!?
M	MRS MARETTI	Gerry... why don't we all go inside and sit Could I please talk to you alone?
M	MRS MARETTI.	OK, what is goin' on here?
M	MARETTI	Nothin's goin' on here. So whyn't you calm down? Look: Go ahead inside. Let me find out what this is. Meantime whyn't you make sure those kids aren't killin' each other, all right?
M	MRS MARETTI	All right. Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 84A As Mrs Maretti goes inside: No, you know what? Let 'em kill each other. Give us all a rest. (To LISA) All right, Lisa. What. Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 85
F	LISA	I just...Well, I just want you to know...
M	MARETTI	Yes? What? Speak!
F	LISA	Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident...
M	MARETTI	Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident.
F	LISA	Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose.
M	MARETTI	On purpose...?
F	LISA	But it wasn't like...
M	MARETTI	What. (Pause) Speak. Talk! What!
F	LISA	Well ...I mean ...We were looking at each other...
M	MARETTI	Who was looking at each other...? You and me?
F	LISA	Well ...Yeah ...I mean. . .not like... romantically or anything...
M	MARETTI	Romantically...!
F	LISA	OK, scratch that. 'Cause that's not even... relevant... You're not comin' through very clearly!
F	LISA	OK. I can see the way this is.
M	MARETTI	The way what is? What! Speak to me! What?
F	LISA	I am --
M	MARETTI	Don't drag me outta my house on a Saturday afternoon and then make me stand here pullin' teeth to find out what you're talkin' about. I've got my kids inside: You're an attractive young lady, you show up at the house -- Please! Get to the point or go home. Because I don't care enough, frankly, to stand around here tryin' to figure out what you're doin' here! (Pause) What! What! What! What!
F	LISA	All right! Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat --
M	MARETTI	Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. What.
F	LISA	If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it --
M	MARETTI	No Criminality, that's right.
F	LISA	-- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman.
M	MARETTI	OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over here.
F	LISA	Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened.
M	MARETTI	OK. First of all, I don't really know what you mean by wavin' at you...What were you, tryin' to catch the bus...?
F	LISA	No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your --
M	MARETTI	Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to say, you know, "Step away from the bus," if the bus was in motion, I would've waved you away for your-own safety, but that's all that would be. Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 87
F	LISA	You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again.
M	MARETTI	No. Not really. No.
F	LISA	Well ...I think we both remember something different.
M	MRS MARETTI	Your brother's on the phone.
M	MARETTI	Tell him I'll call him back. Mrs Maretti goes back inside.
F	LISA	I'm not trying to get you in trouble.
M	MARETTI	I know you're not, because you couldn't get me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no criminality found...the report is, uh, final. And that's it.
F	LISA	So you're just gonna leave it?
M	MARETTI	I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back.
F	LISA	I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened.
M	MARETTI	But you already talked to them!
F	LISA	I know that. But I lied.
M	MARETTI	You lied.
F	LISA	Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.--
M	MARETTI	Then how come nobody else saw it?
F	LISA	I can't help what other people saw --
M	MARETTI	You would think somebody else would see it.
F	LISA	I just know what I saw!
M	MARETTI	Then why didn't you say something right then?
F	LISA	Because -- when they were asking me what happened -- it seemed like you were kind of looking at me -- like we were saying to each other, "Let's not say anything about what happened."
M	MARETTI	Oh, now I really don't know what you're talkin' about.
F	LISA	I can't prove that you were doing that -- Mrs Maretti comes back outside.
M	MARETTI	What did I say anything to you? Did I threaten you?
F	LISA	No! And I am not blaming you for any of this! All I'm saying is that I didn't really tell the cops what happened, and I didn't want to go back without -- But you told 'em what you saw! You told 'em what you saw! And so did I! Only I'm the one behind the wheel!
M	MRS MARETTI	Gerry! Take it easy!
M	MARETTI	No, it's all right. Leave it alone. (To LISA) You wanna ruin my life, start tellin' 'em about looks, and you waved at me and I had on my cowboy hat, go ahead! You're gonna go back to school and do your homework and I'm gonna lose my job! And who's gonna feed my kids? You? Are you gonna do it? And for what! She's dead! She's dead! And there's nothin' I-can do to bring her back!
F	LISA	I just want to say what really happened.
M	MARETTI	Hey do whatever you fuckin' want.
M	MRS MARETTI	Gerry -- !
M	MARETTI	But those cops are gonna laugh in your fuckin' face because this was not my fault!
F	LISA	It was both our fault.
M	MARETTI	What'd you say?
F	LISA	It was both our fault. Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen.
M	MARETTI	Yeah. Don't say that to me.again without a lawyer. Gimme your phone number.
M	MARETTI	What's your number? Gimme LISA your number. Oh, you wanna Mjy? No! Why do you want it? come to my house like some anonymous person, I can't get in touch with you? MRS MARETTI What's your fuckin' number, Gerry! Take it easy! Lisa Cohen!
F	LISA	Fine! It's -- um -- 212- 555 --
M	MARETTI	
F	LISA	0157. Why do you need it?
M	MARETTI	Do whatever you're gonna do. I hope you got a good lawyer.
F	LISA	I don't know why you're -- Maretti turns and goes in the house.
M	MRS MARETTI	You know this was very traumatic for him! It's almost as bad as getting your deg cut
M	MRS MARETTI	Does your mother know you're here?
F	LISA	Yes.
F	EMILY	Why didn't you say anything before?
F	LISA	I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to do.â¢
F	EMILY	You didn't know what to do? The woman is killed right in front of you and you didn't know what to do?
F	LISA	I know it doesn't sound very impressive.
F	EMILY	Impressive! (Pause) All right: I know you're trying to do the right thing now. What does your mother say?
F	LISA	My mother hasn't really been that helpful.
F	EMILY	What do you mean?
F	LISA	I mean she's got a lot going on right now and she just hasn't been that interested, I guess.
F	EMILY	What could she possibly have going on?
F	LISA	Her show is opening.
F	EMILY	What do you mean, her show? What show?
F	LISA	She's in a play.
F	EMILY	My friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it, and your mother can't be bothered because she's in a play?
F	LISA	Well, it's kind of a big deal for her. She has a really big part.
F	EMILY	I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but, that is pretty shocking.
F	LISA	I guess she's really worried about getting a bad review or something.
F	EMILY	OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin - you talked to her -- And you're gonna go talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go with you?
F	LISA	No thanks.
F	EMILY	Do you think maybe you should ask your mother to go with you?
F	LISA	I think I can handle this part myself.
F	EMILY	Oh, I am so angry. I am so angry.
F	LISA	He didn't do it on purpose.
F	EMILY	Fuck him! I'm gonna run over his best friend and then coerce some teenage girl into lying to the police about it! He had his chance. Fuck him! Now are you gonna see this through or not?
F	LISA	I will if you will.
F	EMILY	OK! Thank you. OK? Emily impulsively and somewhat tearfully embraces Lisa, who Hey! Let me tell you something, Eliot -- She is interrupted by entrance APPLAUSE.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	You want to fire me, go ahead and fire me. Only don't tiptoe around me like.some-kind of deranged ballerina every time I see you in the fucking hall! Now: Do you have anything to say to me, Eliot?
M	VICTOR	Um -- you're not fired...? This gets a pretty big laugh from the audience.
F	JOAN	Oh. (Abashed, friendly) What are you guys talking about? Another big laugh. IN THE AUDIENCE -- LISA, CURTIS and RAMON sit together,
M	RAMON	She's good, eh?
F	LISA	Yes...
F	JOAN	Did you find it?
F	LISA	Just a minute!
F	JOAN	Can we just forget it? If they were any good somebody would have called me last night.
F	LISA	No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway?
F	JOAN	I don't. It's just a lousy feeling. Can't you understand that? If they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree with it, or base your self-esteem on it. Why can't you understand that?
F	LISA	I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty --
F	JOAN	Oh shut up.
F	LISA	So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK?
F	JOAN	Fine. Lisa finds The New York Times review online.
F	JOAN	Did you find it? Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 94
F	LISA	Yes.
F	JOAN	Is it bad?
F	LISA	Let me read it. (she reads) OK, it's really good.
F	JOAN	It is?
F	LISA	Oh my God. Listen to this:
F	JOAN	Don't read it to me.
F	LISA	".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into something approaching sheer luminosity..."
F	JOAN	Get out.
F	LISA	"But don't be misled by her feather-light touch and expert comic timing. With the canny (Has trouble enunciating:) bray...
F	JOAN	Bravura?
F	LISA	Yes. "-- of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft...? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical." Shut up!
F	LISA	OK. This is the best review I've ever read.
F	JOAN	Just for me, or for everyone? No, he likes the play, he likes the cast, but the main thrust of it is basically what a genius you are, and how your time has come. 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 95
F	JOAN	Fuck him, what does he know? (A la Noel Coward) Maddening and magical, eh? If only I knew what that meant.
F	LISA	Oh my God you're a huge star.
F	JOAN	Oh my God!
F	LISA	Can I make coffee now?
F	JOAN	Yes. Thank you honey. Lisa heads for the kitchen as the PHONE RINGS.
F	LISA	Here come the offers.
F	JOAN	Hello?... . I know, can you believe it?
M	RADIO NEWSCASTER JOAN (O.C.)	-- when the seventeen year- No, Lisa read it . No, her jacket -- speak to me that way: You know I'm Top of Craft. Lisa closes the door or turns up the radio.
M	JOHN	Spring and Fall to a young girl by Gerard Manley Hopkins. "Margaret are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving? Leaves, like the things of man, you With your fresh thoughts care for, can you? Ahl as the heart grows older It will come to such thoughts colder
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	By and by, nor spare a sigh Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie,
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	And yet you will weep, and know why. Now no matter, child, the name: Sorrow springs are the same. Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed What heart heard of, ghost guessed: It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for." Silence.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Any thoughts? Lisa? Lisa looks up slowly.
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	Could I help you?
F	LISA	Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here?
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	No he's not.
F	LISA	Oh. Um -- I talked to him on Monday and he said he'd be here after three...
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	Yeah, he's not back yet. Could I help you with something?
F	LISA	Um, well, do you know when do you expect him?
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	What's this about?
F	LISA	I was involved in an accident a few weeks
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	Uh huh?
F	LISA	And I filled out a report with Detective Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report, so I thought I should --
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	What do you mean amend the report? How do you want to amend it?
F	LISA	Well, there was something I didn't tell him, and I wanted to tell him, because --
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	So wait, I don't understand. You wanna change your statement?
F	LISA	Yes! Yes! I want to change my statement. (Pause. Calmer) Yes.
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	Well, you'd usually have to talk to the investigating detective on the case...
F	LISA	Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here now. Which he's not. So... You remember the case number?
F	LISA	No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on Broadway -- it was in a lot of the newspapers...
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	OK, yeah, sure OK. Sit down, sit down. Thank you. I ---
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	You know the case is closed.
F	LISA	I assume it was. But part of the reason it's closed is because of my statement. And the statement I gave --
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	Because of your statement? Another male detective walks by, behind LISA. The two men
F	LISA	Yes. What do you mean it was closed because of your statement?
F	LISA	I mean --
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	The DA's office closes the case. You don't close the case. The DA's office closes the
F	LISA	I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean I personally closed the case, like, legally. I meant that what I said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed, because I was the --
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	What's your name, honey?
F	LISA	Lisa Cohen.
F	LISA	Don't call me honey, OK? Pause.
F	LISA	Are you not gonna help me now that I said that?
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	Look -- what's your name?
F	LISA	Lisa Cohen!
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	OK Lisa, first thing, you're gonna calm
F	LISA	I'm calm right now!
M	2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE	OK. Just checking. Second thing -- Oh! Here he is: Your knight in shining armor.
M	MITCHELL	This guy been givin' you a hard time?
F	LISA	No...
M	MITCHELL	What's this guy been sayin' to you?
F	LISA	Nothing. I don't know if you remember me... I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on Monday?
M	MITCHELL	Sure I do. What's up?
M	MITCHELL	So now you're sayin' he ran the light.
F	LISA	Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road. And I was definitely trying to get his attention...
M	MITCHELL	No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin' with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs the light, hits the decedent, she dies on the scene...the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements, and then somewheres in there you turn around, decide the guy belongs in jail. That right? That about right?
F	LISA	I don't have any control over if he goes to jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I just want to set the record straight, so that if he gets away with this I won't have been a part of it.
M	MITCHELL	And what do you think I should do with you? Just gimmeâ¢a clue. 'cause I'm just a little bit lost over here...:
F	LISA	Do whatever you want. I know what I did.
M	MITCHELL	OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa, anybody will tell you that just because he ran a red light is not a criminal offence.
F	LISA	Even if he kills someone? Even if you cause an accidental death, that's right. For this to be a criminal offense, the law says you need two aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red light and he was --
F	LISA	So he's not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter? Or second degree murder?
M	MITCHELL	No. He could be charged with reckless driving, and fillip' out a false police report. Which, that's no joke --
F	LISA	That's unbelievable! What does he have to do? Kill her on purpose?
M	MITCHELL	Yes. Because that's the definition of murder. Killin' somebody on purpose. You're not sayin' he ran her over on purpose, are you? Pause.
F	LISA	No. Pause.
M	MITCHELL	All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,
F	LISA	You're kidding.
M	MITCHELL	No. I'll go over it with my sergeant, probably pull this guy in again. Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on him. See what he says. Thank you...! Thank you.
F	BONNIE	OK, so we're just gonna start with a_couple of simple stretches.
F	LISA	.Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint.
F	BECKY	We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John...! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher,
F	LISA	Hi John.
F	BECKY	Hi John. (Pause) Want some? They giggle.
M	JOHN	Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j. on your way to a school soccer game! Now come on!
F	LISA	Sorry.
F	BECKY	We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away. OK: How about how he's like, "Smokin' a j." Like, "You can't be smokin' a j." They all burst out laughing. CU on the angry embarrassed back of John's reddening grown-up
F	LISA	Hi, Mr Aaron...!
M	MR AARON	How are you, Lisa?
F	LISA	I'm pretty damn good. How are you?
M	MR AARON	I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me something. Whatever happened with that situation?
F	LISA	Oh...â¢I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime...(squinting at him in the sunshine) Hey, what kind of a bike is that?
M	MR AARON	Um, a Trek.
F	LISA	I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle?
M	MR AARON	As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no...
F	LISA	But you must have ridden a lot of horses.
M	MR AARON	What makes you say so?
F	LISA	Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that?
M	MR AARON	Someplace like what?
M	- LISA	You know: Not New York.
M	MR AARON	I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details.
F	LISA	God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews?
M	MR AARON	Is that a real question, or a Lisa question?
F	LISA	What's a Lisa question?
M	MR AARON	A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer...?
F	LISA	About half and half.
M	MR AARON	In that case --
F	LISA	Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second?
M	MR AARON	All right.
F	LISA	Thanks. Aaron gets off the bike. She climbs on. The seat is too high
M	MR AARON	You want me to adjust the seat?
F	LISA	No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward I like your bicycle...! Can I have it?
M	MR AARON	No! She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches
M	MR AARON (CONT'D)	OK. Off.
F	LISA	Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me.
M	MR AARON	Lisa...!
F	LISA	I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close.
M	MR AARON	I can't even be having this conversation with you.
F	LISA	Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here.
M	MR AARON	You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike.
F	LISA	It's not my fault if I revere you as a god! He laughs or smiles briefly in spite of himself.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy right now.
M	MR AARON	I'll see you in class. We pull away with him as she watches him go.
F	JOAN	Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if you wanted dinner.
F	LISA	Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something.
F	JOAN	Someone named Emily called. And Detective Mitchell called from the Accident Investigation Squad. Is that the one you talked to?
F	LISA	Yeah, did he say anything?
F	JOAN	Just to call him back. What's going on? Did you ever go back and see him?
F	LISA	I'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door. I'll tell you later, if that's OK.
F	JOAN	Of course it is. Who's Emily?
F	LISA	She's the friend of the woman who died, the one who had the funeral...
F	JOAN	Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the phone.
F	LISA	OK. How's Ramon?
F	JOAN	Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like him. He's really nice. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 106 But I'm not sure he actually ever understands a word I say.
F	LISA	Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the guy.
F	JOAN	But don't you know what I mean? I just feel kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?
F	LISA	You feel lonely when you're with him?
F	JOAN	Yeah. You never felt that way when you were with someone?
F	LISA	I guess so. I feel that way all the time. You get used to it.
F	JOAN	Well ...I don't know how serious I want to get with somebody who makes me feel that way.
F	LISA	So don't get serious. That's my advice. Pause.
F	JOAN	All right. I'm gonna go.
F	LISA	Have a good show.
F	JOAN	Thank you. (calling) Goodbye Curtis!
F	JOAN	'Bye sweetie.
M	NEIGHBOR	Hello...! Hello.
M	NEIGHBOR	Congratulations on the show...!
F	JOAN	Thank you.
M	NEIGHBOR	That was such a wonderful review...! And I read somewhere it might be going to Broadway?
F	JOAN	Supposedly. In March.
M	NEIGHBOR	God! Exciting...!
F	JOAN	Yeah, it's going well. Knock wood.
F	EMILY	Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends. He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't know what to do himself he'll certainly know someone we can talk to.
F	LISA	OK, great.
F	EMILY	So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told me, if you don't mind repeating
M	DAVE	Not at all. I love to repeat myself.
F	LISA	Are you guys gonna order something?
M	DAVE	When someone is killed it's what you call a Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory case, which just means there's a statute passed by the legislature which gives you the right to bring the case.
F	LISA	As opposed to what?
M	DAVE	As opposed to common law, which is law made by judges. Which is why the damages are limited.
F	LISA	I don't understand.
F	EMILY	Look, just skip that part. We don't care about that.
F	LISA	I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy...!
M	DAVE	No -- the police are not, uh --
M	LISA EMILY	Why not? They told me they Dave doesn't think the were gonna look into it police are gonna --
M	DAVE	I'm just telling you that even if they do, there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the DA that they charge this guy. That's why -- So what can we do?
M	DAVE	Well. I'm --
F	LISA	Sorry. Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109
M	DAVE EMILY	That's OK -- That's OK, honey...
M	DAVE	I'm just getting to that. You can't do anything unless you're a relative --
F	EMILY	She didn't have any relatives, except for those idiots in Arizona -- -- or -- hang on a minute -- unless you're executor of her estate --
F	EMILY	I am the executor of her estate.
M	DAVE	-- which is Emily. I know.
F	EMILY	So good.
M	DAVE	Yes. This is good. Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: --like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore...
F	LISA	You can really sue for that?
M	DAVE	Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,
F	LISA	So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver?
M	DAVE	Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company.
F	LISA	But do you think the driver would get fired? Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109A
M	DAVE	No. Not necessarily.
F	LISA	Even if all the facts came out at the trial?
M	DAVE	Maybe. I don't know.
F	EMILY	But how much could they be liable for?
M	DAVE EMILY	It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them?
M	DAVE	-- if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that.
F	LISA	I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.
M	DAVE	And I gather in a lot .of pain?
F	LISA	Her leg was cut off.
M	DAVE	Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time?
F	LISA	I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake.
F	EMILY	That's OK.
M	DAVE	Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict? A brain damaged baby would beâ¢ three million. But the truth is, Lisa, after all's said and done, it's not a very good case.
F	LISA	Why not?
M	DAVE	Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case.
F	EMILY	Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here.
M	DAVE	I understand that --
F	EMILY	We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy.
M	DAVE	I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer.
F	LISA	Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself.
M	DAVE	That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias.
F	EMILY	Impeached for what?
M	DAVE	She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win.
F	LISA	So that's'something, isn't it?
F	EMILY	But do you really think we know what that means?
M	DAVE	I'm sorry. That's what its called.
F	EMILY	But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating.
M	DAVE	I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm just thinking out loud.
F	EMILY	OX. All right. I'm sorry...I
M	EMILY (CONT'D)	He wasn't always a lawyer you know. He used to be a very nice little boy.
M	DAVE	Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity.
F	LISA	Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy --
F	EMILY	Is to fucking get this guyl No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus!
M	DAVE	Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages.
F	LISA	I think she had a pretty good idea.
M	DAVE	If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better...I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to...
F	EMILY	I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak:
M	DAVE	I actually did have one more thought...I do know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls, and then, just let me get back to you.
F	EMILY	I would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened.
F	LISA	Yes, Detective Mitchell please? . My name is Lisa Cohen? C 0 H -- Yes, I'll hold. (On hold) Fuck you...
M	MITCHELL	Detective Mitchell.
F	LISA	Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.
M	MITCHELL	Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?
F	LISA	Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus driver...
F	LISA	You did? What happened?
M	MITCHELL	Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this point.
F	LISA	But how did you ask the questions?
M	MITCHELL	Excuse me?
F	LISA	He's obviously not gonna change his politely: Why would he? We already know he's a liar.
M	MITCHELL	Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and we'd get whatever answer we want out of him. But fortunately we don't do that kind of thing anymore --
F	LISA	Yeah, not to white people.
M	MITCHELL	Excuse me?
F	LISA	You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you --
M	MITCHELL	We don't do it to who?
F	LISA	Oh my God...
M	MITCHELL	First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city --
F	LISA	Yes, thank you, yes.
M	MITCHELL	-- and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not gonna take this case. (Pause) Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to, but --
F	LISA	Yes, I would.
F	LISA	So there's no way to appeal --
M	SERGEANT V.O.	There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case.
F	LISA	But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there?
F	JOAN	What's going on? LISA waves her away.
F	JOAN	-- so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before.
M	RAMON	But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance.
F	JOAN	No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that experience.
M	RAMON	Mm hm? She takes a few steps away.
F	JOAN	I love this view...(Pause) You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common?
M	RAMON	What do you mean?
F	JOAN	Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam?
M	RAMON	I don't think we should talk about that, Joan.
F	JOAN	You don't? Well...I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up.
M	RAMON	Joan... I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends.
F	JOAN	My friends...!
M	RAMON	Yes. 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116 He sips his drink. Joan doesn't know what to say. Pause.
M	RAMON (CONT'D)	May I show you some pictures of my boys?
F	JOAN	Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like.
M	RAMON	That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena...My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva.
F	JOAN	Uh huh...
M	RAMON	I'm sure they will go back eventually, because they like to do something for their country. But it's a worry, because it's very bad there now.
F	JOAN	Yeah...I haven't really been following it.
M	RAMON	It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the solution.
F	JOAN	Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about it...Do you mind if I ask you something?
M	RAMON	Of course not.
F	JOAN	Why are you interested in me?
M	RAMON	You don't think I should be?
F	JOAN	I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world...
M	RAMON	You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things?
F	JOAN	Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual?
M	RAMON	Not for me.
F	JOAN	I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life.
M	RAMON	You should travel more.
F	JOAN	I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater...
M	RAMON	Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of it.
F	JOAN	I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband --
M	RAMON	Karl.
F	JOAN	Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it.
M	RAMON	I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting?
F	JOAN	I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age.
M	RAMON	She would prefer the world with no plays? No films?
F	JOAN	Oh... Who knows.
M	RAMON	Would you like to see a picture of my mother?
F	JOAN	Sure.
M	RAMON	These are all my aunts and uncles...See? Big family...
F	JOAN	Mmm. She looks at him as he turns the pages.
M	DAVE	So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I. I know and I asked him to --
F	EMILY	You called a what? A what?
M	DAVE	Private Investigator -- to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver --
F	LISA	Really?
M	DAVE EMILY	Yeah: So he -- Dave!
M	DAVE	Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms...
F	EMILY	Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
M	DAVE EMILY	And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we give a fuck about the MTA police and their uniforms?!
M	DAVE	-- so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents -- less than two years apart -- one of them on the job, one in his own car --
F	EMILY	What?
M	DAVE	-- where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts --
F	EMILY	Are you fucking kidding me?
F	LISA	Why does this not shock me?
M	DAVE	Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union --
F	EMILY	O-Kay...l
M	DAVE	And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault.
F	LISA	This is making me sick.
M	DAVE	I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case.
F	LISA	We do?
M	DAVE	What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called "Negligent Retention." Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody.
F	EMILY	And you can prove that?
M	DAVE	Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway.
F	EMILY	And that means...
M	DAVE	That means we're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin' asses off.
F	EMILY	But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?
M	DAVE	No no. Oh no.
F	LISA	Why not?
M	DAVE EMILY	I'm not a personal injury It's not his area. litigator. I don't know enough about it. I would lose.
F	EMILY	But you could recommend someone?
M	DAVE	Sure. I know a guy who's very good. His name is Russel Deutsch. He's not a sleazebag. Very experienced. Let me give you his number...
F	EMILY	Dave, thank you so much.
F	LISA	Really. My God.
M	DAVE	But you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because she's gonna be your beneficiary.
F	EMILY	She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now.
M	DAVE	If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna come to New York.
F	LISA	What's with Monica and her cousin?
F	EMILY	Oh, Monica's father left some money to Abigail's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate, because he didn't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 121
M	EMILY (CONT'D)	For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering her about it on the phone for fifteen years: Always trying to borrow money against the estate, accusing her of making lousy investments with it, nasty phone calls, nasty letters, every month for fifteen years until Abigail's daughter turned twenty-one and got married. Then Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak to her. She's a dream.
F	LISA	So that's who we're getting the money for?
F	EMILY	It's not who we're getting it for, it's who we're getting it from.
M	DEUTSCH	First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA. They get .twenty days to respond, and when they do we can make our Discovery requests: Accident reports, personnel records, et cetera. But you gotta realize it's gonna take some time. The law says you have to get a court date within a year. Usually it takes about six. Depending.
F	LISA	Six years!
M	DEUTSCH	Depending, yes.
F	EMILY	Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Times...
M	DEUTSCH	Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as
F	EMILY	So they'd.make it a condition that
M	DEUTSCH	It's usually done, you get the money but you can't talk about it. Nobody knows the terms.
F	LISA	So what good does that do?
M	DEUTSCH	You get the money. (Pause) is that bad? (Pause) I thought that's what we're all here for. (Pause) This is how our society punishes people for doing bad things.
F	LISA	By getting money from their employers' insurance. companies?
M	DEUTSCH	Yes. It's called Punitive Damages. Pause.
F	LISA	Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement?
M	DEUTSCH	Yes, sure, why not?
F	LISA	But is that something people do?
M	DEUTSCH	Sure. It's one of your conditions.
F	EMILY	Great.
F	LISA	And you think we're gonna win? They're gonna settle?
M	DEUTSCH	Oh they're gonna settle.
F	LISA	This is -- Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze.
F	JOAN	I want to talk to you.
F	LISA	What'd I do now?
F	JOAN	Hi. I'm Joan. It's nice to meet you.
F	EMILY	Nice to meet you too. Come on in. Hi Emily.
F	JOAN	.I had a friend who used to live on this block, at 262...?
F	EMILY	Oh...?
F	JOAN	Yeah, I don't know if you know her. Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?
F	EMILY	No, I don't know her.
F	LISA	I think about a thousand people must...
F	JOAN	What?
F	LISA	Nothing...
F	EMILY	Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
F	JOAN	Oh -- Yeah...
F	LISA	You should go see it, it's really good.
F	JOAN	Well, the play is great, and it's a really nice cast..-.
F	LISA	She's just being modest. She's gonna win every award in New York.
F	JOAN	Oh -- all that stuff's a long way off.
F	EMILY	I don't go to the theater very much.
F	JOAN	Well, it's just nice, because you can work a long time in the theater and play really good parts without getting a lot of recognition. And even though you don't necessarily do it for that as your primary motive, it is very nice when people do notice something you've done.
F	EMILY	Uh huh...
F	JOAN	I was on a television show a few years ago, and I had been doing theater all my life, and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate me because they thought I finally Made It. And it was really just this dumb show that paid the bills for a while...
F	LISA	That show was so stupid.
F	JOAN	It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because you've frankly become such a big part of Lisa's life, and I don't want to be intrusive, but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and I can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it
F	LISA	That's not true...!
F	JOAN	Well, I can't...! And I want you to know, Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for pursuing this the way you have. But I can't let you pursue it to the point where it's taking over your life or interfering with your school work. (To EMILY) It's really come down to a question of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship at her school. And I know she feels a real sense of responsibility about what happened Yeah, I do.
F	JOAN	I know you do. I know you do. But you can't not do your homework, and you can't throw away your scholarship because of it.
F	LISA	I'm not. My grades slipped a little. They'll get better. Anyone can do their homework. You just sit down and do it. I've been distracted. I'll stop.
F	JOAN	All right --
F	LISA	We didn't need to have a big conference about it. It's not a big conference, I just want to know what's going on. And I wanted to meet Emily... (to EMILY) I know it's a little awkward!
F	EMILY	Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been keeping you apprised of what's been going on, I think she should. You should.
F	LISA	There's nothing to keep her apprised of., We're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference.
F	JOAN	Now what is that?
F	LISA	Mom? It really doesn't matter.
F	EMILY	A Discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order. authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records, interviewing witnesses, talking to Monica's cousin...
F	JOAN	OK, now where does she fit in?
F	EMILY	She gets the money.
M	DEUTSCH	How would you describe the relationship overall? Did you talk on the phone a lot? Were there a lot of visits --
F	ABIGAIL	I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that...I would call her, she would call me...
M	DEUTSCH	And what were the nature of these conversations?
M	ABIGAIL.	Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my kids...
M	DEUTSCH	And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing?
F	ABIGAIL	Oh, I would say so, yes.
M	DEUTSCH	Would you have any phone records? Or --
F	ABIGAIL	I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual conversations...
M	DEUTSCH	No no -- You'll see we talked on the phone quite frequently.
M	DEUTSCH	OK, that's terrific. I see you came prepared...1
F	ABIGAIL	Well, I wanted to bring everything.
M	DEUTSCH	Now when they take your deposition you're gonna say the same thing you just told me. Talk about the relationship...
F	ABIGAIL	Uh huh?
M	DEUTSCH	Kind of advice she used to give you...
F	ABIGAIL	Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?
F	EMILY	He was recommended by a friend.
F	ABIGAIL	I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of --
F	EMILY	My friend's heard of him. He says he's very good..
F	ABIGAIL	I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky...
F	EMILY	He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you.
F	ABIGAIL	No, if you all think he's good...
F	EMILY	I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is.
F	ABIGAIL	All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle?
F	LISA	I just wanted to...I was just there.
F	LISA	Oh my God, is that you? That's me. And that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my
F	LISA	God... So how old was she when she died?
F	LISA	God. I can't even imagine.
F	EMILY	Neither could we.
F	LISA	You know Monica asked about her when she was dying? 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128A-129 Emily looks up.
F	EMILY	No. I didn't. minute. And then she was asking me to call her, like to tell her what happened: You know, like she didn't remember she was dead.
F	EMILY	What do you mean? What did she say?
F	LISA	She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No, that's my name." Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond. But I couldn't tell if what I was saying Emily does not respond.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	But then when I found out her daughter was dead, ever since then I keep having this really strong feeling that some way, for those last five minutes I kind of was her daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the reason I was there: Like in some weird way, this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes, right before she died. I see. And is she still inhabiting your body? Or did she go right back to the spirit world after it was over?
F	LISA	I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all. I don't give a fuck what you believe in.
F	LISA	Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!?
F	EMILY	Because this is not an opera!
F	EMILY	Yes!
F	LISA	You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!?
F	EMILY	I think you're very young.
F	LISA	What does that have to do with anything? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who's older! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before!
F	EMILY	No, it means you care more easily! There's a big difference! Except that it's not you it's happening to!
F	LISA	Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who was run over --
F	EMILY	That's right, you weren't. And you're not the one who died of leukemia, and you're not the one who just died in an earthquake in -- Algeria! But you will be. Do you understand me? You will be. And it's not an opera and it's not dramatic --
F	LISA	I'm well aware of that!
F	EMILY	And this first-blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing.
F	LISA	Oh wow.
F	EMILY	Do you understand? It's not worth anything, because it'll be troweled over in a month or two. And then when you get older, and you don't have a big reaction every time a d gets run over, then, then we'll find out what kind of a person you are! But this is nothing! I'm sorry, but I didn't start this conversation and I don't play these games. 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 131
F	LISA	I am not --
F	EMILY	And don't look so outraged! Because I'm not telling you to knock it off! You have every right to falsify your own life, but you have no right to falsify anyone else's. It's what makes people into Nazis! And I'm sorry, but it's a little suspicious that you're making such a fuss about this when you didn't know her, and you're having troubles with your own mother --
F	LISA	Oh my God!
F	EMILY	But this is nm life we're talking about, much more than it is yours! Because it's my real friend who got killed, who I'm never going to see again, really! Whom I have known since I was nineteen years old myself. OK? And I don't want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self- dramatization!
F	LISA	I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
F	EMILY	
F	LISA	I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking strident?
F	EMILY	Strident?
F	LISA	Yeah.
F	EMILY	OK. Um, you should leave.
F	LISA	Why? Because I called you strident?
F	EMILY	Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks. I don't wanna be called strident and you're deliberately misunderstanding me!
F	LISA	No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as it is: You don't have to call me stupid too!
F	EMILY	Well I can't stop you doing this so I think you had better go.
F	LISA	OK! I will.
F	LISA	OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Does this mean we're dropping the whole inquiry?
F	EMILY	It means you're leaving. I don't know what else it means.
F	LISA	All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic! I obviously misused the word!
F	EMILY	Look it up when you get home.
F	LISA	Jesus Christ. You're amazing.
F	EMILY	Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.
F	LISA	Why are you doing this... .!
F	EMILY	Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human being! Monica was a human being! So was her daughter! And so is your mother!
M	EMILY (CONT' D)	We are not supporting characters in the fascinating story of your life!
F	LISA	I never said or thought you were...! And I really didn't mean to call you strident! I to insult you, Emily, I really wasn't! I feel so bad about what happened and I'm trying so hard to do something about it! And I don't understand why if I say something wrong you can't just give me a break! I didn't mean I thought her daughter took over my body. I'm not an idiot. It was just this feeling I had because she was holding onto my hand so hard before she died, and because we had the same first name!
F	LISA	But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that.
F	LISA	I will. They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly.
F	JOAN	I've been in the theater my whole life and nothing like this has ever happened to me...
M	INTERVIEWER ON TV(O.C.)	Now, any talk of the play becoming a film?
M	JOAN ON TV (O.C.)	Oh, I'm sure. But I would never get cast in that. I'm not a movie star.
M	INTERVIEWER ON TV (O.C.)	But you're a theater star... I don't know about that either...
M	INTERVIEWER ON TV (O.C.)	You are! I guess...!
F	JOAN	Oh God. Joan buries her face in her hands. Lisa watches scowling.
F	JOAN	Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to come see the play? I thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out afterwards.
F	LISA	All right. Let me ask her.
F	JOAN	Dig in everybody... They start eating.
F	LISA	I was thinking about spending next year with Dad. Oh?
F	LISA	Yeah. You're all worried about my grades. They have really good public schools in Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship.
F	JOAN	Have you talked to him about this?
F	LISA	We've had some general discussions. Do you want to go too? Me?
F	JOAN	Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too?
M	CURTIS	No.
F	JOAN	Well, just let me know if you do.
F	LISA	Why are you being like this?
F	JOAN	Why am I being like what?
F	LISA	Why are you about to start crying?
F	JOAN	Because it's your intention to make me start crying!
F	LISA	No it's not --
M	- JOAN	You want to move to LA. Move to LA.
F	LISA	But why can't this even be mentioned without you taking it personally? I'm just introducing a possibility! Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She
F	JOAN	Here's a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner! Here's a possibility LISA that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ! want to do, because I don't What is with you? even care anymore, you heartless little fuckin' bitch!
F	LISA	Fine! Keep it up! It really makes me want to stay here!
F	JOAN	You think you're so fucking perfect!? She breaks something else and walks out.
F	LISA	No.
M	CURTIS	Good one.
F	LISA	Shut up. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 136
M	KLEIN	OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.
M	KIRSTEN	I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes.
M	KLEIN	All right: Lisa?
F	LISA	I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.--
M	LEWIS	Such as what?
F	LISA	Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth?
M	KLEIN	OK... Hitler Youth.
F	LISA	Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties? Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 137
M	LISA (CONT'D)	And maybe running the risk of having your youthful enthusiasm be co-opted by adults for purposes of their own that you might not even ultimately agree with? Angie's hand shoots up. So do several others.
M	LEWIS	OK, Angie?
F	ANGIE	Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either, because I realize I'm completely outnumbered --
M	ANTHONY	Not unlike the Palestinians themselves.
F	ANGIE	That's not really funny, Anthony. ANGIE (to LISA) KLEIN -- and I'm not even going to Segal: Cut the comedy. just compared a 19-year-old ANTHONY Palestinian to a member of I thought it was funny... the Hitler Youth, which I personally find so offensive LISA I don't even know where to â¢That's right! Because humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last KLEIN fifty years? Hey! Hey! Lisa! Hey!
M	LEWIS LISA	Come on, guys... Yes! That's partly why they like it! There's ANGIE still a million Pale- If anyone's acting like stinians who don't blow Nazis it's the Israeli up children on busses government! because they're so "frustrated!"
M	LEWIS	OK, OK! Monica?
F	MONICA	Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers -- just for example -- care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it. 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138
F	ANGIE	Yes. Yes!
F	LISA	I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement!
F	ANGIE	Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country?
M	LEWIS LISA	Raise your hands! They haven't tried any other ways! It's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it!
M	ANGIE (CONT'D)	Oh they like it? They're just bad people and they like it?
F	LISA	Yes! There are bad people in the world! I think they liked blowing up the World Trade Center! They kill their own sisters when they get raped! It's called barbarism!
M	MONICA LISA	Who kills their own sisters? It's practically all people LIONEL If they didn't like it they You guys are not the only wouldn't do it! Period! ones in this class!
M	KLEIN & LEWIS	Hey! Silence.
M	LEWIS	If you ladies can't make your points without yelling or interrupting each other or raising your hands, I'd say it was a pretty good argument for "No."
F	LISA	Why, adults don't yell and interrupt each other? 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138A
M	LEWIS	Lisa!
F	LISA	Sorry.
M	LEWIS	Let's try to put this in a broader perspective. The question was not actually who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict
F	ANGIE	The Israelis.
F	LISA	OK, you're a moron.
M	LEWIS	Lisa!
M	ANGIE KLEIN	You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who LISA raising their hand is. I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class! who cares what I am? I'm anti- murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS Lisa? Lisa? You can leave!
F	LISA	Fine. Thank you. Lisa passes the blackboard, grabs some chalk and checks "NO. "
M	LISA (CONT'D)	By the way, she just proved my point.
M	ANGIE LEWIS	No I didn't. Lisa, GO! Lisa leaves. Lewis turns to the class. An O.C. burst of APPLAUSE takes us to --
M	RAMON	That's the best show yet! Every time it's a better performance.
F	JOAN	God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much for coming...
F	EMILY	Oh, thank you for the tickets. Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.
F	JOAN	Shall we go?
F	LISA	-- and I guess I lost my cool a little, but I just love it'when people start comparing the Israelis to Nazis...
F	JOAN	But who is running these discussions...?
M	RAMON	Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo.
F	JOAN	Mmm.
M	- EMILY	How do you mean, Ramon?
M	RAMON	I mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because it's his law and his order. He uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law. But when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status he's called a criminal and a terrorist, and the violence of the State is called upon to put him down, and once again it's called the rule of law. In
F	EMILY	I see. And what would you like them to do? Pause.
M	RAMON	"They" meaning --
F	EMILY	The Jew oppressors. What would you like them to do? Pause.
M	RAMON	I didn't use that expression. EMILY But since you ask - No, you didn't. (i.e.
F	LISA	Um, I just spent the whole day arguing about this: I didn't really mean to bring it up again.
F	EMILY	Don't handle me.
F	LISA	I'm not handling you. What did you think of the play?
M	RAMON LISA	And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom. of Nazis find it essential EMILY -- find it essential to If the Israelis were like sustain their occupation. any Arabs left, and I'm
F	LISA	That's what I think! Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.
F	JOAN	That seems excessive, Emily, come on --
M	RAMON	That's the response. That's the Jewish response.
F	EMILY	It's the what?
M	RAMON	It's the Jewish response. You don't like what I am saying or what I do, so you --
F	EMILY	That's my Jewish response. Emily throws her drink in his face and walks away.
F	JOAN	Oh my God...! That's all right... It's a perfect little .encapsule...It's the Jewish response. A horrible silence as they watch Ramon clean his shirt.
F	LISA	Sorry about all that tonight.
F	JOAN	Yeah. Your friend is a delight.
F	LISA	She's a really passionate person. She really cares about things.
F	JOAN	She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --
F	LISA	So what? Why is it so JOAN important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in an exchange of ideas. As it happens Ramon said a few things I wasn't too crazy about either, so I guess that's the end of that...
F	LISA	Oh is that supposed to be Emily's fault too?
F	JOAN	I don't want to talk to you right now. Please go away.
M	RAMON	Joan, I won't defend myself. All what I you will get from someone who will take that position that that woman was taking. But if you like to break up with me because I used the wrong adjective, what I'm going to do? I'm not going to beg you.
F	LISA	Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?-
F	JOAN	Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.
F	LISA	Hello? Yeah. It's Dad.
F	LISA	Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip...
M	KARL	Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen.
F	LISA	Really? What's the matter?
M	KARL	Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel.
F	LISA	I never said I didn't want to go.
M	KARL	Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so --
F	LISA	I think-he's really looking forward to it --
M	KARL	Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh...I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year.
M	KARL (CONT'D)	It looks like things are gonna start picking up for me in the Fall, which means I'm probably not gonna be around the house all that much, and since you and Annette detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't think that's what I want to come home to after a fourteen hour day.
F	LISA	We don't detest each other
M	KARL	OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being?
M	KARL	OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, whenever.
M	KARL	Yeah. He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
F	JOAN	What's wrong?
F	LISA	Dad's cancelling the trip.
F	JOAN	What? Why?
F	LISA	He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money.
F	JOAN	Did you say you didn't want to go?
F	LISA	No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip.
F	JOAN	Oh boy.
F	LISA	I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.
F	LISA	Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.
M	MR AARON	That's all right...
F	LISA	You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it.
M	MR AARON	It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going on?
F	LISA	I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I know.
M	MR AARON	Well...I doubt that's actually true but thank you...
F	LISA	You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings...So when you're rational - just to finish my thought -- it's like this really interesting way of governing yourself. And you don't have to get all uncomfortable again: I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about, because I know that subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about your soul, I guess, and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying at all?
M	MR AARON	Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them...Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised...
F	LISA	Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than not.
M	MR AARON	That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they -- (Pause) I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with...
F	LISA	No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Just a little hot...A little warm .Is this all right?
M	MR AARON	Sure.
F	LISA	Do you allow smoking in your apartment?
M	MR AARON	You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and
F	LISA	I like your apartment.
M	MR AARON	Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away.
F	LISA	Sorry.
M	MR AARON	That's all right.
F	LISA	This is terrible.
M	MR AARON	What is? What's terrible?
F	LISA	I just like you so much...(Smooths her ash on the ashtray.) Sorry. What a moron.
M	MR AARON	Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change.
F	LISA	Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times.
M	MR AARON	Lisa...
F	LISA	Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on.
M	MR AARON	
F	LISA	Don't stop me yet, OK? They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.
M	MR AARON	Please don't do that.
F	LISA	Just let me for one second... She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.
M	MR AARON	Are you all right?
F	LISA	Nothing. It's OK.
M	- MR AARON	Maybe we should stop.
F	LISA	Don't stop. It's OK.
M	MR AARON	Are you all right?
F	LISA	Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me that.
M	MR AARON	I think we should stop.
F	LISA	No, keep going...! She keeps pushing against him.
F	LISA	All I can say is I better get a pretty fuckin' good grade in geometry this year. (Pause) Lighten up! I'm kidding.
M	MR AARON	Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like this to happen. I'm really not sure how to react.
F	LISA	Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Anyway, it's just sex. You're acting like a little kid. I'll see you in school. She walks out. He is very flummoxed. had two previous driving violations on his
M	DEUTSCH	Well, they want to settle. They do...?
M	DEUTSCH	I have a meeting with their lawyer this afternoon, and they want to discuss a settlement. So we should get Abigail on the phone and talk about what-we're gonna do.
F	EMILY	Fantastic. Lisa gets tears in her eyes and smiles, embarrassed.
F	LISA	Sorry.
F	EMILY	That's OK.
F	ABIGAIL	Mr Deutsch? Mr --
M	DEUTSCH ROB	I'm right here. I just had the thought -- Mr Deutsch -- I'm just gonna give my husband the floor because he had a few
M	ROB	Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're better off waiting a little bit, maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more...
F	ABIGAIL	Yes, if they're so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis --
M	DEUTSCH	What you gotta realize -- What you gotta
F	EMILY	Abigail, Russel doesn't think -- Sorry, go My friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is --
M	DEUTSCH	.Could I interject?
F	ABIGAIL	But if they responded so strongly based on one story...
M	ROB	Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.
M	DEUTSCH	They are responding to the story in the paper...
F	ABIGAIL	.That's just common sense.
M	DEUTSCH	But what you gotta understand is they're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper.
M	EMILY LISA	That's why Russel thinks -- Besides, the main point is
F	ABIGAIL	I'm sorry --
M	ROB	-- We didn't hear that last.
M	DEUTSCH	Ladies, let me just -- Abigail. Rob.
M	DEUTSCH (CONT'D)	If I could finish my thought -- They're jumpin' at the bait right now, but if another six months goes by we run a serious risk of losing our momentum. You see what I mean? Now I'm gonna hit 'em very very hard, I guarantee you. That's why I wanted all of us together on the phone, so we could talk about your other terms, besides the
F	ABIGAIL	What other terms would there be?
M	ROB	What do you mean, like some kind of a fund?
M	DEUTSCH	A what? Some kind of fund? For the kids?
M	DEUTSCH	I don't understand what you mean by a fund...
M	ROB ABIGAIL	What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund?
F	LISA	These people are retarded.
F	ABIGAIL	Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children, and it was not a pleasant experience. We just want a clean, straight damages is fine. A regular payment. We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll have something in our hand... I don't really know what kind of fund you're talking about...
F	LISA	We're not talking about -- Hi, this is Lisa? We're ABIGAIL talking -- We're talking Hello, Lisa. about -- Hello? Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 152 Pause.
F	ABIGAIL	We're still here.
F	LISA	We're talking about the driver, getting the driver fired --
F	ABIGAIL	Oh, yes --
F	LISA	-- as part of the conditions.
F	EMILY	Yes, Abigail, it's very important to us that the company know that's an absolute pre-condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever.
F	ABIGAIL	Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at
M	ROB	Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean?
M	DEUTSCH	Absolutely.
M	ROB	What we're most concerned about here is the amount.
F	EMILY	Yes, we're getting that, Rob.
M	ROB	But you see what I mean?
M	DEUTSCH	Yes -- Rob? Yes I do.
M	ROB	I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature.
F	ABIGAIL	Absolutely. We're not lawyers --
M	DEUTSCH	Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something clear. One conversation does not commit you to anything.
M	DEUTSCH (CONT'D)	And I'm not gonna agree to anything without consulting you. But I'm working for you.
M	DEUTSCH (CONT'D)	So if you're telling me not to take the meeting I'm not gonna take the meeting.
M	ABIGAIL - ROB	No. We're not saying that. No no no -- Go for it.
F	JOAN	Lisa, I'm really proud of you!
F	LISA	Thank you.
F	JOAN	Really, really proud...!
F	LISA	Thank you. Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Are you upset about something...?
F	JOAN	No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think?
F	LISA	Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him.
F	JOAN	you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting it.
F	LISA	No shit. You're on your own, Mom.
F	JOAN	Thanks a lot.
F	LISA	You're welcome. The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up. Hello? -Yes . WHAT DO YOU MEAN??
F	LISA	What's the matter? Yes? . Yes? (To LISA) Ramon had a heart attack.
F	LISA	What? Is he gonna be --
F	JOAN	uiet! CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead
F	LISA	OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?
F	JOAN	I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little
M	RODRIGO	Excuse me. Joan?
F	JOAN	Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry. She impulsively embraces him. Rodrigo, this is my --
M	RODRIGO	I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked about you all the time.
F	JOAN	He did?
M	RODRIGO	Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died.
F	JOAN	Really?
M	RODRIGO	I don't know if this is appropriate...
F	JOAN	No it's OK...!
M	RODRIGO	.but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with.
F	JOAN	Well -- he was a very sweet man. And I know he loved you and your brother very much. Yeah, I know he did. Thank you.
F	JOAN	Thanks for coming with me today. I really appreciate it.
F	LISA	Oh, you're welcome.
F	JOAN	I don't want to be macabre, but Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear The Tales of Hoffman the week after next and I still have the tickets. Would you be interested in going? Or should I give them away?
F	LISA	Um, I'll go.
F	JOAN	OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.
F	JOAN	What did you make of that? People don't relate to each other, Mom. They're totally disconnected. And if they have any time for each other at all, it's either like a biological imperative or like some weird cultural anomaly. That's what I make of it.
F	JOAN	Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that you think that. Because I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well.
F	LISA	I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. It's just a general observation.
F	JOAN	OK...Hey, could I get a hug?
F	LISA	Sure. Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.
F	JOAN	I just feel totally at sea. They break apart.
M	MR AARON	I've thought about this a great deal, and I'm going to come forward.
F	LISA	Oh brother.
M	MR AARON	What does that mean?
F	LISA	"You're gonna come forward." And do what? You didn't kill anybody.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	You just had sex with me after I practically begged you to. You're a guy. "I'm gonna come forward."
M	MR AARON	Well, that's what I'm comfortable doing.
F	LISA	Suit yourself. I'll deny everything and you're gonna look like a total psycho. then spend the rest of her life feeling bad about it. So why don't we just skip the whole thing and forget about it?
M	MR AARON	I'm not sure I know how to do that.
F	LISA	You'll learn.
F	LISA	Good news!
F	JOAN	OK. What do you want to do?
F	LISA	What do you mean? Aren't JOAN you going to tell me. It's your body. It's your what to do? (half- baby. What do you want to do? laughing) Baby... .?
F	JOAN	Yes! Now who is the father?
F	LISA	It could be a lot of people. Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan
F	JOAN	Who.
F	LISA	I'm never gonna tell you, Mom! It's against my principles! Such as they are. No, but you want to send that bus driver to jail for running a red light! And you won't tell me about these boys?
M	NURSE	Mrs. Cohen? TRACKING Joan as she gets up and follows the Nurse down a .she's still a little woozy from the anaesthetic... Joan goes into the recovery room. Lisa is on the table in a
F	LISA	Hi.
F	JOAN	Hi honey.
F	LISA	I'm sorry, Mom.
F	JOAN	Let's talk about it later.
M	DEUTSCH	I'm very pleased to be able to inform you all that I had a long meeting with the lawyer for the bus company, and they've agreed to settle out of court for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
M	ABIGAIL & ROB	What! Fantastic! That's wonderful!
M	DEUTSCH	I'm assuming this is agreeable to
M	ABIGAIL ROB	Yes, fantastic That is fantastic! But I gotta -- obviously I gotta bring the offer to you, get your approval -- Mr Deutsch...?
M	DEUTSCH	little bit --
M	ROB	That's OK --
F	ABIGAIL	We're only --
F	EMILY	Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to it once he's told us the whole story and given us his recommendation...
M	ROB	Yes. Sorry. Fire away.
M	DEUTSCH	I was gonna say I know there was a concern the gun a little bit --
M	ROB	That's OK --
F	ABIGAIL	We were just --
F	EMILY	Would you let him talk please?!
M	DEUTSCH	It's OK.
F	ABIGAIL	We're sorry.
M	DEUTSCH	I want to tell you I think it's a very good offer.
M	DEUTSCH (CONT'D)	I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher --
F	ABIGAIL	Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars...
M	ROB	OK, now let me just --
M	ROB ABIGAIL	I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can the thought -- you all hear me?
M	DEUTSCH, EMILY, LISA	Yes!
F	ABIGAIL	Yeow! Was that everybody? OK:
F	LISA	What about --
F	ABIGAIL	-- Emily? What do you think?
F	EMILY	I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the -- Hey, if that's the vote...
M	ROB	Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more.
M	DEUTSCH	I think it would be a big mistake.
F	ABIGAIL	Robbie, what do you think?
M	ROB	Sold!
F	ABIGAIL	Sold!
M	DEUTSCH	OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that the removal of the driver.
M	LISA & EMILY	What?
F	LISA	What do you mean?
M	ROB	The driver?
M	LISA EMILY	Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal of the driver?
M	DEUTSCH	Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello!
F	ABIGAIL	It's just a blast in our ears. Let him finish.
F	LISA	Finish what? Forget it! Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa, I pressed them very very hard on this, but they will not discuss disciplining of a company employee as part of the settlement because it could be seen as an admission of guilt on the part of the MTA --
F	LISA	What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean? Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right
F	LISA	Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.'
M	DEUTSCH	I know that's your reaction...
F	LISA	It's the only reason we're here.
M	ROB	Can I jump in here? Russel? .but it's really not your decision.
M	ROB ABIGAIL	Hello? Are you still with us? Please!
F	LISA	It's Emily's decision.
F	EMILY	No.
M	DEUTSCH	No.
M	ROB	Hello?
F	LISA	It's not?
F	ABIGAIL	They're not listening, Robbie.
M	DEUTSCH	It's Abigail's decision because she's the next of kin.
F	LISA	But she didn't even know about it!
F	EMILY	That doesn't matter.
F	ABIGAIL	Could we get back in this conversation please?
M	DEUTSCH	Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this --
F	ABIGAIL	Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel's recommendation while we can. Because if they won't fire the guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six months or a year from now we're gonna --
M	ROB	Exactly.
F	ABIGAIL	we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean?
F	LISA	The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody else -- !
M	DEUTSCH	Lemme just clarify --
F	LISA	-- it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you were entitled to, for somebody you didn't even like... !
F	ABIGAIL	This is a distortion --
F	LISA	And the only reason you're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry for swearing, but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street --
F	EMILY	For getting him, Abigail!
F	ABIGAIL	Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously. You are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we don't do something about it right now.
M	ABIGAIL (CONT'D)	And rather than being abused over the telephone and cursed at for having the courtesy to involve you in these discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm wrong about that.
F	LISA	None of that matters --
F	ABIGAIL	Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is your interest in this?
F	LISA	Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm the one who killed her! But at least I know I did it, and that guy has no idea! And he's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong! And if they don't fire him and all you want is the money and the police won't do anything, how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you could get any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter about the money! You wouldn't have gotten it before!
F	ABIGAIL	Well it may not matter to you, but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative. Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was --
F	LISA	Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the
M	DEUTSCH & EMILY	Lisa!
F	LISA	You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a moralistic cunt! She runs out.
F	BONNIE	Hey, Lisa. What's Up?
M	- LISA	Hey, did you guys know I had an abortion last week? Pause.
M	MR AARON	No. I didn't know that.
F	LISA	Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars.
F	BONNIE	Um, should I...
M	MR AARON	No, no, don't go anywhere.
F	LISA	Yeah, don't go anywhere. Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks
M	MR AARON	Do you want to tell us about it?
F	LISA	Yeah. I do.
M	MR AARON	OK. -Go ahead.
F	LISA	Well... She doesn't speak. Pause.
F	BONNIE	Do your parents know about this, Lisa?
F	LISA	Yes.
F	BONNIE	Have you told the father, honey?
F	LISA	No...There's a couple of people it could be.
M	MR AARON	I think you better tell them. Whoever they are.
F	LISA	No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
M	MR AARON	I don't see what difference that makes, if he's sorry. And I think whoever it is should know about this.
F	LISA	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up. Please don't tell anyone.
F	BONNIE	We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're gonna have to tell whoever it could be --
F	LISA	That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about the father, because the whole thing was my fault. I'm sorry...! She shakes her head and runs away.
F	BONNIE	What was that...?
