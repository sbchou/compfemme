M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	Of course, it's not like the postcards say it is. This is what it's like. I'm Pete Appleton, and this is my town.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	Born and raised here, thank you very much. Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else. But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload. To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. To me, it's the theater that's playing "The African Queen."
M	DOORMAN	Newsreel's just starting, folks.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	That's me and my girlfriend. Her name is Sandra Sinclair, and this is her town, too -- she's from Cleveland. She came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing. The first picture I ever wrote, a little potboiler called "Sand Pirates of the Sahara." Okay, it ain't "Citizen Kane," but you gotta start somewhere.
M	NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER	Bringing the news of the world to you!
M	NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER	Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood.
M	NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER	Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self- incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them. Well, come after them they did! And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper!
M	NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER	And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress! This should give you fellas something to write about now! A new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood!
F	SANDRA	Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
M	PETE	You bet, honey.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	We were young, we were in love, and we were working in pictures. Life... was good.
M	PETE	Mornin', Ray. Whaddya know whaddya say? Me and Sandra caught "The African Queen" at the Chinese last night. Great picture, great picture.
M	RAY	Mr. Appleton.
M	PETE	What's with this "Mr. Appleton" crap? Your boss hiding in there?
M	RAY	You're clear to go in.
M	PETE	What's that mean?
M	RAY	Have a pleasant day.
M	PETE	Louise... what gives?
F	LOUISE	Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave everybody the day off... while they sort things out.
M	PETE	Sort what out? Are my pages done?
F	LOUISE	They took 'em.
M	PETE	They took 'em? Who took 'em? Louise, what's going on...
F	LOUISE	Pete, I'm not even supposed to be talking to you...
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Good morning, Peter.
M	PETE	Leo... what's going on?
M	LEO	Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
M	PETE	I... I don't believe this.
M	LEO	Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
M	PETE	Who the hell is this "they?"
M	LEO	Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. Now, did you go to any meetings?
M	PETE	No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
M	LEO	So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
M	PETE	Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non-political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
M	LEO	You should watch what you say.
M	PETE	I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
M	LEO	Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
M	PETE	What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
M	LEO	They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.
M	PETE	Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!
M	LEO	Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
M	PETE	I was decorated.
M	LEO	I know. A Purple Heart.
M	PETE	Exactly.
M	LEO	You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.
M	PETE	At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
M	LEO	You can't testify.
M	PETE	Why not?
M	LEO	Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible. What can I say? I like you.
M	LEO	They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
M	PETE	Yeah, well, that's enough.
M	LEO	Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um...
M	PETE	"Ashes To Ashes?"
M	LEO	That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
M	PETE	So, it is a blacklist.
M	LEO	Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
M	PETE	Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
M	LEO	Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point.
M	"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"	By Peter Appleton A United Pictures Production February 19, 1951
M	"ASHES TO ASHES"	By Peter Appleton
M	PETE	Huh. Red...
M	SANDRA (O.S.)	Pete? Pete...?
F	SANDRA	Oh, Pete...
F	SANDRA	What happened?
M	PETE	What exactly did you hear?
F	SANDRA	That you got let go.
M	PETE	I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
F	SANDRA	He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
M	PETE	Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
F	SANDRA	You mean, he was... let go, too?
M	PETE	They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
M	PETE	A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be! Right?
F	SANDRA	Of course, but I... I don't know how I... how much help I can be to you. This is the sort of thing... someone saying you're a communist... it can ruin your career.
M	PETE	Will you help me, Sandy?
F	SANDRA	I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...
M	PETE	So nice to be a pariah.
M	JERRY	Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?
M	PETE	Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
M	PETE	Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
M	JERRY	What.
M	PETE	You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
M	JERRY	The G-man?
M	PETE	Zackly.
M	JERRY	Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
M	PETE	Too bad. He says I'm a communist.
M	JERRY	You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
M	PETE	You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
M	JERRY	Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
M	PETE	This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
M	JERRY	Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
M	PETE	Sandra Sinclair.
M	JERRY	Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
M	PETE	Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
M	JERRY	I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her.
M	PETE	Nope. Can't. We're through.
M	JERRY	Then I'll call you a cab.
M	PETE	I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.
M	PETE	'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
M	JERRY	Pete...
M	PETE	Drive. Drive. Bad idea. Too drunk to drive.
M	PETE	One-thirty. Huh! Early. Can't go home yet.
M	PETE	Oops.
M	PETE	Huh? Whatsa...
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	I had no idea how I got to Santa Monica, but it certainly was a good idea. I don't think I could've faced the headache I had alone in my apartment. At least I had the ocean air.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	Three forty-five. I had only been there for a couple of hours at most. Truth be told, I was still fairly drunk.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	I'd head north until the sun came up or I ran out of gas, whichever came first.
M	PETE	Shit. Guess which came first.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	I should've known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour, but it wasn't like I had a lot of choices.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	What the hell. At least there'd be a diner opening in a couple of hours. I'd get some pie and coffee, and then I could worry about the gas. NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL
M	PETE	Oh my god! I don't believe... oh my god...
M	OLD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Maggie, whatcha got there? Huh, girl? Whatcha find?
M	OLD MAN	Mister, who are ya? My dog likes you, but that don't mean much, she likes skunks, too. Sweet n'stupid, that's why I keep her.
M	OLD MAN	Mister, you okay? You look wet. You in an accident or somethin'?
M	PETE	I... I don't know.
M	OLD MAN	You best come with me. Can ya walk?
M	PETE	I... yes, I think so.
M	OLD MAN	Come on, we'll have the Doc look you over.
M	PETE	My head hurts.
M	OLD MAN	I shouldn't be surprises. You smell like that was quite a night before you had there. Maggie! Let's go now!
M	WELCOME TO	
M	OLD MAN (STANTON)	Name's Stanton Lawson. My ancestors founded this town.
M	PETE	Ancestors?
F	STANTON	Actually, my grandpap. But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it? Here.
M	PETE	I suppose. Thanks.
F	STANTON	You look familiar, fella. What's your name?
M	PETE	I'm... I... I honestly don't know.
M	PETE	They all know you?
F	STANTON	'Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it?
F	STANTON	Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
M	PETE	The war...
F	STANTON	Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe.
F	STANTON	All told, this little town gave sixty- two of its finest to the war. Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. More'n its share, I should say. Got us a letter from President Truman. City council commissioned a war memorial. Been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years. Town never had the heart to put it up. Place just hasn't been the same since the war.
F	STANTON	You hungry, son?
M	PETE	Yes. Very.
F	STANTON	Got any money?
F	STANTON	Six bits. More'n enough to buy some breakfast. C'mon.
M	PETE	Pie's... good.
F	MABEL	Like you could tell. Where'd you find him?
F	STANTON	Down by the wash.
F	MABEL	We gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed. Three people have died there, Mister. You're lucky to be alive.
M	PETE	Thanks. More coffee?
F	MABEL	You know, you look familiar. You ever been in here before?
F	STANTON	He don't remember who he is, Mabel. Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon as he gets in.
F	MABEL	Doc should be in for his coffee and bear claw any minute... You sure you never been in here?
M	PETE	I'd remember this pie.
F	MABEL	I'll just get you another piece.
M	LARDNER	'Mornin' Harry. Fine day, isn't it?
M	HARRY	Morning, Doc. Yes, yes it looks just fine.
M	LARDNER	Plenty to do today?
M	HARRY	Oh, yes, plenty. Plenty.
M	LARDNER	After you.
M	LARDNER	Mornin' Mabel, Stan.
F	MABEL	Mornin' Doc. Got some new business for you today.
M	LARDNER	Hello, son. How'd that happen?
F	STANTON	He don't know. And he don't know his name, neither. Found him down by the wash.
M	LARDNER	You'd better come with me, son. On my tab?
F	MABEL	You bet.
M	PETE	Thanks. Great pie.
F	MABEL	You're welcome. Come again.
M	HARRY	Sweet Jesus...
M	LARDNER'S VOICE	Follow my finger. Just use your eyes. That's it. Good.
F	STANTON	He was passed out cold. Maggie woke 'im.
M	LARDNER	Uh-huh. He looks familiar. Open your mouth. Say "ah."
F	STANTON	Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off.
M	PETE	Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
F	STANTON	Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
M	LARDNER	Any idea how you got here, son?
M	PETE	No, sir.
M	LARDNER	Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
M	PETE	I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
M	LARDNER	Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
M	PETE	I guess I did.
M	LARDNER	Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
M	LARDNER	Here, one of mine.
M	PETE	Thanks.
M	LARDNER	Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before.
M	PETE	It's possible. I just don't remember.
M	LARDNER	And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
M	PETE	I... no, I... I just can't...
M	LARDNER	It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.
M	LARDNER	What is it?
M	PETE	Call me... Ishmael?
M	LARDNER	Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
M	LARDNER	Stanton found him by the wash. Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is. We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him. You bet. He'll be here.
M	LARDNER	That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
M	PETE	She's very pretty.
M	LARDNER	Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
M	LARDNER	...sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
M	PETE	Wish I could say the same thing.
M	HARRY	Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...
M	ELDRIDGE	Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
M	HARRY	Listen to me! The young man in there...
M	ELDRIDGE	Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just...
M	HARRY	Cecil, listen to me!
M	HARRY	It's Luke.
M	ELDRIDGE	No wallet, huh?
M	LARDNER	No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
M	ELDRIDGE	What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right?
M	PETE	Yes.
M	ELDRIDGE	You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
M	PETE	No. But...
M	ELDRIDGE	But what?
M	PETE	Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
M	ELDRIDGE	What's that?
M	PETE	"It's a Wonderful Life."
M	ELDRIDGE	The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh?
M	PETE	"It's a Wonderful Life?"
M	ELDRIDGE	Or the Bijou. Either one.
M	PETE	I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
M	ELDRIDGE	Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
M	LARDNER	By all means.
M	ELDRIDGE	Harry, why don't you come on in here.
M	LARDNER	Are you saying that he's...
M	ELDRIDGE	Shhhhhh.
M	HARRY	I knew all along. I knew you were alive! Oh, Luke...
M	LARDNER	Mother o'god...
M	ELDRIDGE	Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father!
M	PETE	My father...?
M	ELDRIDGE	C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
M	PETE	The Bijou?
M	LARDNER	That's where you live.
M	PETE	We live in a theater?
M	HARRY	Only one in town. Get in, son.
M	ELDRIDGE	Ben, when's Delly due back?
M	LARDNER	Tomorrow afternoon... ...oh my god...
M	ELDRIDGE	Exactly. Break it to her gently.
M	LARDNER	Get plenty of rest, Luke. You took a pretty big wallop there.
M	LARDNER	Good to have you back.
M	LUKE	Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
M	HARRY	Harry, son. Harry.
M	LUKE	And... what's my name again?
M	HARRY	Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
M	LUKE	Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it.
M	LUKE	How long have I been gone?
M	LUKE	How long?
M	HARRY	You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
M	LUKE	When did I leave?
M	HARRY	You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
M	HARRY	Nine and-a-half years ago.
M	LUKE	Nine and-a-half years...
M	ELDRIDGE	Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.
M	ELDRIDGE	Here we are.
M	HARRY	Well, son, you're home!
M	HARRY	Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
M	ELDRIDGE	Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke.
M	LUKE	Thanks.
M	HARRY	Wait'll you see the inside!
M	LUKE	Can't wait.
M	HARRY	We've been closed for a while.
M	LUKE	Ah.
M	LUKE	Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
M	HARRY	Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
M	LUKE	Why?
M	HARRY	Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
M	LUKE	Didn't you have any help?
M	HARRY	Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
M	HARRY	The day you shipped out. That was a proud day for your mother and me. Last time you saw her. Last time I saw you.
M	HARRY	Till today.
M	HARRY	That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
M	LUKE	Mother. She's beautiful.
M	HARRY	Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.
M	HARRY	Can I get you anything? I can put some coffee on or some...
M	HARRY	When I woke up this morning, my son was dead. Now, I have my boy again. I have my boy again.
M	HARRY	'Morning, Son.
M	ELDERLY WOMAN	Good morning, Luke.
M	ELDERLY BLACK MAN	'Mornin'.
M	HARRY	Sleep well?
M	HARRY	They couldn't wait to see you.
M	LUKE	Who... are they?
M	HARRY	This is the staff of the Bijou.
M	LUKE	Oh. What... what time is it?
M	HARRY	Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
M	HARRY	Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but you don't... you need to be re- introduced. Luke, this is Mrs. Irene Terwilliger.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Head cashier and refreshments clerk. So glad to have you back, my boy! Much more handsome than I remember him.
M	HARRY	And this fine fellow is our head usher, resident fix-it man and custodian. Luke, meet Old Tim. You remember Luke, don't you?
M	LUKE	Is there a young Tim?
M	OLD TIM	No.
M	LUKE	Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
M	OLD TIM	I'm old.
M	HARRY	Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on...
M	HARRY	'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway.
M	OLD TIM	I n-need me a new uniform.
M	HARRY	I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.
M	LUKE	You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
M	LUKE	I thought so.
M	HARRY	Anyone want to see the projector?
M	HARRY	Beautiful. Bright and even from edge to edge. See for yourself.
M	HARRY	She's always been a bit tricky.
M	OLD TIM	Bless.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Thank you, Timothy.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	What do you suppose they're talking about?
M	OLD TIM	Dunno. Boy's smart.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Yes, he seems to be.
M	OLD TIM	Bad for us.
M	LUKE	Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
M	HARRY	No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
M	LUKE	Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
M	LUKE	"February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
M	HARRY	Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
M	LUKE	"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
M	HARRY	Yes?
M	LUKE	"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
M	HARRY	Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
M	LUKE	Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
M	HARRY	I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
M	HARRY	...you were in a palace. It was like a dream. It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like. And spotless, too.
M	HARRY	Come with me!
M	HARRY	Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore. In here, you were safe. Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but... oh, god... it was beautiful.
M	HARRY	Charlie Chaplin. Keaton and Lloyd. Swanson. And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey... and Fred and Ginger.
M	HARRY	They... were... like... gods!
M	HARRY	And that... was the altar. Would you remember if I told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them? This television thing. Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen? Because it's convenient? Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat? Because you can just... sit there? How can you call that "entertainment," all alone in your living room? Where are the other people? Where's the audience?
M	HARRY	Where's the magic?
M	HARRY	I'll tell you. In a place like this, the magic is all around you. All the time. Everywhere. In every thing.
M	HARRY	The trick... is to see it.
M	LUKE	But I...
M	HARRY	Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.
F	ADELE	Dad?
M	LARDNER	Delly? In here.
M	LARDNER	How'd it go?
F	ADELE	Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
M	LARDNER	That's my girl! Did you...?
F	ADELE	No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? "Your Honor, I Object!"
M	LARDNER	I always told you, baby... ...it's all up here.
F	ADELE	Dad? What is it?
M	LARDNER	Well, it's...
F	ADELE	Oh my god... who died?
M	LARDNER	Drink slowly.
M	LARDNER	From the other side of the glass.
F	ADELE	I think it's worse now.
M	LARDNER	That always used to work.
F	ADELE	Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
M	LARDNER	Well...
F	ADELE	Dad...
M	LARDNER	He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
F	ADELE	...including me. Right?
M	LARDNER	I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst.
F	ADELE	You mean, me?
M	LARDNER	It's possible.
M	HARRY	I take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday. Have for years, since Lily died. If it weren't for Mabel, I'd probably starve to death.
M	ERNIE	Harry! Hold on a second!
M	HARRY	It's really him, Ernie.
M	ERNIE	Well, I'll be...
M	ERNIE	By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again.
M	LUKE	Uh, thanks. Good to see you again, too, uh...
M	HARRY	Ernie.
M	LUKE	...Ernie.
M	ERNIE	Well, I'll be...
M	HARRY	We were just gonna get some supper. Would you like to join us?
M	ERNIE	Would I ever!
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Is that Luke Trumbo?
M	KATIE	Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you back!
M	HARRY	Katie, would you like to join us for dinner? The more, the merrier.
F	CARL	Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head?
M	LUKE	Uh, no. What happened?
F	CARL	Well... um, all the hair got singed offa my head. It was pretty funny.
M	LUKE	Oh.
F	CARL	Even my eyebrows. But they grew back.
M	HARRY	Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball."
M	LUKE	Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry.
F	CARL	Oh, heck, that's all right. It's just good to have you back. Isn't that right, Bob? Hey, Luke, you remember my brother Bob? You two joined up the same day.
M	LUKE	Hey, Bob. Good to meet you.
M	ERNIE	Luke, I know there's a question that's on everybody's mind.
M	LUKE	What's that?
M	ERNIE	Well, now that you're back, what're your plans?
M	HARRY	Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what.
F	STANTON	That true?
M	LUKE	Well... we're gonna try.
M	ERNIE	That's a lot of work, son. Place's been closed, what, three, four years now. Gonna be tough.
M	HARRY	If it's tough, that means it's worth doing.
M	ERNIE	Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?
M	SPENCER'S VOICE	Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.
M	ERNIE	Well, come on out here so's we can see you.
M	SPENCER	Hey, Luke.
M	LUKE	Hi, Spencer.
M	ERNIE	Spence, that band of yours -- you think they're ready to play? Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol' big band.
M	SPENCER	We've been practicing... uh, sure, I guess.
M	ERNIE	Well, how about tomorrow night, eight p.m., in city hall square? What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome Home Luke" celebration.
F	ADELE	Do you... remember me?
M	LUKE	I've seen you before. Your picture...
F	MABEL	Look!
M	LUKE	...but I don't think I remember you.
M	LUKE	But I'll sure try.
M	LUKE	What.
F	ADELE	No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
M	LUKE	Me too.
F	ADELE	You look... different.
M	LUKE	I do?
F	ADELE	Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
M	LUKE	I did? Huh!
F	ADELE	You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
M	LUKE	Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
M	LUKE	I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
M	HARRY	You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
M	LUKE	You bet.
M	HARRY	Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
M	LUKE	There. We're alone.
F	ADELE	Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
M	LUKE	Well... where can we go?
F	ADELE	I know a place. Come on! City hall?
F	ADELE	You must not remember anything. Come on.
F	ADELE	You first.
M	LUKE	Why me?
F	ADELE	Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.
M	ADELE (O.S.)	When we were kids, my Dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time.
F	ADELE	Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
M	LUKE	How'd they get it inside?
F	ADELE	Through the door. It comes apart.
F	ADELE	Your name's on here. See?
F	ADELE	Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo."
M	LUKE	It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
F	ADELE	After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.
M	LUKE	So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
F	ADELE	And why not?
M	LUKE	Whoa.
F	ADELE	Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
M	LUKE	Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
F	ADELE	You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
M	LUKE	What did... what did I want to be?
F	ADELE	Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
M	LUKE	I just wish I could remember some of this.
M	LUKE	You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
F	ADELE	Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
M	LUKE	I'm sorry.
F	ADELE	No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
M	LUKE	No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
F	ADELE	Yeah...
M	LUKE	We were in love... weren't we?
F	ADELE	Yes. Hic!
M	LUKE	What was that?
F	ADELE	Nothing.
M	LUKE	Do you have the...
F	ADELE	I'm fine. Really.
M	LUKE	Were we going to get married?
F	ADELE	Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...
F	ADELE	...but you had to go... serve your country...
F	ADELE	Hey... it worked.
M	LUKE	Hey, fella. So you live here, too, huh? How come Harry didn't mention that?
M	LUKE	Um, Old Tim? Sorry, it's late. It's Luke. Can I come in?
M	OLD TIM	Found me.
M	LUKE	Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.
M	OLD TIM	Not used to visitors. Sit.
M	LUKE	So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
M	OLD TIM	Cat.
M	LUKE	Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
M	OLD TIM	We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
M	LUKE	Of course.
M	OLD TIM	Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform?
M	LUKE	I'll do everything I can.
M	OLD TIM	T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war.
M	LUKE	Yeah... me too.
M	MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton? You in there? This is the Super, I have the master key and I'm coming in!
M	LEO	You smell gas?
M	SUPER	Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
M	LEO	Jesus.
M	SUPER	Hey, it's the best way to tell.
M	SUPER	You think he's drunk somewhere?
M	LEO	Wouldn't blame him if he was.
M	SUPER	Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'?
M	LEO	What's his rent?
M	SUPER	Thirty a month.
M	LEO	Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
M	SUPER	Huh?
M	LEO	Take a hike. Am-scray.
M	SUPER	Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave.
M	LEO	Police department. I want to report a missing person.
M	CLYDE	You say you know nothing about it. You say this, yet you offer no proof. How am I supposed to believe you?
M	SECRETARY	Mr. Clyde? Agents Saunders and Brett need to see you.
M	CLYDE	You do see that I'm busy, do you not?
M	SECRETARY	It's about Appleton.
M	CLYDE	Tell them to come in. I'll have to call you back. I love you too, Mother.
M	SAUNDERS	We've got a situation developing...
M	CLYDE	Will you take those goddamn hats off?
M	SAUNDERS	We've got a situation developing out on the coast. Appleton's just been reported missing.
M	CLYDE	This is good. This is very good.
M	BRETT	Los Angeles Police Department investigated. His car's missing. No signs of forced entry or struggle at his apartment.
M	CLYDE	You two are on this as of now. Tell the LAPD their investigation has been federalized on my order. You find me this Appleton. I want to see what this one has to say.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	"The object of my affection, Can change my complexion, From white to rosy red..."
M	LUKE	Well...
M	HARRY	Yes?
M	LUKE	Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Oh, my.
M	HARRY	Nine hundred...
M	LUKE	And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?
M	HARRY	They're...
M	OLD TIM	That's my r-r-rent.
M	LUKE	Oh.
M	HARRY	It's all my fault. I was neglectful and this is the price of that.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Don't say that.
M	HARRY	Well, it's true. Wanting to open this place back up. It's folly, Irene, pure and simple. Might as well just call it what it is. Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
M	LARDNER	Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
M	LARDNER	Oh, hell...
M	LARDNER	Evening, Luke.
M	LUKE	Evening, Doctor Lardner.
M	LUKE	What's wrong?
M	LARDNER	Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
M	LUKE	Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big.
F	ADELE	Oh...
M	LUKE	I shouldn't have worn the suit.
F	ADELE	No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
M	LUKE	Oh...
F	ADELE	...and it's just... well, deja vu.
M	LARDNER	That's it. Deja vu.
M	LARDNER	You kids off to the dance?
M	LUKE	Aren't you coming?
M	LARDNER	No, I'm not much of a dancer.
F	ADELE	Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
M	LARDNER	I had it, a minute ago...
M	LARDNER	...ooooh, It's back. Well, you kids have fun now...
M	LARDNER	Aw, crap.
F	ADELE	This is strange. Do you feel it?
M	LUKE	What?
F	ADELE	We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
M	LUKE	Oh.
F	ADELE	You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
M	LUKE	It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
F	ADELE	Nine hundred...
M	LUKE	Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
F	ADELE	What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
M	LUKE	A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
F	ADELE	Well, there's got to be a way...
M	LUKE	Have you got a cigarette?
F	ADELE	When did you start smoking?
M	LUKE	I don't smoke?
F	ADELE	You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
M	LUKE	Oh.
M	LUKE	They're not bad.
F	ADELE	No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
M	LUKE	My what?
F	ADELE	Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
M	LUKE	Huh. That was nice of me.
F	ADELE	You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
M	LUKE	...he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
F	ADELE	Exactly. And he got good.
M	LUKE	No kidding.
F	ADELE	Now, did you remember that, or...
M	LUKE	Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
F	ADELE	Oh. Okay.
M	ALEX	You're the luckiest guy in town, Luke. Delly's 'bout the prettiest thing ever come outta Lawson.
M	LUKE	Thanks, Charlie.
M	ALEX	I'm Alex. He's Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	I'm Charlie.
M	ALEX	Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing we ever seen, ain't that right, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	You bet.
F	ADELE	Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.
M	CHARLIE	Hey, she's doin' that movie star, what's her name...?
M	ALEX	Hey, Delly, what was that test you was outta town takin'?
F	ADELE	It's called the State Bar Exam.
M	CHARLIE	Shoot!
M	ALEX	Imagine that, Charlie! A lady bartender!
M	LUKE	How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
F	ADELE	Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
M	LUKE	That's... pretty frightening.
F	ADELE	Your dancing's very good.
M	LUKE	Thanks.
F	ADELE	It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
M	LUKE	Guess I must've learned.
M	SPENCER	Thanks, folks. Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before?
M	SPENCER	Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke. I mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but I'm talking about this.
M	SPENCER	When you didn't come back, I learned how to play this so I could remember you. And now that you're back, well, I'll never forget you. Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us.
M	SPENCER	Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!
M	ERNIE	Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?
M	ERNIE	Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause I think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him.
M	ERNIE	You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country. A lot. And we never complained and we never faltered. And we never forgot.
M	ERNIE	We never forgot. And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle. Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again. I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive. But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too. God bless you, son.
M	ERNIE	All right, enough a'that. This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause I see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and I expect y'all to be there! All right, take it away, Spencer!
M	LUKE	Why don't you two get out there and dance?
M	HARRY	Oh, no, I...
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
M	LUKE	When was that?
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Nineteen-oh-nine.
M	HARRY	Son, we're gonna go. You two kids have a lovely time.
M	ALEX	Delly, can I have a dance?
F	ADELE	Sure.
M	FITTS	Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
M	LUKE	Good to meet you. Again.
M	FITTS	Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
M	LUKE	Thanks.
M	FITTS	And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
M	LUKE	We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
M	FITTS	I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought.
M	LUKE	Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
M	FITTS	Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. I just want the land.
M	LUKE	That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
M	FITTS	The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
M	LUKE	A super market. Huh.
M	FITTS	You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
M	FITTS	Good to have you back, Luke.
M	SPENCER	Last dance, folks!
M	HARRY	Beautiful, wasn't it?
M	LUKE	Yes.
M	HARRY	Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty- five, to be exact...
M	LUKE	Dad, I...
M	HARRY	Ha!
M	LUKE	...what?
M	HARRY	You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
M	LUKE'S VOICE	Harry. Dad, wake up. Wake up.
M	HARRY	Luke... what time is it?
M	LUKE	Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
F	VERA	Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention.
M	ERNIE	Thanks, Vera.
M	ERNIE	Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff. Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings. G'moring, folks.
M	LUKE & THE TRIO	Good morning.
M	ERNIE	I'm just guessing, but I bet it's not a sudden interest in Lawson politics that brings you all here.
M	LUKE	Well, no... I wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome, and making me feel at home. But I... we're... actually here on business of a sort...
M	DALEY	Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this comes under the heading "New Business," and this is not the time...
M	ERNIE	I think we can make an exception here, Daley.
M	DALEY	It'll need to be moved and seconded.
M	ERNIE	All right, motion to hear the speaker out of order.
M	WYATT	Seconded.
M	ERNIE	Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."
M	ALL	Aye.
M	ERNIE	Opposed? Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried.
M	ERNIE	Go ahead, son.
M	LUKE	Thanks. Well, I'll make this short and sweet. The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all. So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out.
M	WYATT	What kinds of things are you talking about?
M	LUKE	Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease.
M	FITTS	So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
M	LUKE	Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
M	LUKE	...but I think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start.
M	WYATT	Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can...
M	DALEY	...short of the allocation of city funds...
M	WYATT	...short of allocation of city funds.
M	DALEY	Seconded!
M	ERNIE	Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."
M	ALL	AYE!
M	ERNIE	Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried! Congratulations, Luke, you got yourself a town to help you out!
M	ERNIE	You know, this really ought to be out where people can see it.
M	LUKE	That was beautiful.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	I taught you that.
M	LUKE	I can play the piano?
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Oh dear, yes. You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense. You loved Chopin. You used to call it "heaven music." "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Sit. Play with me.
M	LUKE	No, I...
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Some of it might come back to you.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	That's good... that's good...
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Really, Luke! That's no way to treat Mr. Chopin!
M	OLD TIM	I taught him that. JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH Hollywood Writer Feared Dead Were Red Agents Involved? AN AMERICAN IN PARIS ADELE LOUISE LARDNER has PASSED the State Bar examination.
M	GREGORY (ONSCREEN)	You don't think you can win this, do you?
M	LUKE	"Ha! I'd say I was winning!" Ha! I'd say I was winning!
M	LUKE	"Gregory! Look out!"
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)	Gregory! Look out!
M	GREGORY	It's all right, Rebecca.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Is he dead?
M	GREGORY	Yes, Rebecca. He's dead.
M	LUKE	Sandra...?
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Luke? Dear, are you all right?
M	LUKE	My god... my god... no...
M	HARRY	Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...
M	HARRY	You're a good girl. No matter what I say.
M	HARRY	Oh, Jesus...
M	OLD TIM	Mr. Luke!
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	Luke! Luke, something's wrong!
M	LUKE	What?
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
M	LUKE	Come on, folks, this happens every once in a while, just settle down...
M	LUKE	Harry! Harry, why don't you cut the projector and bring up the house lights?
M	LUKE	Harry? Harry...?
M	LUKE	Jesus...
M	HARRY	The film broke...
M	LUKE	I know, I know... keep still.
M	LUKE	Get Doc Lardner.
M	LARDNER	It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
M	LUKE	Can we get him to the hospital?
M	LARDNER	Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry.
M	HARRY	Did you... did you...
M	LUKE	I'm here.
M	HARRY	Did you... did you...
M	LUKE	Did I what?
M	HARRY	Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.
M	LUKE	I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
M	HARRY	Anybody take it?
M	LUKE	A few.
M	HARRY	Vultures...
M	HARRY	I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?
M	LUKE	You're not going anywhere, Harry.
M	HARRY	Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son.
M	LUKE	And I love you... Dad.
M	HARRY	Oh, so... much... lighter...
M	COLEMAN	We commit to the earth the mortal remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo, safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved Lillian in the bosom of the Lord. Let us pray.
M	COLEMAN	"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures..."
M	ADELE'S VOICE (O.S.)	Mind if I join you?
M	LUKE	Sure.
M	LUKE	Your father said... that I would start to remember things.
F	ADELE	What... do you remember?
M	LUKE	Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
F	ADELE	I see...
M	LUKE	Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
F	ADELE	Oh...
F	ADELE	Oh, god, I knew! I knew! I knew from the start! I wanted you to be Luke! I wanted you to be alive! You're so much like him, you have no idea. No wonder everyone else accepted you! You don't know what you -- what Luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive! You don't know what this town lost! You just don't know...
F	ADELE	I knew you weren't Luke! And I tried not to fall in love with you! And... I don't even know your name! Oh, god...
M	LUKE	I fell in love with you, too, Delly. Only now I don't know how I feel, about you or about anything. I only think I know how Luke would feel.
M	LUKE	Delly, shhhhhh...
F	ADELE	No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
M	SAUNDERS	Are you the sheriff?
M	ELDRIDGE	And I got the uniform to prove it.
M	SAUNDERS	I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders, this is Special Agent Steven Brett, FBI. May we have a word with you?
M	ELDRIDGE	Please, sit.
M	SAUNDERS	A couple of days ago, a county flood control maintenance crew pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash ocean outlet. They checked its registration, and when the owner was identified, they notified us.
M	ELDRIDGE	Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo. Looks like you boys've solved a little mystery we've had going on for a few months.
M	BRETT	Sir, that's a photo of man named Peter Appleton. He's been missing from Los Angeles for close to three months now.
M	ELDRIDGE	What? No, there's got to be a...
M	SAUNDERS	Sheriff -- this man is a suspected communist.
M	PETE	Am I under arrest?
M	ELDRIDGE	Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
M	PETE	I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
M	SAUNDERS	Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
M	PETE	I already have.
M	SAUNDERS	Who?
M	PETE	My girlfriend. If she still is...
M	SAUNDERS	Would that be Miss Sinclair?
M	PETE	No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
M	ELDRIDGE	The doctor's daughter. She was Luke Trumbo's sweetheart.
M	SAUNDERS	Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist?
M	PETE	No. Absolutely not.
M	SAUNDERS	All right. All right. We'll see.
M	PETE	Let's close up.
M	PETE	Who's that?
M	ADELE'S VOICE	It's me.
F	ADELE	Hi.
M	PETE	Hi.
F	ADELE	I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
M	PETE	Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
M	PETE	This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
F	ADELE	Oh, yes. Yes, he was.
M	PETE	Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much.
F	ADELE	You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. Pete. Pete. It's a nice name.
M	PETE	Thanks, I like it. I think.
M	PETE	Delly, I want to do the right thing.
F	ADELE	I believe you.
M	PETE	The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
F	ADELE	But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
M	PETE	Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
F	ADELE	Forget about all that. You want to do the right thing? Then defend your name. If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so. I know the law, and the law's on your side.
M	PETE	What about you, Delly?
F	ADELE	I am, too.
M	PETE	You'll stand by me?
F	ADELE	Whatever happens.
M	RORY	Whatsit, girl?
M	RORY	Shhhhh. I know, Lottie. This time, I thought it was the Martians for sure.
M	REPORTER	I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals. Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time?
F	MABEL	Well, its kinds hard to believe, 'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is such a... I mean, since he's been back, I've never seen the town so happy and all. It's like he gave us some... I don't know... some hope, I guess.
M	REPORTER	What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story. Not only is Appleton alive, but he's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson, where, due to a startling resemblance, everyone in town for the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson's dead war heroes, Albert Trumbo...
F	MABEL	Luke. We always called him Luke.
M	LEO	The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
M	PETE	Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
M	LEO	However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
M	PETE	And I won't be a communist anymore.
M	LEO	Exactly.
M	PETE	So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
M	LEO	Kid, don't get philosophical with me. This is a game, but it's not your game. You play by their rules, or they'll ruin you. And they have the power to do it.
F	ADELE	Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?
M	LEO	Darling, don't kid yourself. We don't have a "democracy" in this country. The Declaration of Independence? The Constitution? These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em. And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is? It's a contract. And you know what a contract is? Something that can be re-negotiated at any time. It just so happens that the House Un-American Activities Committee is re-negotiating the contract this time around.
M	LEO	Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it.
M	PETE	That's not the country Luke fought for.
M	LEO	Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
M	PETE	It's wrong, Leo.
M	LEO	Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
M	LEO	Here. When you're called, read this to them. Just tell the bastards what they want to hear, and we can all get on with our lives.
M	THE MAN	Peter Appleton?
M	PETE	You found him.
M	THE MAN	Peter Appleton, you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. You are to appear in Los Angeles, California, at the Biltmore Hotel, at the date and time specified herein.
M	PETE	This is a great honor. I'll treasure this always. Thank you.
M	PETE	"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby renounce my membership in the American Communist Party, and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion, wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee, so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as I have done..."
M	PETE	Jesus...
M	PETE	Old Tim?
M	OLD TIM	Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
M	PETE	Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
M	PETE	Please, sit.
M	OLD TIM	Thanks.
M	OLD TIM	They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
M	PETE	The customers? I don't know...
M	OLD TIM	They will. They w-w-will.
M	PETE	Tim, I have to tell you something.
M	OLD TIM	Oh.
M	PETE	It's about me.
M	OLD TIM	Oh.
M	PETE	I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
M	OLD TIM	Oh...
M	PETE	My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
M	OLD TIM	Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
M	PETE	I thought you...
M	OLD TIM	I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g- g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here.
M	OLD TIM	You hafta give us back the B-B-Bijou.
F	ADELE	You've got everything?
M	PETE	Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
F	ADELE	You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that.
M	PETE	I wish you were coming with me.
F	ADELE	And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
M	PETE	Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
M	CONDUCTOR	Board!
F	ADELE	Did you bring along something to read?
M	PETE	Damn...
F	ADELE	I didn't think so. Here. This is mine, you can borrow it. ANNOTATED EDITION
F	ADELE	Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
M	PETE	Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this.
F	ADELE	Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
M	PETE	Okay. What's the second thing?
F	ADELE	I'll be here... if you come back.
F	ADELE	That's perfect, Dad.
M	DOYLE (ON TV)	The committee and the chamber will come to order.
M	LARDNER	This television's a grand little invention, isn't it?
M	DOYLE	The agenda for this morning's special session of the House Committee on Un- American Activities shows a number of witnesses, and I'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times, or this chamber will be closed. I'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press. I hope that's clear.
M	DOYLE	Call Peter Appleton.
M	DOYLE	The witness will please stand and raise his right hand.
M	DOYLE	Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
M	PETE	I do.
M	DOYLE	Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
M	PETE	Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.
M	DOYLE	The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
M	PETE	I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
M	DOYLE	Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
M	PETE	A statement?
M	DOYLE	Yes. A prepared statement.
M	PETE	Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
F	MRS. TERWILLIGER	I think he's doing very well, so far.
F	ADELE	They haven't called out the dogs yet.
M	DOYLE	Very well then, the questions will be asked by the Majority Counsel, Mr. Clyde.
F	ADELE	I spoke too soon. Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. Appleton, for appearing today.
M	CLYDE	Mr. Appleton, you mention that your home is Hollywood, California. But isn't it true that for the last several months, you've made your home in a town called Lawson, California?
M	PETE	Sir, that is true.
M	CLYDE	Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
M	PETE	Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
M	CLYDE	Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
M	PETE	Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
M	CLYDE	Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
M	PETE	Yes, sir.
M	CLYDE	Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
M	CLYDE (ON RADIO)	Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
M	PETE (ON RADIO)	Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
M	CLYDE	Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
M	PETE	Yes.
M	CLYDE	And what is the state of your memory now?
M	PETE	I'm sorry, what was the question?
M	CLYDE	We... appreciate... your little note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention. That state of your memory now, Mr. Appleton?
M	PETE	Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
M	CLYDE	I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
M	PETE	Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
M	CLYDE	Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
M	PETE	Yes... yes, I do.
M	CLYDE	Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
M	PETE	Yes it does.
M	CLYDE	Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
M	PETE	Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?
M	CLYDE	Start with what you knew then.
M	PETE	Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty- six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
M	CLYDE	We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
M	PETE	Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.
M	CLYDE	Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
M	PETE	Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
M	PETE	You asked for the truth. That's the truth. I had no idea what the meeting was about. I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.
M	DOYLE	Chamber will come to order.
M	CLYDE	All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
M	PETE	Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
M	CLYDE	Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
M	PETE	I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am! I know that I...
M	DOYLE	Mr. Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress. You will not be warned again, is that clear? Continue, Mr. Clyde.
M	CLYDE	Mr. Appleton...
M	CLYDE	Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
M	PETE	No, sir.
M	CLYDE	Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
M	PETE	I'm not refuting anything.
M	CLYDE	Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
M	PETE	That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
M	CLYDE	Well, then, as what did you go?
M	PETE	I'm a little hesitant to say.
M	DOYLE	The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
M	PETE	Well, I went as... a horny young man.
M	ELDRIDGE	Damn, he don't wanna spar with these boys. They'll eat him alive.
M	DOYLE	Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
M	PETE	I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
M	CLYDE	Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, the witness is making another speech. I would ask that Mr. Appleton be admonished...
M	DOYLE	Mr. Appleton, there is no question before you at this time, but I'm sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more prepared, and if you'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment, we can at least get on with the business of this committee.
F	ADELE	Tell them Pete. Tell them... Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self- incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
M	CLYDE	Mr. Chairman...
M	DOYLE	Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what is your intention?
M	PETE	I... Mr. Chairman, I have a prepared statement I'd like to read...
F	ADELE	Her hand goes to her mouth.
F	ADELE	Oh, Pete. No...
M	DOYLE	Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.
M	PETE	"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."
M	DOYLE	Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
M	PETE	I... I need a drink of water.
M	DOYLE	Go ahead, son.
M	PETE	Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.
M	DOYLE	Mr. Appleton, you will...
M	PETE	"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
M	PETE	That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman. It's the backbone of this nation. It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential. It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear. It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country. And even though this contract... ...the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation. Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever.
M	PETE	And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee. Good morning.
M	DOYLE	The witness will resume his seat! Did you hear me?! You are not excused, Mr. Appleton!
M	CLYDE	Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman...!
M	FIRST REPORTER	There he is!
M	SECOND REPORTER	Pete! Are you going back to writing pictures?
M	PETE	I don't know...
M	THIRD REPORTER	You a commie, Pete?
M	PETE	No, of course not...
M	SECOND REPORTER	What about the girl, Pete? You gonna marry her? Is she coming to Hollywood, or are you...
M	PETE	Look, fellas, I don't have anything to say...
M	LEO	Come on, kid.
M	LEO	That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
M	PETE	I'm not sorry for what I said.
M	LEO	No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble.
M	LEO	Cigarette?
M	PETE	No thanks.
M	LEO	When'd you quit smoking?
M	PETE	Luke didn't smoke.
M	LEO	Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
M	PETE	Not any more.
M	LEO	Why not?
M	PETE	Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
M	LEO	Not at all.
M	PETE	Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
M	LEO	What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
M	LEO	Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
M	PETE	What do you mean?
M	LEO	Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
M	PETE	Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
M	LEO	What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
M	PETE	Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
M	LEO	Well, that's not what they think.
M	PETE	Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
M	LEO	You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
M	PETE	Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
M	LEO	So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
M	PETE	Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?
M	LEO	Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
M	LEO	All of which means... "Ashes To Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back. Congratulations, kid.
M	LEO	Peter! Your hat!
M	LEO	I was lookin' out for you all the time, kid. You did good. I'm real proud of you. Okay, let's go. Get some rest, kid!
M	SUPER	Here's a new key for ya. That Mr. Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month. You got one swell friend there.
M	SUPER	Good to have you back, Pete.
M	PETE	Thanks...
M	PETE	Western Union, please.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	Dear Adele, on my way back to Lawson STOP. That is, if they'll have me STOP. Train arrives four p.m. STOP. Hope you can be there STOP. Pete.
M	WELCOME HOME PETE!	LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON
M	BOB	Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me.
M	PETE	Bob, congratulations! When'd you ask her?
F	MABEL	Holy moley! Just now! Yes, Bob! Yes!
M	PETE	I see you got the telegram.
F	ADELE	Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
M	PETE	Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
F	ADELE	And I love you, Pete!
M	PETE	C'mon, Dell, we gotta go. Showtime in fifteen minutes.
M	PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)	"Happily ever after" is a relative term, folks. My world is much smaller now, and my dreams are very different than they were. But I have something now that I never had before: I have the magic. And it's for sale at the Bijou, every day of the year. All you need is the price of a ticket.
