The rest of us weren't eating.. .we couldn't sleep.. .Every- thing was falling apart. It was snowing outside. The house was cold. I threw some logs on the fire.--..That's when I noticed the smell. The firemen came. They broke through the chimney top. We were all waiting, expecting them to pull out some dead cat or bird... Instead, they pulled out my Father. He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit. He had been climbing down the chimney on Christmas Eve, his arms loaded with presents. He was going to surprise us. The coroner said that he lost his footing. He slipped and broke his neck. Died instantly. His body was lodged in the narrow chimney shaft. ,That how I found out there was no Sahta Claus. Everyone has a chilled look on their faces.

M	GARY I	You know where they are, Peltzer?
M	BILLY	No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there.
