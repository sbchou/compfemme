M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	God, she's beautiful.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	She's got the prettiest eyes, and she looks so sexy in that sweater.
F	LEE	Hi, how are you?
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	I just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her...
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	...and tell her how much I love her and take care of her. Stop it, you idiot. She's your wife's sister. But I can't help it.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	I'm consumed by her. It's been months now. I dream about her. I- I, I think about her at the office. Oh, Lee. What am I gonna do?
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	I hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting. Before, when she... ...squeezed past me in the doorway, and I smelled that perfume on the back of her neck...
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna swoon! Easy...
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	You're a dignified financial advisor. It doesn't look good for you to swoon.
F	HANNAH	Elliot? Elliot? Sweetheart?
M	ELLIOT	Mm-hm?
F	HANNAH	Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.
M	ELLIOT	They're fantastic.
F	HANNAH	Aren't they great?
M	ELLIOT	Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
F	HANNAH	I know! I know!
F	HANNAH	She has all the cooking talent.
M	ELLIOT	No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
F	HANNAH	Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
M	ELLIOT	Holly, why don't you open your own restaurant?
F	HOLLY	Mmm, we practically are. Well... not a restaurant, but... April and I are going to do some catering!
F	HANNAH	What? You're kidding!
F	HOLLY	No, no, we decided!
F	HANNAH	Perfect!
F	HOLLY	Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
M	ELLIOT	Great idea.
F	HANNAH	I know.
M	ELLIOT	That's where your talent lies.
F	HOLLY	I know.
F	HOLLY	Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately?
F	HANNAH	Oh, sure.
M	ELLIOT	I'm her husband! She tells me anything!
F	HOLLY	Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset.
F	HANNAH	Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
F	HOLLY	This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
F	HANNAH	Holly, please. Don't insult me.
F	HOLLY	Someday, I'll pay it all back.
F	HANNAH	I know. H-how much do you need?
F	HOLLY	Two thousand dollars.
F	HANNAH	Uh-huh.
F	HOLLY	Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
F	HOLLY	You admit that we're great cooks, right?
F	HANNAH	Yeah.
F	HOLLY	Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding.
F	HANNAH	Will you just tell me one thing?
F	HOLLY	Okay.
F	HANNAH	Are we talking about cocaine again?
F	HOLLY	I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
F	HOLLY	I mean, obviously, I'm not going to be a caterer forever, you know. We both still go to auditions. Something could turn up at any moment. But the parties are at night, days are free, I can still take my acting class. I haven't done drugs on a year.
M	EVAN & NORMA	"A whimpering, simpering Child again Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered Am I..."
F	LEE	Mom and Dad are floating down memory lane again!
F	HANNAH	Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
F	LEE	I think they're fantastic.
F	HANNAH	You've outdone yourself.
F	HOLLY	Oh, my God. Thank you.
F	LEE	I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
F	HANNAH	Ohh?
F	HOLLY	Uh-oh.
F	LEE	...before she starts turning into Camille...
F	HOLLY	Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
F	LEE	At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
F	HOLLY	Mm-hm.
F	HANNAH	Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
F	LEE	Yeah.
F	HANNAH	Don't you think she does?
F	HOLLY	She really does, though.
F	LEE	Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
F	HOLLY	God.
F	HANNAH	Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
F	HOLLY	I should get a garter belt.
F	LEE	Yeah.
F	HOLLY	Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt.
F	LEE	Where are the antihistamines?
F	HANNAH	Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
F	LEE	Okay.
F	HOLLY	Frederick didn't come with her.
F	HANNAH	When does Frederick ever come with her?
F	HOLLY	Tch. He's such an angry... he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!
M	EVAN & NORMA	"A pill he is But still he is All mine and I'll Keep him until he is Bewitched, a'both--"
F	HANNAH	Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep!
F	HOLLY	Oh, your kids are so adorable.
M	CHILDREN	Bye! Bye!
F	HOLLY	God, it gets so lonely on the holidays.
F	HANNAH	Oh, gosh. Well, you know, that's why I invited Phil Gammage tonight.
F	HOLLY	Oh, Hannah!
F	HANNAH	It's, uh, you never know--
F	HOLLY	He's such a loser!
F	HANNAH	He's not a loser at all!
F	HOLLY	Oh, he's such a loser!
F	HANNAH	He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
F	HOLLY	Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited.
F	HANNAH	Listen. He's a lot better than your ex-husband. He's got a good job. Would you light those, please? He's- he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
F	HOLLY	Give me a break.
F	APRIL	Am I interrupting...
F	APRIL	...any sister talk?
F	HANNAH	Mm-mm!
F	HOLLY	Come in.
F	APRIL	Oh, good...
F	HANNAH	Come in, come in.
F	APRIL	...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
F	HANNAH	Oh, listen...
F	HOLLY	I know. It's terrible!
F	APRIL	I mean, I've looked everywhere.
F	HANNAH	Maybe April would like Phil. Phil Gammage, the tall guy in there by the piano.
F	APRIL	Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.
F	HANNAH	Mmm?
F	APRIL	He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
F	APRIL	I love that. That's my type.
F	HANNAH	I can't believe it!
F	APRIL	No, really, I really like him a lot.
F	HOLLY	No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
F	HOLLY	Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
F	APRIL	Mmm.
F	HOLLY	Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
F	HANNAH	Here. Be careful with those.
F	HOLLY	Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
F	HOLLY	Ouch!
F	HANNAH	Oh!
M	ELLIOT	Must be here someplace.
F	LEE	Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me. The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for me.
M	ELLIOT	How's Frederick? He didn't come.
F	LEE	Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods. Although it wasn't a bad week. He uh, sold a picture.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, great.
F	LEE	Yeah, it was, it was one of his better drawings, a very beautiful nude study. Actually, it was of me. It's funny, you know, it's a funny feeling to know you're being hung naked in some stranger's living room.
F	LEE	Well, you can't tell it's me, although-- You're turning all red, Elliot.
M	ELLIOT	Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to?
F	LEE	Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
M	ELLIOT	Like, uh...?
F	LEE	I don't know exactly.
F	LEE	Uh, sociology, psychology maybe. I always thought I might like to work with children.
M	ELLIOT	Incidentally, I-I always have clients who are furnishing places. Some of them might-might be interested in buying art. Shall I, shall I call you?
F	LEE	Yeah, sure. You know, uh, Frederick would really by grateful for a sale.
F	HANNAH	Hey, you guys?
F	HANNAH	Dinner's ready.
F	LEE	Oh, great.
F	HANNAH	You look so beautiful.
F	LEE	Come on.
F	HANNAH	Doesn't she look pretty?
F	LEE	I bumped into your...
M	ELLIOT	Yeah.
F	LEE	...ex-husband on the street the other day.
F	HANNAH	Oh, yeah?
F	LEE	He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
F	HANNAH	God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
M	ELLIOT	Let's go have dinner, shall we?
F	HANNAH	Mmm.
F	LEE	Good idea.
M	EVAN	Now, ladies and gentlemen...
F	HOLLY	Dad.
F	HOLLY	Dad...
F	LEE	Oh...
F	HOLLY	Dad!
M	EVAN	No, now...
F	HOLLY	I'm starving!
M	EVAN	...this is a toast! This is a toast.
F	HANNAH	Get his wine away.
M	EVAN	This is a toast. You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
M	EVAN	...prepared... by Hannah.
F	HANNAH	Uh, and a little help...
F	NORMA	Hey!
F	HANNAH	...from Mavis, also.
M	ELLIOT	You bet.
F	HANNAH	down the table while still in Elliot's Holly and April, thanks for helping.
M	EVAN	No, you did it.
F	HOLLY	April, April!
F	HANNAH	I am... I did slave all day.
M	EVAN	And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year... her great success in A Doll's House!
F	NORMA	Ya-a-a-a-y! I played Nora. I hate to tell you what year...
F	NORMA	And it's very difficult to behave like Torvald's little chipmunk without making a perfect ass out of yourself! Now I think that Ibsen would have been damn proud of our Hannah!
F	APRIL	Speech! Speech! Speech!
F	NORMA	Yea-a-a-a-ah!
F	HANNAH	I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy But... I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
M	EVAN	Yeah.
F	HANNAH	...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
M	EVAN	Oh, bravo! Bravo!
M	LEE (V.O.)	Is it my imagination, or does Elliot have a little crush on me? It's funny. I've had that thought before. He pays a lot of attention to me all the time, and he blushed tonight when we were alone in the bedroom. I wonder if he and Hannah are happy? It's funny, I... I still feel a little buzz from his flirting.
F	LEE	Want some coffee or tea?
M	FREDERICK	No, thank you.
F	LEE	How about something to eat?
M	FREDERICK	No, nothing.
F	LEE	Are you sure?
M	FREDERICK	Absolutely.
F	LEE	Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
F	LEE	God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
M	FREDERICK	I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
F	LEE	You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
M	FREDERICK	Lee... you are the only person I can be with... who I really look forward to being with.
F	LEE	You're too harsh with everyone. You know that, don't you?
M	FREDERICK	Isn't it enough that I can love you?
F	LEE	Mmm...
M	FREDERICK	Hmm?
F	LEE	...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so... contemptuous of everyone else.
M	FREDERICK	Well, there was a time when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
F	LEE	Mm-hm.
M	FREDERICK	Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so.
F	LEE	Oh, Elliot said he might have a couple of clients for you.
M	FREDERICK	I'm sure all those morons he handles have a deep feeling for art.
F	LEE	
M	MMM	you never know. They might. He's just trying to do the nice thing.
M	FREDERICK	Because he likes you.
F	LEE	Me?
M	FREDERICK	Yeah.
M	FREDERICK	Elliot lusts after you.
F	LEE	Based on what? You never even see him.
M	FREDERICK	Based on... whenever you see him, you always come home full of books he's recommended...
M	FREDERICK	...or films you must see or...
F	LEE	Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's husband. And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
M	FREDERICK	He's a glorified accountant, and he's after you. And I prefer to sell my work to people who appreciate it, not to rock stars. You understand?
F	LEE	Ohhh!
F	MICKEY	What do you mean, they won't let us do the sketch?
M	PAUL	Talk to Standards and Practices. They think it's too dirty.
F	MICKEY	But we showed it to them in rehearsal!
F	MICKEY	You know, what'd they do, figure out what the words mean?
F	MARY	Mickey, we got a half hour to air!
M	LARRY	We're short! The show is five minutes short!
F	MICKEY	How could it be short? We timed
M	everything	long.
M	PAUL	If we have to...
M	PAUL	...pull out the sketch, then we'll be ten minutes short!
F	MICKEY	I don't know how they can do that to us. That's-- We go on in thirty minutes, right?
M	LARRY	They're doing it because our ratings are low.
F	MICKEY	I got such a migraine.
F	GAIL	Hey, Mickey!
F	GAIL	Mickey! Listen, we better go right to Ronny's dressing room. This kid must have taken sixteen hundred Quaaludes. I don't think he's going to be able to do the show!
F	MICKEY	Why me, Lord? What did I--
F	MICKEY	You-- Standards and Practices?
M	ED	Ed Smythe, yes.
F	MICKEY	Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
M	ED	Child molestation is a touchy subject...
F	MICKEY	Could you--
M	ED	...with the affiliates.
F	MICKEY	Read the papers! Half the country's doing it!
M	ED	Yes, but you name names.
F	MICKEY	We nev-- We don't name names! touching her We say the Pope.
F	GAIL	We always say the Pope!
M	ED	That sketch...
F	MICKEY	We--
M	ED	...cannot go on the air.
F	MICKEY	Oh, Je--
M	WRITER	Hey!
M	WRITER	Who changed my sketch about the PLO?
F	MICKEY	I had to make some cuts. It's four lousy lines!
M	WRITER	The whole premise is ruined!
F	MICKEY	Oh, you're crazy! It's not so delicate. Everybody's married to every line.
F	GAIL	Mickey, I can--
M	WRITER	I don't care! I don't want anyone tampering with my goddamn work without telling me!
F	MICKEY	Okay.
M	WRITER	You want 'em cut?! I'll cut 'em myself!
F	MICKEY	All right, all right.
F	GAIL	attention and Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
F	MICKEY	You know...
F	GAIL	In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
F	MICKEY	No--
M	RON	I don't feel good, Mickey.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do? Swallow a drugstore?!
F	MICKEY	Look at this guy.
F	GAIL	Yeah?
M	RON	I lost my voice.
F	MICKEY	Oh, Jesus!
F	GAIL	Ron... Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
F	MICKEY	Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet? My, my ulcer's starting to kill me!
M	RON	You want a Quaalude?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Christ, this show is ruining my health! Meanwhile, my ex-partner moves to California and every stupid show he produces turns out to be a big hit. Brother, what am I gonna do with my life? Speaking of that, I-I... gotta remember to see my ex- wife tomorrow. Tch.
F	HANNAH	Hi! Hi!
F	MICKEY	I know... I know.
F	HANNAH	Glad you could put in an appearance.
F	MICKEY	I got two minutes.
F	HANNAH	Very good.
F	MICKEY	I got two minutes. 'Cause, God, the show is killing me. I got a million appointments today. It just so happens it fell this way.
F	MICKEY	I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
F	HANNAH	Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
F	MICKEY	Happy Birthday, fellas! Happy Birthday!
F	HANNAH	Guys, look what Daddy brought. Presents!
F	MICKEY	Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
F	HANNAH	Huh?
F	MICKEY	...a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
F	MICKEY	How is everything?
F	HANNAH	Everything's good. Everything's fine.
F	MICKEY	Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
F	HANNAH	Here, you guys. Open them up.
F	MICKEY	Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot?
F	HANNAH	He's fine.
F	MICKEY	Yeah?
F	HANNAH	Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
F	MICKEY	Oh!
F	HANNAH	I think he'll find that satisfying.
F	MICKEY	Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think.
F	HANNAH	I think so.
F	MICKEY	I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
F	HANNAH	Yeah.
F	MICKEY	The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?
M	TWIN #1	Thank you, Daddy.
F	MICKEY	'Cause he's a loser.
F	HANNAH	Ohh!
F	MICKEY	H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
F	HANNAH	I know, I know.
F	MICKEY	...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person...
F	HANNAH	That's really nice!
F	MICKEY	...you know? I, uh...
F	HANNAH	You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
F	MICKEY	You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
F	HANNAH	Thanks, thanks.
F	MICKEY	Mh-hm.
F	HANNAH	That's a beauty!
F	MICKEY	Isn't that great?
F	HANNAH	Oh!
F	MICKEY	Go right over there.
F	HANNAH	Football!
F	MICKEY	Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!
F	HANNAH	Wow!
F	MICKEY	Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
F	MICKEY	See?
F	HANNAH	Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Gee, Hannah's sweet. Although, sometimes I still do get angry when I think of things. Oh, what the hell. At least, I'm not paying child support. Oh, God, I hope there's nothing physically wrong with me, either.
M	DR. ABEL	So what's the, uh, problem this time?
F	MICKEY	This time I really think I have something.
F	MICKEY	I mean, I'm absolutely convinced that-that-- You know, I mean, it's not like that adenoidal thing, you know, where I didn't realize I had them out.
F	MICKEY	So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
M	DR. ABEL	You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
F	MICKEY	Mm-hm.
M	DR. ABEL	...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
F	MICKEY	Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's--
M	DR. ABEL	You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
F	MICKEY	Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear ...or my left ear, my, my left... oh, n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
F	MICKEY	Now I ca-can't remember.
M	DR. ABEL	Let's take a look.
M	DR. ABEL	Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
F	MICKEY	Really?!
M	DR. ABEL	Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
F	MICKEY	No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
F	MICKEY	I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
M	DR. ABEL	When did you first notice this?
F	MICKEY	Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have?
M	DR. ABEL	You've had some dizzy spells. What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
F	MICKEY	Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
M	DR. ABEL	And it's just in one ear?
F	MICKEY	Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
M	DR. ABEL	What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
F	MICKEY	The hospital? What kind of tests?
M	DR. ABEL	Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing.
F	MICKEY	Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
M	DR. ABEL	You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things.
F	MICKEY	Like what?
M	DR. ABEL	It's nothing. Will you trust me?
F	MICKEY	Huh, uh, hello, Dr. Wilkes? Dr. Wilkes, this is Mickey Sachs. You have a minute? I want to ask you a question.
M	DR. WILKES	Sure, Mickey. What's up?
F	MICKEY	I-if you have, i-if you have a hearing loss in one ear, and-and it's not from a, uh, virus or a loud noise or anything, wh-what are the possibilities?
M	DR. WILKES	Anything. Uh, often it's hereditary. Flu, uh, even a small noise will do it.
F	MICKEY	Uh, right, but-but nothing worse?
M	DR. WILKES	Well, yes, I guess the, uh, dark side of the spectrum is a brain tumor.
F	MICKEY	Really?
F	GAIL	Okay, so here's the new pages.
M	WOMAN	Say, did cards get these?
F	GAIL	No, not yet. No.
M	MAN	Well, let's hope it's good.
F	GAIL	Yeah, really. Really.
F	GAIL	Eh, we'll be down in a minute, okay?
F	GAIL	Mickey, what's the matter with you? You're all white!
F	MICKEY	I feel dizzy. Sshh, you know, I don't feel well.
F	MICKEY	Do you hear a ringing? Is there, is there a, is there a ringing sound?
F	GAIL	Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hear, I hear it.
F	MICKEY	N-n-no, not that.
F	GAIL	Hello?
F	MICKEY	Like--
F	GAIL	Uh, yeah, yeah. We're going to be working late tonight. N-no, we'll order out. It's all right. Yeah.
F	MICKEY	Sssss, if I have a brain tumor, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
F	GAIL	You don't have a brain tumor. He didn't say you had a brain tumor.
F	MICKEY	No, naturally they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
F	GAIL	But not you.
F	MICKEY	Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
F	GAIL	Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
F	MICKEY	I can't keep my mind on the show.
F	GAIL	But there's nothing wrong with you.
F	MICKEY	If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
F	GAIL	Well, he has to rule out certain things.
F	MICKEY	Like what?! What?
F	GAIL	I don't know. Cancer, I--
F	MICKEY	Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
F	GAIL	But you don't have any symptoms!
F	MICKEY	You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
F	GAIL	Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
F	MICKEY	Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
F	GAIL	It was on your shirt!
F	MICKEY	I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here.
F	GAIL	Come on, we've got to make some booking decisions.
F	MICKEY	I can't. I can't think of it. This morning, I was so happy, you know. Now I, I don't know what went wrong.
F	GAIL	Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
F	MICKEY	No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
M	FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST	These things are delicious! What in the world are they?
F	HOLLY	Oh, um, those are quail eggs.
M	FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST	Oh, they're very good.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, my friend April makes those. Here, try the shrimp puffs. These are delicious.
M	FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST	Oh, thank you. That looks great.
F	HOLLY	I make those.
M	FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST	Mmm. Thanks.
F	HOLLY	Excuse me.
F	HOLLY	Thank you.
F	APRIL	The Stroganoff is ready.
F	HOLLY	We're a big hit.
F	APRIL	Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a big hit.
F	HOLLY	You will be. You will be. You'll get five jobs next week.
M	DAVID	Excuse me, are there any more clams?
F	HOLLY	Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
M	DAVID	I can't resist.
F	HOLLY	Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
M	DAVID	Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
F	HOLLY	We're actresses.
M	DAVID	Is this your first job?
F	HOLLY	Really? Is the food that bad?
M	DAVID	Oh no. Not at all.
F	APRIL	We need more bread and some baked lasa-- there and, at the uh, lasagne. Hi.
M	DAVID	and mouth with a I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
F	APRIL	Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
M	DAVID	And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
F	APRIL	Well, let's hope so.
F	HOLLY	Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
M	DAVID	Ah!
F	HOLLY	Now.
M	DAVID	Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.
F	APRIL	Oh, uh, April Knox. Hi.
M	DAVID	Hi.
F	APRIL	Oh.
F	HOLLY	I'm sorry.
M	DAVID	You're Holly.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
M	DAVID	Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
F	HOLLY	What makes you think we're more interesting?
M	DAVID	Actually, I'm going to listen to Aida, if I'm not getting in your way.
F	APRIL	No... no. No--
F	HOLLY	Not at all.
F	HOLLY	We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
M	DAVID	I cry at the opera.
F	APRIL	Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene in La Traviata. Limp.
M	DAVID	Me, too. I have a private box at the Met. I bring my little bottle of wine, I open it, I sit there and I watch and I cry. It's disgusting.
F	HOLLY	Oh, what, what do you do?
M	DAVID	I'm an architect.
F	APRIL	Wha-- What kind of things do you build?
M	DAVID	Are you really interested?
F	APRIL	Yeah.
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
M	DAVID	What time do you get off?
F	HOLLY	Wow, it's the red one?
F	APRIL	Oh, it's magnificent!
M	DAVID	Yeah.
F	HOLLY	It's terrific!
M	DAVID	back and forth from The design's deliberately noncontextural. But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
F	HOLLY	Uh-huh.
M	DAVID	And in the material. That's... that's unpolished red granite.
F	HOLLY	Oh!
F	APRIL	Oh, is that what it is?
F	HOLLY	Uh--
F	APRIL	I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
F	HOLLY	Right.
F	APRIL	It's almost... almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is- is-is it-it breathes.
M	DAVID	You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
F	APRIL	Oh--
F	HOLLY	Oh, it's really important.
F	APRIL	What are your favorite buildings, David?
M	DAVID	You want to see some?
F	APRIL	Oh, yeah.
M	DAVID	Well, let's do it.
F	APRIL	Great.
F	HOLLY	Oh, it's just so romantic. I just want to put on a long gown...
M	DAVID	Yes.
F	HOLLY	...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
F	APRIL	It's French, though. It really is.
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
F	APRIL	It feels like you're in France.
M	DAVID	It-it is. It's romantic.
M	DAVID	And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
M	DAVID	They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
F	APRIL	That's just --
M	DAVID	Look at this.
F	HOLLY	That's disgusting!
F	APRIL	...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
F	HOLLY	It's really terrible.
M	DAVID	It's really sad.
F	HOLLY	And it ruins everything else.
M	DAVID	It does.
F	APRIL	Well... we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
M	DAVID	Yeah.
F	APRIL	A lot of works.
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
M	DAVID	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
F	HOLLY	Fast.
F	APRIL	Oh, geez, yeah.
F	HOLLY	Okay.
M	DAVID	Uh, who gets dropped first?
F	APRIL	Uh --
F	HOLLY	Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...
M	DAVID	Well...
F	APRIL	Well, I live downtown.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
F	APRIL	Uh...
F	HOLLY	It depends on what way you want to go.
F	APRIL	Well, wait. You know what? I know.
F	HOLLY	Uh...
F	APRIL	If... well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
M	DAVID	We could... we could do that.
F	HOLLY	Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
F	APRIL	Well, sometimes, some, uh...
F	HOLLY	I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...
M	DAVID	Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
F	HOLLY	Yes.
M	DAVID	Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
F	HOLLY	Oh, okay.
F	APRIL	Yeah.
M	DAVID	And then, uh, April... huh?
F	APRIL	Great.
M	HOLLY (V.O.)	Naturally I get taken home first. Well, obviously he prefers April. Of course I was so tongue-tied all night. I can't believe I said that about the Guggenheim. My stupid little roller-skating joke. I should never tell jokes. Mom can tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em. Where did April come up with that stuff about Adolph Loos and terms like "organic form"? Well, naturally. She went to Brandeis.
M	HOLLY (V.O.)	But I don't think she knows what she's talking about. Could you believe the way she was calling him David? "Yes, David. I feel that way, too, David. What a marvelous space, David." I hate April. She's pushy.
M	HOLLY (V.O.)	Now they'll dump me and she'll invite him up. I blew it. And I really like him a lot. Oh, screw it. I'm not gonna get all upset. I've got reading to do tonight. You know, maybe I'll get into bed early. I'll turn to a movie and take an extra Seconal.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, my goodness!
F	LEE	Oh, Elliot!
M	ELLIOT	Hi.
F	LEE	What are you doing here?
M	ELLIOT	Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
F	LEE	Oh, what, in this section of town?
M	ELLIOT	Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill--
F	LEE	You're out looking here?
M	ELLIOT	Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have a client near here and I... I'm quite early.
F	LEE	Ohhhh!
M	ELLIOT	How about you?
F	LEE	Oh. Well, I live--
M	ELLIOT	Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?
F	LEE	Yes, I do.
M	ELLIOT	Where are you headed?
F	LEE	Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never touch alcohol.
F	LEE	Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick. I'd... I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and... go on.
M	ELLIOT	Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
F	LEE	Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
M	ELLIOT	I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
F	LEE	Oh, God.
M	ELLIOT	I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
F	LEE	Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore.
M	ELLIOT	Yes?
F	LEE	A couple of blocks from here. If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
M	ELLIOT	Yes?
F	LEE	Yeah, you would.
M	ELLIOT	Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
F	LEE	Yeah, sure.
M	ELLIOT	Thank you.
F	LEE	Isn't this great? They have everything here.
M	ELLIOT	Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
F	LEE	What book did you want to buy?
M	ELLIOT	What? Book?
F	LEE	Your book? You wanted to buy a book?
M	ELLIOT	Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I... I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
F	LEE	Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
M	ELLIOT	Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
F	LEE	No, I don't have time.
M	ELLIOT	No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I- I...
F	LEE	You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
M	ELLIOT	No! No...
F	LEE	No?
M	ELLIOT	Uh, yes!
F	LEE	Yes?
M	ELLIOT	Yes.
F	LEE	Everything's okay?
M	ELLIOT	Yeah. How are you?
F	LEE	I'm... all right.
M	ELLIOT	How-how's Frederick?
F	LEE	Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met. It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I mean... you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio?
M	ELLIOT	Oh, yes. Who doesn't? Look!
M	ELLIOT	e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this.
F	LEE	Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
F	LEE	No, I don't think so.
M	ELLIOT	I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last-- You'll be fine, though.
F	LEE	Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
M	ELLIOT	Yes, I'd... I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
F	LEE	Well, sure.
M	ELLIOT	And-and maybe, um... maybe we could discuss it sometime.
F	LEE	Well, thanks a lot.
M	ELLIOT	Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh... uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
F	LEE	Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it. It's really entertaining. You'd have a good time. I know you would.
M	ELLIOT	And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve. It reminded me of you.
F	LEE	Really? Well...
M	ELLIOT	Page a hundred and twelve.
F	LEE	Bye.
M	ELLIOT	Bye.
M	LEE (V.O.)	"your slightest look easily will unclose me though I have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself...
M	LEE (V.O.)	"...as Spring opens [touching skillfully, mysteriously] her first rose [i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses]...
M	LEE (V.O.)	"nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands."
M	DR. GREY	I wasn't too happy with the results of your ENG or your BSER either.
M	DR. GREY	Uh, which is why I sent you to Tomography, which was all that stuff you saw rolling around. You see this little gray area here?
M	DR. GREY	That gray area's what I had hoped that we wouldn't run into. I'd like you to come in Monday morning for, uh, a CAT scan.
F	MICKEY	A brain scan?
M	DR. GREY	Mr. Sachs, let's take one step at a time. We won't make any decisions until we have all the information in front of us, all right?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Okay... take it easy. He didn't say you had anything. He just doesn't like the spot on your X-ray, that's all. It doesn't mean you have anything. Don't jump to conclusions. Nothing's gonna happen to you. You're in the middle of New York City. This is your town. You're surrounded by people and traffic and restaurants.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	I mean, God, how can you, how can you just one day... vanish? Keep calm. You're gonna be okay. Don't panic.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	I'm dying! I'm dying! I know it! There's a spot on my lungs! All right now, take it easy, will you? It's not on your lungs. It's on your ear. No, it's the same thing, isn't it? Oh, jeez, I can't sleep! Oh, God, there's a tumor in my head the size of a basketball! N-now I keep thinking I can feel it every time I blink! Oh, Jesus! He- he-he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already suspects.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Look... I'll make a deal with God. Let it just be my ear, okay? I'll go deaf. I'll go deaf and blind in one eye maybe. But I don't want a brain operation! Once they go into my skull, I'll-I'll wind up like the guy with the, with the wool cap who delivers for the florist!
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Oh, relax, will ya? Your whole life you run to doctors. The news is always fine. That's not true. What about years ago?
M	DR. SMITH	I'm sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that you cannot have children.
F	MICKEY	Gee.
F	HANNAH	Is there no chance?
M	DR. SMITH	Well, naturally, this doesn't mean that you can't have a normal sex life. But Mr. Sachs's tests indicate that he is infertile. Small sperm volume and infertile.
F	MICKEY	Isn't there anything I can do? Push- ups or hormones?
M	DR. SMITH	I'm afraid not.
F	MICKEY	Well, I gotta get a second opinion.
F	HANNAH	This is the second opinion.
F	MICKEY	Well, then a third opinion.
M	DR. SMITH	I realize this is a blow. My experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem. I hope you won't make too much of it. One can adopt children, and there are various artificial methods of fertilization.
F	MICKEY	I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean--
F	HANNAH	Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
F	MICKEY	How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself?
F	HANNAH	I don't know. Excessive masturbation?
F	MICKEY	Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus!
F	MICKEY	Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
F	HANNAH	Well, what about artificial insemination?
F	MICKEY	What are you talking about?
F	HANNAH	You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
F	MICKEY	What, by a st-stranger?
F	HANNAH	Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
F	MICKEY	Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
F	HANNAH	I want to experience childbirth.
F	MICKEY	With a, with a stranger? With a--
F	HANNAH	Just think about it. That's all I ask.
F	CAROL	Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
M	NORMAN	No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
F	MICKEY	Yeah... I-I think as, I think as far as laughs, I mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing that we ever did.
M	NORMAN	Mm-hm.
F	CAROL	Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny. But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
M	NORMAN	We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
F	CAROL	Right.
M	NORMAN	Hmm?
F	CAROL	Do you remember that summer in France? Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess we had fun when we were there and, you know, it's just, I--
M	NORMAN	Mm-hm.
F	HANNAH	Sorry. Coffee? Listen, you guys, we were-- You want some more?
M	NORMAN	Mmm.
F	HANNAH	We-we... we had something we-we really wanted to discuss with you.
F	MICKEY	Yeah...
F	MICKEY	Jeez, this is, this is, this is very delicate and-and I only bring this up amongst friends, you know.
F	MICKEY	I mean... this is, uh... this should not go any further than this room.
M	NORMAN	I'm all ears.
F	MICKEY	Hannah and I... can't have any children. Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it-- It's my fault that we can't and- and- and the details are too embarrassing to--
F	HANNAH	W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, I'm not so sure that I, that I like that idea myself, anyway--
F	HANNAH	Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor. I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
F	MICKEY	Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
F	HANNAH	And you can say no... you know. Feel free to say no. W-we realize it has all kinds of implications.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, but the-the point that, uh, that we're making here is that we need some sperm.
M	NORMAN	Gee. Well... My first reaction after the initial shock is, uh, flattered that you would ask me.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, well, I would be the father. You would just have to masturbate into a little cup.
M	NORMAN	I can handle that.
F	HANNAH	Obviously we wou-wouldn't have intercourse.
F	CAROL	Gosh, listen. I've gotta tell you the truth here. I'm a little uneasy about this.
F	HANNAH	Carol, I know it's a lot to ask.
F	CAROL	Well... I feel for you. I do. I... I'm gonna cry. You want my husband to have a child with you?
F	HANNAH	Ye-- D-d-d-don't answer now. Just, you know, take it home and think about it for a while.
M	NORMAN	I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
F	CAROL	Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home. I think it's a matter for your analyst... and mine.
M	NORMAN	And maybe my lawyer.
F	HANNAH	You know, we-we understand completely if, you know, if you feel you'd-you'd rather not. I didn't mean to spoil the evening. Now let's move on to another topic.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins. Maybe that did cause some trouble, but I think we were drifting apart anyhow. Now instead of man and wife we're just good friends. Boy, love is really unpredictable.
M	ELLIOT	Lee, Frederick... say hello to Dusty Frye.
F	LEE	Hi, Dusty.
M	DUSTY	Hi.
M	ELLIOT	Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
M	DUSTY	Yeah. It's kind of a weird place, actually. A lotta wall space.
F	LEE	Oh.
M	DUSTY	How ya doin', man?
M	ELLIOT	I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
M	DUSTY	Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's very beautiful. Big, weird... you know. If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
F	LEE	Are you excited about becoming a collector?
M	DUSTY	Yeah.
F	LEE	Yeah?
M	DUSTY	I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
F	LEE	Uh-huh.
M	FREDERICK	Do you appreciate drawings?
M	DUSTY	Yeah. to some offscreen Oh! Hey! Wow! She's beautiful. But, uh, really, I- I-I-I need something... I'm looking for something big.
F	LEE	Big. Frederick, show him the oils.
M	FREDERICK	They're in the basement.
F	LEE	Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
M	DUSTY	Well, are... are they big?
F	LEE	Yeah. Some of them... yeah, some of them are very big.
M	DUSTY	'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
M	FREDERICK	I don't sell my work by the yard!
F	LEE	Oh, Frederick!
M	ELLIOT	How's everything?
F	LEE	Oh, you know... I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
M	ELLIOT	Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
F	LEE	Oh, yeah.
M	ELLIOT	But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
F	LEE	I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, that's nice.
M	ELLIOT	I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
F	LEE	Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
M	ELLIOT	Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
F	LEE	Oh.
M	ELLIOT	He's got like six gold records.
F	LEE	Oh, speaking of records... I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
F	LEE	...and the man in the record shop showed me another one that I think you'd love. It's a... another Bach, second movement.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, you-you have that one?
F	LEE	Yeah.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, I would love to hear it.
F	LEE	Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one.
F	LEE	Isn't that beautiful?
M	ELLIOT	I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
M	ELLIOT	Uh... did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
F	LEE	Yes, he's just adorable.
F	LEE	They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and... all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, right.
M	ELLIOT	Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
F	LEE	Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful... so romantic.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	I want so badly to kiss her. Not here, you idiot. You've got to get her alone someplace.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	But I've got to proceed cautiously. This is a very delicate situation. Okay, uh... ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
F	LEE	Did you ever read this one--?
F	LEE	Elliot! Don't!
M	ELLIOT	Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you.
M	ELLIOT	Oh!
F	LEE	What are you doing?!
M	ELLIOT	I... I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
F	LEE	Elliot!
M	ELLIOT	I have been in love with you for so long.
M	FREDERICK	Please forget it! I don't have any interest in selling anything!
M	DUSTY	I ask you if you have something with a little puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle!
F	LEE	What's the problem?
M	FREDERICK	I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
M	DUSTY	Well, I can't commit to anything without consulting her first. That's what I have her for, okay?
M	FREDERICK	This is degrading! You don't buy paintings to blend in with the sofa!
M	DUSTY	It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman! God, forget it! Let's just get outta here, Elliot.
M	ELLIOT	We'll go.
M	DUSTY	What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you?
M	ELLIOT	Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
M	DUSTY	It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off.
M	ELLIOT	Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
M	DUSTY	Are you okay? You look-- You're sweatin'.
M	ELLIOT	Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air. It's probably something I ate. I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
M	ELLIOT	You go. Go on. Go.
M	FREDERICK	Hello? Hello? Hello?
F	LEE	Oh! There you are!
F	LEE	I was looking for you.
M	ELLIOT	I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
F	LEE	Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
M	ELLIOT	Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
F	LEE	Oh, don't say those words!
M	ELLIOT	I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
F	LEE	Why, you know the situation.
M	ELLIOT	I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.
F	LEE	What do you expect me to say?
M	ELLIOT	Hannah and I are in the last stages.
F	LEE	Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing.
M	ELLIOT	Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
F	LEE	Not because of me, I hope.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
F	LEE	Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
M	ELLIOT	Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
F	LEE	Why?
M	ELLIOT	Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
F	LEE	But not over me?
M	ELLIOT	Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
F	LEE	Poor Hannah.
M	ELLIOT	But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
F	LEE	I can't say anything!
M	ELLIOT	W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
F	LEE	Yes! But I... I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
M	ELLIOT	O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.
F	LEE	Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
M	ELLIOT	Yes, but you, you do care about me.
F	LEE	Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
M	ELLIOT	Your guilt is because you feel the same.
F	LEE	Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned.
M	ELLIOT	I have my answer. I have my answer! I'm walking on air!
F	HANNAH	Hi. How's she doing?
M	EVAN	I am glad to see you.
M	EVAN	She's in the kitchen there. It's the same thing. Same thing. She promises, promises. But it's all lies.
F	HANNAH	Don't make it worse, Dad.
M	EVAN	Always.
F	HANNAH	Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it?
M	EVAN	We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
M	EVAN	...and your mother was throwing herself at him in a disgusting way, and when she found she was too old to seduce him, that he was just embarrassed by her--
F	NORMA	Liar! Liar!
M	EVAN	Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker and finally she became Joan Collins!
F	NORMA	All my life I've had to put up with insults...
F	NORMA	...from this non-person, this, th- th-this haircut that passes for a man. He could never support us. It's a good thing we had a talented daughter!
M	EVAN	I can only hope that she was mine. With you as her mother her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!
F	NORMA	She's talented... so it's not likely she's yours!
F	HANNAH	doorway to speak to Dad, could you just please stay in the other room and let me take care of her?
M	EVAN	You never know when she's going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody.
F	HANNAH	Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you're awful. You probably were flirting.
F	NORMA	No! I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention. He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young... at heart.
F	HANNAH	You promised to stay on the wagon.
F	NORMA	The sacrifices I've made because of that man. He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his-- his-his-his-his mediocrity!
F	HANNAH	Okay, stop being so dramatic.
F	NORMA	He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
F	HANNAH	Okay, okay.
F	NORMA	Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
F	HANNAH	Yeah, I know, Mom.
F	NORMA	But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
M	HANNAH (V.O.)	She was so beautiful at one time, and he was so dashing. Both of them just full of promise and hopes that never materialized.
M	HANNAH (V.O.)	And the fights and the constant infidelities to prove themselves... and blaming each other. It's s-sad. They loved the idea of having us kids, but raising us didn't interest them much. But it's impossible to hold it against them. They didn't know anything else.
F	NORMA	You know, of all of us in the family, you were the one blessed with the true gift.
F	HANNAH	Ohhh, my true gift is luck, Mom.
F	HANNAH	I just had a lot of luck... from my first show, you know? I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
F	NORMA	Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark. She knows it. She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
F	HANNAH	Now, Holly's not shy.
F	NORMA	No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
F	HANNAH	True.
F	NORMA	I'd have been a great dope addict.
M	EVAN	Remember this, Hannah?
M	DR. BROOKS	Mr. Sachs, I'm afraid the news is not good.
M	DR. BROOKS	If I can show you exactly where the tumor is, and why we feel that surgery would be of no use.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	It's over. I'm face-to-face with eternity.
M	DR. BROOKS	...grown quite large without being detected... Not later, but now. I'm so frightened I can't move, speak, or breathe.
M	DR. BROOKS	Well, you're just fine. There's absolutely nothing here at all. And your tests are all fine. I must admit, I was concerned, given your symptoms. What caused this hearing loss in one ear, I guess we'll never really know for sure. But whatever it was, it's certainly not anything serious at all. I'm very relieved.
F	GAIL	What do you mean you're quitting? Why? The news is good! You don't have canc--the thing.
F	MICKEY	Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
F	GAIL	Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.
F	MICKEY	Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show... the whole world, it's meaningless.
F	GAIL	Yeah... but you're not dying!
F	MICKEY	No, I'm not dying now, but, but you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right. And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay. I'm not going to go tomorrow. But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
F	GAIL	You're just realizing this now?
F	MICKEY	Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
F	MICKEY	...because it-it's a very horrible thing to... think about!
F	GAIL	Yeah. What?
F	MICKEY	Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
F	GAIL	Yes, please.
F	MICKEY	A week ago, I bought a rifle.
F	GAIL	No.
F	MICKEY	I went into a store, I bought a rifle. I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself. The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated. I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first. And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
F	GAIL	Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
F	MICKEY	Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you? That makes everything...
F	MICKEY	...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything. I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
F	GAIL	I know, I know, and your hamster.
F	MICKEY	Yes!
F	GAIL	Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
F	GAIL	Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No?
F	MICKEY	I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
M	ELLIOT	I thought you weren't coming.
F	LEE	I almost didn't.
M	ELLIOT	Lee... uh...
F	LEE	I didn't sleep all night.
M	ELLIOT	No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
F	LEE	What are we doing, meeting in a hotel room? It's terrible, isn't it?
M	ELLIOT	I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
F	LEE	I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone. I was so torn when you called.
M	ELLIOT	I've wanted to call you everyday since I first told you how I felt.
M	ELLIOT	I resisted so many times. Don't think badly of me.
M	ELLIOT	This is not an easy situation.
F	LEE	I know it isn't.
F	LEE	That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else.
M	ELLIOT	I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
F	LEE	I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, my God.
M	ELLIOT	You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
F	LEE	Oh, all the time.
F	LEE	I know she must be a really passionate person.
M	ELLIOT	Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
F	LEE	I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
M	FREDERICK	You're late.
F	LEE	Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
M	FREDERICK	You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips... and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
M	FREDERICK	slightly in Lee's The reason why they could never answer the question "How could it possibly happen?" is that it's the wrong question. Given what people are, the question is "Why doesn't it happen more often?" Of course it does, in subtler forms.
F	LEE	I have a little headache from this weather.
M	FREDERICK	It's been ages since I sat in front of the TV... just changing channels to find something.
M	FREDERICK	You see the whole culture... Nazis, deodorant salesman, wrestlers... beauty contests, the talk show... Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling? Hmm? But the worst are the fundamentalist preachers... third- rate con men, telling the poor suckers that watch them that they speak for Jesus... and to please send in money. Money, money, money! If Jesus came back, and saw what's going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up.
F	LEE	Oh, God, Frederick, could you please lighten up?! I'm really not in the mood to hear a review of contemporary society again.
M	FREDERICK	You know, you've been very nervous lately.
F	LEE	I can't take this anymore.
M	FREDERICK	I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
F	LEE	I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not.
M	FREDERICK	When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
F	LEE	Frederick, we're going to have to make some changes.
M	FREDERICK	Like what?
F	LEE	Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
M	FREDERICK	Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
F	LEE	Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I... I have to leave. I have to move out.
M	FREDERICK	Why?
F	LEE	Because I have to!
M	FREDERICK	What are you going to use for money?!
F	LEE	I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
M	FREDERICK	Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But... does it have to be now?
F	LEE	Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
M	FREDERICK	Oh... Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
F	LEE	No.
M	FREDERICK	Oh, yes, you have!
F	LEE	No.
M	FREDERICK	You've been with someone!
F	LEE	Stop accusing me!
M	FREDERICK	I'm too smart, Lee! You can't fool me! You're turning all red!
F	LEE	Leave me alone!
M	FREDERICK	Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!
F	LEE	I'm sorry.
M	FREDERICK	Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
F	LEE	I'm saying it now!
M	FREDERICK	So you met somebody else?
F	LEE	Yeah.
F	LEE	But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this!
M	FREDERICK	Who is it?
F	LEE	What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
M	FREDERICK	But who? Where did you meet him?
F	LEE	It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
M	FREDERICK	You are, you are my only connection to the world!
F	LEE	Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me. It's not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
M	FREDERICK	Jesus... Jesus!
F	LEE	Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
M	FREDERICK	Oh...
F	LEE	Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean... it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
M	FREDERICK	Please, don't patronize me!
M	FREDERICK	God! I should have married you years ago when you wanted to! I should have agreed.
F	LEE	Oh, God, don't you know it never would have worked?
M	FREDERICK	I told you, one day you would leave me... for a younger man. I--
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	What passion today with Lee. She's a volcano. It was a totally fulfilling experience... Just as I dreamed it would be. That's what it was. It was like living out a dream... a great dream. Now I feel very good and cozy being here next to Hannah. There's something very lovely and real about Hannah. aside and lying down on the bed next to Hannah, his hands She gives me a very deep feeling of being part of something. She's a wonderful woman... and I betrayed her. She came into my empty life and changed it... and I paid her back by banging her sister in a hotel room. God, I'm despicable. What a cruel and shallow thing to do. I have to call her now and tell her what we did was crazy. It can't ever happen again. I'm not that kind of man... and I value Hannah too much. I love my wife. Now I've betrayed her. Oh, God!
F	HANNAH	Where're you going?
M	ELLIOT	I've, uh... gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
F	HANNAH	It's so late.
M	ELLIOT	Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot.
M	ELLIOT	What if he answers? I'll hang up. I'll tell her we can't communicate until I terminate my marriage. It's immoral.
M	ELLIOT	Then, time will pass. I won't call, and she'll get the idea. I gotta stop this before I get in too deep. I'd rather hurt Lee a little, than destroy Hannah.
M	ELLIOT	It's one-thirty. She... she can't have a conversation with me... with him around. I'm getting hysterical. I'll call her first thing in the morning. I'll call her at six. Frederick goes jogging at six, yeah, she'll be alone. And I'll, I'll call her and nip it in the bud.
M	ELLIOT	I've got it! I've got it! I've got it! Hello? Mel!
F	LEE	I would have hung up if you hadn't answered and I promise I won't ever do this again, but I just had to tell you, I feel very close to you tonight. Very, very close. Good night.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds, and, and in the end, none of 'em knows anything more about the big questions of life than I do. Ss--I read Socrates. You know, n-n- n--, this guy used to kn-knock off little Greek boys. What the hell's he got to teach me? And, and Nietzsche with his, with his Theory of Eternal Recurrence. He said that the life we live, we're gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity. Great. That means I, uh, I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again. Tch. It's not worth it.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	And, and Freud, another great pessimist. Jeez, I was in analysis for years. Nothing happened. My poor analyst got so frustrated. The guy finally put in a salad bar.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Oh! Look at all these people jogging... trying to stave off the inevitable decay of the body. Boy it's so sad what people go through with their-their stationary bike and their exercise and their... ...Oh! Look at this one! Poor thing. My God, she has to tote all that fat around. Maybe the poets are right. Maybe love is the only answer.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Shh--Of course, I was in love with Hannah. That didn't work out too well. I even took her sister out. Remember that?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Remember years ago when Hannah and I got divorced and she fixed me up with her sister Holly?
M	THE 39 STEPS	"I want to be like you I said I'm going to fit into your group..."
M	THE 39 STEPS	"I don't wanna be different Said I'm gonna be just like you Because I'm gonna buy the records That they play on radio...
M	THE 39 STEPS	"I'm gonna dance at clubs Gonna do just what I'm told Because I'm bleedin' now And I'm bleedin' now I wanna slip, slip, slip, slip, slip Into the crowd I wanna slip, slip, slip, slip, slip Into the crowd..."
F	HOLLY	Oh, why are you making those faces?
F	MICKEY	I can't hear you. I can't hear anything. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear! I'm--
F	HOLLY	Listen, you are witnessing genius!
F	MICKEY	I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I can't hear anything.
F	HOLLY	Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy! The room's alive with positive vibrations!
F	MICKEY	Holly, I'm frightened! I'm--After they sing... they're gonna take hostages! Now let's--
F	MICKEY	Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't...
F	HOLLY	You want some?
M	THE 39 STEPS	"I want to dress like you Say, I'll buy all the clothes I want to fuck like you Yeah, I'm sure it shows Because I'm..."
F	MICKEY	I don't. No. No.
F	HOLLY	Come on, Mickey. Come on.
F	MICKEY	But, no, you've been doing that all night! You're gonna... you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril! Really, don't, please.
F	MICKEY	Can we, can we go?
F	HOLLY	No!
F	MICKEY	My--uh...
M	THE 39 STEPS	"...Gonna buy the records That they play on the radio..."
F	HOLLY	I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
F	MICKEY	Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
F	HOLLY	Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass.
F	MICKEY	I can't understand you. Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music. I don't know where you went, went wrong.
F	HOLLY	Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person.
F	MICKEY	Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
F	HOLLY	Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
F	MICKEY	Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
F	HOLLY	I'm not angry! You know, you, well, you don't believe in ESP, you don't like rock music, you won't get high... It's like I'm dating Cardinal Cooke!
M	BOBBY SHORT	"Why am I Just as reckless as a child? Why am I Like a racehorse running wild? Why am I In a state of ecstasy? The reason is 'cause something's Happened to me I'm in love again And the spring is comin'..."
M	BOBBY SHORT	"I'm in love again Hear my heart strings strummin' I'm in love again And the hymn they're hummin' Is those cuddle-up huddle-up blues I'm in love again And I can't rise above it..."
M	BOBBY SHORT	"I'm in love again And I love, love, love it."
F	HOLLY	Thanks for a swell time.
F	MICKEY	Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
F	HOLLY	I was so bored!
F	MICKEY	Yeah, that's tough! You don't deserve Cole Porter. You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
F	HOLLY	At least I'm open to new concepts!
F	MICKEY	And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time! What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in your purse?
F	HOLLY	This crowd wouldn't know the difference! They're embalmed!
F	MICKEY	Jesus... I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people. Really.
F	HOLLY	Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
F	MICKEY	Yeah. Me, too.
F	HOLLY	You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
F	MICKEY	Right. Yeah. I had a...
F	HOLLY	God!
F	MICKEY	...I had a great time tonight, really. It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
F	HOLLY	Oh, I'll see myself home!
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Yeah, it was quite an evening. Holly with her cocaine... She should have been wearing a gold shovel around her neck. Tch, she was polymorphously insensitive, I think. Too bad, too... 'cause, you know, I always had a little crush on her.
F	HANNAH	Oh, you just have to read the instructions. I mean, you just set one of these things and you can take, you can take pictures underwater.
M	CHILD 1	Can I try it?
F	HANNAH	Sure! Yeah. When we get to the country, we'll try it in the lake.
M	CHILD 1	Okay.
F	HANNAH	Okay?
M	CHILD 2	Can I go?
M	CHILD 1	Yeah.
F	HANNAH	Yeah! Okay.
F	HANNAH	Are you in a bad mood?
M	ELLIOT	I don't know. Um... I'm just antsy.
F	HANNAH	Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
M	ELLIOT	Was I?
F	HANNAH	Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
M	ELLIOT	Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
F	HANNAH	Why not?
M	ELLIOT	Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
F	HANNAH	Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
M	ELLIOT	I don't know.
F	HANNAH	Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
M	ELLIOT	But, you got four children!
F	HANNAH	I want one with you.
M	ELLIOT	Well... I-I think we should wait till things settle.
F	HANNAH	But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
M	ELLIOT	You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very... preconceived.
F	HANNAH	Yeah, but I... uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
M	ELLIOT	I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
M	ELLIOT	Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
F	HANNAH	Are you angry with me?
M	ELLIOT	No!
F	HANNAH	Do you feel, um... are you disenchanted with our marriage?
M	ELLIOT	I didn't say that.
F	HANNAH	Are you in love with someone else?
M	ELLIOT	My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.
F	HANNAH	Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me?
M	ELLIOT	What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.
F	HANNAH	Are you?
M	ELLIOT	No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
F	HANNAH	What, you, of c-- What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed!
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	For Chrissakes, stop torturing her. Tell her you want out and get it over with. You're in love with her sister. You didn't do it on purpose. Be honest. It's always the best way.
F	HANNAH	Look, can I help you? If you're suffering over something, will you share it with me?
M	ELLIOT	Hannah, you know how much I love you. I ought to have my head examined. I don't deserve you.
F	HOLLY	You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed. You know what I'm saying?
F	HANNAH	Oh, no, not at all.
F	HOLLY	Well, how about this?
F	HANNAH	Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.
F	HOLLY	Oh, yeah.
F	HOLLY	Did you ever think you'd be helping me buy something to wear to the opera?
F	HANNAH	Nuh-uh... but I think it's great. I can't wait to meet him.
F	HOLLY	He's married...
F	HANNAH	Oh-oh.
F	HOLLY	...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic.
F	HOLLY	Sometimes she's terrific...
F	HANNAH	Oooo.
F	HOLLY	...and then she just breaks down. And he has this sweet daughter... and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently. I mean...
F	HANNAH	Oh?
F	HOLLY	...he's really paid his dues, but... then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
F	HANNAH	You found all this, all this out on one date?
F	HOLLY	Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now... what should I wear to my audition?
F	HOLLY	I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it.
F	HANNAH	Singing?
F	HOLLY	Yeah, can you believe it?
F	HANNAH	Really?
F	HOLLY	Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh- what have I got to lose? Uh...
F	HANNAH	Well, no... I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
F	HOLLY	Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
F	HANNAH	No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
F	HOLLY	Well... you know, uh... I sing a little, I mean...
F	HANNAH	Ohh!
F	HOLLY	You know.
F	HANNAH	I know, no-- I know.
F	HOLLY	I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
F	HANNAH	No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that.
F	HOLLY	Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
F	HANNAH	Uh-huh.
F	HOLLY	Easily.
F	HOLLY	W-why? You don't think it's realistic?
F	HANNAH	No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take...
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
F	HANNAH	at some clothes hanging beneath the ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a... a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
F	HOLLY	Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
F	HANNAH	I hope.
F	HOLLY	Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
F	HANNAH	What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
F	HOLLY	Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
F	HANNAH	Okay! Okay. I-- What happened? You know, we were having a really nice time, a- and suddenly, everything went to bad feeling.
F	HOLLY	Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
F	HANNAH	Look, everything's going your way.
F	HOLLY	You're right. I'm happy. Why must I let my insecurities spoil everything?
F	HOLLY	"This year's fancies Are passing fancies..."
F	HOLLY	"But sighing sighs Holding hands This my heart Understands I'm old- fashioned And I don't mind it It's how I want to be As long as you agree To stay old-fashioned with me."
M	PRODUCER	Thank you.
M	DIRECTOR	Thank you.
M	PRODUCER	It was very nice.
M	ASSISTANT #1	Terrific.
M	STAGE MANAGER	April Knox?
F	APRIL	"Someday When I'm awfully low When the world is cold I will get a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look Tonight..."
F	HOLLY	I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
F	APRIL	Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive... or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
F	APRIL	Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
F	HOLLY	What?
F	APRIL	Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say.
F	HOLLY	You're joking.
F	APRIL	No, he called late last night.
F	HOLLY	I, uh, I'm very surprised.
F	APRIL	He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
F	HOLLY	And you, you-you're going?
F	APRIL	Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
F	HOLLY	But I'm seeing him.
F	APRIL	I know. I said that, but... he said it was something he really felt like doing.
F	HOLLY	Gee, um... I... I don't know what to say.
F	APRIL	Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
F	APRIL	Huh?
M	FATHER FLYNN	Now why do you think that you would like to convert to Catholicism?
F	MICKEY	Well, uh, because, y-you know, I gotta have something to believe in, otherwise life is just meaningless.
M	FATHER FLYNN	I understand. But why did you make the decision to choose the Catholic faith?
F	MICKEY	Tch. Well, y-you know... first of all, because it's a very beautiful religion. It's very well structured. Now I'm talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.
M	FATHER FLYNN	So at the moment you don't believe in God.
F	MICKEY	No. A-a-and I-I want to. You know, I'm-I'm willing to do anything. I'll, you know, I'll dye Easter eggs if it works. Flynn and sitting down in an adjacent I-I need some evidence. I gotta have some proof. Uh, you know, I- I- if I can't believe in God then I don't think life is worth living.
M	FATHER FLYNN	It means making a very big leap.
F	MICKEY	Yes, well, can-can you help me?
M	MOTHER	Why? Oh, my God!
F	MICKEY	I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy.
M	FATHER	How can we be happy?
F	MICKEY	Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.
M	FATHER	But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
F	MICKEY	Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b- but I need a dramatic change in my life.
M	FATHER	You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
F	MICKEY	I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
M	FATHER	But why? We raised you as a Jew.
F	MICKEY	So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
M	FATHER	But why Jesus Christ? Why, for instance, shouldn't you become a Buddhist?
F	MICKEY	A Bud--? That's totally alien to me. Look, you're getting on in years, right? Aren't you afraid of dying?
M	FATHER	Why should I be afraid?
F	MICKEY	Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
M	FATHER	So?
F	MICKEY	That thought doesn't terrify you?
M	FATHER	Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
F	MICKEY	I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
M	FATHER	Of what? I'll be unconscious.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
M	FATHER	How do you know?
F	MICKEY	Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
M	FATHER	Who knows what'll be?
M	FATHER	I'll either be unconscious or I won't. If not, I'll deal with it then. I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
F	MICKEY	Mom, come out!
M	MOTHER	Of course there's a God, you idiot! You don't believe in God?
F	MICKEY	But if there's a God, then wh-why is there so much evil in the world? What-- Just on a simplistic level. Why-why were there Nazis?
M	MOTHER	Tell him, Max.
M	FATHER	How the hell do I know why there were Nazis? I don't know how the can opener works.
F	LEE	Hi.
F	HANNAH	Hi. Where's Holly?
F	LEE	Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late.
F	HANNAH	Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
F	LEE	Oh, God, you know Holly. When she's depressed, she's manic. I think it was a good idea that we invited her to lunch.
F	HANNAH	I hope you tell her it was your idea...
F	LEE	Why?
F	HANNAH	...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
F	LEE	Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
F	HANNAH	So how are you?
F	LEE	Oh, me, I'm okay.
F	HANNAH	Do you miss Frederick?
F	LEE	No.
F	HANNAH	I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
F	LEE	How are you?
F	HANNAH	I'm okay.
F	LEE	You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot.
F	HANNAH	Y-yeah.
F	HANNAH	Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
F	LEE	Really?
F	HANNAH	Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just... kind of distant and difficult.
F	LEE	Oh...
F	HANNAH	I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
F	LEE	Like what?
F	HANNAH	I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
F	LEE	Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
F	HANNAH	Hey, hi!
F	HOLLY	Well, I just came from an audition...
F	LEE	Hi.
F	HOLLY	...which I did not get.
F	HANNAH	Awwww...
F	HOLLY	So what's new?
F	HANNAH	Boy--
F	HOLLY	They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
F	HANNAH	Oh, what do they know?
F	HOLLY	Thanks. But guess who was there auditioning?
F	LEE	April?
F	HANNAH	Oh, gosh.
F	HOLLY	You got it.
F	HOLLY	I was very polite. I maintained my poise. I said hello.
F	LEE	Hmm. I never trusted April, you know. She has eyes in the back of her head.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
F	LEE	Hmm.
F	HANNAH	Oh, God...
F	HOLLY	Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... you're gonna get impatient, but... I have to borrow some more money.
F	HANNAH	Well, that... th-that's fine.
F	HOLLY	But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection. Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore. It's just... crazy! I've got... an idea for a story. More than one. And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
F	HOLLY	I've picked up a lot about dramatic structure from doing my scenes in acting class.
F	HANNAH	Well, that-that's good. It just, uh... it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
F	HOLLY	Well-well, like what?
F	HANNAH	Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something... something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
F	HOLLY	Yeah, that's clerical.
F	HANNAH	No. She, didn't she say it was, um... she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things.
F	HOLLY	Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
F	HANNAH	I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer." I mean--
F	HOLLY	Yeah, you mean not at my age.
F	LEE	Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
F	HOLLY	Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat?
F	LEE	Boy... Holly... Holly.
F	HOLLY	I just want a salad. You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
F	HANNAH	What do--? You're being ridiculous.
F	LEE	You are, Holly. Stop it.
F	HOLLY	You treat me like a loser.
F	HANNAH	How?
F	HOLLY	You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.
F	HANNAH	Not so! No. I think I've been very supportive. I've... I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
F	HOLLY	Hmm!
F	HANNAH	I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would--
F	HOLLY	Uh, losers! All losers!
F	HANNAH	You're too demanding.
F	HOLLY	You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
F	HANNAH	You're crazy! That's not true.
F	HOLLY	Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
F	LEE	Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
F	HANNAH	Oh, now--
F	LEE	She's going through a really rough time right now.
F	HOLLY	Why are you so upset?
F	LEE	You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating.
F	HOLLY	What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
F	HANNAH	Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
F	HOLLY	What's the matter?
F	HANNAH	Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.
F	HOLLY	Good.
F	HANNAH	Take... take a year. Take six months. Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
F	HANNAH	What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay?
F	LEE	I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I... I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm... I have a headache.
F	HANNAH	Yeah?
F	LEE	I think we need to eat.
M	ELLIOT	I-I can't seem to take action. I'm- I'm like, uh, Hamlet unable to kill his uncle.
M	ELLIOT	I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah. And in no other area am I a procrastinator. Meanwhile... Lee has no direction. She's taking courses at Columbia... but just randomly.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	I try not to call her, but then she calls me and then... I call and... we try to resist meeting, but... once in a while we meet. Sometimes we argue because I can't break up my marriage. Sometimes we wind up making love and... we both feel terrible.
M	ELLIOT	But it's my fault.
M	ELLIOT	For all my education, accomplishments, and so-called wisdom... I can't fathom my own heart.
M	KRISHNA LEADER	What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
F	MICKEY	Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but... but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
M	KRISHNA LEADER	Yeah, well, what's your religion?
F	MICKEY	Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and... it didn't work for me. I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
M	KRISHNA LEADER	You're afraid of dying?
F	MICKEY	Well... yeah, naturally. Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
M	KRISHNA LEADER	Take our literature...
F	MICKEY	Uh-huh.
M	KRISHNA LEADER	...read it over, and think about it.
F	MICKEY	Well, okay. Thank you very much.
M	KRISHNA LEADER	You're welcome. Hare Krishna.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	Who are you kidding? You're gonna be a Krishna? You're gonna shave your head and put on robes and dance around at airports? You'll look like Jerry Lewis. Oh, God, I'm so depressed.
M	LEE (V.O.)	The nights are really getting cooler. Summer went so quickly. Soon it'll be fall. My literature professor really likes me. It was fun being out with him last night. Funny. I feel like I'm betraying Elliot... but that's ridiculous. Why shouldn't I see Doug? Elliot's not free. Just go one step at a time. Let's see what the next few months bring.
F	HOLLY	Hannah? Hi. Listen, um, you'll be happy to know that your money has not gone completely to waste... No, I have an actual first rough draft of something I wrote... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, I showed it to Lee, and she gave me some good pointers. And, um, listen, I'm pretty near where you live. I wonder if I could just drop it off... and, you know, when you have time, some time, read it, an-and we'll talk when I come over at Thanksgiving. Okay? All right. Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Listen. Listen. I think Lee met an interesting guy at Columbia... Yeah. Yeah, well, he sounds really nice... Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, we'll talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.
M	EVAN	Now, here... here's a song that Norma sang on that trip we made up to the show in Buffalo. And, oh, was she beautiful that night!
F	NORMA	Come on.
M	EVAN	Thank you, honey. Oh, yes, you were, dear. Don't you remember that night? back some sheet music that was starting to She was so beautiful... she was so beautiful that when men saw her walking along the streets, they'd drive their cars right up on the sidewalk.
M	EVAN	Isn't that right, honey, eh?
F	NORMA	A slight exaggeration.
M	EVAN	I know.
F	NORMA	But only slight.
M	ELLIOT	You've been very cold to me tonight.
F	LEE	No.
M	ELLIOT	Is something wrong?
F	LEE	Oh, not here. There are too many people around.
F	HOLLY	Hey, Hannah? You know, I think Lee is really serious about her new boyfriend. Yeah, eh, from what I understand he sounds really nice.
F	HOLLY	I'm so happy for her. I think she's in love.
F	HOLLY	Hey, what's the matter?
F	HANNAH	I'm real upset about what you wrote.
F	HOLLY	My script?
F	HANNAH	It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
F	HOLLY	Oh, so loosely.
F	HANNAH	No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
F	HOLLY	Well--
F	HANNAH	Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off?
F	HOLLY	Well, it's a made-up story.
F	HANNAH	No, it's real exact! The-the situations, the dialogue, everything. It's-it's full of intimate details between Elliot and me! Which I don't, I don't see how you could even possibly know about. A conversation we once had about adoption?
F	HOLLY	Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so obviously you discussed it with her. You... I just took the essence and I blew it up into drama.
F	HANNAH	I don't see how Lee could know about these things. I don't! I don't tell her everything.
F	HOLLY	Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
F	HANNAH	You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient?
F	HOLLY	Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful."
F	HANNAH	You're grateful, but you resent me.
F	HOLLY	Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.
F	HOLLY	Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
F	HANNAH	Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business... which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They're private!
F	HOLLY	Well, why don't you share them with us?
F	HANNAH	I don't... I don't want to bother everyone.
F	HOLLY	That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
F	HANNAH	I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
F	HOLLY	No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.
F	LEE	It's over, Elliot. I don't know how to make it any clearer. It's over. I can't see you anymore.
M	ELLIOT	Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this.
F	LEE	Look, I'm just as much at fault.
M	ELLIOT	If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
F	LEE	I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I... I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
M	ELLIOT	But it hasn't been forever.
F	LEE	It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which... I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
M	ELLIOT	Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
F	LEE	Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an- and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else.
F	LEE	Dinner soon?
F	MAVIS	About fifteen minutes.
F	LEE	Uh-huh. Good.
M	ELLIOT	And you're in love overnight?
F	LEE	I care a great deal about him, yes.
M	ELLIOT	Lee...
F	LEE	Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
F	NORMA	Sweetheart, I loved your script. I thought it was so clever.
F	HOLLY	Well, you're my mother. Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker.
F	NORMA	I particularly liked the character of the mother. Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.
F	NORMA	I'm so proud!
F	HOLLY	Oh, Mom, thanks.
M	UNCLE	Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right?
M	UNCLE	Are we supposed to have beer? Yeeeah!
M	UNCLE	Let me at it! How's that, Fletcher?
M	UNCLE	Doll? To Thanksgiving. Here's a little toast, doll. Come on. Bottoms up.
F	HANNAH	Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life?
M	ELLIOT	Me? Of course not.
F	HANNAH	There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so... personal they could only have come from you.
M	ELLIOT	Look, I've got a splitting headache and I don't like being accused.
F	HANNAH	I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do you... do you find me too... too giving? Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
M	ELLIOT	No.
F	HANNAH	Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you?
M	ELLIOT	cabinet and walking Hannah, my head is throbbing.
F	HANNAH	You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less.
M	ELLIOT	Hannah, I am very mixed up! Now please!
F	HANNAH	Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us.
M	ELLIOT	Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
F	HANNAH	Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?
M	ELLIOT	Leave me alone, can you?!
M	ELLIOT	Jesus, I've told you. I need someone I can matter to.
F	HANNAH	You matter to me. Completely.
M	ELLIOT	It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
F	HANNAH	But, look... I-I have enormous needs.
M	ELLIOT	Well, I can't see them, and neither can Lee or Holly!
F	HANNAH	It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost.
M	ELLIOT	You're not lost.
M	ELLIOT	I love you so much.
F	MICKEY	Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
F	HOLLY	I remember you.
F	MICKEY	Yes, you do recall, right?
F	HOLLY	I recall you.
F	MICKEY	I was walking past and I saw you in here...
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
F	MICKEY	...and I thought I'd come in and... and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
F	HOLLY	We didn't hit it off.
F	MICKEY	Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots.
F	HOLLY	How are you?
F	MICKEY	Good. How are you?
F	HOLLY	I'm fine.
F	MICKEY	You look wonderful.
F	HOLLY	Oh, no.
F	MICKEY	Yeah, really. You do. You do.
F	HOLLY	Yeah?
F	MICKEY	It was a terrible evening.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, it was.
F	MICKEY	Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
F	HOLLY	I'd never do that.
F	MICKEY	...in a really horrible way.
F	HOLLY	Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
F	MICKEY	You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
F	HOLLY	People change... you know.
F	MICKEY	Well, I hope you've changed.
F	HOLLY	Yeah, I hope you have, too.
F	MICKEY	I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
F	HOLLY	Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed.
F	MICKEY	...namely a personality.
F	MICKEY	So how are you?
F	HOLLY	I'm okay.
F	MICKEY	You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
F	HOLLY	Oh, nothing much. You know...
F	MICKEY	Well...
F	HOLLY	...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
F	MICKEY	Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
F	HOLLY	Probably not.
F	MICKEY	Are you, are you out of work or something?
F	HOLLY	No, well... I've been trying to write.
F	MICKEY	Have you?
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
F	MICKEY	Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
F	HOLLY	Oh... well, you-you're not interested in this.
F	MICKEY	No, you can tell me.
F	HOLLY	Come on.
F	MICKEY	No, I am. I am.
F	HOLLY	Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
F	MICKEY	Nobody ever said it.
F	HOLLY	Really?
F	MICKEY	This is it. Yeah. This is really--
F	HOLLY	Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something... that I wrote?
F	MICKEY	Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you. I don't know why it would.
F	HOLLY	No, the reason I ask is--
F	MICKEY	You've always hated my taste in the past.
F	HOLLY	No, I haven't.
F	MICKEY	You have.
F	HOLLY	I haven't. No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
F	MICKEY	I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
F	HOLLY	You're kidding me.
F	MICKEY	I've done no television whatsoever. No.
F	MICKEY	I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But... but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
F	HOLLY	Oh. Oh.
F	MICKEY	...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But--
F	HOLLY	You're okay, though, huh?
F	MICKEY	I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?
F	HOLLY	Oh, I'm fine.
F	MICKEY	What... what about your script? So what's it about?
F	HOLLY	Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
F	MICKEY	You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
F	HOLLY	But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script. Well, it's not my first script.
F	MICKEY	Hmm.
F	HOLLY	Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
F	MICKEY	Yeah.
F	HOLLY	...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
F	MICKEY	Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
F	HOLLY	Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know. I don't know.
F	MICKEY	Really?
F	HOLLY	So, uh... I threw it out, but I have this other one.
F	MICKEY	Well, you know, I-I-I... you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
F	HOLLY	Oh, gosh, I don't know. Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
F	MICKEY	Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
F	MICKEY	You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty... you know.
F	HOLLY	Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe.
F	MICKEY	Well, what about me?
F	HOLLY	Oh, well.
F	MICKEY	I should have kept going. I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
F	MICKEY	...and not begun this conversation.
F	HOLLY	the room towards her "We all go through life playing the hand we're dealt. Craig: And what hand were you dealt? "Emily: I'm two high pair, maybe even aces up. The problem is, you've got three deuces."
F	HOLLY	That's the end.
F	HOLLY	No, you can tell me straight. It's okay. Just, you know, tell me what you think.
F	MICKEY	It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless. I was... I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now. I don't know what to say. I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally... stunned. This is not an insult. I'm amazed that you can... It was-- I just thought it was great.
F	HOLLY	Really?
F	MICKEY	Yes! I was abso-- And... w- what... made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex-wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
F	HOLLY	Oh, it just came to me one day.
F	MICKEY	Well, it was just fabulous! I'm, I, you know...
F	HOLLY	Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
F	MICKEY	I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
F	HOLLY	Right.
F	MICKEY	...but who cares? It was just-- It was fabulous.
F	HOLLY	Oh!
F	MICKEY	Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so impressed.
F	HOLLY	Oh, God!
F	MICKEY	I am. You-you made my day.
F	HOLLY	Oh, wow!
F	MICKEY	It was just great. Uh, I was all set... I was set to be bored stiff.
F	HOLLY	Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh, uh...
F	MICKEY	I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
F	HOLLY	Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
F	MICKEY	Oh, who cares?
F	HOLLY	Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used to be so ambitious and... God, you really liked it?!
F	HOLLY	Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that? H-how did you get over it? I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. Well, you seem fine now.
F	MICKEY	Well... I'll tell you. One day about a month ago...
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...I really hit bottom. You know, I just felt that in a Godless universe, I didn't want to go on living. Now I happen to own this rifle...
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...which I loaded, believe it or not, and pressed it to my forehead. And I remember thinking, at the time, I'm gonna kill myself. Then I thought... what if I'm wrong? What if there is a God? I mean, after all, nobody really knows that.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	But then I thought, no. You know, maybe is not good enough. I want certainty or nothing. And I remember very clearly the clock was ticking, and I was sitting there frozen, with the gun to my head, debating whether to shoot.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	All of a sudden, the gun went off.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	I had been so tense, my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently...
M	NEIGHBOR #1	What's happening? Wh-wh-what's going on?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...but I was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me.
M	NEIGHBOR #2	I don't know. I heard a gun. Is everything all right?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	And suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding on the door, and-and I don't know, the whole scene was just pandemonium. And, uh, you know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	I-I-I-I didn't know what to say. You know, I was, I was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a mile a minute... ...and I-I jus knew one thing.
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	I... I-I-I-I had to get out of that house. I had to just get out in the fresh air and-and clear my head. And I remember very clearly. I walked the streets. I walked and I walked. I-I didn't know what was going through my mind. It all seemed so violent and un-unreal to me. And I wandered...
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...for a long time on the Upper West Side, you know, an-and it must have been hours! You know, my, my feet hurt. My head was, was pounding, and, and I had to sit down. I went into a movie house. I-I didn't know what was playing or anything. I just, I just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational perspective. And I went upstairs to the balcony, and I sat down and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that I'd seen many times in my life since I was a kid, an-and I always u-uh, loved it. And, you know, I'm, I'm watching these people up on the screen, and I started getting hooked o-on the film, you know?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...And I started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself? I mean, isn't it so stupid? I mean, l- look at all the people up there on the screen. You know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true?
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	What if there's no God, and you only go around once and that's it? Well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience? You know, what the hell, it-i-it's not all a drag. And I'm thinking to myself, geez, I should stop ruining my life...
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...searching for answers I'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts. And... you know...
M	MICKEY (V.O.)	...after, who knows? I mean, you know, maybe there is something. Nobody really knows. I know, I know "maybe" is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that's the best we have. And... then, I started to sit back, and I actually began to enjoy myself.
M	MARX BROTHERS & COMPANY	"Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me They'll be coming around the mountain..."
F	HOLLY	Um... look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and that's this.
F	MICKEY	Oh, yeah? What?
F	HOLLY	That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh... I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
F	MICKEY	Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous.
F	HOLLY	It's all right.
F	MICKEY	I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault. I--
F	MICKEY	So, so you want to go out to dinner again? I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
F	HOLLY	Sure. Sure, uh, yes.
F	MICKEY	Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
F	HOLLY	Yeah.
M	EVAN	I want ice! Who's got some-- Oh, there it is.
F	HANNAH	It's on the table, Dad.
M	EVAN	Hey, where's Holly? She's late.
F	LEE	Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote? It was great. She's really developed.
F	HANNAH	I know, she... she really writes good dialogue.
F	LEE	Yeah. I'll get some ice.
F	NORMA	Hannah, can I tell everybody you're going to play Desdemona?
F	HANNAH	Oh, Mom, it's only television. in a bowl on the
F	NORMA	Yes, but it's public television. And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get any greater than Othello. You with some big black stud! I love it!
F	HANNAH	Oh, Mom!
M	EVAN	Oh, honey!
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	Oh, Lee, you are something.
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	You look very beautiful. Marriage agrees with you. Everything that happened between us seems more and more hazy. I acted like such a fool. I don't know what came over me. That complete conviction that I couldn't live without you. What did I put us both through? And Hannah...
M	ELLIOT (V.O.)	...who as you once said, I love much more than I realized.
F	HOLLY	Hi! How are you! Happy Thanksgiving! Hi!
F	HOLLY	I didn't miss dinner, did I?
M	CHILDREN	No!
F	HOLLY	Huh? Hi, Marge.
M	FEMALE GUEST #1	You look lovely.
M	FEMALE GUEST #2	Hello, darling.
F	HOLLY	Happy Thanksgiving.
M	FEMALE GUEST #2	Good to see you. Same to you.
F	HOLLY	Hello.
F	HOLLY	It's beautiful.
F	MICKEY	Now don't get nervous. It's just your husband.
F	HOLLY	Hi.
F	MICKEY	Hi. How you doin'?
F	HOLLY	Okay.
F	MICKEY	When'd you get here?
F	HOLLY	Just a few minutes ago.
F	MICKEY	Oh. You look so beautiful.
F	HOLLY	Thanks.
F	MICKEY	You know, I was talking with your father before... and I was telling him that it's ironic. I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah... and I never thought that I could love anybody else. And here it is, years later and I'm married to you and completely in love with you. The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle. It really is. I... It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister... doesn't work out... many years later... He winds up... married to the other sister. It's, you know, it's a...
F	HOLLY	Tch.
F	MICKEY	I don't know how you're gonna top that.
F	HOLLY	Mickey?
F	MICKEY	Mmm, what?
F	HOLLY	I'm pregnant.
