M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ROOKIE COP	Cooool.
M	ARTHUR	Evening, Constable!
M	OLDER COP 1	Hi, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Are you familiar with the expression `I can explain everything'?
M	OLDER COP 1	Out of the car, please.
M	ARTHUR	Terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old Batchap getting in and out. This one has no doors, so I'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first. Which nobody wants... Apart from you, cheeky monkey! It's a joke! Okay, okay.
M	OLDER COP 1	Okay, explain everything.
M	ARTHUR	Well. What with having spunked 1.6 million fat Alberts on this little runaround, I thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne-er do wells? It worked for the billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not the future billionaire Arthur Bach- Templemead? Will I have to do traffic school?
M	OLDER COP 2	How much have you drunk, Arthur?
M	ARTHUR	To use the technical medical term - megabloodyshitloads. Either that or I've had a stroke! But fret not, I have a designated driver.
M	HOMELESS ROBIN	Where's my five thousand dollars?
M	ARTHUR	The Boy Homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize Manhattan.
M	HOMELESS ROBIN	It's LIZARDS! English prick!
M	ARTHUR	I trust this will cover all repairs to New York and any inconvenience to your good selves?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the other chap.
M	JAY	Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!
M	ARTHUR	Goodness. Why?
M	JAY	Said I cut the bombita with pig killer!
M	ARTHUR	Rude man. And who threw hot Americano in whose face again?
M	JAY	I did in his. No half and half neither. That shit burnt!
M	GARY	I burnt my sister's hair.
M	JAY	Cool...
M	GARY	Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause I don't fit her definition of hygiene. Plenty of places to take a shit, toilet's just one of them. Just ask the a-rabs.
M	ARTHUR	It's like a chat show, this. It's been said of my next guest, by Jay the bandaged lunatic, that she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out, whacked-up asswipe'. Carmella, when did you first dream of becoming a crack whore?
M	PROSTITUTE	Mother died when I was six.
M	ARTHUR	Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.
M	PROSTITUTE	My father raped me when I was twelve.
M	ARTHUR	Sounds like you had six relatively good years.
M	JAY	What do you do?
M	ARTHUR	I model riding boots, I spend money, I sleep with women. But I have weekends off and I am my own boss.
M	OLDER COP 1	Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G- d-lawyer's here.
M	ARTHUR	I never thought New York's underbelly could be quite such agreeable company. I shall never forget you. Farewell.
M	DEVERE	I don't think your mother will be pleased, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Really, Elverton - if a chap can't help out a few chums, whatever their station in life.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Each has given his or her word to put the criminal life behind them.
M	ARTHUR	I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep easy tonight.
M	JAY	Don't point that shit at me, bitch! I will FUCK YOU UP!
M	HOMELESS ROBIN	Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!
M	PRESS	Arthur! What will your mother say? Didn't she send you here to get you out of the British papers? Arthur!
M	ARTHUR	Anyone need a job? My last driver resigned after I filled his limo with squirrels. Preferably sober, clean driving licence?
M	ARTHUR (O.S.)	Anyone know a good bar?
M	ARTHUR	Stand back! Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the recession?
M	ARTHUR	The what?
M	ARTHUR	Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix this thing right now. How much, sir?
M	FIRST MAN	Um. $800 please.
M	ARTHUR	Coming right up. Fries with that? Congratulations everyone! THE RECESSION'S OVER!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can you squeeze me in for a little snack? Yeah, just me and a couple of mates. Arthur's flanked by Carmella the prostitute and Sofia from
M	ARTHUR	Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a motherlode of chips and your entire wine cellar please.
M	ERICA	Arthur?
M	ARTHUR	Erica? Fancy meeting you here! Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the very best friend forever of my girlfriend Susan. And Erica's parents Ernest and Margaret. Are you familiar with the expression `I can't explain anything'?
M	ERICA	Who are the women with you, Arthur?
M	ARTHUR	Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe she works for Avis. Checks the cars for dings, dead people in the trunk, that sort of thing. And this is Carmella. Anyway...
M	ERICA'S FATHER	What do you do, Carmella?
M	CARMELLA	Whatever you want. But no penetration without a rubber.
M	ARTHUR	Carmella's joking. She's actually a...queen. Of a very small country.
M	ERICA'S FATHER	Is she now?
M	ARTHUR	It's terribly small.
M	ERICA'S FATHER	I see.
M	ARTHUR	Rhode Island could beat the crap out of it in a war.
M	ERICA'S FATHER	Yes, it's a small place. 85 cents in a cab from one end of the country to the other. I'm talking small.
M	ERICA'S FATHER	I think I understand how small it is.
M	ARTHUR	Just had the entire country carpeted, this is not a big place.
M	ERICA'S FATHER	You need to grow up, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	That's easy for you to say, you haven't got 50 pairs of short trousers hanging in your closet. Maybe we should go somewhere else.
M	ERICA	Maybe you should.
M	ARTHUR	Could I have all those lobsters to go, please? We cut around the vast, opulent 20's apartment, scattered
M	GIRL (O.S.)	More British!
M	ARTHUR	Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot Rosy Lee right up your fanny?
M	ARTHUR	Hugh Grant Mr Bean self deprecation mad cow disease Yorkshire pudding bad teeth rain rain rain rain!
M	ARTHUR	Morning, Hobson!
F	HOBSON	Morning, Arthur.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus package failed to reignite the economy. De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?
M	ARTHUR	Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.
F	HOBSON	The African heritage festival celebrated five months from now?
M	ARTHUR	Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry. How impolite of me. Sofia, this is Hobson, my nanny.
M	SOFIA	Nanny?
F	HOBSON	He's merely shaped like an adult.
M	SOFIA	Is she going to stay here?
M	ARTHUR	Hobson, could you come back in a minute and a half please?
F	HOBSON	Negative. You're seeing your mother this morning.
M	ARTHUR	Nobody told me.
F	HOBSON	Actually I did, on the other side of the vast moat of champagne known as `last night'. I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear. Addictive personality. He was at mine until he was six.
M	ARTHUR	Hobson! Really...
F	HOBSON	I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the nipples to see him off...
M	SOFIA	I can't do this.
F	HOBSON	I support your decision 100%. Will you be requiring a taxi, or just be getting in a random passing car?
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	Say goodbye to your new friends, Arthur. They have to go back to the recession now.
M	ARTHUR	Cancel my mother please, Hobson. I'll work from bed today.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Not the death metal, please!
F	HOBSON	Aren't you a fan of Carcass?
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	`Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a classic of its genre.
M	ARTHUR	OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GET UP!
F	HOBSON	Good boy.
M	ARTHUR	I'm going for a shower.
F	HOBSON	I'll alert the media.
M	ARTHUR	To Bombay, a travelling circus came...
F	HOBSON	They brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name...Hobson!
M	ARTHUR	Female Tom Hanks!
M	ARTHUR (O.S.)	Heading east towards Park Avenue.
F	HOBSON	She's early today...
M	ARTHUR	Can we invite her up and dress her as Forrest Gump?
F	HOBSON	No.
M	ARTHUR	Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.
F	HOBSON	Do your armpits.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	Mr. Miller? My employer inexplicably agreed to purchase your... `Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care Bear'? For $11,000 plus shipping costs? Sorry, but that transaction will take place over my dead body, and I'm feeling rather well today.
M	ARTHUR (O.S.)	Hobson! That was your birthday present! You like bears!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Father Wolverine...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Wank Williams...That man has the constitution of an ox.
F	HOBSON	That reminds me, clean your genitals. Heaven knows what wildlife that girl was harbouring between her thighs.
M	ARTHUR	I give you `Sideways farting spider'.
F	HOBSON	Arthur, you have to stop giving money away!
M	ARTHUR	I'm a philanthropist.
F	HOBSON	With the emphasis on the `pissed'. Really, what is it about unearned wealth that brings out such idiocy in those who have it and those who want it? The way you're going, you'll have spent your inheritance before you've inherited it.
M	ARTHUR	`Eagle pointing at lesbian.'
F	HOBSON	Why did you fire Jessica?
M	ARTHUR	What kind of yoga teacher won't let a pupil invent positions? She was a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D. `Upwards Pooping Astronaut'.
F	HOBSON	Interesting. It looks more like `Rich twit hiding from mother.' May I remind you, she finances your preposterous existence...
M	ARTHUR	I know, I know. Never bite the hand that fists me.
M	MARTY	Sorry, fellas.
F	HOBSON	You don't seriously intend to keep employing this gentleman?
M	ARTHUR	Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He got laid off in Chicago...
F	HOBSON	But he doesn't know his way around New York!
M	ARTHUR	So? I want interesting, fun people around me, not drones who just get the job done...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Marty! Stop the car!
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	The Chrysler Building. Designed by William Van Allen...
F	NAOMI	...and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, this magnificent structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before the Empire State stole its thunder.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	The Chrysler got its name when the builder went bust in the 1928 Cement Famine and had to melt down his Chrysler to make the pointy bit at the top. If you peer closely you can still make out remnants of a hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk twice if you voted Hoover.' That was a joke, folks. It was built for the Chrysler corporation.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	The spire is a beauty, especially on a winter's morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to...
M	GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST	How tall is it?
F	NAOMI	1047 feet madam, not allowing for pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.
M	ARTHUR	Can I join your tour please?
F	NAOMI	Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the free authentic street pretzel. Sorry, my bosses make the prices.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Sorry. I can't take cards. Ah, owe me it. I start on that corner every day on the hour...
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't your braille windshield work?
M	CABBIE	!NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS!
F	NAOMI	PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED PINCHAZO GRANDE SU MADRE ES UN PUTA ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN MARTILLO!
M	ARTHUR	Wow. What did you say?
F	NAOMI	Just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals. Everyone make it over alive? Excellent. Next we enter Times Square, world famous for New Year's Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball descends at eye-poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools. Many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise. Sir? What shape is Times Square?
M	ARTHUR	A circle?
F	NAOMI	See? Morons.
M	GRUMPY MALE TOURIST	When do we get the pretzel?
F	NAOMI	Soon, sir. Soon.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Okay, next the very Laundromat once used by George Gershwin, Donald Trump...
F	NAOMI	...Mr Big from Sex and the City and three of the 9-11 terrorists.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Oh, dad.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the Chelsea Hotel half an hour after losing a sock in this very dryer.
M	ARTHUR	Are you abusing this tour to do your errands?
F	NAOMI	Are you abusing the tour to stalk me?
M	ARTHUR	Absolutely.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	These things are amazing. Have you ever put all your father's clothes on and just got inside one?
F	HOBSON	Where the blazes is that boy? Arthur!
F	NAOMI	Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's crown, the Empire State Building. This iconic symbol of American corporate might was adapted during World War 2 in case of attack from enemy forces. At three minutes' notice the entire structure can retract into the ground like a tortoise's head.
M	TOURIST	That's not possible. I should know, I'm a civil engineer.
F	NAOMI	You're not being very civil to me.
M	ARTHUR	The building doesn't retract; the ground rises up.
F	NAOMI	Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank you, sir.
M	ARTHUR	They were going to install giant legs so if a plane was flying at the tower it could run away. But where's it going to run?
F	NAOMI	Manhattan's in the way.
M	ARTHUR	It'd have to jump in the Hudson.
F	NAOMI	Victory to the Nazis. Is that what you want?
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits. Do I know you from somewhere?
M	ARTHUR	If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.
F	NAOMI	What are they?
M	ARTHUR	The gossip websites.
F	NAOMI	That the internet? Ah, my computer's too old for all that.
M	ARTHUR	For the internet? Seriously?
F	NAOMI	Life's too short for all this obsessive upgrading.
M	ARTHUR	You consider the internet an upgrade? Wow.
F	NAOMI	So why do people gossip about you?
M	ARTHUR	Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.
F	HOBSON	You're late for your mother!
F	NAOMI	Sorry, this pretzel stand is a watering hole for the crazies. The soup kitchen's just up and to the left, honey.
M	ARTHUR	Hobson, this is... Naomi.
F	NAOMI	She's with you?
F	HOBSON	Delighted to meet you, Naomi. Normally one has to go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature.
F	NAOMI	Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.
F	HOBSON	You aren't the first woman who walks the streets this young man has asked.
F	NAOMI	Who's this? Joan Rivers' older bitterer sister?
M	ARTHUR	My nanny.
F	NAOMI	Obviously. Seriously, who is she?
M	ARTHUR	My nanny. Well, she started as that, but these days she's more of an all-round enforcer and bodyguard.
F	NAOMI	Sorry, I have to get out the cattle prod and haul ass. Got another tour starting in eight minutes.
M	ARTHUR	Can I call you?
F	NAOMI	I don't give my number to grown men with nannies. But as you may not be a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.
M	ARTHUR	But what if this is the one?
F	HOBSON	This is just like the Komodo dragon. Everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there. You had to own one. Thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away.
M	ARTHUR	You said he's in London Zoo!
F	HOBSON	He is, Arthur. Are you the only one allowed to joke now?
M	ARTHUR	I don't like it here.
F	HOBSON	Of course you don't. People work here.
M	GRANT	Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead.
M	ARTHUR	Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your parents are you most like? Abercrombie or Fitch?
M	GRANT	I have no connection with that store. My family name is Von Krausehoff. Take a seat please.
M	GRANT (CONT'D)	Vivienne? White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.
F	HOBSON	Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take long. Then we'll have ice cream.
M	VIVIENNE (O.S.)	Come in, Arthur.
M	VIVIENNE (CONT'D)	Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Vivienne.
F	VIVIENNE	You know I prefer `mother'.
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry. You look more like a Vivienne.
F	VIVIENNE	So. How are you, Arthur?
M	ARTHUR	Quite busy. I have a riding boot shoot for Petrie Dressage...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	What else...I'm meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch to discuss the environment. She's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Crashed my Batmobile into the bronze bull on Wall Street...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	...which caused a hole to swallow up the New York Stock Exchange...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	..the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism. What else? Um...tripped over in the shower this morning. Head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there! Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so I bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I'm thinking of buying a giant. I think the market's right for it.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	You really are a shoddy mother.
F	VIVIENNE	Did I hear you say you were meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's nice. Right. Today we're going to have a friendly chat. Then a serious talk. And lastly make a timetable. How does all that sound?
M	ARTHUR	Amazing. Do you have any vodka?
F	VIVIENNE	What happened, Arthur? You were such a sweet baby.
M	ARTHUR	I still wake up in my own poo occasionally.
F	VIVIENNE	Right, that's it for the chat. Time to transition to our talk.
M	VIVIENNE (CONT'D)	This insanity has to end, Arthur. As the delightful coffee-coloured gentleman who runs this country said, `The time has come to set aside childish things.'
M	ARTHUR	Can't Hobson set them aside for me?
F	VIVIENNE	Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet are on the ground, she's of fine stock...
M	ARTHUR	Oh. That's what this is all about. I'm not marrying Susan. I don't love her.
F	VIVIENNE	And? You think I spent my marriage to your father skipping through meadows?
M	ARTHUR	Not after you ran him over in the Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's not funny.
F	VIVIENNE	Ditto your father. The aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur. It's about stability. Continuity...
M	ARTHUR	...and sinking your fangs into Susan's father's bank account.
F	VIVIENNE	The Johnson family's considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue. Burt is a pillar of the community.
M	ARTHUR	His baby formula was taken off the market in six African countries!
F	VIVIENNE	A completely innocent error in places where there's precious little for children to live for anyway. The families all got gift baskets as compensation. That little bump in the road aside, Burt is a devout Christian.
M	ARTHUR	Yes, because they're never insane. And where did he get Jesus?
F	VIVIENNE	Burt paid his debt to society years ago.
M	ARTHUR	He strangled a fireman! Who strangles a fireman?
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur...
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met someone else very lovely who, as far as I know, isn't related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood.
F	VIVIENNE	Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end of our line. We need an heir.
M	ARTHUR	I nearly gave you an heir!
F	VIVIENNE	Oh, give me strength! A Bach- Templemead having a child by a lap dancer called `Mystery'?
M	ARTHUR	That was just her stage name! To give her more mystery when she...waved her fanny around. Her real name was...what was it again?
F	VIVIENNE	Susan is 33 this year. Her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her. You risk having no sons, or worse, some pea-brained hunchback who hugs everyone!
M	ARTHUR	Great! I like hugs! And some of them are really good at math. You know the `Frog and Toad' books?
F	VIVIENNE	No.
M	ARTHUR	Of course you don't. Hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles. They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles I can squirt up a rich girl.
F	VIVIENNE	Your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense...
M	ARTHUR	That I won't follow in his footsteps and marry a woman I hate? I think he might climb out of the grave and dance on it.
F	VIVIENNE	Suit yourself.
M	VIVIENNE (CONT'D)	My will, which I have updated to designate Grant in reception as the sole beneficiary.
M	ARTHUR	You wouldn't! You're my...
F	VIVIENNE	...Vivienne? Try me.
M	VIVIENNE (CONT'D)	Shall we segue to the timetable part of our meeting?
F	HOBSON	Ah. The ring your father gave your mother, I recall.
M	ARTHUR	Did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his Bentley?
F	HOBSON	No. Your father was a gentleman.
M	ARTHUR	What's gentlemanly about dying before I knew him? That's just rude. Did he ever love my mother?
F	HOBSON	They had their days.
M	ARTHUR	Ah well. At least he doesn't have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	What about Naomi?
F	HOBSON	Arthur. I say this with love:
M	ARTHUR	Uh-oh...
F	HOBSON	Even by modern male standards you're a breathtakingly immature little shit. Coupled with the kind of money you have access to, that's deadly. Susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the Flatiron Building, but she's a solid girl who will look after you.
M	ARTHUR	I have you for that.
F	HOBSON	Not forever.
M	ARTHUR	Yes forever. You're Hobson.
F	NAOMI	Hello? Hello? This is your English stalker.
F	NAOMI	Oh, hi! What's up?
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry, I've never really understood that question. Are you free tomorrow night?
F	NAOMI	Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht.
M	ARTHUR	Is that a euphemism for something naughty?
F	NAOMI	No, it's a lie. I have a creative writing class. Tonight?
M	ARTHUR	I have a contractual commitment. Friday?
F	NAOMI	You got it.
M	ARTHUR	Paper.
F	NAOMI	Sorry?
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, I was talking to something else. So. What do you want to do?
F	NAOMI	A movie?
M	ARTHUR	Movie? Come on, you've got to try harder than that.
F	NAOMI	Pizza.
M	ARTHUR	What have you always wanted to do?
F	NAOMI	It's a first date, Arthur. Not our honeymoon.
M	ARTHUR	Every date will be our honeymoon. Ewww. Okay, uh, picnic in the park...or dinner with a view. I like views.
M	ARTHUR	What sort of food do you like?
F	NAOMI	Anything but guts and mushrooms. Okay, enough questions.
M	ARTHUR	Oh come on. This all helps build up a profile of you before I trick you into my basement. I'd hate to not have your favourite snacks ready.
F	NAOMI	Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done? Just that I....
F	HOBSON	Time to get engaged, Arthur. The Komodo dragon can wait.
M	ARTHUR	Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?
M	BUTLER	No, sir. It's 8.34.
M	ARTHUR	FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can be a real cunt sometimes, don't you think? I'll be right back. See you in an hour and a half ago...
M	BUTLER	Would you care for anything while you wait?
M	ARTHUR	A trampoline and a selection of woodland creatures if that's not too much trouble. Ah! Shhhhh...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Bollocks. Sorry. Actually, you couldn't, um....you know... ...turn this into a nice 1990 Romanee Conti, could you?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Cheers ears.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	`Genuine Sword of the First Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Jesus Fucking Christ! Sorry. It's not like you shouted `Arthur Fucking Bach' when they pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Feel the force, Luke.
M	BURT	Arthur!
M	ARTHUR	I, er, had a bit of food stuck in my teeth and couldn't find a toothpick.
M	BURT	Heck, this sword went through three crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems. Nothing you can do to harm it.
M	ARTHUR	You don't, um, have anything stronger, do you?
M	BURT	Sparkling.
M	BURT (CONT'D)	`The drunkard and the glutton shalt come to poverty: and drowsiness shalt clothe a man with rags.'
M	ARTHUR	Surely a glass of sherry at Christmas?
M	BURT	Peace be with you.
M	ARTHUR	And also with me.
M	BURT	Arthur. Can I be honest with you?
M	ARTHUR	You're the real Slim Shady? I knew it! My faith teaches me to hate the sin, not the sinner. But with you, I struggle with that belief.
M	ARTHUR	You could switch to Judaism. Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I put the fan on?
M	BURT	Anyway, Arthur. However I feel about you, my daughter loves you.
M	ARTHUR	Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Let's knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on the sex offenders register....No, I am and she knows. Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay! I did once dabble actually, so I can tell a plausible story.
M	BURT	You made love to a guy?
M	ARTHUR	One Moslem doesn't make a mosque, Burt.
M	BURT	You made love to a Moslem?
M	ARTHUR	No, sir, it was Prince Alois of Lichtenstein and he made love to me. The fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi full of Krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality.
M	BURT	`If there is a man who lies with a male, they shall surely be put to death.'
M	ARTHUR	Crikey. Couldn't there just be some kind of on-the-spot fine?
M	BURT	You will stop this talk and marry - my - fucking...
M	ARTHUR	Oh bollocks.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	It's a miracle! He is risen!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hi Susan. Erica.
F	SUSAN	Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I was talking to your mother. I hear you have something to ask me!
M	ARTHUR	Shall we go?
M	WAITER (O.S.)	...the chef has bathed the bass in a parceline of Chilean fennel and finished him with a little gift of kobe beef. Also I have a progressive tasting of Kumamoto oysters en gelee which evolve on the palate, from light and refreshing to complex and spicy. A short story with a twist at the end! Le fin.
M	ARTHUR	Do you have something with less words please? The chef doesn't have to re-cook it, just scrape off the nouns and trim out all that gibberish in the middle.
F	SUSAN	He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do the skate in wood ear mushroom.
M	WAITER	Excellent decision. Sir?
M	ARTHUR	A bowl of champagne and a spoon.
F	SUSAN	Arthur, did you really have to be so icky to Dominic?
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry. I just can't handle the whole specials act. It's not a Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some heated up dead things that aren't on the main menu.
F	SUSAN	You know, I was grumbling to your mother about how things are with us sometimes. How I'm sure you're trying to drive me away...
M	ARTHUR	Um hm.
F	SUSAN	But she was explaining that relationships are like property purchases; invest only in high-end stock, avoid anyone 'up-and- coming', then hold onto the property through thick and thin to deliver maximum return! Isn't that darling?
M	ARTHUR	Is it possible to buy the house but then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm not suggesting pimping you.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Look. You after our first child is born.
F	SUSAN	Arthur. Why can't you learn to laugh at genuinely amusing things?
M	ARTHUR	Such as?
F	SUSAN	YouTube clips of babies giggling. Dane Cook.
M	ARTHUR	Susan. Why are we together?
F	SUSAN	I love you, Arthur. And you love me, whatever you think.
M	ARTHUR	We don't have the same sense of humour. We don't like the same films, food, music. You like horses, I think they're arrogant idiots...
F	SUSAN	Don't they say opposites attract?
M	ARTHUR	That depends on the opposites. Racists and the Nation of Islam don't secretly want to 69 each other. Susan, you're beautiful. You're bright. You're fucking loaded. Is there really no one else who could make you happy?
F	SUSAN	No.
M	ARTHUR	Never?
F	SUSAN	Well, I had a thing at college. That was serious for a while. But daddy...
M	ARTHUR	Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it not to work out, then shot the bloke behind a meat truck? Because Jesus would consider that cheating.
F	SUSAN	Ask me, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Susan. You're the only woman...at this table.
F	SUSAN	You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody who drinks like you can be happy.
M	ARTHUR	How do you know? What if the drunker I get the better it is for me? Not everyone who drinks is a poet, Susan. Some of us drink because we're not poets.
F	SUSAN	A real woman could stop you from drinking.
M	ARTHUR	It'd have to be a real big woman.
F	SUSAN	Ask me, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR (O.S.)	All done.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Susan. Would you marry me? Take the weekend if you want...
F	SUSAN	Yes, I'll marry you.
M	WAITER	Ladies and gentleman - the happy couple!
F	SUSAN	Erica will be the planner.
M	ARTHUR	Erica? She hates me.
F	SUSAN	Who I love, she loves.
M	ARTHUR	Oh, come on. She always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an Uzi.
F	SUSAN	Hello...thanks, daddy! Sorry, hang on, I have Erica calling...
M	ARTHUR	What's going on? I only just bloody proposed!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	What have I done, Kitt? This mistake's up there with Hitler joining his school debating team...
M	VOICE (FEMALE)	Go to bed, Arthur.
F	HOBSON	And stop this self-pitying bibble. You're going to be fabulously rich.
M	ARTHUR	Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor. Some poor people I see look happy.
F	HOBSON	That's either because they're far away or you've just given them money. Arthur, poor people have to work. They stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs.
M	ARTHUR	Don't patronise me. I have a job.
F	HOBSON	Lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work I mean. And I don't want to see you suffer. Take your fish oil.
M	RALPH	When are we getting cable?
M	NAOMI (O.S.)	We have satellite.
M	RALPH	Honey, that's some bullshit aerial from the 99 cent Store!
F	NAOMI	It's a satellite dish!
M	RALPH	I read the box! It said `No satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals!' That's like saying `Hey - eat this plate of broken glass! It won't make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'
F	NAOMI	It's better than nothing.
M	RALPH	No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but you're even cheaper than your mom. And she bought food from yard sales.
F	NAOMI	I miss her too, daddy. But now she's gone and if I'm going to keep you in grits and Oprah the rest of your life, you live by my rules.
M	RALPH	But you live like you're preparing for a war. And you earn a decent salary.
F	NAOMI	So? I want to know I can look after you.
M	RALPH	What's he do, this English bum?
F	NAOMI	Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.
M	RALPH	Yeah and I bet that girl said the same about her date. Honey, stay home. I don't want you ending up like that poor girl.
F	NAOMI	A bad actress holding her breath?
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Stop watching CSI. Sorry we drove around so long. Navigation isn't my driver's strong point.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Or road awareness.
M	ARTHUR	Can you put this on please?
F	NAOMI	On a first date? Are you crazy?
M	ARTHUR	Trust me.
F	NAOMI	Arthur. We're in Battery Park at night. I've met you once - in the company of your nanny. You make a disturbing number of jokes about stalking and basements. My dad already has you down as a mass murderer. And you want me to put on a blindfold?
M	ARTHUR	I give you my word - if I kill and eat you, you'll never see me again.
F	NAOMI	Okay, I'm officially a little worried. Don't worry!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	You said you wanted a picnic.
F	NAOMI	Arthur, I don't know what to say. It's beautiful. Who did all this?
M	ARTHUR	The picnic fairies. Who liaised with the flower fairies, the candle fairies, the log fire fairies, the hidden sound system fairies...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	...and the pizza fairies.
F	NAOMI	Did you take account of the heroin fairies who hang here at night?
M	ARTHUR	It's nice to keep it simple like this. I'm sick of Michelin-star restaurants. All that embarrassing crap with the specials.
F	NAOMI	Are you kidding? Where I normally eat, the special's the one that comes with a free toy. You're rich rich, aren't you?
M	ARTHUR	I get by.
F	NAOMI	`It doesn't remotely matter how much or what you spend it on' rich?
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Craziest thing you ever bought?
M	ARTHUR	I once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed £100,000 to open a falafel stall.
F	NAOMI	Oh my G-d, you're serious.
M	ARTHUR	What's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party?
F	NAOMI	I once said the Manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for `You've got Mail', but that after the film wrapped, everyone moved to the set because there was less crime.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it. Gotta go, battery. Love you too. Mom died last year. For eight months dad ate nothing but Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI. So I persuaded him to move in with me. Where he eats Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI.
M	ARTHUR	Sounds like you're very good to him.
F	NAOMI	What are you gonna do? All those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the TV. And then one day, you're the one saying `No, honey, it's bad for you! Go to bed.' Weird, huh?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah. I hate that. Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you find that?
F	NAOMI	AT&T; store in 1998.
M	ARTHUR	It's...You've had it twelve years?
F	NAOMI	It's a fine phone. Battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	I can't believe these mofos who gotta keep up with the latest bullshit. CDs come along, so out with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in, out with the CDs. I just kept the vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be incredibly hip once every 20 years.... WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
M	ARTHUR	I couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view. So it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it ace?
F	NAOMI	No it is not ace, you crazy English bastard! This is dangerous!
M	ARTHUR	Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put these on.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Naomi, it's okay! It's very safe. It's this company called `Aerial Delights'. They specialise in catering unusual events at a height of 180 feet above the ground.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	So what got you into the walking tours?
F	NAOMI	You're seriously making date small talk while this is going on?
M	ARTHUR	Be still. Breathe deep. `When you can be calm in the midst of activity, this is the true state of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.
F	NAOMI	`Lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': Naomi Snart.
M	ARTHUR	Taste this truffle.
F	NAOMI	What the hell. Gotta go sometime, right? At least it won't be years of pain like mom. Just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth.
M	ARTHUR	So anyway. The tours...
F	NAOMI	Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still. The tours are a temporary nine year fill-in until I'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round.
M	ARTHUR	What did you write?
F	NAOMI	A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a childrens' publisher. Sunshine Press'. The rejection letter was the meanest thing I ever read.
M	ARTHUR	Kids can be so cruel...
F	NAOMI	Arthur? We have a problem.
M	ARTHUR	I told you, don't worry. These crane people know what they're doing!
F	NAOMI	Not that kind of problem.
M	JUNKIE	Phone. And the watch. Hurry.
M	ARTHUR	Um. Out of interest, how did you get up here?
M	JUNKIE	What you talkin' about, dog?
F	NAOMI	Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed by `Robbed in the sky'!
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	This isn't funny, you lunatic.
M	ARTHUR AND NAOMI	NOOOO!
M	ARTHUR	OWWW! You don't understand! We're 180 feet up in the sky!
M	JUNKIE	You on the same shit as me, yeah? Good stuff, right?
M	ARTHUR	No, we're not high! Well we are, but only in the literal sense.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hit the panic button! It's next to the truffle station!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hurry!
F	NAOMI	I can't find it. Over here?
M	ARTHUR	No! That's the bouquet of world hams!
M	ARTHUR	I had fun tonight.
F	NAOMI	I can't believe I'm saying this, but so did I.
M	ERICA	Summarising Phase Alpha: formal wear for bridal attendants, groom's attendants, mens' formal wear, St John the Divine all confirmed...
M	ARTHUR	Are there breathing holes in the coffin?
M	TAILOR	I'm sorry?
M	ARTHUR	In case I'm passed out drunk rather than medically dead?
M	ERICA	Don't worry, Thomas. This whole thing's just a joke to Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Thanks, Hobnobs. You are good to me.
F	VIVIENNE	Take this away. Progress on the reception?
M	ERICA	Black inked at the Emery Roth Room at the Ritz-Carlton. A first pass at the guest list. Bride's family and friends:
M	ERICA (CONT'D)	Groom's family and friends:
M	ERICA (CONT'D)	We can arrange to screen off the area behind your guests, Arthur. To make it seem less desperate.
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too colourful and this hangover's a 7.6 on the Richter..the Sickter...
M	ERICA	Cakes, caterers, floral arrangements, photographer...
F	HOBSON	Will there be anything else, sir?
M	ARTHUR	No, thanks.
F	HOBSON	Ma'am?
F	VIVIENNE	No. You can leave.
M	ARTHUR	Why all this crap now? What's the rush anyway?
M	BURT	The wedding is in a month, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	A month? I was thinking more sort of ten, fifteen years. Just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day.
M	ERICA	Where are you going?
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait.
M	ARTHUR	Here we are.
F	NAOMI	We're not going to end up in the Hudson again, are we?
M	ARTHUR	I can promise you won't get wet.
F	NAOMI	Are you okay?
M	ARTHUR	Yeah, fine. Actually...
F	NAOMI	Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go somewhere really romantic?
M	ARTHUR	Everything is 99 cents?
F	NAOMI	Yip. A whole penny less than those bourgeois assholes at the Dollar Store.
M	ARTHUR	`Warning: This product contains chromium, which may be linked to chronic bronchitis and reproductive hazards."
F	NAOMI	That one was on the news. Everyone else recalled them, the pussies. Not my 99 Cent!
M	ARTHUR	Maybe China's trying to wipe out the west's children one by one.
F	NAOMI	Oh, I love this place.
M	ARTHUR	Why?
F	NAOMI	Well, I'd like you to believe it's because I'm a poor girl reduced to buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in- a-can to Right Said Fred because I don't know where my next paycheck is coming from. But the truth is - bargains get me hot. Got it from ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?
M	ARTHUR	Yes please.
F	NAOMI	Looking west, the ladies' hygiene products. Note that the more natural-sounding the name, e.g. this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine Spray, the more lethal chemicals it contains. Watch out for the products cunningly labelled to make the dumber consumer think they're getting the real thing: 'Special J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup...
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	And ah, the music: Dated sounds for lonely people to buy cheap shit to.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	I once watched a woman shoplift an 8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her panty hose to 'Everything I do, I do it for you'.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Why are you staring at me?
M	ARTHUR	Just fascinated.
F	NAOMI	You're good at fascinated.
M	ARTHUR	You're good at fascinating.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Are you okay? Let me help you.
M	OLD WOMAN	Not that one.
M	ARTHUR	This one?
M	OLD WOMAN	No. There's less beans in it.
M	ARTHUR	This one?
M	OLD WOMAN	No.
M	ARTHUR	This one?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	No. I think I hear a mouse inside.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No rodents. Packed.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Quick, before someone gets it.
M	OLD WOMAN	You got a good one here, honey.
M	ARTHUR	Look. Us in a year's time.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	If you got ill, I'd care for you.
F	NAOMI	I'll get ill.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get out when they start playing Phil Collins. Want to see how to get a quarter from a shopping cart?
M	ERICA	Tiger Woods has confirmed!
M	ARTHUR	I didn't know you knew him.
F	SUSAN	I don't.
M	ARTHUR	Why is he coming?
F	SUSAN	He agreed to daddy's fee. This is going to be the happiest day of my life!
M	SUSAN (CONT'D)	Why is she here all the time?
M	ARTHUR	If you can bring Erica, I can bring Hobson.
F	SUSAN	She's my wedding planner.
M	ARTHUR	She's my Hobson.
F	HOBSON	Tell Naomi. That's an order.
M	ARTHUR	Reminiscent of a French castle perched 500 feet above New York, the penthouse was known from early days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.
F	NAOMI	A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta have a second ballroom.
M	ARTHUR	Where George Gershwin and the Astors danced to Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred Austere and Stingy Rogers.
F	NAOMI	I just need one of your collection of bathrooms.
M	ARTHUR	Behind the telephone box fish tank. See you on the balcony.
F	NAOMI	Hobson?
F	HOBSON	He's not like other men, you know.
F	NAOMI	I think I realised that as I plunged into the Hudson with a junkie. But I like him. He's fun.
F	HOBSON	I know he is. That's the problem.
F	NAOMI	What does that mean?
F	HOBSON	I'm sure Arthur will explain.
M	ARTHUR	Your kids' book. What was it about?
F	NAOMI	`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an asthmatic boy detective.
M	ARTHUR	Be serious.
F	NAOMI	Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose Heart Escaped'. It was about this kid who wakes up to find his heart has climbed out and is shinning down the drainpipe to freedom.
M	ARTHUR	I love it. Rainbow Press said it was too disturbing. But it wasn't literal - there wasn't a kid lying there with a gaping hole in his chest. It was just this cute little heart bouncing up and down shouting `You can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm paraphrasing.
M	ARTHUR	Did he catch the heart?
F	NAOMI	Never got that far. You like the hooch, don't you?
M	ARTHUR	Only if I'm sad, happy or bored. There's this bit in a book Hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all: `We must stop eating cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he ate another.'
F	NAOMI	Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and Toad!
M	ARTHUR	`Frog put the cookies in a box. `There' he said. Now we will not eat any more cookies.' `But we can open the box.' Frog tied some string around the box. `There' he said, `Now we will not eat any more cookies'. `But we can cut the string and open the box'.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	So Frog took the box outside. He shouted in a loud voice, `Hey birds, here are cookies!' Birds came from everywhere. They picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away. `
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Now we have no more cookies to eat' `Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going home now to bake a cake.' Classic addict.
F	NAOMI	That was beautiful. It's like you read it yesterday.
M	HOBSON (OOV)	Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea. They were two close friends sitting alone together.
M	ARTHUR	I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my toad.
F	HOBSON	You're quite sure about this?
M	ARTHUR	Yes.
F	HOBSON	Oh, bollocks.
M	RALPH	I don't know, honey. What's this teabag even doing here? Couldn't he make it in Lord of the Rings land?
F	NAOMI	Not that it matters, but he's a billionaire.
M	RALPH	You have my full permission to marry him.
M	GRANT	Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!
M	ARTHUR	I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning to ride you around the course next. Her last boyfriend broke his ankle jumping that ditch. Had to be destroyed on the spot.
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur. What's so urgent that you had to come all the way out here?
M	ARTHUR	I'm in love. With a woman who isn't exactly who you'd describe as Susan. She's called Naomi.
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur, we've been through this!
M	ARTHUR	Won't you at least meet her?
F	VIVIENNE	What family is she from?
M	ARTHUR	The Snarts of Detroit.
F	VIVIENNE	Never heard of them.
M	ARTHUR	No, because they're normal. She's a walking tour guide, her dad's a retired car worker.
F	VIVIENNE	Susan will generate quality sons, not oil-soaked car monkeys.
M	ARTHUR	Unbelievable! Why don't you just keep me here, pay a servant to wank me into a bottle once a day...
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur...
M	ARTHUR	...then inject it all into a field of heiresses and see who farts out a thoroughbred first?
F	VIVIENNE	We need an heir!
M	ARTHUR	Fine! You can have one with Stevey Steroids here! Surely even your uterus has had a face lift by now.
M	GRANT	That's enough, Arthur...
M	ARTHUR	None of your business, J Crew.
M	GRANT	You are so ungrateful to your mother. She adores you!
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur. Come back here.
M	ARTHUR	You can shove your inheritance up your horse's arse!
F	VIVIENNE	Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your heart. But do be aware I consider what you've squandered so far an advance on your inheritance. That's about $17 million.
M	ARTHUR	Why would you do that? You'd never get it back.
F	VIVIENNE	No. But you'd spend the rest of your life in court. There's a simple solution to all this. Marry Susan. And cheat with the nobody from Queens.
F	NAOMI	Have you been at the cookies?
M	ARTHUR	I ate the whole jar.
F	NAOMI	Oh, man. What? What?
M	ARTHUR	I'm engaged. To another Susan. Woman. Engaged to another woman.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
F	NAOMI	What are you talking about? This is bullshit. Who do you think you are? Is this some rich guy thing?
M	ARTHUR	I was going to tell you! I just...
F	NAOMI	Yeah, yeah, you just.
M	ARTHUR	Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it to get to this! I planned to just be your friend but then I started to fall for you and I thought `I can't marry Susan, I might fall for Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to marry Susan or I'll be poor so I won't fall for Naomi' But then I did fall for you! Because you're brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours. You're too smart, Snart. Smart Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal. Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne, and I said `I can't marry Susan, I love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I don't know any more.
F	NAOMI	You're frog.
M	ARTHUR	Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if you don't marry Susan, I'll make you pay all the inheritance money back even if you can't - ha ha ha'. Okay she didn't laugh but she might as well have, the evil cow. Because it's like all the money ever and they'll put not just me but both of us in prison and your dad, like in Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and Oliver and....
F	NAOMI	Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of your personality earlier we wouldn't be having this conversation.
M	ARTHUR	Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?
F	NAOMI	Why?
M	ARTHUR	'cause it'll reduce the proportion of my life I'll spend feeling utterly miserable.
F	NAOMI	Bye, Arthur. Bea Arthur? What's she got to do with all this?
F	NAOMI	It's going to be okay. I'll get you a beer, yeah?
M	RALPH	I just have to be alone for a minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear it...
F	NAOMI	Designed by William Van Allen and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, the Chrysler...
M	RUDE MALE TOURIST	Hey. I got a question.
F	NAOMI	Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants to come home with me and butt in with questions while I'm watching Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?' Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep, long day. What's your question?
M	RUDE MALE TOURIST	How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace?
M	FEMALE TOURIST	When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh...
M	MALE TOURIST 2	You're the only one who really knew me at all.
F	NAOMI	What is going on?
M	OLD FEMALE TOURIST	How can you just walk away from me, when all I can do is watch you leave?
M	TEENAGE BOY TOURIST	'cause we've shared the laughter and the pain...
M	NEWSSTAND GUY	And even shared the tears.
M	NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)	You're the only one who really knew me at all.
M	ARTHUR	So take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space. And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face...Just take a look at me now.
F	NAOMI	Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks. he's getting married. But I guess he didn't choreograph that bit for you.
M	ARTHUR	But..but this took ages to rehearse. I had the frog outfit specially made. These aren't actual tourists.
F	NAOMI	I gathered that, Arthur. Are you capable of doing anything without it being a grand gesture?
M	ARTHUR	What do you mean?
F	NAOMI	It's like Hobson said. You're not like other men. If you were normal, if the money and the booze didn't cloud everything, you'd deal with the fact that you're engaged, rather than just looking for ways to win me back. But it was a lovely routine, really. Fantastic outfit.
M	ARTHUR	I just wanted to see you.
F	NAOMI	You need to see someone, Arthur. Seriously.
M	ARTHUR	Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a haircut! Hobson?
M	MARTY	It says here you shouldn't forget to clean your junk. I guess that's what...'genitahlio-ah' is.
M	ARTHUR	Marty? What are you doing there?
M	MARTY	Hobson left me in charge. She's gone to bed. She had a headache.
M	ARTHUR	She's had quite a few headaches lately.
M	MARTY	She blacked out.
F	HOBSON	Put my bears back on, Arthur.
M	ARTHUR	Not until you answer my question.
F	HOBSON	I'm travelling down a white tunnel. To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why is it so hot? Who's the red gentleman with the big pitchfork?
M	ARTHUR	Will you cut it out?
F	HOBSON	Arthur. There are three books. This is important. Take them back to the library...
M	ARTHUR	Hobson, please. Don't die any more. It's getting very boring.
F	HOBSON	Arthur. Old women, like bears, get sore heads. Are you okay? You look a little lost.
M	ARTHUR	Naomi doesn't want to see me.
F	HOBSON	A terrible shame she had to go. A little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
M	ARTHUR	Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk about Naomi that way again. What gives you the right to be such a snob? You're just...you're just... Mary Poppins with a menopause!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hobson, I've never raised my voice to you. I'm sorry.
F	HOBSON	I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur, you may be growing up.
M	ARTHUR	Do you want anything?
F	HOBSON	I want to be younger.
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, it's your job to be older. Hobson. If you're feeling better tomorrow, will you accompany me somewhere? She pats his hand gently.
F	HOBSON	Of course, Arthur. How do I look?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I can't have this getting out. I'm in the public eye.
F	HOBSON	Yes, it would be disastrous to harm such a dignified profile.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	It's going to be okay, Arthur.
M	MEGAN	I was waking up four, five, six mornings a week in different mens' beds...
M	MEGAN (CONT'D)	I wanted to die. To be nobody.
M	JAMES	I steal from my friends, my family. I sold my son's pedal car so I could score junk...
M	ARTHUR	Jesus....
M	JAMES	I accidentally backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens...
F	HOBSON	Marty! This isn't a sports bar in Chicago. These people aren't here to brag.
M	JAMES	I had a business, a home and it's all gone! I'm in this fucking grave and they're pouring the earth in!
M	ARTHUR	Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know about anyone else, but this isn't exactly killing my thirst.
M	LEADER	Well why did you come...What's your name?
M	ARTHUR	Gandalf.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, you're not going to convince me my life isn't fun. And no offence but if I ran over my mother, I'd be out celebrating. Which is what I plan to do right now. Come on, Hobson. Marty.
M	WOMAN (O.S)	I'm Jane. And I believe I have a dependence on alcohol...
F	HOBSON	...and because I have done nothing with the astonishing opportunities handed to me, apart from pissing away my inheritance and drinking enough to kill a rhino.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	But imagine being me! I once ended up in bed with the daughters of I don't remember a thing about it, b) apparently I was sick on two of the women before c) losing control of my bladder on the third. All such fun...until the strangers I pay to be my friends have gone, the fog parts and there's a hole so big, you could pour all the champagne in the world into it and never fill it up. But I've got so much potential, a good heart, I'm a good person, even if I've completely wasted my short, precious life because I somehow convinced myself that happiness is a Komodo dragon, a case of booze and the memory of having once stripped naked to Beethoven for a coachload of German tourists who I met outside the Rainforest Cafe.
M	ARTHUR	It's always the quiet ones.
M	ARTHUR	Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go every time I crave a drink?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Susan? Look, I know the wedding date is set. But fancy bringing it forward? I just want to get it over with. In a good way. Think about it, yeah?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	It's the agony of possibility, Hobson. It just hurts too much to know I could still be with Naomi if I had the guts.
F	HOBSON	Just promise you'll never ask me to sleep with Susan for you.
F	NAOMI	Arthur, if that's... Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes. Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty hard on it..Love to...Love to...What time?
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	I'll call in dead to work. Bye.
F	HOBSON	Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi here?
M	RALPH	You must be the nanny.
F	HOBSON	I must be.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	Please stop this, I can't inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	If you and your undershirt would walk two paces back I could enter this dwelling.
F	NAOMI	Well, well.
M	RALPH	Ever since I met Arthur I liked him. We have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together...
F	HOBSON	Try not to talk. It's not your words but the breath which bears them. Perhaps you could repair to the East Wing and make me a cup of tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.
M	RALPH	Sure, sure.
F	HOBSON	Arthur is having a pre-wedding party tonight. You should come.
F	NAOMI	Oh, should I? Are all the other girls he passed up going too?
F	HOBSON	Don't you want to show Arthur how well you're doing?
F	NAOMI	Tell him thanks, but I have a deadline.
F	HOBSON	Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry. You could bring your father. A magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment.
F	NAOMI	Why would I go to this? Why would I do that to myself?
F	HOBSON	My dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love. And the food promises to be breathtakingly free.
F	NAOMI	Are you alright?
F	HOBSON	Better than you, dear.
F	NAOMI	You really look out for Arthur, don't you?
F	HOBSON	Yes. And it is a job that I recommend highly.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	You really look out for this gentleman, from what I've heard.
F	NAOMI	Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill pet shelter won't take him.
F	HOBSON	Thank you. Would you go the bathroom and commence washing? You only have three hours and it could be quite a project.
F	NAOMI	I appreciate what you're trying to do but I'm not going to that party.
F	HOBSON	Suit yourself.
F	NAOMI	Have you seen a doctor?
F	HOBSON	Yes. And he has seen me.
F	NAOMI	I think Arthur has a very good friend. May I kiss you on the cheek?
F	HOBSON	Is it something you feel strongly about?
F	NAOMI	Yes.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	Dad! Call 911.
M	VOCALIST	Thanks. We're going to move things up tempo now with `The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You.'
F	VIVIENNE	Splendid affair, Susan.
F	SUSAN	Don't thank me, thank Erica.
F	NAOMI	With all due respect, Hobson, you're talking out of your frumpy English ass. Arthur needs to know!
F	HOBSON	You are not to pull him out of that party on my behalf. Hello? Naomi!
M	RALPH	You're gonna get through this, babe. Then who knows what the future may hold?
M	DOOR MAN	Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?
F	NAOMI	Snart plus one.
M	PASSING WOMAN	Nice dress. Vera Wang?
F	NAOMI	Ross Dress For Less. You know where Arthur is?
M	PASSING WOMAN	Sorry.
M	BURT	When Arthur proposed to my daughter, I was overjoyous. The Bach-Templemeads are my kind of people: classy. Respectable. Well spoken. People like in Shakespeare in Love, who esprouse the same values I have always upheld both in my business and spiritual life. But tonight isn't about me or America's leading independent formula brand.
M	ARTHUR	Thank you, Burt! I've actually prepared a little surprise song with my friends here. The band starts playing `Close To You' by the Carpenters.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Why does cash suddenly appear, every time you are near?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Just like me, it longs to be, close to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the sky, all of which, I can buy... I'll sing a proper song. You say potayto and I say potahto, You say tomayto and I say tomahto, potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto, Let's call the whole thing off! You say AA, and I say `no way', you say `Red Bull' and I say `Go away, Rehab, No way, Red Bull...
F	JUSTIN	We meet again!
F	NAOMI	Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?
F	JUSTIN	The ballroom. I'll take you to him.
M	JUSTIN (CONT'D)	I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.
M	JUSTIN (CONT'D)	Isn't she beautiful?
F	NAOMI	Of course she is. Why would Arthur marry a pig?
F	JUSTIN	What business is your family in?
F	NAOMI	Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a fortune built on small pets.
F	JUSTIN	I'm sorry?
F	NAOMI	Hamsters, mice, doglets...
F	JUSTIN	Doglets?
F	NAOMI	Tiny dogs. The technology's not perfect. Seeing a horse the size of a can of soup fall dead before your eyes - that shit stays with you.
F	NAOMI	Are you sure he's this way?
F	JUSTIN	Absolutely.
F	NAOMI	Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?
M	WOMAN	That way. The ballroom.
F	NAOMI	Bye, Justin.
M	DOOR MAN	Excuse me, madam. You're not an authorized guest.
F	NAOMI	I know that. I'm here to give Arthur some very important news.
M	DOOR MAN	Of course you are. Shall we discuss this outside?
F	NAOMI	Get your hands off me!
M	ARTHUR	It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.
F	NAOMI	Arthur, can I talk to you?
M	MAN IN A WHITE COAT	We ran tests. It was just a dizzy spell. We'll be sending her home tonight.
M	ARTHUR	But what about the other blackouts?
F	HOBSON	Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that party.
M	HOBSON (O.S, OFF)	Especially now that Naomi is there.
M	ARTHUR	She's fine. They're sending her home. Do you want a drink?
F	NAOMI	No, thanks, Arthur. I should go.
M	ARTHUR	But you came all this way. There's ridiculously fancy food, there's...
F	NAOMI	Arthur. Please. Can you just call me a cab?
M	ARTHUR	You're a cab. Shit. Hobson usually...
F	NAOMI	Orders cabs to take the girls away?
M	ARTHUR	Thank you for coming all this way. I'm sorry for all the stupid presents and calls and gestures.
F	NAOMI	It's okay.
M	NAOMI (CONT'D)	She was a looker from the get-go.
M	ARTHUR	What were you like as a kid?
F	NAOMI	Nuts. I thought the moon followed me. I would walk and think the moon went any place that I did. I thought it meant something special would happen. So I've been waiting. What an ass.
M	ARTHUR	Dance?
F	NAOMI	Arthur. We've been through this. Call that cab please.
M	MANDY MILLER	To Bombay, a travelling circus came, they brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name...
F	NAOMI	What the bejeezus is this?
M	ARTHUR	Hobson used to sing it to me. One dark night, she slipped her iron chain. Off she ran to Hindustan and was never seen again. Nellie the Elephant packed her bags, And said goodbye to the circus, Off she went with a trumpety trump, Trump trump trump...
F	VIVIENNE	Is this the tour guide?
M	ARTHUR	She's a writer.
F	NAOMI	Is this the Vivienne?
F	VIVIENNE	Crowded field, writing.
M	ARTHUR	Maybe someone will see her potential.
F	VIVIENNE	We all know who's seen her potential.
F	NAOMI	Meaning?
F	VIVIENNE	Oh, of course, you don't know, do you?
M	ARTHUR	Vivienne, please. Don't...
F	NAOMI	What is going on here?
F	VIVIENNE	My son became fond of you. You're not the first. Or the last, I imagine. Anyway I was scanning his monthly expenses - which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls - and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called...what was it now? Rainbow Press.
F	NAOMI	You bought Rainbow press? So you could tell them to publish my book?
F	VIVIENNE	He knows people, dear. I'm sure you do too, though the people you know tend not to own books, let alone publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll see you back at the party? Susan's a little worried.
M	ARTHUR	NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I would ever see you again. I was just trying to give you some...
F	NAOMI	Confidence? Self esteem isn't a gift, Arthur! It isn't a fur coat or a thousand billion orchids or an apartment made from truffles or whatever else you rich freaks use to express love!
M	ARTHUR	I do express love! I love you!
F	NAOMI	Don't say that!
M	ARTHUR	You just told me to! And stop going on about me being rich! You think it's easy being trapped by money?
F	NAOMI	Hello, Amnesty? Come quick! Arthur's being held against his will in Guantamoney Bay!
M	ARTHUR	Abu Greed?
F	NAOMI	Stop riffing with me! How dare you do what you did. I didn't need your money to feel good about myself!
M	ARTHUR	No. Being cheap gives you that.
F	NAOMI	Huh?
M	ARTHUR	At least I'm prepared to have fun. To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at me with my antique food, aren't I cool?' And...and...your phone's RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator, I bet you can only get calls from 1994 on it! As long as I don't get any from a drunk, rich fuck up like you!
F	SUSAN	Hello? I heard shouting.
F	NAOMI	I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came to complain about the conditions.
M	ARTHUR	Naomi, please...
F	NAOMI	Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you thought putting half and half in the staff kitchen was an improvement. But some people prefer Coffee Mate! You were disrespectful. I quit!
F	SUSAN	Because you changed the creamer? Arthur, Marty called from the hospital.
M	ARTHUR	It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke to her doctor.
F	SUSAN	Apparently you didn't.
F	HOBSON	It's just a headache!
M	ARTHUR	Stop saying that! You bribed a hospital orderly to tell me you were okay!
F	HOBSON	Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors know?
M	ARTHUR	Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing costly, health-giving presents!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'.. `A compilation of the band's most stomach-churning music videos and deathly live performances...'
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Put this on, please.
F	HOBSON	I don't want to put it on.
M	ARTHUR	Put it on. Or I'll fire you. Okay, or I won't fire you.
F	HOBSON	How much did you waste on this poppycock? I see you've decided not to grow up after all.
M	MARTY	She sounds like Darth Invader!
F	HOBSON	Why, Arthur?
M	VOICEOVER (O.S.)	Stargazer, known for her distinctive white mottled back...
M	VOICEOVER (CONT'D)	...is determined to catch the salmon, despite the treacherous rapids...
M	DOCTOR	Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a moment?
M	ARTHUR	Home? That's great news. Isn't it?
M	ARTHUR	How did this get here?
F	HOBSON	I have no idea.
M	ARTHUR	You might have a brain tumour but you're not a complete veggie burger just yet. Has Naomi been here?
F	HOBSON	She dropped by once or twice. Frightful needy trollop.
M	ARTHUR	I thought she gave up writing.
F	HOBSON	Just trying to spare her outright humiliation while I'm still here.
M	ARTHUR	Don't wear yourself out. You're not going anywhere soon.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	World's most advanced heart rate monitor. The tiniest problem will alert your own private platoon of paramedics camped out downstairs...
F	HOBSON	Arthur. I've loved caring for you so much. But you'll never grow up with me around. So either I retire. Or I die. Option 1 involves too much paperwork and blather with having to find somewhere else to live. And no offence to you, dear boy...
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	...but I think we've exhausted the bear-based entertainment. Which leaves option 2.
M	HOBSON (CONT'D)	You're a good son, Arthur. You can do anything with your life that you want. Just like I did. But you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat.
F	HOBSON	Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my use-by date.
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this one. I need you to care for me. Now take your fish oil.
M	ARTHUR	Hobson?
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	HOBSON! Why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off? GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT...
M	ARTHUR	Would Frog ever get up again? Or would he just sit in his tank, crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didn't even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hobson! Why are you in there when I need you? HOBSON!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Arrrrgghhh!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Sorry.
M	MARTY	How's the tea?
M	ARTHUR	Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.
M	MARTY	Want to talk about the Cubs game?
M	ARTHUR	Nahhh. Can I be alone please?
M	ARTHUR	Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get this, because your voicemail probably consists of a 4000 year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of her incontinence loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson died and I've fallen apart...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Marty! Can you get that? Marty! Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur! You haven't answered the phone for eight days. Susan's beside herself. What's going on? What do you think's going on? Hobson died.
F	VIVIENNE	Oh, that.
M	VIVIENNE (CONT'D)	Chop chop! You cleany penthouseio! Come on, Arthur. Have to pick yourself up, lad. It's like when Nixon my Great Dane had to be put down. Frightful state for days. But I pulled myself together.
M	ARTHUR	You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?
F	VIVIENNE	Well, yes. A faithful, humble companion who...
M	ARTHUR	Um, I think I'd like you to leave, if that's okay. Now?
F	VIVIENNE	Remember who pays for this apartment, Arthur. For everything!
M	VIVIENNE (CONT'D)	You had damn well better be at that wedding, boy.
M	ARTHUR	Don't worry. If I'm going to drink myself to death I'll need resources. Bye Vivienne...
F	VIVIENNE	It's mother!
M	ARTHUR	My mother's dead.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hello? I'm sorry?
M	AHERNE	The last will and testament of Jane Hobson. `I leave my life savings to the Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare County, California.'
M	ARTHUR	That'll explain the strong smell of bear shit. Sorry.
M	AHERNE	To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave this.
M	AHERNE (CONT'D)	To operate kettle, press red button. Milk in refrigerator; that's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door. Arthur. You're going to be okay. Now it's your turn to look after someone. All my deepest, fondest love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling down at you - or more likely, up at you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx.
M	BURT	I just want you to know, if he doesn't show up for this wedding, I can't know what I'll do.
F	VIVIENNE	Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned himself up. He's stopped drinking, he's anxious to get a real job. He's become a responsible citizen.
F	NAOMI	Due to a tragic error in the architect's drawing, the original Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886 was just seven inches tall. 100,000 New Yorkers rioted, having come expecting to see something more impressive than a garden gnome holding up an ice cream...
M	ARTHUR	Naomi!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	You're on a bus? With a microphone?
F	NAOMI	Girl's gotta have a dream.
M	ARTHUR	Naomi. Can you take the next 60 years off?
F	NAOMI	Are you okay? You're a mess. You look like you...now.
M	ARTHUR	Sorry. I accidentally swallowed three bottles of hand sanitizer. Fascinating story...Okay. Drinking was the only way I could get the courage to come here and say this: I don't need the money. I love the money. But I don't lie awake all night wondering how I'll live without ever seeing it again. I just wonder what it's like to go 24 hours without a steak tartare.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	The American Express Centurion card - you have to spend at least $250,000 a year to keep it, which I blow in a quiet week.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Sotheby's `World Elite' Mastercard for art collectors.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	And King of all idiotic reckless- SPEND-THE-FUCK-OUT-OF-EVERYTHING- FOR-TOMORROW-WE-DIE PLASTIC insanity: the Visa Black Card.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	PIN 3487. Daily ATM limit $180,000.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	The world's only platinum iPhone. With police radio app.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Alexander Amosu. Vicuna wool, shorn once every three years from the South American camelid - $50,000. Westmancott trousers, ten months to design, fit and make. $21,000.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Who wants the watch Neil Armstrong wore to step on the sun!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	These are from The Gap.
F	NAOMI	I'm so sorry about Hobson.
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.
F	NAOMI	It's okay. So how did Susan take it that you're not marrying her?
M	ARTHUR	She didn't.
F	NAOMI	You haven't told her?
M	ARTHUR	What's it to you? She's your arch- enemy.
F	NAOMI	Are you six? She isn't my enemy. She's the woman you proposed to!
M	ARTHUR	I couldn't tell her! Today's the biggest day of her life!
F	NAOMI	The wedding's today? When? 12. Which is... Where's my watch gone?
F	NAOMI	It's eight minutes to.
M	ARTHUR	It's too late, then.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I don't know her number! It's in my phone's address book in that gloop.
F	NAOMI	Church?
M	ARTHUR	St. John the Divine. Can we please just get me some clothes...
F	NAOMI	St John..Fourth largest church in the world...111th and Amsterdam. It's about four miles. Better hurry.
M	ARTHUR	You want me to go there? Like this?
F	NAOMI	What's the alternative? Jilt Susan at the altar? Can I expect the same treatment when you dump me?
M	ARTHUR	No! I love you!
F	NAOMI	C'mon, folks...
M	ARTHUR	Naomi! Susan's dad will...
F	NAOMI	Arthur. Prove you're not the same pampered little boy who can have what he wants then toss it aside when he's bored. Then we'll talk.
M	ARTHUR	Naomi! I don't even know the way!
F	NAOMI	5th...right on Broadway...left at Times...Right on 7th...back on Broadway....right on Amsterdam. The church is the big stone pointy thing full of rich people.
M	ARTHUR	SHIT! TAXI!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Um, can anyone spare... How much to St. John the Divine please?
M	DRIVER	About 15 bucks...
M	ARTHUR	Can anyone spare $15 please?
M	DRIVER	What about tip? You cheapskate?
M	ARTHUR	
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Stop! STOP!
M	ARTHUR	Gather round for the nearly naked Yoga man - YOGI BARE! I give you...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	`Chicken forgetting birthday'... TAXI!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	How far can I go with $1.95 and a Japanese coin with a hole in it?
M	DRIVER	A block and a half.
M	ARTHUR	GO!
M	ARTHUR	Excuse me, are there trains down there, like in films?
M	PASSERBY	Yes.
M	ARTHUR	Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother you, but...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Crikey. Thanks.
F	NAOMI	...originally a rough neighbourhood. Some say it was called 42nd Street because it wasn't safe to spend more than forty seconds on it.
M	MALE TOURIST	Excuse me.
F	NAOMI	If you burst into song, you're off this bus.
M	MALE TOURIST	Huh? I want to see St. John the Divine.
F	NAOMI	Sorry, sir, that's not on our route today. Anyway...
M	FEMALE TOURIST	I want to know if Arthur's gonna make it. You should be there for him.
M	MALE TOURIST	It says here `ask about your personalised tours'. I want the personalised tour. To St. John the Divine!
M	ALL OTHER TOURISTS	So do I! St. John the Divine, St. John the Divine, St. John the...
F	NAOMI	Okay!
M	ARTHUR	Ah! I'm trying to get to...
M	MANAGER	Hey!
M	POLICEMAN	Uh, unit 6J, we have reports of an indecent exposure on a school bus.
M	ARTHUR	I'm not him. Look ma! No holes.
M	ARTHUR (O.S.)	Susan?
F	SUSAN	Arthur? What's going on?
M	ARTHUR	Susan. I can't...I can't...
F	SUSAN	What?
M	ARTHUR	The girl at the party? The one who talked all that rubbish about Coffee Mate? I love her.
F	SUSAN	Shut up! We're getting married!
M	ARTHUR	But I don't love you!
F	SUSAN	And you think I love you?
M	ARTHUR	Well, yes. What's not to...
F	SUSAN	I never have.
M	ARTHUR	Susan, you're upset, you hate me. It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to go, or your dad's going to do whatever he did to your boyfriend from college.
F	SUSAN	Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her parents to send her away..
M	ARTHUR	HER? You're..a...
F	SUSAN	Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed that daddy is homophobic. He swore he'd disown me if it happened again.
M	ARTHUR	But...why do you want to marry...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Hang on. Am I your beard?
F	SUSAN	Why else do you think I'd spend more than 30 seconds in your company? You're the perfect cover.
M	ARTHUR	Have you been pretending to like Dane Cook as well?
F	SUSAN	No.
M	ARTHUR	Wow. Wow. Well. Uh... Thanks for your honesty. I don't feel so bad about calling this off.
F	SUSAN	Arthur, please. You can drink as much as you like, sneak off to Naomi. We keep the money. We live our lives. Everyone wins.
M	ARTHUR	I may be a weak, pathetic drunk. But I won't marry a lesbian Dane Cook fan.
M	ARTHUR	Good evening, St. John the Divine! Anyone in from St. Patrick's? Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan Mosque? AA?
M	ARTHUR	...and the first turned to the second horse and said `That dog just spoke'. The joke being that it's inconsistent that the horses can speak but the dog can't.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	The wedding's off. The bride has had second thoughts. I can't say I blame her. Would you marry me? You won't be seeing me again, as I'm going to be poor. I'll be shopping at the 99 Cent Store. Six pork chops for under a dollar!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Great. I'm glad we had this talk. I'll let you get on with the wedding....
F	SUSAN	Daddy, no! Stop it!
F	VIVIENNE	Burt! Get off my son!
F	SUSAN	DADDY!!!
M	BURT	You wouldn't hurt me.
F	SUSAN	Wouldn't I? You crushed me.
M	BURT	I just wanted you to be happy.
F	SUSAN	Bullshit. You wanted to stop me being a lesbian!
M	BURT	Shut up! Shut up you dirty little dyke harlot!
M	ERICA	You want some more, bitch? Huh?
F	SUSAN	Erica, that's enough, honey.
M	ARTHUR	Why didn't you tell me? We could have worked something out.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I'm joking.
M	ARTHUR	OW! Stop it! Why are you doing that?
F	NAOMI	Because I hate an infection! Keep still.
M	ARTHUR	No, you keep still.
F	NAOMI	What are we going to do, Arthur?
M	ARTHUR	I'll get a job. I'll model cheap riding boots for people with no horses. You can write books about boys whose lungs have run away.
F	VIVIENNE	Stop this! A Bach-Templemead has never been poor and we're not about to try that experiment with you, Arthur. That said, you've shown strength of character for once, instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship. The inheritance is yours. All I ask is, with Hobson gone, you finally start treating me like a mother.
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.
F	VIVIENNE	I beg your pardon?
M	ARTHUR	You've never earned that title. I wouldn't fake it with Susan. I won't with you.
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur. I will withdraw this offer forever. Don't doubt me, boy.
M	ARTHUR	I don't.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Take care, Viv.
F	VIVIENNE	Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If you walk out of that door...
M	ARTHUR	Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any more. Fancy joining us for a bowl of Special J? OW!
M	ARTHUR (O.S.)	This is outrageous!
M	ARTHUR	Operational heat controls in a shower are a basic human right! Owww! My eyes! I'm blind!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	What the hell's in this shampoo? Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea tree oil...
M	RALPH	Package for you. With any luck an apartment for you and Lurch.
M	ARTHUR	I thought you liked me.
M	RALPH	I may have been seduced by money. It happens.
M	ARTHUR	`Can I be your friend at least? Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is yours. It always was.'
M	RALPH	On balance, I'd go for it.
M	MARTY	Money good.
F	NAOMI	You were never happy rich, honey. It's only been a month. Be strong. Remember: however hard life gets, love will always find a way. What? Can't a girl make a joke?
M	ARTHUR	Brought her for moral support. But I'll do the talking this time.
M	FADE OUT
