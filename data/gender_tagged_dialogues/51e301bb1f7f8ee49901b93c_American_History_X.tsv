M	RASMUSSEN	years ago a local kid named Vinyard gets sent up for a couple of Crips who were to jack his car. Bob taught back in high school and has the case closely.
M	YOUNG COP	was a skinhead, right?
M	SWEENEY	was more like...the skinhead. and Cameron Alexander. mug shot. He flips it over and reveals MUG SHOT. Front and side view.
