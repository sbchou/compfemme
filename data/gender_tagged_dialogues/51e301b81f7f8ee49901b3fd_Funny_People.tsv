M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	GEORGE	Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm coming in.
M	COLLEGE STUDENT	Hey George, can I get a picture with you?
F	GEORGE	Sure buddy. Let's do it. One of the college students put his arm around George while
M	COLLEGE STUDENT #2	Can I get one?
F	GEORGE	Yeah bud. They take the picture.
M	COLLEGE STUDENT	You're the man. We love all your movies, even the last one.
F	GEORGE	Thanks. Tell your friends.
F	GEORGE	I like those lunestas. They really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover I get from the restorils. I try not to take them too often. Just when I know I have to get up early.
M	DOCTOR STEVENS	George there are some irregularities in your blood work... George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The
M	ANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV	We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation MUSIC UP - "MY SHIT's FUCKED UP" BY WARREN ZEVON
M	GIRL	Oh my God. Can you take a picture with me?
F	GEORGE	Yeah, sure. She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in
M	GIRL	Thanks. You are the funniest.
F	GEORGE	Thanks, pal. George drives home. We hear the voice of his doctor in his
M	DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)	It's a rare blood disorder. In the family of Hodgkins disease. We really don't have a treatment for it. There are things we can try. They're all very experimental in nature.
M	GEORGE (V.0.)	I don't understand what this means.
M	DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)	I think you need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Is there someone who can help you get your affairs in order? Ira is in the middle of a very long conversation with a
M	WOMAN	Is the turkey organic?
M	IRA	Yes, ma'am.
M	WOMAN	Well what does organic mean?
M	IRA	It means there's no additives or preservatives and it's hormone free.
M	WOMAN	Are there additives or preservatives in the food they feed the turkey?
M	IRA	I don't know ma'am.
M	WOMAN	I heard that because turkeys are fatty birds, mercury gets stuck in their fat. My daughter-in-law, she ate turkey and then she had a miscarriage.
M	IRA	I haven't heard about that. But I may not be informed enough to comment.
M	WOMAN	Well, you're not a doctor, so you shouldn't comment.
M	IRA	You are correct, I am not a doctor.
M	IRA	You should come see me do stand-up tonight at the Comedy and Magic Club.
F	CHUCK	I can't go through that again, man, that was painful.
M	IRA	That was five months ago. I've gotten a lot better.
F	CHUCK	They pay you yet?
M	IRA	Nah, not there. I just hang out and hope somebody doesn't show.
F	CHUCK	Wow, is there anyway for you to.be lower in show business? I don't know if you could even say you're in show business. Why don't you just fucking settle down and enjoy this gig? This is a sweet situation. The money's good, you've got health insurance.
M	IRA	Dude, I know you like it here but if I have to work here another year I would kill myself.
F	CHUCK	Really? In that case, when we bury you does it have to be in some kind of Jew cemetery? Next to Al Jolson or some shit?
M	IRA	Just come. I need the support.
F	CHUCK	No way. I'm funnier than you. And I'm not even that funny. I would go if I was paying to see me.
M	IRA	I'll pay your cover charge.
F	CHUCK	Okay, well you better be good, because I'm bringing a date.
M	IRA	Laughter's the ultimate lubricant. ON-SCREEN -- home video of George at college. George is ANOTHER IMAGE - We see a very young George performing stand- Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't
M	IRA	I was thinking about doing something about how I'm not good looking and I'm not bad looking. I'm just good looking enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top. If that was the case.
M	LEO	Yeah, something about how the uglier you are, the better the personality you need. And the hotter you are, the stupider you can be.
M	IRA	I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world.
M	LEO	Maybe something like... you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world. And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world. The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people.
M	IRA	That could work.
M	LEO	Let me keep that one, because I thought of most of it.
M	IRA	That's not cool. I came up with the concept! What do you got? Let's work on what you have.
M	LEO	I've got nothing in the notebook. I got drunk last night. But I need material, because I just got spots at the Improv. Budd saw me and approved me. I'm in.
M	IRA	How could they make you a regular? I got turned down twice.
M	LEO	Sorry, man. They're only going to let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so I think you're fucked. Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them.
M	MARK	Hey, dudes. You see this check that I got from my TV show for 25,000 an episode? There was another one of these on the kitchen counter. Did you see it?
M	IRA	No we didn't see it. Just don't leave those things laying around.
M	MARK	I wouldn't leave it around if they didn't give me so many. They give it to me every episode.
M	LEO	Don't throw it in our face that you're on a shitty show.
M	MARK	I wouldn't, if it was a shitty show and not what Time magazine called "insightful and delightful."
M	IRA	I thought you were moving out.
M	MARK	I decided I like it here. Living with you guys keeps me grounded. I don't want to be the guy living in the house on the hill. Even though I could afford it. Hey, I saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs. I invited her in. She's here.
M	IRA	She's in our apartment? I've never even talked to her. I just gave her quarters at the washing machine.
M	MARK	You were right, she is pretty mousy and sexy. You gotta talk to her.
M	IRA	I need time. I have a three-month plan.
M	MARK	I'll give you ten days for your three-month plan, then I am going to fuck her. You can't just leave that laying around. Starting right now.
M	MARK	The thing about working on a sitcom is it's 22 weeks a year, so I can do stand-up the rest of the year.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	But now people want to see me because they see me on a TV show, so I am kind of a draw. Have you seen the show?
F	DAISY	I don't own a TV.
M	MARK	Well I think you can download it to an iPod. Ira walks in.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Hey Ira, this is Daisy.
F	DAISY	how's it going?
M	IRA	Nice to meet you. I think I gave you quarters once. Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	Don't worry, I'll just lick it off the counter. Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.
M	EMCEE	Schneider didn't show up so, you can do ten minutes after Leo.
M	MAGICIAN	Don't go long because I have to load pigeons into my suit. I have to let them out or they'll die. I'm not fucking around. So when you get the light, don't go long. You've got one minute. ANGLE ON Leo on stage, doing a few more jokes. A MANAGER
M	MANAGER	Hey man. George Simmons just got here, he wants to go up. You're bumped. We'll put you on after George.
M	IRA	Well how long is he going to do?
M	MANAGER	I don't know. Last night he did five minutes. Last week he did an hour. fie'il do what he wants to do.
M	IRA	Well what about the magician? He just loaded his pigeons. He said I have to get off in ten minutes.
M	MANAGER	I'll have him unload the pigeons. Just be ready. Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage.
M	LEO	That was good, right? Some of the new stuff worked.
M	IRA	I just got bumped by George Simmons.
M	LEO	Are you serious? Shit - I've got a spot at the Improv, I cant hang out, damn.
M	EMCEE	A lot of times you hear about going to a comedy club and someone exciting shows up. I won't lie to you, that usually never happens. But tonight it is happening.
M	EMCEE (CONT'D)	Ladies and gentleman, you know him from [movie credits to go here] George Simmons? George walks on stage. The place goes crazy. He does some As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and
F	GEORGE	Ah life. What does it mean? sometimes life makes perfect sense. And then you `come'.
M	IRA	He's killing the crowd. Jesus, I can't follow this shit. After completely losing the crowd, and some minor
F	GEORGE	Life isn't all about laughs. Crazy shit happens. You've got to be nice to each other. You never know what's going to happen. Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Sorry I sucked it up out there. At least they are well rested for you. Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he
M	IRA	I'm not good looking. I'm not bad looking. I'm just in the middle. And if I had a personality that was Jut good enough, it would put me over the edge. The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb,
M	IRA	Sorry, man. I didn't mean to disturb you. I just can't open my door. There's no room.
F	GEORGE	Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out. George pulls the car back ten feet.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Hey man, you had some funny shit tonight.
M	IRA	Thanks!
F	GEORGE	Man, that audience hated you. They really did not like you. They liked your buddy, who looked exactly like you but was funnier. Man, that's going to haunt you. You're going to wake up in six months and think about this night.
M	IRA	Well, I'll probably bomb worse tomorrow and forget about this one.
F	GEORGE	I'm just fucking with you. You had some funny jokes in there. Good writing.
M	IRA	Well, obviously, I'm a... you know...I grew up on your shit, man. George just stares at him.
F	GEORGE	Alright, pal. Don't worry. Only two hundred people saw that tonight. I'll see you later. George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill you! Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is
M	IRA	Holy shit, you got seven hundred thousand hits in four days.
M	LEO	They put it on the main page at YouTube and it exploded. Which would be awesome if someone would pay me. The phone rings.
M	IRA	Hello?
M	GEORGE (V.0.)	Hey, is this Ira?
M	IRA	Yeah. Who is this?
F	GEORGE	It's George.
M	IRA	Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going?
F	GEORGE	I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes.
M	IRA	Definitely. What kind of jokes? Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to
F	GEORGE	I don't know, about computers and shit. I could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little.
M	IRA	No problem. Where do you want me to send em?
F	GEORGE	What is your email? I will send you my fax and email and all that.
M	IRA	It's a...irasexiraÃÂ®gmail.com.
F	GEORGE	I almost just changed my mind. You got to change that.
M	IRA	Ok.
F	GEORGE	Today. Seriously. Ok. Later. Ira hangs up and turns to his friends.
M	IRA	That was George Simmons. He wants me to write jokes for him.
M	LEO	Holy shit. That is awesome. You are so lucky.
M	MARK	Are you gonna get to meet him?
M	IRA	I don't know, but he is gonna send me his email address.
M	LEO	We are gonna have his email address? I have to send him the link to my short.
M	IRA	Easy. Let me get in there a little more. "Always erase your web history. I had a girlfriend hit history and see eleven hundred porn sites that I visited in Jonah sticks his head in.
M	LEO	I got one, but you have to tell him its mine. The best thing about Leopard is it lets you watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. And you guys made that possible. We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is Ira hesitates, then hits send. The phone rings. He answers it, groggy.
F	GEORGE	There's some funny shit in here. Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit.
M	IRA	Thanks man. I just want to give you a lot of choices.
F	GEORGE	Too many choices. I don't like reading that much. I need like ten good jokes. I'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten. But thanks for doing it.
M	IRA	Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice. I spent the whole night pretending I was you.
F	GEORGE	So you cried yourself to sleep? So you whacked off three times last night? Don't worry, I'll get you some money. Is five hundred good?
M	IRA	Yeah! That'll work.
F	GEORGE	I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig. You want to come check it out, see if your shit works?
M	LEO	Can we go outside and meet him?
M	IRA	No you can't. Because then we look like fans.
M	MARK	Maybe he's seen my show.
M	IRA	He doesn't watch your show. You're show is for eight-year-olds. It's a family show, he doesn't watch that shit.
M	LEO	I'll just go outside and pretend I'-,n washing my car. The Limo pulls up outside.
M	LEO (CONT'D)	Holy shit. I feel like my little girl is going to the prom.
F	GEORGE	How you doing, you ready for this?
M	IRA	Yeah, this'll be fun.
F	GEORGE	I think I'm going to have you go on before me to warn them up.
M	IRA	You don't have to do that. What if I bomb?
F	GEORGE	Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be more excited to see me. They'll be so glad your not on stage any more. Then if you do well, they'll be ready for me. Either way, you're helpful. The limo pulls up to a private jet. Ira is shocked. As they're having a conversation, Ira seems really freaked
F	GEORGE	I like this joke about watching porn and making porn all at the same time. That was a good one.
M	IRA	Oh good. Yeah, I thought you'd like that one. I was really happy with that one.
F	GEORGE	You want something to eat? I had them bring Chinese on the plane. Ira's eyes widen. He likes this way of life. ON STAGE - Sting is finishing up a set. This is a huge
M	DAVE	Okay, what do you want them to say when he introduces you? Do you have any credits he should mention?
M	IRA	Uh...credits? I don't really have any credits. Maybe you could just say I've been working on Apples for so long, my first one weighed more than I did. Nobody laughs.
F	GEORGE	And just say he's a friend of mine, and I think he's funny. Ira's walking off stage.
F	GEORGE	What the fuck is that? You did three of the jokes that you wrote for me.
M	IRA	I panicked. They just wanted jokes about computers.
F	GEORGE	That's why I hired you, to write jokes about computers. Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.
M	IRA	But there's a lot more. The first three on this page. You didn't think they would work, but I think they will. You should just try them.
F	GEORGE	They better kill, I'm getting paid a hundred thousand dollars for this.
M	IRA	Are you serious? ANGLE ON DAVE on stage.
M	DAVE	Ladies and gentleman, George Simmons. George does a few Apple jokes that do kill, and then he
F	GEORGE	We'll be on the ground in a half hour. Want to go to a bar? Do something fun?
M	IRA	Sure. I like fun.
F	GEORGE	Here's a grand for the jokes and the gig. Even though you should be paying me after that. Ira's eyes widen.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Good job.
M	IRA	That's the most money I've ever made doing anything in comedy.
F	GEORGE	Then this is an exciting moment.
M	IRA	Well, I didn't make a hundred grand like you.
F	GEORGE	I feel nothing. I remember when a grand was the most exciting thing in the world. I'd go to Red Lobster and go nuts. Now it's just numbers in a bank account. Enjoy tonight. You made a thousand bucks. -- George and Ira talk to two women, MANDY and DAWN. They -- George focuses on Mandy, flirting and preparing her to go -- The other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable Ira.
F	GEORGE	Hey, let's all go back to my house.
F	MANDY	Great! Yeah, that sounds like a... nice idea.
F	MANDY	This house is so big. It's bigger than the college I went to.
F	GEORGE	Oh there's a whole other wing that you wouldn't even know existed unless you went through this door.
F	MANDY	I want to see, I want to see. George and Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone.
M	IRA	You are very pretty.
F	DAWN	I have a boyfriend. Nothing is going to happen.
M	IRA	I didn't say anything was going to happen. I just said you were pretty. How do you even know I wanted something to happen?
F	DAWN	I hope she doesn't take a long time.
F	MANDY	I can't believe I'm having sex with Davey!
F	GEORGE	He can't believe he's having sex with you.
F	GEORGE	Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she left.
F	DAWN	Really?
F	GEORGE	Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house.
F	DAWN	Oh, well then I guess I better get going?
F	GEORGE	You don't have to go. I'm just saying that she left. I think she left her purse in the other wing. Come with me, let's go get it. Ira watches this, astonished.
M	GEORGE (CONT' D )	Did Ira tell you I have a room with all the classic pinball machines and video games?
F	DAWN	That sounds awesome.
F	GEORGE	Yeah, I got Galaga. Let's go check it out. George looks over his shoulder at Ira, as if to say, "A man's
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Hey don't go, I'll be back in a second.
F	GEORGE	That girl left. You want to talk to me while I try to go to sleep. Ira doesn't know what to make of this.
M	IRA	I guess so.
M	IRA	Did you have sex with both of those girls?
F	GEORGE	I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done. I figured you wouldn't mind.
M	IRA	That is crazy. That is super crazy.
F	GEORGE	It was great. It was crazy great.
M	IRA	How can that even happen? I guess I understand the first one, but why would the second one do it? You probably stink of the first girl.
F	GEORGE	Well, we took a steam shower together.
M	IRA	What?
F	GEORGE	she had never seen a steam shower before, I told her she should enjoy it.
M	IRA	She wouldn't fool around with me because she said she had a boyfriend.
F	GEORGE	She told me that too, but she says I was on her and her boyfriend's list of people she was allowed to screw. You'd be surprised how many women have me on that list.
M	IRA	I should get going.
F	GEORGE	Just talk to me before I fall asleep. I'm weird. I don't like being alone. You should crash in one of the rooms. You're too drunk to drive home. I won't try to fuck you, I just fucked two women and I'm kind of done.
M	IRA	I may have to whack it in your guest room.
F	GEORGE	Whack away, I don't give a shit. Hey, you were funny tonight. I could see how you could get good.
M	IRA	Thanks. That was fun. It was rare that I get to play to more than twenty-five people. I've never played for a thousand.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	it, s kind of easier, because even if two hundred like me, it sounds like a lot.
F	GEORGE	I do feel bad for you, because no matter how hard you try, you'll never be as funny as me.
M	IRA	Why would you say that?
F	GEORGE	Did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid?
M	IRA	No.
F	GEORGE	That's why. My dad always seemed annoyed with me. He'd always crack me on the head. You would not see it coming. I spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But he was an awesome guy. He was the coolest. He just got annoyed with me. Do you like your parents? They can't be that bad, because you're not that funny.
M	IRA	They're bananas. And always broke. They got divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last week. They hate each other. They always put me in the middle of it. I always wanted them to say, "We don't want you to suffer through this, so we're just going to handle it ourselves." They never would do it. They would always make me feel their pain all the time. I would never do that for my kids. Because it's like they._`.re kids. And no matter how many times I tell them to leave me out of it, they never do. Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	I'll let you crash.
F	GEORGE	No, keep going. It's interesting. Tell me about your day job?
M	IRA	Alright. So... I work at a supermarket at the deli counter. I hate it, but the money's actually pretty good. Better than you'd think. But I'd rather do comedy full-time if I could. The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin
F	GEORGE	Hey man, you want to make me breakfast?
M	IRA	okay.
F	GEORGE	Do you know how to cook anything?
M	IRA	Eggs.
F	GEORGE	Okay, let's have some eggs. While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills.
M	IRA	What are you doing, man? Are those vitamins?
F	GEORGE	No. Medicine. I'm sick.
M	IRA	What do you got?
F	GEORGE	I've got some crazy blood disease. They think I'm going to die in six months to a year. Some weird thing, almost nobody has it. All these are experimental.
M	IRA	Are you fucking with me? That's not funny, man.
F	GEORGE	No, I'm telling you the truth.
M	IRA	I never heard that before. That would be a big deal.
F	GEORGE	I haven't told anybody yet. I don't think I'm going to.
M	IRA	You're not going to tell anybody? You told me.
F	GEORGE	Well it's easier with you because I don't know you. I don't feel weird around you. I don't want to be treated like a guy who's going to die.
M	IRA	I don't know, man. I don't think you want to go through this alone. I think you've got to tell people. Your family. Your friends.
F	GEORGE	Actually, the reason why I only told you is I need you to do me a favor.
M	IRA	What? Anything, man.
F	GEORGE	I can't imagine suffering through the final stages of this. So...I was going to ask you if you would be willing...to euthanize me.
M	IRA	What does that mean?
F	GEORGE	Kill me. I figured if I found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and I wouldn't have to suffer. I got a gun that is untraceable. And a silencer. And I thought maybe tonight, I would take a bunch of sleeping pills, and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head.
M	IRA	I can't do that!
F	GEORGE	I'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash. You'd be doing me a favor. It would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody.
M	IRA	Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at least take a little time to think about it?
F	GEORGE	Holy shit, you would do it. You were literally thinking about doing it!
M	IRA	You're an asshole.
F	GEORGE	I'm an asshole, you were about to kill me. For fifty grand! That's not even a lot of money.
M	IPA	I just got nervous so I was delaying saying no.
F	GEORGE	You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer. While you're cooking me eggs.
M	IRA	That's not cool, man. You told me you're going to die and you want me to euthanize you. I almost had a heart attack.
F	GEORGE	Well, I actually am sick. And I'm not going to survive.
M	IRA	Don't do this. My friends do this all the time. They trick me, and then they trick me again. I'm very gullible. Don't do it.
F	GEORGE	I'm not putting you on, man. Just don't tell anyone. I mean that. I don't want people to know about this. I don't want to feel weird. Ira nods okay.
M	IRA	Are you religious? Does that give you any comfort?
F	GEORGE	Do you really think I'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you?
M	IRA	No.
F	GEORGE	Maybe later, Father Mulcahy.
M	MARK	That's so sad.
M	LEO	If it was me, I would tell everyone. Then everyone would kiss my ass. And take care of me. Tell me how much they love me. Wipe my ass when I had to go to the bathroom. They'd be crying and sad, and that would make me feel really good.
M	IRA	He doesn't want to be that guy. He picked up two girls at a bar. Then he had sex with his. And then he came out and had sex with mine.
M	MARK	In front of you?
M	IRA	No.
M	MARK	So being terminally ill makes you a cock-blacker?
M	IRA	No, what I'm saying is...He's so lost right now that he's hiding from the world. And he's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women. And he doesn't want anyone to know but me.
M	MARK	Why you?
M	IRA	Because he doesn't know me. So he doesn't give a shit.
M	LEO	That's kind of insulting.
M	IRA	No, I think we had kind of an instant connection. The other roommate, JAY, walks by.
M	JAY	You fucked him?
M	IRA	Shut up, Jay. Jay keeps walking.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	I feel like he's crying out for help, and I can help him. He's made us so happy in our lives, this is our chance to do something from him during this time. There's a lot of wisdom we can take from this. What he's going through. We can apply it to our lives. Like how to bang two chicks in the same night, even though you have a terminal disease?
M	IRA	No, what is life all about? What is important? How should we decide to live this precious life? REVEAL that Mark is crying.
M	MARK	we're high. It really freaks me out and it makes me sad and it scares me. I don't want to talk about this shit.
M	IRA	That's why we should talk about it! You can't run from it, man. This could make us into better people. This is an opportunity.
M	LEO	I don't want to talk about this shit until I'm 80. I'm 24 years old.
M	IRA	Well I'm going to fucking learn something. Mark cries even more.
M	MARK	When my grandfather died, we were in a room with no windows. And they said he was dead. And there was a candle. And it started flickering like he was blowing it out. But there were no windows. We all thought that was him going to heaven.
M	LEO	You have to go through fire to get to heaven? That wasn't him going to heaven, that was him going to hell.
M	MARK	Fuck you guys. I was trying to open up. I'll never do it again. You're just being mean because I'm making twenty-five thousand dollars an episode.
M	IRA	Hello.
F	GEORGE	Hey. You want to see if we can get on-stage somewhere?
M	IRA	Sure.
F	GEORGE	I was thinking about it. I could throw you some money every week for coming up with new jokes for me. Maybe you can organize them in the computer, keep track of what I'm doing.
M	IRA	Absolutely. What do you want to pay me? They close the doors, drive off.
F	GEORGE	I'll throw you $1500 a week.
M	IRA	Okay, that could work. We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's
M	IRA	I was thinking maybe you should do some material about what you're going through, being sick. There could be something really powerful, and it would mean a lot to people, that you would share that with them.
F	GEORGE	I'm just doing stand-up to have fun, forget about it on stage. There's nothing funny about that.
M	IRA	It could be classic stuff. For the ages.
F	GEORGE	Fuck classic stuff. Idon't give a shit what people think of my shit when I'm dead. Why don't you wait till you're about to die and then you do a bit about it? I'll bet you're about-to-die shit will be funnier than my about-to-die shit.
F	GEORGE	I ordered your Roast Beef. And normally it's delicious. But this time I paid a price!
M	DELI MANAGER	I'm very sorry ma'am. What if you come in and I give you a free sandwich?
F	GEORGE	Well that's very nice of you. But I have one question for you. Can I get two sandwiches? George motions for Ira to do something.
M	IRA	Grandma! Get off the fucking phone. Don't run up my fucking bill. Ira starts slapping his hands together. George screams in
M	DELI MANAGER	Ma'am! Are you okay?
F	GEORGE	This is a family matter! He can hit me if he wants. He's my grandson, and I love him! Now may I give you my name, so you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that? Can you say it back to me?
M	IRA	George? George? He walks through the house, finds George in bed. For the
M	IRA (CONT'D)	Are you all right?
F	GEORGE	No, I had a bad night last night. I was sweating though the sheets, couldn't stop. So I got up, watched half of a season of The Wire and then I slept till...what time is it now?
M	IRA	It's three in the afternoon.
F	GEORGE	I wanted to get up and do something. But I don't think I have it in me. I may just go back to bed. Well do you need anything?
F	GEORGE	Yeah, I need all sorts of things. But nothing you can get me. You should go up anyway. You were in a groove the other night, you don't want to get rusty.
M	IRA	I. .I. .can't anyway. I'm doing the late shift at the deli counter.
F	GEORGE	Really? How long you gonna keep that job for? I'm paying you good money. What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph's and sees you cutting turkey?
M	IRA	I know, I just want to be safe, make sure I can pay my bills. I don't like to be nervous about that shit.
F	GEORGE	I wasn't like you. I had a different theory. You've got to spend money to make money. Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt. Maybe we should go buy a Corvette. That'll make you try to be funnier.
F	CHUCK	so how much notice are you giving me?
M	IRA	Notice? I'm not giving you any notice. I'm just quitting.
F	CHUCK	You're supposed to give notice. That's what people do.
M	IRA	Why would I give you notice? I'm not trying to stay in Ralph's good graces. I'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph's. I'm just quitting. You don't quit and then keep working for two weeks.
F	CHUCK	Well I don't have enough people to cover all your shifts, now I gotta cover them.
M	IRA	I wish I could help you, but I'll kill myself if I keep working here. It's not what I want to do. Maybe Gail can cover my shifts.
F	CHUCK	Gail can't work weekends, and my kid's birthday is this weekend. What am I supposed to do?
M	IRA	I don't know. Get someone to cover from a different Ralph's. There are thousands of them in Southern California. No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl? I'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph's from falling into chaos.
F	CHUCK	You're an asshole. You always thought you were slumming it here. Go tell your tucking fart jokes., Get the fuck out of here before I kick the shit out of you.
M	IRA	You know what? I'm glad you said that, because I was about to tell you I could work this weekend. What's your problem? I didn't say anything bad about you, I just said I didn't want to work for Ralph's anymore. Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him. Ira
M	IRA (CONT'D)	I'll tell Dave. I'll tell Dave. I tried to do this politely. The thanks I get. Ira walks out the store. As he walks out, he turns to a lady
M	IRA (CONT'D)	See you, Phyllis. You're nice.
M	IRA	Hey, Daisy.
F	DAISY	Hey --
M	IRA	Ira.
F	DAISY	I know.
M	IRA	I was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see Wilco at the Greek Theatre. You want to come? Are you into them at all?
F	DAISY	I would love to come. That would be amazing.
M	IRA	Okay. I'll call you with the details. Hopefully I'll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered binoculars.
F	DAISY	I don't care where the seats are. I just like to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts,
M	IRA	Perfect. Then I can play you their live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats. That won't work.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	That wasn't funny at all. I'm gonna leave while I'm ahead right now. She smiles. He walks away.
M	IRA	George? Ira walks into George's bedroom. He hears something, pokes In the dark, he can barely see George making phoney calls by
F	GEORGE	I was robbed! One second you're walking down the street with your Visa card, having a grand old time, and then you've got a fucking gun in your mouth!
M	VISA LADY	What's the number of the card, Ma'am?
F	GEORGE	I don't know! The thief has the card, why don't you ask the thief the number of the card! George hangs up the phone. He starts dialing.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Ah yes, I came into your comedy club tonight and I was very offended by the performer. I did not pay good money to have the so- called "comedian" shake my wife's hand, then smell it and say, "Did you have fish for dinner?" That is not my idea of entertainment. Ira leaves the room, feeling like he's intruded on a private
M	IRA	I was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation... your condition.
F	GEORGE	No, no. IÃ¢â¬Â¢ don't want to do that.
M	IRA	I feel like maybe you're holding everything in and I can understand why you don't want to deal with it because why would anyone want to deal with it. But I bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends. Wouldn't it make you feel a lot better to get your affairs in order? What do people do at this moment Don't they have to do stuff?
F	GEORGE	I don't want to do anything. I just want to be in the moment and live every day the best I can. As soon as I confront it with everybody, everything's changed and I can't get back.
M	IRA	Everything has changed. At some point you're going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you. I'm sure there's a lot of business, estate issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll feel better than if you just deal with everything. Where are your parents?
F	GEORGE	P4y parents would drop dead if I told them what was happening. They're in their 80s. They don't have to go through this. I'll make sure they find out at the last possible second.
M	IRA	Friends?
F	GEORGE	I don't think I do. I thought I did. I got a lot of people I know, shoot the shit with, fuck around with. But I realized when this happened I'm not close to anyone. I had no one to call. My friendships are Hollywood friendships. When I was lying in bed I couldn't think of one person I wanted to share this with. Maybe it's me, maybe I never got close to anybody.
M	IRA	I think if you talk to people you'd find out a lot of people care about you. You're kind of old already, I mean, compared to me. I'm sure you touched a lot of people's lives. You can't spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your room.
F	GEORGE	The only reason I did that was because I couldn't sleep. And I had no one to call.
M	IRA	Well maybe that's the problem. Maybe if you told more people you'd have more people to call. You can't just talk to me about it, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You're the first person I've known who's sick. I'm not good at it. You've given me diarrhea, I'm nervous about you and I'm in over my head.
F	GEORGE	Don't cry in front of me, man. I can't start that.
M	IRA	I'm sorry.
F	GEORGE	Seriously. I can't...I can't have you do that. George really begins to cry. Please don't do that.
M	IRA	I won't do it, I promise, man. Ira wipes the tears from his face. New tears immediately
M	IRA (CONT'D)	That was first and last time. I'm not even crying anymore. You're still crying.
M	IRA	I don't think I am. I think I'm not anymore. I'm not sure what you're talking about.
F	GEORGE	Okay, as long as we got that straight. George takes a napkin and puts it over his face.
M	IRA	I'm sorry, George. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to help you.
F	GEORGE	No, you're right. I really should tell some people. It just sucks, man. It just sucks. And they're going to feel so bad, I don't even want to look at them and tell them.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	I'd rather drop dead. of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a nightmare. This is a total nightmare.
M	IRA	Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on?
F	GEORGE	Yeah.
M	IRA	Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no.
M	IRA	Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of George's. He asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the
M	IRA (CONT'D)	Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Ira slam the door. I'm sorry. I have some news about George.
F	GEORGE	So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it.
M	COMEDIAN #1	That's very gay.
M	COMEDIAN#2	No, it was a buddy thing. It was very heterosexual.
F	GEORGE	Admit it, you were masturbating.
M	COMEDIAN#2	Of course I was whacking it. What else am I gonna do, not whack it?
F	GEORGE	And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh.
M	COMEDIAN #2	I think at one point you said, "Say my hog is the biggest you've ever seen." And then there is this long pause.
M	COMEDIAN#3	That's a bad sign. If it was big at all she wouldn't have paused.
M	COMEDIAN #1	Remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger in their little hands. They all laugh.
M	COMEDIAN #2	Yeah, you used to get all the girls, man. Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and
M	EX-MANAGER	And I feel horrible about it, but the truth is, I was having some issues with gambling, and you were doing so well-and so I took a million dollar check you got in from the studio and I used it to clear up some debts. And I did it with the intention of paying you right back before you noticed. But you never noticed, and I just never got around to paying you back.
M	COVERT	You fucking blew us off. You cocksucker.
M	LISA	You have to tell mom and dad.
F	GEORGE	I will tell them, but right at the end. I don't want them to go through all this. I can't put them through this.
M	LISA	I wish I wasn't so mad at you. I want to be there for you, but I am so mad at you.
F	GEORGE	I wish I was a better brother.
M	LISA	You weren't even a brother. You just left when I was a little kid. You left me there all alone, and you never treated me like a sister again.
F	GEORGE	You live so far away. I visited you in Kansas a few years ago.
M	LISA	That was six years ago, and you were only there because you had a concert. My five-year-old has never even met you. George does not know what to say.
M	LISA (CONT'D)	And I wanted to bring her, but then I thought she would just fall in love with you and get attached, and then what? I didn't want to do that to her.
F	GEORGE	Thanks a lot, pal. This is everything I didn't want to happen. It's like being at my own funeral.
M	IRA	Afterwards you'll be happy you did it.
F	GEORGE	No, I won't.
M	FRIEND	It is such a tucked up situation. Life is fucked. It makes no sense.
F	GEORGE	Well, I really appreciate you coming by.
M	FRIEND	This is why I can't be close with people. What is the point?
F	GEORGE	Exactly. Well, I really need to rest...
M	FRIEND	The worst part is at night, when the TV gets turned off, and it is quiet...
F	GEORGE	It was so good to see you. George stands up and exits the room. Ira walks over.
M	IRA	I think George is going to take a nap now.
M	FRIEND	Oh, okay.
M	BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN	You're about to merge with the eternal. We're all going to die. No one gets out of here alive, right? George nods.
M	BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (CONT'D)	You lived five lives, fucker. You're 200 years old in my book. The fun you've had, the money, the adventures, the women you've known. Who wouldn't want to change places with you right new?
F	GEORGE	I guess so, but...
M	BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN	You know what? There is no tomorrow, no yesterday. Only right now, and it's fucking beautiful. You need to shut the fuck up right now. Have you been browsing the self-help section at Barnes and Noble? Is this what you say in between songs these days? I'm going to go right now and delete all your songs off my iPod.
M	BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN	I'm sorry. I didn't know what to say. I just got nervous. background.
F	GEORGE	This is awful. Awful. I hate you for having me do this.
M	IRA	You have to, you have no choice. You're doing good. And you're almost done, don't worry.
F	GEORGE	Well what are we going to do when it's over, when we're done tomorrow? Because then I'm not talking to anyone.
M	IRA	I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere. You're still physically doing well, and that's not going to last forever. You should do something active. Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or something. Or do something crazy. Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or wherever they have mountains. I don't know, I don't even ski, but you do. Maybe you should do something like that. Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more
M	IRA (CONT'D)	If it's too hard, we can just ski for an hour or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar. You can hit on hot ski instructors, and then I can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors. He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the mountain air, fun to look at the mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even be here. We can hang out there as long as you want, I got nothing to do. Ira closes the door.
F	GEORGE	Thanks for coming down. You didn't have to do that, i appreciate it.
F	LAURA	I wanted to, I wanted to see you.
F	GEORGE	I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you.
F	LAURA	You don't have to be sorry, that was like 12 years ago. Everything worked out for the best. We see this hurts George.
F	GEORGE	I screwed everything up. I could have been married to you now.
F	LAURA	Don't do this.
F	GEORGE	We could've had a family . I don't have a family, I'm all alone here.
F	LAURA	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what's happening to you.
F	GEORGE	You know, maybe I deserve it. I screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life. I cheated on you. For no reason at all. Just young and stupid. And selfish. I'm sorry.
F	LAURA	Maybe I over reacted. I didn't have to leave you.
F	GEORGE	Yes you did. ANGLE ON: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes
F	LAURA	And the funny thing is...my husband, he is on the road a lot for business. He did the same thing last year.
F	GEORGE	Did you leave him?
F	LAURA	No. I have kids now.
F	GEORGE	See, that was my mistake. I should have had some kids with you before I cheated. she laughs.
F	LAURA	You were the one and only magic relationship in. my life. She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace.
F	GEORGE	Me too. They cry, forehead to forehead.
F	LAURA	There's never been anything like you before or since. I love Chris, but it's not the same. It's fine, maybe it isn't even fine, but we had something special.
F	GEORGE	I'm so sorry. I really loved you. And I do love you.
F	LAURA	I love you too George. I wish there was something I could do.
F	GEORGE	Don't set me up for jokes like that. You're ruining the moment. She smiles. They hug.
M	IRA	Hey. How's it going?
F	DAISY	Good. Mark walks out in a bathrobe.
M	MARK	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were sleeping at your boyfriend's again tonight.
M	IRA	I guess it's been more than ten days.
M	MARK	It's been 21 days. I gave you an extra 11.
F	DAISY	What are you guys talking about?
M	IRA	Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter, I don't give a shit. Leo walks in the front door.
M	LEO	I just fucking killed at the Improv. Bud Freidman fucking loves me. Leo realizes he's walked into the middle of an awkward They said they're gonna start giving me good spots on the weekends.
M	IRA	I've been getting good weekend spots.
M	LEO	Well, that's because they think if they book you, George will show up.
M	IRA	What's with you guys? You both want to fuck my mother too? What more do you want to do to me tonight? Ira walks away.
M	LEO	I really did kill. Did you guys just bone, or something?
M	LEO (CONT'D)	I'm getting a little vibe here. It's getting me excited.
M	IRA	So now you're with Mark? You're his girl?
F	DAISY	I just went out with him one night.
M	IRA	You got a lot accomplished in one night. How did this happen?
F	DAISY	He invited me to a taping of his show and we hit it off.
M	IRA	Must have been a great episode. I should get a job on a shitty show so I can use it as foreplay.
F	DAISY	What are you talking about? Don't treat me like that.
M	IRA	I am not treating you like anything. Do what you want. I don't give a shit. I'll go to Wilco alone.
F	DAISY	What planet are you from? The one where everyone is perfect like you, you judgemental fuck?
M	IRA	How could you do that? I thought we were going out on a date.
F	DAISY	We are going on a date. I didn't plan it. Am I not allowed to do stuff because we're going out on a .date? What the fuck's the matter with you?
M	IRA	I bought tickets to Wilco and I worked all week to get a reservation at a place that doesn't normally let people like me eat there. I just didn't see this coming. Yes, you're right. You can do anything you want. I'm glad this fucking happened, before I wasted the night with you. I didn't think you were that kind of person. That you would sleep with a guy like that.
F	DAISY	He's your roommate. You don't like him?
M	IRA	No, I think he's a pussyhound.
F	DAISY	Well, I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. I wasn't trying to hurt you. It just happened.
M	IRA	You got excited because he's the star of the show. You literally star-fucked.
F	DAISY	Yes, you're right. I'm awful. Give me a break. I don't even know you.
M	MARK	I told you I was going to give you 10 days. That was three weeks ago.
M	IRA	I thought you were joking.
M	MARK	I didn't know she actually mattered to you. We talk about girls we want to fuck all the time.
M	IRA	I just bought these two Wilco tickets. Wanna go?
M	MARK	I would, but I'm going with Tobey Maguire. He wants me to play his younger brother in some movie.
F	GEORGE	You know, I never got married. I never had kids. I didn't get to do a lot of things I thought I would do. But I was pretty fucking funny, right?
M	IRA	Come on, are you kidding me? We all want to be you. Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you. People love your shit.
F	GEORGE	Well, I made a lot of people laugh. I guess that's something.
M	IRA	It's a lot.
F	GEORGE	Yeah. I guess so. They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Look at that crazy motherfucker. George and Ira start watching the act and laughing along,
F	GEORGE	I never understood why people hiked before. I think I get it now. I don't. George says something that makes his DAD laugh.
M	IRA	What are you doing?
F	GEORGE	I'm feeling good, so I'm going to the doctor.
M	IRA	You're not feeling good?
F	GEORGE	No, I'm feeling good. It's kind of weirding me out.
M	GEORGE (CONT-D)	I don't feel sick at all, and it's scaring me. I feel like I'm just going to drop dead. Am I not going to feel bad at all, and then one day wake up dead? It's disconcerting.
M	DOCTOR STEVENS	I don't want to get your hopes up. We put you on this experimental medication without much optimism, but as of right now I don't see any traces of the disease in your blood work. I don't want to speak too soon, but we may have beaten this thing.
F	GEORGE	Well what the fuck do I do now?
M	IRA	Oh my god, oh my god! Ira goes to hug George, but it's a very awkward moment. Ira
M	TNT. OFFICE	George is sitting at his computer. Ira is also seated.
F	GEORGE	I really want to thank you for your help through this time.
M	IRA	I was happy to help.
F	GEORGE	Well, you didn't have to, and you were really there for me. I was thinking, maybe we should write a movie together.
M	IRA	Uh-huh.
F	GEORGE	I feel like I've learned a lot, and I wanna use this good place I'm in right now to do something really creative. I would pay you, certainly. I make, you know, about a million dollars to write a script. I can't give you half, but maybe one hundred, two hundred grand, but we'll figure it out.
M	IRA	Yeah, we'll figure it out.
F	GEORGE	I thought a lot about my work when I was sick and I'm in sort of a strange place career-wise, because I'm normally the goofy, funny guy and I don't know if people are expecting a change from me. And I think people are expecting me to evolve, and it's important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why I'm not evolving.
M	IRA	It's always good to keep breaking new ground.
F	GEORGE	Is that something they taught you at the deli. I'm not asking you for your advice, I just though we could start trying to come up with an idea.
M	IRA	Well, I'm gonna start thinking. And...I'm really happy for you. Are you freaking out right now?
F	GEORGE	It's very strange. It's gonna take me a few days to process it, but it's a gift and I'm going to treat it that way.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	I learned a lot from being sick and it's gonna help me make some good choices, and be a good person from now on.
M	IRA	And he thanked me for helping him, and I really think I was a help during this time. I'm not saying that's why he got better, but he definitely had good energy and I hear that helps your immune system.
M	MOM	He's going to pay you two hundred thousand dollars to write a movie script?
M	IRA	I don't know, he said one or two hundred thousand.
M	BOB	One or two hundred thousand? That's pretty vague. That's a wide range. I'd push him toward two hundred thousand if I were you.
M	IRA	Thank you for the advice, Bob. That's very helpful.
M	MOM	This is good because now you can help with your sister's college tuition.
M	IRA	What are you talking about?
M	MOM	Your younger sister got accepted to Boston University but, as you know, your father and I aren't in the position to pay for it.
M	IRA	So I have to? I just stopped working at a supermarket two weeks ago. I'm trying to create some financial stability for myself. The first time I make any real money, I can't just give it to her.
M	BOB	Well that's very selfish.
M	IRA	Well you guys went on a cruise to Greece last year. Maybe you shouldn't have gone, and saved for her college education.
M	MOM	Oh, so after all we've done for you, we can't have any fun? We should never take a vacation?
M	IRA	I had to drop out of college after two years because you couldn't pay for it. Now I have to pay for hers? Let her figure it out. Let her get a job.
M	BOB	I didn't realize I raised such a selfish boy. When I was young I would have done anything for my family.
M	IRA	Then sell your house. Move into a smaller house. Use the extra money to pay for her college. Or tell her to work for a year or two, make some money, then she can pay for her own college. No one helped me out, I'm just digging out from under now.
M	BOB	Don't get so high up on your horse with all your Hollywood friends. I don't like what you're turning into.
M	IRA	One good thing happens to me in my entire life, and you have to try and take it away and ruin it.
M	MOM	I don't even know where you came from.
M	BOB	Don't bother showing up for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is just for families.
M	IRA	Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come? It's just for us losers who don't have any family to eat with.
M	LEO	He's not gonna email back.
M	MARK	He's never gonna want to eat Thanksgiving with us. The computer BINGS. The guys scream in delight.
M	IRA	Sure. What time? Do you need me to bring anything? 3 O'clock at my apartment. Bring wine that we can't afford. The computer bings.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	That's pretty much all wine on earth. See you then. Email back and say: If you can, bring that hot chick from your last movie. We definitely have room for her. Well, then maybe just bring grain alcohol then. They all start laughing. The computer BINGS again.
M	IRA	Hey Faggots, I know what you're doing. Stop emailing me. It's not amusing anymore. They all start high--fiving.
M	LEO	He called us faggots! Daisy walks up, site down next to Ira.
F	DAISY	What have you been up to? I haven't seen you at the Improv.
M	IRA	I've just been busy. Will you excuse me? Ira gets up, walks out of the room. Leo opens the door, sweaty, with a welt on his face.
M	LEO	Hey, George. How are you? Come on in. Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on
M	MARK	Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in.
M	LEO	We're really glad you could come have Thanksgiving with us. It's a big thrill.
F	GEORGE	It's weird, I feel like the old guy in the room. When I started out I was always the young guy. It's strange how fast you become the old guy. And I feel exactly the same.
M	MARK	Well, you don't know us, but you're with friends and admirers.
F	GEORGE	I know you, I've watched your show. "'Nuff Said." It's a good show.
M	IRA	You don't have to lie to him. He knows it's not good.
F	GEORGE	No, it's good, it's cute. I like it. I know it's not that funny, but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again.
F	GEORGE	Don't be ashamed, it's good. But what about that girl on the show? How old is she? Tell me she's 25.
M	MARK	No, she's 15.
F	GEORGE	Holy shit! I feel bad. I don't want to tell you what I did watching that show. Are you serious? She's 15?
M	MARK	No, she's actually 20.
F	GEORGE	Okay, good. Now I don't feel so bad. Their weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up.
M	FUTORAN	I heard you were sick and now you're better. Is that like, really... what's that like?
F	GEORGE	It's kinda like 9/11. You know after 9/11 you kind of liked everybody? But then it went away. It's like that.
M	LEO	Did you think you were gonna go to heaven? Did you count up your sins?
F	GEORGE	I don't believe in any of that stuff, but I was hoping I was headed somewhere. I felt like I was.
M	FUTORAN	I think you just wind up in the dirt. Worm food.
M	IRA	Come on, Futoran, we're about to eat.
F	GEORGE	Well, it's easy to think that way until you're headed for the dirt. Then your mind opens up a little bit, you know? Maybe it's desperation, or maybe you just start to see more of the big plan. Luckily I got a little more time before I find out. Daisy pops her head into the room.
F	DAISY	Food's ready.
F	GEORGE	May I say the prayer? Everyone nods yes.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Everyone hold hands. Thank you for the gifts this year. Thank you for And hopefully next year I'll get to screw that girl on Mark's show. All our dreams will come true. You guys will get an apartment with less pubic hair on the toilet seat, you'll be able to afford a maid. Maybe next year you guys can get a better celebrity than me. Maybe Wolf Blitzer will come. I also pray that no one put their balls on this turkey, I'm kind of scared you guys are about to give me salmonella poisoning. I know this Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a normal Thanksgiving for you guys, but it's a very special one for me. I'm very glad to be here. I'm not that glad to be here with you, but I thank you for having me. I'm sure it will be very memorable for you. Now let's find out what Leo's balls taste like.
F	GEORGE	This guy wrote me some funny jokes for that Mac gig. I asked for some jokes and he sent me about a hundred. Seriously. This guy sent me jack shit. If you want to succeed you need a work ethic like Ira over here.
M	LEO	Why wouldn't I have sent you jokes? You didn't ask me for jokes.
F	GEORGE	Sure I did. I asked you and Ira to write me jokes and you flaked. Leo's eyes widen with anger.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Ira wrote this joke about Leopard, it was really funny. Do the joke, Ira.
M	IRA	I don't want to right now.
F	GEORGE	It was like, what's great about. Leopard is you can watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. This guy's fucking funny. Leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	You guys look like a cute couple, you should go out.
F	DAISY	well, the truth is we had a date, but I went out with Mark first and he broke it off.
M	IRA	I didn't expect you to blurt it out like that. That was very honest of you.
F	GEORGE	If I didn't go out with every girl one of my friends slept with... let me put it another way. If none of my friends went out with girls I went out with, none of them would have gotten laid. So, are you guys dating now?
F	DAISY	No.
M	IRA	This is making me uncomfortable. The whole thing, it makes me uncomfortable.
F	GEORGE	You guys are young, why are you taking everything so seriously? As someone who's been through a lot recently, let me tell you something. The worst thing you can do is hold grudges and be judgmental. Everyone's making mistakes, everyone's screwing up. You guys are cute together. George points at Mark.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	I know that Mark's not good in bed. Don't tell me he was a good lay. He can't have a big dick. Look at Ira. He's thick. He's gotta have a thick dick.
F	DAISY	Actually, I have a really skinny vagina, so I'm not really into thick.
F	GEORGE	See? She's funny. She can take a joke, she's not sensitive. I think I'm falling in love with both of you. George stands.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	I'm gonna walk away now, causing an awkward moment, that will be followed by a true moment, filled with chemistry. I'm walking away now. Let the awkwardness begin. George walks out of the room.
F	DAISY	My brother's going to freak out that I met Davey. Did you go to the Wilco show?
M	IRA	I actually scalped them and made a hundred bucks.
F	DAISY	Well at last you didn't lose any money on the deal.
M	IRA	I'm sorry I got so upset with you, because it shows you how much I like you, which is weird because we've hardly spoken. I understand all of that.
F	DAISY	Well, attraction is all about smells, pheromones.
M	IRA	Well, you smell right to me. Daisy smiles at Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room.
M	LEO	You're a fucking prick, You're a piece of shit thief motherfucker. You stole a job from me, you stole my joke.
F	DAISY	You stole his joke?
M	7l.	The moment is ruined. Ira doesn't know what to say.
M	LEO	He asked for me to write jokes too and you didn't tell me!
M	IRA	Uh...yes.
M	LEO	You .fucker!
M	IRA	I didn't think you would want to.
M	LEO	Why wouldn't I want to? What, I don't like money? I don't like private jets?
M	IRA	I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the gig. And you are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for myself.
M	LEO	It wasn't yours to keep for yourself. You lied to me.
M	IRA	I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I don't know what to say.
M	LEO	Don't say anything. Just get your shit, and get out of the apartment.
M	IRA	Are you serious?
M	LEO	You don't get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode. That is a terrible strategy. I don't know what the fuck has happened to you--but my name is on the lease, and I don't want to live with it.
M	IRA	I never told Leo because I wanted the gig?
F	GEORGE	I didn't know you were fucking over your friend. Don't yell at me.
M	IRA	Well I fucking live with you now because he told me to leave.
F	GEORGE	He kicked you out for that.
M	IRA	He said friends don't lie and I'm fucking with his career.
F	GEORGE	Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you. That's kind of cool. I got you kicked out.
M	IRA	Fuck off.
F	GEORGE	This should be comfortable in here. This room is almost as big as your old apartment.
M	IRA	Thank you for letting me stay here.
F	GEORGE	No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me while I crash?
M	IRA	No. You want to come talk to me while I crash?
F	GEORGE	All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George closes his eyes.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Terry's ready for you.
F	GEORGE	I was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script "Making Amends."
M	TERRY	Do you really think people want to see you make a movie about a guy who goes to AA but isn't really an alcoholic? He just needs the companionship? That's a pretty big left turn.
F	GEORGE	I got money. I want to challenge myself. You said you liked it.
M	TERRY	You know, I read it four years ago. I need to read it again. I don't remember not liking it. I just can't tell you the studio will make it. Your last few movies didn't do so well.
F	GEORGE	I thought they did well overseas.
M	TERRY	You always do well in Australia, but that's about it.
F	GEORGE	What if I do it for no money, just with back-end?
M	TERRY	I don't know if that's going to cut it either. The head of the studio does a lot of drinking, I don't think he finds that whole area funny. Maybe if you commit to do another one of the Davey movies, I could tie it to that, so they have to do both.
F	GEORGE	I'vedone four Davey movies.They wantme to do another sequelto that?We don't even have ascript.
M	TERRY	Wellthere's this great script goingaround town, Happy Holidays. Whichis about an immature 40 year old man who acts like a kid. In it he comes home for the holiday season for the first time in ten years. And havoc ensues. You get to make fun of Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah and Christmas and New Years. They say they can turn it into a Davey movie.
F	GEORGE	Could I at least shoot the Making Amends movie first?
M	TERRY	No.
F	GEORGE	Maybe I'll just write something myself.
M	TERRY	I wish you would. You've never been able to do it in the past. You always talk a big game about writing your own shit. But I've yet to see a script land on my desk.
M	IRA	See, the thing I was thinking, was...you always play an immature guy. What if the joke of the movie is you're incredibly smart, intellectual and well-mannered. You just go the opposite way with it.
F	GEORGE	There's nothing funny about being smart. All comedy comes from immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin. They were all immature. They were all knuckleheads. Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally? What's funny about that? What else you got?
M	IRA	I. .I gotta go through my notes.
F	GEORGE	I'm thinking about taking a gig, and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground.
M	IRA	Well we'll still write the script, right?
F	GEORGE	Yeah, if we can come up with an idea.
M	IRA	Let's just keep banging at it.
F	GEORGE	I can't. I've got a date.
M	IRA	You have a date? Who do you have a date with?
F	GEORGE	This woman my agent set me up with. She raises money for this environmental group. I guess she's like a normal person. I can't live here alone in this house forever. I need something of significance in my life. So I'm gonna go out on some dates. No pressure.
M	IRA	You know what you should do, just as an experiment? You should try and not fuck her?
F	GEORGE	Why would you say that?
M	IRA	Because you're always saying you don't know if women like you for who you are. You don't know if they like you because you have money or you're famous. Why not take some time and get to know them before ass-raping them. In a romantic way.
F	GEORGE	That's insulting. Don't take out your frustrations on me because you can't get laid by acting like I'm some sort of deviant. I'm an adult. I have adult sexual relationships. No one does what they don't want to do. Sex is how people decide if they like each other. I'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them.
M	IRA	See, you can't do it. You can't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them.
F	GEORGE	That's not true. I'm bored of sex, anyway. There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I haven't experimented with. There is nothing left to do. There is no nationalities I haven't.slept with, no age groups I haven't slept with. I'm fully ready for normal.
M	IRA	What nationalities have you slept with?
F	GEORGE	US. Canada. Mexico. England. France. Spain. North Korea. Burma. Rwanda. Kenya. Tibet. Serbia. Chechnya. Iran. The Green Zone. Darfur. The Killing Fields of Cambodia. Mongolia. What about you?
M	IRA	New Jersey. Do handjobs count? Because then also California.
F	GEORGE	You know, I haven't been out on a blind date, ever. This may be the first one.
F	RACHEL	Oh I go out on them all the time. I've been on a bunch of J Dates.
F	GEORGE	What's J Date?
F	RACHEL	It's a website where Jewish people find each other.
F	GEORGE	So it's just a list of all the Jewish people? I thought we didn't liked to be tracked and monitored like that. She looks at him, doesn't get the joke.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	You know, because of the... holocaust.
F	RACHEL	It's just a great way for like- minded people to meet.
F	GEORGE	What if you don't like Jews? She just stares at him.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	I'm joking. So, uh, I hear you raise uh money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying.
F	RACHEL	It is, because, fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books. We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act. You know, one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year.
F	GEORGE	See? That's why I still drive a big truck. I stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down.
F	RACHEL	I know you're joking, but it's a very serious situation. People like you do a lot of damage to the environment. Whether it's taking a private jet by yourself, or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses. Your carbon footprint is huge.
F	GEORGE	You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint? Big dick.
F	GEORGE	Come on. We're gonna go do a gig tonight. Up north. And you're gonna open up for me.
M	IRA	How big a theater?
F	GEORGE	I think two thousand.
M	IRA	You should have told me so I could have prepared. I've never played a place that big. How long do you want me to do?
F	GEORGE	Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can get there.
M	IRA	Shit.
F	GEORGE	Dress nice. Tickets are expensive.
M	IRA	I don't own anything nice.
M	THE	Ira is driving George's Mercedes. George sits in backseat watching "Cloverfield" on a built-in DVD
M	IRA	How fucking up north is this?
F	GEORGE	Its near San Francisco.
M	IRA	So we have like five more hours to drive?
F	GEORGE	It's not that far. It's like two more movies.
M	IRA	I don't like how you made me your limo driver. It's weird you're in the back and I'm up here.
F	GEORGE	I'd sit up front but the DVD player is back here.
M	IRA	I can't even listen to the radio because you're watching the movie. Can I sit back there and you drive?
F	GEORGE	No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss the exit. We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Holy shit!
M	IRA	What happened?
F	GEORGE	The monster showed himself. Great.
F	GEORGE	Hey, you made it.
F	LAURA	I wouldn't have missed it for the world, thanks for inviting me.
F	GEORGE	You remember Ira.
F	LAURA	Hi Ira. Are you performing tonight?
M	IRA	I'm afraid so. I've been told if I'm good it warms the crowd, and if I'm bad it makes them want George more, so...
F	LAURA	You look great. How are you feeling?
F	GEORGE	I'm hanging in there.
F	LAURA	I thought a lot about you after I left.
F	GEORGE	Me too.
F	LAURA	Well the show is going to start in a minute, I better get to my seat. I just wanted to say hi. Don't be too dirty tonight, you know that makes me uncomfortable.
F	GEORGE	Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have to do an hour and half. She laughs.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Come by after and give me the review.
F	LAURA	Okay. Break a leg. She exits.
M	IRA	You didn't tell her that you're not sick anymore? Why wouldn't you tell her?
F	GEORGE	I need you to do something for me. After your set I gave you a seat right next to her. During the intermission I want yQ.u to tell her I'm not sick anymore.
M	IRA	Me? Why do you want me to tell her?
F	GEORGE	Because it's weird, and emotional. I think she'll handle it better if it comes from somebody else. And then I can talk to her about it afterwards.
M	IRA	That's weird.
F	GEORGE	She'll be happy. It's not weird. You're the bearer of good news.
M	IRA	You had to do this to me right before my set. Like I'm not nervous enough.
F	LAURA	Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so good.
M	IRA	You seem surprised.
F	LAURA	I don't know, you seemed so nervous. But you were really solid all the way though, and your ending hunk really murdered.
M	IRA	Thank you. Hopefully George won't be mad if I tired the audience out.
F	LAURA	I don't think he has anything to worry about. They always go crazy for him. Before he got famous, he used to bomb all the time.
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	And that's when I think he was the funniest. And now that everyone knows him, it's a little too easy for him, I think. No one was funnier when the audience hated him than George. He loved it.
M	IRA	So you guys were dating right when he started doing well?
F	LAURA	Yeah. But you always knew he was gonna do well. He had so much charisma. He would walk into a room and in ten minutes that whole room would be about him. Even before anyone knew who he was.
M	IRA	Where did you meet him?
F	LAURA	I was the hat-check girl at the Improv. And I was acting. I used to do guest spots on all those shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly Hills 90210. I always played the bitch. I don't know why, but I was on the top of the bitch list.
M	IRA	You don't seem like a bitch.
F	LAURA	That's because I was acting.
M	IRA	Sounds like fun days.
F	LAURA	It was, for awhile. Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from
M	IRA	I don't know if you've heard, but it looks like George's medicine is working.
F	LAURA	What do you mean?
M	IPA	When George got sick they didn't think they had any medicine that would help, so they put him on experimental medicine. And the last time he went to the doctor they couldn't detect his blood disease. They think it might be gone. A moment as Laura takes this in.
F	LAURA	Why didn't George tell me?
M	IRA	He just found out. He doesn't want to jinx it. He doesn't want people to get excited, and then have it come back again. The lights go down.
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the man you came to see. George Simmons. The place EXPLODES. I thought everyone came to see me. George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more
F	LAURA	I really don't know what to say. It's not like you weren't good before, but your act is so much more sophisticated, but just as funny. I've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before. You used to say these goofy jokes. It was really something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself.
F	GEORGE	Thanks. A lot has happened. And at least I got some good jokes out of it.
F	LAURA	Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm really glad I came.
F	GEORGE	Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow, I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out. I want to see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband.
F	LAURA	My husband is actually in China for another week, or so. He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses break into that market. So you won't meet him this time, but it would be great if you came by. That would be fun. I'll give you the tour.
F	GEORGE	Okay. We'll come by in the morning.
F	LAURA	Okay. An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	Bye. I'll see you then. She looks at Ira. As she exits-- You were good too.
M	IRA	Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow? The drive is long enough as it is. George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.
F	GEORGE	Here's your money for tonight. Good job.
M	IRA	I'm excited to see her ranch. I hear it's delightful.
M	IRA	Why couldn't we have gotten two different rooms?
F	GEORGE	What's the fun in that? You can go pay for your own room, I don't care.
M	IRA	So, what happened with you and Laura? You seem to get along so well. Why did you cheat on her?
F	GEORGE	I was young, stupid... and I liked fucking girls. Why do you think I cheated? You would do it too if anyone would fuck you.
M	IRA	How many times did you cheat on her?
F	GEORGE	Two or three times ...a week ...for a couple of years.
M	IRA	Jesus.
F	GEORGE	It was awful. There was even marriage talk. My parents didn't want me to do it because she wasn't Jewish. She was taking classes to convert, even. I mean, how cool is that? She was changing religions to be with me. She knew more about being a Jew than I did from those classes. She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong. George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	And then one day, somebody told her, I don't know who. And that was that.
M	IRA	Why do you want to go see her tomorrow? We could do something productive like get some writing done.
F	GEORGE	I like her. I love her. I miss her. I just want to spend a little time with her. I know nothing will come of it. I just miss being around her. A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Anything looking good to you?
M	IRA	I don't want to watch adult movies with you.
F	GEORGE	okay. You want to watch Juno?
M	IRA	Okay. Juno begins playing. They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell. George seems;
M	IRA	You okay, buddy?
F	GEORGE	Yeah, of course I am. Laura opens the door.
F	LAURA	Hi? We've been waiting for you. Come on in.
F	GEORGE	This place is beautiful.
F	LAURA	Thanks. We've been here for five years. I think I just finished decorating it. She leads them through the living room into a huge open
M	IRA	Can I live here?
F	LAURA	of course, you can clean the stables.
F	GEORGE	You have horses?
F	LAURA	Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a real city boy. But for some reason he loves horses. Of course I'm lef t to take care of them. But yes, we have three horses.
M	IRA	That's crazy, owning a horse. I can't even keep a goldfish alive.
F	GEORGE	All right, well, we're ready for the big tour. I want to see how you live. Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the
F	INGRID	Mom! You said you were coming back! We're playing American Idol, you're ruining the game! Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child. This
F	LAURA	I'll come right up. This is my friend, George. And Ira.
F	INGRID	It's my turn to sing and you're supposed to be the judge and you're not in there and I'm very angry!
M	IRA	How old are you?
F	INGRID	Five. But I turn six very soon.
M	IRA	Really? Because I thought you were like nine, about to turn ten.
F	GEORGE	She's very pretty. I like your hair.
F	INGRID	I'm so sick of people telling me they like my hair. George is clearly not that good with kids.
F	GEORGE	Okay. I do not like your hair.
F	INGRID	Don't make fun of me.
F	LAURA	He's just joking Ingrid.
M	IRA	My hair. I have curly hair too. Curly hair is the best.
F	INGRID	Last week my mom straightened it and it almost went to the floor.
M	IRA	If you straighten my hair, I look crazy. I look like the killer from No Country for Old Men. Have you seen that movie? MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.
F	MABLE	You guys left me all alone in the playroom! If you're gonna leave I'm just gonna go talk on the webcam with Caroline.
F	LAURA	Don't be rude. This is Ira and George.
F	MABLE	Oh, I know you. My mom watches your movies all the time. But most of them I'm not allowed to see. George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted.
F	GEORGE	Oh, really? Do you like them? Which one's your favorite?
F	MABLE	I don't know. I don't really like the ones I'm allowed to see, but I think I would like the ones I'm not allowed to see. But she says I cant' see them till I'm sixteen.
F	GEORGE	Sixteen? Just fast-forward past the bad parts.
F	LAURA	The whole thing is a bad part. George LAUGHS in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is
M	LAURA (CONT' D )	C'mon, let's finish the game. You've got the best of both worlds. Rock it out take it slow. And then you rock out the show! Everyone applauds for her.
F	LAURA	Okay. Now it's time to see what the judges say. I thought you had a lot of energy, you're clearly gonna make it to the final four, and I love your outfit. What do you think, Randy?
M	IRA	Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It was a little pitchy in places, but I dug it. I really dug it.
F	MABLE	.I'm Simon, and I thought it was horrible. I don't how you made it this far in the competition. I think Paula is drunk. You will never be American Idol.
F	LAURA	Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to your sister. Say something nice. You were good.
F	LAURA	Okay, you're not Simon anymore. Simon, what did you think?
F	GEORGE	I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Paula. I think you're the one to beat. They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with
F	LAURA	Okay Mable, you're up. Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not I want to go down like London, London.
F	LAURA	I told you not to do that. Simon, what do you think?
F	INGRID	She was horrible! She's a terrible singer! She's inappropriate!
F	LAURA	Okay, who's next? Randy?
M	IRA	I don't know, Dawg. It was a bad song choice. I'm not feeling it.
F	GEORGE	My turn. Get ready to be blown away. George gets up on stage. Take me down to the paradise city. Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty. Oh, won't you please take me home. Just an urchin livin' under the street, I'm a hard case that's tough to beat. I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat. I'll pay you at another time! Take it to the end of the line!
F	MABLE	Boo!
F	INGRID	Boo!
F	GEORGE	What? It's Paradise City, by Guns and Roses.
F	INGRID	You sound like a girl!
F	MABLE	Vote him off!
F	LAURA	All right! Here we go. They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him,
M	MABLE (O.S.)	Mom! Mom! Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour.
F	GEORGE	Ira, Laura invited us to stay over for dinner.
M	IRA	But it's like a seven, eight hour drive home. If we stay for dinner, we're not going to get home till like four in the morning. George stares at Ira for a beat, then --
F	GEORGE	Don't worry, we'll figure it out. You have something to do in the morning?
M	IRA	No.
F	GEORGE	Then everything will be fine.
F	LAURA	Me and George are gonna go to the supermarket and buy some food so I can cook dinner. You think you'll be okay watching the kids? It'll only take forty-five minutes.
M	IRA	Sure. I'm great with kids. I was a camp counselor for five years. Camp Winadu. Kids love me. I'm like a human teddy bear.
F	GEORGE	This town is so small and adorable. It's like out of a Demi Moore movie.
F	LAURA	Clarke's company is about forty- five minutes from here. This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house. There's no traffic, there's one coffee house, one bookstore, one market. No crime. But after you've lived her a few years you hunger for another coffee shop, a bigger bookstore, and a little crime. It gets so boring. And it's such a small town, God forbid you miss one of you kid's soccer games, they put the scarlet letter on you.
F	GEORGE	it can't be that bad. You live on a pretty little ranch. You have horses, a duck. It must be a nice life.
F	LAURA	We used to have so much fun. I don't think I have that much fun anymore. I don't like who I'm turning into. Is the fun over? I have to get up every morning at six, drive my kids to school and then I have 6 hours before I have to pick them up. I have to yell at them to do their homework, be a taskmaster, then I make them dinner. It takes an hour to shower them and put them to bed. And then it's 8:30 and I pass out. And it's great, but tuck. And when both kids are done with high school I'll be 49 years old, and then I'll have probably 6 very healthy years, then I'll kind of slow down and then I'll be an old woman. And that was it. And it's great, but fuck.
F	GEORGE	I couldn't believe you moved out of LA. You were getting some good jobs as an actress. You got to play the bitch on Melrose Place for awhile and make out with Andrew Shue. That was pretty good. Do you miss it?
F	LAURA	Yes. Being a mom is very fulfilling, but there are other parts of me and every once in awhile I go a little crazy.
F	GEORGE	How do you go crazy?
F	LAURA	I just get bored and depressed. And you know how my PMS is kind of out of control. This little boy hit Ingrid in school, and his mom acted like she didn't care at all, so I told her to fuck off. They both laugh.
F	GEORGE	Oh, that must have gotten ugly. How long did that stay awkward for? Always. That woman hates me. And I hate her. And now our kids really like each other, so it's really fucked up.
F	GEORGE	Maybe you weren't acting on Melrose Place. She laughs.
F	LAURA	Screw you.
F	LAURA	And my husband cheated on me, said he did it once but I know because I learned from you, they do it once, they do it all the time. You either cheat or you don't.
F	GEORGE	well I don't anymore. I haven't cheated on anybody since you. I haven't even been in a committed relationship since you, so it's impossible for me to have cheated.
F	LAURA	That's both flattering and deeply disturbing.
F	GEORGE	I thought a lot about you when I was sick, and I would do anything for another chance. I know it creates a mess, but I think it would be worth it. I think we both know it's what we should be doing. He kisses her.
F	LAURA	We can't go the supermarket.
F	GEORGE	Why?
F	LAURA	Because people will see us.
F	GEORGE	So? What's wrong with that?
F	LAURA	Well it'll be weird because we're about to do something we shouldn't do.
M	IRA	If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney. When is George gonna die?
F	INGRID	George is gonna die?
M	IRA	Why would you say that?
F	MABLE	I heard my mom talking to her friend about it on the phone and crying.
F	INGRID	I don't want George to die.
F	MABLE	What do you care? You just met him.
M	IRA	George is gonna be fine.
F	MABLE	They told me my grandfather wouldn't die, but he did.
M	IRA	Here's the truth. George was really sick.
M	IRA (CONT'D)	But he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now he's better. And he's gonna live a long time. The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved.
F	MABLE	I think my mom's in love with him. Ira looks doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his
F	GEORGE	Does somebody in your family like sports? They start passionately making out, slamming into the
F	LAURA	I really never thought I was going to see you again. I grieved for you like you were dead. They continue to kiss. Suddenly she stops. I can't do this.
F	GEORGE	Then let's not do it. She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is
F	LAURA	I gotta get back to the kids. Laura and George are walking into the house. They are not
M	IRA	You're back. That was quick.
F	GEORGE	The town is beautiful.
M	IRA	Where are the groceries?
F	LAURA	We decided ordering in might be a little more fun.
F	LAURA	Food's here! All right, everybody. Let's sit down at the kitchen table. Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you doing home?
M	CLARKE	The man I was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack, if you can believe that. So I decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings. George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting
F	GEORGE	Oh. Hello.
M	CLARKE	Hello.
F	LAURA	Oh, Clarke. George had a performance last night in town, which I went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came by to say hello on their way out of town. There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives
M	CLARKE	It is really nice to meet you, George. Laura talks about you all the time, and we're obviously big fans of your movies.
F	GEORGE	Well, thank you. You've got a great family and a great home.
F	LAURA	I'm so glad you're home, honey. Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.
M	IRA	What's taking so long with the pizza? Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears
M	PIZZA DELIVERY GUY	Hi. That'll be twenty-eight forty- seven, please. This is really great pizza. Thank you very much. It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so surprising because you can't get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you wouldn't think you could get it in Northern California. But this really tastes like New York pizza. A long pause.
F	GEORGE	Sounds like your business is going very well.
M	CLARKE	People never thought China would do this much business with us, you know, but it didn't seem like a risky proposition for me. They've got a billion people, we make all kinds of cool shit in America, they start finding out about it on the internet and what-not. Sooner or later they're gonna find a way to get our shit. He speaks Chinese. For real. Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.
M	CLARKE	You don't think they want new mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm trying to get access into North Korea, no shit. That situation could chance overnight. That is a huge market waiting to be tapped. It's already starting in Cuba.
M	IRA	My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate. He was sickforweeks. He still has it. It'sthekind of thing you can't getridof, you have it for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant.
M	CLARKE	So, George. How are you holding up?
F	GEORGE	Uh...I'm hanging in there.
M	CLARKE	How are you feeling?
F	LAURA	He's doing really well. He's been very strong.
M	CLARKE	It's a terrible situation. I'm so sorry.
F	GEORGE	I appreciate that.
F	LAURA	He's been fighting the good fight. His doctors are taking very good care of him. Ira can believe this conversation is happening.
M	CLARKE	You're a tougher man than me. I don't know how I could go about my day with that hanging over my head.
F	GEORGE	It just makes you appreciate every moment. It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what's important in life.
F	LAURA	Does anybody want seconds? Or should I bring out the desert?
M	IRA	I'd love desert. What do you have? Do you have any ice cream or cake, or anything like that? I have a real big sweet tooth right now. Why don't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now? I've got a better idea, I make a really good milkshake. We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen.
M	TNT. LIVING ROOM	Empty milkshakes litter the coffee table.
M	CLARKE	Do you know who might be able to help you? A Chinese doctor. Have you explored Eastern medicine at all?
F	LAURA	Now's not the time to talk about this.
M	CLARKE	I'm trying to help the man.
F	GEORGE	No, I haven't.
M	CLARKE	Hey. I'm the last guy who would buy into that shit, but it works.
F	LAURA	He really is the last guy who would buy into that shit.
M	CLARKE	Our country's only two hundred years old. The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out. How I got into it, I had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me some herbs that tasted like dogshit, but they worked. I take herbs for my PMS. They really helped.
F	MABLE	Daddy, you've been cursing a lot. You owe me a dollar for every curse. I think you owe me fifty dollars.
F	INGRID	This conversation is scaring me. I don't want George to die.
M	CLARKE	You girls can go play in the other room. The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health. They don't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight off the disease. It works. I've seen it. I wish I could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country. Someone's gonna do it and make a fuck-load of money. Because these people get old, really old. You can't kill these people.
M	IRA	Either that or they're all young and they just look like shit. Clarke laughs.
M	CLARKE	This guy's funny. You should be opening up for this guy. Hey, who wants a drink?
M	CLARKE	I'm going to retire in seven years. I'm done. I'm playing golf for the next fifty years. Work hard now, then get out. That's my plan. I'm putting in the time. Then I'm getting the fuck out. I don't like working. I will do it. I like what it gets me. But I don't like it.
F	GEORGE	You ever see Laura act? She was quite an actress in her day.
F	LAURA	George, stop.
M	CLARKE	That's what I hear. Can't say I watched that much 'Melrose Place' back in the day. She keeps telling me to watch the videos but, you know, I was never a big 'Party of Five' fan.
F	LAURA	Well, I also ran a theatre company. And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed a lot for our family.
M	CLARKE	Okay, if you say so. The Mask was a funny fucking movie. You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in? 'There's Something About Mary.' Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and
M	CLARKE (CONT'D)	I love walking it off after a big meal.
F	GEORGE	It's beautiful here at night.
F	LAURA	There's no pollution here like in LA so you can actually see the stars.
M	IRA	They are beautiful, but we have to get going. We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles.
M	CLARKE	You can't leave now, you won't get back until daylight. You should crash in the guest house. I'm sure it not as fancy pants as where you live, George, but it's better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel.
M	CLARKE (CONT'D)	And if you want to hang out tomorrow I just installed six flatscreens, we can watch all the football games we want. And dog- racing from Florida. There's a big game tomorrow. Ira, you must have played some ball in your day.
M	IRA	No, I'm just big-boned.
F	GEORGE	We probably should get some rest before the drive. All right, show us to our quarters, sir. ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up.
M	CLARKE	You sure you can't stay?
M	IRA	We really do need to get back. I have to visit my mom. I can't miss it. It's her birthday. Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it. She's turning 65. It's very important we get back for it.
F	LAURA	That's too bad, I wish you could stay.
M	CLARKE	I wish I could say I was gonna see you again, but I can't say that. His eyes start to mist up.
F	LAURA	Clarke, don't. You don't need to do that.
M	CLARKE	You know what? I think I do need to do that. One thing I learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it's important to have an open heart, to live in the moment, and to speak the truth to each other. So I'd like to say to you, George, that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife's life. I really like you. And wish we had more time to get to know each other. And I wish you a peaceful end to your journey. And another great journey on the other side of it. Clarke hugs George.
F	GEORGE	I really don't know what to say. I re- ally don't know what to say.
F	LAURA	That was beautiful, honey. Well let me walk them to the car. Ingrid walks over.
F	INGRID	Don't be sad. Ira told us that his medicine is working and he's not sick anymore.
F	MABLE	I think that was a secret. I don't think you were supposed to say that.
M	CLARKE	Mable, take Ingrid into the house.
F	MABLE	Can we watch another SpongeBob movie? Atlantis.Squarepantis?
M	CLARKE	Yes. Go into the house and watch a movie now! Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house. What the fuck is going on around here? Is that true?
F	LAURA	I never said that he was still sick. He just took some medicine and it's looking better. You can't detect it in his blood, but it could come back.
M	CLARKE	Is it looking better? Or is he better? Is he sick anymore?
M	IRA	Well ...I don't how you define these things-I'm not... sure.
M	CLARKE	is something going on here? Are you getting your revenge on me while I'm away? I came clean with you, you can't come clean with me.
F	LAURA	You know what? I don't know what I want now.
M	IRA	Oh shit. It's ON.
M	CLARKE	So this is what you want? Was he ever sick in the first place?
M	IRA	He was sick. He was very sick.
M	CLARKE	Because if this is what you want, I'll leave right now. I'm not going to play these games. I'm happy to leave. I'm not gonnna have you put me on the cross because I made some mistakes. You guys enjoy each other. I could give a fuck. If you need me, I'll be at my apartment in China. Clarke leaves.
M	IRA	What the fuck is going on? Did you guys do something?
F	GEORGE	We had sex in Clarke's office.
M	IRA	Why?
F	GEORGE	Because I love her. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
M	IRA	But she has two kids, she's married.
F	GEORGE	She's miserable. He cheated on her.
M	IRA	You cheated on her.
F	GEORGE	Yeah, but that was a long time ago. I've changed. You saw that douche bag. You don't think he's fucking geishas on every business trip?
M	IRA	He was trying to cure you with herbs. He seems like a great guy.
F	GEORGE	This is none of your fucking business. Just stay out of it.
M	IRA	I can't stay out of it. We took your car here. I have no way of leaving.
F	GEORGE	This shit is deeper than you understand. People get divorced. People make mistakes and then they fix them. That's how life works. It's not a big deal. I know you're still sad because your parents got divorced. Well get the fuck over it. Call a fucking cab and go home.
M	IRA	So what are we gonna do?
F	GEORGE	You're gonna sleep in Clarke's office. I'm gonna go talk to Laura.
F	GEORGE	On, there you are. I've been looking for you.
F	LAURA	I've been going through all the bank statements, trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in mine. Almost all the accounts are in his name. I wonder if he did that on purpose.
F	GEORGE	Are you smoking a joint?
F	LAURA	Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows this stuff on a hill by her house. You want some?
F	GEORGE	No, that stuff makes me paranoid.
F	LAURA	Not me. It makes me feel sharper, Some people get tired, I get more energy, more clear.
F	GEORGE	What's happening?
F	LAURA	What's happening? Whatever we want to happen is gonna happen now. I'm free. I'm fucking free. Laura gets up, kisses him.
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	We're free. Yeah, we're free. They start kissing again. She starts to moan loudly.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Not so loud, your kids are sleeping.
F	LAURA	A tank could roll through this place, it wouldn't wake them up. They kiss some more. She moans louder.
M	DAISY (V.0.)	Hello?
M	IRA	Hey, Daisy. It's Ira.
M	DAISY (V.0.)	Oh. Ira. What's going on?
M	IRA	I just wanted to talk to you because I'm in the middle of a terrible situation and I don't have anyone I can talk about it with. My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his mind.
M	DAISY (V.0.)	You can tell me, what is it?
M	IRA	Look, I know you think I have the moral code of some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm with George and he's hitting on his ex-girlfriend who's married now and has kids and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of freaking out. I think I'm having a panic attack.
M	DAISY (V.0.)	Well don't have a panic attack, that's not going to help anything.
M	IRA	Well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it.
M	DAISY (V.0.)	
M	IRA	Haha, very funny.
M	DAISY (V.0.)	Seriously, what's going on?
M	IRA	Well I guess they dated like ten years ago... Ira and Daisy begin to have a bonding conversation. Jesus Christ, what time is it already?
M	IRA	It's 10:15 in the morning.
F	GEORGE	Oh my god. Really? I mean, this is fun, but I don't know how much I can take. Hopefully they'll take a nap at some point. I want to take a nap.
M	IRA	They don't look that tired. The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight
F	MABLE	Look what I did. I want this hung up on the wall. She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate
M	MABLE (CONT'D)	The food here made me sick.
F	INGRID	Mama, I have to go to the bathroom. Come wipe my butt.
F	LAURA	I have to talk to them for a minute. Mable, go wipe your sister's butt.
F	MABLE	She can do it. She's almost six. That's weird. Ingrid and Mable walk off together.
M	IRA	I wet the bed til I was eleven. It wasn't even a mental thing. I just got relaxed when I was asleep.
F	LAURA	I spoke to Clarke. He's going to fly back to China tonight. I was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting him there and telling him that when he comes back, he should find another place to live.
F	GEORGE	That's great. Are you okay doing that?
F	LAURA	Yes. It's what I want. I just need to figure out when we would move down to LA. It might be better to let the kids finish out the school year because I have to apply to the private schools in LA, and I don't know if I missed the deadline. Then I'd have to look into the charter schools. Sometimes these private schools, if you give them a donation, they let your kids in. Maybe you can stay up here for part of the year if I can't make it happen.
F	GEORGE	Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie, or on tour or something, that would be great. Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly
F	MABLE	I made her wipe her own butt.
F	INGRID	I did it, but I don't know if I did a good job. Look at what I drew. I drew a picture of you. Look? Show Mama. George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.
M	INGRID (CONT'D)	That's you. That's George. That's Mommy. And Daddy. And me. And Mable. That's all of us. We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands.
F	GEORGE	This is a small bookstore. They've only got one Philip Roth book. Didn't he write like fifty books?
M	IRA	So when are we going to go home? You're not talking at all about when we're going to go home.
F	GEORGE	She's going to talk to Clarke tonight, and then she's going to make a plan. We've got to get over that hurdle.
M	IRA	Are you okay with everything? This is happening pretty fast.
F	GEORGE	This is exactly what I wanted.
M	IRA	Okay.
F	GEORGE	I mean, she's cool, right?
M	IRA	She's nice. I don't really know her very well.
F	GEORGE	She was kind of cooler when I knew her back in the day. She's still hot, but she was crazy hot back then. Her attitude has changed a bit. With the kids and all. Back then she was really sexy, and all about fucking. I know she's busy with her life now, but it is a little different.
M	IRA	Yeah, well when you have two kids and a husband, and horses and ducks, it's not all about fucking. That's just the hormones of youth. I'm all about fucking. But I don't expect to be when I get older. I'll be occasionally about fucking, which is normal. The fact that you're all about fucking now is the weird thing.
F	GEORGE	Well hopefully everything will work out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be.
M	IRA	What does that mean?
F	GEORGE	It means I'm going to give it a shot. I'm excited, but I'm not going to really know if it works until we're in it. I hope I'm just not in love with the person she used to be.
M	IRA	She's about to leave her husband for good. She has two kids. You're not sure this is going to work?
F	GEORGE	There's no way to ever be sure that anything's going to work! I couldn't live up here. She wants me to live up here. I don't think I can do it. Maybe a couple of weeks a year.
M	IRA	Well, she'll live with you.
F	GEORGE	Do you think she means that she's going to bring the kids too?
M	IRA	Of course. What else would she do?
F	GEORGE	I don't know, don't some men get custody of the kids? Or they split the custody? I like the kids, but I've never lived with kids before.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	The young one's kind of cute, but I don't think I can stand the old one full time. There's too much going on there. But I could definitely tolerate the young one. She's cute. Maybe they can split kids. Maybe Clarke will take the annoying one. Ira just stares at him, not sure what to do.
F	LAURA	I'll be back in an hour and a half, tops. And then it all begins.
F	GEORGE	Okay, call me if you need any backup.
F	LAURA	I love you.
F	GEORGE	I.. . love you. The car drives off.
F	GEORGE	Okay, I'm going to go into the other room and watch some TV.
M	IRA	You don't want to hang with the kids?
F	GEORGE	Nah, I was going to watch four hockey games at once. I've never done that.
M	IRA	okay, but I've got to run out and grab some cigarettes.
F	GEORGE	But you don't smoke.
M	IRA	I never smoked in front of you because you were sick. But I do.
M	IRA	Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the fucking airport around here? Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in
M	INGRID (O.S.)	George! Help! George jumps up and runs to her. She is in the bathroom
M	INGRID (CONT'D)	Can you wipe my butt?
F	GEORGE	Don't you know how to do it?
F	INGRID	I don't do it good. Okay. Ira yells to someone on the street.
M	IRA	How do you get to the fucking airport?!
F	GEORGE	Where are you, where are you? You have to come back here. I need your help. I don't know how to do this. He walks back to where the kids are. They are watching tv.
F	MABLE	I think my mom and dad are getting a divorce. I don't want my parents to get divorced. All my friends' parents are divorced, and they're not happy.
F	GEORGE	Why would you say that?
F	MABLE	I heard my mom talking to her friend. I listened through the wall. She was looking for a lawyer. He cheated on her. What does cheating mean? That he's going to marry someone else? Why don't they just try harder?
F	GEORGE	Laura, it's George. Come back to the house. Maybe you shouldn't do it. Maybe it's too early for this. Call the house.
M	GEORGE (V.0.)	Where are you?
M	IRA	I'm getting cigarettes.
M	GEORGE (V.0.)	You've been gone for forty minutes.
M	IRA	I got lost. I don't know this town. Well come back. I don't know how to take care of these kids, I'm not a camp counselor like you. These kids are on to me. The older one's too intense. She's troubled. She's like Damien, from the Omen. I need help.
M	IRA	Ok, I'll hurry back.
M	CLARKS	I'm so sorry. This only happened because of me. It's all my fault. I made you feel terrible. I made you feel unsafe in our relationship. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Ira stands there, staring at them.
F	LAURA	I'm sorry too. I love you so much. It was just a flirtation. It never went anywhere. It's just after you cheated on me, I felt so alone. And you were gone so often that I felt like our life doesn't work.
M	CLARKE	Then I have to make a change. I'll stop most of the traveling. There's nothing more important than you and the kids. Ira starts to turn to sneak away. Clarke sees him.
M	CLARKE (CONT'D)	Ira! What's going on? What are you doing here?
M	IRA	Oh, I'm just headed back to Los Angeles. I've got some spots at the Improv I've got to do this weekend.
F	LAURA	Oh, fuck.
M	CLARKE	You're headed back to Los Angeles? Then why are you at the International terminal?
M	IRA	This is the International terminal? I'm so confused, I've never been to this airport before.
M	CLARKE	Yeah, this is the Air China First Class Lounge. REVEAL that everyone else in the lounge is Chinese.
M	CLARKE (COIN' D )	What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on, Laura?
F	LAURA	I don't know what to say.
M	CLARKE	Tel- me the truth ! Just tell me the tri.t_h.;_
F	LAURA	I came here to tell you that I wanted you to move out when you came home. But I realized this was a mistake, so I didn't say it. Please don't hold that against me. We've worked everything out. Everything is fine.
M	CLARKE	Who's watching the kids? Who's watching the fucking kids?
M	IRA	An adult is watching them.
M	CLARKE	Is George watching our fucking kids? I will kill him. Clarke runs off.
M	IRA	What the hell happened?
F	LAURA	Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my life! You and George have to get the fuck out of my life. You are ruining everything!
M	IRA	Uh oh. Ira runs out of the lounge. Laura runs out also.
M	IRA	No, no, no! I'm here. I'm here.
M	IRA	George! Clarke is coming back to the house. He knows everything! I'm coming to get you. Be at the end of the driveway. No! Be at the next driveway over! To the north!
M	CLARKE	Can you take it into the family fun room?
F	MABLE	Are you two going to fight?
M	CLARKE	Ye s.
F	GEORGE	She's not happy. Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts
M	CLARKE	No one who's married is fucking happy. Leave us alone! You fucked up. You fucked it up with her a long time ago. Let it go or I will kill you. I will literally kill you till you're fucking dead. That disease didn't kill you. But I will kill you.
F	GEORGE	You shouldn't joke about my disease. That was very serious. Very scary. Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	What the hell is that? Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Don't jump in. Whatever you do, don't jump in. I don't want your help!
M	IRA	Okay.
F	GEORGE	You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her. What kind of friend are you?
M	IRA	I am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy. You are out of control.
F	GEORGE	I didn't deserve what you did to me. You betrayed me !
M	IRA	When I got there, she was already kissing him. I never even had a chance to stop it. I didn't get to do anything!
M	CLARKE	Don't pretend you're fucking mad at each other, just to distract me so I won't beat your ass. Clarke pushes George.
M	CLARKE (CONT'D)	You're gonna come to my house? You're gonna come to my fucking house? You have to get your own life. Leave us the fuck alone.
F	GEORGE	Don't hit me! I've been sick! They don't know. The medicine is working now, but I'm still sick. Clarke punches George.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	What are you doing? I said to jump in!
M	IRA	You told me not to jump in.
F	GEORGE	That's what "don't jump in" means. It means "jump in." Help me! Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	You're a terrible fighter.
M	IRA	I know, that's why I became a comedian, because everyone used to beat me up! George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard,
F	GEORGE	Laura, tell Clarke to stop!
F	LAURA	Clarke, please don't do this.
M	CLARKE	Don't tell me what I can and can not do.
F	GEORGE	Laura, tell him. Tell him you want to be with me now. Laura doesn't answer.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Laura?
F	LAURA	Why did you have to come here and confuse me? Everything was fine before you came here. Now everything is all screwed up.
F	GEORGE	Laura, what's it going to be? Are you going with him, or are you going with me? Laura looks at Clarke.
F	LAURA	With him.
F	GEORGE	Don't do this.
F	LAURA	You fucked up my life. And now I fucked up yours. But just a little. Probably just for a day. She walks back into the house.
M	CLARKE	Hit the road before I put you through another round.
F	GEORGE	You cheated on her too!
M	CLARKE	Yeah, but we're married. We're going to work through this shit. You should have waited until you were married to cheat. It buys you another chance. Clarke punches George. Ira is on the ground. He doesn't get
F	GEORGE	She told me I was the love of her life. And she loves me more than she loves you!
M	CLARKE	When she said that, did she think you were dying?
F	GEORGE	Yeah!
M	CLARKE	Too bad you had to 'Live and find out it wasn't true. Leave my fucking family alone! Clarke punches him. George gets a punch in but it doesn't I can do this all night. Clarke hits George again. Ira leaps on Clarke and now all
F	GEORGE	Stop Ira, you're hitting me too. Mable and Ingrid appear outside.
F	MABLE	What are you guys doing?
F	INGRID	What's happening? The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful.
M	IRA	We're just playing that's all.
F	GEORGE	We're wrestling. It's fun.
M	CLARKS	Boys like to wrestle just like girls. They all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake A little blood runs off of George's face.
F	INGRID	Are you bleeding?
F	GEORGE	No. We were just painting. I got some paint on my cheek.
M	CLARKE	Come on girls. Let's go inside. Mable and Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.
M	CLARKE (CONT'D)	You know what sucks about this? I like your movies and now I can't watch them anymore. Clarke walks away, then walks back.
M	CLARKE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. That was mean. Through ail of this, I want you to know something. I'm glad that you're not sick, and I understand. And I forgive you. Clarke goes inside.
M	IRA	That was meaner than him punching you. That is a demented motherfucker. George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches
F	GEORGE	None of you fuckers can hurt me. George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the
M	IRA	Get the hell off of me you psycho.
F	GEORGE	Drive me home.
M	IRA	No.
F	GEORGE	How are you gonna get home then?
M	IRA	Fine.
M	IRA	You are the most self involved person I have ever met.
F	GEORGE	Oh yeah?
M	IRA	No matter what the situation, no matter how many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy. You're always going to be miserable. You are a bottomless pit. A bottomless wound.
F	GEORGE	What about you? You are just a lackey. Who are you to judge me? You tried to screw me over, after all I. have done for you.
M	IRA	I am not responsible for you. You wanted me to sit back and destroy this woman's life? Help you cheat on her? You put me in a terrible position. I don't give a fuck, go fuck yourself.
F	GEORGE	Lacky.
M	IRA	You made me the tacky? I'm not a lacky, it's a job.
F	GEORGE	It's not a job, you're a tacky. You're not even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad.
M	IRA	Who cares? If being funny means being like you, I rather be a little less funny.
F	GEORGE	Mission accomplished.
M	IRA	You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die.
F	GEORGE	I'm not going anywhere!
M	IRA	Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything!
F	GEORGE	Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door.
M	IRA	Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a huge mistake.
F	GEORGE	Wake me when we get home. George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed.
M	IRA	okay, I'm getting out. You have to drive yourself home. I'm getting out here.
F	GEORGE	Why didn't you drive me to my house?
M	IRA	Because then I'd still have your car.
F	GEORGE	You'll drop it off later.
M	IRA	There is no later! I'm not going to ever talk to you again. So I don't want your car.
F	GEORGE	So that's how it's going to be. George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV
M	ANCHORWOMAN (ON TV)	You know, when you've got a big family, and you've got a lot of clutter...
M	LEO	We rented out your room to Jay. But you can crash on the couch if you want.
M	IRA	Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch.
M	JONAH	I fucking didn't cum on the couch. Just sleep on it for a month, and then we'll find some excuse to boot Jay out.
M	IRA	Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way for a while. The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like.
M	I HA	That was great. She kisses him.
F	DAISY	Thanks. The MANAGER walks over.
M	MANAGER	Hey Ira, Federman got in a car accident. Do you want to take his spot? George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age.
F	GEORGE	Hey, how's it going?
M	IRA	Hey George.
F	GEORGE	This is Randy. He's funny, you'd like his stuff. It's smart.
M	IRA	I'm sure I would. I look forward to seeing it. Are you going on tonight?
M	RANDY	I hope so.
M	MANAGER	Do you want to go up? Ira was gonna take Federman's spot, but we can get you up if you want to?
F	GEORGE	No, that's ok. I don't want to take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna hang out tonight. On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not
M	ANGLE ON GEORGE	He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not
M	FEMALE CUSTOMER	Is the potato salad fresh?
M	IRA	I made it myself this morning.
M	FEMALE CUSTOMER	Is it good?
M	IRA	I stake my reputation on it.
M	FEMALE CUSTOMER	Okay. Give me a quart.
M	IRA	Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad. The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal
F	GEORGE	Do you have any turkey that's hormone-free?
M	IRA	Yes we do.
F	GEORGE	So this is where you work.
M	IRA	Back in the saddle.
F	GEORGE	I thought we were writing a screenplay.
M	IRA	Well, you're not a very good writing partner.
F	GEORGE	Or any kind of partner. You want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me? They give you breaks around here?
F	GEORGE	In my travels, I have learned a lot about Asia and Buddhism. And I would like to be in the moment now with you, and to tell you how sorry I am, and how much I have appreciated your friendship. And even if we are not friends in the future, I wish you well on your journey. Ira laughs.
M	IRA	That guy was a douche-bag.
F	GEORGE	But also kind of cool. It's a very weird combination.
M	IRA	He was going to heal you with those herbs, man. You get sick again, you should call that guy.
F	GEORGE	I think most of what you said to me was true. And I really am sorry. I think I'm still not very healthy...in my brain.
M	IRA	It's all right, man. You've been through a lot.
F	GEORGE	Well, I appreciate you trying to help me. Even though it was kind of an impossible task.
M	IRA	Is everything going okay? How are you doing?
F	GEORGE	I am not doing well, but things have certainly been worse. So, I will be fine. You were good the other night. I hear you're getting regular spots now.
M	IRA	I'm actually going up tonight.
F	GEORGE	Really? Any new jokes you're working on?
M	IRA	Yeah, I've been trying to get off my ass and do some writing.
F	GEORGE	What do you got? Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never
M	IRA	I was thinking about doing a bit about how I'm not very good looking, but I'm not bad looking, but I'm just good-looking enough that if I had a good personality, it might put me over the top.
F	GEORGE	You should do something about how, when you date a girl, and you feel really good and she likes you, and then you see pictures of all her ex- boyfriends, and they're all really goofy-looking guys, and it's not that you're good looking, it's just that in this psychotic girl's eyes, you're good looking?
M	IRA	And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou Costello.
F	GEORGE	Why don't you say Dom Deluise? it's a more current reference.
M	IRA	More current? What year was Cannonball Run, 1978?
F	GEORGE	Okay, okay. What else you got?
M	IRA	I was going to talk about how I haven't had sex in so long, that I can't even remember my previous sexual experiences so I can masturbate to them.
F	GEORGE	You should say, now when I masturbate, I have to think about the last time I masturbated.
M	IRA	That's a good one. You can write.
F	GEORGE	You know, I always wanted to be part of the comedy field. As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes
