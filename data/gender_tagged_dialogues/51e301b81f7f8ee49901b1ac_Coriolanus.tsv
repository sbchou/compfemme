M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CASSIUS	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak -- You are all resolved rather to die than to famish? The others agree. They are not wild-eyed radicals. They are
M	CASSIUS	First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people. A voice from the back of the room:
M	TAMORA	Let us kill him. The others turn. Tamora, just entering, pulls off her coat,
M	TAMORA	And we'll have corn at our own price. Is it a verdict? Some are unsure. She is too extreme for some. We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our sufferance, is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our sticks ere we become rakes! I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge. A woman, a YOUNG MOTHER, protests:
M	YOUNG MOTHER	Will you proceed especially against Caius Martius?
M	CASSIUS	Against him first. A COLLEGE PROFESSOR, speaks up:
M	COLLEGE PROFESSOR	Consider you what services he has done for his country? Very well, and could be content to give him good report for it -- but that he pays himself with being proud.
M	COLLEGE PROFESSOR	Nay, but speak not maliciously. She has over-played her hand. Pretends to back down:
M	TAMORA	I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end... He did it to please his mother. Some laugh at her gossip. Then the TV image switches to a BREAKING NEWS update:
M	CASSIUS	Soft, who comes here?
M	COLLEGE PROFESSOR	Worthy Senator Menenius, one that hath always loved the people.
M	TAMORA	He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so. Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbors, Will you undo yourselves? I tell you, friends, most charitable care Have the patricians of you, For your wants, Your suffering in this dearth, you may as
M	WELL	Strike at the heavens with your staves as
M	LIFT THEM	Against the Roman state--
M	TAMORA	Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain-- The others shush her. Alack, you are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you; and you
M	SLANDER	The helms of the state, who care for you like fathers, When you curse them as enemies-- Cassius mutes the TV. We see Senator Menenius continuing with
M	CASSIUS	Care for us? They never cared for us yet!
M	TAMORA	If the wars eat us not up, they will: and that's all the love they bear us. The others are growing increasingly restive -- shifting --
M	CASSIUS	Why stay we prating here?
M	TAMORA	No more talking on it! To the Capitol! Come! Come! They round a corner and suddenly stop-- For a formidable sight awaits them-
M	RIOT POLICE.	Rows of black uniforms. Full riot gear with plexiglass A few soldiers on horses as well. The crowd starts and shifts nervously, unsure how to proceed. military force? A long, tense beat. Then... One of the horsemen trots forward... He rides a beautiful white horse... It is CAIUS MARTIUS. (Soon to be given the honorary title His gaze is ice... A long beat... Then he dismounts... He slowly walks to the unruly mob... With no hesitation, unarmed... He stops before them... And speaks with absolute disdain.
M	MARTIUS	What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, Make yourselves scabs? We have ever your good word. He that will give good words to thee will
M	FLATTER	Beneath abhorring. The crowd is hushed. Taking in his every word. We note a TV news crew has moved into position and is filming
M	MARTIUS	What would you have, you curs? He that trusts to you, Where he should find you lions, finds you
M	HARES;	Where foxes, geese. He walks along the front of the crowd. Some are frightened by
M	MARTIUS	Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate... Hang ye! Trust ye? With every minute you do change your mind, And call him noble that was now your hate, Him vile that was your garland. He continues along the crowd, his cold eyes taking in face
M	MARTIUS	What's the matter, That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble Senate, who, Under the gods, keep you in awe, which
M	ELSE	Would feed on one another? He stops and glares at the mob with seething anger.
M	MARTIUS	Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS! A tense beat. The riot police shift nervously. The crowd is unsure. The TV news crew films everything. Cassius looks around. He sees the police ready with tear gas. He exchanges a few whispers works with Tamora. Word is passed The danger has passed. Senator Menenius, who has been watching from nearby, gestures
M	MENENIUS	These are almost thoroughly persuaded; For though abundantly they lack discretion, Yet are they passing cowardly.
M	MARTIUS	They are dissolved. Hang 'em. Senator Menenius watches the crowd. Disturbed.
M	MENENIUS	I would they were abed.
M	MARTIUS	I would they were in Tiber. They move off. Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS! Tullus Aufidius is leaning in. Watching so closely. He runs his knife blade back and forth. Turns it in the Then Aufidius leans back again. Back into the shadows. Disappearing. COMINIUS, an older general, enters. He is an experienced
M	COMINIUS	The news is the Volsces are in arms.
M	COMINIUS	They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to it.
M	MARTIUS	I sin in envying his nobility, And were I any thing but what I am, I would wish me only he.
M	SENATOR	You have fought together?
M	MARTIUS	He is a lion That I am proud to hunt. Martius takes the remote control. Stops the video. Rewinds to
M	MARTIUS	Titus Lartius, thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
M	TITUS	Lead you on. Martius rewinds and plays the image of Aufidius again, Aufidius appears to be staring right back at Martius...
M	The same face.	Aufidius, who is the leader of the rebel Volscian forces, The Volsces are an insurgent force challenging the monolithic We are in the Volsce war room in an old apartment building. A OFFICERS and some civilian POLITICIANS. The room is filled
M	VOLSCE POLITICIAN	So, your opinion is, Aufidius, That they of Rome are entered in our And know how we proceed. Is it not yours? Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
M	VOLSCE OFFICER	We never yet made doubt but Rome was
M	READY	To answer us.
M	VOLSCE POLITICIAN	And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads in their preparation. He tosses a glossy magazine on the desk, a picture of Martius Aufidius' eyes spark at the image of Martius.
M	AUFIDIUS	If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever
M	STRIKE	Till one can do no more. By the elements, If ever again I meet him beard to beard, He's mine or I am his. It floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the This fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away In the immaculate front gardens YOUNG MARTIUS, Martius' son, Young Martius chases after the butterfly, trying to catch it. Finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly. In She sees Young Martius stop and look at the tiny bit of blood She turns away. Virgilia was well-chosen for her role as wife to one of The room is spacious and elegantly appointed. A lovely Roman A fine flat-screen TV flickers with images of war. We see Virgilia moves from the window. Sits on a sofa. She watches
F	VOLUMNIA	I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. She moves across the room to fetch a cigarette. She moves, She walks past a series of photographs. They tell the story In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to
F	VOLUMNIA	When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. She lights her cigarette.
F	VOLUMNIA	To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
F	VIRGILIA	But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
F	VOLUMNIA	Then his good report should have been my son. Had I a dozen sons I had rather have eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
M	MAID	Madam, Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
F	VOLUMNIA	Tell Menenius we are fit to bid him welcome. The Maid goes.
F	VIRGILIA	Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
F	VOLUMNIA	Indeed, you shall not! She turns off the TV and goes to a bar to mix drinks. She
F	VOLUMNIA	Methinks I hear hither your husband's
M	DRUM;	Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call
M	VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)	"Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear, Though you were born in Rome." His bloody

F	VIRGILIA	His bloody brow? 0 Jupiter, no blood...
F	VOLUMNIA	Away, you fool! It more becomes a man Than gold his trophy.
F	VIRGILIA	Heavens bless my lord from fell Auf idius ...
F	VOLUMNIA	He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee And tread upon his neck. Senator Menenius enters, he is comfortable in this house and
M	MENENIUS	My ladies both, good day to you. Volumnia hands him one of the drinks she has been mixing: a
M	MENENIUS	How do you both? And how does your little son?
F	VIRGILIA	I thank you, sir; well, good.
F	VOLUMNIA	He had rather play with swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.
M	MENENIUS	On my word, the father's son! He and Volumnia laugh. Menenius has sensed Virgilia's tension. Tries to cheer her:
M	MENENIUS	Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
F	VIRGILIA	No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
M	MENENIUS	Not out of doors!
F	VOLUMNIA	She shall, she shall.
F	VIRGILIA	Indeed, no, by your patience. I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
M	MENENIUS	Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
F	VIRGILIA	I cannot go hither. You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
F	VIRGILIA	No, good sir, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
M	MENENIUS	Go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
F	VIRGILIA	0, good sir, there can be none yet.
M	MENENIUS	There came news from him last night. Volumnia pounces, moving in:
F	VOLUMNIA	Indeed?
M	MENENIUS	Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true, on mine honor; and so, I pray, go out with us. Give me excuse, good sir. I will obey you in everything hereafter. Let her alone. As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth. She takes Menenius arm and pulls him out, eager for more news Virgilia sits for a beat. Then she presses a button on the remote control. The TV goes Virgilia watches the war footage, her eyes haunted. We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is The Roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body Martius calls over the incessant din of battle to Titus and
M	MARTIUS	They fear us not, but issue forth their city. Sniper bullets slam into a wall near him. He coughs away the
M	MARTIUS	They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, Which makes me sweat with wrath! He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce, And he shall feel mine edge! Martius leaps up and races on. The others follow in military The Roman soldiers move along the street -- it is chaotic -- Finally the Romans turn a corner and are stopped by a He goes to the window. Scans the street below. Sees Martius Martius refuses to yield -- pushing and shoving his men

M	PALE	With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home, Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave An EXPLOSION -- dirt and brick shards slash across Martius' This only pushes his fury to white rage--

He doesn't even realize he From Martius' POV: We move through disorienting curtains of smoke... Firing a heavy machine gun... Volscian soldiers contort and die, torn to pieces by the The heavy machine gun is empty, we drop it and use a sidearm, Volscian soldiers dart up -- fire -- and die... Shadowy shapes moving nearby, we fire. Killing civilians. The Strange surreal images. We smash into a house. An OLD MAN Panicked civilians, scattering in terror... We continue forward... Then the pistol is empty, we drop it and pull a machete-like Still moving relentlessly forward... Slashing and killing... Hand-to-hand now... Carnage. Roman fire stops them-- They return fire as they divert down another alley, trying
M	TITUS	What is become of Martius?
M	SOLDIER 1	Slain, sir, doubtless.
M	SOLDIER 2	He is himself alone, To answer all the city.
M	TITUS	Thou art lost, Martius... Titus has no time to mourn. He looks over the hopeless He glimpses a ghostly figure...
M	TITUS	Who's yonder, That does appear as he were flayed? 0 gods! He has the stamp of Martius. It is indeed Martius. A shocking sight. Drenched head-to-toe in blood. His face splattered with gore. His eyes wild. Lost in something like rapture.
M	MARTIUS	Come I too late?! Come I too late?!
M	TITUS	Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, But mantled in your own. Martius laughs wildly and embraces Titus, who comes away
M	MARTIUS	0, let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I wooed, in
M	HEART	As merry as when our nuptial day was done! SUDDENLY -- a deafening explosion -- and RPG EXPLODING from The Romans instantly begin diving for cover and taking up Martius scans the location. Sees the attack is coming from an Martius stops scanning with his binoculars--
M	MARTIUS	There is the man of my soul's hate-- Piercing our Romans.
M	TITUS	Worthy sir, thou bleeds. Thy exercise hath been too violent For a second course of fight.
M	MARTIUS	Sir, praise me not. My work hath yet not warmed me. The blood I drop is more medicinal Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight. He turns to some soldiers, imploring them to join him. His If any such be here- As it were sin to doubt - that love this

M	HIMSELF;	Let him alone, or so many so minded, Wave thus, to express his disposition, The soldiers are pumped up -- like Marines straining for Zigzagging across the plaza toward the hotel--
M	PLAZA--	They return fire at the hotel as best they can, but the
M	THEY GO--	Then Martius is hit-- But still he keeps on-- The front of the hotel is closer now-- It is the weird and incongruous nature of modern urban It is brutal-- Martius and his soldiers cut a bloody swath across the hotel Another HUGE EXPLOSION rocks the hotel -- like a seismic Martius and his men move into a stairwell-- Bullets ricochet crazily in the confined stairway, refracting Then Martius slows to a stop. Looks up. Aufidius is on the stairway above. Glaring down at him.
M	MARTIUS	I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
M	AUFIDIUS	We hate alike. Then Martius does something astounding. He holds out his arms to his sides and drops his weapons. Aufidius does the same. The Roman and Volscian soldiers watch. None daring to interfere. Martius and Aufidius continue to glare at each other -- They slam together- Fighting without weapons-- Grappling brutally. Tearing at each other. Twining together. They crash and slam awkwardly in the claustrophobic Another EXPLOSION rocks the hotel-- Part of the roof COLLAPSES-- Concrete SLAMS down-- A cloud of smoke, dust and debris obscures everything- But Aufidius and his comrades disappear into a cloud of dust. Martius glares after him. Wipes blood from his eyes. The moaning and screaming of the injured are constant. Roman General Cominius enters with several attending officers,
M	COMINIUS	If I should tell thee over this thy day's work, Thou would not believe thy deeds. Martius is barely listening. His attention is on a YOUNG
M	COMINIUS	But I'll report it Where Senators shall mingle tears with Where great patricians shall attend and shrug, In the end admire and say: "We thank the
M	GODS	Our Rome hath such a soldier." Pray now, no more. My mother, When she does praise me, grieves me. I have done as you have done - that's what I can; Induced as you have been - that's for my country. Martius continues to look at the poor dying soldier.
M	TITUS	Rome must know The value of her own. It were a
M	CONCEALMENT	Worse than a theft, To hide your doings.
M	MARTIUS	I have some wounds upon me, and they
M	SMART	To hear themselves remembered. The surgeon finishes stitching Martius' arm. Starts to clean
M	COMINIUS	Should they not, Well might they fester against
M	INGRATITUDE	Too modest are you. Impatient, Martius rises, painfully and slowly. He takes his Martius watches as... The Young Soldier dies. The light goes from his eyes. His I will go wash; And when my face is fair, you shall
M	PERCEIVE	Whether I blush or no Howbeit, thank you. Martius stares at the dead soldier. They are moving through the outskirts of Corioles, leaving They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father, Roman atrocities. Aufidius gazes at the bodies. His face hardens.
M	AUFIDIUS	Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me, And would do so, I think, should we
M	ENCOUNTER	As often as we eat. He becomes aware some of his men are looking at him,
M	FOR WHERE	I thought to crush him in an equal force, True sword to sword, I'll stab him some way, Or wrath -- or craft -- may get him.
M	SOLDIER	He's the devil.
M	AUFIDIUS	Bolder, though not so subtle. A beat. Aufidius continues with prayer-like intensity:
M	AUFIDIUS	My valor, poisoned with him, Shall fly out of itself ... Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, Sick, the prayers of priests, Nor times of sacrifice, Shall lift up their rotten privilege And custom, Against my hate to Martius. In the shattered glass of the minivan window, Aufidius He studies his own face, nurturing his dark thoughts.
M	AUFIDIUS	Where I find him, were it At home, upon my brother's guard, even there, Will I wash my fierce hand in his heart. Comfortable red leather booths. Wooden panelling. BRUTUS is a large man in a rumpled grey suit; a sweating bear Both are ambitious politicos used to manipulating the people
M	SICINIUS	Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?
M	CASSIUS	He has no equal.
M	SICINIUS	When we were chosen Tribunes for the
M	BRUTUS	Marked you his lip and eyes?
M	SICINIUS	Nay, but his taunts. They see Senator Menenius approaching. Sicinius nods to Menenius stops by on his way out. He is jolly, knowing the
M	MENENIUS	The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
M	BRUTUS	Good or bad?
M	MENENIUS	Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
M	SICINIUS	Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
M	MENENIUS	You blame Martius for being proud?
M	BRUTUS	We do it not alone, sir. Subtly, the polite chit-chat is turning more serious and
M	MENENIUS	I know you can do very little alone You talk of pride: 0 that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! 0 that you could!
M	BRUTUS	What then, sir?
M	MENENIUS	Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
M	SICINIUS	Menenius, you are known well enough too.
M	MENENIUS	I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
M	BRUTUS	Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
M	MENENIUS	You know neither me, yourselves nor anything You are ambitious. A tense beat. They are formidable adversaries.
M	MENENIUS	Good-e'en to your worships. More of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you. He goes. The Tribunes watch him cut through the lunch crowd
F	VOLUMNIA	Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches! For the love of Juno, let's go.
M	MENENIUS	Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.
F	VIRGILIA	0, no, no, no... 0, he is wounded! I thank the gods for it.
M	MENENIUS	So do I too -- if it be not too much. Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him. Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
F	VOLUMNIA	Titus Lartius says they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
F	VIRGILIA	In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. Gods grant them true.
F	VOLUMNIA	True?!
M	MENENIUS	I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds
F	VOLUMNIA	In the shoulder and in the left arm. There will be large scars to show the people, when he shall stand for his place He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts in the body.
M	MENENIUS	One in the neck, and two in the thigh - there's nine that I know.
F	VOLUMNIA	He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.
M	MENENIUS	Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an enemy's grave. We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.
M	BEFORE HIM	He carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears. Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die. They hurry to the stop of a grand staircase, where there are An honor guard of Roman soldiers in dress uniforms are Volumnia looks down on him. Unmoved by his pain. As Coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps,
M	COMINIUS	Be it known, As to us, to all the world, that Caius
M	MARTIUS	Wears this war's garland And from this time, For what he did before Corioles, call him, With all the applause and clamor of the host, "Caius Martius Coriolanus!" Bear the addition nobly ever! The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant:
M	SOLDIERS	Caius Martius Coriolanus! Coriolanus has reached the podium. An awkward beat. Cominius
M	CORIOLANUS	No more of this; it does offend my heart. Pray now, no more. An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers the
M	COMINIUS	Look, sir, your mother. You have, I know, petitioned all the gods For my prosperity. He kneels to her -- slowly, with great difficulty -- she lets
F	VOLUMNIA	Nay, my good soldier, up. My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and By deed-achieving honor newly named - What is it? - Coriolanus must I call thee? She laughs coquettishly, thoroughly upstaging her son.
F	VOLUMNIA	But, 0, thy wife... Coriolanus greets Virgilia with the clumsy and stiff
M	CORIOLANUS	My gracious silence, hail. An awkwardly tender kiss. He notes her tears. Reacts coldly.
M	CORIOLANUS	Would thou have laughed had I come coffined home, That weeps to see me triumph? Ay, my dear, Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, And mothers that lack sons.
M	MENENIUS	Now, the gods crown thee!
M	CORIOLANUS	And live you yet? I know not where to turn. 0, welcome home! And welcome, general. And you're welcome all!
M	MENENIUS	A hundred thousand welcomes! Coriolanus is surrounded by well-wishers and political
M	And then the hard reality.	Coriolanus' body is a battleground of scars. Some are livid His body is something monstrous. Stitched up. Patched He is leaning against a sink, stripped naked. His muscular if Volumnia sits and dresses her son's wounds. As she always has It is a disturbing, intimate image.
M	CORIOLANUS	The good Senators must be visited; From whom I have received not only greetings, But with them change of honors. He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his
F	VOLUMNIA	I have lived To see inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy. Only There's one thing wanting, which I doubt
M	NOT BUT	Our Rome will cast upon thee. He catches her eye in the mirror, very firm:
M	CORIOLANUS	Know, good mother, I had rather be their servant in my way, Than sway with them in theirs. They stop when-- Virgilia enters. She stops in the doorway. It is embarrassing for her, as if She looks to her husband. To Volumnia. They stare back. There is no way she can compete with their intimacy. She stops and opens a door, glances into her son's bedroom: Her eyes move across his room. The military toys. The little
M	SICINIUS	He cannot temperately transport his honors, but will Lose those he hath won.
M	BRUTUS	I heard him swear, Were he to stand for Consul, never would
M	HE	Appear in the marketplace nor Showing, as the manner is, his wounds To the people, beg "their stinking breaths."
M	SICINIUS	It was his word.
M	BRUTUS	So it must fall out with him, Or our authorities at an end.
M	SICINIUS	We must suggest to the people in what
M	HATRED	He still hath held them. Peace... They enter the Senate Chamber...
M	MENENIUS (V.0.)	It remains, As the main point of this our after- meeting, To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country... The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner. Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:
M	MENENIUS	Therefore, please you, Most reverend and grave elders, to desire The present Consul, and last general In our well-found successes, to report A little of that worthy work performed By Caius Martius Coriolanus.
M	SENATOR	Speak, good Cominius. General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.
M	MENENIUS	Nay, keep your place.
M	SENATOR	Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear What you have nobly done.
M	CORIOLANUS	Your honors' pardon. I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them.
M	MENENIUS	Pray now, sit down.
M	CORIOLANUS	I had rather have one scratch my head in
M	THE SUN	When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered. Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway. Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius. Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech
M	COMINIUS	The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly. It is held That valor is the chiefest virtue, and Most dignifies the haver. Alone he
M	ENTERED	The mortal gate of the city, And struck Corioles like a planet, From face to foot He was a thing of blood... Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the political He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts. Coriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant. He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re-
M	MENENIUS	The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased To make thee Consul! Menenius steps back. A beat. Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras.
M	CORIOLANUS	I do owe them still My life and services. A beat. For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to
M	MENENIUS	It then remains That you do speak to the people.
M	CORIOLANUS	I do beseech you, Let me overleap that custom, for I cannot
M	ENTREAT THEM	For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you that I may pass this doing. From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this:
M	SICINIUS	Sir, the people Must have their voices! The Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement.
M	MENENIUS	Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
M	CORIOLANUS	It is a part That I shall blush in acting, and might
M	WELL	Be taken from the people. Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone. Mark you that?
M	CORIOLANUS	To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!" Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only! Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out
M	MENENIUS	To our noble Consul Wish we all joy and honor! He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so She sits, watching the events unfold on TV. Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and
M	MENENIUS	Have you not known The worthiest men have done it? Custom calls me to it. What custom wills, in all things should we do... What must I say? "Look, sir, my wounds. I got them in my country's service."
M	MENENIUS	O me, the gods! You must not speak like that. You must
M	DESIRE THEM	To think upon you--
M	CORIOLANUS	"Think upon me"? Hang 'em! I would they would forget me.
M	MENENIUS	You'll mar all! The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:
M	MENENIUS	Pray you, speak to them, I pray you, In wholesome manner. Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean. He leaves the car. But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square -- Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He Waiting for something to happen. The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.
M	CASSIUS	We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you to it.
M	CORIOLANUS	Mine own desert.
M	TAMORA	Your own desert?
M	CORIOLANUS	Ay, but not mine own desire.
M	TAMORA	How not your own desire?
M	CORIOLANUS	No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
M	CASSIUS	You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
M	CORIOLANUS	Well then, I pray, your price of the Consulship?
M	WAR VET	The price is to ask it kindly.
M	CORIOLANUS	Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private Your good voice, sir. What say you? You shall have it, worthy sir.
M	CORIOLANUS	A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu. Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on.
M	CASSIUS	But this is something odd. Coriolanus continues on. He sees a large JAMAICAN WOMAN with
M	CORIOLANUS	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be Consul.
M	JAMAICAN WOMAN	You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.
M	CORIOLANUS	Your enigma?
M	JAMAICAN WOMAN	You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people.
M	CORIOLANUS	You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love Therefore, beseech you, I may be Consul.
M	SHOPKEEPER	We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
M	JAMAICAN WOMAN	You have received many wounds for your country.
M	CORIOLANUS	I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.
M	JAMAICAN WOMAN	The gods give you joy, sir, heartily! Coriolanus is warming to the task, it's easier than he
M	CORIOLANUS	Your voices! For your voices I have
M	FOUGHT;	Watched for your voices; for your voices
M	BEAR	Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice
M	SIX	I have seen and heard of! A crowd is gathering. We note Brutus and Sicinius in the
M	CORIOLANUS	For your voices Have done many things, some less, some more. Your voices! Indeed, I would be Consul.
M	WAR VET	He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
M	RACE TRACK TOUT	Therefore let him be Consul!
M	JAMAICAN WOMAN	The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people! The Citizens applaud and give their support:
M	CITIZENS	Amen, amen. God save thee, noble Consul!
M	CORIOLANUS	Worthy voices! Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius, goes to him:
M	MENENIUS	You have stood your limitation, and the
M	TRIBUNES	Endue you with the people's voice.
M	CORIOLANUS	Is this done?
M	SICINIUS	The custom of request you have discharged. The people do admit you, and are summoned To meet anon upon your approbation.
M	CORIOLANUS	Where? At the Senate?
M	SICINIUS	There, Coriolanus.
M	MENENIUS	I'll keep you company. Will you along? We stay here for the people. Coriolanus and Menenius go, relieved the trial is over.
M	SICINIUS	How now, my masters! Have you chose this man? He has our voices, sir.
M	BRUTUS	We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
M	TAMORA	Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice, He mocked us when he begged our voices.
M	CERTAINLY	He flouted us downright.
M	JAMAICAN WOMAN	No, it is his kind of speech; he did not mock us. He should have showed us His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
M	SICINIUS	Why, so he did, I am sure.
M	TAMORA	No, no! No one saw them!
M	CASSIUS	Was not this mockery? Brutus presses hard:
M	BRUTUS	When he had no power, But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against Your liberties.
M	SICINIUS	Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves, and do you
M	THINK	That his contempt shall not be bruising
M	TO YOU	When he hath power to crush? Cassius and Tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing
M	CASSIUS	He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet!
M	TAMORA	And will deny him! I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
M	CASSIUS	I twice five hundred and their friends! The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound.
M	SICINIUS	Let them assemble, And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election.
M	BRUTUS	Enforce his pride, And his old hate unto you!
M	SICINIUS	And presently, when you have drawn your number, Repair to the Capitol.
M	CASSIUS	We will so!
M	TAMORA	We will so! All Repent in their election! Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
M	TITUS	He has, my lord.
M	CORIOLANUS	Saw you Aufidius?
M	TITUS	He is retired to Antium.
M	CORIOLANUS	Spoke he of me?
M	TITUS	He did, my lord.
M	CORIOLANUS	How? What?
M	TITUS	How often he had met you, sword to sword; That of all things upon the earth he
M	HATED	Your person most.
M	CORIOLANUS	At Antium lives he?
M	TITUS	At Antium.
M	CORIOLANUS	I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully. They hear the growing rumble of a crowd. Curious. Behold, these are the Tribunes of the people, The tongues of the common mouth.
M	SICINIUS	Pass no further.
M	CORIOLANUS	Ha! What is that?
M	BRUTUS	It will be dangerous to go on. No further.
M	CORIOLANUS	What makes this change?
M	MENENIUS	The matter?
M	COMINIUS	Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
M	BRUTUS	Cominius, no. Coriolanus steps closer to Brutus. The mob sees him through
M	CORIOLANUS	Have I had children's voices?
M	TITUS	Tribunes, give way.
M	BRUTUS	The people are incensed against him.
M	CORIOLANUS	Are these your herd?
M	MENENIUS	Be calm, be calm.
M	BRUTUS	The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
M	CORIOLANUS	But this was known before.
M	SICINIUS	You show too much of that For which the people stir. If you will
M	PASS	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way. The crowd outside is growing restless, sensing and responding
M	MENENIUS	Let's be calm--
M	COMINIUS	The people are abused, set on--
M	MENENIUS	Not now, not now--
M	TITUS	Not in this heat, sir-- Coriolanus strides angrily toward the doors and exits--
M	CORIOLANUS	My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For the mutable, rank-scented crowd, Let them regard me as I do not flatter, And therein behold themselves. I say again, In soothing them, we nourish against our
M	SENATE	The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, Which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered, By mingling them with us!
M	MENENIUS	Well, no more!
M	TITUS	No more words, we beseech you-- The mob has surrounded them all by now. The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from This all has the potential of sparking to violence.
M	BRUTUS	You speak of the people As if you were a god to punish, not A man of their infirmity.
M	SICINIUS	It were well we let the people know it.
M	CORIOLANUS	Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove, it would be my mind!
M	SICINIUS	It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is, Not poison any further. "Shall remain"! Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark
M	YOU	His absolute "shall"?
M	BRUTUS	Why, should the people give One that speaks thus their voice?
M	CORIOLANUS	I'll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices! Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and
M	CORIOLANUS	By Jove himself, It makes the consuls base; and my soul
M	ACHES	To know, when two authorities are up, Neither supreme, how soon confusion, May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other. The crowd roars angrily -- Coriolanus spins on them:
M	CORIOLANUS	Thus we debase the nature of our seats, and make the rabble Call our cares fears; which will in time Break ope the locks of the Senate, and
M	BRING IN	The crows to peck the eagles!
M	MENENIUS	Come, enough!
M	BRUTUS	Enough, with over-measure.
M	SICINIUS	He has spoken like a traitor, and shall
M	ANSWER	As traitors do! At the word "traitor" Coriolanus loses all reason, he is
M	CORIOLANUS	Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
M	BRUTUS	Manifest treason!
M	SICINIUS	This is a Consul? No!
M	CORIOLANUS	Hence, old goat! Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside-- Menenius pulls Coriolanus off:
M	MENENIUS	On both sides more respect!
M	SICINIUS	Here's he that would take from you all your power! The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is
M	BRUTUS	You are at point to lose your liberties! Martius would have all from you, Martius, Whom late you have named for Consul.
M	SICINIUS	What is the city but the people?!
M	TAMORA	True! The people are the city!
M	SICINIUS	We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people, Martius is worthy of present DEATH!
M	BRUTUS	Guards, seize him!
M	CORIOLANUS	No, I'll die here!
M	BRUTUS	Lay hands upon him!
M	SICINIUS	At his cue-- The civil violence threatened from the opening moments of With Cassius and Tamora in the forefront, the crowd attacks Riot Police march in, slamming ahead with riot shields and The mob fights back with anything at hand -- some are armed
M	MENENIUS	Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away! All will be naught else--
M	COMINIUS	Come, sir, along with us-- They hurry Coriolanus away-- The Riot Police, outnumbered, start firing TEAR GAS into the TV news crew filming-- Chaotic, flurried violence-- Shaky TV images, cell phone video-- Choking, acrid gas-- It is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order Rome is bloody. Tamora, her face bloody from the riot, is with them. So too As I do know the Consul's worthiness, So can I name his faults--
M	SICINIUS	Consul! What Consul?
M	MENENIUS	The Consul Coriolanus.
M	BRUTUS	He Consul?!
M	SICINIUS	It is decreed He dies tonight.
M	TAMORA	He's a disease that must be cut away.
M	MENENIUS	0, he's a limb that has but a disease: Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. What has he done to Rome that's worth his death? Eh? Killing our enemies?! He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses the
M	MENENIUS	The blood he hath lost -- He dropped it for his country. Some in the room murmur agreement.
M	BRUTUS	We'll hear no more--
M	MENENIUS	Consider this: he has been bred in the
M	WARS	Since he could draw a sword, and is ill
M	SCHOOLED	In graceful language Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring
M	HIM	Where he shall answer by a lawful form, In peace, to his utmost peril.
M	PRO-CORIOLANUS SENATOR	Noble tribunes, It is the humane way.
M	ANOTHER SENATOR	The other course Will prove too bloody, and the end of it Unknown to the beginning. Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him.
M	BRUTUS	Be you then as the people's officer. Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved.
M	BRUTUS	If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed In our first way.
M	MENENIUS	I'll bring him to you. He goes quickly. Brutus turns to Sicinius and Tamora and begins to quietly
M	CORIOLANUS	Let them pull all about mine ears,
M	PRESENT ME	Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, Yet will I still be thus to them--! I muse my mother Does not approve me further! He slams through a door to the living room...
M	CORIOLANUS	I talk of you! Why did you wish me milder? Would you
M	HAVE ME	False to my nature? Rather say I play The man I am! She is equally tough with him, not giving an inch, snapping
F	VOLUMNIA	0, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out.
M	CORIOLANUS	Let go!
F	VOLUMNIA	You might have been enough the man you are, With striving less to be so!
M	CORIOLANUS	Let them hang!
F	VOLUMNIA	Av, and burn too! Her outraged fury matches his. Overpowers his. Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough. You must return and mend it. Coriolanus turns away.
F	VOLUMNIA	Pray, be counseled. I have a heart as little apt as yours, But yet a brain that leads my use of
M	ANGER	To better vantage.
M	MENENIUS	Well said, noble woman!
M	CORIOLANUS	What must I do?
M	MENENIUS	Return to the Tribunes.
M	CORIOLANUS	Well, what then? What then?
M	MENENIUS	Repent what you have spoke.
M	CORIOLANUS	For them? I cannot do it to the gods. Must I then do it to them?
F	VOLUMNIA	You are too absolute, Though therein you can never be too noble.
M	CORIOLANUS	Why force you this? She pursues him:
F	VOLUMNIA	Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people, not by your own instruction, Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, But with such words that are but
M	REHEARSED IN	Your tongue, though but bastards and
M	SYLLABLES	Of no allowance to your bosom's truth... She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of
F	VOLUMNIA	I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake I should do so in honor... She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently,
F	VOLUMNIA	I am in this your wife, your son, These senators, the nobles And you. A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web.
F	VOLUMNIA	I prithee now, my son, Go and say to them Thou art their soldier, and being bred in
M	BROILS	Has not the soft way In asking their good loves; but thou wilt
M	FRAME	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
M	MENENIUS	This but done, even as she speaks, Why their hearts were yours.
F	VOLUMNIA	Prithee now, Go, and be ruled... Although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower. Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them.
M	COMINIUS	Sir, it is fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence. All's in anger.
M	MENENIUS	Only fair speech.
M	COMINIUS	I think it will serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit.
F	VOLUMNIA	He must -- and will. Prithee now, say you will, and go about it. With base tongue give my noble heart A lie that it must bear? . Well, I will do it. But he is still agitated. Volumnia shares a concerned glance Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit. A beggar's tongue Make motion through my lips, and my armed knees, Who bowed but in my stirrup, bend like
M	HIS	That hath charity received! The thought of begging is too much, he rejects it, breaking
M	CORIOLANUS	I will not do it! Lest I cease to honor mine own truth And by my body's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness. Volumnia snarls at him, exasperated, building to a thunder
F	VOLUMNIA	At thy choice, then! To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor Than thou of them. Come all to ruin! Let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than
M	FEAR	Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at
M	DEATH	With as biq heart as thou! Do as you like! The words echo. It is as if he has been slapped. His resolve vanishes.
M	CORIOLANUS	Pray, be content... Mother, I am going, chide me no more. He awaits her approval. She will not yet grant it.
M	CORIOLANUS	Look, I am going... Commend me to my wife. I'll return Consul, Or never trust to what my tongue can do In the way of flattery further. She graciously bows to him.
F	VOLUMNIA	Do your will. Then she kisses him. And she goes. Like a queen. Volumnia triumphant. Always. Then a shocking hard cut to: In this point charge him home: that he
M	AFFECTS	Tyrannical power. If he evade us there, Enforce him with his envy to the people. Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll?
M	TAMORA	I have; it's ready.
M	SICINIUS	When the people hear me say "It shall be
M	SO	In the right and strength of the Commons," be it either For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them, If I say "Fine," cry "Fine!" - if "Death," cry "Death!"
M	TAMORA	We shall inform them. Cassius and Tamora hurry off to instruct and manipulate the A gloomy but resolved Coriolanus walks with Cominius and
M	ARM YOURSELF	To answer mildly, for they are prepared With accusations, as I hear, more strong Than are upon you yet.
M	CORIOLANUS	The word is "mildly." Pray you, let us go. Let them accuse me by invention, I Will answer in mine honor.
M	MENENIUS	Ay, but mildly.
M	CORIOLANUS	Well, mildly be it then. Mildly! Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd, Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end.
M	BRUTUS	Put him to choler straight. Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus
M	MENENIUS	Calmly, I do beseech you. Coriolanus steps to the microphone. Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down. When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make a
M	CORIOLANUS	The honored gods-- But his voice echoes badly with reverb. Menenius adjusts the
M	CORIOLANUS	The honored gods Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of
M	JUSTICE	Supplied with worthy men. Plant love among us. Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, And not our streets with war.
M	COMINIUS	Amen, amen.
M	MENENIUS	A noble wish. His boilerplate speech over, Coriolanus turns to Sicinius who
M	CORIOLANUS	Shall I be charged no further than this present? Must all determine here?
M	SICINIUS	I do demand, If you submit you to the people's voices.
M	CORIOLANUS	I am content.
M	MENENIUS	Lo, citizens, he says he is content. The warlike service he has done,
M	CONSIDER; THINK	Upon the wounds his body bears, which
M	SHOW	Like graves in the holy churchyard.
M	CORIOLANUS	Scratches with briers, Scars to move laughter only.
M	MENENIUS	Consider further, That when he speaks not like a citizen, You find him like a soldier. Do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds, But, as I say, such as become a soldier.
M	CORIOLANUS	What is the matter That being passed for Consul with full voice, I am so dishonored that the very hour You take it off again?
M	SICINIUS	We charge you that you have contrived to
M	TAKE	From Rome all seasoned office, and to
M	WIND	Yourself into a power tyrannical
M	SICINIUS (CONT'D)	For which you are a traitor to the people. Coriolanus responds, a cobra striking:
M	CORIOLANUS	How? Traitor?! Nay, temperately! Your promise.
M	CORIOLANUS	The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people! Call me their traitor, thou injurious Tribune! Mark you this, people?! The crowd responds, egged on by Cassius and Tamora. A murmur traitor..." Brutus cleverly plays the reasonable voice, knowing his words
M	BRUTUS	But since he hath Served well for Rome-- What do you prate of service?
M	BRUTUS	I talk of that, that know it.
M	CORIOLANUS	You?! I'll know no further. Let them pronounce death, exile, Flaying, pent to linger But with a grain a day - I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word!
M	SICINIUS	In the name of the people And in the power of us the Tribunes, we, Even from this instant, banish him our city! In the people's name, I say IT SHALL BE SO! Well-rehearsed by Cassius and Tamora, many in the crowd
M	CROWD	It shall be so! It shall be so! Let him away!
M	TAMORA	He's banished! IT SHALL BE SO!
M	CROWD	It shall be so! It shall be so! It shall be so...! Cassius and Tamora keep the crowd at a fever pitch-- A building seismic rumble-- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends--!
M	SICINIUS	He's sentenced. No more hearing.
M	COMINIUS	Let me speak! The crowd's fury is building-- It is all about to erupt--
M	BRUTUS	There's no more to be said, but he is
M	BANISHED	As enemy to the people and his country.
M	CROWD	It shall be so! It shall be so! It shall be so...! His rage is volcanic-- He SLAMS the standing microphone away-- A collective intake of breath-- The crowd is stunned--
M	CORIOLANUS	Whose breath I hate As reek of the rotten fens, whose loves I
M	PRIZE	As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air... The crowd is silent. No one dares to even breathe.
M	CORIOLANUS	Here remain with your uncertainty. Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts! Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, Fan you into despair! Have the power
M	STILL	To banish your defenders, till at length Your ignorance - which finds not till it feels,
M	CORIOLANUS (CANT'D)	Making but reservation of yourselves; Still your own foes - deliver you As most abated captives to some nation That won you without blows! A beat. The TV cameras hum. The crowd is silent.
M	CORIOLANUS	Despising, For you, the city, thus I turn my back. He turns and slowly walks toward one of the tunnels leading The crowd follows every step with their eyes. Turns back. Steel.
M	CORIOLANUS	There is a world elsewhere. And he goes down the tunnel. Disappearing from view. A silent beat. Then, a chilling cry of absolutely Jacobin bloodlust from the
M	TAMORA	The people's enemy is gone! The crowd SCREAMS their approval. The SAVAGE CRY echoes around the studio. There is a lonely gas station in the distance, its neon sign Several cars pull up to the checkpoint. Two Roman security Security Guards climb out of their vehicle, light cigarettes Come, leave your tears. A brief farewell.
M	THE BEAST	With many heads butts me away. Volumnia has tears in her eyes as well. Coriolanus is
M	CORIOLANUS	Nay, mother, Where is your ancient courage?
F	VOLUMNIA	Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, And occupations perish!
M	CORIOLANUS	Nay, mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked. She nods to him, she has regained her composure. Only then do they climb from the car. Bid me farewell.
M	TITUS	Farewell, Martius. Cominius, droop not, adieu. I'll do well yet. He goes to Menenius, who is genuinely distraught. For all his
M	CORIOLANUS	Thou old and true Menenius, Thy tears are salter than a younger man's, And venomous to thine eyes. If I could shake off but seven years I'd go with thee every foot. They embrace. Then Coriolanus knows it is time to go. He picks up a A beat. A certain darkness creeps into his expression. An ominous
M	CORIOLANUS	You shall hear from me still. He turns and looks to the distance. Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation. His future.
M	CORIOLANUS	I go alone, Like to a lonely dragon. He strides off. The soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier. The only sound is the cold, lonely moan of the wind.
M	Coriolanus' exile.	We see his long odyssey. It is a grueling physical journey -- We see him as... He walks along the barren highway. Trash piled along the A gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes Then descending. Pouring rain. Lightning sparking. He is We end at... His destination since he began. The home of his nemesis, the He begins to walk to the town. They see Volumnia entering the restaurant, pulling Virgilia
M	BRUTUS	Here comes his mother.
M	SICINIUS	Let's not meet her. They say she's mad. Volumnia stalks up to them:
F	VOLUMNIA	0, you're well met. The hoarded plague of
M	THE GODS	Requite your love! The Tribunes try to leave, she won't let them:
F	VOLUMNIA	Will you be gone?
F	VIRGILIA	You shall stay too. I would I had the
M	POWER	To say so to my husband.
M	SICINIUS	Are you mad?
F	VOLUMNIA	Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this, Hadst thou craft To banish him that struck more blows for
M	ROME	Than thou hast spoken words?
M	SICINIUS	0 blessed heavens... Volumnia is creating a scene. Heads are turning.
F	VOLUMNIA	More noble blows than ever thou wise words, And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what - Nay -- but thou shalt stay too -- I would
M	MY SON	Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, His good sword in his hand.
M	SICINIUS	What then?
F	VIRGILIA	What then? He'd make an end of thy posterity.
F	VOLUMNIA	Bastards and all. Menenius has entered the bar, seeing the trouble he goes to
M	MENENIUS	Come, come, peace...
M	BRUTUS	Pray, let us go. He tries to leave the bar. Volumnia stops him for final
F	VOLUMNIA	Now, pray, sir, get you gone. You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, This lady's husband here, this, do you see?!-- Whom you have banished, does exceed you all.
M	BRUTUS	Well, well, we'll leave you.
M	SICINIUS	Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits?
F	VOLUMNIA	I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses! Menenius gently restrains Volumnia and the Tribunes finally Volumnia takes a breath, controls herself.
F	VOLUMNIA	Could I meet 'em But once a day, it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to it.
M	MENENIUS	You have told them home; And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me? She turns to him. A cold and killing fire in her eyes.
F	VOLUMNIA	Anger's my meat. I sup upon myself, And so shall starve with feeding. She takes Virgilia's hand and drags her out. Once proud Volumnia, reduced to this. There is life to the place, a certain humid vitality. Someone Coriolanus, his face still shrouded in the burnoose, like a Coriolanus sees a heavily-guarded apartment building at the He stops. Steps into the shadows. For he sees... Walking with a few of his officers. Aufidius is beloved in Antium. He has an easy manner with the Coriolanus watches from the shadows, his expression complex. Coriolanus watches Aufidius and his men go into an apartment He scans the building with the eye of a Special Forces Two YOUNG WOMEN, perhaps hookers, move past the front of the Coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows The doorway is guarded by two serious GUARDS. These are not Coriolanus considers his course. Decides. Takes a breath. Focuses. He is like ice now. A steady stride-- He walks right up to the Guards-- Before they can even respond-- He punches one HARD in the throat -- the Guard recoils, Simultaneously, Coriolanus SLAMS his other hand violently And Coriolanus shoves the Guard into-- The soldiers bolt up, upsetting the table, smashing dishes -- As Coriolanus powers in, still holding the second Guard by
M	THE FACE--	He flings the Guard aside-- Aufidius and his men, all pointing weapons at Coriolanus, are A long beat. Coriolanus' face is still masked by the burnoose. Only his
M	AUFIDIUS	Whence comes thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name? Coriolanus does not respond. Aufidius is growing uneasy. His men are tense, ready to open
M	AUFIDIUS	Speak, man! What's thy name?
M	CORIOLANUS	A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, And harsh in sound to thine. The other Guard from outside, and several other soldiers, Aufidius, intrigued by the stranger's courage, waves his men
M	AUFIDIUS	Say, what's thy name? Thou has a grim appearance .What's thy name?
M	CORIOLANUS	Know'st thou me yet?
M	AUFIDIUS	I know thee not Thy name? Finally, Coriolanus removes his burnoose. His face is
M	CORIOLANUS	My name is Caius Martius, who hath done To thee particularly and to all the
M	VOLSCES	Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness
M	MAY	My surname Coriolanus. The Volscians look to Aufidius, very nervous, unsure how to
M	CORIOLANUS	Only that name remains. Aufidius doesn't understand. Coriolanus explains:
M	CORIOLANUS	The cruelty and envy of the people, Who have all forsook me, hath devoured the rest, And suffered me by the voice of slaves to Whooped out of Rome. Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of
M	HOPE -	Mistake me not - to save my life; for if I had feared death, of all the men in the
M	WORLD	I would have avoided thee, but in mere spite, To be full quit of those my banishers, Stand I before thee here. Coriolanus dares to take a step toward Aufidius-- Coriolanus carefully holds out his arms. He's unarmed.
M	CORIOLANUS	I will fight Against my cankered country with the
M	SPLEEN	Of all the under fiends. But if thou Dares not this, then I present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice... Coriolanus stops right in front of Aufidius and slowly, Ready for execution.
M	CORIOLANUS	Which not to cut would show thee but a fool, Since I have ever followed thee with hate, And cannot live but to thy shame unless It be to do thee service. A long beat. Aufidius stares at Coriolanus. The Volscians watch, eyes wide, too tense to do anything now. Aufidius just continues to stare at Coriolanus. Coriolanus blinks some sweat from his eyes. This tiny, human
M	AUFIDIUS	O Martius Martius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy. He offers his hand. Coriolanus takes it. Aufidius continues to hold him by the
M	AUFIDIUS	Let me twine Mine arms about that body. He embraces Coriolanus. Aufidius' men finally relax. Weapons are lowered. Relieved Some of the Volscians, though, are clearly suspicious of
M	KNOW THOU	I loved the maid I married; never man Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee here, Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt
M	HEART	Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold. Coriolanus glances to him, perhaps a little disturbed or
M	AUFIDIUS	Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, We have a power on foot, and I had
M	PURPOSE	Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, Or lose mine arm for it. Thou hast beat
M	ME OUT	Twelve several times, and I have nightly
M	SINCE	Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me. Aufidius continues quietly, almost whispering:
M	AUFIDIUS	Worthy Martius, Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that Thou art thence banished, we would muster
M	ALL	From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, Like a bold flood, overbear it. An old woman is using an electric razor to shave his head. A pause. Then Aufidius goes to the old woman. Takes the razor from Aufidius continues to shave Coriolanus' head himself. Aufidius ushers Coriolanus in:
M	AUFIDIUS	0, come, go in, And take our friendly senators by the hands. Coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians:
M	CORIOLANUS	You bless me, gods. Then Aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a
M	AUFIDIUS	Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou
M	WILT HAVE	The leading of thine own revenges, take The one half of my commission. The Volscian soldiers and politicos are shocked. Aufidius is
M	AUFIDIUS	And set down--- As best thou art experienced, since thou
M	KNOWS	Thy country's strength and weakness--- thine own ways, Whether to knock against the gates of Rome, Or rudely visit them in parts remote, To fright them ere destroy. Aufidius looks at Coriolanus hard. There it is. The gauntlet
M	BRUTUS	Is this Menenius?
M	SICINIUS	'Tis he,'tis he! 0, he is grown most kind of late. Hail sir!
M	MENENIUS	Hail to you both.
M	YOUR CORIOLANUS	Is not much missed, but with his friends.
M	MENENIUS	All's well, and might have been much
M	BETTER IF	He could have temporized.
M	SICINIUS	Where is he, hear you?
M	MENENIUS	Nay, I hear nothing. His mother and his
M	WIFE	Hear nothing from him.
M	BRUTUS	Caius Martius was A worthy officer in the war, but insolent, Overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
M	MENENIUS	I think not so.
M	SICINIUS	And Rome sits safe and still without him. They are distracted when people begin talking loudly, Reports the Volsces with two several
M	POWERS	Are entered in the Roman territories, And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before them... The whole bar is growing quiet now. All watching the TV,
M	MENENIUS	'Tis Aufidius, Who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, Thrusts forth his horns again into the world. Come, what talk you of Martius?
M	BRUTUS	It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us. The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the Senate House. Some news is
M	COMING	That turns their countenances... Yes, the first report is seconded, and more, More fearful, is delivered. The TV picture switches to a flustered TV REPORTER outside It is spoke freely out of many mouths - How probable I do not know - that Martius Has ioined with Aufidius-- There is an audible gasp in the bar -- quickly silenced and --He leads a power against Rome, And vows revenge as spacious as between The youngest and oldest thing. Something close to terror on the faces of the politicos. He does not want to believe this is possible. On the TV an imbedded WAR CORRESPONDENT is giving an update, A fearful army, led by Caius Martius Associated with Aufidius, rages Upon our territories, and have already Overborne their way, consumed with fire,
M	AND TOOK	What lay before them. Her son, to her the model of all Roman virtues, has betrayed Martius has joined with the Volscians - He is their god. He leads them like Boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing flies. Close up on Volumnia's face. She gives away practically nothing. She takes a slow drag on her cigarette. Soldiers are cleaning weapons, cooking meals, sleeping, Then... An incongruous sight... An old barber chair floats past. Moving across the blue sky. It is like something from LORD OF THE FLIES. The CAMP BARBER, a fat man in a greasy butcher's apron, Hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved. There is no sign of Coriolanus himself.
M	AUFIDIUS	Do they still fly to Coriolanus?
M	LIEUTENANT	I do not know what witchcraft's in him,
M	BUT	Your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, Their talk at table, and their thanks at end. And you are darkened in this action, sir.
M	AUFIDIUS	He bears himself more proud, Even to my person, than I thought he
M	WOULD	When first I did embrace him. They turn and walk to the building where Aufidius is
M	LIEUTENANT	Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome? I think he'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish, who takes
M	IT	By sovereignty of nature. Aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters Aufidius sits on his cot, deep in thought. We realize it is the glossy magazine cover with the picture
M	AUFIDIUS	Whether t'was pride, Whether defect of judgement, Or whether nature, Not to be other than one thing, Made him feared, So hated, and so banished. A beat as he studies the picture. His lieutenant watches him closely, disturbed by Aufidius'
M	AUFIDIUS	So our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time. He brings the picture closer, whispering now:
M	AUFIDIUS	One fire drives out one fire; one nail,
M	ONE NAIL;	Rights by rights founder, strengths by strengths do fail And when, Caius, Rome is thine, Thou art poorest of all -- then shortly art thou mine. Menenius stands with the two Tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius.
M	MENENIUS	No, I'll not go!
M	MENENIUS	Go, you that banished him! A mile before his tent fall down, and
M	KNEE	The way into his mercy. They stop when Titus enters with General Cominius. Menenius and the others crowd around him, waiting for his Titus sits, takes a moment to pull himself together, and then
M	TITUS	He would not seem to know me. A beat.
M	TITUS	I urged our old acquaintance, and the
M	DROPS	That we have bled together. "Coriolanus" He would not answer to, forbade all names... A long beat. They wait for him to go on. Titus searches for the words to continue.
M	TITUS	He was a kind of nothing. Titleless... Till he had forged himself a name in the
M	FIRE	Of burning Rome. He has no more to say, his head drops.
M	SICINIUS	If you refuse your aid Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, More than the instant army we can make, Might stop our countryman.
M	MENENIUS	No, I'll not meddle.
M	SICINIUS	Pray you, go to him.
M	MENENIUS	What should I do? Brutus stops him, with real emotion:
M	BRUTUS	Only make trial what your love can do For Rome towards Martius.
M	MENENIUS	Well, and say that Martius Return me, as Titus is returned, Unheard - what then?
M	SICINIUS	Yet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome. Menenius thinks about it.
M	BRUTUS	You know the very road into his kindness, And cannot lose your way. Menenius, despite all still a patriot at heart, decides.
M	MENENIUS	I'll undertake it I think he'll hear me. The Tribunes are relieved. Cominius nods and escorts Menenius Brutus and Sicinius return to Titus.
M	TITUS	He'll never hear him.
M	SICINIUS	No?
M	TITUS	I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye Red as it would burn Rome. He and General Cominius climb out. Menenius is out of place He walks down the highway toward the distant Volscian troops. We hear some of the soldiers hooting at him. We stay close on The Volscians drag him into the abandoned factory-- Coriolanus. Transformed. And terrifying. He is no longer Roman. He is not Volscian. He is, as Titus He sits in the barber chair. His head is completely shaved. He is primitive. Inhuman. Like a dragon. The Angel of Death. His young warrior Acolytes -- similarly shaved and painted -- Coriolanus just gazes back at him. Menenius finally pulls himself together and approaches, with
M	MENENIUS	The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does! 0 Martius, Martius! He steps forward to hug Coriolanus. Two of the Acolytes stop Menenius accepts this. No matter. He is completely confident
M	MENENIUS	Thou art preparing fire for us. Look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome. A long beat. Menenius waits for an answer. Grows uneasy. Then...
M	CORIOLANUS	Away.
M	MENENIUS	How? . Away? Wife mother child I know not.
M	MY AFFAIRS	Are servanted to others. Menenius can't believe this cold response--
M	CORIOLANUS	Therefore be gone. His frigid eyes slice into Menenius:
M	CORIOLANUS	Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak. Menenius stares at him, shaken to the core. Coriolanus doesn't even glance at him. General Cominius follows urgently, Menenius doesn't stop:
M	MENENIUS	This Martius is grown from man to dragon. He has wings; he's more than a creeping thing. He stops at his limo. A beat. He turns back to Cominius. We see the pain in Menenius' eyes.
M	MENENIUS	There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger. He climbs into his limo. Shuts the door. The rejection by Coriolanus has wounded him. Also he is This preys on him. Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks. He stops. He sits on the railroad tracks. Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion, He stares out over the hideous landscape. He slumps over. Menenius is dead. Coriolanus, still in the barber chair, broods silently. The visit from Menenius is troubling Coriolanus.
M	CORIOLANUS	My partner in this action, You must report to the Volscian lords how
M	PLAINLY	I have borne this business. Aufidius is curiously formal in his response, the
M	AUFIDIUS	Only their ends You have respected; stopped your ears
M	AGAINST	The general suit of Rome; never admitted A private whisper, no, not with such
M	FRIENDS	That thought them sure of you.
M	CORIOLANUS	This last old man, Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to Rome, Loved me above the measure of a father. Shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their Some of the soldiers whistle. Some spit. Others laugh and She is magnificent. He tries to register nothing, assuming a sort of glacial Volumnia and the others stop -- taking in Coriolanus' savage Volumnia just stands, peering sternly at her son. As if It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches:
F	VIRGILIA	My lord and husband-- He stop her, almost a warning, with:
M	CORIOLANUS	These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
F	VIRGILIA	The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so.
M	CORIOLANUS	Best of my flesh, Forgive my tyranny, but do not say For that "Forgive our Romans." She shows great courage. Stepping forward and kissing him
M	CORIOLANUS	0, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge. It is a perverse response. In his monomaniacal imagination, He finally moves to Volumnia, simply can't resist her orbital
M	CORIOLANUS	You gods I prate, And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, in the earth. He kneels before her. It is done with a sense of duty and
F	VOLUMNIA	0, stand up blest. He rises.
F	VOLUMNIA	Then with no softer cushion than the
M	FLINT	I kneel before thee. She quickly and dramatically kneels before him. It is a coup
M	CORIOLANUS	What is this? Your knees to me? To your corrected son?
F	VOLUMNIA	Thou art my warrior; I hope to frame thee. She indicates Young Martius:
F	VOLUMNIA	This is a poor epitome of yours, Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself.
M	CORIOLANUS	The god of soldiers, Inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may prove To shame invulnerable. Volumnia pulls Young Martius down:
F	VOLUMNIA	Your knee, sir. She pulls Virgilia down:
F	VOLUMNIA	Even he, your wife, and myself, Are suitors to you. All three kneel before Coriolanus. A pitiable sight. But he He turns, sits in the barber chair.
M	CORIOLANUS	I beseech you, peace! Or, if you'd ask, remember this: Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or
M	CAPITULATE	Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural. Desire not To ally my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons. Volumnia stands, assuming again a position of strength.
F	VOLUMNIA	0, no more, no more! You have said you will not grant us anything, For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already; yet we will ask, That, if you fail in our request, the
M	BLAME	May hang upon your hardness. Therefore hear us.
M	CORIOLANUS	Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for
M	WE'LL	Hear naught from Rome in private. Your request?
F	VOLUMNIA	Should we be silent and not speak, our
M	RAIMENT	And state of bodies would reveal what
M	LIFE	We have led since thy exile. Think with
M	THYSELF	How more unfortunate than all living
M	WOMEN	Are we come hither, since that thy sight,
M	WHICH SHOULD	Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow, Making the mother, wife, and child to see The son, the husband and the father
M	TEARING	His country's bowels out. Coriolanus' face is a study in aloof neutrality. Yet he is
F	VOLUMNIA	For myself, son, I propose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine. If I cannot
M	PERSUADE THEE	Rather to show a noble grace, thou shalt
M	NO SOONER	March to assault thy country than to Tread on thy mother's womb That brought thee to this world. Ay, and mine, That brought you forth this boy, to keep
M	YOUR NAME	Living to time. Young Martius stands as well and approaches his father,
M	YOUNG MARTIUS	You shall not tread on me. I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight! Coriolanus stares at him -- the intensity of the boy's
M	CORIOLANUS	I have sat too long. He rises and turns as if to go--
F	VOLUMNIA	Nay, go not from us thus! Her command stops him. She appeals, quickly getting to the
F	VOLUMNIA	If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you might
M	CONDEMN US	As poisonous of your honor. No, our suit Is that you reconcile them -- so the
M	VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)	May say "This mercy we have showed," the Romans, "This we received," and each in either
M	SIDE	Give the all-hail to thee and cry, "Be
M	BLEST	For making up this peace!" Coriolanus does not respond. She softens...
F	VOLUMNIA	Speak to me, son... Still he does not respond. His emotions are roiling. Still she is soft and vulnerable...
F	VOLUMNIA	Why dost not speak? But softness is not a note she plays naturally. She knows it.
F	VOLUMNIA	Thinks thou it honorable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you. He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy. Perhaps thy childishness will move him
M	MORE	Than can our reasons. There's no man in
M	THE WORLD	More bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate Like one in the stocks! She is assaulting him now, on the attack:
F	VOLUMNIA	Thou hast never in thy life Showed thy dear mother any courtesy, When she, poor hen, Has clucked thee to the wars and safely
M	HOME	Loaded with honor. Say my request's unjust, And spurn me back; and the gods will
M	VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)	plague thee, That thou restrains from me the duty
M	WHICH	To a mother's part belongs! Coriolanus can take no more, turns and begins to walk away--
F	VOLUMNIA	Down! Let us shame him with our knees! She claws at the dirt -- like Hecuba -- keening -- a shocking
F	VOLUMNIA	Down! An end! This is the last. So we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbors. Nay, behold! This boy, that cannot tell what he would
M	HAVE	But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship, Does reason our petition with more
M	STRENGTH	Than thou hast to deny it. She remains kneeling, panting for air. She looks back up at him. She senses she has failed.
F	VOLUMNIA	Come, let us go. She rises slowly, her age showing. Her spirit broken. Or She stares at Coriolanus as she rips off the Roman Eagle
F	VOLUMNIA	This fellow had a Volscian to his mother; His wife is in Corioles and his child Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch. I am hushed until our city be afire, And then I'll speak a little. She turns and begins to go. But... We see finally Coriolanus crack. Like a great building crumbling. Like fissures cutting across marble. Emotion floods into him. He lunges forward and grabs her hand. Volumnia stops. He doesn't speak.
M	CORIOLANUS	O mother mother... What have you done? He falls to his knees, clutching her hand.
M	CORIOLANUS	Behold, the heavens do ope, The gods look down -- and this unnatural
M	SCENE	They laugh at. He buries his head in her, like a lost child:
M	CORIOLANUS	O my mother, mother! 0! You have won a happy victory for Rome; But for your son - believe it, 0 believe it! - Most dangerously you have with him
M	PREVAILED	If not most mortal to him. She looks down at him. His meaning, his foreshadowing, is She is willing to pay that price. So is he. A moment between them. He accepts his destiny.
M	CORIOLANUS	But let it come. He stands, regains his composure. He slowly walks to He leans close, speaking intimately:
M	CORIOLANUS	Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you have
M	HEARD	A mother less? Or granted less? Aufidius? I was moved withal.
M	CORIOLANUS	I dare be sworn you were. And, sir, it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good
M	sir,	What peace you'll make, advise me. We study Aufidius' face. He gives away nothing. The crimson sky looms over her ominously. And we go to... It has the stiff formality of a White House ceremony.
M	COMINIUS	A merrier day did never yet greet Rome, No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins. We have all Great cause to give great thanks. He looks to Volumnia.
M	COMINIUS	Behold our patroness, the life of Rome. She is erect and exalted. "The Life of Rome" personified. Coriolanus will not look at her. Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to Aufidius is deep in thought. His Lieutenant breaks the silence:
M	LIEUTENANT	How is it with our general?
M	AUFIDIUS	As with a man by his own charity slain.
M	LIEUTENANT	Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all.
M	AUFIDIUS	I know it, And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction. A beat. He continues more to himself than them, almost
M	AUFIDIUS	I raised him, and I pawned Mine honor for his truth; who being so heightened, He watered his new plants with dews of flattery, Seducing so my friends. At the last I seemed his follower, not partner, and He waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
M	LIEUTENANT	So he did, my lord. The army marveled at it; and in the last, When he had carried Rome and that we
M	LOOKED	For no less spoil than glory-- Aufidius works himself into an intense, neurotic rage:
M	AUFIDIUS	There was it! For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him. At a few drops of women's rheum, which
M	ARE	As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and
M	LABOR	Of our great action -- Therefore shall he die, And I'll renew me in his fall.
M	LIEUTENANT	Therefore, at your vantage, Ere he express himself or move the people With what he would say, let him feel your sword, Which we will second. Say no more. In the distance they can see a Roman military truck They exchange a look. This is what they have been waiting He stops. He sees Aufidius and the thugs. Waiting for him. Like a death Coriolanus looks at them. He knows exactly what's going to happen. He is ready. He nods and the truck drives off. Coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop, like There is something new to Coriolanus here. A sort of Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a They meet in the parking lot. I am returned your soldier, No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence, but still
M	SUBSISTING	Under your great command. He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius:
M	CORIOLANUS	We have made peace With no less honor to the Volscians Than shame to the Romans.
M	AUFIDIUS	Read it not, But tell the traitor, in the highest
M	DEGREE	He hath abused your powers. Coriolanus is ready for Aufidius' ploy. He is amused at the
M	CORIOLANUS	Traitor? How now?
M	AUFIDIUS	Ay, traitor, Martius.
M	CORIOLANUS	"Martius"?
M	AUFIDIUS	Ay, Martius, Caius Martius! Dost thou
M	THINK	I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy
M	STOLEN NAME	"Coriolanus"? He spins to the others, making the case against Coriolanus He has betrayed your business and given up, For certain drops of salt, your city Rome- I say "your city" - to his wife and
M	MOTHER;	Breaking his oath and resolution, like A twist of rotten silk; never admitting Counsel of the war, but at his nurse's
M	TEARS	He whined and roared away YOUR VICTORY!
M	CORIOLANUS	Hear'st thou, Mars?
M	AUFIDIUS	Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
M	CORIOLANUS	Measureless liar, thou has made my heart Too great for what contains it. "Boy"? 0 slave. Coriolanus' eyes miss nothing a Volscian thug shifting Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous.
M	CORIOLANUS	Cut me to pieces, Volsces. Men and lads, stain all your edges on me. It is a dare. A challenge.
M	CORIOLANUS	"Boy"? False hound. If you have writ your annals true, 'tis
M	THERE	That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles. His gaze burns into Aufidius:
M	CORIOLANUS	Alone I did it "Boy."
M	AUFIDIUS	Let him die for it. At this command, his men move-- Aufidius steps back as-- The Volscian thugs attack-- With knives, machetes and tire irons-- Slashing and cutting his way through the killers- But the thugs overpower Coriolanus, there are just too many-- They stab him -- slicing with knives -- battering with chains Slaughter. But still he comes on. Body riddled with bullets and cut to Finally the thugs move away. Coriolanus still stands. Teetering. His face is a swollen What is left of Coriolanus glares at him through blood. Coriolanus looks at him. Then slowly Coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm He locks eyes with Aufidius. Aufidius steps to him. Takes his neck. Pulls him onto the Then Coriolanus falls. A pause.
M	AUFIDIUS	Take him up. No one moves.
M	AUFIDIUS	Assist. The footage from the cell phone video. Coriolanus' body in the back of the trunk.
M	The End.
