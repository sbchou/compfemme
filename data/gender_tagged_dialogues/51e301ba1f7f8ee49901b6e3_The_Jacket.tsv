M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.)	I remember there was so much white everywhere. And I felt peace...even though there was war around me. And I felt alive, even though I knew I was dead.
M	INTERN #1	Come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here. Starks, William. Born December 25, Wait, so how old? [Searching through records] Here he is. William Starks. Born in Vermont. He hasn't got a family listed. The naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him. Oh my God! This soldier is ALIVE! Code blue! CODE BLUE! This man just blinked!
M	INTERN #1	He's been tagged already. Worry about the others... [then seeing STARKS blink] Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We need a doctor! Get a doctor over here now!
M	CAPTAIN MEDLEY	The level of arms on the ground really depends. [Answering a question] But no, I'd have to say we haven't had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected.
M	NEWSANCHOR	Have you lost any men today, Captain?
M	CAPTAIN MEDLEY	No. One of my Corporals took a bullet to the head, but it looks like he might make it. Looks that way...
M	DOCTOR	Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A little more to the right and it wouldn't have wanted to come out...
M	MAJOR	But he's never gonna be able to remember what happened?
M	DOCTOR	It's hard to say. Sergeant Starks could have retrograde amnesia or... [lowering his voice] any form of psychological suppression. It's very common with traumas like this. Sergeant Starks is in the room, [beat] and I want to know when I'm going home.
M	LIEUTENANT	Sergeant, you have no surviving family in the States. I'm sure you have friends or distant relatives, but unfortunately we have no record of them yet.
M	MAJOR	Captain Medley has recommended you for the Purple Heart, Sergeant.
M	STARKS	Can I have one of those?
M	LIEUTENANT	Of course.
M	DOCTOR	There is help for you, Sergeant.
M	LIEUTENANT	Of course there is. Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette,
M	STARKS [V.O.]	I didn't know where my home was. I just knew I didn't want to be there anymore.
F	JACKIE	Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
M	STARKS	You two ok?
F	JACKIE	Our car won't start. What's your mom's name?
M	JACKIE [Cautiously]	Jean.
M	STARKS	Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need you to try to wake up, Jean.
M	STARKS	Your mom take anything before this happened?
F	JACKIE	Yeah, but I don't know what.
M	STARKS	[Beat] What's your name?
F	JACKIE	Jackie.
M	STARKS	Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while I take a look at your car.
M	STARKS	What do you think of all this snow?
F	JACKIE	[Beat] Nothing. But I like it I guess.
M	STARKS	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
F	JACKIE	Yeah.
M	STARKS	Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing it.
M	JACKIE [Smiling]	It works!
F	JEAN	Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
F	JACKIE	Mom, he just fixed our car. Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
F	JEAN	Look, I don't want any trouble, so...
M	STARKS	Neither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my way.
F	JACKIE	Mom, you've got it wrong...
F	JACKIE	You're just gonna walk?
M	STARKS	Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
F	JACKIE	What're those?
M	STARKS	Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
F	JACKIE	What for?
M	STARKS	[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. Hm.
M	STARKS	I think I can remember what's on them.
F	JACKIE	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks. "Jackie" and "Jean" are the only ...things you know for certain about that day? Are you aware we have no last name, no place of residence, and no record of any physical presence for these "friends" of yours? How's that possible in this day and age? I may need to actually hear that answer, Mr. Starks.
M	STARKS	[Beat] Yes. With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is
M	OFFICER NASH [Emotional]	Eddie [correcting himself], Officer Harrison, was lying in a pool of his own blood -- on his back.
M	DR. HALE	William Starks could be blocking the incident. It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother. A delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this.
M	OFFICER NASH [Cont'd]	Officer Harrison'd been shot three times. He was long dead by the time we got there.
M	DR. HALE	I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome. The medical community is only beginning to gather information about it.
M	PROSECUTION	Gulf War Syndrome? What the...Why don't we start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome while we're at it? I've gotten a lot of convictions we could overturn with that logic...
M	CAPTAIN MEDLEY	Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart. That award doesn't applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It applauds honor. His subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the Gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then. It's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it?! He absolutely was. Three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another. War isn't a CNN Special. Half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline -- either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all. It was ugly. And they don't put ugly on TV. [Looking at Starks] If Starks did kill that officer ... [Beat] You can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind.
M	DEFENSE	For God's sake, my client said he thinks he's already died once. He doesn't know what's going on. I don't know how it happened. STARKS' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness.
M	JURY FOREMAN	On the count of first degree murder, we find the defendant, William Starks, not guilty by reason of insanity. I hereby sentence you to be committed to a facility for the criminally insane, where I hope that doctors and the proper treatment can help you...
M	JUDGE [O.S.]	Mr. Starks, I hope that someday you might be well so that we will have lost only one life in this tragedy.
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	I'd certainly say he should be considered violent, just given his case...
M	DR. BECKER	How'd he dodge a conviction?
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	His defense argued post-traumatic stress and delusional disorder. He evidently couldn't account for a similar incident during his service in Desert Storm.
M	DR. BECKER	[Beat] So why isn't he just in the psych ward of the county jail?
M	CHIEF OF STAFF	Apparently, he's a decorated vet. And had another one testify for him. Who knows? [To DR. BECKER] Tom, do you mind taking him?
M	BECKER	William? William, can you hear me?
M	BECKER	I've given you some drugs to help with your adjustment... What kind of drugs? [Beat] 'Cause these seem pretty...pretty serious.
M	BECKER	Well, your condition's pretty serious.
M	STARKS	[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
M	BECKER	I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
M	STARKS	Depends on what you're seeing.
M	BECKER	You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
M	STARKS	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you? It's not my job to believe you. You're a doctor. I would think... It's not my job to believe you or to understand you. It's my job to try to cure you and if that's a no-go, then to...take some kind of care of you.
M	STARKS [Flatly]	Lucky me.
M	BECKER [Stupefied]	You shot a man three times: first in his heart, then in his stomach and then...point blank, in the back of his head. And then you just...forgot all about it. A whole life erased with three easy little words: I. Don't. Know. What would it be if we could all not know what we didn't want to have to face.
M	STARKS [Softly]	I don't belong here. I don't...
M	STARKS [Mumbling]	I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Will you listen to me? I'm not going to hurt you. Please. I didn't mean to bump...I'm sorry.
M	BECKER	It's ok, Harold. It's ok. I don't belong here... Get him to his room.
M	NURSE HARDING	Come on, army boy. Time for some therapy.
M	STARKS	Wait. Wait a minute... Please.
M	STARKS	I, I don't belong here.
M	BECKER	No. I don't think you do either. [Beat] But neither of us can do anything about that. BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with
M	BECKER	Take him out of it.
M	BECKER	William. William, can you hear me? Pulse is 16, temp, just a hair under 90. 'Bout right for three hours of psychosis.
M	NURSE HARDING	That's not enough, is it? It's enough for now. Take him to the infirmary and let him recover there. Let's get you a destination other than this wall.
M	MACKENZIE	That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
M	STARKS	Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
M	MACKENZIE	TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie. Welcome to the village, William Starks. I'm not really in the mood to talk. That's too bad. I don't believe in disposable language either -- you know, the small talk, the little talk. Chit. Chat. Useless. The game's something else though. Think about it: What can we trade with each other in the air between us? This... [running his hand through the air] is our court. [Beat, so eager it's sad] I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.
M	STARKS [Relenting]	What are you in here for?
M	MACKENZIE	I tried to kill my wife.
M	STARKS	Don't you go to jail for that?
M	MACKENZIE	I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to
M	MACKENZIE	She's bigger than me, and she's stronger than me. And I never planned on doing it. It was always in the heat of the moment. I didn't beat her or anything. Hell, she beat me. But when we'd start fighting, I'd go for the knife. Then she kept threatening to have me put away, and [looking around] she finally did.
M	STARKS	Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
M	MACKENZIE	Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
F	DR. LORENSON	Morning, gentlemen. How are you doing today?
M	MACKENZIE	It's a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson. [Finally turns to face her, grimly] The world around me, it's shrinking. There's not even room for light to make its way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da- da-bum! I feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me, Doc. Only today, he's not carrying flowers.
M	MACKENZIE	What? It's better than fine.
F	DR. LORENSON	And you, Mr. Starks? I'm fine.
F	DR. LORENSON	Mr. MacKenzie, do you think I could talk to Mr. Starks privately?
M	MACKENZIE	Of course you can, Doc. William, it was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for playing. woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. [Beat] They don't eat you when there's music playing.
F	DR. LORENSON	So you're ok?
M	STARKS [Still distracted]	What?
F	DR. LORENSON	I asked you if you're ok.
M	STARKS [Suspiciously]	I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You think there's anything wrong with me?
F	DR. LORENSON	I don't know. You're not my patient.
F	DR. LORENSON	You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
M	STARKS	I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
M	STARKS	You done with your small talk?
F	DR. LORENSON	Sure.
M	STARKS	Good.
M	DAMON	I'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen you coming there. Were you worried about me? [Smiling] That's so sweet. Thanks.
M	NURSE HARDING	You gonna get the fuck up?
M	BECKER	I'm glad to see you're cooperating this time, Mr. Starks.
M	DR. GRIES	Hold him while I get the tranquilizer.
M	DAMON	Fuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot.
M	BECKER	No. That's not necessary.
M	BECKER	Let him go. [More firmly] I said, let him go! What, Starks? What are you going to do? End me just because I'm an inconvenience to you? [Beat] Just like you did with Officer Harrison?
M	BECKER	The only thing your mind is missing is a conscience.
M	DR. GRIES	Wait...Dr. Becker, how long do you want us to leave him in for?
M	DR. GRIES	Just strap him in for now.
M	DR. GRIES	You ok?
M	BECKER	I'm fine.
M	DR. GRIES	[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
M	BECKER	Then don't. But... what about Starks?
M	BECKER	What about Starks?
M	DR. GRIES	Should we be... Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
M	DR. GRIES	But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that? BECKER [As if stunned by the question] Leaving him in? [Beat] The medication I'm given him is intended to adjust -- maybe even reset -- his violent proclivities. You know, peel away some of those layers of hate. The Jacket's merely a safe place for that to happen. The grounds and the halls -- where I can't monitor side effects I can't predict -- aren't. But, but...what about... But...but what about the gun? I mean, should he have been firing away like that? [Shaking his head at GRIES] You can't fuck up a life that's already been fucked up. [Turning away] There, there's the insurance you're looking for.
M	DR. GRIES	I'm not looking for anything.
M	BECKER	[Beat] It's Christmas Eve, Justin. Don't you have somewhere to be?
M	NURSE HARDING	Ah, man, look, It's A Wonderful Life.
M	DAMON	You got any booze? 'Course I do. [Smiling] And it is the season for giving so let's get to it. When they take you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them.
M	MACKENZIE (O.S.)	They don't eat you when there's music playing.
M	WAITRESS	Where do you think you're going?
M	WAITRESS	You gonna answer me?
M	WAITRESS	If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
M	STARKS	[Beat] I'm not deaf.
M	WAITRESS	Good.
M	WAITRESS	[As if she owes him an explanation] I forgot my purse.
M	WAITRESS	In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
M	STARKS	[Beat] Thanks.
M	WAITRESS	All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
M	STARKS	I'm not sure.
M	WAITRESS	Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
M	WAITRESS	[Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister? Yeah, I do.
M	WAITRESS	Great, get in. So, where do you want me to drop you?
M	STARKS	I'm not sure.
M	WAITRESS	You don't have anywhere to stay?
M	STARKS	I don't think so.
M	WAITRESS	Well, where are you from?
M	STARKS	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
M	WAITRESS	Of course you don't know.
M	STARKS	Why "of course"?
M	WAITRESS	Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
M	STARKS	Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
M	WAITRESS	At least you're honest. That's some kind of start.
M	WAITRESS	That's great. You're not sure where you're from or where you're going, but at least you've got manners.
M	WAITRESS	Well, you got a coat or something? No. Doesn't look like it.
M	WAITRESS	Well, how'd you get here?
M	STARKS	[Beat] I was dropped off.
M	WAITRESS	Do you have a motel or something? Money?
M	STARKS	No.
M	WAITRESS	Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
M	STARKS	No. [Beat] Not around here. All right, we'll get to my place and call around, see where I can take you. [Beat] Just don't think of trying anything. I have the biggest defense for gun control living upstairs from me. She's armed and angry even when she's asleep. I could have him there in 15 minutes. [Beat, disappointed] Hmm. Yeah, thanks. Merry Christmas to you, too.
M	WAITRESS	Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
M	STARKS	Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
M	WAITRESS	Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
M	STARKS	I'll manage.
M	WAITRESS	No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
M	STARKS	No, I'm ok.
M	WAITRESS	Shit! That was one of my good glasses! Hey, you ok?
M	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine. You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
M	STARKS	I'm not gonna hurt you.
M	WAITRESS [Softly]	I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm gonna go take a bath. Make yourself at home. You know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. And don't snoop, ok?
M	STARKS	Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the way. No, no. Let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see, I don't want to meet you. I may want to help you tonight, but I don't want to know you. Honest.
M	WAITRESS	What's this?
M	STARKS	The best I could do with what was in your fridge. She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a
M	STARKS	I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
M	WAITRESS	No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
M	WAITRESS	You want a drink?
M	STARKS	Sure.
M	WAITRESS	This is pretty good. Considering...
M	STARKS	Thanks.
M	STARKS	So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
M	WAITRESS	Yup. That's me.
M	STARKS	You like it?
M	WAITRESS	[Beat] I do it.
M	STARKS	Have you always been a waitress? No. I used to be a nurse.
M	STARKS	[Beat] Why'd you stop?
M	WAITRESS	Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
M	STARKS	I don't know, but I think part of it's...
M	STARKS	That I don't really know what's real.
M	WAITRESS	Well, good for you.
M	STARKS	[Beat] Why?
M	WAITRESS	[Beat] Real is overrated.
M	STARKS	You don't think that's crazy?
M	WAITRESS	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
M	WAITRESS	Sometimes I don't know the difference myself. And, you know something? I think I like it better that way. [Finishes her drink] You want another one?
M	BOB DYLAN	If you go when the snow flakes storm When the rivers freeze and summer ends. Please see she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howlin' winds...
M	STARKS	This is a great song.
M	WAITRESS	You remember it? It's like I feel like...I know who I am. I just can't remember anything that made me this person.
M	STARKS	But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
M	WAITRESS	May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple. Why don't I try to get them to stop blinking?
M	STARKS	They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
M	WAITRESS	So you never knew your mother?
M	STARKS	I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
M	WAITRESS	I'm sorry.
M	STARKS	Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
M	WAITRESS	Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
M	STARKS	How?
M	WAITRESS	She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
M	STARKS	I'm sorry.
M	WAITRESS	Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
M	STARKS	That when you stopped being a nurse?
M	WAITRESS [Exhausted]	Yeah, that's when I stopped being a nurse. I never thought I could stop being one, I wanted it for so long, but... you just can't do it anymore when you lose someone like that. You can't take care of other people. STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him
M	DR. GRIES	William, can you hear me?
M	STARKS	Jackie? Jackie?
F	JACKIE	Hm... Jackie? [Beat] What year is it? What? What year is it? Jackie? [Beat] What year is it? She SHOOTS UP from the sink, staring at her reflection.
M	JACKIE [Desperately]	Who are you?
M	STARKS	[Beat] I'm William Starks.
F	JACKIE	Get the hell out of my house!
F	JACKIE	What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
M	STARKS	[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police. Your mom was passed out on the side of the road when I found you. Her name was Jean. [Beat] She was dizzy the whole time...
M	JACKIE [Trembling]	Why would you do something like this? I tried to help you.
M	STARKS	Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
F	JACKIE	What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
M	STARKS	No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
F	JACKIE	Well, you belong in one.
M	STARKS [Solemnly]	[Beat] You and your mom were in a truck and she kept a rifle in the back of it...
F	JACKIE	Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her
M	STARKS	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
F	JACKIE	You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
M	STARKS	[Beat] What? William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave. [Beat] What?
F	JACKIE	His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine... Alpine Grove. That's the mental hospital. How do you know that?
F	JACKIE	I looked it up.
M	STARKS	How? Then he remembers -- understanding with a chill that what she
M	STARKS	I gave you my dog tags.
F	JACKIE	No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
M	STARKS	How'd he die?
F	JACKIE	I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through
F	JACKIE	I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now. It's December 25th, 1993 today.
F	JACKIE	No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
M	STARKS [Desperate]	That can't be. That's...just, I mean... You're telling me I died in less than a week in the time I'm in.
F	JACKIE	I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
M	STARKS	I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
F	JACKIE	Please...
F	JACKIE	Happy Birthday.
M	MEDLEY	You walk on. They pick up their guns and fire at you, you stay. They pick up and fire at each other, and you walk on!
M	STARKS	He's got his gun pointed at a kid.
M	MEDLEY	That is not our problem. Yeah, well, none of this is our fuckin' problem.
M	MEDLEY	We are leaving this site right now. Hey! You left him in all night?
M	NURSE HARDING	Shit, he's probably dead.
M	DR. GRIES [Defensively]	I tried to ask you if we should leave him in yesterday...
M	BECKER	Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
M	DR. GRIES	We never should have done this to him... Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
M	DR. GRIES	Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead?
M	BECKER	No. [To Harding and Damon] Get him upstairs.
F	LORENSON	Where's William Starks.
M	NURSE	I'm not sure. Dr. Becker had him moved. Dr. Becker! Dr. Becker!...Tom, wait! Where's William Starks?
M	BECKER	He's recovering on the third floor.
F	LORENSON	Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
M	BECKER	Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
F	LORENSON	He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom. His behavior's hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics.
M	BECKER	And you know that from what, a couple two-minute stares across a room?
M	LORENSON [Firmly]	He didn't need anti-psychotics, if that's even all you're giving him...? After he slashed me with a hospital instrument, I determined, in my professional opinion, that Mr. Starks, needed a little placating.
F	LORENSON	[Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked?
M	BECKER	You sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I took five stitches during a routine therapy session.
F	LORENSON	I'm sure he took some, too. Happens sometimes when you've got to restrain them. You watch the rest of us work. You know that. Our patients are sick.
M	BECKER	Yes, they are.
F	LORENSON	He's not gonna end up like Casey, Tom. Whatever happened to him is not going to "happen" to Starks. I don't know what you're trying to do here ...but he's not a lab animal, Tom. You can't reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment.
M	BECKER	Jesus, you really don't let up, do you? Just because you failed your patient doesn't necessarily mean the rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to tarnish your war hero's image, but he is psychotic.
M	BECKER	Now, if you'll excuse me, it's Christmas, and I have a family I'd like to see. How can I help you?
F	JACKIE	Hi, Claire.
M	CLAIRE	Jackie, hi. How are you, honey?
F	JACKIE	I'm ok. [Beat] I need a favor. National Epilepsy Conference include Dr. Lorenson,
M	STARKS	What the hell kind of drugs are you people giving me?
M	BECKER [O.S.]	Just something to help you sleep. Did you say something?
M	BECKER	I said the drugs were to help you sleep. [Beat] Did you sleep well?
M	STARKS [Doubtfully]	But I wasn't asleep. Was I?
M	BECKER	Yes. You were. You were asleep for nearly a whole day. It's December 26th, William.
M	STARKS	It's December 26th?
M	BECKER	That's right, William.
M	BECKER	Yes. [Caustically] And that's the sun and you're on earth. [Beat] And I know you know better.
M	STARKS	I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
M	BECKER	In where?
M	STARKS	[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
M	BECKER	We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
M	STARKS	That wasn't a fucking restraint.
M	BECKER	Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
M	BECKER	Relax.
M	STARKS	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
M	BECKER	[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
M	BECKER	You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
M	STARKS	Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
M	STARKS	I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
M	BECKER	I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
M	STARKS	I don't give a shit about your patient!
M	BECKER	I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
M	BECKER	Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year old girl. [Beat] His lawyers asked me to have a look at him because, after his deeds were done... he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and woofed like a dog. He couldn't even remember his name when I spoke to him, but, curiously enough, he could speak back. [Beat] Ted never went to prison because everyone -- including me -- was convinced he was sick. So he came here.
M	BECKER	Then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit a relative and I caught Ted stealing looks at her -- the kind you really have to steal if you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked Ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he had... slain ...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a look I'll never forget, and, when he answered, it wasn't with a color or any sort of physical description I'd expect. "Oh yes," he said. "I remember it. I remember it well." [Beat] Those were actually his last words I think.
M	STARKS	We are not birds of a feather.
M	BECKER	Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of. happened... What happened to your cheek, Dr. Becker?
M	BECKER	I was careless. Happens sometimes.
M	JACKIE [O.S.]	They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
M	STARKS [O.S.]	How'd he die?
M	JACKIE [O.S.]	I don't know. But he did die. Hey. You're not supposed to be out here. STARKS stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where What are you going to do to me?
F	LORENSON	Well...
M	LORENSON [Nonchalantly]	I thought I'd just ask you to come back inside with me.
M	STARKS	And if I didn't want to come?
F	LORENSON	I guess I'd ask you why.
M	STARKS	Because I don't think I'm crazy.
F	LORENSON	You're not crazy.
F	LORENSON	You suffer from delusional disorder. That doesn't mean you're... crazy. It just means you're confused. And you're here, instead of in jail, because that was determined to have played a role in your killing of a police officer. Alleged killing of a police officer.
F	LORENSON	You were convicted of the crime.
M	STARKS	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
F	LORENSON	You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
M	STARKS	No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
F	LORENSON	[Beat] William, I'd like to ask you something if I can.
M	STARKS	Since when do people around here have to ask permission to do anything? How's your treatment progressing with Dr. Becker?
M	STARKS	Fine. [Beat] Why made you ask?
M	LORENSON [Carefully]	I just hope you'd let me know if that wasn't the case.
M	STARKS	Why, what would you do?
F	LORENSON	I could try to...make it stop.
M	STARKS	No. I don't want it to.
F	LORENSON	So it's helping? STARKS [Choosing his words carefully] [Beat] It's making me feel like a different person. You comin'?
F	LORENSON	You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
M	STARKS	Believe me, I know.
M	STARKS	What were you talking about the other day?
M	MACKENZIE	I wasn't talking about anything.
M	STARKS	Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
M	STARKS	What do you know about the Jacket?
M	MACKENZIE	I know you need one when it's really cold.
M	STARKS	[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
M	MACKENZIE	Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
M	STARKS	[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
M	MACKENZIE	[Beat] How do you know?
M	STARKS	The Jacket.
M	MACKENZIE	Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
M	STARKS	No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
F	HARDING	What are you two yappin' about? [Beat] We're talking about our ability to go forward in time, to go into the future. [To Starks] That is what we're talking about here, right?
M	STARKS	Yeah, it is.
F	HARDING	You know something? You're two fucking freaks is what you are.
M	STARKS [Smiling]	Well, no shit, Einstein. What do you think we're doing in this place?
F	HARDING	I want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food. I gotta get back in it, MacKenzie. It's gonna be sticky.
M	STARKS	Why?
M	MACKENZIE	'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
M	STARKS	So what am I supposed to do?
M	MACKENZIE	You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
M	DR. GRIES	We're late.
F	LORENSON	I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
M	DR. GRIES	Maybe it's not such a waste.
F	LORENSON	It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
M	DR. GRIES	They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
F	LORENSON	What should they be looking for?
M	DR. GRIES	They should just be looking harder.
F	LORENSON	Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
M	DR. GRIES	Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now. You ok?
F	SALLY	Are you ok?
M	STARKS	Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone? Where is everyone? There's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around. But I've been alone before...
M	STARKS	Where are the other orderlies?
F	SALLY	In the therapy session downstairs. That's what the rep's sitting in on...
M	STARKS	Ok, listen. I want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you. I'll go get some doctors. Sorry I'm late, Dr. Becker.
M	BECKER	Mr. Starks, this session is for our civil patients. Damon, please take Mr. Starks back to his ward. STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.
M	STARKS [Derisively]	No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap me in a Jacket or even gag me, but please don't leave me out of therapy. This is where I feel like I make the most progress.
M	BECKER	Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a chair for yourself.
M	BECKER	Mr. Jensen, please continue. about to...
M	JENSEN	Well, [beat] I've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization.
M	BECKER [Calm as ever]	And what have they approached you about, Mr. Jensen?
M	JENSEN	They want me to head the Organization for the Organized.
M	BECKER	The Organization...for the Organized?
M	JENSEN	That's right. Have you heard of them?
M	BECKER	No, Mr. Jensen. I have not.
M	GROUP PATIENT 2	That's because there is no such Organization, you idiot.
M	JENSEN	That is categorically not true. Bl-bl- blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE. I've been asked to lead them. But, if you'd heard of them, then they wouldn't be hush-hush, would they?
M	BECKER [Wearily]	What do the rest of you think? Well, [beat] I know they exist.
M	BECKER	And how is that?
M	STARKS	When I was in the Gulf, the Organization was recruiting the Organized.
M	BECKER [Incensed]	Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? Because if it's not, it doesn't help Mr. Jensen.
M	STARKS [Looking right at Jensen]	It is a fact. Bona fide, and classified. I knew it! I knew it! Those little fuckers are everywhere.
M	STARKS	They recruit only the best, Mr. Jensen. [Beat] I didn't want to have to say this...
M	STARKS	But these people [pointing to the Doctors] know about it. In fact, when Presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they come here, to Alpine Grove. They're among us right now! [Looking right at Becker] Isn't that right, Dr. Thatcher? And Jensen, I'm proud they picked you.
M	STARKS	They're always ordering us to stay calm, but how can we be calm?
M	STARKS	[Looking suddenly directly at Becker] All they do is give orders. That's all they have to do. And no one will ever know. All it comes down to is an order. [Beat] They've got hands everywhere.
M	STARKS	Long live the Organization for the Organized!
M	BECKER	Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
M	BECKER	Sit down, Mr. Jensen!
M	RANDOM PATIENTS	Dr. Thatcher! Dr. Becker!
M	DAMON	Starks, you're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick.
M	TENNY	You ever been to jail?
M	STARKS	No.
M	TENNY	It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
M	STARKS	I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
M	TENNY	Well, I've never been to war, but I'm sure as hell not going back to prison. What's he pulling us over for? Recreation.
M	OFFICER HARRISON	Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car, with your hands at your side please.
M	STARKS	Why? Step out of the car.
M	STARKS	Ok, sir. I was just asking what for.
M	OFFICER HARRISON	This is a stolen vehicle you're driving. Now put your hands in the air, out where I can see 'em.
M	STARKS	Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?
M	TENNY	Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you ain't even worth a fucking bullet.
F	JACKIE	I'll be off in 15 minutes. Can you wait till then? The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
M	STARKS	Yeah.
F	JACKIE	It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients... So he was giving me all kinds of drugs...
M	JACKIE [Nodding]	Apparently. He was taking a lot of them, too. It said he was trying out behavior modification treatments that were banned back in the 70s -- "womb treatment" is the name he gave to what he did to you... Womb? A fuckin' womb? What kind of animal did he come out of?
F	JACKIE	But no one knew until after...
M	STARKS	After I...
F	JACKIE	[Beat] You bled to death.
M	STARKS	What?
F	JACKIE	I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it. And you're sure my body was found on January 1st? JACKIE nods.
M	STARKS	Do you really believe me?
F	JACKIE	I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
F	JACKIE	[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
M	STARKS	Yes. Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
M	STARKS	I know.
F	JACKIE	Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
M	STARKS	If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
M	STARKS	I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
F	JACKIE	I know.
M	STARKS	How? Did they figure it out after I died?
F	JACKIE	No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
M	DR. MORGAN	I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then. His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
M	DR. MORGAN	No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
M	STARKS	What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
M	DR. MORGAN	Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
M	STARKS	What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
M	DR. MORGAN	Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
F	JACKIE	Do you have any kind of forwarding address for Dr. Becker? Your father was here 12 years ago. I doubt the hospital would have that, if Dr. Becker is still even alive. [Beat, a little suspiciously] Is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died?
M	STARKS	He was the only family I remember.
M	DR. MORGAN [Nodding]	I'll see what I can find out about Dr. Becker. And maybe Dr. Lorenson will know something.
M	DR. MORGAN	Let me just tell her we're here.
F	LORENSON	Hello. I'm Beth Lorenson.
F	LORENSON	It's nice to meet you, Mr. Starks...
F	LORENSON	And you are...?
F	JACKIE	I'm just William's friend.
F	LORENSON	I think we'll be fine from here. Thanks, Stanley.
F	LORENSON	My God you look exactly like him.
M	STARKS	I never knew my father. Did you?
F	LORENSON	Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
M	STARKS	Why? LORENSON considers her answer.
F	LORENSON	At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
M	STARKS	You thought my father was crazy?
F	LORENSON	No. I don't think he was crazy. He needed help...but he wasn't crazy. [Beat] Your father actually helped me with a case of mine.
M	STARKS	What case?
F	LORENSON	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
F	JACKIE	Who was Eugene?
M	LORENSON [Peaked]	He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you familiar with the case?
F	JACKIE	Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
F	LORENSON	It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
F	JACKIE	How?
F	LORENSON	He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
F	JACKIE	I don't understand.
F	LORENSON	I still don't either, even after all these years.
M	STARKS	Do you know how my father died?
M	LORENSON [Unconvincingly]	I don't know how much I remember but I seem to think it was from a... cut or blow of some sort or another.
M	STARKS	How'd he get it?
F	LORENSON	[Beat] I don't know.
M	STARKS	But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
F	LORENSON	I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
M	STARKS	Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
F	LORENSON	How do you know about Dr. Becker?
M	STARKS	My dad wrote some things down before he died.
F	LORENSON	That's right. He did.
F	LORENSON	So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
M	STARKS	Why would we do that?
F	JACKIE	Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
F	LORENSON	I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
M	STARKS	I wouldn't be so sure. Like you said about back then, you might not know everything going on around here. It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
M	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, it is. It's almost as if your life depended on it. Isn't it?
M	STARKS	Exactly.
F	LORENSON	Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
M	STARKS	[Beat] We will.
M	STARKS	I don't believe a thing she just said.
F	JACKIE	Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
M	STARKS	I have no idea.
F	JACKIE	You think Lorenson kills you?
M	STARKS	Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
F	JACKIE	Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
M	STARKS	Why?
F	JACKIE	Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
M	STARKS	[Beat] There's one more thing I want to see.
M	STARKS	This was the room. They used to hang the Jacket there. [Turning to Jackie] This is where it happened. This is the room I'm actually in right now.
M	STARKS	I can show you. It's probably in there.
F	JACKIE	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...
M	STARKS	Yes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were the only things I could move. [Beat] Dead bodies don't bleed. And they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal.
M	DAMON	You folks ain't supposed to be down here.
F	JACKIE	We were just leaving.
M	DAMON	Do I know you from somewhere?
M	STARKS	You may have known my father, William Starks. DAMON smiles, remembering...
M	DAMON	That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
M	STARKS	He didn't either.
M	DAMON [With a dirty laugh]	I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when he had you. [Beat] You could be his ghost.
M	STARKS	Did you know my father?
M	DAMON	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
M	STARKS	You wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you? No, I don't. I just remember them finding his body.
M	STARKS	You don't know any more, Damon?
M	DAMON [Shocked]	How'd you know my name?
M	STARKS	My father used to talk about you.
M	DAMON	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
M	STARKS	He said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail.
M	DAMON	Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me... That's too bad.
M	DAMON	I thought you said you never knew your father.
M	STARKS	I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
M	DAMON	I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
M	STARKS	He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
M	DAMON	I never touched your father! I swear! Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven
M	STARKS	You know something, Damon? You're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick. Live with it.
F	JACKIE	How long do we have?
M	STARKS	I don't know.
F	JACKIE	They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
M	STARKS	How far away is that?
M	PAGE MISSING	
F	JACKIE	What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
M	STARKS	I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say. Well, doesn't what he did to you make you mad?
M	STARKS	Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
F	JACKIE	You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
M	STARKS	I might not be able to.
F	JACKIE	It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
F	LORENSON	You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
M	STARKS	I'll die either way.
F	LORENSON	I can't try to help you unless you let me. [Beat] I know about the Jacket.
F	LORENSON	I'm sorry for what you were put through, and I'm sorry I couldn't stop it earlier. But I promise you that I will from now on... I don't want you to. What do you mean?
M	STARKS	You have no idea what's going on.
F	LORENSON	No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
M	STARKS	Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
F	LORENSON	How can you say that in your physical condition? Do you realize that it's because you were put in it that you're as...weak as you are now? Becker's a man who's not well himself.
M	STARKS	You don't understand.
F	LORENSON	Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
M	STARKS	This has nothing to do with that. Then what? What? [Beat] I can't guess it. You have to help me. ...What you do not know is the only thing you know. [Beat] And what you own is what you do not own... And where you are is where you are not.
F	LORENSON	[Beat] Where is that from?
M	STARKS	I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
F	LORENSON	Come on. Tell me what you do know.
M	STARKS	[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket. Well, what time is it? STARKS
M	STARKS	You don't believe me. Well, what year do you think it is now? STARKS [Exasperated] I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992. Same as every sane person.
F	LORENSON	Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
M	STARKS	It doesn't look all that different.
F	LORENSON	The future doesn't look different?
M	STARKS	No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from. What about the world?
M	STARKS	I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
F	LORENSON	Do you think you're traveling in time? Is that it?
M	STARKS	Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc.
F	LORENSON	[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
M	STARKS	Maybe. Did he tell you he tried to kill his wife?
F	LORENSON	MacKenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here. All because his wife left him for another man. Maybe that just makes him weak, not crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat] Still doesn't make me think I am.
M	STARKS [Adjusting it himself]	And, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think I am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first.
F	LORENSON	Why don't you help me?
M	STARKS	Because I don't have time.
F	LORENSON	Why not?
M	STARKS	I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
F	LORENSON	And how do you know that?
M	STARKS	Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
F	LORENSON	William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
M	STARKS	And what about your work with Eugene -- the kid? Is that another facet of my delusions?
F	LORENSON	How do you know about Eugene?
M	STARKS	You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
M	LORENSON [Somewhat angrily]	How do you know about Eugene!? You told me. It's like two parts of you talking through me. Look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way I could know about him.
F	LORENSON	There obviously is, so what don't you just tell me how you found out about him.
M	STARKS	Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
F	LORENSON	I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
M	STARKS	NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
F	LORENSON	One thing's got nothing to do with the other.
M	STARKS	One's got everything to do with the other. So unless you want my blood on your hands...leave what's between me and Becker between me and Becker.
M	MACKENZIE	Hey, I brought you some smokes.
M	STARKS	Lorenson said your wife left you for another man and that's when you lost it.
M	MACKENZIE	Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
M	STARKS	Is it true?
M	MACKENZIE	She left me, I tried to kill her, I tried to kill myself. She was mean, I was weak, I was cruel so she left, I didn't plan it, didn't see it...FINE!
M	MACKENZIE [Softly]	I didn't want to see it. I'm in here because they say I have a nervous condition. [Beat] Well, here's my question, who wouldn't be nervous if they really looked at their life? [Beat] Whose life is that good?
M	MACKENZIE	Not this luckless little mammal's. What difference is it to them? [Beat, slows down] You believe what you want to believe. One version is easier than another so you make it your own.
M	MACKENZIE	I'll tell you this though. However nuts I am, I wasn't nuts enough not to know how wrong it was to put a human being in something like that.
M	STARKS	MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
M	MACKENZIE	[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
M	STARKS	Becker does? Are you sure?
M	MACKENZIE	I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
M	STARKS	Thanks for the cigarettes. You still got a lot of problems, MacKenzie, but you're ok.
M	BECKER	At least it's some kind of bars we've got you behind.
M	BECKER	Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about. That's too bad.
M	BECKER	It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year. They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
M	BECKER	Temporarily.
M	STARKS	Makes it a little easier for me to get away with mine.
M	BECKER	And what's that?
M	STARKS	My business? Yes.
M	STARKS	Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
M	BECKER	You killed him?
M	STARKS	And wound up in a better cage. [Beat] But I still want to make a deal.
M	STARKS	See, the deluxe lab animal treatment I've been receiving -- well, I don't think it's worked. I woke up today and realized... [eerily lowering his voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So really, what was the point? Torture? I think that's still sort of illegal in some states -- though we'll have to check on Vermont. And, how's this for the cherry on top: it seems my physician is a pill-popping freak. [Beat] Last time I checked, that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly] "I don't remember everything they did to me. I just remember the worst parts." I think I should be sitting down when I say it, don't you think?
M	BECKER	I think...I have to think about it. I think your story needs a little fleshing out before it's ready to go.
M	BECKER	I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
M	STARKS	You sure you know where to find one?
M	BECKER	I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
M	STARKS	And what does that mean?
M	BECKER	Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
M	STARKS	Becker, how do you sleep at night?
M	BECKER	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
F	LORENSON	Nina, William Starks is to stay in ICU all night. If anything is supposed to change, I want to be called about it.
F	NINA	Sure, Dr. Lorenson.
F	LORENSON	Hi. [Beat] Sorry I'm late.
M	TALIA	It's ok. [To Eugene] Hi, Eugene.
F	LORENSON	Talia, I need to ask you something. What is it?
F	LORENSON	Have you told anyone about my sessions with Eugene? Of course not. [Off Lorenson's still doubtful look] I swear I haven't. I wouldn't do that to Eugene, or you. You know that.
F	LORENSON	Has anyone been asking about him?
M	TALIA	No. I would have told you.
M	DAMON	No funny business or we can make this a lot fucking harder for you.
M	STARKS	[Weakly] No funny business.
F	LORENSON	Eugene, this is a "TRAIN."
F	LORENSON	Come on back down here. Wherever you are...try to come on back. You'll like it, I promise. Then, JACKIE unexpectedly appears outside the DRIVER'S WINDOW
F	JACKIE	You just scared me, that's all. Me, too.
F	JACKIE	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
M	JACKIE [O.S.]	I think this is his house.
M	STARKS	You're sure?
F	JACKIE	Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired
F	JACKIE	They're not here.
M	STARKS	They're not.
F	JACKIE	[Beat, lost] No.
F	JACKIE	Maybe they're out.
F	JACKIE	How much time do we have?
M	STARKS [Distracted]	I don't know.
F	JACKIE	What? What are you thinking?
M	STARKS	There're no cars on this street.
F	JACKIE	Yeah, you're right. But wait, how can that be?
M	STARKS	I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
F	JACKIE	I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
M	STARKS	Then why isn't there anyone around?
F	JACKIE	[Beat] I don't know.
F	JACKIE	What are you doing?
F	JACKIE	William! William!
F	JACKIE	Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have to come back.
M	STARKS	Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? It's Sunday. It's Sunday.
F	JACKIE	So?
M	STARKS	Look where these people live.
M	STARKS	They've got lives to be grateful for.
F	JACKIE	William, you're not making sense.
M	STARKS	[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
M	STARKS	You still go to Church. How's that work? Your God just doesn't notice? That it? [Beat, serious] How you doin', Dr. Becker?
M	BECKER'S GRANDSON	Grandpa? Sean, why don't you wait for me by the car? I'll be there in a minute. [Turning to the kid] Ok?
M	BECKER [To Starks]	Can I help you?
M	STARKS	I don't know, Dr. Becker. Can you?
M	BECKER	Who are you?
M	STARKS	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
M	BECKER	[Beat] You're his son?
M	STARKS	No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
M	BECKER	How...how are you here?
M	BECKER	You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
M	STARKS	I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
M	BECKER	No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
M	STARKS	I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
M	BECKER	I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
M	STARKS	I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
M	BECKER	I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
M	STARKS	How?
M	BECKER	Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
M	BECKER	Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get... Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
M	BECKER	It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
M	STARKS	So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
M	BECKER	The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
M	STARKS	No, we were patients.
M	BECKER	You and the others didn't seem that way then.
M	STARKS	Who were the others? Nathan Piechowski, Jackson MacGregor, and Ted Casey. [Beat] I didn't ask for you -- for any of you. You were all sent to me.
M	BECKER	What is it?
M	BECKER	How did you come to know their names?
M	STARKS	You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. I don't understand...
M	STARKS	I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
M	BECKER	I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
M	STARKS	No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
M	BECKER [Stoically]	I was sorry when I heard you died. I was, but...how was I to know you didn't shoot that police officer?
M	STARKS	The same way you just said I didn't without my ever telling you. [Beat] And that still doesn't excuse what you did. Just because you had keys to a cage didn't mean you had animals inside. [Beat] You've earned your guilt, Becker.
F	JACKIE	That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
M	STARKS	No, he didn't.
F	JACKIE	What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
M	STARKS	No one's killing anyone.
M	STARKS	Touch me. I'm okay.
M	STARKS	If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
F	JACKIE	Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
M	STARKS	Where are we going?
F	JACKIE	To the hospital.
F	JACKIE	Claire, I need help.
M	STARKS	What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
F	JACKIE	Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
M	CLAIRE	Jesus, what's happened to him?
M	STARKS	Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
F	JACKIE	Ok. Ssh. Rest.
M	JACKIE [In a panic]	He's not...?
M	CLAIRE	No, no. [Beat] Not yet. But he doesn't have long. Are you sure you don't want a doctor to look at him?
F	JACKIE	No! It won't do any good. [Beat] Please, Claire. They won't understand. FLASHBACK TO:
M	TENNY	Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
M	STARKS	Where are you going?
M	TENNY	I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
M	TENNY	Can you drive?
M	STARKS	Sure.
M	TENNY	Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
F	JACKIE	William, please, honey, wake up. For me.
F	JACKIE	Can you hear me?
F	JACKIE	I found out about Eugene. The little boy. He's the key. That's who you have to tell her about when you get back there. It's the only way to prove this to her.
M	STARKS	Jackie? Where do you live?
F	JACKIE	What?
M	STARKS	When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
F	JACKIE	112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
M	STARKS	You gotta stop thinking like that.
F	JACKIE	Then, where are you going?
M	STARKS	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick. STARKS moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room. You come back to me... Oh dear God.
M	STARKS	I'm William Starks. I'm not his son. And...and the kid you work with. Your friend's son...Eugene...
F	LORENSON	I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
M	STARKS	How...how do you know?
F	LORENSON	You told me this was how it happened.
M	STARKS	I did?
F	LORENSON	Yeah. Who...who kills me?
F	LORENSON	You have nothing to fear, William.
M	STARKS [Whispering]	Becker, I know about you. [Beat] I know what you did to your patients.
M	STARKS	Nathan...Piechowski. [Beat] Jackson MacGregor...Ted Casey. [Beat] You didn't cure them. You killed them.
F	SALLY	Would you like anything, Dr. Lorenson?
F	LORENSON	A cup of coffee would be great, Sally. Thanks.
F	SALLY	Is he gonna be ok?
F	LORENSON	I hope so. Me, too.
F	LORENSON	You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
M	STARKS	Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me? LORENSON doesn't answer.
M	STARKS	Can I get some paper and something to write with.
F	LORENSON	What for? I'm starting to think I'm really gonna die soon. So I'd like to write some things down.
F	LORENSON	I'm not gonna let that happen.
M	STARKS	You still don't believe me, do you?
F	LORENSON	I do believe you...
M	STARKS	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
M	STARKS	No one knows you're working with him so how would I have found out? He's your friend's son, right?
F	LORENSON	William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
M	STARKS	Listen to me. That's all I ask.
M	STARKS	He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
F	LORENSON	Who told you this?
M	STARKS	You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
M	STARKS	I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
F	LORENSON	What are you talking about? You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
F	LORENSON	Hey. What is it?
M	LORENSON [Finding it hard to explain]	Nothing. [Beat] I don't know. I thought of something I could try.
F	LORENSON	Come on Eugene, try to say it with me. This is a "DOG".
M	EUGENE	D--d---d----.
M	LORENSON [Softly]	What's happening to you?
F	LORENSON	Are you having a seizure? Is that really what's going on?
M	EUGENE	Dog. [To Talia] Hi. You're going to...shock the boy and then things will change for him.
F	LORENSON	You ok, Eugene? Yeah, you are ok. What's happening? He got a little shock. [To himself] And it's reset him. Not permanently probably...but at least for a little while. They use it on epileptic patients sometimes...
M	TALIA	But he's not epileptic.
F	LORENSON	No, but he is having seizures.
M	STARKS	It worked, didn't it?
M	STARKS	This is really happening, isn't it? [Beat] What do you need me to do?
M	STARKS	[Beat] Thank you. I need to get this letter to someone.
F	DR. LORENSON	I can't take you out of here in your condition...
M	STARKS	And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
F	DR. LORENSON	No, it hasn't. Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
M	STARKS	You know how to get there?
F	LORENSON	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
M	STARKS	Good.
F	LORENSON	You want me to come with you?
M	STARKS	No, I'll be ok.
M	STARKS	Hi.
M	JACKIE [Surprised]	Hey. [Beat] I remember you.
M	STARKS	I remember you, too.
M	STARKS	Jackie, how have you been?
F	JACKIE	I've been ok.
M	STARKS	Good. How's your mom?
F	JACKIE	Ok, I guess.
M	STARKS	Do you think I could see her? She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in
F	JACKIE	Sure.
F	JEAN	Can I help you?
M	STARKS	Hey, Jean. Nice to see you.
F	JEAN	I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
F	JACKIE	Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
F	JEAN	Oh, yeah. There something you need?
M	STARKS	You could say that.
F	JEAN	Jackie, go play in the snow.
F	JACKIE	Why?
F	JEAN	Just do it.
M	STARKS	I can't stay long. [Motioning to Lorenson] That's my doctor and I gotta get back to the hospital. Everything I want to say is in this letter. [Beat] You can check as much of it as you can.
M	STARKS	I won't be around when you read it...but I hope you believe it. It'd be a real shame if you didn't.
M	STARKS	[Beat] I should be on my way.
M	STARKS	Bye, Jackie. STARKS Happy New Year to both of you.
F	JEAN	Thanks. You, too.
F	JACKIE	Hey, wait!
M	STARKS	[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
F	JACKIE	Ok. I was 25 years old the first time I died. It didn't end anything though. [Beat] Sometimes I think we live through things only to be able to tell them, to bear witness, to say this happened.
M	STARKS (V.O.)	And it wasn't to someone else. It was to me. And I lived despite it. Sometimes I think we live to beat the odds. And sometimes I agree that life can only begin with the knowledge of death. That it can all end, even when you least want it to.
M	STARKS	I'm telling you my story because it's the only way I can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of your own. It's scary...and lucky...how much we can forget. Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because in those moments I'm talking about, you realize it doesn't. And it never had to.
M	STARKS (V.O.)	I am not a crazy man, even though they mistook me for one. I live in the same world as the rest of you. Only I saw more of it. And the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in things you don't already believing in. And, while you're alive, it's never too late.
M	DISTORTED VOICE	No! Wa...atch out! I promise you, Jean. No matter how bad the days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do asleep. I can offer you some proof: when you die, there's only one thing you want to have happen...sometimes so badly it comes true, I guess. [Beat] You want to come back.
F	JACKIE	Hey there. [Beat] You ok?
M	STARKS	I think so.
F	JACKIE	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
F	JACKIE	It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
M	STARKS	I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive. Yes, you are alive. But, listen, it's New Year's Day. You're not going to get a cab. Especially not here. And you're gonna freeze if you stand out here in the snow much longer. I'm on my way back to my shift at the hospital...
M	STARKS	You work there? JACKIE [Gesturing to her uniform] Yeah, I'm a nurse. Why don't you let me give you a ride...
M	STARKS	Thanks.
F	JACKIE	Sorry, one sec.
F	JACKIE	Hey! How are you? [Beat] Thanks. I was just thinking about you, too.
F	JACKIE	Listen, I gotta go, mom, 'cause I'm late... but, thanks. Happy New Year to you, too. I'll call you later. [Beat] Ok, bye.
F	JACKIE	Sorry about that. It was my mom.
M	STARKS	Nothin' to worry about there.
M	JACKIE (O.S.)	How you doin'?
M	STARKS	I'm doing fine.
