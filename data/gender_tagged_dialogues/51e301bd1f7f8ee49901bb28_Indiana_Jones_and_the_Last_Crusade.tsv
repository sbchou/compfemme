M	OFFICER	Dis-mount!
M	FIRST SCOUT	Herman's horsesick!
M	SCOUTMASTER	Chaps, don't anybody wander off. Some of the passageways in here can run for miles.
M	HERMAN	I don't think this is such a good idea.
M	HERMAN	What is it?
M	FEDORA	Alfred, did you get anything yet?
M	MAN	Nothing. Dig in.
M	ROSCOE	Hey, I've got something!
M	ROSCOE	I got something, Garth!
M	ROSCOE	I got something... I got something right here.
M	ROSCOE	Oh, look at thatl We're richl We're rich!
M	HALFBREED	Shut up. Shut up.
M	ROSCOE (O.S.)	Well, we're rich, ain't we?l
M	HERMAN	Indy? Indy? What are they doing? Indiana? Indiana?
M	INDY	Shhhl
M	HALFBREED	Hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back.
M	INDY	It's the Cross of Coronadol Cortes gave it to him in 15201
M	INDY	That Cross is an important artifact. It belongs in a museum.
M	INDY	Run back and find the others. Tell Mister Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.
M	INDY	Have him bring the sheriff.
M	INDY	It's only a snake.
M	INDY	Did you hear what I said?
M	HERMAN	Right. Run back. Mister Havelock. The Sheriff. What, what are you gonna do?
M	INDY	I don't know... I'll think of something.
M	FEDORA	Dig with your hands. Not with your mouth.
M	ROSCOE	He's got our thing!
M	HALFBREED	Get 'im! The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock after INDY.
M	INDY	Mister Havelock! Anybody Everybody's lost but me!
M	FEDORA	There he isl
M	MEN	Let's go! Let's get him! Let's go!
M	INDY	Hyahl Hyah!
M	ROSCOE	Hey! Come back here!
M	PANAMA HAT	Come on. Get him!
M	INDY	Oh...
M	INDY	Oh... Oh...
M	ROUGH RIDER	Here, let me.
M	INDY	Holy smokes!
M	FEDORA	Come on, kid. There's no way out of this.
M	INDY	Ohhh!
M	FEDORA	Toss up the whip.
M	FEDORA	You've got heart, kid. But that belongs to me.
M	INDY	It belongs to Coronado.
M	FEDORA	Coronado is dead. And so are all his grandchildren.
M	INDY	This should be in a museum.
M	ROSCOE	Now give me thatl
M	FEDORA	Don't let him get awayl
M	INDY	Magic?
M	FEDORA	Hold it. Make sure he doesn't double back.
M	FEDORA	Okay, kid. out of the box. Now.
M	FEDORA	Damn.
M	INDY	Dad!
M	INDY	Dad!
M	INDY	Dad!
M	INDY	Dad!
M	HENRY	Out!
M	INDY	It's important!
M	HENRY	Then waitcount to twenty.
M	INDY	No, Dad. You listen to me
M	HENRY	Junior! starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.
M	INDY	One, two, three, four...
M	HENRY	In Greek.
M	INDY	One... two... three... four...
M	HENRY	May he who illuminated this... illuminate me...
M	HERMAN	I brought the Sheriff.
M	INDY	Just the man I want to see! Now, there were five or six of them.
M	SHERIFF	All right, son.
M	INDY	... they came after... me...
M	SHERIFF	You still got it?
M	INDY	Well, yes, sir. It's right here!
M	SHERIFF	I'm glad to see that... because the rightful owner of this Cross won't press charges, if you give it back.
M	SHERIFF	He's got witnesses, five or six of them.
M	ROSCOE	Yahoo!
M	SHERIFF	Good day.
M	FEDORA	You lost today, kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.
M	PANAMA HAT	Small world, Doctor Jones.
M	INDY	Too small for two of us.
M	PANAMA HAT	This is the second time I've had to reclaim my property from you
M	INDY	That belongs in a museum
M	PANAMA HAT	So do you. Throw him over the side.
M	PANAMA HAT	Grab him, he's getting away! Grab him! BARCELONA Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths. Archaeology is...
M	INDY	... the search for fact. Not truth. If it's truth you're interested in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy class is right down the hall.
M	INDY	So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. Eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.
M	INDY	Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library. Research. Reading.
M	INDY	We cannot afford to take mythology at face value.
M	INDY	Next week: "Egyptology." Starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems for the next hour and a half.
M	INDY	Marcus! I did it!
M	BRODY	You've got itl
M	INDY	You know how long I've been looking for that?!
M	BRODY	All your life.
M	INDY	All my life!
M	BRODY	Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
M	INDY	We can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.
M	INDY	Your treat.
M	BRODY	Yes. My treat.
M	INDY	Shush! Shush! Shushl
F	IRENE	Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're back! Your mail is on your desk. Here are your phone messages.
M	MALE STUDENT	Doctor Jones, you promised... Doctor Jones
F	IRENE	This is your appointment schedule. And these term papers still haven't been graded.
M	INDY	Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn.
M	INDY	"Venice, Italy." Doctor Jonesl
M	MAN	Doctor Jones?
F	DONOVAN	I trust your trip down was comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men didn't alarm you, I hope.
F	DONOVAN	My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
M	INDY	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
F	DONOVAN	Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you.
M	INDY	Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think.
F	DONOVAN	That was our assessment as well.
M	INDY	Where did this come from?
F	DONOVAN	My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. Can you translate the inscription?
M	INDY	"... who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life. Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell.
M	INDY	Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the Temple where the cup that"
M	INDY	"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever. "
F	DONOVAN	The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
M	INDY	The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
F	DONOVAN	Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
M	INDY	An old man's dream.
F	DONOVAN	Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe.
M	INDY	Grail lore is his hobby. He's a teacher of Medieval Literature. The one the students hope they don't get.
F	MRS. DONOVAN	Walter, you're neglecting our guests.
F	DONOVAN	Be along in a moment, dear.
F	DONOVAN	Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
M	INDY	What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
F	DONOVAN	Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
F	DONOVAN	Let me tell you another "bedtime story, " Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
M	INDY	I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a Franciscan friar, I think.
F	DONOVAN	Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
F	DONOVAN	This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed outit's incomplete. Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
M	INDY	falls out from underneath your feet.
F	DONOVAN	You could be more right than you know.
M	INDY	Yes?
F	DONOVAN	We've hit a snag. our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
M	INDY	You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
F	DONOVAN	We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
M	BRODY	Your father and I have been friends since time began. I've watched you grow up, Indy. And I've watched the two of you grow apart. I've never seen you this concerned about him before.
M	INDY	Dad? He's an academic A bookworm. He's not a field mans
M	INDY	Dad? Dad?
M	BRODY	Dear God. What has the old fool got himself into now?
M	INDY	I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
M	INDY	Dad?
M	BRODY	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
M	INDY	Mail! That's it, Marcus!
M	INDY	Venice, Italy!
M	BRODY	What is it? handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with
M	INDY	It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
M	BRODY	I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
M	INDY	Do you believe, Marcus?
M	INDY	Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
M	BRODY	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
M	BRODY	But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
M	INDY	Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
M	BRODY	I'll tell him we'll take two.
M	BRODY	Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
F	DONOVAN	Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
M	BRODY	Schneider?
F	DONOVAN	I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
M	BRODY	Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
F	DONOVAN	Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very careful. Don't trust anvbody.
M	INDY	Ah, Venice...
M	BRODY	Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
M	INDY	I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
F	ELSA	Doctor Jones?
M	INDY	Yes?
F	ELSA	I knew it was you
F	ELSA	you have your father's eyes.
M	INDY	And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
F	ELSA	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
F	ELSA	Marcus Brody?
M	BRODY	That's right.
F	ELSA	Doctor Elsa Schneider.
M	BRODY	Uh... how do you do?
F	ELSA	The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
M	INDY	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
M	INDY	Frauleinwill you permit me?
F	ELSA	I usually don't.
M	INDY	I usually don't either.
F	ELSA	In that case, I permit you.
M	INDY	It would make me very happy.
F	ELSA	But I'm already sadby tomorrow it will have faded.
M	INDY	Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
M	BRODY	I hate to interrupt youbut the reason we're here
F	ELSA	Yes. I have something to show you.
F	ELSA	I left your father working in the library. He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city. When I got back to his tablehe'd gonewith all his papersexcept for that scrap which I found near his chair.
M	INDY	Roman numerals.
F	ELSA	Here is the library.
M	INDY	That doesn't look much like a library.
M	BRODY	It looks like a converted church.
F	ELSA	In this case it's the literal truth. We're on holy ground. These columns over here...
F	ELSA	... were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
F	ELSA	Now please excuse me. The library's closing in a few moments. I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.
M	INDY	MarcusI've seen this window before.
M	BRODY	Where?
M	INDY	Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?
M	BRODY	Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
M	INDY	Dad was onto something here!
M	BRODY	Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
M	INDY	My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
F	ELSA	Find something?
M	BRODY	Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.
F	ELSA	My God, I must be blind
M	INDY	Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itself
M	INDY	Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look.
M	INDY	Three.
M	INDY	Three!
M	INDY	Seven.
M	INDY	Seven... Ten.
M	INDY	And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten.
M	INDY	Three, seven and ten.
M	INDY	Ten. "X" marks the spot.
M	INDY	Bingo.
F	ELSA	You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
M	INDY	Except he's lost, and I'm not.
F	ELSA	Lower me down.
M	INDY	Look after this for me, will you?
M	INDY	Come on.
F	ELSA	Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
M	INDY	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
F	ELSA	The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
M	INDY	That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him.
M	BRODY	Ohhhh. . .
F	ELSA	What's this one?
M	INDY	The Ark of the Covenant.
F	ELSA	Are you sure?
M	INDY	Pretty sure.
M	INDY	Watch out.
M	INDY	Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire.
M	INDY	Give me the lighter.
M	INDY	Oh, rats...
M	INDY	Come onl
M	INDY	Come here.
M	INDY	Look. . .
M	INDY	It must be one of these...
F	ELSA	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
F	ELSA	It's this one.
M	INDY	This is itl we found it! Look the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker!
F	ELSA	What's that?
M	INDY	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
F	ELSA	Just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy.
F	ELSA	Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
M	INDY	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
M	INDY	Get back! Back against the wall.
M	INDY	Quick! Under it!
M	INDY	Air pocket!
M	INDY	Don't wander off.
F	ELSA	What?
F	ELSA	What?
M	INDY	I think I've found a way out. Deep breath.
M	INDY	Ah, Venicel
M	INDY	Are you crazy?! You don't go between them!
F	ELSA	Go between them? Are you crazy?!
M	INDY	I said go around!
F	ELSA	You said go between them!
M	INDY	I said don't go between them!
F	ELSA	No!!
M	INDY	Why are you trying to kill us?
M	KAZIM	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
M	INDY	My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
M	KAZIM	No.
M	INDY	Where is he? Talkor you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
M	KAZIM	If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
M	INDY	Then we'll die.
M	KAZIM	My soul is prepared. How's yours?
M	INDY	This is your last chance.
M	KAZIM	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
M	INDY	All right! Where's my father
M	KAZIM	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
M	INDY	Who are you?
M	KAZIM	My name is Kazim.
M	INDY	And why were you trying to kill me?
M	KAZIM	The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
M	KAZIM	Let me get off at this jetty.
M	KAZIM	Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
M	INDY	I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
M	KAZIM	In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
M	INDY	How's the head?
M	BRODY	It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
M	INDY	The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed.
M	INDY	The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon." But where exactly?
M	BRODY	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
M	BRODY	He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest. A map with no names.
M	BRODY	Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
M	INDY	Alexandretta. Now we know.
M	BRODY	Yes. Now we know.
M	INDY	Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
M	BRODY	What about you?
M	INDY	I'm going after Dad.
M	INDY	Elsa?
M	INDY	Elsa?
M	INDY	Elsa?
M	INDY	Elsa?
F	ELSA	My room!
M	INDY	Mine, too.
F	ELSA	What were they looking for?
M	INDY	This.
F	ELSA	The Grail Diary.
M	INDY	Uh-huh.
F	ELSA	You had it? You didn't trust me!
M	INDY	I didn't know you.
M	INDY	At least I let you tag along.
F	ELSA	Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
M	INDY	Knock it off. You're not mad.
F	ELSA	No?
M	INDY	No. You like the way I do things.
F	ELSA	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
M	INDY	Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.
F	ELSA	How dare you kiss me!
M	INDY	Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.
F	ELSA	And I hate arrogant men.
M	INDY	Ahh, Venice.
M	INDY	What do you know about this place?
F	ELSA	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
F	ELSA	What are you going to do?
M	INDY	Don't know. Think of something.
M	BUTLER	Yes?
M	INDY	And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're drenched!
M	INDY	Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle.
M	BUTLER	Are you expected?
M	INDY	Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries. BUTLER Tapestries?
M	INDY	Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
M	BUTLER	This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
M	INDY	How dare he?!
M	INDY	Nazis. I hate these guys.
M	INDY	This one. I think he's in here.
F	ELSA	How do you know?
M	INDY	Because it's wired.
F	ELSA	Indy? Indy?
M	INDY	Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back.
M	HENRY	Junior?
M	INDY	Yes, sirl
M	HENRY	It is you Junior!
M	INDY	Don't call me that, please.
M	HENRY	But what are you doing here?
M	INDY	I came to get you! What do you think?
M	HENRY	Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty.
M	HENRY	Oh, it breaks the heart.
M	INDY	And the head. You hit me, Dad!
M	HENRY	I'll never forgive myself
M	INDY	Don't worryI'm fine.
M	HENRY	Thank God!
M	HENRY	... it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section.
M	INDY	No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
M	HENRY	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
M	INDY	Dad, they come in through the doors.
M	HENRY	Good point.
M	HENRY	But better safe than sorry.
M	HENRY	Humpfso I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
M	INDY	I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
M	HENRY	Through the library?
M	INDY	Right.
M	HENRY	I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
M	INDY	Found it.
M	HENRY	He was actually there? You saw him?
M	INDY	Well, what was left of him.
M	HENRY	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
M	INDY	Alexandretta.
M	HENRY	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
M	HENRY	... you did it.
M	INDY	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
M	HENRY	If only I could have been with you.
M	INDY	There were rats, Dad.
M	HENRY	Rats?
M	INDY	Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
M	HENRY	They want my diary.
M	INDY	Yeah?
M	HENRY	I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.
M	INDY	Yeah. . .
M	S.S. OFFICER	Doctor Jones!! Yes!! S.S. OFFICER I will take the book now.
M	INDY/HENRY	What book?
M	S.S. OFFICER	You have the Diary in your pocket.
M	HENRY	You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here?
M	HENRY	You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?
M	INDY	Well, uh...
M	HENRY	You did!!
M	INDY	Look, can we discuss this later?
M	HENRY	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
M	INDY	Will you take it easy....!
M	HENRY	Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
M	INDY	I came here to save you.
M	HENRY	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
M	INDY	I told you--
M	INDY	--don't call me Junior!
M	HENRY	Look what you did!!
M	HENRY	I can't believe what you just....
M	INDY	Elsa? Elsa?
M	VOGEL	That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies.
M	HENRY	But she's one of them!
F	ELSA	Indy, please!
M	HENRY	She's a Nazi!
M	INDY	What?!
M	HENRY	Trust me!
F	ELSA	Indy, no!
M	VOGEL	I will kill her!
M	HENRY	Oh yeah? Go ahead!
M	INDY	No! Don't Shoot!
M	HENRY	Don't worry. He won't.
F	ELSA	Indy, please! Do what he says!
M	HENRY	And don't listen to her!
M	VOGEL	Enough! She diesl
M	INDY	Wait! Waitl
F	ELSA	I'm sorry.
M	INDY	No, don't be.
F	ELSA	But you should have listened to your father.
M	INDY	She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
M	HENRY	Umh?
M	INDY	How did you she was a Nazi?
M	HENRY	She talks in her sleep.
M	HENRY	I didn't trust her. Why did you?
M	MAN IN CHAIR	Because he didn't take my advice.
M	INDY	Donovan
F	DONOVAN	Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
M	HENRY	I misjudged you WalterI knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase. But I didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
F	DONOVAN	Doctor Schneider There're pages torn out of thisl
F	ELSA	This book contained a mapa map with no namesprecise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
M	INDY	So it did.
F	DONOVAN	Where are these missing pages? This maps we must have these pages backs
F	ELSA	You're wasting your breath. He won't tell us. And he doesn't have to... it's perfectly obvious where the pages are... ... he's given them to Marcus Brody.
M	HENRY	Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you? He's not up to the challenge.
F	DONOVAN	He sticks out like a sore thumb. We'll find him.
M	INDY	The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs. Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already.
M	BRODY	Does anyone here speak English? Or even ancient Greek?
M	BRODY	No water, no thank you. No, fish make love in it.
M	BRODY	Thank you so much. No, I don't like that. No, I really don't want... No, no, thank you very much. No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.
M	BRODY	Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?
M	SALLAH	Mister Brodyl
M	BRODY	Oh, Sallahl What a relief!
M	SALLAH	Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
M	BRODY	Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
M	SALLAH	You are on your own?
M	BRODY	Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you. . .have you arranged our supplies?
M	SALLAH	Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
M	BRODY	Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
M	SINISTER MAN	Mister Brody?
M	SINISTER MAN	Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.
M	BRODY	Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
M	SALLAH	And I am his.
M	SINISTER MAN	Follow me, please.
M	BRODY	My reputation precedes me.
M	SALLAH	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
M	SECOND MAN	Papers please.
M	SALLAH	Papers? Of course.
M	SALLAH	Run.
M	BRODY	Yes.
M	SALLAH	Papers, sir. Got it here.
M	SALLAH	Just finished reading it myself. Run!
M	BRODY	Yes.
M	SALLAH	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run!
M	BRODY	Did you say...? Uh, uh...
M	SALLAH	Run!
M	SALLAH	Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that door!
M	HENRY	Intolerable.
M	VOGEL	Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
F	ELSA	So?
M	VOGEL	Your presence on the platform is requested... at the highest level.
F	ELSA	Thank you, Herr Oberst. I will meet you at Iskenderun.
F	DONOVAN	Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin. It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. Without a map, I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.
M	VOGEL	Let me kill them now.
F	ELSA	No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive.
F	DONOVAN	Always do what the doctor orders.
F	ELSA	Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same.
M	INDY	I'm sorry you think so.
F	ELSA	I can't forget... how wonderful it was.
M	HENRY	Thank you. It was rather wonderful.
M	VOGEL	Doctor Schneider! Your car is waiting.
F	ELSA	That's how Austrians say goodbye.
M	VOGEL	And this is how we say goodbye in Germany, Doctor Jones.
M	HENRY	Ohh. . .
M	INDY	Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
M	HENRY	So did I.
M	INDY	Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
M	HENRY	You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
M	INDY	Are you kidding?I made that up! You know Marcushe got lost once in his own museum!
M	INDY	Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?
M	HENRY	What am I looking for?
M	INDY	My lucky charm.
M	HENRY	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
M	INDY	Try and burn through the ropes.
M	HENRY	Very good.
M	HENRY	I ought to tell you something.
M	INDY	Don't get sentimental now Dad save it 'til we get out of here.
M	HENRY	The floor's on fire! See?!
M	INDY	What???
M	HENRY	And the chair.
M	INDY	All right, movel Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
M	LIEUTENANT	Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.
F	DONOVAN	Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more important, we have the map.
M	RADIO OPERATOR	Aus Berlin, mein Herr.
F	DONOVAN	"By the personal command of the Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. Eliminate the American conspirators." Germany has declared war on the Jones boys. Los fahren.
M	INDY	Dad!
M	HENRY	What?
M	INDY	Dad!
M	HENRY	What?
M	INDY	Dad!
M	HENRY	What?
M	INDY	Head for the fireplace!
M	HENRY	Oh.
M	INDY	I think I can get these ropes off.
M	INDY	Whoopsl
M	HENRY	Our situation has not improved.
M	INDY	Listen Dad... I'm almost free.
M	WOMAN	Alarm!
M	WOMAN	Schnel!!
M	HENRY	This is intolerable!
M	INDY	I'm out, Dad!
M	HENRY	Well done, boy!
M	INDY	Come on Dad.
M	INDY	Dead end.
M	INDY	There's got to be a... a secret door around. A passageway or something.
M	HENRY	I find that if I just sit down and think...
M	INDY	Dad!
M	HENRY	... the solution presents itself.
M	INDY	Great. More boats.
M	HENRY	Would you say this has been just another typical day for you? Huh?
M	INDY	Ooofl No! It's been better than most.
M	INDY	Come on, Dad. Come onl
M	HENRY	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
M	VOGEL	Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!
M	INDY	Ha!
M	GUARD	Halt! Halt!
M	HENRY	Stop!
M	INDY	What?
M	HENRY	Stop! Stop!
M	HENRY	You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
M	INDY	Brody's this way.
M	HENRY	My Diary's in Berlin.
M	INDY	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
M	HENRY	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
M	INDY	All right Dadtell me.
M	HENRY	Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
M	INDY	What final challenge?
M	HENRY	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
M	INDY	Booby traps?
M	HENRY	Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
M	INDY	But what are they? Can't you remember?
M	HENRY	I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember
M	INDY	Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
M	HENRY	Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
M	INDY	What about Marcus?
M	HENRY	Marcus would agree with me.
M	INDY	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christl
M	HENRY	That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
M	INDY	This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
M	HENRY	Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
M	HENRY	My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land.
M	INDY	Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?
F	ELSA	How did you get here?
M	INDY	Where is it? I want it.
F	ELSA	You came back for the book? Whv?
M	INDY	My father didn't want it incinerated.
F	ELSA	Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
M	INDY	Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think?
F	ELSA	You do.
M	INDY	All I have to do is squeeze.
F	ELSA	All I have to do is scream.
M	INDY	I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.
M	HENRY	What did you get?
M	INDY	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
M	HENRY	Good.
M	INDY	Well, we made it.
M	HENRY	When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
M	INDY	Relax. rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.
M	VOGEL	Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!
M	VOGEL	Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?
M	FEMALE PASSENGER	Nein. Fahrscheine, bitte.
M	MALE PASSENGER	Nein.
M	MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)	Ich habe ihn night gesehen.
M	INDY	Tickets please.
M	INDY	Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.
M	VOGEL	Guten Tag, Herr Jones.
M	INDY	Fahrscheine meine Herr.
M	VOGEL	Weg.
M	INDY	Tickets please.
M	VOGEL	Was?
M	INDY	No ticket.
M	VOGEL	Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!
M	HENRY	You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
M	INDY	That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather!
M	HENRY	Well, I'm as human as the next man.
M	INDY	I was the next man.
M	HENRY	Ships that pass in the night...
M	INDY	Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
M	HENRY	Hmmm... What did we talk about?
M	INDY	We didn't talk. We never talked.
M	HENRY	And do I detect a rebuke?
M	INDY	A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
M	HENRY	Actually, I was a wonderful father.
M	INDY	When?
M	HENRY	Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- reliance. What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
M	HENRY	You left just when you were becoming interesting.
M	INDY	Dad, how can you --?
M	HENRY	Very well. I'm here now.
M	HENRY	What do you want to talk about? Hmmm?
M	INDY	Well... I can't think of anything.
M	HENRY	Then what are you complaining about? Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges. "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. "
M	INDY	What does that mean?
M	HENRY	I don't know. We'll find out.
M	INDY	They're turning around. They're taking us back to Germany.
M	INDY	Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!
M	INDY	Come on, Dad. Come on!
M	HENRY	I didn't know you could fly a plane.
M	INDY	Fly--yes. Land--no. TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS
M	INDY	Dad, you're gonna have to use the machine gun. Get it ready.
M	INDY	Eleven o'clock!
M	INDY	Dadeleven o'clock!!
M	HENRY	What happens at eleven o'clock?
M	INDY	Twelveeleventen. Eleven o'clock. Fire!
M	INDY	Dad, are we hit?!
M	HENRY	More or less.
M	HENRY	Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
M	INDY	Hang on, Dads We're going in!
M	HENRY	Nice landing.
M	INDY	Thanks.
M	HENRY	Those people are trying to kill us!
M	INDY	I know, Dadl
M	HENRY	It's a new experience for me.
M	INDY	It happens to me all the time.
M	HENRY	This is intolerable!
M	INDY	This could be close.
M	HENRY	Faster, boy --faster!
M	HENRY	Well, they don't come any closer than that!
M	INDY	Dad, he's coming back.
M	HENRY	I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. "Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky."
F	DONOVAN	These pages are taken from Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness. And they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail.
F	DONOVAN	As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands. However, Your Highness, we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission, nor of removing the Grail from your borders without suitable compensation.
M	SULTAN	What have you brought?
M	VOGEL	Bring den Schatzl
F	DONOVAN	Precious valuables, Your Highness, "donated" by some of the finest families in all of Germany.
M	SULTAN	Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3 litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder engine, with Stromberg Downdraft carburetor.
M	SULTAN	Can go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I even like the color.
F	DONOVAN	The keys are in the ignition, Your Highness.
M	SULTAN	You shall have camels, horses, an armed escort, provisions, desert vehiclesand tanksl
F	DONOVAN	You're welcome.
F	ELSA	We have no time to lose. Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.
M	SALLAH	We go this way.
M	SALLAH	Get that camel out of the way!
M	INDY	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
M	SALLAH	Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
M	HENRY	Now they have the map! And in this sort of race, there's no silver medal for finishing second.
F	DONOVAN	Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
M	BRODY	I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
M	VOGEL	We must be within three or four miles. Otherwise we are off the map.
F	DONOVAN	Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
M	BRODY	You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
M	INDY	Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun.
M	HENRY	What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
M	INDY	Dad, we're well out of range.
M	SALLAH	That car belonged to my brother- in-law.
M	INDY	Come on--come on!
M	VOGEL	I can't see anyone up there.
F	DONOVAN	Maybe it wasn't even Jones.
F	ELSA	No. It's him all right. He's here somewhere.
F	DONOVAN	Put Brody in the tank.
F	DONOVAN	Well, in this sun, without transportation, they're as good as dead.
F	DONOVAN	It's Jones, all right.
M	HENRY	Now, who are all these people?
M	INDY	Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
M	INDY	I'm going after those horses.
M	SALLAH	I'll take the camels.
M	INDY	I don't need camels.
M	SALLAH	But, Indy
M	INDY	No camels!
F	DONOVAN	Who is he?
M	KAZIM	A messenger from God. For the unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation.
M	HENRY	Marcus!
M	BRODY	Arghhh! Oh!
M	HENRY	"Genius of the Restoration"
M	BRODY	"aid our own resuscitation!"
M	BRODY	Henryl What are you doing here?!
M	HENRY	It's a rescue, old boys Come on.
M	VOGEL	Search him.
M	VOGEL	What is in this book? That miserable little Diary of yours!
M	VOGEL	Here's the map. The book is useless, and yet you come all the way back to Berlin to get it. Why?
M	VOGEL	What are you hiding?
M	VOGEL	What does the Diary tell you that it doesn't tell us?!
M	HENRY	It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them.
F	DONOVAN	Colonel? Jones is getting away.
M	VOGEL	I think not, Herr Donovan.
F	DONOVAN	Not that Jonesthe other Jones!
M	NAZI SOLDIER	Herr Colonel!
M	INDY	Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
M	SALLAH	Compensation for my brother-in- law's car. Indy, your father and Brody
M	INDY	Where's my father?
M	SALLAH	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
M	VOGEL	Fire!
M	VOGEL	Der Kubelwagon sprengen!
M	NAZI SOLDIER	Keine Bewegung.
M	NAZI SOLDIER	Keine Bewegung.
M	INDY	Dad! Dad! Dad!
M	HENRY	Junior? Junior? Junior!
M	INDY	Dad!
M	INDY	Dad! Dadl Get it!
M	PERISCOPE SOLDIER	Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie Weiber.
M	BRODY	Henry, the pen
M	HENRY	What?
M	BRODY	But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
M	BRODY	Look what you didl
M	HENRY	It's war.
M	HENRY	Didn't I tell you it was a rescue, huh?
M	INDY	Dad?
M	HENRY	You call this archaeology?
M	INDY	Get out of there, Dad!
M	BRODY	How does one get off this thing?
M	HENRY	Where's Marcus?!
M	INDY	Dad!
M	INDY	Hang on, Dad!
M	SALLAH	Father of Indygive me your hand!
M	INDY	Sallah! Get Dadl
M	SALLAH	Give me your hand!
M	HENRY	Junior?!
M	SALLAH	Indy?!
M	HENRY	Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough.
M	HENRY	I thought I'd lost you, boy.
M	INDY	I thought you had too, sir.
M	HENRY	Wellwell done! Come on!
M	HENRY	Let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? Come on let's go!
F	DONOVAN	The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
F	DONOVAN	Helmut, another volunteer!
F	ELSA	I never expected to see you again.
M	INDY	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
F	DONOVAN	Step back now, Doctor Schneider. Give Doctor Jones some room. He's going to recover the Grail for us.
F	DONOVAN	Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
M	INDY	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
F	DONOVAN	Nazis?!Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo. The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
M	INDY	Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
F	DONOVAN	You know something, Doctor Jones?... you're absolutely right.
M	INDY	Dad?!
M	HENRY	Junior. . .
F	ELSA	No!!
F	DONOVAN	Get back!
F	DONOVAN	You can't save him when you're dead.
F	DONOVAN	The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now. It's time to ask yourself what you believe.
M	INDY	"The Breath of God... Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass. . . "
M	INDY	"The penitent man will pass. The penitent man..."
M	HENRY	"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
M	INDY	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
M	HENRY	The penitent man. The penitent... The penitent man is humble before God.
M	HENRY	Penitent. Penitent...
M	INDY	The penitent man is humble...
M	INDY	He kneels before God. Kneel!!
M	INDY	I'm through!
F	DONOVAN	We're through!
M	SALLAH	He's all right.
M	HENRY	No.
M	INDY	"The second challenge is the Word of God. Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed." The Word of God... The Word of...
M	INDY	"Proceed in the footsteps of the Word." HENRY
M	HENRY	The Word of God...
M	BRODY	No, Henry. Try not to talk. The Name of God...
M	INDY	The Name of God... Jehovahl
M	HENRY	But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I." "J."
M	HENRY	Oh dear!
M	INDY	In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with an "I." "I"...
M	INDY	"E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...
M	INDY	"The path of flood. Only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
M	INDY	Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!
M	BRODY	Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
M	INDY	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
M	HENRY	You must believe, boy. you must... believe.
M	KNIGHT	I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
M	INDY	Who are you?
M	KNIGHT	The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
M	INDY	That was seven hundred years ago.
M	KNIGHT	A long time to wait.
M	KNIGHT	You're strangely dressed...for a knight.
M	INDY	I'm not exactly...a knight. What do you mean?
M	KNIGHT	I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
M	INDY	Listen, I don't have time to explain, but
F	DONOVAN	Which one is it?
M	KNIGHT	You must choose. But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life the False Grail will take it from you.
F	DONOVAN	I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it?
F	ELSA	Let me choose.
F	DONOVAN	Thank you, Doctor.
F	DONOVAN	Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.
F	DONOVAN	Eternal life!
F	DONOVAN	What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .?
F	DONOVAN	What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?
M	KNIGHT	He chose...poorly.
F	ELSA	It would not be made out of gold.
M	INDY	That's the cup of a carpenter.
M	INDY	There's only one way to find out.
M	KNIGHT	You have chosen wisely. But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. That is the boundary and the price of immortality.
M	SALLAH	Drop your guns. Please.
M	INDY	Dad, come on. Get to your feet.
F	ELSA	We have got it. Come on.
M	INDY	Elsa! Elsa, don't movel
F	ELSA	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
M	INDY	Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
M	HENRY	Junior! Junior!
M	INDY	Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
F	ELSA	I can reach it. I can reach it...
M	INDY	Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me your other hand!
M	INDY	Elsa!!
M	HENRY	Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
M	INDY	I can get itI can almost reach it, Dad.
M	HENRY	Indiana. Indiana!!
M	HENRY	... let it go...
M	INDY	Dad. . . Please, Dad...
M	HENRY	Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
M	INDY	What did vou find, Dad?
M	HENRY	Me?... Illumination.
M	HENRY	What did you find, Junior?
M	INDY	Junior?! Dad... Please...What does it always mean, this...this "Junior?"
M	HENRY	That's his name. Henry Jones, Junior.
M	INDY	I like Indiana.
M	HENRY	We named the dog Indiana.
M	BRODY	May we go home now, please? The dog!? You are named after the dog...
M	INDY	I've got a lot of fond memories of that dog.
M	INDY	Ready?
M	HENRY	Ready.
M	BRODY	Indy! Henryl Follow met I know the way! Haaa!
M	HENRY	Got lost in his own museum, huh?
M	INDY	Uh-huh.
M	HENRY	After you, Junior.
M	INDY	Yes, sir! Haaa!
