M	STEWART	
M		wanted her to give him some money."
M	WALLER	Put your hand up! I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!
M	STEWART	morning, gels.
M	STEWART	Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.
M		am actually from England, Miss Stewart.
M	STEWART	course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.
M	STEWART	travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.
M	WALLER	can sit over here, Juliet. Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives Juliet a cardboard name card.
M	WALLER	use French names in this class. You can choose your own. Waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing.
M	WALLER	irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .
M		me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake.
M		doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.
M	WALLER	is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "Antoinette."
M		should have written "vint." Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word.
M	WALLER	mumble) Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.
M		don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it.
M	WALLER	teacher, MRS. COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. She starts to distribute them around the tables.
M	COLLINS	I thought we'd do some life drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.
M	COLLINS	Juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.
M		s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one. Collins scans the class.
M	COLLINS	. . . are you with anybody?
M	COLLINS	You can come here and pair up with Juliet.
M	COLLINS	might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, Joan.
M	COLLINS	heavens, Juliet! What on earth is this???
M		George and the Dragon.
M	COLLINS	Pauline?
M		I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room.
M		I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!
M	COLLINS	I know it's very clever, Juliet, but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down and start again!
M		
M		. . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.
M		have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
M		shoves his hand away.
M		think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
M		as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
M		me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?
M		partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?
M		Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.
M		at his album.
M		have been splashing out!
M		Oh! . . . I've got my board money . . .
M		starts fishing in his pockets.
M		
M		Tell us! How'd it go? disappears into the lounge.
M		with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
M		worry about it now. We'll sort it out after dinner. You go put your record on.
M		Day!
M		I think she's very talented!
M		Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!
M		
M		
M		it! You're spoiling it! Go away! is the Phys Ed period and the 31 other girls of 3A are lying on their backs in the quad doing leg stretches to tinny music. MRS. ZWARTZ, the teacher, is patrolling the rows of flexing bodies.
M		I have another look?
M		so impressive!
M		
M		was in bed for months during the war, ravaged by respiratory illness.
M		Mummy and Daddy sent me to the Bahamas to recuperate. I didn't see them for five years-but we're together now and Mummy's promised they'll never leave me again.
F	HONORA	over her, looking very concerned.
M		
M		turns your bones to chalk. It took them two years to drain all the muck out.
M		up! All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases! It's all frightfully romantic!
M		Paul!
M		
M		evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get him, Paul!
M		blighter's gone to ground!
M		Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!
M		God . . . I'm so sorry!
M		
M		course it matters! It's Mario!
M		
M		broke Paul's record!
M		must buy her another one!
M		thank you. Well, Juliet's told us all about you. I hear you're fond of opera.
M		one shall we play?
M		can study while we're playing records! Why don't you go back outside, mmm? I'll be finished soon.
M		Paul? Oh, God! Paul . . . are you all right?
M		
M		
M		
M		You've been eating onions.
M		toad!
M		"There's a light in her eye, Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a light in her eye."
M		"Her face is a dream, like an angel I saw . . .
M		
F	JULIET	"But all that my darling can scream . . ." . . then break down into convulsive laughter. They turn and flee back into the bushes.
M		I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
M		says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
M		we're all going to Heaven!
M		not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
M		an absolute Paradise of music, art and enjoyment.
M		will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
M		
M		be known as He!
M		. . .
M		
M		. . .
M		
M		. . .
M		
M		. . .
M		
M		not! Orson Welles! The most hideous man alive!
M		give praise to . . . the saints! over.
M		it's all right. It's from Whitcomb and Tombs . . .
M		V.O.) I decided that my New Year's resolution is to be more lenient with others. Bayliss wanders in.
M		Pikelets! Yum!
M		
M		Not till two-thirty . . .
M		is a private function! Go away!
M		retreats, hurt and confused. HONORA in a plate of scones.
M		on! Sausage rolls.
M		
M		Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
M		who I've found!
M		off her pinny as HERBERT Juliet into the dining room.
M		Juliet.
M		Mrs. Rieper . . . it's so nice to meet you.
M		so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
M		HERBERT a glance. HONORA at Juliet.
M		heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
M		actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
M		sound like a queer mob!
M		
M		wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
M		no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
M		She has deep discussions with unhappy couples and persuades them to have another go at it. In two years, she's only had four divorces. She should really be working for the U.N.!
M		
M		that?
M		not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
M		a glance. up.
M		up, Yvonne.
M		
M		at Juliet.
M		tells us you're good at making models.
M		adore anything to do with the arts.
M		pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
M		never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
M		you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT his head.
M		work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
M		the manager!
M		a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
M		
M		excuse us.
M		Breakfast is between seven and nine . . . the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and comfortable.
M		
M		Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
M		Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
M		Pauline and Juliet look at each with knowing smiles.
M		
M		V.O.) . . . but we hope the book will help them to do so a little, though no one could fully appreciate us.
M		clutches his wounded shoulder as he gallops into the courtyard.
M		awaits his return in their private boudoir at the very top of the tower.
M		smells her scent from 50 paces and urges his steed onward!
M		flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
M		yes!
M		I bet she gets up the duff on their first night together!
M		you wouldn't understand. launches himself at Juliet, and they roll on the sand, grappling.
M		eight and a half and incredibly stupid!
M		. . . Pauline and I have decided the Charles and Deborah are going to have a baby. An heir to the throne of Borovnia.
M		calling him Diello.
M		thought it up.
M		
M		
M		I should go, too!
M		Hilda suddenly stands.
M		Julie! Julie!
M		Paul!
M		
M		so beautiful!
M		light streams on Pauline and Juliet. Pauline look up as the clouds above them open. Juliet stands as if in trance. She offers her hand to Pauline.
M		with me.
M		V.O.) Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We then realised we had the key . . .
M		V0.) We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10 people have it. On two days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of . . .
M		
M		. . . Breathe! . . . It's coming! . . . Oh, God!
M		a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!
M		shall call him Diello.
M		such an incredible woman.
M		couldn't have done it without you, Charles. is presiding over Form 4A.
M		. . the Empress Deborah has the difficulty fending off her husband, who tries his way with her morning, noon and night . . . s glare deters them.
M	STEVE	
M		. . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . .
M	STEVE	That's enough, Juliet! rips the essay out of her hand and waves it under her nose. I suppose this is your idea of a joke?
M		
M	STEVE	I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish!
M		not rubbish!
M	STEVE	Sit down, Pauline!
M		really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested.
M		doesn't say it has to be the Windsors! (Yelling) Sit down!
M	STEVE	(To Juliet) A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat!
M	starts coughing. Mrs. STEVE	face darkens.
M	STEVE	Stop it, Juliet!
M		
M		
M		in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
M		on, sit up.
M		not hungry.
M		got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
M		just want to be on my own for a while.
M		to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
M		may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
M		up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
M		you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
M		infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
M		she'll have no one to look after her!
M		parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
M		Juliet won't be allowed visitors for at least a couple of months.
M		booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
M		a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT at Pauline.
M		I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
M		used to love making things with Dad, Yvonne.
M		
M		V.O.) I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a two-page letter as Paul.
M		V.O.) She has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!
M		
M		V.O.) Although only 10, Diello has thus far killed 57 people and shows no desire to stop . . . it worries me, Charles.
M		
M		V.O.) I have to report that the lower classes are terrifically dull.
M		V.O.) Only yesterday I was compelled to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom . . .
M		V.O.) . . . Diello insisted on coming along . . . in fact, he made such a fuss that I had to let him yield the ax himself. Heads did roll! Not just the prisoners, but the royal guard, my valet and several unfortunate copped it as well . . .
M		V.O.) Oh, Charles . . . I am despair enough to put Diello in the hands of the Cardinal, in hope that a good dose of religion will set the young chap on the right path. behind her. Within sight of the dayroom, Pauline breaks into a run, nearly bowling a NURSE over.
M		
M		so happy to see you!
M		over.
M		best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
M		you so much!
M		coming along well!
M		
M		love the colour!
M		for you. looking at some mail on a small table. Pauline is sitting at Juliet's bedside.
M		me! What a lot of letters. Are your parents enjoying their trip? Oh . . . there's a couple of unopened ones, dear.
M		
M		her a sympathetic look.
M		know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
M		
M		startled at the outburst.
M		sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
M		don't want to tire you out, dear.
M		and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
M		you stay a bit longer, Paul?
M		got a tram to catch, Yvonne.
M		but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy. gestures to a Plasticine GINA figure that is sitting or the shelf.
M		made it! smiles.
M		yes! It's all worked out!
M		
M		
M		has fallen in love with me!
M		idiot boarder?
M		do you know? Did he tell you?
M		. . . no. But it's so obvious.
M		
M		silly. I'm just teasing. He's only a stupid boy!
M		want?
M		
M		should have worn your slippers. Come on, Yvonne, I'll catch me death!
M		for a minute.
M		
M		voice) "Now, gels . . . it isn't ooo, it's eee," and she goes . . . "eeeeee" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her! Silly old trout!
M		then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . . (Squawky voice) "And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these thing do happen . . ." (Normal voice) God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history!
M		course, my darling Nicholas.
M		like Nicholas much better! climbs on top of Pauline.
M		are you doing?
M		hell! in the doorway. He surveys the situation with a grim expression.
M		to the house. scuttles out of the sleepout. Pauline lies still in bed, peering at her father.
M		
M		and leaves the room. Pauline stares at the ceiling.
M		thunderous and stomps off.
M		
M	PULLS BACK to reveal STEVE	Ross, a new boarder, LAURIE, and HERBERT around the table. The boarders are clearly oblivious to the tense family vibes.
M		his head, sullenly.
M		in the doorway.
M		no longer staying here. looks surprised. up, glowering at her daughter.
M		
M		
M		If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
M		
M		I go now?
M		Pauline by the shoulders.
M		think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night!
M		God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
M		I guess I take after you then!
M		around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
M		ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
M		back.
M		You're going to be late.
M		V.O.) I am terribly cut up. I miss Nicholas terrifically. Mother thinks I will have nothing more to do with him, but little she knows . . .
M		
M		V.O.) We sat around and talked for an hour and then went to bed. I declined the invitation at first, but he became very masterful and I had no option. I discovered that I had not lost my virginity on Thursday night. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that I have now . . .
M		
M		
M		
M		
M		got to go home. jumps out of bed and wraps his arms around her.
M		V.O.) There are living among two dutiful daughters.
M		
M		V.O.) You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The sweet soothingness of their caress,
M		
M		
M		V.O.) Compared with these two, every man is a fool,/The world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/And I worship the power of these lovely two,/ With that adoring love known to so few . . .
M		V.O.) 'Tis indeed a miracle, one must feel, That two such heavenly creatures are real,
M		V.O.) Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,
M		V.O.) Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not realise,
M		
M		
M		standing, holding the door open, looking rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.
M		sitting in the lounge. Henry looking rather uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. HERBERT at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle.
M		pouring a drink.
M		I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme? No, thank you. The thing is . . .
M		hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
M		down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
M		arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
M		at Henry.
M		pauses for a moment.
M		She hasn't done anything . . . it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me. I think we should avert trouble before it starts. sitting next to Pauline.
M		Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.
M		
M		the room.
M		
M		nags me. BENNETT And that's why you like to stay with the Hulmes?
M		
M		silly.
M		
M		up from her chair.
M		in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK PATIENTS.
M		horrified.
M		she's always been such a normal, happy child.
M		what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot of weight . . .
M		the kitchen. HERBERT by and goes through the adjoining door into the lounge. He sits down and opens the paper. Wendy is attempting to t the fire. The family are chatting to each other, but we do not hear their conversation because . . .
M		V.O.) Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . .
M		V.O.) l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome.
M		a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA at her with concern.
M		
M		leg . . . have you got pain? shakes her head. She rips open a present . . . a new diary.
M		V.O.) My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."
M		in, waving a letter.
M		arrived today, Yvonne . . .
M		name is Gina!
M		a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
M		does old Stew want?
M		says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
M		cares!
M		care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
M		educating myself!
M		failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE doing my own writing!
M		up an exercise book from a large pile.
M		stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
M		
M		very angry.
M		rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
M		
M		out of the room and slams the door.
M		think I'm going crazy.
M		you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
M		go overseas . . .
M		mean travel by ourselves?
M		shall we go? Not the Bahamas; it's bloody awful!
M		
M		I know . . . I'll lean back and put my hair on my shoulders-then I'll look just like Veronica Lake!
M		
M		
M		
M		I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
M		I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
M		They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
M		lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
M		can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
M		great! We'll have the fare in no time!
M		V.O.) I rose at 5:30 this morning and did housework before 8 o'clock, including taking Wendy her breakfast in bed. I feel very pleased with myself on the whole and also the future.
M		
M		hit! Gave his trousers a good soaking! Everyone will think he's peed himself!
M		full) Bloody Bill's sniffing around Mummy something chronic.
M		thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
M		
M		
M		There's something desperately exciting about bodies on stretchers . . . (Regretfully) But it wasn't like that at all!
M		Mother was completely taken in.
M		you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
M		right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
M		
M		
M		washing my hair now, Laurie. Won't be a moment.
M		walking past with an armful of washing.
M		she still in there?
M		harder.
M		
M		of Pauline getting out of the bathwater.
M		(Angry) I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
M		Open this door! berating her. However, we only hear Pauline's V.O. as HONORA her down the corridor.
M		talking to her. to Pauline, soundlessly.
M		V.O.) I rang Deborah immediately as I had to tell someone sympathetic how I loathed Mother.
M		balloon has gone up! What on Earth are you talking about? Mr. Perry is ill . . . I've brought him a cup of tea.
M		try and fob me off! It's going to cost you a hundred pounds, or I'm blabbing to Daddy!
M		
M		It's all arranged . . . we don't need your bloody hundred pounds anyway, so stick it up your bottom!
M		V.O.) Deborah told me the stupendous news! I'm going out to Ilam as we have much to talk over.
M		
M		V.O.) Deborah was still in bed when I arrived. rushes over to the bed. Juliet grabs her and hugs tightly.
M		
M		V.O.) The shock is too great to have penetrated my mind. It is so incredible. Poor Father. Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind and understanding . . .
M		
M		V.O.) What is to be the future now? We may all be going to Italy and dozens of other places, or not all. We none of us know where we are and a good deal depends on chance.
M		V.O.) Dr. Hulme is the noblest and most wonderful person I have ever known of.
M		V.O.) One thing Deborah and I are sticking to: through everything, we sink or swim together.
M		But Daddy, you can't just leave me with Mother!
M		Is Gina coming, too?
M		I'm not going to England without Gina! and Henry exchange an awkward glance.
M		
M		be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
M		belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
M		not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
M		and walks toward the door.
M		talk about this when you've calmed down.
M		at the door. Pauline is slowly rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.
M		V.O.) I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
M		you can still write to each other.
M		touches Pauline's cheek. Pauline winces, averting her face.
M		V.O.) Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die . . .
M		
M		
M		
M		that's not true! I've got one.
M		well in Juliet's eyes.
M		Don't cry, Gina . . . We're not going to be separated. They can't make us . . . they can't!
M		
M		don't be like this, love.
M	gives HONORA	cursory glance and walks past her, up the stairs. HONORA after her, a hurt expression on her face.
M		V.O.) I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.
M		chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA him.
M		just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
M		now?
M		says Juliet's in a terrible state . . . sitting with Hilda in the lounge. a glance. I expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.
M		her head.
M		Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.
M		cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.
M		that a good idea?
M		at HONORA . . tears are running down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.
M		don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme? Yes, of course.
M		Hilda into the hallway.
M		down into heavy sobs.
M		
M		V.O.) Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March hare!
M		V.O.) It was the first time I had ever seen It. Deborah had always told me how hideous he was! and Juliet are sitting in the cinema, absorbed in the film.
M		V.O.) It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . . but I adore him!
M		V.O.) We talked for some time about It, getting ourselves more and more excited.
M		V.O.) We enacted how each saint would make love in bed. heaves on the bed, Pauline leans over and . . . MORPHS into Orson Welles!
M		V.O.) We spent a hectic night going through the saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin.
M		coming with you.
M		. . .
M		know what to do about mother.
M		don't want to go to too much trouble . . . some sort of accident.
M		die every day.
M		
M		V.O.) This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.
M		the best people fight against all obstacles . . .

M		V.O..) I am writing a little of this up on the morning before the death. I felt very excited and the night-before-Christmas-ish last night. I am about to rise.

M		think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

M		had never married. Pauline was therefore charged under her mother's maiden name of Parker. August 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the Christchurch Supreme Court trial and Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were found guilty of murder.

M		Simon O'Connor Well, we went through about 35 or 40 people. We wanted to interview as many people as we could find. Several refused. We talk to about 15 or 16 of their classmates, which was experience. These were 55-year-old women spread out around the country, and they all had changed their names because they'd gotten married. It was quite a detective job to find them. No, the school didn't want anything to do with it. Christchurch Girls' School had erased these two girls from their history. The yearbook that had the class photograph with Pauline is no longer available. If you go to the school library, they have all the yearbooks available apart from 1953's, which has her photo in it. It sort of cleansing of the books. The school didn't recognize what it was we were trying to do, which was to redress the issue. Why wipe these girls off the school records? I mean, they were human beings. I think our understanding when we set out to write this was that we would never be able to re-create the right interiors, with characters who precisely reflect the people who were really there. Our intention was to be true to what we understood of the girls' friendship, and the nature of that to Victoria Park. Were their snide comments about Sir Edmund Hillary in the diary, or were they invented by the two of you? Yeah, we interviewed several people who remembered that they used to model figures in Plasticine, and I think HERBERT refers to it in his court testimony. We also interviewed an old guy who had been round to the Hulme's place and had seen Juliet's Plasticine horses on the mantelpiece.
