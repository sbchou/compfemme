M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	BRIGITTE	You didn't wake me.
M	MICHAEL	You were sleeping.
F	BRIGITTE	You let me sleep because you can't bear to have breakfast with me.
M	MICHAEL	Nothing could be further from the truth. I boiled you an egg. See?
M	MICHAEL	I'd hardly have boiled you an egg if I didn't want to see you. Tea or coffee?
F	BRIGITTE	Does any woman ever stay long enough to find out what the hell goes on in your head?
F	BRIGITTE	What are you doing tonight?
M	MICHAEL	I'm seeing my daughter.
F	BRIGITTE	Your daughter? You've kept very quiet about her.
M	MICHAEL	Have I? She's been abroad for a year. Did you say tea?
F	BRIGITTE	I'm going. Give my love to your daughter.
F	HANNA	Hey. Hey!
F	HANNA	Hey, kid. Hey.
M	MICHAEL	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
F	HANNA	Where do you live?
M	MICHAEL	It's here. I'll be fine now. Thank you.
F	HANNA	Look after yourself.
F	CARLA	I'm worried about him. He looks terrible.
M	PETER	The boy's saying he doesn't need a doctor.
F	EMILY	He does.
M	MICHAEL	I don't need a doctor.
M	PETER	Good then.
F	CARLA	Peter.
M	PETER	We're not going to argue about this. People have to take responsibility for their own lives.
M	DOCTOR	Remind me, how old are you now?
F	CARLA	Michael's fifteen.
M	DOCTOR	It's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed for several months. At least.
F	CARLA	Keep away. He's contagious.
M	DOCTOR	Burn the sheets. Complete isolation. And three months is the minimum.
F	CARLA	How are you feeling?
M	MICHAEL	Better. By the way, I meant to tell you, the day I got ill... a woman helped me. A woman in the street.
F	CARLA	She helped you?
M	MICHAEL	Yes. She brought me home.
F	CARLA	Do you have her address?
F	HANNA	Come in.
M	MICHAEL	I brought you these flowers. To say thank you.
F	HANNA	Put them down there.
M	MICHAEL	I would have come earlier, but I've been in bed for three months.
F	HANNA	You're better now?
M	MICHAEL	Thank you.
F	HANNA	Have you always been weak?
M	MICHAEL	Oh no. I'd never been ill before. It's incredibly boring. There's nothing to do. I couldn't even be bothered to read.
F	HANNA	I have to go to work. I'll walk with you. Wait in the hall while I change.
F	HANNA	There are two more buckets downstairs. You can fill them and bring them up.
F	HANNA	You look ridiculous, look at you, kid.
F	HANNA	You can't go home like that. Give me your clothes, I'll run you a bath.
F	HANNA	What, do you always take a bath in your trousers?
F	HANNA	It's all right, I won't look.
F	HANNA	Wash your hair, I'll get you a towel.
F	HANNA	So. That's why you came back.
M	MICHAEL	You're so incredibly beautiful.
F	HANNA	Now, kid, you know that's not true.
M	PETER	You've inconvenienced your mother.
M	MICHAEL	How many more times? I've said I'm sorry.
M	PETER	You scared her.
M	MICHAEL	It's hardly my fault, I got lost, that's all. That's why I was late. Can I have some more?
F	EMILY	How can anyone get lost in their own home town?
M	MICHAEL	The doctor told me I had to take walks.
F	EMILY	So?
M	MICHAEL	I meant to head for the castle, I ended up at the sports-field.
F	EMILY	They're in opposite directions.
M	MICHAEL	It's none of your business.
F	EMILY	He's lying.
F	CARLA	He's not lying. Michael never lies.
M	MICHAEL	Dad, I've decided, I want to go back to school tomorrow.
F	CARLA	The doctor says you need another three weeks.
M	MICHAEL	Well I'm going.
F	CARLA	Peter?
M	PETER	If he wants to go back, then he must.
F	HANNA	All right, kid, it's not just about you.
M	MICHAEL	What's your name?
F	HANNA	What?
M	MICHAEL	Your name.
F	HANNA	Why do you want to know?
M	MICHAEL	I've been here three times. You haven't told me your name.
F	HANNA	It's Hanna. What's yours, kid?
M	MICHAEL	Michael.
F	HANNA	Michael. Hmm. So I'm with a Michael.
M	MICHAEL	`Hanna'.
M	TEACHER	The notion of secrecy is central to Western literature. You may say the whole idea of character in fiction is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons - sometimes perverse, sometimes noble - they are determined not to disclose.
F	HANNA	You never tell me what you've been studying.
M	MICHAEL	Studying?
F	HANNA	At school. Do you learn languages?
M	MICHAEL	Yes.
F	HANNA	What languages?
M	MICHAEL	Latin.
F	HANNA	Say something in Latin.
M	MICHAEL	Oh...
M	MICHAEL	Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur dexteris aptantur enses conditi?
M	MICHAEL	It's Horace.
F	HANNA	It's wonderful.
M	MICHAEL	Do you want some Greek?
M	MICHAEL	Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon oi da naon phais epi gan malainan emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto tis eratai.
F	HANNA	It's beautiful.
M	MICHAEL	How can you tell? How do you know when you've no idea what it means?
F	HANNA	What about in German?
M	MICHAEL	In German?
F	HANNA	Do you have anything?
M	MICHAEL	Well, I'm writing an essay. It's about a play. By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps you've heard of him?
M	MICHAEL	The play's called Emilia Galotti.
F	HANNA	Have you got it?
M	MICHAEL	Here. You can read it.
F	HANNA	I'd rather listen to you.
M	MICHAEL	All right. I'm not very good.
M	MICHAEL	Act One. Scene One. The setting : one of the prince's chambers. Prince - "Complaints, nothing but complaints, petitions, nothing but petitions. For goodness' sake, just imagine that people actually envy us."
F	HANNA	You're good at it, aren't you?
M	MICHAEL	Good at what?
F	HANNA	Reading.
F	HANNA	Why are you smiling?
M	MICHAEL	Because I didn't think I was good at anything.
M	MICHAEL	What was all that about?
M	MICHAEL	I got up - at 4.30 - specially - it's the first day of the holidays, I'd been planning to surprise you -
F	HANNA	Poor little baby. Got up at four thirty - and on your holidays too.
M	MICHAEL	What is this? I was on your tram! You totally ignored me! What do you think I was doing? Why the hell do you think I was there?
F	HANNA	I haven't the slightest idea. And what you do is your business not mine.
F	HANNA	And if you wanted to speak to me, I was in the first carriage. So why did you sit in the second?
F	HANNA	And now, thanks very much, I've been working, I need a bath. Get out, I'd like to be by myself.
M	MICHAEL	I didn't mean to upset you.
F	HANNA	You don't have the power to upset me. You don't matter enough to upset me.
M	MICHAEL	I don't know what to say. I've never been with a woman. We've been together four weeks and I can't live without you. I can't. Even the thought of it kills me.
M	MICHAEL	I sat in the second carriage because I thought you might kiss me.
F	HANNA	Kid, you thought we could make love in a tram?
M	MICHAEL	Is it true what you said? That I don't matter to you?
M	MICHAEL	Do you forgive me?
M	MICHAEL	Do you love me?
F	HANNA	Do you have a book?
M	MICHAEL	Oh. Well I do. I took something with me this morning.
F	HANNA	What is it?
M	MICHAEL	It's another play.
F	HANNA	We're changing the order we do things. Read to me first, kid. Then we make love.
M	MICHAEL	Intrigue and Love, a play by Friedrich Schiller...
M	MICHAEL	The Odyssey by Homer.
F	HANNA	What's an odyssey?
M	MICHAEL	It's a journey. He sets out on a journey.
M	MICHAEL	"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy. Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home...
M	MICHAEL	"And we will some new pleasures prove of golden sands and crystal brooks, with silken lights and silver hooks..."
F	HANNA	Come here.
M	MICHAEL	I poked into the place aways and encountered a little open patch as big as a bedroom, all hung around with vines and found a man lying there asleep, and by Jinks it was my old Jim... He starts acting out Jim, and the two of them collapse
M	MICHAEL	"Lady Chatterley felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her...
F	HANNA	This is disgusting. Where did you get this?
M	MICHAEL	I borrowed it from someone at school.
F	HANNA	You should be ashamed. Go on.
M	MICHAEL	`Blistering Barnacles and a thundering typhoon. It is water.' `But what on earth did you expect it to be?'
F	HANNA	Whisky.
M	MICHAEL	Whisky! By thunder, whisky. `Whisky? Come now captain, you can't be serious.'
F	HANNA	All right, kid, that's enough for today.
M	MICHAEL	I was wondering, do you think you could get some time off? Maybe we could go for a trip.
F	HANNA	What sort of trip?
M	MICHAEL	I'd love to go bicycling. Just for two days.
M	MICHAEL	I've got a guide-book. I've worked out the route. Look, what do you think?
F	HANNA	I think you like planning, don't you?
M	MICHAEL'S VOICE	"I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. Why should I be? I welcome obstacles, because they'll be like mountains I can fly over to be in your arms. The more I suffer, the more I'll love...
M	MICHAEL'S VOICE	"Danger will only increase my love, it will sharpen it, it will give it spice. I'll be the only angel you need. On this arm, Luise, you will go dancing through life. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say `Only one thing can make a soul complete, and that thing is love.'
M	WAITRESS	So what would you like to have?
M	MICHAEL	What are you having?
F	HANNA	You order. I'll have what you have.
M	BOYS	There's sausages, sausages or sausages. Give it to me, come on, give it here. Let me have a look. You always have the same thing.
M	WAITRESS	I hope your mother was happy.
M	MICHAEL	Thank you. She enjoyed her meal very much.
M	MICHAEL	Here, let me show you where we're going.
F	HANNA	It's OK, kid. I don't want to know.
F	HANNA	What are you doing?
M	MICHAEL	I'm writing a poem. About you.
F	HANNA	Can I hear it?
M	MICHAEL	It's not ready. I'll read it to you one day.
M	GERHARD	You all right, Michael?
M	MICHAEL	I'm fine.
M	GERHARD	You'd better hurry. You know what she's like.
F	SOPHIE	I'm just going to pretend I've been here for years, I'm not going to behave in any special way.
M	GIRL	You just wait. You wait and see.
M	TEACHER	Good morning, ladies. Gentlemen, please welcome your new fellow- students, treat them with courtesy, please.
F	SOPHIE	Hello. My name's Sophie.
M	MICHAEL	I'm Michael.
M	TEACHER	Everyone believes that Homer's subject is homecoming. In fact, The Odyssey is a book about a journey. Home is a place you dream of, it's not a place you ever attain.
M	TEACHER	Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but we're meant to studying Homer, not studying Sophia.
M	HOLGER	Michael the water's fantastic.
M	MICHAEL	It's wonderful, isn't it?
M	HOLGER	Wonderful. It's going to be a great summer.
M	HOLGER	Now the Americans have allowed us back in our own lake.
F	SOPHIE	Why are they so loud?
M	HOLGER	You should see their stores. They have everything.
M	MICHAEL	Oh sure. Everything mankind could ever dream of.
F	SOPHIE	You don't like Americans?
M	MICHAEL	Just it's more fun without them.
F	SOPHIE	Why do you leave early?
M	HOLGER	He always leaves early.
M	MICHAEL	I'm sorry I'm late. I was held up at school.
M	MICHAEL	The Lady with the Little Dog. By Anton Chekhov.
M	MICHAEL	"The talk was that a new face had appeared on the promenade, a lady with a little dog."
M	SUPERVISER	Schmitz, one moment. We've got good news for you. Your work is good, we're going to promote you. To work with me in the office. It's more money. Congratulations.
M	HOLGER	Get a move on, we're leaving early today.
M	MICHAEL	Why? What for?
M	HOLGER	We're going back to Sophie's. It's your birthday. We're giving you a party.
F	SOPHIE	Come on, it's a surprise. We thought you'd like it. We've been planning it for weeks.
M	MICHAEL	I'm sorry. Really. I promised someone I'd do something else.
F	HANNA	Oh kid, kid. Stop.
M	MICHAEL	What's wrong?
F	HANNA	Nothing's wrong. It's nothing.
M	MICHAEL	You never ask, you never bother to ask how I am.
F	HANNA	You never say.
M	MICHAEL	It just happens to be my birthday. It's my birthday, that's all. In fact, you've never even asked when it is.
F	HANNA	Look if you want a fight, kid...
M	MICHAEL	No, I don't want a fight. What's wrong with you?
F	HANNA	What business is it of yours?
M	MICHAEL	It's always on your terms. Everything. We do what you want. It's always what you want. My friends were giving me a party!
F	HANNA	Well then why are you here? Go back to your party. Isn't that what you want?
M	MICHAEL	And it's always me that has to apologize.
F	HANNA	You don't have to apologize. No-one has to apologize. No-one can make you.
F	HANNA	War and Peace, kid.
F	HANNA	Now you must go back to your friends.
F	SOPHIE	Michael. You all right?
F	EMILY	It's him.
F	CARLA	Where were you last night? What happened?
M	MICHAEL	I stayed at a friend's.
M	PETER	Carla.
M	PETER	Get the boy something to eat. I think we all knew you'd come back to us eventually.
M	ASSISTANT	Mr Berg. It is eight o'clock. Your daughter.
M	MICHAEL	Thank you.
F	JULIA	I was early.
M	MICHAEL	Julia.
M	MICHAEL	Welcome back.
M	MICHAEL	So how will you decide?
F	JULIA	I don't know. I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.
M	MICHAEL	You've seen your mother?
F	JULIA	I wanted to get away. There was nothing more to it. It was Paris, but it could have been anywhere.
M	MICHAEL	Away from your parents?
M	MICHAEL	I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't always open with you. I'm not open with anyone.
F	JULIA	I knew you were distant. I'd always assumed it was my fault.
M	MICHAEL	Julia. How wrong can you be?
M	MICHAEL	I admit it now, I was nervous.
F	JULIA	I was nervous too. It's silly isn't it?
M	MICHAEL	It is silly.
F	JULIA	Thank you for dinner.
M	MICHAEL	I'll see you very soon.
F	JULIA	Good night, Dad.
M	MICHAEL	Julia, wait. I want to ask you a favour.
F	JULIA	What favour?
M	MICHAEL	I want to take you on a trip. I want to show you something.
F	JULIA	When?
M	MICHAEL	Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up in the car?
M	MICHAEL	At ten, say.
M	MICHAEL	Then good.
M	LECTURER	Those of you for the special seminar group on The Legal System in the Third Reich, please stay on in this room. Professor Rohl will be here in a moment.
M	ROHL	Well, we seem to be quite a small group. A small group and a select one. Clearly, this is going to be a unique seminar. Let me start by thanking those of you who've chosen to take part. Good for you. A reading list, gentlemen. Karl Jaspers, The Question of German Guilt...
F	MARTHE	And ladies.
F	MARTHE	So this is where you are.
M	MICHAEL	Yes. Come in.
F	MARTHE	You take work seriously.
M	MICHAEL	Oh I don't know.
F	MARTHE	You're rather a serious boy.
M	MICHAEL	It's how I was brought up. What about you? Are you serious?
F	MARTHE	You're sure you want to work tonight?
M	MICHAEL	Well I do. But I won't work every night.
F	MARTHE	See you tomorrow.
M	MICHAEL	Why all the police?
M	ROHL	They're worried about demonstrators.
M	MICHAEL	For or against?
M	ROHL	Both.
M	CLERK	All photographers are now asked to leave.
F	JUDGE	The defendants, please.
F	JUDGE	The first thing I'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers. They're going to be arguing that there's no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial.
F	JUDGE	I am going to take these cases one by one.
M	MICHAEL	Do you want a pen?
F	MARTHE	I've got a pen.
F	JUDGE	Hanna Schmitz.
F	JUDGE	Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	Can you speak louder please?
F	HANNA	My name is Hanna Schmitz.
F	JUDGE	Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	You joined the SS in 1943?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	What was your reason? What was your reason for joining?
F	JUDGE	You were working at the Siemens factory at the time?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	You'd recently been offered a promotion. Why did you prefer to join the SS?
F	JUDGE	I'll re-phrase my question. I'm trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely. Of her own free will.
F	JUDGE	Well?
F	HANNA	I heard there were jobs.
F	JUDGE	Go on.
F	HANNA	I was working at Siemens when I heard the SS was recruiting.
F	JUDGE	Did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do?
F	HANNA	They were looking for guards. I applied for a job.
F	JUDGE	And you worked first at Auschwitz?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	Until 1944. Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow?
F	HANNA	Yes.
M	ROHL	Are you OK?
M	MICHAEL	I'm fine.
F	JUDGE	You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?
M	ROHL	So what did you think? I don't know. It wasn't quite what I expecting.
M	ROHL	Wasn't it? In what way? What were you expecting?
M	DIETER	I thought it was exciting.
M	ROHL	Exciting?
M	DIETER	Yes.
M	ROHL	Why? Why did you think it exciting?
M	DIETER	Because it's justice.
M	ROHL	I need to correct an impression. Dieter said yesterday this was about justice. But is it? If it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long? The war ended twenty years ago. Remember, there've been no significant trials between Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz trials a couple of years ago. That's a long gap. What's the reason for the gap?
M	DIETER	I'd have thought it was obvious.
M	ROHL	Say.
M	DIETER	Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't it? It's bad conscience. It's the big cover-up.
M	ROHL	Go on.
M	DIETER	After the war. The German people didn't want to look at what they'd done.
M	ROHL	Is that right?
M	DIETER	Because they had too much to hide. All our parents are liars. All right, mine are. So it's left to us, isn't it?
M	ROHL	How so?
M	DIETER	Because we're not implicated.
M	ROHL	Aren't you? Good. So that's all right then.
F	MARTHE	No, but seriously, Dieter's right. My parents, I can't even talk to them. I don't love them. How could I? How could anyone love them? Because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. Isn't that why we signed up for this seminar?
M	ROHL	I don't know. You tell me.
F	MARTHE	Speaking for myself.
M	ROHL	Michael?
M	MICHAEL	I'm not sure any more.
M	ROHL	What did your father do, Dieter?
M	DIETER	If you want to know, he was in the Waffen SS.
M	DIETER	That's what I mean, that's what I'm saying. So were a million other Germans.
M	ROHL	That's exactly my point. That's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice. Forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state. It has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time.
F	MARTHE	So what is it about? What do you think?
M	ROHL	Societies think they operate by something called morality. But they don't. They operate by something called law. You're not guilty of anything merely by working at Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 for murder. To prove murder you have to prove intent. That's the law. Remember, the question is never `Was it wrong?' but `Was it legal?' And not by our laws, no, by the laws at the time.
M	DIETER	But isn't that...
M	ROHL	What?
M	DIETER	Narrow?
M	ROHL	Yes. The law is narrow.
M	ROHL	On the other hand, I suspect people who kill other people tend to be aware that it's wrong.
F	JUDGE	Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with this book...
F	HANNA	Yes...
F	JUDGE	Parts of it have already been read out in court. It's an American publication, which has been translated. It's by a survivor, a prisoner who survived, Ilana Mather...
F	HANNA	Yes I know. I know Ilana Mather.
F	JUDGE	She was in the camp, wasn't she, when she was a child? She was with her mother.
F	JUDGE	In the book, she describes a selection process. At the end of the month's labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected. They were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to Auschwitz. That's right, isn't it?
F	HANNA	Yes, it's right.
F	JUDGE	And so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process. Now I'm going to ask you. Were you part of it?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	So you helped make the selection?
F	HANNA	Yes.
F	JUDGE	You admit that? Then tell me, how did that selection happen?
F	HANNA	There were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. That's how we did it - every month. We'd all choose ten.
F	JUDGE	Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process?
F	HANNA	We all did.
F	JUDGE	Even though they've denied it? But you admit it. You're saying you took part in the process.
F	JUDGE	Did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths?
F	HANNA	Yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on.
F	JUDGE	I'm not sure you understand...
F	HANNA	We couldn't keep everyone. There wasn't room.
F	JUDGE	No, but what I'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `You you and you have to be sent back to be killed.'
F	HANNA	Well, what would you have done?
F	HANNA	So should I never have signed up at Siemens?
M	CLERK	Ms. Mather, they're ready for you now.
M	PROSECUTOR	In your book you describe the process of selection...
F	ILANA	Yes. You were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to Auschwitz to be killed.
M	PROSECUTOR	Are there people here today who made that selection?
F	ILANA	Yes.
M	PROSECUTOR	I need you to identify them. Can you please point them out?
F	ILANA	Her. And her. And her. And her. And her. And her.
F	ILANA	Each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. Hanna Schmitz chose differently.
F	JUDGE	In what way differently?
F	ILANA	She had favourites. Girls, mostly young. We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. In the evening, she asked them to join her. We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought.
F	ILANA	Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her. They were reading to her. At first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder. Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. But then she dispatched them. Is that kinder?
F	JUDGE	I want to move on now to the march. As I understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months.
F	ROSE	Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. But the plan kept changing every day. Women were dying all around us in the snow. Half of us died on the march. My daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop.
F	JUDGE	Please tell us about the night in the church.
F	ROSE	That night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads. We'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house. But they let us sleep in a church. There was a bombing raid. In the middle of the night. At first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple. Then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to the doors. But the doors had been locked on the outside.
F	JUDGE	The church burned down? Nobody came to open the doors? Is that right?
F	ROSE	Nobody.
F	JUDGE	Even though you were all burning to death?
F	JUDGE	How many people were killed?
F	ROSE	Everyone was killed.
F	JUDGE	How did you survive?
F	ROSE	I needed to get away from the other women. Because they were panicking, they were screaming. I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand their screaming. I was more frightened of the other women than I was of the fire. So I too my daughter and led her to the upper floor. I can't defend what I did. It's impossible to defend. I took Ilana in my arms and I led her towards the fire. There was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level. It saved our lives. The gallery didn't burn.
F	JUDGE	Thank you. I want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify.
M	DIETER	I don't know. I don't know what we're doing any more.
M	ROHL	Don't you?
M	DIETER	You keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there's something disgusting about this.
M	ROHL	How so?
M	DIETER	This didn't happen to the Germans. It happened to the Jews.
M	DIETER	What are we trying to do?
M	MICHAEL	We're trying to understand.
M	DIETER	Six women locked three hundred Jews in a church, and let them burn. What is there to understand? Tell me, I'm asking : what is there to understand?
M	DIETER	I started out believing in this trial, I thought it was great, now I think it's just a diversion.
M	ROHL	Yes? Diversion from what?
M	DIETER	You choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `They were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'. Brilliant! Because one of the victims happened to write a book! That's why they're on trial and nobody else. Do you know how many camps there were in Europe?
M	DIETER	People go on about how much did everyone know? `Who knew?' `What did they know?' That isn't the question. The question is `How could you let it happen?' And - better - `Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?'
M	DIETER	Thousands! That's how many. There were thousands of camps. Everyone knew.
M	DIETER	Look at that woman...
M	MICHAEL	Which woman?
M	DIETER	The woman you're always staring at. I'm sorry but you are.
M	MICHAEL	I don't know which woman you mean.
M	DIETER	You know what I'd do? Put the gun in my hand, I'd shoot her myself.
F	JUDGE	Why did you not unlock the doors?
F	JUDGE	Why did you not unlock the doors?
F	JUDGE	I've asked all of you and I'm getting no answer. Two of the victims are in this court. They deserve an answer.
F	JUDGE	Here, this is the SS report. You all have copies.
F	JUDGE	This is the report which was written, approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event. In the written report, you all claim you didn't even know about the fire until after it happened. But that isn't true, is it?
F	JUDGE	Well? It isn't true.
F	HANNA	I don't know what you're asking.
F	JUDGE	The first thing I'm asking is, why didn't you unlock the doors?
F	HANNA	Obviously. For the obvious reason. We couldn't.
F	JUDGE	Why? Why couldn't you?
F	HANNA	We were guards. Our job was to guard the prisoners. We couldn't just let them escape.
F	JUDGE	I see. And if they escaped, then you'd be blamed, you'd be charged, you might even be executed?
F	HANNA	No.
F	JUDGE	Well then?
F	HANNA	If we opened the doors, then there would have been chaos. How could we have restored order? It happened so fast. It was snowing. The bombs - There were flames all over the village. Then the screaming began. It got worse and worse. And if they'd all come rushing out, we couldn't just let them escape. We couldn't. We were responsible for them.
F	JUDGE	So you did know what was happening? You did know? You made a choice. You let them die rather than risk letting them escape.
F	JUDGE	The other defendants have made an allegation against you. Have you heard this allegation?
F	JUDGE	They say you were in charge.
F	HANNA	It isn't true. I was just one of the guards.
F	JUDGE	Did you write the report?
F	HANNA	No. No. We all discussed what to say. We all wrote it together.
M	BECKHART	She wrote it! She wrote the report. She was in charge.
F	JUDGE	Is that true?
F	HANNA	No. And I didn't write the report. Does it matter who did? I need to see a sample of your handwriting.
F	HANNA	My handwriting?
F	JUDGE	Yes. I need to establish who wrote the report.
M	HANNA'S COUNSEL	I'm sorry, but I really don't see how that's appropriate. Nearly twenty years have gone by.
F	JUDGE	Somebody take her this piece of paper.
M	HANNA'S COUNSEL	Are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago, with handwriting of today?
F	JUDGE	Give her the paper. Counsel, approach the bench.
F	HANNA	There's no need. I wrote the report.
M	ROHL	You've been skipping seminars.
M	ROHL	So?
M	MICHAEL	I have a piece of information. Concerning one of the defendants. Something they're not admitting.
M	ROHL	What information?
M	ROHL	You don't need me to tell you. It's perfectly clear you have a moral obligation to disclose it to the court.
M	MICHAEL	It happens this information is favourable to the defendant. It can help her case. It may even affect the outcome, certainly the sentencing.
M	ROHL	So?
M	MICHAEL	There's a problem. The defendant herself is determined to keep this information secret.
M	ROHL	A moment, please. Please.
M	ROHL	What are her reasons?
M	MICHAEL	Because she's ashamed.
M	ROHL	Ashamed? Ashamed of what?
M	ROHL	Have you spoken to her?
M	MICHAEL	Of course not.
M	ROHL	Why of course not?
M	MICHAEL	I can't. I can't do that. I can't talk to her.
M	ROHL	What we feel isn't important. It's utterly unimportant. The only question is what we do.
M	ROHL	If people like you don't learn from what happened to people like me, then what the hell is the point of anything?
M	GUARD	You have a visitor. Michael Berg.
M	GUARD	Time's up.
F	MARTHE	You've taken your time.
F	MARTHE	Where are you going?
M	MICHAEL	I'm sorry. I need to sleep by myself.
F	JUDGE	The court finds guilty the defendants Rita Beckhart, Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber, Andrea Luhmann jointly aiding and abetting murder in three hundred cases. The court finds the defendant Hanna Schmitz guilty of murder in three hundred cases.
F	JUDGE	The court sentences the accused as follows. Rita Beckhart, Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber, and Andrea Luhmann, you will each serve a total sentence in prison of four years and three months.
F	JUDGE	Hanna Schmitz, in view of your own admissions and your special role, you are in a different category. The court sentences the accused Schmitz to imprisonment for life.
F	JULIA	Where are we going?
M	MICHAEL	I said : I'll tell you when we get there. You told me you liked surprises.
F	JULIA	I like surprises.
M	MICHAEL	She's grown, hasn't she?
F	CARLA	I don't know. It's so long since I saw her, Michael, how can I tell?
M	MICHAEL	My fault. We shouldn't have come unannounced.
F	JULIA	Daddy, why's she angry?
M	MICHAEL	I'm afraid I've have some bad news. Julia knows. We've already told her. Gertrud and I are getting a divorce.
F	JULIA	Daddy's going to live in his own house.
F	CARLA	You didn't come for your father's funeral, but you come for this?
M	MICHAEL	You know, it's not easy for me to visit this town.
F	CARLA	Were you really so unhappy?
M	MICHAEL	That's not what I'm saying. It's not what I meant.
F	CARLA	Well then?
M	MICHAEL	You mustn't worry about Gertrud. I'm going to look after her. And anyway, let's face it, she's already a state prosecutor, she earns far more than I do.
F	CARLA	Michael, I'm not worried about Gertrud. I'm worried about you.
F	JULIA	Hello Mummy.
M	GERTRUD	Hello beautiful.
M	GERTRUD	Do you mind if I don't ask you in?
M	MICHAEL	I don't mind at all. I've a lot to do, in fact.
M	MICHAEL	I took her to see where I grew up.
M	GERTRUD	You went to the West? My God, what a trip.
F	JULIA	We went to say hello to granny.
M	GERTRUD	Oh. Daddy took you to see Carla, did he?
F	JULIA	She was strange.
M	GERTRUD	Come on, let's see what's on TV.
M	GERTRUD	I bet she was strange.
M	MICHAEL	You could say.
M	GERTRUD	She always was. Why on earth did you decide to do that?
M	MICHAEL	I don't know. Impulse.
M	MICHAEL	I suppose if I'm honest we went because I wanted to re-establish contact.
M	GERTRUD	With your mother? And did you succeed?
M	MICHAEL	Are you all right?
M	GERTRUD	Michael you're meant to be an intelligent man. Don't you know, it's very hard to receive contact if you're not willing to give it?
M	GERTRUD	Say goodbye to Julia.
F	JULIA	Goodbye, Daddy.
M	MICHAEL	"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy...
M	MICHAEL	Testing. Testing. 1-2-3.
M	MICHAEL'S VOICE	The Odyssey by Homer.
M	MICHAEL	The Odyssey by Homer. "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy... Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home...
M	MICHAEL	"Ah, how shameless - the way these mortals blame the gods. From us alone, they say, come all their miseries...
M	MICHAEL	"Who are you? Where are you from? Your city? Your parents? I'm wonderstruck - you drank my drugs, you're not bewitched..."
M	MICHAEL'S VOICE	Zeus from the very start, the thunder king Has hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance - His trustiest weapon women's twisted wiles...
M	MICHAEL	The Lady with the Little Dog, by Anton Chekhov. "The talk was that a new face had appeared on the promenade, a lady with a little dog..."
F	HANNA	I want to take out a book.
M	LIBRARIAN	Which book?
F	HANNA	Do you have The Lady with the Little Dog?
M	LIBRARIAN	What's your name?
F	HANNA	Hanna Schmitz.
M	MICHAEL'S VOICE	The Lady with the Little Dog, a story by Anton Chekhov. The talk was... I WOULD LIKE MORE ROMANCE, LESS ADVENTURE
M	MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE)	You're Michael Berg?
M	MICHAEL'S VOICE	Yes.
M	MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE)	You got my letter?
M	MICHAEL	I have it here.
M	MS BRENNER (PHONE)	As I say, Hanna Schmitz is coming up for release very soon.
M	MS BRENNER	Hanna has been in prison for over twenty years. She has no family. She has no friends. You're her only contact. And I'm told you don't visit her.
M	MICHAEL	No. I don't.
M	MS BRENNER	When she gets out, she's going to need a job. She's going to need somewhere to live. You can't imagine how frightening the modern world will seem to her.
M	MICHAEL	Yes. I'm still here.
M	MS BRENNER	I have no-one else to ask. If you don't take responsibility for her, then Hanna has no future at all.
M	MICHAEL	It's kind of you. Thank you for letting me know.
M	MS BRENNER	You're Michael Berg?
M	MICHAEL	Yes.
M	MS BRENNER	Louisa Brenner. We were expecting you earlier.
M	MS BRENNER	I should warn you: for a long time Hanna held herself together. She was very purposeful. In the last few years she's different. She's let herself go.
M	MS BRENNER	They're in the canteen. They're just finishing lunch.
F	HANNA	You've grown up, kid.
M	MICHAEL	I've got a friend who's a tailor, he makes my suits. He'll give you a job. And I've found you somewhere to live. It's a nice place. Quite small but nice. I think you'll like it.
F	HANNA	Thank you.
M	MICHAEL	There are various social programmes, cultural stuff I can sign you up for. And there's a public library very close.
M	MICHAEL	You read a lot?
F	HANNA	I prefer being read to.
F	HANNA	That's over now, isn't it?
F	HANNA	Did you get married?
M	MICHAEL	I did. Yes I did. We have a daughter. I'm not seeing as much of her as I would like. I'd like to see a great deal more of her.
M	MICHAEL	The marriage didn't last. There is a silence.
M	MICHAEL	Have you spent a lot of time thinking about the past?
F	HANNA	You mean, with you?
M	MICHAEL	No. No, I didn't mean with me.
F	HANNA	Before the trial I never thought about the past. I never had to.
M	MICHAEL	And now? What do you feel now?
F	HANNA	It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead.
M	MICHAEL	I wasn't sure what you'd learnt.
F	HANNA	I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to read.
M	MICHAEL	I'll pick you up next week, OK?
F	HANNA	That sounds a good plan.
M	MICHAEL	Good. Quietly, or shall we make a big fuss?
F	HANNA	Quietly.
M	MICHAEL	OK. Quietly.
F	HANNA	Take care, kid.
M	MICHAEL	You too.
M	MICHAEL	See you next week.
M	MICHAEL	She didn't pack. She never intended to leave.
M	MS BRENNER	She left me a message, a sort of will. I'll read out the bit that concerns you.
M	MS BRENNER	"There is money in the old tea tin. Give it to Michael Berg. He should send it, alongside the 7,000 marks in the bank, to the daughter who wrote the book. It's for her. She should decide what to do with it. And tell Michael I said hello. Tell him to get on with his life."
M	MS BRENNER	Do you want to see her?
M	MICHAEL	Ms Mather?
F	ILANA	Yes. You're Michael Berg. I was expecting you.
F	ILANA	So you must tell me: what exactly brings you to the United States?
M	MICHAEL	I was already here. I was at a conference in Boston.
F	ILANA	You're a lawyer?
M	MICHAEL	Yes.
F	ILANA	I was intrigued by your letter but I can't say I wholly understood it. You attended the trial?
M	MICHAEL	Yes. Almost twenty years ago. I was a law student. I remember you, I remember your mother very clearly.
F	ILANA	My mother died in Israel - a good many years ago.
M	MICHAEL	I'm sorry.
F	ILANA	Go on, please.
M	MICHAEL	Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz recently died. She killed herself.
F	ILANA	She was a friend of yours?
M	MICHAEL	A kind of friend. It's as simple as this. Hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life.
F	ILANA	Is that an explanation of her behaviour?
M	MICHAEL	No.
F	ILANA	Or an excuse?
M	MICHAEL	No. No. She taught herself to read when she was in prison. I sent her tapes. She'd always liked being read to.
F	ILANA	Why don't you start by being honest with me? At least start that way. What was the nature of your friendship?
M	MICHAEL	When I was young I had an affair with Hanna.
F	ILANA	I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg. Or rather, even if I could I'm not willing to.
M	MICHAEL	I was almost sixteen when I took up with her. The affair only lasted a summer. But.
F	ILANA	But what?
F	ILANA	I see. And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life?
M	MICHAEL	She'd done much worse to other people. I've never told anyone.
F	ILANA	People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these things.
F	ILANA	What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps. Nothing.
M	MICHAEL	What she wanted...what she wanted was to leave you her money. I have with me.
F	ILANA	To do what?
M	MICHAEL	As you think fit.
M	MICHAEL	Here.
F	ILANA	When I was a little girl, I had a tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite like this. It had Cyrillic lettering. I took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen.
M	MICHAEL	What was in it?
F	ILANA	Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of hair from our dog. Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. It wasn't stolen for its contents. It was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it.
F	ILANA	There's nothing I can do with this money. If I give it to anything associated with the extermination of the Jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something I'm neither willing nor in a position to grant.
M	MICHAEL	I was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy.
F	ILANA	Good.
F	ILANA	Good.
M	MICHAEL	Do you know if there's a Jewish organization?
F	ILANA	I'll be surprised if there isn't. There's a Jewish organisation for everything. Not that illiteracy is a very Jewish problem.
F	ILANA	Why don't you find out? Send them the money.
M	MICHAEL	Shall I do it in Hanna's name?
F	ILANA	As you think fit.
F	ILANA	I'll keep the tin.
F	JULIA	Where are we going?
M	MICHAEL	I thought you liked surprises.
F	JULIA	I do. I do like surprises.
F	JULIA	Hanna Schmitz.
F	JULIA	Who was she?
M	MICHAEL	That's what I wanted to tell you. That's why we're here.
F	JULIA	So tell me.
M	MICHAEL	I was 15, I was coming home from school, I was ill...
