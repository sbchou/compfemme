M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	SARA	Hi. Sara Matthews. She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple
M	R.A.	Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover country. She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.
M	R.A.	You're in room three-sixteen. Welcome. She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling. Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice
F	SARA	Told you we'd make it. She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off
M	GIRL	Sorry! Bad driver. Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --
M	GIRL	In case of emergency. I'm Tracy.
F	SARA	Sara. Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.
F	SARA	Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met this really cool biker? He's taking me to Mexico this weekend. Hello? Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding. Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a
F	SARA	Everything's great. No, she's not here yet so I got to choose my side of the room. She tears a tab off the flyer. Tracy, Tracy's roommate KIM, and two other HALLMATES. All
F	TRACY	Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.
F	SARA	Psi U.?
F	TRACY	They're a frat. Beer... guys...
F	SARA	I don't know... I might just hang and wait for my roommate. Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her
F	SARA	Alright. Just let me change. The girls cheer.
M	BOUNCER	If you want beer, I'll need ID's.
F	TRACY	For a frat party?! Seriously? He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim
F	KIM	I don't drink anyway. Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.
M	BOUNCER	There's punch and non-alcoholic beer over there... He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.
F	TRACY	Come on, just us. We won't tell. The bouncer is tempted but not budging.
M	BOUNCER	Honestly, I'm just a pledge. They'll kick me out. She stomps by him.
F	TRACY	Wuss. Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.
F	TRACY	You want something to drink?
F	SARA	What's the point? Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good, THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in
F	TRACY	Why aren't you dancing?
F	SARA	To this?
F	TRACY	They're not that bad. Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start
F	SARA	Crap. Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.
F	SARA	Where's Tracy?
F	KIM	She was getting more punch. Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing
F	SARA	Uh oh. Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera Tracy. Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the Tracy. Don't. Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who
M	STEPHEN	Damn! Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.
M	STEPHEN	Oh. Woops. I have to go clean this up. She turns.
M	STEPHEN	Looks like my plan backfired. Sara turns back towards him.
F	SARA	What plan?
M	STEPHEN	To spill beer on you so I can start a conversation.
F	SARA	You spilled beer on me purposely? You pissed? She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's
F	SARA	I'll get over it. He laughs, making her smile.
F	SARA	I'm not sure how she's so wasted. All she's had is punch. Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand.
M	STEPHEN	Come on.
F	SARA	It's pretty good. She drinks some more.
F	SARA	It doesn't taste that strong.
M	STEPHEN	Exactly. He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of
M	STEPHEN	Stephen. By the way.
F	SARA	Sara.
F	SARA	Hey, why do you get to drink beer?
M	STEPHEN	Twenty-one.
F	SARA	Old man.
M	STEPHEN	Tell me about it. My back is killing me. They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against
M	STEPHEN	Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands.
F	SARA	Ugh. You're in this frat? He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people Did you try the punch? It's pretty good.
F	SARA	What happened to Tracy? Kim shrugs.
F	KIM	I'm the worst roommate ever. Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which
M	STEPHEN	Do you want to look for your friend? Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods. I got her. She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she
M	FRAT BOY #1	Who's got you? Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor...
M	STEPHEN	Guess that would be me. But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both.
F	SARA	Who's got you? Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around Apparently God. Sara rolls her eyes.
F	KIM	Thanks Sara.
F	SARA	No problem. They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into
F	KIM	You want us to wait? Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the
M	STEPHEN	You know, I'm going to be pulling kitchen duty all week for helping girls leave a frat party. It's like opposite everything we stand for. Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but
M	SAEA	Does that make it worth it?
M	STEPHEN	Honestly, no. She laughs out loud.
F	SARA	Do you want to come up? More than I can tell you, but that wouldn't be fair. Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her.
M	STEPHEN	Keep it... till next time.
F	SARA	Thanks again. For everything. And, sorry about kitchen duty. He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after
F	SARA	Ow! She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her Sara screams.
M	GIRL	Hi. FLASH. The girl takes her picture, further blinding and
F	SARA	Who are you?!
M	GIRL	Rebecca. Your roommate. Sara calms, catching on.
F	SARA	What are you doing?
F	REBECCA	Taking your picture.
F	SARA	Why? Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach.
F	SARA	Oh shit. Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca Rebecca? No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it, Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that Rebecca sees that Sara's awake.
F	REBECCA	Hey Sara. Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened
F	REBECCA	We met last night.
F	SARA	Right... Starts with a... "T"?
F	REBECCA	Close. Rebecca. She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin.
F	REBECCA	Come on. It'll help, trust me. Sara washes down the aspirin.
F	SARA	Thanks. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. I didn't throw up on you, did I? No. You made it to the bathroom. Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various
F	SARA	Did you do those? Rebecca nods.
F	SARA	They're really cool.
F	REBECCA	I just like capturing my moods. A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night
F	SARA	Rebecca -- did you take my picture last night? Yeah. It's just something I do. For my drawings. C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The walk will help your head. Sara rolls over, groaning.
F	SARA	It's too damn early for me.
F	REBECCA	It's three in the afternoon. Sara's eyes bug out.
F	SARA	Holy shit!
M	GIRL	So what do we do? Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit.
F	SARA	Nice bag. Dior? Yeah. Sara snatches the book.
F	SARA	I'm on financial aid. Sara's phone rings. She looks at it: "JASON". Jason. What are you doing?
M	JASON (O.S.)	I just wanted to hear your voice.
F	SARA	I told you not to do this. I need to talk to you.
F	SARA	You're just making it harder. Sara, listen I... I want to come out there. But you didn't come out here, remember. That's the problem. She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her. I've gotta go. Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered.
F	REBECCA	That didn't sound good. Boyfriend?
F	SARA	Ex. Off Rebecca's confused look.
F	SARA	It's complicated. A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up.
F	SARA	We dated since tenth grade and were supposed to go to college together. We both applied to Brown. I got in; he got wait-listed. I stuck to our agreement and we both committed here. Then two weeks ago...a spot opened up at Brown ...and..
F	REBECCA	No?! He took it? What an asshole.
F	SARA	Yep.
F	REBECCA	Do you miss him?
F	SARA	Sometimes I think I do.
F	REBECCA	It's hard to let go. Believe me, I know. But, you're in college now. A girl's gotta move on. Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her
F	SARA	Oh my God.
F	REBECCA	What? Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one
F	SARA	I am so jealous.
F	REBECCA	I know... I've got a lot of clothes. Mind if I put some on your side?
F	SARA	No problem.
F	REBECCA	Borrow anything you want. Really. I haven't worn half of them. Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta.
F	SARA	Jesus, some of these I've only ever seen in Vogue.
F	REBECCA	My parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in Beverly Hills with a Platinum card.
F	SARA	Oh, you here?
F	REBECCA	Pasadena. Off Sara's confused look.
M	REBECCA (CONT'D)	About 20 minutes away.
F	SARA	That's cool. You can go home on weekends. Free laundry. Free meals.
F	REBECCA	Not gonna happen. Sara gives her a puzzled stare.
F	REBECCA	It's a long story.. .Let's just say nothing's free in my house. She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods
F	SARA	Can I take a look? She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest.
F	REBECCA	No. Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came
F	REBECCA	Not till it's done. Nothing personal. It's just my... process. I wouldn't want to show you anything unless it was perfect. Sure.
F	REBECCA	I thought you were a design major. Why are you taking Calc and psychology? The girls get up with their trays.
F	SARA	I am. I want to be well-rounded. And they're requirements.
M	TRACY (O.S.)	Hey Sara. Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks
F	SARA	Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my roommate, Rebecca. She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave.
F	REBECCA	Hi.
F	TRACY	RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can we call you?
F	KIM	How 'bout Reba? Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me.
F	SARA	I like Becca. Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too.
F	TRACY	How 'bout Becky?
F	SARA	Becky's good. The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval.
F	REBECCA	I like Rebecca. Buzzkill. Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	So... here we are. Design 101. And each one of you is asking yourself the same question... Who is this guy? Why should I turn off my Blackberry and pay attention to him? Mild laughter from the class.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I'll tell you why -- because I hold the keys to the kingdom. Think of your favorite designers. Marc Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens. Magicians, right? I've got news for you: All of their magic stems from the same source: the fundamental principles of design. I can teach you those principles. He lets the power of his words sink in.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	The journey to the catwalks of New York... Paris... Tokyo... starts right here, in this room. And all you have to do is open your minds. Man, she wants in.
F	SARA	Professor Roberts? He flashes a disarming smile.
F	SARA	I'm sorry to bother you, it's just... I absolutely must take this class.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I'm afraid we're full. But don't worry -- Intro Design has three other sections.
F	SARA	But you're not teaching them. I want to learn from the best. He smiles at her.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	What's your name?
F	SARA	Sara Matthews. I brought a request form. She holds it out to him. He takes the form, but his eyes stay
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Tell me, Sara -- why should I sign your request form when I've turned down a dozen others? Would that be fair? Sara's face falls. A long beat.
F	SARA	No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks anyway. She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	But... Who said life was fair? You happen to have two things I can't teach... He walks to her... and hands her the signed form.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Style. And Desire. He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches
F	SARA	Hey. Rebecca removes her earbud.
F	SARA	What's your Facebook page? I'll add you as a friend.
F	REBECCA	I don't have a Facebook page.
F	SARA	Myspace?
F	REBECCA	Nope. I don't spend a lot of time
M	ON-LINE	Sara stares at Rebecca. No way.
F	SARA	Come here. Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the
F	REBECCA	Who's she?
F	SARA	Irene. She graduated from the Art Institute out here last year. She's an artist?
F	SARA	A design apprentice for Marc Jacobs. Hey, check out these posts. Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was
F	SARA	I mean.. .who doesn't have a Facebook page?! Rebecca laughs.
F	REBECCA	Okay, okay. I'll get one. Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches
F	TRACY	Cancel those library plans. Guess who made the guest list at Rebar? You guys in? I trust you have fake IDs?
F	SARA	Of course.
F	REBECCA	I don't.
F	TRACY	Yes you do. Thanks to my badass self. Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her
F	REBECCA	I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my scene. Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.
F	TRACY	How great is this? No parents. No curfews.
F	SARA	No shit! They clink their empty glasses in a toast.
F	SARA	Can I? She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse.
F	TRACY	Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk about the life of the party.
F	SARA	Don't be mean.
F	TRACY	I'm just saying.
F	SARA	She's just a little hard to get to know.
F	TRACY	Yeah right... As Tracy rolls her eyes... The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not
F	SARA	What do you think?
F	TRACY	I think... Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink.
F	TRACY	We can do better. She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor. Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling. She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of
F	SARA	Tracy? Tracy. She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against
F	REBECCA	Hello?
M	OPERATOR (O.S.)	Would you accept a collect call from... Sara Matthews?
F	REBECCA	Yes. She smiles. Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,
M	MAN (0.S.)	Can I help you out? She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station Rebecca sizes him up.
F	REBECCA	I'm fine. Just in a hurry. She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,
M	RICK	Just doing my job. She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the
F	REBECCA	All done. She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it
M	RICK	You have a little something. No, she doesn't. He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her
M	RICK (CONT'D)	The hell? His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.
F	REBECCA	Sorry. But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him
M	REBECCA (CONT'D)	Sorry again. Rick. The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every
M	RICK	You spoiled c--- He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him
F	REBECCA	Pussy. She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
F	SARA	Nice car.
F	REBECCA	Thanks. So, where's Tracy?
F	SARA	No idea, I couldn't find her. Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.
F	REBECCA	As long as I'm here... you hungry?
F	SARA	Starved. Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu.
F	REBECCA	I can't believe she ran out on you.
F	SARA	I know. Thanks for coming. Rebecca looks up from the menu.
F	REBECCA	Tracy had her shot tonight. Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show you the big city.. .the right way. And I promise I won't abandon you. Deal? Sara smiles.
F	SARA	Deal.
F	REBECCA	These are the modern pieces. A little wilder than the old stuff. She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't
F	SARA	Okay, I have no idea what this is supposed to be. Even I don't get that one. Come on, I want to show you something. They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of
F	REBECCA	This is my favorite. Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.
F	REBECCA	I love how he captures her personality through her eyes. It's like she really wants to help you. Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
F	SARA	Amazing. I love it.
F	SARA	That is so cool.
F	REBECCA	No graffiti in Des Moines?
F	SARA	Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy loves Rick." Nothing like this. Rebecca pulls out her camera.
F	REBECCA	Hey, smile. Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.
F	SARA	Both of us. They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca
F	REBECCA	Now that's one "art form" I don't get. Needles into skin? No thanks.
F	SARA	I have a tattoo. Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes
F	REBECCA	Really? Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over
F	SARA	My older sister. She died when I was nine.
F	REBECCA	Oh, I'm sorry.
F	SARA	This keeps her with me.
F	REBECCA	I always wanted a sister. Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they
F	SARA	Guess who I'm listing as my favorite artist on my Facebook page? Richard Prince. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check Your favorite movie is "Coyote Ugly"?
F	SARA	Don't laugh. It's about a small town girl making it in the big city.
F	REBECCA	Isn't every movie?! They both laugh. She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out, She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she
F	SARA	Hey there. The kitten purrs.
F	SARA	Look at you. She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs.
F	SARA	No collar, baby? Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching. Wow.
F	REBECCA	I thought you'd like it. Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts
F	REBECCA	Sara...
F	SARA	I know, I know. It's stupid, and I've just broken about forty different dorm rules, and I should just take it to a shelter... What do you want to name it? Sara's face lights up. She smiles gratefully.
F	SARA	Really?
F	REBECCA	It'll be our secret. Just between us. Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.
F	SARA	I named her in the elevator. Cuddles. She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.
F	SARA	Is that my necklace? Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.
F	REBECCA	Sorry. I was just trying it on. Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly
F	SARA	This was my sister's.
F	REBECCA	Oh. Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.
F	SARA	You can borrow anything of mine. Except for this. Okay? It's the only thing I kept of hers. Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.
F	REBECCA	I'm really sorry.
F	SARA	It's okay. You didn't know.
F	REBECCA	Were you two close?
F	SARA	Yeah. You're the first roommate I've had since she died. So, it feels a little odd.
F	REBECCA	In a good way or a bad way? Sara smiles.
F	SARA	A good way. One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now You wanted a mocha smoothie, right? O.K. Do you know what's in that? The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her
M	STEPHEN	This seems like a pattern. Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc.
F	SARA	Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line.
M	STEPHEN	So what does it mean? She coyly shrugs.
M	STEPHEN	Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition tonight. Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.
M	STEPHEN	We're having another keg party.
F	SARA	I.. dunno. I'm still having flashbacks from the last one. Sara laughs.
M	STEPHEN	You know what? How about if I use you as my excuse not to go. Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.
F	TRACY	Hey. Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.
F	SARA	Hey.
F	TRACY	Psi U. tonight?
F	SARA	So you can ditch me again?
F	TRACY	Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And a hot tub.
F	SARA	That's your apology? Tracy jumps up and walks over.
F	TRACY	What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry -- I totally screwed up. Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.
F	SARA	I forgive you. Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,
F	SARA	But you're on your own at Psi U. Because... Someone has a date. Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes
F	SARA	You look... nice. Thanks. Richard Prince is having a showing. I bought two tickets. Since he's your favorite artist...
F	SARA	Actually, I... sort of have a date? Oh. Okay. Major downer. Rebecca goes back to getting dressed. Heavy
F	SARA	You know, I could reschedule.
F	REBECCA	You don't have to.
F	SARA	I want to. On one condition... Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on
F	REBECCA	I love it, who's the designer?
F	SARA	What are you, a label whore?! Who cares ...I got it at a flea market and it looks great with the dress. Rebecca nods in agreement.
F	SARA	It just needs one last touch... She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her
F	SARA	I'm gonna jump in the shower, then we'll head out. She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door. Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and
F	TRACY	Water. I need water. She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She
F	TRACY	Rebecca? What are you doing? Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down
F	SARA	Hey. How was the party? Are you still the beer bong queen? But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.
F	TRACY	Listen... something is up with your roommate.
F	SARA	What do you mean?
F	TRACY	She was outside my room this morning.
F	SARA	Doing what?
F	TRACY	Waiting for me. I opened my door... and there she was. Just sitting there, staring. Like some psycho.
F	SARA	Are you sure?
F	TRACY	You don't believe me?
F	SARA	No, it's just... why would she do that?
F	TRACY	Why don't you ask her? I've gotta go...I'll see ya later. Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Contrary to popular opinion, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. It's in the hands of the designer. Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Who can tell me the difference between fashion and style? FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Miss Matthews? Without missing a beat, Sara replies.
F	SARA	Fashion's something you can buy, but style you either have or you don't.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Exactly. All the money in the world can't buy you style.
F	SARA	But it can buy you a good stylist. The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.
F	SARA	Hey. How'd you know when my class got out? Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.
F	REBECCA	I'm your roommate. Sara smiles and grabs a cup.
F	SARA	Thanks.
F	SARA	Listen... Tracy told me something kinda weird. She says you... scared her this morning. Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.
F	REBECCA	What?
F	SARA	Yeah.
F	REBECCA	It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.
F	SARA	The girl does like to party. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it. Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from
F	SARA	I gotta go meet Irene. Thanks for the coffee. Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.
F	IRENE	Finally. She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.
F	SARA	I so want to be you when I grow up.
F	IRENE	Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up. She's going to be a star. Irene rolls her eyes.
F	IRENE	You know, your dad left me four messages last week. Making sure I'm looking out for his baby.
F	SARA	Oh god. I hope you told him I'm closing down the library every night.
F	IRENE	I told him I haven't seen you. And that for all I know you're a crack ho by now. Even the model laughs.
F	SARA	Perfect.
M	STEPHEN	I haven't seen you around too much since you blew me off for dinner.
F	SARA	Sorry again. Actually, how about dinner tonight?
M	STEPHEN	Hellllo. I'm studying. She takes his book. He's on page two.
F	SARA	Page two? Busted!
M	STEPHEN	Yeah, but it's really dense. Off Sara's smile.
M	STEPHEN (CONT'D)	Okay. Let's go.
F	KIM	How's it goin?
F	TRACY	Hey. Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she The lights go out.
F	TRACY	You have to be kidding me. Hey! The only light is some distorted moonlight through the
F	TRACY	Goddammit ! She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one
F	TRACY	Hey, how about turning on the light? No response. Yet another shower turns on.
F	TRACY	Who's out there? Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along
F	TRACY	I know it's you. She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one
F	TRACY	Sara thinks you're weird. She told me. She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off
F	TRACY	Not funny, Rebecca. Bitch. She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --
F	TRACY	Freak. Just as the warm water starts to relax her... Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against
F	REBECCA	So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me tell you what I think. I think you're a little whore, and a bad influence on her. And I think that if you tell anyone about... what I'm about to do... you'll regret it. Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other The bloody ring in her hand.
F	REBECCA	Nice belly ring. She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.
M	STEPHEN	I'm going to flunk my test tomorrow, thanks to you.
F	SARA	Then let's make sure it was worth it. She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.
M	STEPHEN	Duh, joke's on you. I was going to flunk anyway. She smiles. She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But
M	STEPHEN	Thanks for helping me... not study.
F	SARA	Anytime. He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca.
F	REBECCA	Where were you?
F	SARA	Oh, hi.
F	REBECCA	I kept calling and calling.
F	SARA	Oh. I turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back on. Rebecca... this is Stephen. He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.
F	REBECCA	I'm going to bed now. I'm glad you're okay. She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara
M	STEPHEN	You got a curfew?
F	SARA	Well, she's right...I shoulda called. He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door
F	SARA	I guess I'll see you later.
F	REBECCA	Sara... Last night. I was just worried about you.
F	SARA	You don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself. Okay? Rebecca slowly nods.
F	REBECCA	Sara. We're good, right? A beat. Sara nods and smiles. Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a
F	SARA	I'm already her best friend?
M	STEPHEN	That's a little sad.
F	SARA	Stop. But the look on her face says she agrees.
M	STEPHEN	Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you know what I mean. She looks at him quizzically.
F	SARA	I don't. He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
M	SARA (CONT'D)	You... are...a...moron. He grins. REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle. He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.
F	REBECCA	Stephen. Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He
M	STEPHEN	Shit, wrong aisle. He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...
M	STEPHEN	Should we head back home? They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,
F	SARA	The question is "whose home?"
M	STEPHEN	Hmmm...
F	SARA	I'll make you a bet. I go back to your place or you take me home to my twin bed and roommate.
M	STEPHEN	What's the bet? She eyes the jungle gym.
M	STEPHEN	This is kind of a stupid bet.
F	SARA	Why'd you agree?
M	STEPHEN	Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid guy.
F	SARA	Making me laugh isn't going to help you. They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He
M	SARA (CONT'D)	I was a gymnast until I hit a growth spurt my freshman year. Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this
M	SARA (CONT'D)	So I win. He gives her a playful shove back.
M	STEPHEN	So. She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.
F	SARA	So...let's go back to your place. She gives him a seductive grin.
M	"JASON".	A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens.
M	JASON (O.S.)	Sara?
F	REBECCA	Mmmm? Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can we talk... about us? Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down I miss you. She moves her hand across her stomach. You do?
F	REBECCA	I want you, Jason. I.. . want you, too. But... Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties.
F	REBECCA	I miss touching you. Do you miss touching me?
M	JASON (O.S.)	Like you wouldn't believe.
F	REBECCA	Prove it. His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for
M	STEPHEN	Just give me thirty seconds.
F	SARA	You're kidding. But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him.
M	STEPHEN	Almost there.
M	SARA (O.S.)	I'm going to start taking my clothes off out here.
M	STEPHEN	Yeah, right. He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster. Oops! There goes my shirt... She's got his attention now. He speeds up.
M	STEPHEN	You know I don't believe you. Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to be my strip tease.
M	SARA (O.S.)	There go the jeans. He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed.
M	STEPHEN	I'm just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again.
M	SARA (O.S.)	Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom? Stephen stops and stares at the door.
F	SARA	Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra? Okay, okay. Just calm down. The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her,
M	STEPHEN	I knew you didn't have the guts. She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He
F	REBECCA	Say my name, Jason. Until I tell you to stop. She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow
M	JASON (O.S.)	Sara... Sara... Sara... Rebecca writhes, eyes closed.
M	STEPHEN	Sara... Sara... Sara... They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish.
M	JASON (O.S.)	Jesus, Sara. That was incredible. Rebecca smiles.
M	JASON (O.S.)	I miss you so much. Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her
F	REBECCA	Don't ever call me again. She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log.
F	REBECCA	Well, good morning.
F	SARA	Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot my phone.
F	REBECCA	No problem. Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles.
F	REBECCA	Come on...don't I get any details?? A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell. They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them.
F	SARA	You want to go get some breakfa-- Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down
F	SARA	Oh no. Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed. The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms.
M	R.A.	Is this your cat, Sara?
F	SARA	Maybe... She's cute... She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She
M	R.A.	And if you keep her, I lose my job. Do we understand each other? She stops. Turns. Looks at him.
F	SARA	Yes. Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway.
F	IRENE	What took you so long?
F	SARA	I walked.
F	IRENE	You didn't!
F	SARA	It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a student.
F	IRENE	Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines.
F	SARA	Duh?
F	IRENE	Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked.
F	SARA	What?!
F	IRENE	Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She
F	SARA	Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene. Do you like cats?
F	IRENE	Yeah, why?
F	SARA	We have to get rid of one.
F	IRENE	Can't. Travel too much. Poor thing would starve to death.
F	SARA	You're right. No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't know... whenever I get there. Bye.
F	IRENE	Who was that?
F	SARA	My roommate. More than a little overprotective.
F	IRENE	That's no fun.
F	SARA	So, where is it?
F	IRENE	What?
F	SARA	You said you had a surprise for me?
F	IRENE	Oh yeah. I went through my closet. There's nothing here I've worn in the past six months. Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.
F	SARA	You're kidding, all of these?! Oh no.
F	IRENE	What ...what?
F	SARA	We have no closet space at the dorms. Rebecca's already using half of mine.
F	IRENE	Oh my God, I just had the best idea.
F	SARA	What?
F	IRENE	Why don't you move in here with me?
F	SARA	Seriously?
F	IRENE	Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets.
F	SARA	Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about it.
F	IRENE	Great. So, how's Jason? I really liked him.
F	SARA	We broke up.
F	IRENE	Yeah ...he sucked.
F	REBECCA	Hey. What're those?
F	SARA	Irene gave them to me. She had a lot more but we don't have the room.
F	REBECCA	Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, huh?
F	SARA	Well, maybe that's not a problem.
F	REBECCA	Really?
F	SARA	Yeah. She actually suggested that I move in with her.
F	REBECCA	What? You want to move?
F	SARA	No, of course not. I love living here... with you. Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a
F	SARA	Look, I'd still technically be living here. So you wouldn't have to get a new roommate. Her place is huge and it's not like you couldn't use the extra closet space. I'd just move some of my stuff over, and spend a few nights a week there. We'd both have a lot more space.
F	REBECCA	I don't want more space. I want... She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.
F	SARA	Nothing's set in stone. It's just something to think about. Plus we'd be able to keep Cuddles. As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares Cuddles.
F	SARA	Tracy! Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she
F	SARA	Tracy... hey.
F	TRACY	Oh, hey. Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle.
F	SARA	I heard you changed dorms.
F	TRACY	Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a better vibe.
F	SARA	Well, we should get together. Like grab a bite or something. Right? Sara! Sara turns and waves at Rebecca.
F	SARA	Hi. Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara. I'll call you. But she's already walking away.
F	SARA	Tracy?!
F	REBECCA	What was that about?
F	SARA	I don't know. She just walked away.
F	REBECCA	Well, she's always been a flake. She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez. Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink
F	SARA	Well, actually, I was thinking I'd do Thanksgiving here and see you guys for Christmas. She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what
F	SARA	Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm really getting slammed... There isn't another customer in sight.
F	SARA	I'll call you later, okay? Tell Dad I said hello. Bye. She hangs up the phone and sighs.
F	REBECCA	Looks like it's just you and me tonight. She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside. See how nice and warm it is in there? Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time. The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,
F	SARA	Hey, what's wrong? Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed.
F	REBECCA	Cuddles got out.
F	SARA	Oh no. In the dorm?
F	REBECCA	Outside.
F	SARA	What?!
F	REBECCA	I was doing laundry... I took her with me... She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but... I'm so sorry. Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca...
F	SARA	Maybe she'll come back. She won't.
F	SARA	I'm going to go find her.
F	REBECCA	Do you want me to help? But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her.
F	SARA	Maybe it's... just karma or something. We weren't allowed to keep her anyway.
F	REBECCA	You're not mad at me?
F	SARA	It was an accident. It's just... stress after stress, you know?
F	REBECCA	Is something else wrong? A beat as Sara decides whether to confide.
F	SARA	My parents really want me to come home for Thanksgiving.
F	REBECCA	You don't want to go?
F	SARA	It's not exactly the most festive holiday in the Matthews household. Emily died two days before Thanksgiving. A beat. Rebecca pats Sara's hand.
F	SARA	I know I should be there with them, but it's like there's a ghost at the table.
F	REBECCA	You can come with me. What? Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing.
F	REBECCA	Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my house.
F	SARA	Your folks wouldn't mind? Please. Like they'd even notice.
F	SARA	Okay, we'll see. Thanks.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Your midterm designs are due Friday. Remember, class: Simplicity. Who founded our industry? Eve -- when she handed Adam that fig leaf. Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Sara. Could I see you in my office, please? Sure. I've got a class right now. But I'll come right after it.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I don't think I need to tell you how impressed I've been with your work. Every year I go to Fashion Week in Paris. It's dazzling. The photo shoots... the parties... that incredible runway. When the first model bursts through the curtain and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar goes up from that crowd that's like... nothing you've ever heard. The college allows me to take one student. All expenses paid.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT-D)	Full backstage access. Usually, it's a senior. But it doesn't have to be. Sara's pulse is racing.
F	SARA	I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying what I think you're saying?
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I'm saying you have a shot. You'd have to earn it, Sara.
F	SARA	Of course. I'll do... anything. Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I'd like to see more danger in your work. Your designs are always crisp; they're always clear. But they're a little... safe. That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Don't be afraid to go to some of the... He delicately taps her temple.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D)	darker places in here.
F	SARA	Okay... He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	The best designers push the boundaries of what's... acceptable. They take chances. Do you like to take chances, Sara?
F	SARA	Sometimes.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	So do I. He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her
F	SARA	I can't believe you just did that.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I took a chance, that's all. With a student that I trust.
F	SARA	I better go. Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't blow the chance of a lifetime. She hurries out of the office.
F	REBECCA	What's wrong?
F	SARA	My design professor just kissed me. Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next
F	REBECCA	Are you alright? Sara nods.
F	SARA	Yeah, it just really creeped me out. And I think the asshole's married. Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's. He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black Roberts swallows his surprise.
F	REBECCA	Professor Roberts?
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	That's right.
F	REBECCA	I'm glad I caught you.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Actually, I was just... But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	You're not one of my students.
F	REBECCA	Not yet. That's why I'm here. She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner
F	REBECCA	I'm failing Intro Pysch.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	And why is that?
F	REBECCA	Because I'm bored. I thought it would be all about Freud, and deep dark secrets. But it's brain chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay awake in class.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not sure what I can do to help.
F	REBECCA	Tomorrow's the last day to drop a course without penalty. Unless I can add another one in its place, I'll fall way behind in credits. Daddy won't take that very well. He might even pull the plug. Which means... I'm pretty much at your mercy, Professor. Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Look, I've always made it a policy not to accept any students this late in the term.
F	REBECCA	Do I look like just any student to you? She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty
F	REBECCA	Your wife is very pretty.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Ex-wife . The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk, In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	A few things I'd need to know.
F	REBECCA	Ask me anything. He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Do you have any design experience?
F	REBECCA	None.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	What do you know about clothes?
F	REBECCA	Only one thing.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	And what's that?
F	REBECCA	I definitely look better out of them than in them. What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	I think we might be able to work something out.
F	REBECCA	Great. Just tell me and I'll do anything.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Kiss me. I'll take it from there. He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second, Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.
F	REBECCA	Ow! You're hurting me! Professor, stop!... Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her. This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can
F	REBECCA	Birthday gift. You should get one, they're great. She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few
M	WALKMAN	Great. Just tell me and I'll do anything. Kiss me. I'll take it from there. Owl You're hurting me! Professor, stop!... Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	You bitch tease!
F	REBECCA	Oh, I'm not teasing. She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the
F	REBECCA	Do you see enough danger in me now, Professor? Did I go to a dark enough place for you? He recognizes his own words to Sara.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	What? How did?... Who are you? He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and
F	REBECCA	She trusted you. She walks toward the door.
M	PROFESSOR ROBERTS	Please don't do this. Twenty years. Everything I worked for. I'll pay for that tape. Rebecca stops at the door. She kneels, picks up his wedding
F	REBECCA	Yes you will. She walks out the door.
M	STEPHEN	Anything wrong? Sara is taken out of her own world
F	SARA	What?
M	STEPHEN	Are you ok?
F	SARA	Yeah, sure. She smiles. Stephen smiles back. Sara looks down in her book again.
M	WOMAN	Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll be taking over the class for the rest of the semester. Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the What happened?
F	SARA	Remember what I told you about Professor Roberts?
F	REBECCA	Yeah?
F	SARA	He's gone.
F	REBECCA	What do you mean?
F	SARA	Well, they're calling it a leave of absence. But what I heard... someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another student.
F	REBECCA	Oh My God.
F	SARA	I know.
F	REBECCA	That's called Karma.
M	STEPHEN	I've made a decision. You ready?
F	SARA	Lemme hear it.
M	STEPHEN	I'm gonna quit the band.
F	SARA	No. Really? Why?
M	STEPHEN	It's a waste of time-and we suck.
F	SARA	Why would you say that?
M	STEPHEN	Well, let me think about this. The only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriend's coffee shop. You're right. You guys do suck. A beat.
F	SARA	Hold it. Did you just say girlfriend?
M	STEPHEN	You heard me.
F	SARA	So you think it'll be fun to stay here during Thanksgiving?
M	STEPHEN	Dinner at the frat, the football games. Don't forget the always awkward, homoerotic humor.
F	SARA	Sounds like a blast.
M	STEPHEN	Oh. For sure.
F	SARA	Oh my God. What happened? She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her
F	SARA	Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe now. Talk to me.
F	REBECCA	I was looking for Cuddles. A man... pulled me into an alley. He tried... Sara holds her. She can't finish.
F	SARA	It's okay. It's okay. Shhh.
F	REBECCA	I got away.
F	SARA	You're alright now. Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She
F	SARA	It's not deep, thank God. But you should see a doctor.
F	REBECCA	No. Rebecca, you need to. And then the police. Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.
F	REBECCA	I don't want to. I can't. Sara pulls out her cell phone.
F	SARA	You're calling them, or I am. There's a psycho walking around this campus. Please. I didn't see him. She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts.
F	SARA	Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let me help you. Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently
F	SARA	Sorry about not staying. But, Rebecca...
M	STEPHEN	I get it. I'm going to make out with my pillow and pretend it's you.
F	SARA	Just say you'll miss me.
M	STEPHEN	I'll miss you. Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives
F	SARA	I haven't heard from Jason in weeks. It's weird how he just stopped calling.
F	REBECCA	It's what you wanted, right? Sara nods, reassuring herself.
F	SARA	Yeah. Yeah it is. Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.
F	SARA	This is your home?
F	REBECCA	It's my parents house. It was never a home. Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father We didn't think you would make it. Her mother sees the bruises on her face. What happened?
F	REBECCA	Nothing.
M	DAD	Nothing? This isn't nothing. Leave it alone. Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives
M	DAD	Hello. And you are?
F	SARA	I'm Sara. She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't
F	REBECCA	Sara's my roommate. I'm Jeff. Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara.
M	MOM	It's so great to meet you, Sara. I'm Alison. Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm.
F	REBECCA	Come on, let me show you my room.
F	SARA	You didn't tell them we were coming?
F	REBECCA	They didn't need to know. Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a
F	SARA	These are interesting.
F	REBECCA	Yeah, some of my high school work. I haven't gotten around to takin them down. Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage
F	SARA	Rebecca's a pretty great artist.
M	JEFF	Yeah, we think Rebecca is so talented. Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.
F	SARA	She's an awesome roommate, too.
M	JEFF	That's nice to hear and I'm sure she likes you because she never brings anyone home before. Rebecca stares at her father.
F	REBECCA	Dad!
M	JEFF	What? As a parent you worry. You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own. I'm just relieved she got a good roommate. Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these
F	ALISON	Sara, I'll make up a room for you --
F	REBECCA	She'll stay in my room. Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along.
F	REBECCA	We can share the bed if you want. Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the
F	SARA	Sure. Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.
F	REBECCA	Thanks for coming.
F	SARA	Next Thanksgiving, you can run interference with my family.
F	REBECCA	Done. Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt
M	KITCHEN	Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates
M	JEFF	Becs. You scared me. Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty
M	JEFF	How're you doing?
F	REBECCA	Fine. My grades are good.
M	JEFF	That's not what I meant. She looks down at the table.
F	REBECCA	I'm making friends. Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.
M	JEFF	Rebecca, look at me for a second. Now she looks at him.
M	JEFF	Your mother and I are very fond of you.
F	REBECCA	I know. He doesn't know what else to say. Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.
M	JEFF	I just wanted to make sure. Good night, I'm heading back to bed. He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.
F	ALISON	Hi Sara.
F	SARA	Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some of her high school hangouts.
F	ALISON	Wonderful. Alison peers up the stairs.
F	ALISON	Rebecca seems to be doing well.
F	SARA	Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.
F	ALISON	Is she taking her medication?
F	SARA	Medication? Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.
F	ALISON	Hey sweetheart. She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed. Ready? Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.
F	ALISON	Have a great time, you two.
F	REBECCA	Is everything okay?
F	SARA	Yeah. It's just... She wants to ask her about that medication.
F	SARA	Nice to see where you come from. Come on.
F	SARA	Thanks. The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out. The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep I used to come here like every day after school. The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.
F	SARA	You know them?
F	REBECCA	They went to my high school.
F	SARA	Friends? Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves. Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.
F	REBECCA	Let's leave. Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her
F	REBECCA	Hello, Maria. Hello. The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over, Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.
F	REBECCA	Oh, I wanted to introduce you to Sara. My roommate. Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost
F	MARIA	Hi. Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An
F	SARA	Well, we better go. Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as
F	MARIA	Rebecca. Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.
F	MARIA	We were never friends. Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension
F	SARA	Come on, let's go.
F	SARA	I guess college is a fresh start for both of us. Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara
F	SARA	Irene's back in town. Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.
F	REBECCA	Good run?
F	SARA	Great. You wanna go get dinner?
F	REBECCA	I'm going to the art studio.
F	SARA	Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.
F	REBECCA	Don't wait up, Sara... I feel inspired. She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.
F	REBECCA	Forgot my pad. She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around
M	STEPHEN	Your door was open.
F	SARA	Oh my God.
M	STEPHEN	Sorry. Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her
M	STEPHEN	What are those? A beat. Should she bring him into this?
F	SARA	That's what I intend to find out. Irene. APD -- anti-social personality disorder. Also known as sociopathy. They look at each other.
M	STEPHEN	Jesus. I thought she was just weird.
F	SARA	It says lithium can control the condition. Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along.
M	STEPHEN	Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them. He's right and she knows it. A beat.
F	SARA	I think it's time I moved in with Irene.
F	IRENE	I'm sorry to stare, but you are so beautiful.
F	REBECCA	Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it?
F	IRENE	It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl never knows how late she's gonna party. Rebecca smiles. A beat.
F	REBECCA	Can I try it? Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and
F	REBECCA	You're right... cinnamon. Irene smiles. This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.
F	REBECCA	Why don't we get out of here. I'd invite you to my place, but I have a roommate.
F	IRENE	As luck would have it, I'm only two blocks away and...no roommate.
F	REBECCA	What are we waiting for?
F	IRENE	Shit. She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table. She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen. We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.
F	REBECCA	Hey!
F	SARA	Hey yourself. Where were you all night?
F	REBECCA	Oh, I got inspired. I just lost track of time. Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper, A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the
F	REBECCA	I want a tattoo. Will you come with me?
F	SARA	Uhhh...
F	REBECCA	Please. It would mean a lot to me. I won't be able to do it without you. Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.
F	SARA	Um... sure. Okay.
F	SARA	You can't rush this, Rebecca. We can always come back.
F	REBECCA	I know what I want.
F	SARA	Okay. I'm out here if you need me. Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs. "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )" Sara's relieved.
M	STAIRS	Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara
F	SARA	Let's see it. Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just
M	"EMILY"	Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her. Think of me as your sister. Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara.
F	REBECCA	If you want... you can call me Emily. Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves
F	REBECCA	What's the matter? Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out
M	STEPHEN	This is all you're taking?
F	SARA	I'll get the rest of my things when Irene comes back to town. He takes the box. Then notices --
M	STEPHEN	Where's your necklace? She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.
F	SARA	I can't find it. It's okay.
M	STEPHEN	Sara...
F	SARA	I'm not going back up there. He hands her the box. Time to man up.
M	STEPHEN	Wait here. I'll go look for it. She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.
M	STEPHEN	Have you seen Sara's necklace? Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the
F	REBECCA	What did I do? He stops searching. Looks at her.
M	STEPHEN	She just needs to move on.
F	REBECCA	With you? He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel
M	STEPHEN	If you do find it, can you let me know? Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his She watches him go.
M	STEPHEN	You should call someone. The dean's office. Or at least your R.A. She keeps cleaning.
F	SARA	And tell them what? What has she really done to me? No one can do anything. It's the weirdest thing, Stephen. The girl's own parents are afraid of her.
M	STEPHEN	Well, she sure scared the shit out of me. Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of
F	SARA	Are these dirty or clean? Stephen sniffs the shirts.
M	STEPHEN	Somewhere in between. She throws the t-shirts at him. She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other, But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?
F	SARA	Seriously. Is it a game to be as loud as you possibly can? She waves her arms like a crazy person.
M	SARA (CONT'D)	How many walls can you possibly bump into!? They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut. She hesitates... and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as
F	SARA	Hey, I'm going to hit the library. I can walk you there.
F	SARA	No, it's okay.
M	STEPHEN	Party starts at ten. Really cool band...
F	SARA	I hear the drummer's really hot.
M	STEPHEN	He may be, but I'm sleeping with his girlfriend... She kisses him.
M	JASON	Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210. Call me, okay? He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest, I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want Love,
M	JASON	Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash. She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.
M	GIRL	Help me find the keg?
M	STEPHEN	Sure, I have to go look for my girlfriend anyway. She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch. As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now
F	REBECCA	Shhhh. She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts
M	JASON	Sara? You got my voicemail.
F	REBECCA	Mm-hmmm. Kissing his back now, moving lower.
M	JASON	Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good. She works her way back up to his ear. Turn over. Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees... Close your eyes. He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.
M	JASON	I love you, Sara. She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her
F	REBECCA	But she doesn't love you. Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those
F	REBECCA	You hurt her. She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He
M	LIBRARIAN	We're about to close. Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away. button... But a text comes in from Irene: "Im back. Get your butt over here, I've got another surprise
M	SARA (V.0.)	Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping by Irene's, come on by. I want you guys to meet ...it's on 524 South Grand, Apt. 708. Love you. He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens.
M	FRAT BOY	All hands on deck -- the keg's still alive.
F	SARA	Irene? She walks down the long entryway into a newly-renovated
F	SARA	Irene? There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She Irene. Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts
M	REBECCA (O.S.)	Some role model she turned out to be. Couldn't even take care of herself. Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara
F	SARA	Rebecca! Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.
F	REBECCA	Sit down and shut up. Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene.
F	REBECCA	Listen to me. All I ever wanted was to be your friend. A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.
F	SARA	Rebecca, you are my friend.
F	REBECCA	No. Shut up. We're not friends. We're here because you betrayed me.
F	SARA	Rebecca, I'm sorry--
F	REBECCA	Stop it. Stop saying things you don't mean. I protected you. From that whore Tracy and that nasty little kitten... and That scumbag of a professor... Even that loser ex-boyfriend of yours.
F	SARA	What're you talking about? What'd you do to them? What'd you do to Jason?
F	REBECCA	I got rid of them all. And how do you repay me? By leaving me. Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment. Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in
F	SARA	Rebecca, please forgive me. A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.
F	REBECCA	Now we can start all over again. Let's make things the way they were, Sara. That first day. Just the two of us. Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.
F	SARA	Rebecca...
F	REBECCA	After all... you can only have one best friend. No! Don't! Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to
F	REBECCA	Lay still bitch.
F	SARA	Please. Don't do this... Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die.
F	REBECCA	Stop! I mean it. Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming. Shh... I'm so sorry. Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun. Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But... Don't do this Sara!
F	REBECCA	Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I just want to be your friend.
F	IRENE	My phone. My phone. She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.
F	SARA	Shit!
F	IRENE	The window! There's a fire escape. You can reach it. Picks the gun off the floor. Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.
F	REBECCA	I know you're scared, Sara. But I promise, everything is gonna be okay. She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.
F	REBECCA	Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend, not yours. She raises the gun at the helpless Irene... Ohgodohgodohgod. The more she screams, the more she loses her grip. Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward. Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he Stephen! Help!
F	IRENE	Hurry!! He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.
M	STEPHEN	Okay I've got you. Everything is gonna be okay! He pulls her halfway in the window... But a shadow rises behind him. A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams. She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.
F	SARA	Stephen. Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on
F	REBECCA	You won't do it. We're fr-- Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock. Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall. Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt
F	REBECCA	Friends help each other. They take care of each other. Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.
F	SARA	Rebecca. We were never friends. That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock. Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything. Sara. She races over to him. He's barely alive.
F	SARA	Stephen. Hold on. She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about
