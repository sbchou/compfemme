M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CHARLIE	Lyle?
F	LYLE	I've got the orbital data and SV clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal. That'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100 meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds time accuracy.
M	STEVE	Why can't he talk like a person?
M	CHARLIE	...Because he's not.
F	LYLE	I do need one more thing, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	What's that?
F	LYLE	Someone to turn the goddamn homing device on. No signal, no score.
M	CHARLIE	Where're the Italians?
M	STEVE	Patience.
M	HANDSOME ROB	What's that shit?
M	HALF-EAR	A book. It's called reading. You should try it some time.
M	HANDSOME ROB	You wanna read something. Read between the lines.
M	HALF-EAR	Well here's something even you can relate to. Albert got a lotta trim. That genius thing is a babe magnet.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Lemme see that book. Hello?
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Hi, sweetie.
F	STELLA	Daddy. How are you?
M	JOHN BRIDGER	I'm sending you something.
F	STELLA	Really? Does it smell nice?
M	JOHN BRIDGER	No. But it's sparkly.
F	STELLA	Does it come with a receipt?
M	JOHN BRIDGER	I'm having it sent to you from the store.
F	STELLA	Why not bring it by yourself? We could have dinner.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.
F	STELLA	Let me guess. Checking out the birthplace of Christopher Columbus.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Something like that.
F	STELLA	With your parole officer's approval.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	I think I've paid my P.O. my last visit. I liked the guy, but we never really connected.
F	STELLA	What are you into, Dad? Don't break my heart. You told me you were through.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	After this, I swear to you, I am.
F	STELLA	You promised me. Daddy, don't do this.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Everything's going to be fine. I've got to go now. I love you. Bye.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Italians?
M	CHARLIE	Not yet.
M	STEVE	Don't worry, they'll come through. You can trust these guys.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	I trust everyone. It's the devil inside them that I don't trust. Got a sec?
M	CHARLIE	My office.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	How you feeling, boss?
M	CHARLIE	Fine. I'm fine, fine.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	You know what fine, stands for, don't you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional.
M	CHARLIE	You've become quite the philosopher since you quit drinking.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	You don't like me sober?
M	CHARLIE	No, I'm glad. Makes you a better thief.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	For after the haul.
M	CHARLIE	Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's Italians are a no-show, it's three months prep down the shitter and I've dragged you out of retirement for nothing.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	This is kinda nice. You being the boss with all the worries, me just along for the ride.
M	CHARLIE	Ain't you sweet...
M	STEVE (O.S.)	Charlie!
M	CHARLIE	Your Italians.
M	STEVE	Yup. Dixie cups.
M	CHARLIE	Dixie cups?
M	STEVE	I toss 'em away if there's a problem down the road.
F	LYLE	For those about to rock, we salute you.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Yeah.
M	CHARLIE	Let's get rich.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Can you chill out back there? You'd make a hummingbird nervous.
M	HALF-EAR	I'm done. Over.
M	LYLE (V.O.)	Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.
M	LYLE (V.O.)	Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.
M	CHARLIE	Sweet Jesus.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	"That for which all virtue is sold. And almost every vice -- gold."
M	JOHN BRIDGER	My name is John and I'm a very rich alcoholic. And I'm going to live my life one very rich day at a time.
M	THE CREW	Alright, John!
M	JOHN BRIDGER	You planned this one down to a t, kid. It's a gift. You saw the big picture, made contingencies, covered the angles...
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Shit, you made thirty million dollars in gold drop out of sight without holding a gun. Who else could've pulled that off?
M	CHARLIE	You could've. I had big shoes to fill.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	Fill the shoes but don't follow the footprints.
M	CHARLIE	What're you talking about? You've lived the life.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	My life's been nothing but fake IDs, fake business cards and divorce papers. This is the only thing that's real.
M	CHARLIE	Stella's a beautiful girl.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	She's amazing. And I spent half her childhood in prison. This is a once in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring down the curtain after this one. Make a new life. Find someone amazing and be there for her.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Shit.
M	STEVE	Anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield.
M	CHARLIE	What the hell do you think you're doing?
M	STEVE	Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself.
M	CHARLIE	You're not thinking this through. It's a stupid move.
M	STEVE	Think so? Well you're the brilliant one. The Master Planner. Isn't that so, John?
M	STEVE	You bet on the wrong horse.
M	JOHN BRIDGER	We'll hunt you down. You're gonna regret this.
M	STEVE	No regrets, Dixie cup.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	If you would have told me that I would spend the next three years searching for Steve Bandell, I would have said that was nothing. Cause I would have spent a lifetime looking for that bastard if I had to.
M	FIRST COP	You always work in the dark?
F	STELLA	Buzz of the fluorescents throws me off. She's all yours.
M	SECOND COP	Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.
F	STELLA	Now you know who to call first.
M	FIRST COP	You're expensive, Stella. Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs. Goodwill, community service...
F	STELLA	Well I do it for the money. I'll send you the bill.
M	SECOND COP	Don't you want to see what's inside?
F	STELLA	I never look. Bye, guys.
M	RECEPTIONIST	How long?
F	STELLA	Four minutes, forty-three seconds.
M	RECEPTIONIST	You're the man.
F	STELLA	So what's on the line-up?
M	RECEPTIONIST	2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. Owner died and the wife never knew the combination. And Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning. Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler.
F	STELLA	Tell him if I don't have it opened in six minutes flat, breakfast is on me.
M	RECEPTIONIST	And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. He said you two know each other. And he looks pretty fine for a white boy.
F	STELLA	Charlie Croker.
M	CHARLIE	Hi, Stella.
F	STELLA	Refresh my memory. After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father, I told you I never wanted to see you again, didn't I?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. You did.
F	STELLA	So I'm a little confused.
M	CHARLIE	I found him.
M	CHARLIE	I can tell you where he is.
F	STELLA	I don't want to know.
M	CHARLIE	Are you sure?
M	CHARLIE	He's in Los Angeles.
M	CHARLIE	The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl. I've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak.
F	STELLA	When I was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find.
M	CHARLIE	He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time.
F	STELLA	You ever heard the expression, cut to the chase?
M	CHARLIE	I tracked Steve down to an address in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed his last name to Frezelli. And get this: he had a Worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in. We both know that you don't install a Worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard.
F	STELLA	Precious or not, I don't deal with ill-gotten goods.
M	CHARLIE	We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. Problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. And I need someone I can trust.
F	STELLA	And you think that's me? Haven't you heard that I work for the other side?
M	CHARLIE	What I heard is that you have your father's touch. And he was the only safecracker I knew who could open a Worthington 1000.
F	STELLA	I'm not a safecracker. I'm a professional safe and vault technician.
M	CHARLIE	You're John Bridger's daughter. And this is our chance to set things right.
F	STELLA	Our chance? Who do you think you are coming in here? Stealing the gold isn't going to bring my father back to life.
M	CHARLIE	No, it won't.
F	STELLA	Then get out.
M	HANDSOME ROB	How'd it go with the chick?
M	CHARLIE	I'm working on it.
M	HANDSOME ROB	I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Gotta have her. Important piece of the puzzle.
M	HANDSOME ROB	There has to be someone else. What about Bill Huchins?
M	CHARLIE	Doing ten long at Levinworth.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Red O'Reilly?
M	CHARLIE	Chemo.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Martin Hernandez?
M	CHARLIE	Found Jesus.
M	HANDSOME ROB	I don't want a civilian to screw this up.
M	CHARLIE	She has the skill. And the motivation.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Exactly. She's emotional. You know what happens when emotion gets into it.
M	CHARLIE	It's emotional for all of us at this point. Don't kid yourself.
M	RICHARD	It's all in my patented sideways glance. Like this...
M	RICHARD	I hit each woman on the jury with one of these. We make contact. And I know exactly what they're doing. Undressing me with their eyes.
F	STELLA	I see...
M	RICHARD	The case is all but won. That's why in jury selection I choose as many women as possible. Except lesbians, of course. I can tell in sixty seconds if they're a lesbian. Want to know how I know?
F	STELLA	If they don't undress you with their eyes?
M	RICHARD	Precisely. Like that waitress right there. See? She's looking at me right below my belt. Definitely not a lesbian.
F	STELLA	Your fly.
M	RICHARD	I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait until later tonight.
M	BUSBOY	Oh, man. I'm sorry.
M	RICHARD	You should be. Moron. What the hell's wrong with you?
M	BUSBOY	It was an accident. I'm very sorry.
M	RICHARD	Where's the manager? Richard Worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned. Damn. I'm going to... I don't believe this.
M	CHARLIE	I think your date's going pretty well, what do you think?
F	STELLA	What are you doing here?
M	CHARLIE	What do you mean? I come here all the time.
F	STELLA	I don't think so.
M	CHARLIE	Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of crowd. See that gentleman there, he sentenced me to 90 days in county once. We need to talk.
F	STELLA	No, you need to listen. I want you to leave. Got it?
M	CHARLIE	Hey, I paid valet parking prices to get in here, not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on Mister Zipper.
F	STELLA	You -- I don't believe this. You paid someone to spill that drink?
M	CHARLIE	Actually, you paid for it.
M	CHARLIE	Didn't notice it was me who bumped into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for Los Angeles. I already booked your flight.
F	STELLA	You truly are a fatuous, odious man.
M	CHARLIE	I have no idea what you just said, but I like the sound of it.
F	STELLA	Well maybe you'll understand this. Hit the road, Jack --
M	CHARLIE	Charlie --
F	STELLA	Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause I'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels.
M	CHARLIE	I'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship.
F	STELLA	I'll let you in on a secret. You can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief.
M	CHARLIE	John wasn't just a man I crewed up with, he was my friend, he was the closest thing to a father I ever had. I wish to God I could bring him back. But all I can do is go after this guy, the guy that killed him, and hit him where he lives.
M	RICHARD	Everything alright, Stella?
F	STELLA	Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was just saying goodbye.
M	RICHARD	Can I help you with something?
M	CHARLIE	Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you with my eyes.
M	CHARLIE	Hello.
F	STELLA	I'm in this for one thing, Charlie, and one thing only. I want to see the look on his face when his gold is gone. He took my father from me, I'm taking this; it's the best I can do.
M	CHARLIE	I see Drive Defensively is your motto.
F	STELLA	Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let me down.
M	CHARLIE	By the way you drive, I'm not surprised you named your car after a bottle of whiskey. Left.
F	STELLA	Jack Daniels was chief engineer of the Mini. And I drive it exactly the way it was meant to be driven.
M	CHARLIE	Another left.
F	STELLA	We're going in circles. Who's tailing you this week?
M	CHARLIE	The possibilities are endless.
F	STELLA	Where are they?
M	CHARLIE	We're a little early. I didn't expect us to get here quite that fast. There...
M	CHARLIE	That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really invented Napster...
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	At least that's how Lyle tells it.
M	CHARLIE	Half-Ear. Explosives. He lost fifty percent of his hearing in the fifth grade.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many.
M	KID	That was rad!
M	HALF-EAR	Wha'?
M	CHARLIE	Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He once drove all the way to L.A. just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Smashed the mark by twelve minutes.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	He got a hundred and ten love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on TV.
F	STELLA	And what about you?
M	CHARLIE	I've been a thief since I had baby teeth.
M	BULLY	Cough it up, Charlie!
M	CLASSMATE	So much for lunch.
M	SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE	You need a dollar?
M	CLASSMATE	I thought he took your last one.
M	SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE	He did.
M	SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE	But I got lots more now.
M	CHARLIE	This is Stella. She's working with us on this one. IDs?
F	LYLE	Melvin Lisp? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name?
M	HALF-EAR	220 pounds? Try 180.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Try 'Deal A Meal'.
F	LYLE	I don't even have a cool nickname.
M	CHARLIE	Enough of this sewing-circle shit. Phones.
M	HALF-EAR	Philly Steak says these are clean as a whistle. He also got us four dozen internal chips with different numbers. Change out the chips twice a day.
M	CHARLIE	We travel to L.A. separately.
F	LYLE	You still haven't told us the most important thing. What exactly is the job, Charlie? And who exactly is she?
M	CHARLIE	This is Stella Bridger. And we're finishing the job that we started in Italy.
M	HALF-EAR	Holy shit. It's about time.
M	CHARLIE	We need an in to get a video blueprint of the interior. We're not going into this place blind. Half-Ear, you take the first surveillance shift. Who goes in, who goes out, levels of security, you know the drill.
M	HALF-EAR	You got it.
M	CHARLIE	I also want audio surveillance on his phone.
F	LYLE	I'll hack into the phone company's central office remote observance monitoring system and fool it into thinking there's a legal tap on the line. Reroute the digital copies of his calls to our own listening post.
M	CHARLIE	How long?
F	LYLE	I'll burn through the night, have it up and running before morning.
M	CHARLIE	We need to know how long to get from the house to Union Station downtown.
M	HANDSOME ROB	No problemo.
M	CHARLIE	Stella. How much time will you need with the safe?
F	STELLA	I'll have it open in five minutes flat.
M	HANDSOME ROB	It's not the same as opening a safe for the cops. Your heart will be pounding in your ears. Perspiration on your fingertips. It's a whole different ball game.
F	STELLA	You get me to the safe, I'll open it.
M	HALF-EAR	We've got an anti-scaling fence. Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw won't work. We'll need Nitramon.
M	HALF-EAR	Armed guard. 9MM semi-automatic in the holster. Security booth is accessible and ideal for a triple charger chemical grenade.
M	HALF-EAR	Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. Because dogs are racist. That's a natural fact. Someone else deal with 'em.
F	LYLE	Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System. Monitors 132 points for intrusion, fire, and environmental hazards. Best way around it is to get a back door password, trip the alarm during the heist, then call it in as a false alarm.
F	LYLE	15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 to 20 pounds living off our money. And Handsome Rob, you're going to be pissed when you see his wheels.
M	CHARLIE	Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.
M	YEVHEN	You're right on time.
M	YEVHEN	All those poor bastards out there putting their life savings in banks and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do they think -- that when the collapse comes they can depend on the government? I don't think so.
M	STEVE	Is the camera off?
M	YEVHEN	Of course. Just like you said. I never tape you, you can see for yourself.
M	YEVHEN	Governments are nothing more than puppets on the strings of the Trilateral Commission with their twisted gods.
M	YEVHEN	I mean, it's so obvious that in a world where NAFTA can overturn the Supreme Court, not to mention Microsoft's nefarious financial machinations, this, is our only refuge; gold.
M	YEVHEN	Plus a little walking around money.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Where's a grenade launcher when you need one?
M	HANDSOME ROB	Doesn't matter what time it is. It's either bad traffic, peak traffic, or slit-your-wrists traffic.
M	HALF-EAR	You gotta ride the Metro-Rail, man.
M	HANDSOME ROB	I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a ton of gold, genius.
M	CHARLIE	What's your guesstimate?
M	HANDSOME ROB	If we had all green lights, fourteen minutes. But in the twenty times I've done it, the average is thirty- two minutes, with a top time of fifty minutes.
M	CHARLIE	Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.
M	CHARLIE	When cars first started catching on, workers on tall ladders would use these swiveling colored boards for traffic signals. Now whenever Rockefeller would take the drive from his mansion to his office on Wall Street, the workers would make sure that he got green boards all the way.
M	HANDSOME ROB	How do we get all green lights?
M	CHARLIE	Lyle?
F	LYLE	Let me see what I can do.
M	HALF-EAR	Did you know that the first traffic signal to be patented was invented by a black man named Garrett Morgan? You're not the only one who watches the History Channel.
M	HANDSOME ROB	We still need an in to get the video blueprint.
F	LYLE	Carpet cleaners? Gutter cleaners? Flower delivery?
M	CHARLIE	We'll never get by the guard unless they're certain it's legit. I'm thinking cable TV. We cut his cable, he calls the cable company. We show up. Send a cable technician into the house with a pinhole video camera while we get a feed through an RF antenna.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Who plays cable technician? Steve thinks we're all dead.
F	STELLA	If you're all dead, I guess I'm the man for the job.
M	CHARLIE	Are you up for it?
F	STELLA	In for a penny, in for a pound.
F	LYLE	I'm telling you. He claims he named it Napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his. But I know the real reason. It's because I was NAPPING when he stole the idea from me. I should've been on the cover of Wired magazine.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Would you clam up. You'd give a woodpecker a headache.
F	LYLE	I'm the Napster.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: cable chick.
F	LYLE	Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she calls the other one.
M	HANDSOME ROB	And it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend.
F	LYLE	I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality, it's still going on in my mind. That woman's lived in here rent-free for four years.
F	LYLE	Okay. All we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one. You think Stella will be able to pull it off?
M	HANDSOME ROB	I have my doubts, but there's no talking to Charlie.
F	LYLE	Maybe he's been inserting his hard drive into her software. Clouds the judgment.
M	HANDSOME ROB	He knows better than to mix business with pleasure. Only I'm allowed to do that.
F	LYLE	Where you going?
M	HANDSOME ROB	To get a work shirt and a service truck.
M	SECURITY GUARD	What can I do for you, Mister Frezelli?
M	STEVE	The cable's out. See if you can get someone over here to fix it'.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Yes, sir.
F	LYLE	Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak version of Purple Haze before.
M	CHARLIE	When's the appointment?
F	LYLE	Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Hello.
M	CHARLIE	Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. I understand your service is out and an appointment was set up for Thursday.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Yes.
M	CHARLIE	Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected. Will someone be there for the next hour?
M	SECURITY GUARD	Sure. That'd be great.
M	CHARLIE	Our technician will see you then. Have a nice day.
M	SECURITY GUARD	You too.
M	CHARLIE	Let's check the camera.
F	LYLE	Stella, you're going patriotic today.
M	CHARLIE	He's got cable lines in the kitchen, living room, bedroom and a cable modem on the computer in the office. Try to get a 360 look at each room. And walk slowly or the image will streak.
F	LYLE	I printed these up to look like paperwork from Adelphia. When you're done, ask him to sign and date the bottom.
M	CHARLIE	How you doing?
F	STELLA	Fine. I'm fine.
M	CHARLIE	You know what fine, stands for? Fucked- up, Insecure --
M	STELLA & CHARLIE	Neurotic and Emotional.
M	HALF-EAR	Here's our spot.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Girls girls girls.
M	HALF-EAR	Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Y'got a great job.
M	BURLY MAN	Pays the rent, asshole. You got a problem, talk to Skinny Pete.
M	SKINNY PETE	Philly Steak sent you?
M	HALF-EAR	That's right.
M	SKINNY PETE	So was I right-on about the gold bricks or what?
M	HALF-EAR	That's really not what I'm here to talk about. Philly Steak said you could get us some supplies. What do you need?
M	HALF-EAR	A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon primer. Detonating cord. Two triple charger chemical grenades. Launcher.
M	SKINNY PETE	Nine p.m.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Should we hang here? Check out the dancers?
M	SKINNY PETE	Nothing's going down here. I don't shit in my own yard, do you?
M	HANDSOME ROB	No, but I take a whizz off the deck sometimes.
M	SKINNY PETE	Five thousand dollars. And don't be late.
M	STEVE	It's all right. They won't bother you now.
F	STELLA	It's okay. I'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job.
M	STEVE	I'm Steve.
F	STELLA	Becky.
F	STELLA	You want to show me the problem?
M	STEVE	Yeah. Course. This way.
F	STELLA	I'd like to check the cable modem first.
M	STEVE	I'll show you.
M	OFFICE	She turns her body so the mini-lens can stare at the gleaming black Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes up to his desk and pretends to work on the cable line that feeds into his computer.
M	STEVE	The cable guy who hooked this up weighed about 300 pounds, didn't wear any underwear, and his pants slung a little too low if you know what I mean.
F	STELLA	There we go. Now onto the TVs.
M	STEVE	Is it fixed?
F	STELLA	Turn it on and see.
M	LYLE (V.O.)	Now.
M	STEVE	Perfect.
F	STELLA	Then it looks like you're all set.
M	STEVE	Have we met before?
F	STELLA	I don't think so. Sign here, please.
F	STELLA	Date.
M	STEVE	You read my mind.
F	STELLA	Oh, no. I meant that I need you to put the date by your signature. It's the 26th.
M	STEVE	I know what you meant. This might seem a little sudden, but... would you like to have dinner with me?
F	STELLA	I don't think that'd be a very good idea.
M	STEVE	Why? Is there some kind of cable- rule against dating customers?
F	STELLA	No, it's my rule. I don't accept dates from men I've just met. I've only known you five minutes.
M	STEVE	Then I guess I'll have to sabotage my cable over and over again until you get to know me better.
M	STEVE	Look, I'm just talking about dinner. Friday night. It's no big deal. If you don't like me, you never have to see me again. You know I'm not going to stop until you say yes.
M	CHARLIE	I know it was tough in there.
F	STELLA	He touched my hand. And he came-on to me. That slimy, disgusting man came onto me and I had to pretend that I liked it.
F	STELLA	You do know what this means... I've created our window of opportunity.
M	CHARLIE	I know. When Steve leaves Friday night, we go in. By the time he realizes you've stood him up, we'll be long gone with the gold.
M	HALF-EAR	Skinny Pete.
M	HANDSOME ROB	The guy makes Jabba the Hut look like a spokesman for the Subway Sandwiches' diet.
M	HALF-EAR	What do you think?
M	HANDSOME ROB	I'm trying not to.
M	HALF-EAR	Drive slow. We crash and we're a crater.
M	HOMEBOY	What'd you put in the trunk?
M	HALF-EAR	Suitcase.
M	HOMEBOY	Just gimme the keys before I pop a cap in your head.
M	HOMEBOY	Hurry up!
M	HALF-EAR	Christ.
M	CHARLIE	Looks like that went without a hitch.
M	CHARLIE	Lyle, what's the distance from the front door to the vault?
M	CHARLIE	Lyle?
M	HANDSOME ROB	He only answers to The Napster now.
M	CHARLIE	I'm not calling you The Napster.
F	LYLE	You call him Half-Ear.
M	HALF-EAR	That wasn't my idea.
F	LYLE	And him, Handsome Rob.
M	CHARLIE	That's only cause he is Handsome Rob.
F	LYLE	And I'm The Napster.
M	CHARLIE	How far? The Napster.
F	LYLE	Five hundred yards.
M	CHARLIE	So here's the riddle. How do we get over a ton of gold from the vault to the getaway car?
F	STELLA	How wide is the hallway?
F	LYLE	Only six feet.
F	STELLA	Jack Daniels, straight up.
M	CHARLIE	Minis?
F	STELLA	We could rumble right up the front steps, bring the getaway car right to the vault, and then straight to Union Station.
M	HANDSOME ROB	We'll need three to hold the gold.
M	HANDSOME ROB	I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S. Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 in 4.2.
M	COUNTER BABE	As long as it's a convertible -- I always like to have my top down.
M	COUNTER BABE	Do you know them?
M	HANDSOME ROB	Never seen 'em before in my life.
M	YEVHEN	You're early.
M	STEVE	And I'm in a hurry, okay?
M	YEVHEN	Of course the Florida vote rigging was a CIA and Mob operation.
M	STEVE	That a fact?
M	YEVHEN	You want facts? Fact: CIA officials were allowed free -- and illegal -- access to official election material.
M	YEVHEN	Now given the sordid history in Miami of joint ventures between Central Intelligence and the Mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill Fidel Castro and the successful assassination of your President John F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags.
M	STEVE	And I'd love to hear more about it, but like I said...
M	YEVHEN	Don't worry, we'll have you out in no time. The cash is on its way.
M	STEVE	On its way?
M	YEVHEN	My cousin is bringing it over.
M	STEVE	Your cousin?
M	YEVHEN	Yes. Cousin Mashkov.
M	STEVE	He's on his way?
M	YEVHEN	Don't worry, he will be here any minute.
M	STEVE	The tape's off?
M	YEVHEN	Of course. Believe me, he doesn't want to be on video, either.
M	STEVE	Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, that I never wanted to meet with anyone but you?
M	YEVHEN	I know. But it's his cash. He uses me to launder money. I'm just a middleman.
M	STEVE	And a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle.
M	YEVHEN	But you were early. Please. Don't worry. It will be fine. My cousin's a cool guy. Like I am.
M	STEVE	What you are, is a Dixie cup.
M	YEVHEN	Dixie cup?
M	MASHKOV	My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.
M	DANYA	By who?
M	MASHKOV	That's what I'm going to find out.
M	DANYA	And what will you do when you find this piece of shit who killed your cousin?
M	MASHKOV	I'll hack off his limbs and bury him while he's still alive.
M	DANYA	Okay. But now we should stop talking Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl. How are you tonight, Karen?
M	KAREN	Hungry.
M	DANYA	Then eat your Frosted Flakes.
M	KAREN	They're grrrreat!
M	DANYA	Such a perfect girl.
M	CHARLIE	How are our matchbox cars?
M	HANDSOME ROB	Souped.
F	STELLA	Don't let their size fool you. These were rally cars back in the day. 135 mph, 155 horsepower --
F	LYLE	Do I get to drive one?
M	HANDSOME ROB	No.
F	LYLE	Why not?
M	HANDSOME ROB	Because you can't navigate your way out of a parking lot. Here's your ride.
F	LYLE	But he ran into me.
M	HANDSOME ROB	He's not driving either. You ever got a speeding ticket?
F	STELLA	Let's put it this way: I can only get insurance through companies that advertise on TV at 3:00 in the morning.
M	HANDSOME ROB	You drive. I drive. Charlie drives.
M	CHARLIE	I got us spots for three cars on a car carrier and five first class seats. Train 59 from Union Station to New Orleans.
M	HALF-EAR	That's N'Or'lins, Yankee.
M	CHARLIE	What's the word on Rockefeller?
F	LYLE	The Traffic Control Center is on the top floor of a building on Olympic and Grand. They get their data from pavement loop detectors and video image vehicle detectors. That info is fused together by specially designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control the traffic lights. So all I have to do now is change the data by creating my own algorithm.
M	CHARLIE	What can I do to help?
F	LYLE	I need to hard-wire into the mainframes.
F	LYLE	B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's linear discriminant function coefficients, SpdRat is the speed ratio, and TTratio is the travel time ratio.
M	CHARLIE	I have no idea what you're doing. Just do it fast.
F	LYLE	We own this place.
M	MASHKOV	$2000. And this is the new girl. Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's guys picked her up hitchhiking downtown.
M	DETECTIVE	Those tits'd make Dracula rise from his coffin at high-noon.
M	MASHKOV	They're all yours Saturday. You can do whatever you want to her. Her name is Karen...
M	DETECTIVE	You're too generous.
M	MASHKOV	I needed a fast answer.
M	DETECTIVE	And I'm the Shell Answer Man. A guy who works the counter at your cousin's shop told me that someone named Skinny Pete had been asking around about gold bricks with the face of a Balinese girl on them. Same gold bricks your cousin was buying.
M	MASHKOV	You talked to this Skinny Pete?
M	DETECTIVE	I thought you'd want a shot at him first.
F	STELLA	You want the safe cracked, don't you?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah.
F	STELLA	Then I have to have perfect nails.
M	CHARLIE	Are you making this shit up?
F	STELLA	I just let you in on a valuable trade secret.
F	LYLE	Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah?
F	LYLE	Steve called to confirm a 7:30 reservation at Ago's. And as for your getaway, not even Rockefeller had it so good.
M	CHARLIE	Radio check.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Got cha, boss.
F	STELLA	Loud and clear.
F	LYLE	Check.
F	LYLE	For those about to rock, we salute you.
M	CHARLIE	This is it, guys. Moment of truth.
M	VALET	Are you hear for the Baxter party, sir?
M	CHARLIE	Shit. Stella?
F	STELLA	I know. I've got a date tonight.
M	CHARLIE	You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his jokes. You need him to ask you out again.
F	STELLA	You really make laugh.
M	STEVE	So here's what I have lined up for after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep. The Ferrari always gets me to the front of the line. We'll do a little dancing...
F	STELLA	Not tonight. I don't want to be out late.
M	STEVE	Why the curfew?
F	STELLA	Let's just say I've made some wrong calls in the past. I like to take things slow, cautious. Next time...
M	STEVE	I understand. You have nothing to worry about. You can trust me.
F	STELLA	I trust everyone. It's the devil inside them that I don't trust.
M	STEVE	That's an interesting saying.
F	STELLA	What?
M	STEVE	There's only person I've ever heard say that. Used to say it all the time.
F	STELLA	Who was that?
M	STEVE	A man named John Bridger. Where did you pick up that phrase?
F	STELLA	Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting me.
M	STEVE	John Bridger was a thief. And he had a daughter. About your age. He told me that she took over a safe and lock company that he used as a front.
F	STELLA	Let go of my wrist. What is wrong with you? It's just a saying.
M	STEVE	No wonder I liked you right away. Just like I liked your old man, right up until the moment I shot him in the head. Now tell me who you're working with and tell me the plan. Do it now or we'll go for a ride and I'll break every bone in your body.
M	CHARLIE	Something wrong, Steve? You look like you want to call Ghostbusters.
M	HALF-EAR	She's coming with us. You got a problem with that?
M	STEVE	Fine by me. But it's you that has the problem.
F	LYLE	How do you figure?
M	STEVE	You've just blown the one thing you had going in your favor, the element of surprise. And I was surprised. Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys come out of the woodwork. For a minute I thought maybe you were ghosts. But you're screwed now. Did you figure out how to take care of my security guard? I'll hire five more. You know how to bypass my alarm system? I'll have a new one installed tomorrow. Does it tear you up inside seeing what car I drive? I'll buy a matching one in red. You think you can crack my safe? You'll end up the same way as your dad. Looks like Good Time Charlie's got the blues.
M	CHARLIE	You can wear that shit-eating grin on your face, but I know under that Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat. And you're not going to sleep a minute tonight. Cause you thought you'd gotten away with it free and clear. You thought you'd gotten rid of us. You're the one who's screwed. Right to the wall.
M	STEVE	Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart you every step of the way. And this time, I'll bury you myself.
M	CHARLIE	Get more guards. Change the alarm. Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be here. Sleep tight.
M	MASHKOV	Do you know who I am?
M	SKINNY PETE	You work for Danya.
M	MASHKOV	Yes. And you are gonna be straight with me and everything's gonna be okay. You fuck with me, I will be ruthless.
M	SKINNY PETE	I understand.
M	MASHKOV	I don't want you to understand. I want you to overstand.
M	SKINNY PETE	Overstand... Okay.
M	MASHKOV	Because if you don't overstand, I will use this.
M	MASHKOV	Someone was asking about gold bars with a Balinese girl's face on them. I want the name of this man.
F	LYLE	Well we scared him alright. He's flying the coop. His security guard called Brink's Armored Car Service to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his house, then JetClub to confirm a MD11 cargo plane departing from the Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.
M	CHARLIE	Confirmed? How'd we miss the first calls?
F	LYLE	They must have been cellular. The cargo plane is being chartered to Mexico City.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Only place with worse smog and traffic than L.A.
F	STELLA	Once the charter's in the air, he could change the flight path to anywhere. And good-bye gold.
M	CHARLIE	Not so fast. This is good news for us.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Good news?
M	CHARLIE	Sometimes when you're up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Meaning what the fuck?
M	CHARLIE	We've been trying to get to the gold in the safe. Now the safe is coming to us. We'll boost it in transit.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Charlie. He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one. We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour.
M	CHARLIE	We're already set to do it. Napster: how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of Los Angeles?
F	LYLE	Keep talking.
M	CHARLIE	You gridlock every route except the one we choose. Force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go.
M	HANDSOME ROB	But where do we want it? We can't shoot it out with armed guards in a Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we pulled it off, the cops would be all over us, chasing us all the way to Union Station. We're outmanned and outgunned.
M	CHARLIE	But not outsmarted.
M	CHARLIE	We'll do it like the Italian job. We'll make thirty million in gold drop out of sight.
M	CHARLIE	Who else has this number?
M	HALF-EAR	No one but us.
M	CHARLIE	Hello?
M	PHILLY STEAK	Why'd you do it?
M	CHARLIE	Philly Steak. Do what?
M	PHILLY STEAK	Yevhen. The Ukrainian gold, dealer. You didn't, have to clip him, for Christ's sakes.
M	CHARLIE	Clip him?
M	PHILLY STEAK	Listen to me. You've gotta get out of L.A. Now.
M	CHARLIE	What're you talking about? We didn't clip anybody.
M	PHILLY STEAK	Well Skinny Pete just called me. Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did.
M	CHARLIE	Why does he think that?
M	PHILLY STEAK	Because you wanted, to know about the gold with the Balinese Girl. Plus I guess Pete was under duress. This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul Fucking Bunyan.
M	CHARLIE	Do you know how to get in touch with him?
M	PHILLY STEAK	Yeah but...
M	CHARLIE	Maybe there's a way we can play this to our advantage. Are you out of your mind? Listen to me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. Cause if there's one thing I know, it's that you never mess with Mother Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother- fucking Ukrainians.
M	MASHKOV	He's going to be on Train 59 for New Orleans.
M	UKRAINIAN	You sure your source is good?
M	MASHKOV	I'm sure.
M	HALF-EAR	Did you know Einstein's 7th grade teacher told him he was a moron who'd never amount to anything? Same as mine.
M	CHARLIE	Still hope for that Nobel Prize.
M	HALF-EAR	Not me, man. But I did get my college diploma.
M	CHARLIE	No shit. I thought you dropped out of high school. Got my GED after Italy then just kept going.
M	CHARLIE	How'd you manage that, all the jobs we've been pulling?
M	HALF-EAR	Quit going to strip clubs. Went to night school instead. City college is all.
M	CHARLIE	Good for you. That's a real feather in your cap.
M	HALF-EAR	I didn't want to say anything to the guys.
M	CHARLIE	Secret's safe with me. Napster. How goes it up there? Over.
F	LYLE	Working on the Metro Rail system. Almost ready.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Everything's quiet here. Over.
M	CHARLIE	You okay?
M	HALF-EAR	Ah huh. Just need a moment's meditation.
M	CHARLIE	Now?
M	HALF-EAR	I'm about to insert a wire into a detonator tube and if the wire touches the sides of tube, we'll be blown to Kingdom Come. Best to be at one with yourself.
M	CHARLIE	Take all the time you need.
M	HALF-EAR	My work here is done.
M	HANDSOME ROB	Problemo.
M	CHARLIE	What is it?
M	HANDSOME ROB	He's brought in three identical armored trucks.
M	CHARLIE	Shit. Decoys. It's like a shell game on wheels.
F	LYLE	How can I reroute the truck if I don't know which truck to reroute?
M	HANDSOME ROB	Three Brink's trucks are leaving with motorcycle escorts, plus Steve in his Ferrari.
F	LYLE	How're we going to figure out which truck has the gold?
M	CHARLIE	You can monitor the traffic video cameras from your laptop, right?
F	LYLE	Yeah.
M	CHARLIE	Where's the first camera the trucks will go past?
F	LYLE	Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to cross that.
M	CHARLIE	The weight of the gold will lower the suspension on the truck.
F	LYLE	Lines up with the top of the sign. Next...
F	LYLE	First two are the same.
F	LYLE	That's our truck! License plate AWP82092.
M	CHARLIE	Gridlock time.
M	CHRISTINA GRIEGO	This is Christina Griego with your drive-home traffic report on KNX. I'm looking down on Hollywood Boulevard and this is definitely a CIG alert.
M	STEVE	What the hell?
F	LYLE	Opening up a space on North Highland.
M	GUARD	Get us out of here.
M	DRIVER	I'm trying.
F	LYLE	He's taking it...
F	LYLE	I now command you to turn left.
F	LYLE	I've got it on Hollywood Boulevard. Time to slow down.
M	CHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.)	According to the police, the computers at the Traffic Control Center are down.
M	STEVE	Sonovabitch.
M	CHARLIE	Gentlemen, start your engines.
M	CHARLIE	Give us the flag when you're ready.
F	LYLE	Shutting down the rail as we speak.
F	LYLE	Tunnel's clear. Go!
F	LYLE	Coming into position...
F	LYLE	Five... Four...
F	LYLE	Three...
M	LYLE (V.O.)	Two... One...
M	LYLE (V.O.)	Do it.
M	CHARLIE	Nice work.
M	HALF-EAR	Well like Einstein almost said: genius is ten percent inspiration, ninety percent detonation.
M	CHARLIE	Let's get our gold.
M	CHRISTINA GRIEGO	I've seen earthquakes, mudslides, fires, riots, but this... Let me try to paint a picture for our listeners.
M	CHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.)	There's been some kind of an explosion and a Brink's truck has just dropped down into the Metro Rail Blue Line.
M	STEVE	The truck's in the Metro Rail. Where does the Blue Line go back above ground?
M	MOTORCYCLE GUARD	It comes out at Flower & Pico.
M	CHARLIE	Stella?
F	STELLA	Shhh...
F	STELLA	You know when you said this wouldn't be the same as opening a safe for the cops?
M	HANDSOME ROB	Yeah.
F	STELLA	Did you have to be right?
M	CHARLIE	Don't you want to see what's inside?
F	STELLA	I never look.
M	CHARLIE	Trust me. You wanna look.
M	CHARLIE	Split up!
M	CHARLIE	If you don't like how I'm driving, get off the damn sidewalk.
M	HALF-EAR	What are you doing?
M	HALF-EAR	What -- are -- you -- doing?
M	HALF-EAR	Go that way!
M	FURIOUS DRIVER	What's wrong with you, you stupid- ass, son of a bitch, dickhead...
M	FURIOUS DRIVER	What? You want a piece of me? C'mon, dumbshit. Bring it on. I'll be pulling peanuts out of your asshole --
M	FURIOUS DRIVER	Shit! Shit! You shot me in the foot!
F	LYLE	Where are you going?
M	KAREN	Away.
F	LYLE	How about far, far away?
M	KAREN	The farther the better.
M	CHARLIE	Going up?
M	CHARLIE	I want to make a toast. Cause there's somebody missing here today, and we all know who it is.
M	CHARLIE	To John Bridger. The most brilliant master planner of them all. We wish he was with us.
M	ALL OF THEM	To John.
M	MASHKOV	Take out your gun and drop it on the floor.
M	STEVE	Who are you?
M	MASHKOV	You knew my cousin. Yevhen.
M	STEVE	I never knew anyone named Yevhen.
M	MASHKOV	Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, this one. That gold is for us. A gift from some old friends of yours. They said to tell you that they didn't mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, as long as you didn't get any. Not even the toy surprise.
M	STEVE	Please. Don't shoot me. Please...
M	MASHKOV	Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. I'm not going to shoot you.
M	STEVE	Thank you. Thank God.
M	MASHKOV	He really thought I was going to shoot him.
M	MASHKOV	No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. I'm going to hack off your limbs and bury you while you're still alive.
M	CHARLIE	New IDs.
F	LYLE	Simon Quackenbush? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name?
M	HALF-EAR	250_pounds?
M	CHARLIE	Did you get what you wanted?
M	MASHKOV	I'm happy.
M	CHARLIE	It was good doing business with you.
F	LYLE	Is this seat taken?
M	KAREN	It is now.
M	CHARLIE	We did it.
F	STELLA	We sure did.
M	CHARLIE	There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stella. But I've just been so busy lately, what with the explosion, car chase, Ukrainians and all.
F	STELLA	It has been a hectic day.
M	CHARLIE	It's about that thing you said to me back in Philadelphia.
F	STELLA	That thing?
M	CHARLIE	You said that you can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief.
F	STELLA	Oh... That thing.
M	CHARLIE	Do you still believe that?
F	STELLA	Yeah. I do.
M	CHARLIE	Well I was wondering... What about a retired pickpocket, gold robber, thief?
F	STELLA	Now that's an entirely different question.
