M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	PAT	What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative. You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before." There is a knock at the door.
M	MALE ORDERLY (O.S.)	Come on. Time to go.
M	PAT	I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm
M	GONNA APPRECIATE--"	Another knock at the door. Pat ignores it.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?
M	MALE ORDERLY (O.S.)	Doctor's waiting. Let's go.
M	PAT	I'll be there in a minute. Pat returns to his speech. That's true love. See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water,
M	DANNY	Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...."
M	PAT	Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.
M	DR. TIMBERS	...technically, you can take him out against our recommendation, but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court. And he's just getting used to the routine here.
F	DOLORES	I don't want him to get used to the routine here. Eight months is already long enough.
M	PAT	Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
F	DOLORES	What? I don't understand.
M	PAT	Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
M	DANNY	I guess everybody's leaving today! Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play.
M	PAT	Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
M	DANNY	Bad combination.
M	PAT	Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
M	DANNY	That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother... Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough. I was so jealous of my brother... He's obsessed with his hair.
F	DOLORES	Hello? It looks great now.
M	DANNY	You like it?
M	PAT	It's good now.
F	DOLORES	Yes, it is.
M	DANNY	Wait, you're going the wrong way!
F	DOLORES	What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away.
M	DOLORES (CONT'D)	You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.
M	PAT	All right, Mom, just hold on a sec. Let's just talk about this.
M	PAT	Mom, just listen--
F	DOLORES	Don't tou-...
F	DOLORES	...-ch the steering... ...wheel!
F	DOLORES	Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
M	PAT	I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?
F	DOLORES	I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.
M	DANNY	It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know. He's my friend, so he was rootin' for me. I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault.
M	PAT	Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.
M	RANDY (O.S. PRELAP)	DeSean Jackson. What happened to DeSean Jackson?
M	RANDY	Come on, tell me that one.
M	PAT SR.	It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the one yard line. The one- fucking-yard line. I mean, get into the end zone, dummy. I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!
M	RANDY	You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time. They get close... ...and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex.
M	PAT SR.	Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What makes the Cowboys America's Team?
M	RANDY	Because we are, we're America's Team.
M	PAT SR.	You should be ashamed of yourself. We're in Philadelphia, what's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor.
M	RANDY	What's more American than a cowboy?
M	PAT SR.	You know what's more American?
M	RANDY	What?
M	PAT SR.	Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.
M	RANDY	Benjamin Franklin?
M	PAT SR.	Benjamin Franklin. The founder of our country, here in Philadelphia.
M	RANDY	You mean the guy with the...
M	RANDY	...little glasses and the long scraggly hair? PAT SR. What about the lightning with the kite? He stood in the storm with a kite.
M	RANDY	If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
M	RANDY (CONT'D)	...would even know who he is.
M	PAT SR.	What are you doing? No, no, no, no. Don't touch them, don't touch them.
M	RANDY	I didn't even touch `em. Why are you--, don't blame me.
M	PAT SR.	Who did this? Who took, who took, who took the...
M	PAT SR.	-the remotes like this? Did you do this, Randy?
M	RANDY	No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful!
M	PAT SR.	What?! What's this?!
M	RANDY	Hey.
M	PAT SR.	Everything good?
M	PAT	Mm-hmm.
M	PAT SR.	Ahh.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Where is it?
M	PAT	It's right here.
M	PAT SR.	You got it. Ahh, well, we got that. We don't want them to steal that.
M	PAT	You still got yours?
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, I got mine.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	So what, you don't talk to me? You didn't tell me you took him out.
F	DOLORES	Well, he's ready. Look at him.
M	PAT	You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?
F	DOLORES	Don't worry about that.
M	PAT SR.	I wanna make sure when you come out that you're okay, and she didn't say anything. (to Dolores) You didn't tell me?
F	DOLORES	The court said yes. Don't worry.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because the, the court listens to the doctor.
M	PAT	Yeah, and the court said--
M	PAT SR.	The court listens to the doctor,
M	PAT	Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.
F	DOLORES	Don't worry.
M	PAT	Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, no, I just--
F	DOLORES	It's all under control.
M	PAT SR.	Well...okay, okay. Congratulations.
M	PAT	Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?
M	PAT SR.	You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant. It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.
M	PAT	How you gonna pay for it?
M	PAT SR.	I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it.
M	PAT	From your bookmaking?
M	PAT SR.	Who told you that?
M	PAT	Mom told me. Outside.
F	DOLORES	I did not. No, I didn't.
M	PAT	You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about? Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, "Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking."
M	PAT SR.	Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him? He has the wrong idea. Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
M	PAT	Good, Dad. Good.
M	PAT SR.	Okay, the question, the big question, is what are you gonna do with yourself?
M	PAT	What am I gonna do? I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim, I'm getting really fit for Nikki. I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
M	PAT SR.	Nikki sold the house. She left. Didn't your mother tell you that?
M	PAT	Let me tell you something. You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our marriage...we're very, very much in love, okay? Just like you two.
M	PAT SR.	Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's not around anymore. Nikki left.
M	PAT	What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.
M	PAT SR.	What does that mean?
M	PAT	It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.
M	PAT	What the fuck?! Stupid fucking book! I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids. I mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...
F	DOLORES	It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat. ...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?"
F	DOLORES	Pat, you owe us an apology.
M	PAT	Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.
M	PAT SR.	Why didn't you run with me?
M	PAT	I was reading.
M	PAT SR.	Please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while. What are you wearing a garbage bag for?
M	PAT	I'm gonna go run now.
M	PAT SR.	Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window.
M	PAT	I'll fix it when I get back.
M	PAT SR.	Fix it now.
F	DOLORES	Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.
M	PAT	I don't wanna go to therapy.
F	DOLORES	You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go.
M	PAT	Is that song really playing?
M	RECEPTIONIST	We have music sometimes.
M	PAT	That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?
M	RECEPTIONIST	I can't.
M	PAT	What do you mean, you can't?
M	RECEPTIONIST	I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I-- Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this? Is there a speaker here?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Is, is the speaker here?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay...I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay?
M	PAT	That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's....
F	DR. PATEL	You can call me Cliff, please.
M	PAT	Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in.
F	DR. PATEL	I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.
M	PAT	Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now.
F	DR. PATEL	You have to take medicine.
M	PAT	No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy-- No, you will have to take medication.
M	PAT	I don't want any meds, Doctor. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list. I had one incident.
F	DR. PATEL	One incident can change a lifetime.
M	PAT	But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. She just needs to take responsibility for hers. What's hers?
M	PAT	What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I I left work early -- which I never do, by the way, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the high school
M	PAT	...principal. I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, `cause I should have. I come home, what do I see? I walk in the door and I see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it, and I walk up the stairs, and all...
M	PAT	...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-... ...-VD player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song, and then I look down and I see my wife's...
M	PAT	...panties on the ground and then- ...I look up and I see her naked in the shower...
M	PAT	...and I think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower. What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. We never-... ...fuck in the shower anymore. Maybe today we will." I...
M	PAT	...pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history... ...-teacher with tenure.
M	PAT	And you know what he says to me? "You should probably go." That's what he says to me.
M	PAT	So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.
F	DR. PATEL	All right. Can you talk about something that you did, before or after?
M	PAT	Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...
F	DR. PATEL	...undiagnosed bipolar.
M	PAT	Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.
F	DR. PATEL	That had to be hard.
M	PAT	Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of. Pat, you have to take your
M	PAT	I can't, Mom. I can't.
F	DOLORES	I will call them. They'll come for you.
M	PAT	Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them?
M	PAT SR.	What's up?
M	PAT	I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look.
F	DOLORES	You've gotta take your medication.
M	PAT SR.	Why don't you just take your medication?
M	PAT	Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'. PAT SR. Why is he wearing a garbage bag?
F	DOLORES	Why are you wearing a garbage bag?
M	PAT	To sweat.
M	PAT SR.	Sit down. We're seven minutes in, no score. Come on, help turn the juju around.
M	PAT	I don't believe in juju, Dad.
M	PAT SR.	Come on, Mister Excelsior. You wanna be positive? Be positive. Sit down.
M	PAT	All right, all right.
M	PAT SR.	Come on.
M	PAT	For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.
F	DOLORES	He says you're good...
M	DOLORES (CONT'D)	..luck, honey.
M	PAT	What's that in your hand?
M	PAT SR.	It's a... see?
M	PAT	Handkerchief?
M	PAT SR.	Yeah.
M	PAT	That's OCD. That's crazy.
M	PAT SR.	What OCD? I want my son to watch the game with me, so sue me.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Just sit down, come on. I want you to watch the game with me. I'm not superstitious. That's a small thing that I do. If I make a lot of money, what's the difference if I do this or that? It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.
F	DOLORES	I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.
M	PAT SR.	You see?! You see that?! You're meant to be here!
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	This is special. Everything happens for a reason. That's why you came home. Embrace it! Embrace it!
M	PAT	I'm the reason? I don't think so. Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet. Yeah. No, no...
M	PAT	Mom. ...I'm just confirming. I'm just confirming. Okay.
M	PAT SR.	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
F	RICKY	Can I do..an interview for a school project on mental illness?
M	PAT SR.	No. It's for a school project!
M	PAT SR.	Don't pay any attention.
M	PAT	Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
F	DOLORES	That's him.
M	PAT	Is he the guy who's having the problem?
M	PAT SR.	People are stupid.
F	DOLORES	Yeah, that's the one.
M	PAT SR.	They, they, they, they don't know what they're saying. Don't let them hurt your feelings.
M	PAT	No, you shut the door in his face. I'm going for a run. No! (to kid Rick) Get outta here with that camera!
F	DOLORES	Pat, don't look for Nikki!
M	PAT SR.	Take your camera and get out of here!
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Patrick, please.
F	DOLORES	Pat!
M	PAT SR.	Patty! Patty!
F	DOLORES	Don't look for Nikki!
M	PAT	Ms. Meckers!
F	NANCY	Oh, God! Oh, God! NANCY HURRIES to avoid him.
M	PAT	Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday!
M	PAT (CONT'D)	How are you? Hey.
F	NANCY	What are you doing here?
M	PAT	I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.
F	NANCY	You shouldn't be here.
M	PAT	I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
F	NANCY	I got it.
M	NANCY (CONT'D)	I got it. I got it.
M	PAT	Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here?
F	NANCY	You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here.
M	PAT	Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker?
F	NANCY	You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?
M	PAT	I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.
F	NANCY	Get away from me! Get away!
M	PAT	I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.
M	PAT	I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?
F	NANCY	You just have to give it some time.
M	PAT	Yes.
F	NANCY	You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. It'll be all good. It'll work out.
M	PAT	Yes! It will be!
M	PAT (CONT'D)	I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining!
F	NANCY	Good luck.
M	PAT	Ronnie! Pat. There he is! He's back!
M	PAT	Hey.
M	RONNIE	Welcome home.
M	PAT	Thank you.
M	RONNIE	Welcome back, man.
M	PAT	Yeah, I'm out.
M	RONNIE	Yeah? You're out out?
M	PAT	Uh-huh.
M	RONNIE	Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you.
M	PAT	Thank you.
M	RONNIE	I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
M	PAT	Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.
M	RONNIE	'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?
M	PAT	I know Veronica still hates me.
M	RONNIE	That's not true.
M	PAT	Yes, it is. Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse."
M	RONNIE	That's not true.
F	VERONICA	Ronnie! What are you doing?
M	RONNIE	Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner? Hmm?
F	VERONICA	Did you invite him?
M	RONNIE	Yes.
F	VERONICA	Well, can he make it?
M	RONNIE	I don't know yet! (to Pat) Can you make it next Sunday?
M	PAT	Sure.
M	RONNIE	I'll see you next Sunday.
M	PAT	Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
M	RONNIE	Yeah. Get in here, please. I need you.
M	RONNIE	Okay.
M	PAT SR.	As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El. Andy Reid wastes a time- out challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game. You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do. And we should spend time together anyway. I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.
M	PAT	I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.
M	PAT SR.	What's that? What's the good news?
M	PAT	Things are looking up.
M	PAT SR.	Oh, are they?
M	PAT	You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.
M	PAT SR.	Listen, she might be with that guy. That, the....
M	PAT	Oh, no way!
M	PAT SR.	She--, no, she might be with him. She's afraid of you. She doesn't want to talk to you.
M	PAT	No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?
M	PAT SR.	Put the phone down. You gotta...
M	PAT	Wait just a minute.
M	PAT SR.	...Put the phone down, please.
M	PAT	What are you doing?
M	PAT SR.	Listen--, stop.
M	PAT	Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.
M	PAT SR.	Gimme the phone. Gimme the phone.
F	DOLORES	Pat!
M	PAT SR.	You gotta understand me. You wanna go back? Well then, stop this! Then don't fucking do this. Don't talk to me like that.
M	PAT SR.	Well then, don't behave this way. I got...a call asking to...
M	OFFICER KEOGH	...check on this house. Pat Solatano?
M	PAT	Yeah.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet.
M	PAT SR.	You hear what he just said? You have a restraining order.
M	PAT	Yeah, Dad, I know.
M	PAT SR.	Thank you, Officer.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	If you need anything...my card.
M	PAT SR.	Thank you. Sorry. We understand.
M	PAT	Since when do cops have cards?
F	DR. PATEL	Tell me one thing. Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your medication and if you do fine, we'll reduce them.
M	PAT	Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication.
F	DR. PATEL	Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one.
M	PAT	Let me say something, I gotta say something.
F	DR. PATEL	Okay.
M	PAT	This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
F	DR. PATEL	Work on a strategy, okay?
M	PAT	Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.
F	DR. PATEL	Which jersey?
M	PAT	DeSean Jackson.
F	DR. PATEL	DeSean Jackson is the man.
M	PAT	Well, that settles that.
M	RONNIE	Pat! What are you doin'?
M	PAT	I gotta go, man.
M	RONNIE	Why?
M	PAT	I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.
M	RONNIE	Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey.
M	PAT	I feel like an idiot.
M	RONNIE	Are you comfortable?
M	PAT	Veronica's not gonna like it.
M	RONNIE	Get over here.
M	PAT	Plus you got a tie on.
M	RONNIE	Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come.
M	PAT	Really?
M	RONNIE	Get over here.
M	RONNIE	DeSean Jackson's in the house!
F	VERONICA	You mean rookie of the year?
M	RONNIE	Yeah. DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? jersey to dinner.
M	RONNIE	Isn't it awesome?
F	VERONICA	Not for dinner.
M	RONNIE	Look, he got us flowers.
F	VERONICA	Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.
M	RONNIE	And wine.
M	PAT	Hey.
F	VERONICA	Hey.
M	RONNIE	Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.
M	PAT	Wow! Tremendous. Tremendous.
M	RONNIE	Isn't it great?
M	PAT	Tremendous.
M	RONNIE	Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again.
M	PAT	Why?
M	RONNIE	Because.
M	PAT	Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.
M	RONNIE	Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain.
M	PAT	Isn't the market down, though?
M	RONNIE	It is down, but you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man.
M	PAT	Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.
M	RONNIE	I'm sorry, man.
M	PAT	Yeah.
M	RONNIE	A lot of people. My uncle, too.
M	PAT	Really?
M	RONNIE	Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike. You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money. But the pressure...it's like....
M	PAT	You okay? I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and-- Crushed by what? Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I'm like...suffocating.
M	PAT	Holy shit.
M	RONNIE	You can't be happy all the time.
M	PAT	Who told you you can't be happy?
M	RONNIE	It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.
M	PAT	That's not true at all.
M	RONNIE	You just can't.
M	PAT	Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!
M	RONNIE	I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that?
M	PAT	Who?
M	RONNIE	Veronica's sister. Tiffany.
M	PAT	Tiffany and...Tommy?
M	RONNIE	Yeah. Just Tiffany.
M	PAT	What happened to Tommy?
M	RONNIE	He died.
M	PAT	Tommy died?
M	RONNIE	Cops die.
M	PAT	How'd he die?
M	RONNIE	Please, don't bring it up.
M	PAT	No, how did he die?
F	TIFFANY	How did who die?
M	RONNIE	Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.
M	PAT	You look nice.
F	TIFFANY	Thank you.
M	PAT	I'm not flirting with you.
F	TIFFANY	Oh, I didn't think you were.
M	PAT	I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I do that now. `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	What about your job?
F	TIFFANY	I just got fired, actually.
M	PAT	Oh, really? How?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?
F	TIFFANY	Does it really matter?
F	VERONICA	Baby, how's it going?
M	RONNIE	Great, great.
F	VERONICA	Everyone having fun? We're gonna go on a tour now. We're gonna go on a tour now. Let's go see the house.
M	RONNIE	Come on, let's go for the tour. I've, I've been planning this forever. I love our house. I love our house. I'm really excited about it. Tiffany looks back over her shoulder at Pat, intensely.
M	RONNIE	Come on.
F	VERONICA	Guess what it is.
M	PAT	Oh, it's a television.
F	TIFFANY	It's a computer screen.
M	RONNIE	Nope.
F	VERONICA	Just keep going, keep going, keep going.
M	PAT	It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.
F	TIFFANY	It's a light. It's a...
F	VERONICA	Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.
F	TIFFANY	...it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
F	VERONICA	Don't think so hard, don't think so hard.
M	PAT	Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the-- It's a joke!
F	VERONICA	It's a...fireplace.
F	TIFFANY	In the middle of the wall?
F	VERONICA	We have a port in every room. Gimme an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an iPod?
M	PAT	Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
M	RONNIE	Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.
M	PAT	I would call Nikki.
M	RONNIE	I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one.
F	VERONICA	Gimme your iPod.
M	VERONICA (CONT'D)	Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.
F	TIFFANY	Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
F	VERONICA	Look, look, look.
M	VERONICA (CONT'D)	I can play music for the baby in any room.
M	PAT	Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?
M	RONNIE	Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.
M	PAT	Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from?
F	VERONICA	No. No, I don't.
M	RONNIE	Where?
M	PAT	Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...
F	VERONICA	Oh.
M	PAT	...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
M	RONNIE	Really?
M	PAT	Yeah. Pretty cool, right?
M	RONNIE	That's interesting.
F	VERONICA	You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she's real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
M	PAT	Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.
F	TIFFANY	Why do you have to talk about me like that?
F	VERONICA	I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister?
F	TIFFANY	Don't talk about me in the third person.
F	VERONICA	Please, gimme a break.
F	TIFFANY	I'm right here.
F	VERONICA	Just be nice. Just be nice.
M	PAT	Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.
F	TIFFANY	Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.
F	VERONICA	I know. I know, I know. What meds are you on?
M	PAT	Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped.
M	PAT	You ever take Klonopin?
F	TIFFANY	Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.
M	PAT	Right?
F	TIFFANY	Jesus.
M	PAT	It's like, "What? What day is it?" How about Trazodone?
F	TIFFANY	Trazodone!
M	PAT	Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes.
F	TIFFANY	God, I bet it does.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	I'm tired. I wanna go.
F	VERONICA	No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake.
F	TIFFANY	I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?
M	PAT	You mean me?
F	TIFFANY	Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?
M	PAT	You have poor social skills. You have a problem.
F	TIFFANY	I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.
M	PAT	I tell the truth. But you're mean.
F	TIFFANY	What? I'm not telling the truth? Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.
M	RONNIE	Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?
F	VERONICA	You can drive them both home. Now.
F	TIFFANY	Stop talking about me in third person.
F	VERONICA	You can take Tiffany home first.
F	TIFFANY	You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.
F	VERONICA	No...
M	VERONICA (CONT'D)	...I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
F	TIFFANY	Oh, God.
F	VERONICA	What is your problem?!
F	TIFFANY	Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come on, are you ready? Pat stands.
F	VERONICA	You really, you really wanna go right now?
F	TIFFANY	Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.
M	RONNIE	Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!
F	TIFFANY	Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.
M	RONNIE	Sorry, man.
F	TIFFANY	This is me.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.
M	PAT	How what works?
F	TIFFANY	I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?
M	PAT	How old are you?
F	TIFFANY	Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
M	PAT	Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?
F	TIFFANY	You're married? So am I.
M	PAT	No, that's confusing. He's dead.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Wait, what?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	What's happening?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Oh, my God. Hey.
F	DOLORES	Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?
M	PAT	I don't know, Mom.
M	PAT SR.	What happened over there?
M	PAT	When am I gonna get a phone?
M	PAT SR.	You'll get a phone in due time. (to Dolores) What happened?
F	DOLORES	Pat! LED ZEPPELIN CONTINUES alternately quiet and LOUD. Mom! I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up. What is it? Where's my wedding video? Led Zeppelin continues.
M	PAT SR.	It's after three o'clock! What are you doing?
M	PAT	I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?
F	DOLORES	What about in your father's study? Don't go in my study.
M	PAT	Dad, not now!
M	PAT	Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here. PAT SR. Patty, what are you doing?
M	PAT	He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Is it here? I mean....?
M	PAT SR.	Patty!
F	DOLORES	It's probably in the attic.
M	PAT SR.	Are you going in my study?
M	PAT	It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
F	DOLORES	Please stop yelling!
M	PAT	I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video!
F	DOLORES	Pat! Pat! I looked over there! I already looked all over there!
F	DOLORES	Calm down, Pat. I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears, I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up! I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it! Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I...
F	DOLORES	Pat! Stop it! ...don't care! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No, Mom!
M	PAT SR.	What's going on?
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	What?
M	PAT	I want it! It-... Hey!
M	PAT	It's my wedding! It's my wedding video! Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song in my head, goddamn it! He grabs his head, to stop hearing the wedding song. Mom? What the fuck you doing?! You...
M	PAT	Mom?
M	PAT SR.	...hit your mother?!
M	PAT	No, no, no, no, no! Stop it!
M	PAT	Get off me, Dad!
F	DOLORES	Stop hitting him! Stop hitting him!
M	PAT SR.	I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Police!
M	OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)	Open the door, please. Open up. Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls. People in the neighborhood are scared. I gotta come in. NEIGHBORS clamour behind him.
M	OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)	How are we doing in here, huh?
M	OFFICER KEOGH	There are a lot of reports from your neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.
M	PAT	Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Hey, sit down.
M	PAT SR.	Sit down.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	You gotta stop with these crazy theories. He's a cop. What are you doing?
F	DOLORES	It's a medication problem, but he's fine now.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore? We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office.
F	DOLORES	What?
M	PAT	What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that.
F	DOLORES	Jesus Christ, who's that?
M	PAT SR.	Keep an eye on him.
F	RICKY	Is this a bipolar episode?
M	PAT SR.	Get outta here, you little fuckin' idiot! Get outta here!
F	RICKY	Someone, help me! Help me!
M	PAT	You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Look, I gotta make out a report.
M	PAT	No, no! No!
M	OFFICER KEOGH	She can see it by law.
F	DOLORES	Hey!
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Sit down.
M	PAT	No, no, no, listen, sir.
M	RICKYY	He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help me!
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Sit down!
M	PAT	I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	There's a court order against you -- five hundred feet. Listen to me! ...and I'll take that fucking camera and I'm gonna break it over your fuckin' head, then I'm gonna come back and interview you about what it's like to get that fuckin' camera broken over your head! You wa--, what are you laughing about? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
M	RICKY'S MOTHER ROSALIE	I'm sorry.
M	PAT SR.	Okay.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Go back to sleep. The party's over. Show's over.
M	PAT	...this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	You need to pipe down.
M	PAT SR.	Everything all right?
F	DOLORES	Who was at the door?
M	PAT	Who was that, Dad?
M	PAT SR.	It was that kid with the camera.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Good luck. I gotta write this up.
M	PAT	Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this! PAT SR. It's okay, everything is okay. We're fine, thank you, we appreciate it. Thank you. The family stands together in silence. Hey! What the hell?
F	TIFFANY	What happened to your face?
M	PAT	Weight lifting accident.
F	TIFFANY	That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night?
M	PAT	Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.
F	TIFFANY	This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.
M	PAT	I like to run by myself, okay?
F	TIFFANY	Me too.
M	PAT	Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?
F	TIFFANY	What?
M	PAT	Okay? I'm running here!
F	TIFFANY	Me too!
M	PAT	Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?
F	TIFFANY	I like this road. This is my neighborhood. Oh, come on, please!
F	TIFFANY	Calm down, crazy.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Hey!
M	PAT	What the fuck?! I'm married!
F	TIFFANY	So am I!
M	PAT	What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!
F	TIFFANY	Where is your wife?
M	PAT	You're crazy!
F	TIFFANY	I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.
M	PAT	I'm not the big slut! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
F	TIFFANY	I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?
F	DR. PATEL	You seemed to have trouble last night.
M	PAT	Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....
F	DR. PATEL	He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.
M	PAT	Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
F	DR. PATEL	Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
M	PAT	Yeah, but that's easier said than done.
F	DR. PATEL	You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.
M	PAT	Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?
F	DR. PATEL	No.
M	PAT	Why? Because you have a restraining order. What good are you, man?
F	DR. PATEL	Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?
M	PAT	Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
F	DR. PATEL	Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?
M	PAT	Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
F	DR. PATEL	Why is she a slut?
M	PAT	After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
F	DR. PATEL	Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
M	PAT	She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
F	DR. PATEL	Can you?
M	PAT	Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?
F	DR. PATEL	Yes.
M	PAT	With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
F	DR. PATEL	Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.
M	PAT	No, not the books.
F	DR. PATEL	You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.
M	CHILD (O.C.)	Trick or treat!
F	TIFFANY	Hey!
M	PAT	How do you know when I run?
F	TIFFANY	I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. Did you hear what I said? Why are you giving me such a hard time?
M	PAT	No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
F	TIFFANY	I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit. You wanna have dinner at this diner?
F	TIFFANY	Pick me up at seven thirty.
M	PAT	Happy Halloween.
F	TIFFANY	Hi.
M	WAITRESS	Here you go.
F	TIFFANY	Thank you.
M	PAT	I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
F	TIFFANY	Tea.
M	WAITRESS	Be right back.
M	PAT	You look nice.
F	TIFFANY	Thanks.
M	WAITRESS	Raisin Bran. Milk.
F	TIFFANY	Thank you.
M	PAT	You want to share this?
F	TIFFANY	Why did you order Raisin Bran?
M	PAT	Why did you order tea? Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
M	PAT	I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date. It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
M	PAT	It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
F	TIFFANY	It's good. How's your restraining order?
M	PAT	I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
F	TIFFANY	And the so-called incident with the weights.
M	PAT	Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.
F	TIFFANY	I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.
M	PAT	It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
F	TIFFANY	I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
M	PAT	But you would do it?
F	TIFFANY	I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.
M	PAT	How did you lose your job?
F	TIFFANY	By...having sex with everybody in the office.
M	PAT	Everybody?
F	TIFFANY	I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.
M	PAT	We don't have to talk about it.
F	TIFFANY	Thanks.
M	PAT	How many were there?
F	TIFFANY	Eleven.
M	PAT	Wow.
F	TIFFANY	I know.
M	PAT	I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
F	TIFFANY	Okay.
M	PAT	Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women?
F	TIFFANY	Yes.
M	PAT	Really?
F	TIFFANY	Yes.
M	PAT	What was that like?
F	TIFFANY	Hot.
M	PAT	Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants to
F	TIFFANY	Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.
M	PAT	What? You sat on her lap?
F	TIFFANY	Mm-hmm.
M	PAT	She told you what to do?
F	TIFFANY	Mm-hmm.
M	PAT	Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.
F	TIFFANY	I don't mind it.
M	PAT	You don't, do you.
F	TIFFANY	No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
M	PAT	I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...
F	TIFFANY	I heard about that.
M	PAT	...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
F	TIFFANY	Wow.
M	PAT	Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah.
M	PAT	So I know.
F	TIFFANY	You do.
M	PAT	I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
F	TIFFANY	Me too.
M	PAT	We'd better get back to the letter.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
M	PAT	What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
F	TIFFANY	Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.
M	PAT	Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.
F	TIFFANY	Can I at least finish my tea?
M	PAT	Wait, what?
F	TIFFANY	My tea. Can I finish it?
M	PAT	Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test?
F	TIFFANY	I kinda got that feeling, yeah.
M	PAT	Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.
M	PAT	"Basically"? Was I some percentage not cool?
F	TIFFANY	No, she said you were cool, but you know.
M	PAT	No, I don't know.
F	TIFFANY	Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.
M	PAT	What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?
F	TIFFANY	Sort of like me.
M	PAT	"Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.
F	TIFFANY	Why?
M	PAT	Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.
F	TIFFANY	You think that I'm crazier than you. Because, well, we're different, I
F	TIFFANY	Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
M	PAT	Keep your voice down.
F	TIFFANY	I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Forget it!
M	PAT	Shut the fuck up.
F	TIFFANY	Fuck you!
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	You shut the fuck up!
M	PAT	Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany! DINERS (scattered applause and cheers)
M	WAITRESS	Slow down, Raisin Bran. PEDESTRIANS (low and indistinct chatter - continues under
M	PAT	Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?
F	TIFFANY	Yes, you do.
M	PAT	No, I don't.
F	TIFFANY	You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
M	PAT	What? Hey, calm down! Hey--
F	TIFFANY	Just leave me alone!
M	PAT	Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?
F	TIFFANY	You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole!
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Get off of me! (yelling) Get off! You're harassing me!
M	PAT	Hey, hey! He's harassing me!
M	PAT	Shut up!
F	TIFFANY	Get off! Take it easy. Dude, relax.
M	PAT	Bro, get off of me. He's harassing me!!
M	PAT	Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right? Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Stop it. Hey, hey, hey, get off me!
M	OFFICER KEOGH	What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing to these kids?
M	OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)	Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids? You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do?
M	PAT	I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens.
F	TIFFANY	It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.
F	TIFFANY	You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face. There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
M	PAT	I'm sorry.
F	TIFFANY	I took it too far.
M	PAT	I'm sorry.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Hey, is he messing with you?
F	TIFFANY	No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	There's a restraining order on this guy.
F	TIFFANY	I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	That's not a good thing to do.
F	TIFFANY	Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	You're Tommy's widow, right?
F	TIFFANY	Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? What'd I say?
M	PAT	She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.
M	PAT	I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.
F	TIFFANY	I know. I know you didn't mean it.
M	PAT	I didn't mean it at all.
F	TIFFANY	I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.
M	PAT	All the time.
F	TIFFANY	I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her
M	PAT	Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany. I know you do.
M	PAT	You do? Yeah, sure.
M	PAT	I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?
M	RANDY	I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer.
M	PAT SR.	No, no, no.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Dolores, somebody was in my study. Who took one of my envelopes? Somebody took an envelope.
F	DOLORES	Maybe we should call the FBI.
M	PAT SR.	Don't make fun. This is serious. What FBI? Come on, let's take a look. I'll show you what this is. I'm gonna just explain to you something. I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey. This everything, like this. I got this, it all corresponds.
M	PAT	Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta ask.
F	DOLORES	"Do not go in my study or I will eat you!"
M	PAT SR.	It's not funny, it's not funny. What's everybody making a joke out of this for?
M	RANDY	Dolores, you are so beautiful! Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop! Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in `em. So show some respect for what I do.
M	PAT	Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number.
M	PAT SR.	Thank you.
M	PAT	But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.
M	PAT SR.	You didn't want to wake me? (to Dolores and Randy) He didn't want to wake me. He doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway. He doesn't have a problem asking for his wedding
F	DOLORES	Be nice. It's game day! I'm makin' crabby snacks and homemades.
M	PAT	Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad!
M	PAT SR.	What are you so up about?
F	DOLORES	He's very happy.
M	PAT	I'm happy.
M	PAT SR.	No, you're so up, up, up, up.
M	PAT	Isn't that a good thing?
M	PAT SR.	You're just up, up, up. I don't know what that is. Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?
M	PAT	Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am.
M	PAT SR.	Okay. Taking a little bit too many or something?
M	PAT	No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad.
M	PAT SR.	Just stay with us. Stay for the game. Spend some family time.
M	PAT	Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.
M	PAT SR.	Spend family time.
M	PAT	Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?
M	RANDY	Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out.
M	PAT SR.	Come on.
M	PAT	I can't.
M	PAT SR.	It's the Seahawks. Put on the jersey and stay, please. Please. It's important, please.
F	DOLORES	What are you up to, Pat?
M	PAT	Nothing, come on. What's in the envelope?
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, what are you doing? What's in that envelope?
M	PAT	Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard! I'm playing down field! I feel great!
M	PAT	Tiffany!
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?
M	TIFFANY'S MOTHER	What do you want with her?
M	TIFFANY'S FATHER	Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.
M	PAT	Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.
M	TIFFANY'S FATHER	Oh, great, a married creep.
M	PAT	I'm her friend.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner.
M	TIFFANY'S MOTHER	She's not here.
M	JORDIE	Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home?
M	TIFFANY'S MOTHER	Go away.
M	JORDIE	I know her. I know her, we've dated. We still date.
M	PAT	What are you doing here?
M	JORDIE	I've called her, I've texted her.
M	PAT	Do you know this guy?
M	JORDIE	I still haven't heard back. We used to work together--
M	TIFFANY'S FATHER	Just get the hell out of here...
M	JORDIE	I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.
M	TIFFANY'S FATHER	Another rude creep.
M	PAT	Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he's saying.
M	JORDIE	What's he saying?
M	PAT	He's saying you're being rude.
M	JORDIE	How am I being rude?
M	PAT	Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and
M	PAT	--it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed. And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes.
M	JORDIE	She just texted me!
M	PAT	Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?
F	TIFFANY	I can't, I can't do it. What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?
F	TIFFANY	I can't give the letter to Nikki.
M	PAT	Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?
F	TIFFANY	Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?
M	PAT	You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.
F	TIFFANY	I know.
M	PAT	That was the set-up.
F	TIFFANY	Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!
M	PAT	What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own?
F	TIFFANY	I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. Pat takes this in.
M	PAT	Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?
F	TIFFANY	I can't do it.
M	PAT	Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Think of something.
F	TIFFANY	There's this thing.
M	PAT	There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?
F	TIFFANY	It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.
M	PAT	It's a dance thing, all right.
F	TIFFANY	It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.
M	PAT	Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.
F	TIFFANY	Would you please!
M	PAT	I don't have a filter when I talk.
F	TIFFANY	Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.
M	PAT	Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
F	TIFFANY	But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.
M	PAT	Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about?
F	TIFFANY	What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad?
M	PAT	Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.
F	TIFFANY	All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.
M	PAT	Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.
F	TIFFANY	Think about it.
M	PAT	Well, I already did do something for you, you know.
M	PAT	I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.
F	TIFFANY	What? Jordie?
M	PAT	Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.
F	TIFFANY	Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?
M	PAT	It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different.
F	TIFFANY	How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.
M	PAT	We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.
F	TIFFANY	Wow.
M	PAT	It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.
F	TIFFANY	It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing. Danny, you're out of the hospital? And you're here on game day?
M	DANNY	I'm out.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go.
M	PAT	I never understand what he's saying.
M	PAT SR.	Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on, let's come back and sit down the way you were before. What a treat!
M	AND RONNIE STAND.	SPORTS ANNOUNCER (over television) (low and indistinct
M	PAT	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here?
M	PAT SR.	Oh, yeah.
M	DANNY	He calls me "Jailhouse Lawyer."
M	PAT SR.	Hold the remote the way you were holding it before.
M	DANNY	Okay.
M	PAT	And now you're holding the remote?
M	DANNY	And it's working. Your dad's a genius. PAT SR. URGES DANNY TO SIT UP STRAIGHTER with remote.
M	PAT SR.	Now sit up.
M	PAT	And Danny's the good luck charm?
M	PAT SR.	Danny's from you. This is your house, so it comes down to you. You're the one.
M	DANNY	Yeah, you're the one, Pat.
M	PAT	Superstition, Danny. I don't know.
M	PAT SR.	Come sit down. Don't disappear doing God knows what with that Tiffany Maxwell.
M	PAT	Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that?
M	RONNIE	Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She goes to a lot of therapy.
M	PAT	I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say?
M	RONNIE	I'm just saying-- Am I messed up? Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed up marriage.
M	RONNIE	I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable. What's wrong with your marriage? What's wrong with your marriage?
M	RONNIE	Nothing's wrong!
M	PAT	You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there.
M	RONNIE	Shh, shh.
M	PAT	What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it.
M	RONNIE	Stop breaking my balls.
M	PAT	Oh!!!!
M	RONNIE	I got you an iPod.
M	PAT	Whoa! Is this for me?
M	RONNIE	Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but- Oh, buddy, thank you. That's so nice of you. Wow.
M	RONNIE	Thirty-two gigabytes.
M	PAT	How many songs is that?
M	RONNIE	Seven thousand.
M	PAT	Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers. You love The Stranglers. Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
M	RONNIE	Got some Clash.
M	PAT	Oh, "West Side Story."
M	RONNIE	Yeah, "West Side Story." It makes me peaceful. "Maria, I just met a girl named Maria..."
M	PAT	Right, right, right.
M	RONNIE	And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage...Metallica...Megadeth. I start fucking smashing shit.
M	PAT	You gotta get your marriage together. I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And --
M	PAT	Ronnie, that's fucked up.
M	RONNIE	Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know?
M	PAT	When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...
M	JAKE (O.S.)	Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki? Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer wall, to Jake on
M	JAKE (CONT'D)	A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. [Walks down to Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?
M	PAT	How you doing, Jake?
F	JAKE	Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.
F	DOLORES	Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?
F	JAKE	So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm. Pat just stares at Jake. The room is silent.
M	JAKE (CONT'D)	Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm. PAT SR. Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him. Just, you know, leave it alone. We're watching the game.
F	JAKE	You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth. Pat stares down Jake. Tense.
M	PAT	As my friend Danny would say 00 The room hangs on Pat's words.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	I got nothing but love for you, brother.
M	DANNY	That's right. That's right.
M	RONNIE/RANDY/DANNY/DELORES (O.C.)	That's nice. That's nice.
M	PAT SR.	Well, thank God, finally.
M	PAT	DeSean Jackson.
F	JAKE	Yeah. Did it fit?
M	PAT	I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.
M	RONNIE	Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.
M	PAT	Veronica didn't like it.
M	RONNIE	Veronica hates the jersey.
F	JAKE	Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?
M	PAT	I'm not doing anything!
M	RONNIE	Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
F	DOLORES	Pat, you're up to something, I know.
M	PAT	People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we're
M	DANNY	We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it. Everybody's just not in touch with it.
F	DOLORES	Oh, no.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	How you doing, Pat?
M	PAT	Jesus.
M	PAT SR.	I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming. I'm taking him back to the hospital.
M	PAT	What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?
M	DANNY	First of all, check with the latest legal development.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so.... Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?
M	OFFICER KEOGH	I'm an Eagles fan.
M	PAT SR.	Well then, what's the problem? He's not goin' anywhere. Just let him finish the game, that's all. The handkerchief is working. We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven- ten. What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please!
M	OFFICER KEOGH	I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore.
M	DANNY	Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.
M	OFFICER KEOGH	Come on.
M	DANNY	You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
F	TIFFANY	I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.
M	PAT	Wow.
F	TIFFANY	I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
M	PAT	Where do you sleep?
F	TIFFANY	Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.
M	PAT	
F	TIFFANY	What?
M	PAT	The letter to Nikki.
F	TIFFANY	Probably tonight.
M	PAT	Really?
F	TIFFANY	Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.
M	PAT	Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very
F	TIFFANY	Mm-hmm.
M	PAT	-and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the No, that's good, that's really good.
M	PAT	I assume you're a good teacher.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah. I mean, I hope so.
M	PAT	Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.
M	PAT	You know, being of service.
F	TIFFANY	Yeah.
M	PAT	To your need.
F	TIFFANY	Uh-huh. All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room. Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.
M	PAT	Can we do something else besides the dance deal?
F	TIFFANY	Are you fucking kidding me?
M	PAT	I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?
F	TIFFANY	A deal is a deal.
M	PAT	I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
F	TIFFANY	Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.
M	PAT	I'm not doing it.
F	TIFFANY	Only walk. Do it.
M	PAT	No. That's stupid.
F	TIFFANY	No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.
M	PAT	You're not Nikki.
F	TIFFANY	Don't look up until you're halfway here.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	That's right.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Not yet.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.
M	PAT	I don't feel anything.
F	TIFFANY	Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
M	PAT	No.
F	TIFFANY	We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) That's a feeling.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.
F	DOLORES	Whoa! Slow down.
M	PAT	What?
F	DOLORES	Your father wanted you to have this.
M	PAT	He wants me to have-
M	PAT (CONT'D)	-all this Eagles information.
F	DOLORES	It's his living.
M	PAT	Um, tell Dad thanks.
F	DOLORES	Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat. Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies."
M	PAT	Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.
F	TIFFANY	I don't give a fuck.
M	PAT	What the hell are you doing?
M	PAT (O.S.)	Hey, hey!
M	PAT	Did you just throw that outside?
F	TIFFANY	What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
M	PAT	Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Who's that? What the....? (laughing) What are you doing here, man?
M	DANNY	If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out.
M	PAT	How'd you know we were here?
M	DANNY	I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here.
M	PAT	Danny, this is Tiffany. (to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.
F	TIFFANY	Hello. Pat told me about you.
M	DANNY	So is the girl, that you wrote about?
M	PAT	Yeah.
F	TIFFANY	What? He wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?
M	DANNY	He wrote about you, all right.
F	TIFFANY	What'd he say?
M	DANNY	He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but--
M	PAT	Whoa, whoa, that's enough.
F	TIFFANY	No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.
M	PAT	Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter.
F	TIFFANY	Cool.
M	DANNY	She's fine.
M	PAT	She is my friend with an "F."
M	DANNY	A capital "F."
M	PAT	For "friend." The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.
M	DANNY	Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?
M	PAT	Yeah.
F	TIFFANY	Okay.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	And then this goes into something else.
M	DANNY	That's it?
M	PAT	Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.
M	DANNY	Can I say something? Do you mind?
F	TIFFANY	No.
M	DANNY	You sure?
M	PAT	Just say it. Say it.
F	TIFFANY	No, please.
M	DANNY	I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man. You should move more hips. Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And....
M	PAT	Okay.
M	DANNY	Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a bit more. You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. You're pretty good. Mm, yeah.
M	PAT	Okay, we got it, we got it.
M	DANNY	Okay. Okay.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.
M	PAT	"Black it up"?
M	DANNY	You know damn well what it means.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an idea.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	Come get some, Pat. Come get some.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta move your junk.
M	DANNY (CONT'D)	I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya. She lives on this side of town.
M	PAT	Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.
M	DANNY	Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!
F	TIFFANY	Bye!
M	DANNY	Excelsior, Pat!
M	PAT	Excelsior!
M	DANNY	That's my man.
M	PAT SR.	Hey. Patty.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Pat.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Patty. Where have you been? Huh?
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that. Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you realize that?
M	PAT	I didn't realize that.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in.
M	PAT	Okay.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah?
M	PAT	Right.
M	PAT SR.	Hmm?
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend enough time with you growing up. I spent too much time with your brother. It might have made you feel worse about your behavior, but I didn't know anything, I didn't know how to handle it. I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about. It's about us, spending time now. I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet. That's the whole point. Yeah. I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things. (inhales) So would you, would you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now?
M	PAT SR.	Randy, tell him what I'm doing.
M	RANDY	He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything. All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.
M	PAT SR.	Tell him why.
M	RANDY	Because he believes in you.
M	PAT	Is that true?
M	PAT SR.	I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that. So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	You understand?
M	PAT	Yeah.
M	PAT SR.	Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother.
M	PAT	You want me to go to the game with Jake?
M	PAT SR.	Of course I do.
F	JAKE	Does he want me to go?
M	PAT SR.	Of course he wants you to go.
M	PAT	He told you that?
M	PAT SR.	He told me, yes.
M	PAT	Even with all his friends?
M	PAT SR.	With all his friends. He trusts you.
M	PAT	He's not embarrassed?
M	PAT SR.	No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. `Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
M	RANDY	Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
M	PAT SR.	Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.
M	PAT	I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.
M	PAT SR.	What is this thing you're doing?
F	DOLORES	Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon?
M	PAT	It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.
M	PAT	Listen, I need to ask you something. Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?
F	TIFFANY	I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
M	PAT	Why?
F	TIFFANY	These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.
M	PAT	I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.
F	TIFFANY	Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
M	PAT	No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.
F	TIFFANY	Guess what?
M	PAT	What?
F	TIFFANY	Nikki replied to your letter. But you can't read it until after you nail the big move. Go.
M	PAT	Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?
F	TIFFANY	I just hope you can handle it.
M	PAT	Thank you. What was her energy when she gave it to you?
F	TIFFANY	She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
M	PAT	She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?
F	TIFFANY	Try to stay positive.
M	PAT	I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?
F	TIFFANY	No.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	I thought you were gonna read it out loud.
M	PAT	Okay. Sorry. "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	I think I'm done for today, okay?
F	TIFFANY	She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.
M	PAT	Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
M	PAT	Can I use your phone?
M	PAT SR.	Is it an emergency?
M	PAT	Yeah, kind of.
M	PAT SR.	What kind of emergency?
M	PAT	Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.
M	PAT SR.	Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know?
M	PAT	She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?
M	PAT SR.	That a bad thing?
M	PAT	No, I think, it's a good thing.
M	PAT SR.	Don't drink too much. Don't hit anybody. You'll be fine.
M	PAT	Yeah. I'm solid.
F	JAKE	This is my little brother Pat.
M	PAT	Hey, how you doing?
M	GUY #1	So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out?
M	GUY #2	(laughs) Yeah, from the looney bin!
F	JAKE	What the fuck?! I talked to you about that already! I told you guys-- It's all right.
F	JAKE	Huh? No.
M	PAT	It's alright.
M	GUY #2	He's a good dude! He's a good dude.
F	JAKE	Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!
M	JAKE (CONT'D)	They're here every week!
M	PAT	No!
M	GUY #1	Uh, Jake you better get your brother. Cuckoo bird's takin' off.
M	PAT	Doctor Patel!
F	DR. PATEL	Pat!
M	PAT	Hey! What are you doing here?
F	DR. PATEL	You know, we must beat the Giants, my brother.
M	PAT	I'm not supposed to be seeing you, right? Outside the office?
F	DR. PATEL	Pat, Pat.
M	PAT	That's illegal!
F	DR. PATEL	Pat, today I'm your brother in green, not your therapist. I'm so happy to see you. How wonderful that you are here!
M	PAT	Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.
F	JAKE	Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.
F	DR. PATEL	You can say that again. Those cocksuckers! DR. PATEL, PAT and JAKE LAUGH.
M	RONNIE	Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica `cause she does, but I don't want to talk to Veronica.
M	PAT	Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?
M	RONNIE	Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down.
M	PAT	You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.
M	RONNIE	You're right, man. You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, man.
M	FAN #1	Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!
M	FAN #1 (CONT'D)	What the fuck? What's that smell? Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby! Go back to your country!
M	PAT	What, what's wrong?
M	INDIAN MAN	Hey!
M	RONNIE	Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
F	JAKE	Stay back, Pat. Stay back.
M	JAKE (CONT'D)	Leave the fucking Indians alone.
M	RONNIE	Stay here, stay here!
M	PAT	I'm not gonna go anywhere.
M	RONNIE	Don't get in a fight!
M	PAT	I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight. Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey! Break it up or you'll be arrested!
M	PAT SR.	What'd you do? What happened? What the fuck happened?
M	PAT	Dad.
M	PAT SR.	The birds lose, I lose a fuckin' fortune, a fortune to Randy! What the fuck did you do?! You fucking lost it! I thought you said you had it together! You were solid!
M	PAT	I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now.
M	PAT SR.	You fell apart! What are you fucking talking about?!
F	DR. PATEL	Your son was trying to--
M	PAT SR.	It's all fucking ruined now. It's all ruined.
M	PAT	No, Dad! It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined!
M	PAT	No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't! It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!
M	PAT	No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad! You loser! You loser! I'm not a loser.
M	PAT SR.	You fucking loser! You ruined everything!
F	DR. PATEL	He was defending his brother!
M	PAT SR.	You fucking idiot! You spike the ball on the one yard line, you fucking idiot!
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Who is this?! Who's this?!
F	TIFFANY	We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
M	PAT	Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,
M	PAT SR.	Who is this? What is this?
F	TIFFANY	Oh, really?
M	PAT	Yes. I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--
F	TIFFANY	Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.
M	PAT SR.	What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
M	PAT	There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!
M	PAT SR.	She's fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here.
F	TIFFANY	You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?
M	PAT SR.	Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since-- You think that I'm why today's happened?
M	PAT SR.	That's right, you are why today happened.
F	TIFFANY	I'm the reason why today happened?
M	PAT SR.	I think so.
F	TIFFANY	Let's talk about that. PAT SR. Be my guest.
F	TIFFANY	The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
F	JAKE	She's right, Dad.
F	TIFFANY	The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.
M	PAT	Wow.
F	TIFFANY	The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
M	PAT	Oh, wow.
M	PAT SR.	Let me think about that. Wait a minute.
F	TIFFANY	Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.
M	PAT SR.	He was with you?
F	TIFFANY	He was with me. We went for a run.
M	RONNIE	Really? That's crazy.
F	TIFFANY	There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
F	JAKE	She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.
F	TIFFANY	Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."
F	DOLORES	Oh Pat.
F	TIFFANY	Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
M	RONNIE	Unbelievable.
M	PAT	Wow. How did you know all that stuff?
F	TIFFANY	I did my research.
M	PAT SR.	Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
F	TIFFANY	Thank you.
M	PAT SR.	I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do.
M	PAT	Oh, now you like her, Dad?
M	PAT SR.	I have to say I do. Yup.
M	RANDY	Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
F	TIFFANY	Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.
M	PAT	Is that right?
F	TIFFANY	You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!
M	RANDY	That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!
F	TIFFANY	You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, prove it, prove it!
M	RANDY	How do you want me to prove it?
M	PAT SR.	How's he gonna prove it?
F	TIFFANY	By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
M	PAT	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
M	RANDY	Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying?
F	TIFFANY	No.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Against the Cowboys.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	That's your team isn't it, Randy?
M	PAT	That's his team!
F	TIFFANY	I know who his team is.
M	RANDY	When is the game?
F	TIFFANY	December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
M	PAT	Oh, my God.
F	TIFFANY	Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
F	DOLORES	Oh God.
M	PAT SR.	Randy, I thought they were America's Team. Don't you believe in America's Team?
F	TIFFANY	Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
M	RANDY	Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
M	PAT SR.	I like it.
F	DOLORES	No. No, Patrizio--
M	PAT SR.	I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action. I'll take it.
M	PAT	Dad!
F	DOLORES	Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!
M	PAT SR.	I have faith, I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house--
M	PAT SR.	--not in the State of New York. In this house.
M	PAT	Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay?
M	PAT SR.	I didn't know, either, but now I know.
M	PAT	I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing--
M	PAT SR.	Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more.
F	DOLORES	Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet!
M	PAT SR.	In fact, I'll give you ten points.
M	PAT	No, Dad! Dad!
F	JAKE	Dad!
M	PAT SR.	You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.
M	RANDY	Dolores, would you stop him?
F	JAKE	Jesus!
M	PAT SR.	How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's that? Tiffany, what's that?
M	PAT	What? No, no, no, no.
M	RANDY	You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.
F	DOLORES	What? No parlay! No!
M	PAT	No, don't do it. Don't do it.
M	RANDY	Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything?
M	PAT	I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high- end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't--
F	TIFFANY	They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
M	RANDY	Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?
M	PAT	We suck.
F	TIFFANY	We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
M	RANDY	And how are the people you're competing against?
F	TIFFANY	They're good. Some of them are professionals.
M	RANDY	They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
M	PAT	A lot better.
M	RANDY	A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?
M	PAT	No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away--
F	TIFFANY	Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!
M	PAT	We can't get five!
M	PAT SR.	Give `em a five. Give `em a five.
F	TIFFANY	We can do a five.
M	PAT	What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!
M	RANDY	That's the parlay.
F	DR. PATEL	Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?
M	RONNIE	You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.
F	DR. PATEL	That's very, very manic indeed.
M	RONNIE	That's the parlay.
M	RANDY	Shake on it.
M	PAT	You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. (to Randy) Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.
F	TIFFANY	Pat, you can't quit.
M	PAT	I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.
F	TIFFANY	Pat, calm down. Thank about it.
M	PAT	See you later.
F	TIFFANY	Pat, no.
M	PAT SR.	What are you doing?
F	TIFFANY	Pat. I'm out. Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go.
M	PAT	What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.
F	TIFFANY	You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the
M	PAT	If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.
F	DOLORES	Pat!
F	TIFFANY	You are not a stand up guy!
F	DOLORES	Pat!
F	DOLORES	I told you not to push it.
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing. He can't be a quitter. He cannot be a quitter. You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.
F	TIFFANY	There's only one way to get him to show.
M	PAT SR.	What's that?
F	DOLORES	Oh, what's that?
F	TIFFANY	We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there. They stare at her.
F	DOLORES	She won't come. She can't come.
F	TIFFANY	We have to tell him that she's coming.
M	PAT SR.	We have to tell him that she's going.
F	DOLORES	But that's a lie!
F	TIFFANY	It's a white lie. PAT SR. It's a white lie, what's that matter? That's no big deal. So it's a little lie.
F	TIFFANY	There's no other way.
M	PAT SR.	You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
F	DOLORES	No. I don't approve. You can't do it.
M	PAT SR.	Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him. I didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway. That's it.
F	TIFFANY	We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there. You gotta be part of it.
F	TIFFANY	We have to do it.
F	DOLORES	Aren't you nervous to be lying?
F	TIFFANY	Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best. "...but if it was me reading the signs...." That's it.
F	DOLORES	Okay.
F	TIFFANY	Hey.
M	PAT	Hey, what's up? Sorry I'm late.
F	TIFFANY	It's fine.
M	TIFFANY'S MOTHER	Is everything all right?
M	PAT SR.	Everything is fine. Cheers.
F	TIFFANY	This isn't working!
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	Stupid!
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	This just isn't working!
M	PAT	Come on, it's gonna be great. Nikki's gonna be there. You know? Everything's gonna come together. It's what's meant to be. You okay?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Don't get wobbly on me.
F	TIFFANY	I'm not.
M	PAT	We have a dance to do. We have a parlay. You gotta stay focused.
F	TIFFANY	I'm focused.
M	PAT	Okay, let's go.
M	PAT	Look at the dancers. You see them?
F	TIFFANY	Shit.
M	PAT SR.	Hey, Randy, Jake. What do we got?
F	JAKE	Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three. I'm worried about the bet.
M	PAT SR.	Don't worry about the bet.
F	JAKE	I'm worried about the bet.
M	PAT SR.	Holy shit.
M	PAT SR. (CONT'D)	Is this "Dancing with the Stars"?
F	DOLORES	Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted `em. Look at those fucking dancers! You can give me the money now, you know? Patty, Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five. That's all. You stay here and watch the game with me.
F	TIFFANY	The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that.
M	PAT SR.	Stay for the next quarter.
M	PAT	Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay? I'll see you in a little bit. I'll see you up there, okay?
M	PAT SR.	Okay.
M	DANNY	Hey, Pat, Tiffany!
M	PAT	Hey.
M	DANNY	What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.
M	PAT	Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy, I'll see you. Alright. Wish me luck, man.
F	DR. PATEL	Excelsior! Pat and Tiffany walk to sign in.
M	PAT	hands) Wait, what's this?
F	TIFFANY	What? I thought you were doing it.
M	PAT	Oh, I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	You okay?
F	TIFFANY	I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.
M	PAT	Of course I do.
F	TIFFANY	Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.
M	PAT	Hi, good evening.
M	MALE OFFICIAL	Evening.
M	PAT	Check in? How many dancers are there? What?! Nikki? Nikki. Oh, Jesus. She seems devastated by Nikki actually being there for Pat. What the fuck?
F	VERONICA	Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.
F	TIFFANY	You're killing me. You're killing me!
F	VERONICA	Tiffany, please. She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order.
F	TIFFANY	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
M	RONNIE	Pat told me. He told me you should never throw a marriage out the window. Pat did not say that. He didn't say that.
M	RONNIE	He said it several times, Tiffany, and this is his chance. You gotta give him a chance.
F	TIFFANY	Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?
M	GUY AT BAR	So, you want another one?
F	TIFFANY	Sure.
M	TIFFANY (CONT'D)	So what do you do?
M	GUY AT BAR	I'm a lawyer. Litigator, actually.
F	TIFFANY	Oh, the arguing kind.
M	EMCEE (O.S.)	And the scores for Santos and Aguilar are: seven point six, seven point three, seven point four, and six point nine for an average score of seven point three. Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs.
M	DANNY	Randy, what the fuck is happening, man?!
M	PAT SR.	Yeah, Randy, what the fuck is happening?! Where's Tiffany?
M	PAT	I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?
F	DOLORES	You gotta find her.
M	PAT	I know, Mom, I know.
M	PAT (CONT'D)	Hey, WHAT are you doing?
M	GUY AT BAR	She's fine, buddy, she's with me.
M	PAT	She's fine?
M	GUY AT BAR	Yeah.
M	PAT	Why don't you shut up, okay?
M	PAT (CONT'D)	How many drinks have you had?
F	TIFFANY	I've had two vodkas.
M	PAT	Listen, I don't know what choices you've made, but you gotta deal with it right now, okay? We're in this.
F	TIFFANY	We're in what?
M	EMCEE	Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.
F	TIFFANY	You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.
M	PAT	Good for you. He pulls her out of her chair to go to the stage. TIFFANY AND

F	NIKKI	Of course.
M	PAT	How are you? You okay?
F	NIKKI	Good. How are you?
M	PAT	I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.
F	NIKKI	You looked really happy out there.
M	PAT	Did I?
F	NIKKI	Yeah.
M	PAT	Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing? Tiffany reacts from afar, stung.
F	NIKKI	You look incredible.
M	PAT	Thank you.
F	NIKKI	You lost a lot of weight.
M	PAT	I've been reading your books and, I have a positive attitude. I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.
M	PAT	Where's Tiffany?
M	PAT SR.	She left.
M	PAT	What do you mean, she left?
M	PAT SR.	She left. What do you think!
M	PAT	Where is she?
M	PAT SR.	Let me tell you, I know you don't wanna listen to your father, I didn't listen to mine but I'm telling you, you gotta pay attention to the signs. When life reaches out with a moment like this, it's a sin if you don't reach back. I'm telling you, it's a sin if you don't reach back, and it'll haunt you for the rest of your days like a curse. You're facing a big challenge in your life right now, at this very moment, right here. That girl loves you, she really loves you. And I don't know if Nikki ever did, but she sure as hell doesn't love you right now. I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.
M	PAT	I love you, Dad. Hey! Would you just leave me alone?!
M	PAT	Wait a second!
M	PAT (CONT'D)	I have one more letter for you to read, okay? What the fuck is the matter with you? Give it to her yourself!
M	PAT	Let me say something. You don't ever have to see me again if you just read it, alright?
F	TIFFANY	This is so fucked up.
M	PAT	Yeah, just read it. "Dear Tiffany... SHE STOPS, surprised it is addressed to her. "...I know you wrote the letter. (long pause) The only way you could meet my crazy...." "...was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I wrote that a week ago.
F	TIFFANY	You wrote that a week ago?
M	PAT	Yes, I did.
F	TIFFANY	You let me lie to you for a week?
M	PAT	I was trying to be romantic.
F	TIFFANY	You love me?
M	PAT	Yeah, I do.
F	TIFFANY	Okay. SHE LEANS FORWARD AND KISSES HIM, they kiss. Camera pulls The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed. And I can't begin to explain that- -or the craziness inside myself and everybody else, but guess what? Sunday is my favorite day again. I think of everything everyone did for me and I feel like --a very lucky guy.
M	PAT SR.	We have to beat the Vikings by three. I'm givin' you a six, which is very generous after the beating you just took. So what are we doin', what are we talkin' about here?
M	RANDY	I'd like to do another parlay if we make it to the next round, that's all.
M	PAT SR.	But we are gonna make it to the next round. We're gonna beat...
M	RONNIE	No, that was me that did that.
F	JAKE	No that was me.
M	RONNIE	That was me. I played the Jack.
M	DANNY	So you put the bread crumbs, the garlic in the steak and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
F	DOLORES	Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus. Everything's good, everything's good, yeah. I got you, you're all down. (pause) No, Randy, he's complaining. You know he lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning. The restaurant's happening because of Randy, so everything's good. TIFFANY SITS DOWN ON PAT'S LAP AND THEY TALK (we cannot hear
