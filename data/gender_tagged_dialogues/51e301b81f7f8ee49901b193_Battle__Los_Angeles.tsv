M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.)	Must be some kind of mistake... Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his
M	1ST SGT. ROY	I got paperwork here, with your signature, says you're retiring.
M	SGT. NANTZ	No mistake, John.
M	1ST SGT. ROY	My ass. You got a box full a', medals, file full a' commendations. Hell, everything but the Good Conduct.
M	SGT. NANTZ	They can take the Good Conduct Medal and shove it up their... See, that's what I'm talking about, Mike. You're a marine! Nantzsmiles back now.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I appreciate it, John. You know that. But, I been to too many funerals. Had to visit too many moms and dads, tell 'em about what happened to their sons...
M	1ST SGT. ROY	Look. You're on that training assignment right now. Why don't you just ride it out for a month or two. See how you feel...
M	SGT. NANTZ	I did my twenty. I'm done. Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out.
M	1ST SGT. ROY	You're gonna miss it. Nantz shakes.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Wanna bet? I don't see it...
M	VOICE #2 (O.S.)	I'm telling you, it's in the trees.
M	FIVE MARINES	From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5)..
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Screw it. I'm gonna launch another one... The other marines back away quickly as... The marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO -	That's more like it. PVT. LENIHAN, 18, baby-faced, looks impressed.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Sweet. PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but good-natured country boy, moves
M	PVT. IMLAY	Don't encourage him. Correggio's freakin' ego's big enough already. He takes the club from Correggio.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Let an expert show you how it's done, bro. Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated.
M	PVT. IMLAY (O.S.)	Mother fu... Then he stops as a LIGHT flashes beyond the trees.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Foot mobiles. 3 O'clock.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Told you they'd come! THREE GIRLS, 19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down
M	PVT. IMLAY	That dog'll hunt! Damn, Daktari, you can play! We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Well, how would I know? I mean, it's an American game.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish. PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.
M	PVT. KERNS	Lenihan, you as good with an M-16 as you are with your mouth?
M	PVT. IMLAY	Kerns. Lay off him.
M	PVT. KERNS	What? Just wanna make sure the rookie won't fold under fire. Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Relax, dude. He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an assfull a' shrapnel our last tour.
M	PVT. KERNS	I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your own ass 'cause we train with Sgt. Nantz tomorrow. Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say.
M	GIRL #1	what happens if they catch you out here? She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	We can handle it, baby. We're experts at night maneuvers. Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.
M	GIRL #2	So you're from where again? Imlay pops a beer, interrupting.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman. Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass. Daktari, tell her about Nigeria. Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again:
M	PVT. IMLAY	Adukwu's a green card marine... And Lenihan here-- He's just green. Mom signed so he could join at 17. I'm looking after him since he don't know his ass from a hot rock. Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.
M	GIRL #3	You're doing a good job.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Yeah. We always take the new meat out here to christen 'em... Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Hey, barfy. Grab your beer. toast. Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.
M	PVT. IMLAY	To Lenihan. Who gets his first taste a' those hills tomorrow. He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course.
M	PVT. KERNS	Good luck, rookie. The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	MPs! The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile...
M	INTO THE TAHOE	With the girls. The Tahoe skids away, the beer CRASHING off'
M	GIRL #1	Experts, huh? Correggio grins sheepishly. She smiles. sweetly, taking his
M	NEWSCASTER (ON TV)	.what appears to be an unprecedented meteor shower, falling off the Falkland Islands. LT. BENNIE MARTINEZ, 25, whose youthful looks and open smile
F	LT. MARTINEZ	What are you doing up so early? She holds up the object in her hands-- It's Martinez' Lieutenant. I still have to get used to that. She kisses him lightly, stands. Martinez smiles, watching
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Yeah, lot of things we gotta get used to. We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits.
M	NEWSCASTER (V.0.)	This dazzling display is visible from Argentina to Southern Chile.
M	ANNA	Call me later. I'll call you later. He stops, smiling back at her now. She waves coyly.
M	PVT. KERNS	Heard Nantz put in his papers. He's out.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Good. Wish he done it years ago. Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this, Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe his ass for him, too? Every man carries his weight! Nantz drops back, runs alongside the struggling Lenihan.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Just quit, Lenihan. Do us all a favor. 'Cause the squad's only as strong as the weakest man.,.. Lenihan STUMBLES and FALLS IN THE DIRT.
M	SGT. NANTZ	And right now you're getting us all killed. You hear? On these words, NANTZ MEETS EYES WITH CORREGGIO, further back
M	SGT. NANTZ	You think you're helping him, Imlay!? You think you're making him stronger?! Nantz puts a boot into Imlay's chest, shoving him flat.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay! You've just been gut-shot. Your buddy's down, bleeding to death, Lenihan. LZ's at the top of this hill. You gonna let this man die in the dirt on some stinking hill? Or are you marine enough to save him?! Lenihan stumbles to his feet, wiping dirt from his mouth.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	I'm gonna save him, sir! Lenihan bends, strains, somehow heaves Imlay up.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Come on, goddamnit! It's a hot LZ! The chopper's gotta move! They're gonna leave you BOTH to die!!! Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	I can't.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Don't you ever tell me you can't! Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now. Kerns stops him.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	He's injured, Sergeant. A moment as they stare at each other. Nantz, voice like ice:
M	SGT. NANTZ	He's not injured. He twisted his goddamn ankle. Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We are marines. "Can't" is not the code we live by. "Can't" gets marines killed. Do things the right way, the marine way, maybe you get to come home... Maybe your buddy gets to come home. Correggio stares back sullenly on this.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Dying's easy, ladies. Everything else takes balls. Nantz spits on the ground.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into Lenihan and tape that ankle. We start back in ten minutes.
M	NEWSCASTER (V.0.)	.meteors are falling off the coasts of California, Ireland, India, in the Bay of Bengal-- all less than ten miles from land...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Man, I thought Lenihan was gonna wash out today.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Hey, I remember carrying your fat ass up that hill hung over as shit. Newbie gets no sympathy from me. A woman, CHERISE, 22, Harris' fiancee, hurries over.
F	CHERISE	For three hundred more, she said we could have sprays of lilies. I know it's a lot, but it'd be so beautiful. What d'you think, baby? Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up:
M	CPL. STAVROU	Well, I think it's a no-brainer. You're only getting married once! What, are you gonna worry about three hundred bucks? Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back weakly.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Of course, baby. Whatever you want She kisses him, heads to the florist as Harris turns on
M	CPL. HARRIS	Dude, what are you doing?
M	CPL. STAVROU	Busting your balls. Tomorrow we shop for cake. Stavrou throws an arm round Harris' shoulder, smiles.
M	CPL. STAVROU	I love cake.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	Still not sleeping... And the nightmares?
M	PVT. KERNS	No. I mean, sometimes. But it's no big deal.
M	PSYCHIATRIST	You're not drinking, right, private? That's just a crutch...
M	PVT. KERNS	Alcohol? No, sir. Definitely not. The psychiatrist stares at this. Then WRITES in the file.
M	PVT. KERNS	So... What's my status? Am I cleared for combat? I feel good. Let's meet again next week. TWO MPs, on the beach, waving them in.
M	PVT. SIMMONS	I don't know why they always have to give us shit. It's not fair.
M	CPL. GRAYSTON	Question is, why does everybody think life's supposed to be fair? Why do bad guys want to kill us? Why can't I have a nipple ring? Why is it the more power we get, the more we want? Nothing's fair, Simmons. Whatever, Corporal. I just like to blow shit up. Suddenly, a SIREN begins WAILING from the base. Grayston and
M	SGT. NANTZ	Hold. The squad stops, following Nantz' gaze to... Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines. 1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:
M	1ST SGT. ROY	Marines! Into the trucks. Now. Proceed to the armory and draw weapons. The marines exchange glances, heading for the five-tons.
M	SGT. NANTZ	What's going on, John?
M	1ST SGT. ROY	Look, Mike, I know you're burnt out, ready to move on... Whatever you want to call it. But everybody's being deployed right now. And the platoon's down a sergeant. We need you.
M	SGT. NANTZ	For what? Do I have a choice here? They arrive at the Humvee. Roy turns to Nantz. No. You don't. It's all hands on deck, Mike. Nantz nods, resigned. Starts climbing into the Humvee.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Just don't lose my paperwork.
M	1ST SGT.. ROY	Meteor storm's hittin' up and down California now... All I know is, this is a helluva lot more than just some space rocks fallin' out to sea...
M	SGT. NANTZ	What d'you mean? He turns., stares at Nantz.
M	1ST SGT. ROY	Whole base is being mobilized. There's some kinda' bad shit hittin' the fan.
M	1ST SGT. ROY	You're assigned to 1st platoon, under Lt. Bennie Martinez. His platoon sergeant was rushing back to base, got in a car accident.
M	SGT. NANTZ	What are the odds? As the Humvee pulls to the COMMAND BUILDING, Nantz sees...
M	1ST SGT. ROY	There's the lieutenant. Young, been with us three months, straight outta basics school. Bright kid, but this is his first deployment, so keep an eye on him, Mike. Lenihan checks and double checks a LIST with the contents of
M	PVT. KERNS	It's probably just a drill, right?
M	PVT. IMLAY	They shifted Nantz into our unit. Something must be going on.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	I heard Nantz kicked ass on his last tour. Went into a compound by himself, killed, like, ten insurgents...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	That what you heard? You don't know shit, Lenihan. Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Move your asses. They want us in the armory. And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	What's his problem?
M	PVT. IMLAY	Nantz lost a lotta guys on that tour. Correggio's brother was one of 'em. Lenihan nods, somber, getting it. And every office has a TELEVISION on. We hear OVERLAPPING.
M	TV REPORTERS (V.0.)	.cluster of what appears to be meteors is tightly packed... hard for scientists to predict the size or quantity striking the oceans...
M	SGT. NANTZ	They calling us.in because of these meteors, Lieutenant?
F	LT. MARTINEZ	I assume so... Maybe an evacuation. Whatever it is, it'll be good to get out in the field with the men. Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Look, Sergeant, let's be clear. I know your rep, know what you've done... But this is my unit. We're not gonna have a problem, are we?
M	SGT. NANTZ	No problem, sir. It's all yours.
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	We never got a chance to finish the new mix, man. We were gonna add some metal to it...
M	PVT. GUERRERO	We'll have time later. The marines stare at the harried reporter on TV.
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	.National Guard troops have flown in to evacuate all surrounding beach areas... Yeah... Later.
M	CAPTAIN	These objects were completely undetected until they entered our atmosphere.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	So... what are they, Captain?
M	CAPTAIN	We have no idea. But whatever they are, they're not hitting the water at terminal velocity. They're able to slow down before impact. Glances exchanged in the room now.
M	CAPTAIN	This is no meteor shower. Homeland Security has bumped the threat level to red. Marines, we are the first line of defense. All units gear up, be ready to move. The REPORTER on the beach looks harried now as THICK SMOKE
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	.some sort of smoke has appeared over the ocean now...
M	CPL. HARRIS	Hey, shut up. Shut up! Others quiet down now. All focus slowly shifting to... The reporter on the beach is cupping her earpiece.
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	I'm being told a Coast Guard cutter just issued a Mayday... The TV SHOT PANS to the WATER...
M	THE MARINES	Push forward, scrambling to the TVs.
M	PVT. KERNS	What the hell are those things?!
M	ON THE TV:	The CUTTER DISAPPEARS behind the thick rolling SMOKE. Right now, ACTIVITY HAS CEASED. Marines silently stare at...
M	TELEVISIONS	The REPORTER ON THE BEACH staring out, clearly panicked.
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	It appears... the cutter has...
M	TELEVISIONS	As the REPORTER reacts to isolated SHOUTS echoing from the
M	REPORTER (ON TV)	What is that...? In the water... The news cameraman PANS to the WATER as it begins to CHURN. SCREAMS and panicked voices ring out from those ON THE BEACH
F	LT. MARTINEZ	As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz will be taking over for Sgt. Beck. We're lucky to have him aboard. The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Let's move, men!, The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on... Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.
M	SGT. NANTZ	You got something to get off your chest, Corporal?
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got a Silver Star and my brother came home in a box. I get it. Beat.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Get aboard, Corporal. Correggio jumps into the chopper. The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some
M	PVT. GUERRERO	What the hell you think those things are?
M	CPL. HARRIS	Gotta be extraterrestrial.
M	PVT. IMLAY	You mean, like, from space?!
M	CPL. STAVROU	No, Imlay. From Canada. Correggio looks down at his hand... Sees the GIRL'S PHONE ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Santa Monica airport's our Forward Operating Base. We get some Cobras and F-18s in the air, we'll have plenty of support. Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez
M	PVT. KERNS	How many a' them you think there are, Sergeant? Nantz just stares out, stone-faced.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We'll know soon enough, private. Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a The CH-46 LANDS. The platoon JUMPS OUT, squad leaders forming the men up as...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of the 2/5.
M	CAPTAIN	Situation is as follows: Most of Santa Monica is cleared of civilians. We've got a defensive line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile from the ocean... He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by.
M	CAPTAIN	At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln to the ocean will be bombed. Martinez blanches.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	We're... leveling it, Captain?
M	CAPTAIN	We've got an infestation of god- knows-what. It's an enemy ground force only, they have no aircraft. So our jets'll tear 'em a new asshole. We will rule the air.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	But... there must be civilians stuck behind the line, sir.
M	CAPTAIN	That's affirm. We're getting distress calls, sending squads out.
M	CAPTAIN	Your mission, Lieutenant, take your 1st squad, proceed west from Lincoln to a community center located here... In a park on 10th and Bay Street. Police were using it as an evacuation point. They got overrun. Get there, any civilians you find, get 'em back here to the FOB for evacuation. You got three hours. Another CHOPPER is LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:
M	SGT. NANTZ	What do we know about these things, Captain?
M	CAPTAIN	Not much. But police have shot 'em. They bleed. The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:
M	CAPTAIN	It's our job to kill 'em. Martinez turns, rallies the squad, most of whom look shocked.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Let's go, marines! Clock's running. Focus on the mission. We're gonna get to that community center and get those people safe. A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing into the
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Something to add, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Kill anything that's not human. The ground SHAKES from massive AFTERSHOCKS. Billowing SMOKE
M	PVT. KERNS	What the hell is that?!
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Keep it together. Watch your angles. The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Helluva way to get citizenship, eh, Daktari?
F	ADUKWU	Shit, I'd rather be in Afghanistan. THICK SMOKE hangs in the air. The lack of visibility is Numerous SHAPES become visible in the smoke.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Cherise and I were supposed to register at Bed, Bath & Beyond tonight...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Think you're gonna be busy, bro. Nantz points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck:
M	PVT. SIMMONS	What is that shit, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Something bad, private. Now get back with your team.
M	PVT. KERNS	Whoa, whoa... Contact! Twelve o'clock! A SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Relax, man. Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on. But the dog suddenly RACES OFF, disappearing into the smoke.
M	PVT. IMLAY	What the hell...?
M	CPL. HARRIS	Something spooked that dog... Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET...
M	PVT. KERNS	Contact! Contact! Discipline shatters as the squad follows Kerns...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Marines! Hold your position! Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged,
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	What'd you see?! Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.
M	SGT. NANTZ	One enemy runs and you break discipline and chase it?! Think, marines. Stay alive.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	The sergeant is right. Stay on course. We have a mission... Suddenly, the SHADOWY ALIEN FORM RISES again, darting off, The squad stares back, stunned. Holy shit.
M	CPL. HARRIS	How many rounds it take?
M	CPL. STAVROU	Enough. Correggio edges to Kerns, who's looking panicky.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	You okay?
M	PVT. KERNS	They're real, bro. I kept prayin' they wouldn't be...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Quiet. Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	What is it, sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	That thing running down the street... That was to draw us in... Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now...
M	SGT. NANTZ	They're coming. We took the bait, now they're cutting us off.
M	PVT. KERNS	I can't see a goddamn thing! But the SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there's many.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Light it up! The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as... TRACER FIRE shoots back at the marines from the smoke.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Mottola, get on the radio. See if we can get some air support. Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'..
M	PVT. SIMMONS	Contact front! Contact front! Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	What are we shooting at?!
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	Lieutenant. Command says air power is totally committed. Enemy contact all over the area... Martinez stares back at this ominous news as...
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Ahh, shit! It's burning! His HELMET is being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is My face, man...! How's my face?
M	PVT. IMLAY	Ugly as ever, bro. The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available-- Martinez drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it Chaos as ENEMY TRACER FIRE increases, exploding around them. Fall back! Here! He leads them further down the side street.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We can hold this position, Lieutenant!
F	LT. MARTINEZ	We're gonna get pinned down!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Sir, these things seem to be operating tactically! Don't let them dictate your decisions... Move to live, marines! The squad follows Martinez, retreating... JUST A SIDEWALK separates the houses opposite each other.
M	SGT. NANTZ	It's an ambush. This is the kill zone! Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward. On Nantz' order, the SQUAD OPENS FIRE just as... Martinez is shouting orders, directing the men as... Kerns backs against a fence, overwhelmed by the chaos. ; He Correggio steps in front of Kerns, firing to protect him., Guerrero, Imlay and Simmons lay down an awesome barrage with
M	PVT. SIMMONS	Jesus! Oh my God!
M	CPL. STAVROU	Keep your shit together!
M	PVT. SIMMONS	What the hell are those things?!
M	CPL. HARRIS	They're the goddamn enemy.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Yeah, and there's a million of 'em!
M	PVT. SIMMONS	Where'd they come from?! Why'd they come here?!
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Everyone... just calm down.
M	PVT. SIMMONS	Calm down?! We keep shooting them... Why don't they die?!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Stow that shit, Private. Watch the yard. Secure the back. We're not dyin' here today. The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	You okay? Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods.
M	CPL. GRAYSTON	I know. These things'll kill me. Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically:
M	CPL. GRAYSTON	Hell, now that just ain't fair. Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded
M	SGT. NANTZ	Sir, what are your orders? Martinez turns, stares at Nantz.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	I led us right into that ambush.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Sir. Your orders. Beat. Martinez nods.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Let's figure out how we get out of here. We'll medevac the wounded from that park. Nantz nods, turns to Mottola.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at that park by the community center. As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero,
M	PVT. GUERRERO	I can't see, Motorola. Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice.
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	You'll be okay. A slight beat. Then...
M	PVT. GUERRERO	You're one shitty liar, bro.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?! Everyone stops, stares.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I'll go for Lenihan, sir.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	All right. We'll package the wounded, then rally on 10th street. Mottola, Imlay. Go with the sergeant. The two quickly step to Nantz.
M	PVT. IMLAY	We got your six, Sergeant. Anything you need. What I need is for you to keep quiet. And stay close.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Right. Got it. Quiet.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Starting now, Private. As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Motorola? You copy? His RADIO buzzes back with Nantz' voice:
M	SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)	Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz...
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Sergeant, Jesus, I had to turn the radio off..'. These things are everywhere! We're coming for you, Lenihan. What's your location?
M	PVT. LENIHAN	I'm in a garage... I can see two palm trees right next to it. House is white with black shutters... Just as something BANGS against the garage.
M	SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)	Is the house a two-story? Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.
M	SGT. NANTZ (V.O.)	Lenihan, is the house a...? Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF. Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His
M	SGT. NANTZ	Lenihan...? Lenihan...? Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as... The marines crouch, weapons up, straining to see through the The sound fades into the distance. CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN. Nothing there. As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool. An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool. BLISTERING GUNFIRE! As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up. Oh my God... What the hell are these things?
M	PVT. IMLAY	They're butt ugly, that's what they are. Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're gonna get you to the medevac, Private.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Thank you, Sergeant. Thanks for coming for me.
M	SGT. NANTZ	But Lenihan...
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Yes, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Ever get separated from your unit again, I'll find you and shoot you myself.
M	PVT. LENIHAN	Yes, Sergeant. Imlay slings Lenihan's arm around his shoulder and they're
F	LT. MARTINEZ	All right, let's get to the community center... They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK!
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go! Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	You guys are 2/5?
M	MARINE	2nd squad, 3rd platoon...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Where's the rest of your unit?
M	MARINE	This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone else is dead or missing. The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz.
M	MARINE	We were on the street, like, ten minutes and they ambushed us. As soon as we radioed for help, it's like they were everywhere... Medevac's incoming, lieutenant.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	All right. Stay with us. And the squad moves out... The specter of LIGHTS is thrown onto the field, an other
M	A MEDEVAC HELICOPTER	Descending steadily, its thundering rotors whipping the air..
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Load the wounded. Sgt. Nantz, Cpl. Harris-- let's find the civilians. Martinez, Nantz and Harris run to the community center as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines! A clattering. The marines immediately move toward it, Then the DOOR to a side room OPENS to reveal...
M	SGT. NANTZ	How many of you? A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45, jacket and tie, behind her.
F	MICHELE	There's five of us. Three kids. Nantz is immediately moving.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Where? Where are the kids? He pushes past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.
M	CREWMAN	You called in with two wounded!
M	PVT. IMLAY	We got four!
M	CREWMAN	Can't take four! We have no room!
M	CPL. STAVROU	Make goddamn room! A beat. The crewman relents in the face of Stavrou's Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on.
M	PVT. GUERRERO	I'll work on that mix for you.
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	Thanks, dude. Think I'm gonna need it. Lenihan crawls onto the chopper's deck with Imlay's help. You just had to get outta the shit. Lenihan smiles back.
M	CREW CHIEF	Now! We're moving now! Imlay bumps fists with Lenihan, backs away as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Wait! Stavrou, hold it! KIDS! Stavrou tries to hold the chopper, screaming at it as... Nantz, Martinez and Harris run to the chopper with the kids. The CHOPPER GAINS ALTITUDE as suddenly... The devastating energy wave blasts it END-OVER-END... Nantz turns ominously as an unearthly BUZZING SOUND FADES IN. He pulls on them, urging them to the COMMUNITY CENTER doors. Speeding toward Lincoln. FIRING PULSING WAVES OF ENERGY,
M	PVT. KERNS	Goddamn flying saucers now...?!
F	ADUKWU	All those guys on the chopper...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Why'd those bastards have to come down here and start this shit?!
M	SGT. NANTZ	That is not relevant, Imlay! They're here. They're trying to kill us. Kill them first! Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders:
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Secure the perimeter! Stavrou, give me an ammo check. Cpl. Correggio, take three men, set up an Observation Post on the roof.
M	SGT. NANTZ	You heard the lieutenant. Move! The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see
F	LT. MARTINEZ	They got air power, too... Knocked that medevac right out of the sky. So much for ruling the air. Nantz just keeps staring out.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Listen, Sergeant. These men are scared. A little compassion would go a long way... Nantz turns on Martinez now.
M	SGT. NANTZ	How's that gonna help them survive, Lieutenant? I'll lead these marines. But don't ask me to get close to them. Nantz walks off. Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first. Then
F	AMY	You're not gonna leave us, are you? A beat. Then Imlay smiles.
M	PVT. IMLAY	No way, sweetheart. The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling
M	RINCON	My son and I came here... There were only three cops, spread pretty thin... Then those things attacked. Police couldn't stop them.
M	SGT. NANTZ	What happened to everyone?
M	RINCON	I don't know. Most people ran. We hid in a side room, found Michele and the girls... Couldn't see what happened. Just heard... Screams.
F	MICHELE	I have my nieces for the week. My sister and her husband are in Hawaii for their anniversary... Is it safe there? I heard this is happening in other places... Martinez is at a loss for words.
F	MICHELE	What do they want from us? Why are they here?
F	LT. MARTINEZ	I...don't know. Right now, our job is just to get you to safety, okay? Harris appears from the hallway.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Lieutenant, something you should see... An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets. Then Hector notices Imlay standing nearby.
M	HECTOR	Want some Nerds? Imlay holds his hand out. Hector shakes candy into it as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Adukwu, bring your kit. Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're gonna cut one of these things open. See if we can figure out what makes 'em tick. Michele overhears, offering:
F	MICHELE	Maybe I can help, sergeant. I'm a vet...
M	SGT. NANTZ	You're a veteran?
F	MICHELE	No, a veterinarian.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Oh... Okay. Well, thanks, um... Nantz has forgotten her name. She smiles.
F	MICHELE	Michele.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Right. Michele. Sorry. Mottola walks up.
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	Sergeant. Can't raise anybody on the radio. We're cut off. Off Nantz' look... O.P. reporting. We're clear up here. Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	.fucking aliens. Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity
M	PVT. KERNS	You think those things get scared? They're probably just grunts like us. Probably dumped into battle, told to go fight... Kerns looks out... The constant thud and crack of warfare...
M	PVT. KERNS	I thought I could handle it...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	You are handling it. Thing I'm worried about is Nantz.
M	PVT. KERNS	Sergeant saved our ass at that ambush... He knows what he's doing.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Yeah? Tell my brother that. Michele stops, stares. She and Adukwu are both taken aback
M	SGT. NANTZ	You sure you can do this?
F	MICHELE	I was more sure two minutes ago. She looks to Adukwu. They step to the body together as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	What's the plan, Lieutenant?
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Mission is still to get the civilians to the Forward Operating Base. We've got a battalion there, all that firepower... I was thinking, I saw a bus couple of blocks back on 11th...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Maybe we should stay on foot. Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to
F	LT. MARTINEZ	The FOB is here, at the airport... That's miles to cover with those kids... And those bombs are gonna drop in a little more than an hour. We've got to move fast.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We have no radio contact, nothing to let us know the best route to take... And a bus is a big target.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	I made the call, Sergeant. It's my responsibility. Beat. Then Nantz nods, turns.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs recon on a.bus. It was abandoned two blocks south off 11th...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	If it runs, get it back here.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Can you hotwire a bus?
M	CPL. HARRIS	He's from Jersey, sergeant. A nod from Nantz on this.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Stavrou, Harris...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)	.you're clear down 11th Street. They exchange a quick glance.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Every day a holiday, buddy...
M	CPL. HARRIS	.every meal a feast. They slip outside, running off silently.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	How's it going?
F	ADUKWU	Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr. McDermott's a vet... We weren't sure who was most qualified to cut this thing open. Martinez smiles.
F	ADUKWU	Look. It's been surgically modified... He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is
F	ADUKWU	Part of its arm has been amputated to fit this weapon.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Talk about commitment to cause. Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the
F	LT. MARTINEZ	What is that thing?
M	PVT. IMLAY	He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not a different solar system. Nantz looks over at Imlay.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Thank you, private. Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Whoa, that stinks! Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she
M	PVT. IMLAY	I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm gonna puke!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Whatever you do, do it quietly, Imlay.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Hey, Stavs...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Relax. First thing I wired was a school bus. Trying to impress this Betty. She had a huge rack...
M	CPL. HARRIS	Enemy scout. Move your ass. Stavrou doesn't look up. Just works diligently.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Don't rush genius.
M	PVT. KERNS	Shit. You seeing what I'm seeing? Correggio pulls BINOCULARS... POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: A SIDE STREET, TREES overhanging it. Movement. ALIEN SHAPES massing on the side street. Harris. Movement, 1500 meters up 11th. Suddenly, a loud BANG rings out below them.
M	PVT. KERNS	What the hell was that?! They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof. Something vaguely METALLIC is revealed within it.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Looks like it's receiving a signal... Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding, Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm
F	LT. MARTINEZ	This thing's still alive! Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO The organ stops vibrating. The glow fades. The body slumps.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Not so hard to kill when you know where to aim. Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	Lieutenant. There's a breach. They in the building?
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	No clue, Sergeant. An exterior door was broken open.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather the civilians in the gym.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Good idea, Sergeant.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)	Harris, hostiles advancing right at you. Approximately two hundred meters and closing...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Done! Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus. Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops Nantz stands, staring DOWN THE DARK HALL with his M-16,
F	LT. MARTINEZ	We're in it together, Sergeant. Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here! Mottola is on the radio, frantic:
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	Where the hell is that bus?!
M	CPL. HARRIS	Get this thing started.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Hey, why didn't I think a' that?
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're out of time! Martinez looks INTO THE GYM, sees the kids staring back.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Go! Get 'em out! Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out.
M	IN THE LOBBY	Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as... Nantz, in the front, exchanges a glance with Martinez at the A PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE rising in the distance. Screech to a halt at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and Jesus Christ. Those alien ships took the whole line out.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We've got forty minutes 'til they level this area. Get us to the Forward Operating Base. Fast. Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the
M	PVT. MOTTOLA	Where the hell are all our jets?
M	PVT. IMLAY	Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna take a bus? We're sittin' ducks.
M	SGT. NANTZ	The call's been made, private. You so eager to decide the fate of all these people? Imlay is stone silent.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Didn't think so. Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Everybody get down, weapons inside the bus. Make no noise. The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low Then another, and another, and another... All heading east. Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES! All stations this net, urgent traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft moving east... As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	It's coming back...! The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low
M	SGT. NANTZ	Kill that radio! Mottola turns off the radio. The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment.
M	SGT. NANTZ	They're tracking our signals! All radios, cell phones-- keep everything off! Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	It's still coming... It's searching... Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO. He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten,
M	SGT. NANTZ	Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair thing? She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.
F	KIRSTEN	My... pony holder? Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair,
M	SGT. NANTZ	Anything happens, Lieutenant, get the SAWS up front and take off with these kids.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Sergeant... Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay, it's all gonna be okay. Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling Nantz flattens himself to the street as... Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART! NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE. That ship was an unmanned drone, lieutenant. And that alien we cut open had something in it receiving signals... They must have one helluva command and control center. Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	That was some real John Wayne shit, Sergeant. Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Don't do it again. We work as a team, Sergeant. We clear? Beat. Nantz nods.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're clear, Lieutenant. Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:
M	PVT. IMLAY	Who's John Wayne? Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts half the distance off our drive.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll be exposed...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	It doesn't seem like we're much safer out here. We've got two shitty options-- I'm choosing the one that gets us there fastest. We don't want to be in this area when the bombs start to fall. The BATTLE FRONT is moving east... A DEFENSIVE LINE of TANKS
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Jesus... Double time, Corporal. The bus barrels forward, careening BETWEEN CARS, knocking
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Take the next exit. Head south. We're two clicks from the FOB. The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles.
F	MICHELE	Your head, Sergeant. You're bleeding. Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on
F	MICHELE	Bet when you woke up this morning, you didn't think your day would end up like this.
M	SGT. NANTZ	That's a pretty safe bet.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Hostiles. Back up. Now, go! Stavrou guns the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Guess you were right, Sergeant.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Incoming! Down! Down! Down! A projectile EXPLODES next to the bus! Sending CARS FLYING! Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to do...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Let's dismount, set up a perimeter, get the civilians down to the street.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure the street! Kerns, Adukwu, help get the civilians off the freeway. Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Harris, Imlay, give us overwatch up on the roof. The rest of you push out 20 meters, set up a perimeter.
M	SGT. NANTZ	And don't forget, aim chest, right! Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus
M	SGT. NANTZ	Stay here with the civilians. As soon as Stavrou gives the sign, get them down to the street! Adukwu nods. Nantz starts off the bus.
M	HECTOR	Are we gonna die? Nantz turns back to Hector. Manages a smile.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Course not, kid, we're the good guys. And Nantz is off the bus.
M	PVT. IMLAY	I got about three dozen hostiles, twelve o'clock. 300 meters now. Coming fast.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets! This might get up-close and personal! Just a low CLATTERING now, the battle-rattle of Nantz and his
M	SGT. NANTZ	Cpl. Harris!
M	CPL. HARRIS	Sir!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Being vastly outnumbered provides a marine rifleman with what?
M	CPL. HARRIS	A target rich environment, sir!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Marines. We stand here. Let these bastards know who they're fucking with. Sporadic FIRE now, as the marines fire on the advancing Kerns covers him above, from the freeway. Stavrou hits the ground, securing the area. He looks up at
F	ADUKWU	Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go. Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries
F	MICHELE	It's okay. I'll be right behind you. Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.
M	PVT. KERNS	It's gonna be scary but we can do it, okay? An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls... Rincon
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Come on!! Come on!! Get some! Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him.
M	RINCON	It's okay, son. I got you. Rincon starts to PULL Mottola TOWARD THE OFF-RAMP... Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as... Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
M	RINCON	What do I need to know? The slightest beat, then...
M	SGT. NANTZ	It's set to fire in three round bursts. We're low, so don't waste your shots. Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.
M	RINCON	Just sight down the barrel...?
M	SGT. NANTZ	And give 'em hell. Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in
M	BY THE FREEWAY OFF-RAMP	Adukwu sees Rincon and the wounded Mottola now. He runs to Adukwu bends over Mottola, seeing that he's dead. Adukwu An ALIEN APPEARS from behind a car, AIMING STRAIGHT AT BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
M	PVT. ADUKWU	Keep fighting! Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as... Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's More WAVES OF ALIENS coming, using abandoned cars as cover...
M	CPL. HARRIS	Shit, Lieutenant, we're gonna be overrun ! Nantz and Martinez exchange a desperate glance on this. Then
M	SGT. NANTZ	Gimme two of your smoke cannisters! Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Take someone to cover you!. Nantz turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way,
M	SGT. NANTZ	Kerns! Come on!
M	PVT. KERNS	Me, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	I'm not worried about fightin' next to you, Kerns. Now let's go. A slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz... Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV. Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the
M	SGT. NANTZ	Get ready to move on my word. Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Now! Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Again! Ready?!
M	PVT. KERNS	Ready! Nantz drops the fuse, they run... The CAR EXPLODES in flames! He's creating a WALL OF FLAME... Funneling the enemy into Forcing them through the OPENING between the CARS ON FIRE...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Damn, Sergeant sure as shit's ninja. He just gave us a kill zone, didn't he, Corporal?
M	CPL. HARRIS	Soon as they come through, blow 'em back to hell! The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR. Imlay Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers, Martinez looks around... The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	Pull the men back... Pull 'em all back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay and cover. Nantz looks at Martinez about to say something. Sees the
M	SGT. NANTZ	Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta here. No way we're leavin' you...
F	LT. MARTINEZ	I said I got it...
M	SGT. NANTZ	I'm not leaving you here to die.
F	LT. MARTINEZ	That's not your call, Sergeant. Now get your men outta here... He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're pulling back. Head to the lower street, now! NOW! Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining What about the lieutenant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Keep movin', corporal! Go! All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus. This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez', U.S. Marine Corps! Aliens converge toward the back of the bus. 1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines! He turns, sees Nantz coming back for him... Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus... Nantz turns, dives for cover as... Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank...
M	ALL THE ALIENS DEAD.	His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him,
M	SGT. NANTZ	Package Mr. Rincon for transport. We've got to move...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt. Martinez back there?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Lt. Martinez stayed behind. He knew he was dying...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	So you left him? Is that how it is with you?
M	SGT. NANTZ	He sacrificed himself to save our asses. Now you get your head straight, Corporal. This is my unit now. Nantz looks at the men, who stare back, shaken. Let's move. We need shelter... Those bombs are gonna drop!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Tighten this place down. See if we can establish communications. Hard line only! Nothing wireless. The marines move into position, covering windows and doors.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Listen, we're out of the bomb zone... But when they fall, we will definitely be rocked. Make sure the kids are prepared for that. Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay and
M	SGT. NANTZ	It'll be okay. We'll get your dad fixed up. But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the
M	RINCON	Listen to me, son. I'm not going to make it. But you will.
M	HECTOR	I don't want to go without you.
M	RINCON	I know. But you have to. Now wait with Michele a minute. Let me talk to the sergeant. Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Mr. Rincon, we can take you and... Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.
M	MR. RINCON	Don't waste time, sergeant. You and I both know what's going on here.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I can't leave you...
M	RINCON	No. You can't take me. Nantz is silent, at a loss.
M	ACROSS THE STORE	Imlay stares at a CLOCK on the wall, calls out:
M	PVT. IMLAY	Four minutes and those bombs drop, Sergeant. NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank.
M	RINCON	I keep playing it over in my head... If I'd done things differently... Maybe I could have gotten Hector out earlier.
M	SGT. NANTZ	You can't look back. You make the best decision you can... A beat.
M	RINCON	Just promise you'll get my son out of here, Sergeant. Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I promise. Rincon holds out his hand. Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.
M	RINCON	I'm trusting you with the only thing I have in this world. Nantz stares, nods.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Sergeant! Hard wire connection! Nantz turns to see Harris behind a COUNTER, at a COMPUTER-- The marines crowd around, reading the ominous HEADLINE...
M	CPL. HARRIS	Damn, that's Cherise... Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok?' Harris responds: 'where are you?' He hits SEND. But the message doesn't go through. He clicks Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen. HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open
M	RINCON	I'm very proud of you, son. You're being so brave... Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him
M	RINCON	I love you, Hector. Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent,
M	PVT. IMLAY	Thirty seconds!
M	CPL. STAVROU	Get away from the windows! Get those kids behind cover! The marines back away from the windows into the center of the
M	PVT. KERNS	C'mon. Fry those bastards...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Those bombs drop, then everything's gonna change. Get to the FOB, get some goddamn ammo...
M	PVT. KERNS	Some goddamn food...
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Some goddamn tanks. Beat. Everyone stares as... The CLOCK ticks to NINE...
M	AND NOTHING HAPPENS.	They wait. Fear grows on everyone's faces.
M	PVT. KERNS	They shoulda' dropped, right? We'd feel it from here, wouldn't we?
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	That much ordinance? They'd feel it in Nevada. Something's wrong...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned the tide...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Yeah, right, Imlay... 'Cause we were kickin' ass out there.
F	MICHELE	What's happening, Sergeant? What's that mean?
M	SGT. NANTZ	I don't know. Adukwu quietly approaches Nantz now, voice low.
M	PVT. ADUKWU	Sergeant... Mr. Rincon is dead. Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Jesus... Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing
M	SGT. NANTZ	Listen, our Forward Operating Base is about a mile away. We have to go on foot. I'll need your help with Hector now. Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I'm sorry Hector. Your dad... didn't make it. You understand? Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at
M	HECTOR	I don't wanna be here. I want my dad back. I want it all to go back to the way it was before...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Sergeant, we got hostiles in front. All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Me too, Hector. I wish it could go back, too...
M	CPL. STAVROU	Out of time, sergeant.
M	NANTZ	Tries to lead Hector away. Hector struggles. We have to go, Hector. No! No! I want my dad!!! Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector's face, stricken, staring CRASH! The plate glass window is SHATTERED as... The alien is very still, peering around. Then it begins to A SECOND ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into Nantz peers out a BACK DOOR. It's clear. They MOVE OUT just MORE ALIENS leap in. They move in formation THROUGH THE THE BACK DOOR silently shuts.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Stavrou, Harris.
M	CPL. HARRIS	Yes, Sergeant.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Blow something up.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Yes, Sergeant. As the others RACE AWAY down the alley... Harris pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Don't think they'll be comin' out that way... As... BOOM! The car, blocking the door, goes up in FLAMES.
M	DOWN THE ALLEY	Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A BUILDING with the others.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Check it out. The two marines run down the alley to the SIDE STREET.
M	SGT. NANTZ	This is the hardest thing you'll ever have to do... Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.
M	SGT. NANTZ	But we'll get through it together. I promise, Hector. Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Looks good, both directions. Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with
M	SGT. NANTZ	We are not losing one more of these civilians. Period. Am I making myself clear? Let's move. The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY.
M	CPL. STAVROU	You okay, bro?
M	CPL. HARRIS	I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get married, she'd still be in Chicago. Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Under the cars! Now! The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE Rounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling
M	PVT. IMLAY	How far, sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	One block over. Imlay smiles at Kerns.
M	PVT. IMLAY	We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're gonna make it... But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a
F	MICHELE	What's the matter?
M	SGT. NANTZ	The smell. An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as... We slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz. A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from
M	SANTA MONICA AIRPORT.	As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Jesus... They wiped our Forward Operating Base right off the map.
M	PVT. KERNS	Now we know why those bombs never dropped. They took our jets out.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	This was a dug-in marine Corps position that had armor, air and ground. Maybe we got nothing left to fight with... Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything-- Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Let's get under cover. Now.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Lock this place down. The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	You're a brave kid. When this is over, you're going to be a hero.
M	HECTOR	People always say that. "He's a hero." No one even knows what a hero is.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Your dad was a hero. Hector just stares back.
M	SGT. NANTZ	He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that freeway. Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes
M	SGT. NANTZ	You save a marine under fire, you get a medal, y'know. Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it.
M	SGT. NANTZ	This is our medallion. It's yours. For your dad. You're 2/5 now, Hector. Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to
M	HECTOR	What's that mean, "retreat hell?"
M	SGT. NANTZ	During World War I, an officer from our regiment was ordered to retreat. He said, "Retreat? Hell, we just got here!" Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now.
M	CPL. HARRIS	We're secure, sergeant. Nantz stands on this, addresses the marines:
M	SGT. NANTZ	Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns, Adukwu stay with the civilians. The rest of us, let's move. Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I'll be right back. As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of
M	PVT. IMLAY	Sorry, bro. He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Sorry, bro. Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead
M	CPL. STAVROU	Looks like it just rolled off the goddamn assembly line!
M	PVT. IMLAY	Good job, Sergeant! Can you drive this thing?
M	CPL. STAVROU	Hell, if it's got an engine, sergeant, I can drive it.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Good. Get it running.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Seems like vehicles are targets...
M	SGT. NANTZ	A minivan's a target, Correggio. A LAV with a Bushmaster chaingun... That's an asset. Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Come on. Me? Where, sergeant? Nantz points to the CONTROL TOWER, its windows blown out.
M	SGT. NANTZ	High ground. We need to see the big picture.
M	PVT. KERNS	My dad's a fireman. They love their ice cream. Used to visit the firehouse with my little brother, they always had tons of it... My brother's not much older than these guys.
F	MICHELE	You don't look much older, either. She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.
F	MICHELE	Is this day ever going to end?
M	PVT. KERNS	Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way outta here. What's with you guys anyway? Doesn't anybody have a first name?
F	ADUKWU	Emmanuel. Manny.
M	PVT. KERNS	Pete. You married? Family?
F	MICHELE	I'm single. Lots of family back in Nebraska, though... Hopefully they're safe... She shakes the thought away.
F	MICHELE	What about you guys?
M	PVT. KERNS	Little Rock.
F	ADUKWU	Nigeria. I came here to be a doctor.
F	MICHELE	You should be a surgeon, the way you cut into that thing... Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around.
F	ADUKWU	Yeah. Maybe... On one desk, a COMPUTER is flashing a SLIDESHOW: Happy From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles... Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Look how far east they've gotten. That's almost the whole city... Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS: Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills...
M	SGT. NANTZ	What the hell's that? Imlay peers out.
M	SGT. NANTZ	There's zero activity there. And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No
M	PVT. IMLAY	What are we gonna do, Sergeant? Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then
M	SGT. NANTZ	That must be the alternate extraction site. Maybe we can evacuate the civilians there... He turns to Imlay.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Get them in the LAV. I'll radio for an evac helicopter... When I do, they'll be coming, so we have to move fast.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Think we can make it, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're gonna give it one helluva try, Imlay. He reassures the young marine with each-word:
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're not dying here. Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November. I have four civilians and seven marines, we're heading to Alternate Extraction Point Charlie. Requesting evacuation. I say again, this is Foxtrot 2 November heading to Alternate Extraction Point Charlie. Out. Nantz turns immediately, hurrying out. He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Use the thermal sight. No lights. Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs... He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN. Imlay beside him on the 25MM
M	BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.	Headlights off, running dark, Stavrou drives, peering through
M	STAVROU'S POV THROUGH THERMAL	Washed green, the city a war zone, massive destruction..
M	IN THE TURRET	Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Extract site's only a couple more miles, Imlay. Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...
M	THERMAL SIGHT POV	Green wash of the city passing by. Tall, empty buildings all Right in front of the LAV... A massive CRATER. The street's impassable.
M	SGT. NANTZ	We gotta go around. The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240 FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying
M	SGT. NANTZ	Get ready, Imlay. Here they come. Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Think I see our ride, sergeant!
M	SGT NANTZ	Get us there. Cause we're about to get lit up. The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200
M	SGT. NANTZ	See what that Bushmaster can do, Imlay! Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Come on, you martian bastards! The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind
M	PVT. IMLAY	Where'd they go? Where'd they go? Nantz is scanning the sky, then...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Imlay, on your six! Imlay spins in the turret, picking up...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Son of a... Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Getting close, Imlay...
M	PVT. IMLAY	I got it. Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit... It PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE
M	SGT. NANTZ	Stand on it, Stavrou! Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage...
M	PVT. IMLAY	The chopper! Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Last stop!
M	SGT. NANTZ	Everybody out! The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and
M	SGT. NANTZ	Pretty decent shooting, Imlay. Goddamn, you did it, sergeant! We're gonna get these people out! The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school
M	CREW CHIEF	You are in the middle of the shit, Sergeant! Everything's been pulled back.
M	SGT. NANTZ	What are you talking about?!
M	CREW CHIEF	We've lost most of our air assets. We're abandoning Los Angeles. This city's done...! Let's go! The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others. The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude.
M	SGT. NANTZ	What the hell happened?!
M	CREW CHIEF	Something there was playing hell with our power! Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him. Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Set us back down!
M	CREW CHIEF	What?! The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now. We need to recon that area!
M	CREW CHIEF	We can't land! May not have power to take off again... Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He
M	SGT. NANTZ	Then we'll rope down!
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	What the hell, sergeant? What's going on?
M	SGT. NANTZ	There's something over there... We could be the only ones left here to figure out what it is. Let's go, marines. The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull
M	SGT. NANTZ	NOW! Go! Go! The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as...
M	SGT. NANTZ	They'll get you safe. He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a
M	SGT. NANTZ	See you soon, buddy.
M	HECTOR	What are you gonna do?
M	SGT. NANTZ	We're gonna fight. Nantz turns, grabs a ROPE, drops out of the chopper. Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly,
M	PVT. KERNS	Why'd we get off the chopper, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	'Cause we have a job to do.
M	PVT. IMLAY	But we were getting out...!
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	You have some hunch and now we're stuck out here in the shit?!
M	SGT. NANTZ	That's right. This fight's not over.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Sergeant's gonna get us killed! Just like my brother. A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Believe me, Correggio, I grieved for every marine I ever lost... Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.
M	SGT. NANTZ	But we are in the fight of our lives right now. And our duty is to keep moving forward. Keep fighting. That's how we honor men like your brother, Correggio. And Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father, who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't trained for that. He just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done. If a civilian can do that... Well then I better square my shit away and do whatever I have to do to defeat this enemy. But I can't do it alone. Nantz stares. The tension is palpable.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I need you men. And maybe we'll die fighting today. Not because we're heroes. But because we're goddamn United States marines, and always will be. I'm willing to give my full measure for you. I'm hoping you'll do the same for me. A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE AS ONE.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell and back. Nantz smiles, nods.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Good. 'Cause that's where we're going. Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Laser target, sir?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Might have to get some cruise missiles in here.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Shit, yes, Sergeant. Hostiles. Twelve o'clock. Nantz looks up to see... ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got plenty of armor. Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Reverse, Corporal.
M	CPL. STAVROU	Aye, aye, Sergeant. As he BACKS UP, mowing back over the remaining aliens... The
M	SGT. NANTZ	What's going on?
M	CPL. STAVROU	Losing power, Sergeant. Gauges are dropping... losing voltage... The LAV slows. The engine skips. Then the LAV DIES.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Stavrou?
M	CPL. STAVROU	She's dead, Sergeant. Nantz looks around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted.
M	SGT. NANTZ	All right, dismount. Grab anything you think we can use. The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to...
M	PVT. IMLAY	Hot as hell here.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	No lights.
M	PVT. ADUKWU	My watch stopped.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Something's generating heat. Messing with our electronics. Sucking up all the power... Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Where would you put a critical asset if you wanted to protect it? Or hide it?
M	CPL. HARRIS	Underground. Nantz points to A SUBWAY ENTRANCE AHEAD.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch the street. Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Let's go. Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the You two stay here, watch our backs. Imlay, come with me. Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway. They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here. No. Save it. Something is killing anything electronic we use. Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see... A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO...
M	A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL	Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED. The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY. Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Run, Imlay! Run! BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air. Nantz follows Imlay UP THE STAIRS as... Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing... Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the
M	SGT. NANTZ	How many?
M	CPL. HARRIS	Hard to tell. A lot.
M	SGT. NANTZ	I think I got their attention. Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the
M	SGT. NANTZ	Look. There's something big down in the tunnels. It's sucking up a lot of power, could be a major Command &.Control asset. Nantz stares at his men. We need to destroy it.
M	PVT. KERNS	But we got no jets left, right, Sergeant?
M	SGT. NANTZ	Hopefully, they can still fire cruise missiles from Pendleton or Vandenburg... I'll radio in a strike, paint the target from the street. You know what that means. The man nod solemnly.
M	PVT. IMLAY	We gotta hold 'em off long enough to paint the target.
M	CPL. STAVROU	If we can get a transmission out before the radio dies...
M	CPL. HARRIS	And the targeting laser lasts long enough for command to get a lock on the target.
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Hell, dying's easy, ladies. Everything else takes balls, right? They all laugh softly.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Let's do it. He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS: Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November. Priority Fire Mission. I have identified a major enemy command and control asset-- located grid 459083. 1 WILL BE LASING.
M	COMMAND (V.0.)	Foxtrot 2. You have visual confirmation of this C&C; asset? We can't waste resources.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Affirmative. They're building a huge complex underground... I think it's the head of the snake. Repeat. I will be... Alien fire EXPLODES now, rocking the station. Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile. Here we go... Nantz switches on the TARGETING LASER. A RED BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the designator to a fixed Nantz looks up to see... The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Here they come! The marines FORM A PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Hold them back! We have to keep the laser on target! Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in... NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien... Knocking the laser away. Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as... Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up, An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Did we get a lock!?
M	SGT. NANTZ	I don't know! Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...
M	SGT. NANTZ	INCOMING! Fall back! This way! Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do, Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Think you just twisted your ankle,. sir. And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.
M	SGT. NANTZ	Don't stop!! We're too close to the impact point!! The marines start running as... THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall. The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center. They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE. HIS MEN. His warriors. Standing with smoking weapons, ready
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	You know what, Sergeant? My brother said you were a bad ass. I had no idea...
M	SGT. NANTZ	Your brother was one helluva marine, Correggio. So are you.
M	PVT. IMLAY	Man, it's quiet.
M	CHOPPER PILOT (V.0.)	They're in full retreat throughout Los Angeles, heading back into the ocean. Units are mopping up. On this, Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.
M	SGT. NANTZ	This has been a hell of a battle. Plenty of other battles to go. Everybody good with that? The marines don't hesitate.
M	MARINES	Yes, Sergeant!
M	CPL. CORREGGIO	Well, uh, actually, Sergeant... there's this girl I was supposed to meet up with tonight... I'm sure she'll understand. Nantz looks at his marines.
M	NANTZ	I think you men earned the right to call yourselves marines today. I'm damn proud of every one of you. Retreat!?
