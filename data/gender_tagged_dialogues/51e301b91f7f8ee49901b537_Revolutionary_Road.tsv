M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	FRANK	So, what do you do?
F	APRIL	I'm studying to be an actress. You?
M	FRANK	I'm a longshoreman.
F	APRIL	No, I mean really.
M	FRANK	I mean really too. Starting Monday, though, I'm doing something a little more glamorous. Night cashier at a cafeteria.
F	APRIL	I don't mean how you make money. I mean what are you interested in?
M	FRANK	Honey - if I had the answer to that one, I bet I'd bore us both to death in half an hour.
M	WOMAN	Thank God that's over...
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	...And she was very disappointing.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Frank! Very nice Frank!
M	FRANK	Thanks, Mrs. Givings.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. You have a very talented wife.
M	FRANK	I'll pass it along!
F	MILLY	Frank!
M	FRANK	Hi!
F	MILLY	She's through there...! You `bout ready for that drink?
M	FRANK	Couple of minutes!
M	FRANK	April, sweetheart. You were great. I mean it.
F	APRIL	Hi. You about ready to leave? I've just got to get this makeup off, then we can go.
M	FRANK	Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph or anything, was it?
F	APRIL	I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
M	FRANK	Take your time. Will you do me a favor? Milly and Shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards. Will you say we can't? Say it's because of the baby sitter or something?
M	FRANK	Well, the thing is, I already said that we could. I mean, I just saw them out there and I said we would.
F	APRIL	Oh. Then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? That should be simple enough.
M	FRANK	Don't you think that's a little bit rude, April?
F	APRIL	Well I'll tell them myself.
M	FRANK	Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll tell them.
M	FRANK	I mean it, baby. You were the only person in that play.
F	APRIL	Thank you.
M	FRANK	We just never should've let you get mixed up in the damned thing.
F	APRIL	All right.
M	FRANK	You've studied for Christ's sake.
F	APRIL	Could we sort of stop talking about it now?
M	FRANK	Sure. I just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all. Because it's not worth it. I mean, it's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people - what'd you say?
F	APRIL	I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	What are you doing? Why are we stopping?
F	APRIL	No, Frank, please don't...
M	FRANK	Baby, it's okay...
F	APRIL	Please don't touch me.
M	FRANK	April...
F	APRIL	Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME ALONE!
M	FRANK	It strikes me, that there's a considerable amount of bullshit going on here.... And there's one or two things I'd like to clear up. Number one, it's not my fault the play was lousy. Number two, it's sure as hell not my fault you didn't turn out to be an actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the better off we'll both be. Number three, I don't happen to fit the role of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you've been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved here. Number four -
M	FRANK	What the hell are you doing? Come back to the car.
F	APRIL	No. Just let me stand here a second.
M	FRANK	April?
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over Route Twelve?
F	APRIL	Haven't I made it clear I don't particularly want to talk about it?
M	FRANK	Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice about this thing.
F	APRIL	How kind of you. How terribly, terribly kind of you.
M	FRANK	Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.
F	APRIL	You're always so wonderfully definite, aren't you, on the subject of what you do and don't deserve?
M	FRANK	Wait a minute!
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Wait a minute, God damn it!
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	You listen to me. This is one time you're not going to get away with twisting everything I say.
F	APRIL	Christ, I wish you'd stayed home tonight!
M	FRANK	You know what you are when you're like this? You're sick. I really mean that. You're sick!
F	APRIL	And you know what you are? You're disgusting.
M	FRANK	Oh, yeah?
F	APRIL	Just because you've got me safely in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want!
M	FRANK	You in a trap! You in a trap! Jesus, don't make me laugh!
F	APRIL	Yes, me. Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic little boy ­­ Look at you! Look at you, and tell me how by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man!
M	FRANK	Don't look at me like that, April.
F	APRIL	Could we please go home now? I'm going to need your help this morning, Old Scout.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	For the next few hours, you're to warn me of Bandy's every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in the likely event I that I throw up. It's that bad.
M	FRANK	Good morning, Jack.
M	JACK	Nothing good about it, I assure you.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Of course, I knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... A small remodeled barn, or a carriage house ­ And I just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... But I don't want you to despair. There is one place down here I want to show you... Now of course it isn't very desirable at this end. As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these little cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places ­ plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort.
M	MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)	But eventually... Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary Road, which is much nicer. Now, the place I want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It's right around this next curve... Now, you'll see it ­ there.
M	MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)	See the little white one? Sweet isn't it? The perky way it sits there on its little slope? Charming, isn't it?
F	APRIL	Oh, yes.
M	FRANK	You wanted to see me?
M	BANDY	Came for you from Toledo this morning.
M	BANDY (CONT'D)	This is the third one this month.
M	FRANK	Oh, right, sorry. I thought I'd taken care of that...
M	BANDY	I'm not prepared to have this conversation again, Frank. You understand?
M	FRANK	...Absolutely, yes.
M	BANDY	These folks in the provinces look up to us, Frank. We need to be efficient. We can't have this kind of back and forth, and so forth. It's just not efficient. Am I right?
M	FRANK	...Absolutely, yes, yes...
M	JACK	What was that about?
M	FRANK	Toledo. Branch manager wants a revised brochure for the conference on "The Knox 500." "It's just not efficient."
M	JACK	Sounds like a real goodie.
M	FRANK	I don't even know what the Knox 500 does... Do you?
M	JACK	Don't insult me.
M	FRANK	Now, if you'll look in the inactive file under SP-1109 you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency... and that way we can trace the thing back to its original sources.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	I hope you weren't planning on an early lunch.
F	MAUREEN	I'm not really hungry.
M	FRANK	Good. I'll check on you later.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	You know something? You're lucky you met me.
F	MAUREEN	Oh? How's that?
M	FRANK	I can show you the ropes. There's an art to survival at Knox. Let me show you what I mean.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Bring me the telephone would you? And two more martinis.
F	MAUREEN	Wow.
M	FRANK	Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank Wheeler here. Just wanted to let you know that I've had to send Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides for me. I'll probably need her the rest of the day... Okay? Fine. You too.
F	MAUREEN	I never even heard of Visual Aides.
M	FRANK	That's because it doesn't exist.
M	MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)	Yoo-hoo!
F	APRIL	Hi Helen.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	I can't stay a minute... My, don't you look comfy! I just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in the front yard. All it wants is just a tiny dollop of water for the first few days, and you'll find it absolutely thrives.
F	APRIL	Well, thank you... You want some coffee?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Only if you're having some.
F	APRIL	Is there something I can do for you, Helen?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do have a small favor I'd like to ask... It's about my son, John. He's been in the hospital.
F	APRIL	I'm sorry to hear that.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Well, actually, just for the present, he's in Pleasant Brook... Psychiatric.
F	APRIL	...I'm so sorry.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh... Nothing serious. He just got a little run down. Things can just get the better of us sometimes. Don't you think?
F	APRIL	Yes. Of course.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	It really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders... Anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good.
M	MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)	I think he finds my friends a little conventional, frankly. I mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD in mathematics. I suppose you could say he's an intellectual. It would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you.
F	APRIL	We'd love to Helen.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	So, I thought perhaps if you had some time...
F	APRIL	We'd love to.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Thank you, dear... Thank you.
M	MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)	I remember when you first came off the train. You weren't like most of my clients. You were different, somehow. Well, you looked simply ravishing and I just knew Frank did something terribly brilliant in town. You just seemed... special... Of course you still are.
M	MAUREEN (O.S.)	I guess you got me a little drunk.
M	FRANK	You know what today is?
F	MAUREEN	...Monday?
M	FRANK	It's my birthday. I'm thirty years old today.
F	MAUREEN	Happy birthday! What was the name of the department you made up again?
M	FRANK	Visual Aides.
F	MAUREEN	...What-a-joke.
M	FRANK	Want to hear a real joke...?
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	My old man worked at Knox.
F	MAUREEN	Yeah?
M	FRANK	He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once a year he used to take me into the city for lunch. It was supposed to be a special, life-advice sort of occasion.
F	MAUREEN	Nice.
M	FRANK	Not really... I used to sit there and think, `I hope to Christ I don't end up like you.'
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	And here I am, a thirty year old Knox man. Can you beat that?
F	MAUREEN	I think I kind of lost you... Your father worked for Knox...?
M	MAUREEN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, but everything's kinda going out of focus.
M	FRANK	How `bout some air?
M	FRANK	You ever been to Paris?
F	APRIL	I've never really been anywhere.
M	FRANK	Maybe I'll take you with me.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	I'm going back first chance I get. People are alive there. All I know now is that I want to feel things. Really feel them. How's that for an ambition...?
F	APRIL	Frank Wheeler?
M	FRANK	Mm?
F	APRIL	I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	I mean it.
M	FRANK	Well, I guess this wasn't what you had in mind when you went to work this morning?
F	MAUREEN	No. It certainly wasn't.
M	MAUREEN (CONT'D)	Do you have a cigarette, Frank?
M	FRANK	Sure, here.
F	MAUREEN	Can I get you a drink or anything?
M	FRANK	No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I guess I'd better be cutting out, it's getting kind of late.
F	MAUREEN	Gee, that's right. Have you missed your train?
M	FRANK	It's all right, I'll get the next one. Listen: you were swell. Take care now.
F	APRIL	Frank...
M	FRANK	Why are you all dressed up?
F	APRIL	First of all, I missed you all day and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been since that stupid play. I'm sorry for everything and... And I love you... Now wait here till I call you. Okay?
M	APRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Alright Frank! You can come in now!
F	APRIL	Frank. I have had the most wonderful idea. I've been thinking about it all day.
M	FRANK	What's all this about?
F	APRIL	You know how much money we have saved...? Enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime. And with the money we could get from the house and the car, longer than that.
M	FRANK	What we get for the house...What are you talking about? Where are we going to live?
F	APRIL	...Paris.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	You always said it was the only place you'd ever been that was worth living. So why don't we go there?
M	FRANK	You're serious?
F	APRIL	Yes. What's stopping us?
M	FRANK	What's stopping us? Well, I can think of a lot of things. For instance, what kind of a job could I possibly get?
F	APRIL	You won't be getting any kind of job, because I will.
M	FRANK	Oh, right.
F	APRIL	Don't laugh -- listen a minute! Have you any idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies in Europe? Embassies and those things.
M	FRANK	No, I don't.
F	APRIL	I'm serious about this Frank. Do you think I'm kidding or something?
M	FRANK	No, I know, I know. I just have a couple of questions, is all. For one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly I'm supposed to be doing while you're out earning all this money?
F	APRIL	Don't you see that's the whole idea? You'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. You'll have time, Frank. You'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it.
M	FRANK	Sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all.
F	APRIL	Well, I happen to think this is unrealistic. I think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	You want to know the worst part? Our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I've realized...? We're not! We're just like everyone else. Look at us! We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we've been punishing each other for it.
M	FRANK	Listen: we decided to move out here. No one ever forced me to take the job at Knox.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	I mean who ever said I was supposed to be a big deal, anyway?
F	APRIL	When I first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be.
M	FRANK	I was a little wise guy with a big mouth, that's all.
F	APRIL	You were not! How can you even say that?
M	FRANK	...All right... So, I'll have time. And God knows that's appealing. It's very appealing. And I mean, everything you say might make a certain amount of sense, if I had some definite talent maybe. If I were an artist or a writer.
F	APRIL	But Frank, listen to me: It's what you are that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.
M	FRANK	And what's that?
F	APRIL	Don't you know...?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	You're the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world... You're a man.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	This is our chance, Frank. This is our one chance.
M	FRANK	Okay.
F	APRIL	Okay?
M	FRANK	Why not...? Why the hell not?
M	JACK	Ah, Franklin. Good to see your shining face. What's the news?
M	FRANK	I'm moving to Paris.
M	JACK	Right. And I'm moving to Tangiers.
M	FRANK	...Intra-company letter to Toledo... Attention B.F. Chalmers, branch manager... With regard to recent and repeated correspondence, this is to advise that the matter has been... very satisfactorily taken in hand, period, paragraph.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	We wholly agree that the existing brochure is unsuitable. To this end we have developed...
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	"Speaking of Production Control..."
M	CLERK (O.S.)	Here you are Mrs. Wheeler:
M	CLERK (CONT'D)	Here's the travellers checks you asked for... and your steamer reservations... and these I'll pass on to the embassy for you.
F	APRIL	Thank you.
M	CLERK	Good luck.
M	JACK	And when does this noble experiment commence?
M	FRANK	September. October at the outside.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	I just happen to think people are better off doing some kind of work they actually like.
M	ED	Right, yes.
M	VINCE	Absolutely, absolutely.
M	JACK	But... I mean, assuming there is a true vocation waiting for you. Wouldn't you be just as likely to discover it here as there?
M	FRANK	No... I don't think it's possible to discover anything on the fifteenth floor of the Knox building, and I don't think any of you do either.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	This one's on me.
F	APRIL	...All the way to... here.
F	JENNIFER	But why?
F	APRIL	Well, sweetheart. It's a big world out there and we thought maybe we should go see a little bit of it.
M	MICHAEL	How far is it?
F	APRIL	A long way. We have to take a boat ride over the sea to get there.
F	JENNIFER	I won't know anyone there.
F	APRIL	I know. And neither will I. But remember when you started school? And now look how many friends you have...
M	FRANK	You'll never guess what they eat in Paris. You'll never guess...
F	JENNIFER	What?
M	FRANK	Snails.
M	JENNIFER/MICHAEL	Snails?!
F	APRIL	And frog's legs!
M	SHEP	Buddappa banh! Banh! Banh!
F	MILLY	You better get changed, they'll be here soon.
M	SHEP	That what you're wearing?
F	MILLY	Don't you like it?
M	SHEP	...No... No. You look great, doll. Guess I better haul ass.
M	SHEP	Hiya gang.
M	MILLY (O.S.)	Shep?
F	APRIL	Oh those look great. I'm starving!
F	MILLY	April, I can't get over it - you look like the cat who ate the canary! Do you have something to tell us? A little bit of news?
M	SHEP	Not to pry or anything.
F	MILLY	I'm not prying. Am I prying? I didn't mean to.
M	FRANK	Actually, we have got some pretty important news.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	You want to tell `em?
F	APRIL	We're going to Europe. To Paris... To live.
F	MILLY	What?
M	SHEP	When?
F	MILLY	Why?
M	FRANK	September.
F	MILLY	But what for?
M	FRANK	What for? Because we've always wanted to. Because the kids are still young. Because it's beautiful. Shep, you tell her.
M	SHEP	...It's a great city.
F	MILLY	When did you make this decision?
F	APRIL	Oh... about a week ago... its hard to remember. We just suddenly decided to go, that's all.
F	MILLY	About a week ago, and you tell us now!
F	APRIL	We had to get used to the idea.
M	SHEP	So, what's the deal, Frank? You get a job over there, or what?
M	FRANK	No. Not exactly.
M	SHEP	What do you mean, `not exactly?'
F	APRIL	Frank won't be doing any kind of a job, because I will.
M	SHEP	And what are you going to do?
M	FRANK	I'm going to study... and I'm going to read and... I suppose I'm going to finally figure out what I want to do with my life.
M	SHEP	...While she supports you?
M	FRANK	Yes. While she supports me... At least in the beginning.
F	APRIL	You wouldn't believe what they pay for secretarial work in government agencies over there. NATO and E.C.A. and those places.
M	FRANK	The cost of living is dirt cheap compared to here, so we should be all right. The truth is we just need something different.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	We're not getting any younger and we don't want life to just pass us by.
F	MILLY	Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I mean it; it really sounds wonderful. We'll certainly miss you, though - won't we, sweetie? Golly.
M	SHEP	Sure.
F	MILLY	Paris. Wow.
M	SHEP	You know what I think?
M	SHEP (CONT'D)	I think this whole plan sounds a little immature.
F	MILLY	Oh God, I'm so relieved. Me too... I was thinking that the whole time.
M	SHEP	What kind of man is going to sit around in his bathrobe picking his nose while his wife works all day?
F	MILLY	I don't know, Shep. I just don't know.
M	SHEP	What is it?
F	MILLY	Nothing. I'm just so relieved.
M	SHEP	Come on. Don't cry. Please. It's all right. It's going to be all right.
M	SHEP (CONT'D)	I'll go.
M	FRANK	Jesus, their faces! You'd think we'd told them that we were swimming up the Yangtzee river or something.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	You know what this is like, April? Talking like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way? It's like the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I was probably just as scared as everyone else, but inside I never felt better. I felt alive. I felt full of blood. And everything looked more real. The guys in their uniforms. The snow on the fields, the trees. And all of us just... walking. I mean I was scared of course. But I kept thinking: this is it. This is the truth.
F	APRIL	I felt that way once too.
M	FRANK	When?
F	APRIL	The first time you made love to me.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	...No
M	FRANK	What's up?
M	ED	Bart Pollock is here.
M	VINCE	He's in Bandy's office.
M	FRANK	Yeah?
M	ED	Looks like he wants to talk to you.
M	JACK	Hey. Keep my name out of it.
M	BANDY	Frank. How are you? You know Bart Pollock?
M	FRANK	Well, we've never met, but -
M	BART POLLOCK	Glad to know you Frank.
M	BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)	Speaking of production control?
M	BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)	Frank... This is a crackerjack. They're just tickled to death in Toledo.
M	FRANK	You wouldn't have believed this guy.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	He's perfect Presidential material in the worst sense. A million dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle between his ears. "Frank, this is a crackerjack."
F	APRIL	Wish I saw his face when you told him you were leaving.
M	FRANK	...Horse's ass.
F	APRIL	I think this is them.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Sorry to be late.
F	APRIL	You're not late.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	The traffic was terrible.
F	MR. GIVINGS	Good to see you.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Wasn't it terrible, Howard?
F	MR. GIVINGS	Route 12.
F	APRIL	You didn't have to do that.
M	FRANK	The time they finish that stretch of road, they'll have to start all over again.
F	APRIL	And you must be John?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Say hello, John.
M	JOHN	Nice to meetcha. Heard a lot aboutcha.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Where are your darling children?
F	APRIL	They're at a birthday party. Sorry they couldn't be here.
M	JOHN	Don't worry. If I had a certified lunatic coming around the house, I'd probably get the kids out of the way too.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh, look at all this food! You didn't have to go to any trouble for us.
F	APRIL	It's just some sandwiches.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	John, would you like a sandwich?
M	JOHN	Helen's been talking it up about you people for months.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	The nice young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, the nice young Revolutionaries on Wheeler road.
M	FRANK	Who'd like some sherry?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Please, don't bother Frank.
M	JOHN	I'd like some sherry. And I'll drink Helen's if she doesn't beat me to it. But, hey... Listen, though. You got a high-ball glass...? Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim. That's the way I like it.
M	FRANK	I think I can do that.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it.
M	JOHN	You a lawyer Frank?
M	FRANK	No, I'm not.
M	JOHN	I could use a lawyer.
F	MR. GIVINGS	John, let's not get started again about the lawyer.
M	JOHN	Pop, couldn't you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	See, I've got a good many questions to ask and I'm willing to pay for the answers... Now, I don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window. If he hits her with it and kills her, that's a criminal case.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
M	JOHN	If all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Maybe we'll see a rainbow! John, come have a look.
M	JOHN	Ma, how about doing everybody a favor? How about shutting up!
F	MR. GIVINGS	Steady down, now.
M	FRANK	I can look into it. Maybe recommend someone.
M	JOHN	So, what do you do, Frank?
M	FRANK	I work for Knox Business Machines.
M	JOHN	You design the machines?
M	FRANK	Nope.
M	JOHN	Make `em, sell `em, repair `em?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	All these questions.
M	FRANK	I sort of help sell them, I guess. I work in the office. Actually, it's sort of a stupid job. I mean there's nothing ­ you know, interesting about it or anything.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh, Frank...
M	JOHN	Whaddya do it for then?
F	MR. GIVINGS	Maybe Frank doesn't want to be questioned like this, son.
M	JOHN	Okay, okay, okay ­ I know it's none of my business. And besides, I know the answer. You want to play house, you got to have a job. You want to play very nice house, very sweet house, then you got to have a job you don't like. Anyone comes along and asks "Whaddya do it for?' he's probably on a four-hour pass from the State funny farm. All agreed...? Ma?
F	MR. GIVINGS	Sorry, Frank.
M	FRANK	Don't be. I agree with everything you said, John. We both do. That's why I'm quitting the job in the fall and we're taking off.
F	APRIL	We're moving to Paris.
M	JOHN	Did you know about this, Ma...? Wow. How do you feel about that, Ma? The nice young Wheelers are taking off!
F	MRS. GIVINGS	...John, please.
F	MR. GIVINGS	Steady down, son.
M	FRANK	How about some fresh air, John?
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	If that's all right with you?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	I don't know if it's a good idea.
F	MR. GIVINGS	...If John wants to, I don't see the harm.
F	APRIL	I hear you're a mathematician.
M	JOHN	You hear wrong. It's all gone now.
F	APRIL	All gone?
M	JOHN	You know what electrical shock treatments are?
F	APRIL	Yes. Yes I do.
M	JOHN	I've had thirty-seven.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	See?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional Problems.' Just jolted out the mathematics.
F	APRIL	How awful.
M	JOHN	`How awful...' Why, because mathematics is so `interesting?'
F	APRIL	No. Because the shocks must be awful and... well, because it's awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do. I think mathematics are dull.
M	JOHN	I like your girl, Frank.
M	FRANK	Me too.
M	JOHN	So, what do a couple of people like you have to run away from?
M	FRANK	We're not running.
M	JOHN	And what's in Paris?
F	APRIL	A different way of life.
M	FRANK	So maybe we are running... We're running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here.
M	JOHN	The hopeless emptiness? Now, you've said it. Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness... Wow.
F	APRIL	You know, he's the first person who seemed to know what we were talking about.
M	FRANK	That's true. Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.
F	APRIL	If being crazy means living life as if it matters then I don't care if we are completely insane. Do you?
M	FRANK	No.
F	APRIL	I love you so much.
M	BART POLLOCK	Tell you something, Frank. I'm a little sore at Bandy for the way he's kept you under a bushel all these years. This place okay, for you?
M	FRANK	This is just fine, sir. Fine.
M	BART POLLOCK	One thing interests me, Frank, and one thing only: selling the electronic computer to the American businessman...
M	BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)	That's why I'm assembling a team. Men like you, not your average salesmen... It'll mean more money, and I got to be honest, maybe more of a time commitment. But you'll be part of something exciting, Wheeler... Computers.
M	FRANK	Well, sir, it sounds exciting.
M	BART POLLOCK	Bart!
M	FRANK	Bart...
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Do you happen to remember an Earl Wheeler?
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Out of Yonkers?
M	BART POLLOCK	Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
M	FRANK	My father. He worked at Knox almost twenty years.
M	BART POLLOCK	Earl Wheeler... Earl Wheeler...
M	FRANK	No reason you would have heard of him.
M	BART POLLOCK	Well, I'm sure he was a good man.
M	FRANK	There's something I should have mentioned earlier... I'm leaving the firm. In the fall.
M	BART POLLOCK	Another outfit?
M	FRANK	No, it's not another outfit --
M	BART POLLOCK	Now look, Frank. Is it a question of money? Because if it is, there's no reason we can't get together on a satisfactory ­
M	FRANK	I appreciate that, but it's not money. It's more of a personal thing.
M	BART POLLOCK	A personal thing? I see. Frank... Let me tell you something my father told me... A man only gets a couple chances in life. If he doesn't grab `em by the balls, it won't be long before he finds himself sitting around wondering how he got to be second rate.
M	FRANK	I guess so.
M	BART POLLOCK	So, do me a favor... Sleep on it. Discuss it with your wife. Because let's face it: where the hell would any of us be without our wives, anyway?
M	BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)	And Frank, in all sincerity, if you do decide to join us, I believe it'll be a thing you'll never regret.
M	BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)	And I believe something else, too. I believe it'd be a fine memorial to your Dad.
M	FRANK	Knowing what you've got, comma, knowing what you need, comma, Knowing what you can do without, dash. That's inventory control.
F	MAUREEN	Oh, hi Frank. Working late?
M	FRANK	I got to dig myself out here.
F	MAUREEN	I heard you were getting promoted.
M	MAUREEN (CONT'D)	Big shot. I guess your Dad would have been real proud, huh?
M	FRANK	Huh. Yeah, I guess so...
F	MAUREEN	So...
M	MAUREEN (CONT'D)	maybe I should buy you a drink or something? You know...? Celebrate.
M	FRANK	Yeah. Maybe.
F	MAUREEN	I'll just get my coat.
F	JENNIFER	I'm going to take my doll carriage and my bear and my three Easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and my doll house.
F	APRIL	I thought maybe we'd give the doll house to Madeline.
F	JENNIFER	No! I don't want to give it to Madeline.
F	APRIL	I already explained to you, the big things are going to be hard to pack.
F	JENNIFER	But Madeline can have my bear and my Easter rabbits -
F	APRIL	No! Just the big things. Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside and play with Michael.
F	JENNIFER	I don't feel like it.
F	APRIL	You've been inside all day.
F	JENNIFER	I don't feel like it!
F	APRIL	Well, I don't feel like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody who's too bored and silly to listen!
M	FRANK	What's the matter?
F	APRIL	Nothing.
M	FRANK	I don't believe you. Did something happen today or what?
F	APRIL	Nothing happened today that I haven't known about for days and days.
M	FRANK	What?
F	APRIL	Oh God, Frank, please don't look so dense. Do you mean you haven't guessed or anything?
M	FRANK	What are you talking about?
F	APRIL	I'm pregnant, that's all.
M	FRANK	What...? Jesus.
F	APRIL	Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until dinner to tell you, but I just - well, I've been pretty sure all week and today I went to the Doctor and now I can't even pretend it's not true.
M	FRANK	Jesus... How long?
F	APRIL	Ten weeks.
M	FRANK	You didn't say anything.
F	APRIL	I thought... Oh, I don't know what I thought.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
M	FRANK	I know you are.
F	APRIL	We don't have to let this stop us. There are things we can do. Remember that girl at school I told you about...? As long as you do it before 12 weeks, it's fine.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	We've got to be together in this, Frank. Otherwise nothing's going to make any sense.
M	FRANK	Okay. We'll figure it out.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	12 weeks. So we have time.
F	APRIL	I love you Frank.
M	FRANK	...I love you too.
M	SHEP	So, Frank, how's work? They gonna survive without you?
M	FRANK	Actually... Something kinda funny happened the other day. I did some dumb little piece of work to get myself off the hook with Bandy, and suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.
M	SHEP	That's always the way, isn't it?
M	FRANK	It's incredible. I knocked this thing off in a couple of minutes and now they want me to join their team of `specialist' salesmen.
M	SHEP	Morons.
M	FRANK	It'd be funny, if they weren't talking about so much damn money.
M	SHEP	So, you tempted?
M	FRANK	Well, it's kind of ironic, don't you think?
M	SHEP	She okay?
F	APRIL	I thought you turned the job down?
M	FRANK	Not yet... It's just an option, that's all. With the money they're talking, things could be different for us here. We could get a better place. Travel.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Look, the point is - we could be happy here. At least for a while. It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April.
F	APRIL	So you've made up your mind?
M	FRANK	No. Like I said, it's an option.
F	APRIL	...And supposing you're right. You make all this money and we have this interesting life here. Won't you still be wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous? Just like your father.
M	FRANK	Maybe we let that be my business.
F	APRIL	Your business?
M	FRANK	It's too hot for this. I'm going to get wet.
F	APRIL	You don't want to go, do you?
M	FRANK	Come on, April. Of course I do.
F	APRIL	You don't! Because you've never tried at anything. And if you don't try at anything you can't fail.
M	FRANK	What the hell do you mean I don't try? I support you, don't I? I pay for this house. I work ten hours a day at a job I can't stand.
F	APRIL	You don't have to!
M	FRANK	Bullshit! I'm not happy about it. But I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Where are you going?
M	FRANK	Is it alright with you if I go to the bathroom?
M	FRANK	What the hell are you going to do with this?
F	APRIL	And what do you think you're going to do? You're going to stop me?
M	FRANK	You're damn right!
F	APRIL	Go ahead and try!
M	FRANK	Listen. Listen to me. You do this - you do this and I swear to God I'll -
F	APRIL	You'll what? You'll leave me? Is that a threat, or a promise?
M	FRANK	When did you buy this, April? I want to know!
F	APRIL	You know you really are being melodramatic about the whole thing. As long as it's done in the first twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.
M	FRANK	That's now April! Don't I get a say?
F	APRIL	Of course you do! It would be for you, Frank, don't you see? So you can have time. Like we talked about.
M	FRANK	How can it be for me if the thought makes my stomach turn over?
F	APRIL	Then it's for me... Tell me we can have the baby in Paris, Frank. But don't make me stay here. Please.
M	FRANK	We can't have the baby in Paris.
F	APRIL	Why not? I don't need everything we have here. I don't care where we live! I mean who made these rules, anyway? The only reason we moved out here was because I got pregnant. Then we had another child to prove the first one wasn't a mistake. I mean how long does it go on?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Frank. Do you actually want another child? Well, do you?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Come on, tell me. Tell me the truth, Frank. Remember that? We used to live by it. You know what's so good about the truth? Everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it. No one forgets the truth, Frank, they just get better at lying. So tell me: do you really want another child?
M	FRANK	All I know is what I feel. And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way.
F	APRIL	But I've had two children. Doesn't that count in my favor?
M	FRANK	Christ! The fact that you even put it that way! You make it sound like having children is a punishment.
F	APRIL	I love my children.
M	FRANK	And you're sure about that? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
M	FRANK	April, you just said our daughter was mistake. How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her, or Michael for that matter? How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet?
F	APRIL	No that's not true. Of course I didn't.
M	FRANK	But how do I know April?
F	APRIL	Stop. Please just stop, Frank.
M	FRANK	April, a normal woman, a normal sane mother doesn't buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can, go live out some God damn fantasy.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	All I'm saying is you don't seem entirely rational about this thing... And maybe we should get someone to help you think about it.
F	APRIL	...And the new job's going to pay for that too?
M	FRANK	April if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for. Obviously.
F	APRIL	...Okay. I guess there isn't much more to say, then, is there?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea, huh?
M	FRANK	I guess maybe it was.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	We can be happy here April... I can make you happy here.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	We've had a great few months. It doesn't have to end...
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	We're going to be okay.
F	APRIL	I hope so Frank. I really hope so.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Thank you for waiting. Mr. Pollock can see you now.
M	JACK (O.S)	Foiled by faulty contraception.
M	ED	I can't say I'm sorry.
M	VINCE	Wouldn't have been the same without you.
M	JACK	You'd have been sorely missed in the old cubicle, I can tell you that. Besides which...
M	FRANK	What?
M	JACK	...Well, the plan always seemed a touch unrealistic, don't you think? I suppose, it's none of my business, really.
M	FRANK	No. I suppose it isn't.
M	JACK	Well, we won't be the only ones glad to hear the news. They'll be celebrating in the secretarial pool.
F	MILLY	Hey! Remember the first time you brought us here? You said, it takes a special kind of taste to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin!
M	SHEP	It's so awful it's kinda nice!
F	MILLY	That's right!
M	MILLY (CONT'D)	Look at me...! I'm just so happy. Our little gang's back together again!
M	SHEP	At least Europe's not going anywhere.
M	FRANK	Wanna dance?
F	APRIL	I don't really feel like it.
F	MILLY	I'll dance!
M	MILLY (CONT'D)	Guess April's pretty blue `bout Paris, huh?
M	FRANK	Think she'll be okay?
F	MILLY	Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple of days and we can get over anything! ...Frank.
M	MILLY (CONT'D)	Frank... I...
M	FRANK	You okay?
F	MILLY	Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very...
M	SHEP	Of all the inconsiderate...
F	APRIL	Look - why don't you take Milly home, then go home yourself and that would take care of both sitters. Then Shep can take me home later.
M	SHEP	All right with me.
M	FRANK	You'll be alright?
F	APRIL	Sure.
M	SHEP	I'm sorry you're not going away anymore. I know it was important to you. Don't take this wrong; I've been there and...they don't have so much we don't have here.
F	APRIL	It didn't have to be Paris.
M	SHEP	You just wanted out, huh?
F	APRIL	I wanted in. I just wanted us to live again.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	For years I thought we shared a secret...that we would be wonderful in the world. I didn't exactly know how, but just the possibility...kept me hoping.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	How pathetic is that? To put all your hopes in a promise that was never made? See, Frank knows...he knows what he wants. He's found his place. He's just fine. Married, two kids. It should be enough. It is for him. He's right; we were never special or destined or anything at all.
M	SHEP	Sure you are. You're The Wheelers. You're a terrific couple, everyone says so.
F	APRIL	I saw a different life. I can't stop seeing it. Can't leave, can't stay. No damn use to anyone.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Come on, let's do it.
M	SHEP	Let me take you somewhere.
F	APRIL	No. Please. Here. Now. In the back seat. April... This is what I've always wanted... I love you.
F	APRIL	Don't say that.
M	SHEP	I mean it, I love you.
F	APRIL	Please, just be quiet for a minute, then you can take me home.
M	FRANK	It's beautiful out.
F	APRIL	Yes; it's lovely.
M	FRANK	You know what today is?
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	It's twelve weeks.
F	APRIL	That's right.
M	FRANK	Look, this has been kind of a crazy summer. We've both been under a strain. I mean I know you're upset.
F	APRIL	You know I'm not sleeping with you and you want to know why?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't really feel like talking about it.
M	FRANK	Okay. What do you feel like talking about?
F	APRIL	Would it be all right if we didn't talk about anything? Can't we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time?
M	FRANK	I don't think I suggested we talk about everything all the time. My point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	I mean God knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately... I mean, as it happens... there is actually something I'd like to tell you about...
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	I've been with a girl in the city a few times. A girl I hardly even know. It was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away. She's just a kid... Anyway, it's over now. It's really over. If I weren't sure of that I guess I could never have told you about it.
F	APRIL	Why did you?
M	FRANK	Baby, I don't know. I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. Some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.
F	APRIL	No. I don't mean why did you have the girl; I mean why did you tell me about it?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	I mean what's the point? Is it supposed to make me jealous, or something? Is it supposed to make me fall in love with you, or back into bed with you, or what? I mean what am I supposed to say?
M	FRANK	Why don't you say what you feel?
F	APRIL	I don't feel anything.
M	FRANK	In other words you don't care what I do or who I fuck or anything? No; I guess that's right; I don't.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Fuck who you like.
M	FRANK	Don't you see...Don't you see, I want you to care.
F	APRIL	Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I would if I loved you. But you see I don't think I do anymore. And I only just figured that out. And that's why I'd just as soon not do any talking right now.
M	FRANK	Oh, now don't give me this shit! You know God damn well you love me!
F	APRIL	You think so?!
M	FRANK	You know GOD DAMN WELL!
M	MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)	Yoo-hoo! Any one home?
F	APRIL	I'm sorry dinner's late. Can I get anyone a refill?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to sit for a bit and socialize...You really didn't need to go through all the trouble of cooking. I can see you have a lot to do with packing and what not.
M	FRANK	Actually, there's been a change of plans.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh?
M	FRANK	I thought maybe it was obvious... April's pregnant.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh, April! I can't tell you how pleased I am. Oh, but I expect you'll be needing a bigger house, now, won't you?
M	JOHN	Hold it a second, Ma. I don't get this.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	What's so obvious about it? I mean okay, she's pregnant; so what? Don't people have babies in Europe?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	Oh John, really. I don't think we need to --
M	JOHN	I'm asking the man a question. If he doesn't want to give me the answer, I'm assuming he'll have sense enough to tell me so.
M	FRANK	Suppose we just say that people anywhere aren't very well advised to have babies unless they can afford them.
M	JOHN	Okay. Okay; it's a question of money. Money's always a good reason...
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	But it's hardly ever the real reason. What's the real reason? Wife talk you out of it, or what?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Little woman decide she isn't quite ready to quit playing house?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Nah, nah, that's not it. I can tell. She looks too tough. Tough and female and adequate as hell. Okay, then; it must've been you.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	What happened?
F	MRS. GIVINGS	John, please, you're being very --
M	JOHN	What happened, Frank? You get cold feet, or what? You decide you're better off here after all? You figure it's more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or --
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Wow, that did it! Look at his face! What's the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm?
M	MR. GIVINGS (CONT'D)	All right, son. I think we'd better be --
M	JOHN	Boy!
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Boy! You know something? I wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. That way you never have to find out what he's made of.
M	FRANK	Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you. I mean, who the hell do you think you are? You come in here and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head and I think it's about time someone told you to keep your God damn -
F	MRS. GIVINGS	He's not well, Frank.
M	FRANK	Not well, my ass! I don't give a damn if he's sick or well or dead or alive, he should keep his fucking opinions in the fucking insane asylum where they belong!
F	MR. GIVINGS	Let's go, son.
M	JOHN	Big man you got there, April.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Big family man, solid citizen. I feel sorry for you. Still, maybe you deserve each other.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Matter of fact, the way you look right now, I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls.
M	FRANK	You... fucking..!
F	MRS. GIVINGS	He's not well, Frank!
F	MR. GIVINGS	All right, John. Let's get on out to the car now.
F	MRS. GIVINGS	I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...
M	JOHN	Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry! Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry' enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I'm just about the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I? Hey, but I'm glad about one thing, though.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	You know what I'm glad about? I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.
M	FRANK	Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't tell me; let me guess. I made a Disgusting Spectacle of Myself. Right?
F	APRIL	Right.
M	FRANK	And everything that man said is True. Right? Isn't that what you're going to say?
F	APRIL	Apparently I don't have to. You're saying it for me.
M	FRANK	But you're wrong.
F	APRIL	Why am I wrong?
M	FRANK	Because the man is insane. He's fucking insane! Do you know what the definition of insanity is?
F	APRIL	What is it, Frank?
M	FRANK	The inability to relate to another human being. It's the inability to love.
F	APRIL	The in -- the in; the inabil; the inability to --
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a wonderful talker! If black could be made into white by talking, you'd be the man for the job. So now I'm crazy because I don't love you -- right? Is that the point?
M	FRANK	No. Wrong. You're not crazy and you do love me; that's the point.
F	APRIL	But I don't. In fact I loathe the sight of you. You're just a boy who made me laugh at a party once and if you come any closer, if you touch me or anything I think I'll scream.
M	FRANK	Oh baby listen --
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Fuck you, April. And fuck all your hateful, snotty little - What're you going to do now? Are you going to hit me? To show how much you love me?
M	FRANK	Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be bothered! You're not worth the trouble it'd take to hit you. You're not worth the powder it'd take to blow you up. You're an empty --
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	You're an empty, hollow fucking shell of a woman. What the hell are you living in my house for if you hate me so much? Huh? Will you answer me that? Why the hell do you fuck me? What the hell are you carrying my child for?
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Why the hell didn't you just get rid of it, when you had the chance? Because listen. Listen: I got news for you. I wish to God you had.
F	APRIL	Don't come any closer.
M	FRANK	April, listen, I --
F	APRIL	Don't come any closer. Can't I even get away from you in the fucking woods?
M	FRANK	April, listen, I didn't mean that. Honestly; I didn't mean what I said.
F	APRIL	Are you still talking? Isn't there any way to stop your talking? I NEED to think. Can't you see that?
M	FRANK	Please come back. What're you doing out here?
F	APRIL	Do you want me to scream again, Frank? Because I will, if you say another word! I mean it!
F	APRIL	Good morning.
M	FRANK	Good morning.
F	APRIL	Would you like scrambled eggs or fried?
M	FRANK	Oh. It doesn't really matter - Uh... scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.
F	APRIL	Fine. I'll have scrambled too.
M	FRANK	It's kinda nice having breakfast without the kids for a change.
F	APRIL	Yes. I thought you'd probably want a good breakfast today. I mean it's kind of an important day for you, isn't it? Isn't this the day you have your conference with Pollock?
M	FRANK	Yes. That's right, yes.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Big deal.
F	APRIL	I imagine it is a pretty big deal; for them, anyway. What exactly do you think you'll be doing? You never have told me much about it.
M	FRANK	Haven't I? Well... I think this whole thing is about Knox getting ready to buy up one of these really big computers, bigger than the `500'. Did I tell you about that?
F	APRIL	No, I don't believe you did. Well, you know -- Basically it's just a...a big, fast adding machine. Only...
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Instead of mechanical parts, you see, it's got thousands of little individual vacuum tubes.
F	APRIL	Oh, I see. At least I think I see; yes. It's really sort of -- interesting, isn't it?
M	FRANK	Well, I don't know, it's -- yeah, I guess it is sort of interesting, in a way.
F	APRIL	You should value what you do Frank. You're obviously good at it.
M	FRANK	Guess I'd better be getting started.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	Listen, though, April; this was really nice... I mean it was a swell breakfast. Really; I don't know when I've ever had a -- a nicer breakfast.
F	APRIL	Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it too.
M	FRANK	Then you don't -- You don't hate me, or anything?
F	APRIL	No; of course I don't.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Have a good day.
M	FRANK	Okay, then... So long.
F	APRIL	Hello... Milly? Everything all right? My voice sounds what...?
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling any better... If it's not an inconvenience for you... This evening would be great. What...? Oh, well- no, not if they're outdoors playing. Don't call them in.
M	APRIL (CONT'D)	Just give them - you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know... All right, Milly. Thanks. I think I need an ambulance.... Yes... One one five Revolutionary Road.
M	SHEP	Frank? They tell you what happened?
M	FRANK	Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even understand half the things he told me. He said the fetus was out before they got her here. He said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit, the placenta and now she's still bleeding. He said she'd lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came, and now they're trying to stop it, and he said a whole lot of things I didn't get, about capillaries, and he said she's unconscious. Jesus.
M	SHEP	How about sitting down, Frank.
M	FRANK	What the hell do I want to sit down for!
M	SHEP	Okay. Take it easy.
M	FRANK	My God.
M	SHEP	Here, have a cigarette.
M	FRANK	She did it to herself, Shep.
M	FRANK (CONT'D)	She did it to herself.
M	SHEP	I'll get some coffee.
M	FRANK	No. No. No.
M	DOCTOR	Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.
M	SHEP	Sit down Frank.
F	MILLY	...It was the worst experience of my life. Such wonderful people. Weren't they Shep? Poor April. Frank lives in the city now. Where is it he works?
M	SHEP	Bart Pollock Associates.
