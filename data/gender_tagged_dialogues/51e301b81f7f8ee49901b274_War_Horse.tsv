M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	FARMER	Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl. Easy.
M	FARMER 2	This is a stubborn one, huh?
M	FARMER 3	There we go. Who's a clever girl?
M	FARMER 2	Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on, steady does it. The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the
M	AUCTION MAN 1	Mornin', pop. Put your mark here. Good luck.
M	AUCTION MAN 2	Get the colt...
M	AUCTION MAN 3	Whoa! Whoa!
M	AUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D)	Easy...
M	DAD	Now that's a beauty.
M	SI EASTON	Forget it, Ted. He's half thoroughbred and not got a day's work in him. Now, there... There's your ticket.
M	DAD	But look at him, Si. Look at that creature. Don't be daft. You need something solid to plow a field.
M	DAD	Yeah, but he's something else, that one.
M	AUCTIONEER	Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle down - horses on my right - men with money in their pockets on my left - it's the perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?
M	FRED	YES! I's here.
M	AUCTIONEER	Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill?
M	DAVE	I'm here. Yes!
M	AUCTIONEER	Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been coming here for 20 years - never bought so much as a pork scratching.
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my wife on our wedding day. Let's get going, shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature.
M	DAD	One guinea.
M	AUCTIONEER	One guinea, one guinea, one guinea...
M	YOUNG ANDREW EASTON	I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister Narracott.
M	AUCTIONEER	Any advance on one guinea? Any advance on one guinea?
F	LYONS	Two guineas.
M	DAD	Three!
M	SI EASTON	Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong animal.
M	DAD	Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that bastard see me off.
F	LYONS	Five guineas.
M	DAD	Six! Oh for the love of...!
F	LYONS	Seven.
M	DAD	Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody. Eight.
M	SI EASTON	Stop it - he's your landlord - you can't be picking fights with him.
F	LYONS	Ten guineas.
M	SI EASTON	You haven't got the money. Let's go home - let's have a pint.
M	DAD	Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as any in this town.
M	AUCTIONEER	Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?
M	SI EASTON	That's top price for a workin' animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!
M	DAD	There are big days and there are small days. Which will it be?
M	AUCTIONEER	Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?
M	DAVID LYONS	Just let him go, dad, I don't care for him, he's too... jumpy.
F	LYONS	Shall we say - twenty five?
M	SI EASTON	Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
M	ANDREW	You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run for his money.
M	AUCTIONEER	Going, going...
M	DAD	Thirty. Thirty guineas!
M	AUCTIONEER	Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott.
M	SI EASTON	What have you done, Ted? What have you done?
F	LYONS	Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do with him - on a working farm? I hope you got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it when it comes due.
M	SI EASTON	You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll never forgive you.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	What have you done?
M	ALBERT	That's Mooney's colt!
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	You were supposed to buy a plow horse.
M	ALBERT	You bought him? MRS. NARRACOTT What'd you pay for him?
M	MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)	How much, Ted Narracott?
M	DAD	I won't tell you a lie - though I would love to. Thirty guineas.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Thirty guineas!
M	MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)	He's not worth ten! Are you out of your mind? What about the rent?
M	DAD	He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at the way he holds his head!
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that? Ted - you have to take him back. You have to take him back right now now.
M	ALBERT	No.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back.
M	ALBERT	No. No, please don't take him back.
M	DAD	We can't take him back till he's broken in.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	And how are you gonna train a horse with that leg? ALBERT I'll train him.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't know nothing about horses.
M	ALBERT	Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it.
M	DAD	We have to keep him. We've no choice.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Right. Well... you've got one month to break him in or I'm taking him back myself. How did you get to thirty - what other fool bid you up that high?
M	DAD	It was Lyons.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	We're gonna lose everything. After all we've been through - we're gonna lose it all.
M	ALBIE	Don't worry, Mum - I'll raise him - and I'll raise him good.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Well, you better. Go on - get started. See if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours. ALBERT Right. Let's make a start then.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's beef and gravy to us!
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Come on...
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	I bet you're missing your mother. Look at you... first time without your mum. First time away from home. But you're not alone, are you. In fact. Cos I'm `ere...
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	It's alright. It's alright.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey. That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright, You're mine now. You're mine.
M	ALBERT	Whoa. I want you to stay there, Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy. That's it, you've got it.
M	ANDREW	Hey, look at him, Albie. He's playing "Grandma's Footsteps."
M	ALBERT	Right, come on, Joey. Back you go. Come on. Back you go. You're all right. That's it. Good boy. Right. You've gotta stay there, understand?
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	That's it. Good boy. You've got it. Good boy.
M	ANDREW	Good boy. Good. Now call him. Whistle.
M	ALBERT	Come now, Joey. Come on.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	You can come now, Joey.
M	ANDREW	Don't think he fancies your owls.
M	ALBERT	No, I read it in a story. It's how the Indians used to summon their horses. He gently strokes Joey's nose.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've gotta come, understand?
M	ANDREW	My dad had a dog who stayed when you called him. He used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and uh...
M	ALBERT	He's not a dog. He's just puzzling it through.
M	ANDREW	Brilliant. Look at you.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Albie.
F	LYONS	There's only fifteen here.
M	DAD	The rest will come.
F	LYONS	You know by rights I could take this farm back today, don't you? And I'm a great believer in my rights.
M	DAD	It will come.
F	LYONS	If you drank less beer and bought fewer horses you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, Narracott.
M	DAD	I said I'll pay you. We got to plant the bottom field.
F	LYONS	Bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down there.
M	DAD	No, we're going to plow it. Just give me `til the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe you. With interest.
F	LYONS	How you going to plow it? Not with that fancy animal of yours?
M	DAD	He'll do it.
F	LYONS	You'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow. Even drunk on a Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't wait for the money - there's a war coming.
M	DAD	I promise you that field will be plowed. We'll plant it with turnips. And the money will be yours when harvest comes.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Please, sir. Please. Lyons takes his time. He looks at them both - Ted and Rosie,
F	LYONS	Very well - if that fancy plows that field I'll give you till October to set things straight.
M	ALBERT	What if he doesn't?
F	LYONS	I'll take the horse on the day he fails. And I'll take your father's farm and give it to working men who can hold their pints and
M	ALBERT	No, please. Sir, you can't do that.
F	LYONS	Now, now, now, lad. What - are you bladdered as well?! Ted Narracott - I got you down in my book!
M	ALBERT	You can't harness him.
M	DAD	He's got to be collared. Dad starts to grapple with Joey desperately flailing in an
M	ALBERT	No, you can't. Look, you're scaring him, Dad. You're scaring him. He... He can't take a plow!
M	DAD	He's got to plow! He won't be able to do it - he's too young - he's not even been backed yet....
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Ted!
M	ALBERT	It's alright, boy. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. Albert calms Joey down. Mrs. Narracott returns the harness
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes on him....
M	MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)	Ted. No. Ted, no!
M	DAD	He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!
M	ALBERT	Dad? He grabs the rifle, but Dad shoves him away.
M	DAD	Move aside.
M	ALBERT	Dad. Stop.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	You shoot that horse we have nothing. NO!
M	ALBERT	You were right what you said, Dad. "He'll do it," you told Lyons, "He'll plow that field." And he will! You'll see. He'll show you. We'll show you. We'll get it done. MUM Let go. Let go.
M	MUM (CONT'D)	Go back to the house.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Here, here. Some days are best forgotten. Today ain't one of them. Come on. Albert walks towards the stables - enters. And talks to Joey
M	ALBERT	How are you today, Joey? I don't know much about life, boy, but I do know that there are big days and there are small days. And most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone - but this - well, this is a big one. This is our big day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going to take this off - Well, if it's tough for you - it should be tough for me, too...
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn. Is that understood? And then we can be together, which is how I believe things are meant to be.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here we go. Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See? See? You've just gotta put your nose through.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	That's it. See? You've got it. You've got it. Good boy. There...
M	SI EASTON	Too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots. Even a sturdy plow horse'd never manage it alone.
M	ANDREW	Yet he will, I say.
M	SI EASTON	You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if Albert had told you so. It's a fine thing, loyal to your mate. Even if he is a bit barmy. A team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.
F	LYONS	Ted too squeamish to watch, is he? SI EASTON `Course he's watching.
F	LYONS	Well, you've raised him up a true Narracott, Ted, picture of his father, he is: not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible.
M	LYONS (CONT'D)	Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't admire you, myself among `em, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground. You've fettle enough for twenty men, but with a gimpy leg and the drinking - for the pain, isn't it, that you drink? - yeah, none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this. Makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place, not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours, thought you were a spark, she did.
M	LYONS (CONT'D)	And now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.
M	ALBERT	See Joey - I got the collar, too!
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Come on, boy. Walk on. That's it. Walk on!
F	LYONS	You'd be better off startin' at the top of the hill and goin' down! Gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad. ALBERT Walk on, Joey! Walk on! Come on, Joey, walk on. Walk on, boy.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Walk on. Come on, walk on.
M	TED	It'll take the whip to move him.
F	LYONS	Bravo! You've reached the top of the hill! Off you go again, boy! You'll make even better time comin' down!!
M	ALBERT	Good boy. Good lad. Good lad. Now walk on. Good boy.
M	ANDREW	Albie, we're all with ya!
F	LYONS	Look look look! The plow hasn't even cut yet!
M	ALBERT	Do you know - I believe we can do it, Joey. I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the best of us. That's why he bought you. He knows you've all the courage he never had. I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Whoa. Whoa. Lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall.
F	LYONS	You've got no chance, lad. He'll not turn over half an acre. Give it up now. You've done well. You've tried hard. You're more of a man than your father.
M	SI EASTON	Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it? LYONS Well, he'll destroy that horse. I'll be over Thursday. Give you a day to close it up.
M	NEIGHBOUR	Your wool. I'm sorry, Rosie.
M	ALBERT	Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey. You don't know, so I'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! So get set to pull - and pull straight! And pull hard!
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Now, boy! Go!
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it! Good boy, Joey! Good boy!
M	ANDREW	Walk on! Walk on! Walk on! Walk on, Joey! Go around it!!
M	ALBERT	Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey, whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll break the blade -
M	ANDREW	Will you look at you?
F	LYONS	I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade. He could lose a foot!
M	ROSIE NARRACOTT	You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son! Or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm! Dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Come on, Albie! Push on through!
M	ANDREW	Get it done, Albie! Get it done! ROSIE Oh, my pair of fools. My mighty fools.
M	ROSIE	You're as battered and bloodied as he is.
M	ALBERT	And where's Dad?
M	ROSIE	Still in the bottom field.
M	ALBERT	Stumbling about, I suppose.
M	ROSIE	It's not the drink, Albert, that makes him stumble -
M	ALBERT	He drinks, mum.
M	ROSIE	Well, so might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen!
M	ALBERT	Well, he don't talk to me about it.
M	ROSIE	He don't talk about it because he can't. There aren't words for some things. Come here...
M	ROSIE (CONT'D)	The mice've been at it. Sit down.
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. Then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two
M	ROSIE	And that is the Queen's South Africa Medal. Every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those. But this... That's the Distinguished Conduct Medal.
M	ALBERT	Not dad's?
M	ROSIE	Well it ain't mine, dear. He got that after the fighting at Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well... I don't know what else, he won't tell me either. But the first day he got home he just... tossed them out. First day he could walk, he threw `em straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I said not to. Albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant. She See, what you done today, you and Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy. It's good to be proud when you done something good. But what he done, in Africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it. Hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, I suppose.
M	ALBERT	I'd be proud. If I'd gone off to war. If I'd gone and saved my mates, and -
M	ROSIE	Well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him... Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.
M	ROSIE (CONT'D)	Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made - but he never gave up and he does that for us. And today, you showed the world it's all been worth it.
M	ROSIE (CONT'D)	You keep looking after Joey and he'll always be looking after you.
M	ALBERT	Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. You see this, Joey? It's been through an entire war.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	I'm not stealing it. I'll give it back to him, someday.
F	DAVID	Um, I'm the only boy that drives in the village. No one else drives but me.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Oh, yeah?
F	DAVID	That's right and this is my dad's car. You're lucky that you're in it. I'm not normally allowed to drive it `cause it's so -
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Is he a friend of yours?
M	ALBERT	Come on, boy, let's show her how to fly! Well...you're clearly not gonna be a jumper. Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo!
M	ALBERT	We can try planting something else, or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent?
F	MRS. NARRACOTT	What we gonna do?
M	DAD	I used to believe that God gave each man his fair portion of bad luck. I don't feel that any more. I've had more than my share. You'll stop loving me, Rose. And I won't blame you when you do.
F	ROSE	Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never love you less. Then somewhere in the distance, an unfamiliar sound...
M	MOTORBIKE RIDER	It's war! The bike comes to a stop in the market place. The rider takes
M	MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)	We are at War with Germany. You hear? England is at war with Germany.
M	MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)	They're going to ring the bells at six o'clock - and then never ring them again until the war is over.
M	ALBERT	Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock Fair!
M	ALBERT	What has he done with him?
M	RECRUITING OFFICER	Last name first. First name, middle name, last.
M	DAD	Take my word for it - finest horse in the parish. Goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine.
M	SAM PERKINS	No curbs, no splints, good feet and teeth. He's as sound as a bell, sir.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	And how much are you charging, sir - for this strong, decent, and very fine animal?! DAD Forty.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I'll give you twenty and not a penny more.
M	DAD	Twenty is no good to me, Captain. Thirty five and he's yours.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I don't even know how he rides.
M	DAD	Oh, he rides... Splendidly. You'll be astonished. I promise you that. Finest horse in all of Devon. Finest horse I ever seen.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Thank you.
M	ALBERT	You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained him!
M	DAD	Albert.
M	ALBERT	You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just paid thirty guineas for him.
M	ALBERT	Please, I'll get you money. I will, I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work for it! I'll work for it. He won't obey anyone else. He won't be any good in the war, neither. He...he shies at every sound!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I'm sorry.
M	ALBERT	Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too. I'm volunteering.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I see. What's your name, lad?
M	ALBERT	Albert, sir.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	And how old are you, Albert?
M	ALBERT	Nineteen, sir.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLS	Is that the truth?
M	ALBERT	No sir. But, but I look nineteen and I'm bigger than most nineteen-year- olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And I...I'm not afraid of anything.
M	NICHOLLS INTERJECTS:	
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering, and your father's done what he had to do. You know that. Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey, I know that. But it's all I've got. Will you lease him to me, Albert, to be my own mount? I promise you, man to man, that I'll look after him as closely as you've done, I'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him. And if I can - I'll return him to your care.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	Now say goodbye.
M	ALBERT	It's all right, boy...
M	SAM PERKINS	All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough. He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way. Come on.
M	DAD	Do you want to lose the farm, Rose?
M	ROSIE	It's the way you did it.
M	DAD	But we're at war.
M	ROSIE	Aren't we just.
M	ALBERT	Joey...
M	SAM PERKINS	Here now, I've told you - sling your hook!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Let him be, Perkins. ALBERT This isn't the end. This isn't the end, my brother... I, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again. Wherever you are, I will find you. And I will bring you home!
M	SAM PERKINS	Whoa. Steady, steady. Steady now, come on. Walk on! Walk on now, come on! GROOM Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy...
M	SAM PERKINS	Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin' about, you hear? Yer in the army now, son.
M	SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)	Good boy, good boy. Steady steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy, back up. Joey rears up in his stall.
M	SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)	Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the two of you, you hear? If you want to fight, you get it over with - `cause once we're over there, you're gonna need everything you've got for Fritz!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.
M	SAM PERKINS	There'll be nothing gentle about the war, sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about this one either!
M	SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)	I understand that, Sergeant, but I want him fit and shining. He's my horse.
M	SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)	Sir.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Scares the living daylights out of me.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Who?
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Perkins. Glad he's on our side.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not a patch on my Topthorn.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got potential. He's certainly got the bit between his teeth.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	I actually think my Blenheim is faster than the pair of them.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Clear off!
M	MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)	All right, gentlemen, listen here. Everything tells us the same story, from Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first attack can and should be the decisive one. Perkins...
M	SAM PERKINS	Yes, sir!
M	MAJOR STEWART	No excuses, no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit for presentation! I want a full practice charge tomorrow.
M	SAM PERKINS	Sir. Finally, Nicholls and Charlie reach Stewart and Topthorn
M	MAJOR STEWART	Thought you two had bottled out.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	As if.
M	MAJOR STEWART	All right, then, let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we?
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	This is what quiet confidence looks like.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Over to you, Captain Nicholls.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Draw...swords!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	Give...point!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	Charge!!!!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	Come on, Joey. I know you've got it. Come on, boy! Come on!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	Come on, boy!
M	MAJOR STEWART	Whoa. Whoa.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Nice of you to turn up.
M	MAJOR STEWART	He's got speed...I'll give him that. But has he got stamina?
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	He has everything.
M	MAJOR STEWART	What are you up to?
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I'm writing a letter.
M	MAJOR STEWART	With a picture in it? CAPTAIN NICHOLLS It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to show him how wonderful he's looking.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Before we take him away across the Channel to face a million Germans guns.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Yes. Before that...
M	MAJOR STEWART	4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport detachment - they'll need to be at the docks at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Of course.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Charlie...
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Jamie.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Charlie.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	What do you think of the cap?
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)	Silk lining. I quite like it.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the Germans.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it - you're a Boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good Lord - one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed!" You might shoot the other one instead.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Or, alternatively, think - "I fancy that cap" and kill you first of all.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Hadn't thought of that.
M	SGT. MAJOR SINGH	That is our target - the German 11th Division - at the moment bivouacked three miles to the east of the Menin Road. We have been watching them and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires. Knock them out - and we could slide in behind the German lines and come at them from the South at Geluveld. MAJOR STEWART Excellent.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Numbers?
M	SGT. MAJOR SINGH	About six hundred. Infantry.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Twice our size...
M	MAJOR STEWART	In regiments of horse and men, the advantage is ours.
M	SGT. MAJOR SINGH	And we have surprise on our side. But the sooner we move, the better - we have no assurance they'll still be there tomorrow morning.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Right. Good. So - today it is. Charlie - tell the men.
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Salisbury formation?
M	MAJOR STEWART	Salisbury formation. We'll charge through them and secure the ground behind.
M	SGT. MAJOR SINGH	The grass to the left is taller than we are - it's perfect cover.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Excellent work, Sergeant Major. Time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Thank you, Singh. Jamie!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	They have no idea we're coming.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Not having scruples, are you, Jim?
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	No. I understand the surprise is everything. But if it must be done, let's do it quickly.
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	Are you alright, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE WAVERLY	Never been better. Literally, never better.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Prepare to mount! Mount!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Thank you, Standley. Hey, Joey. My bonny boy. You're all right, aren't you, Joey? Hey?
M	MAJOR STEWART	Gentleman. It is an honour to ride beside you. Make the Kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us. Let every man make himself, his King, his country, and his fallen comrades proud! Be brave. Fear God. Honor the King!
M	TROOPERS	Fear God. Honor the King!
M	MAJOR STEWART	Draw swords! The men draw their sabres in silence. The birds chirping,
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	Good luck, my friends.
M	MAJOR STEWART	Forward, to walk! Walk...march! Forward to canter! Canter...march!
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	Kavallerie!
M	CAPTAIN NICHOLLS	CHARGE!
M	GERMAN OFFICER	What? Did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended? Look at yourself! Who do you think you are?!!
M	JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER.	What do we do with the horses?
M	GERMAN OFFICER	If they're injured, shoot them.
M	JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER	And the others, sir?
M	GERMAN OFFICER	The others you round up and take to base camp - they will pull guns.
M	THIRD OFFICER	You'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns.
M	GERMAN OFFICER	Then shoot them also.
M	GUNTHER	Sir - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field.
M	GERMAN OFFICER	Will they take the harness?
M	GUNTHER	I'd like to try, sir.
M	MICHAEL	It won't work - they're cavalry
M	GUNTHER	Let's try.
M	MICHAEL	You won't get the harness on.
M	GUNTHER	Come on, Michael.
M	GUNTHER (CONT'D)	Whoa, whoa. Easy, now, easy now, Englishman... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now, easy.
M	MICHAEL	Gunther! It's hopeless - we can't help them.
M	GUNTHER	Well, well, look at you. Whoever taught you this has just saved your life.
M	SI EASTON	Hello the farm!
M	ROSIE	Hello, Si Easton!
M	SI EASTON	I was at the post office and while I was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel had come for Albert, from the, from the, from over there - and I thought I could go up that way in the morning. And - here it is.
M	ALBERT	Well, who'd be sending me a parcel over there?
M	DAD	Well, open it and see.
M	ALBERT	It's a sketchbook... That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook! See that? That's a picture of Joey! ROSIE It's a picture of Joey. Well, I never!
M	ALBERT	And there's a letter...
M	ROSIE	Well, go on then, go on.
M	ALBERT	All right. "Dear Albert Narracott. Captain Nicholls, who died...Captain Nicholls, who died in action today left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins.
M	ROSIE	You weren't to know it was bad news.
M	ALBERT	He was riding Joey when he died.
M	ROSIE	You don't know that he was riding him...
M	ALBERT	"In action," it says. Gentlemen! We move forward to the frontline tonight. Full marching orders. Get moving!
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	Schroeder! Schroeder! No, not you - you. Come.
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)	I'm keeping you here. You are best with the horses and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continue to push through from the west.
M	GUNTHER	They're pushing through?
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	I'm told. We will move later when we find where the horses are needed most.
M	GUNTHER	Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my brother here with me, he's also very good with horses.
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	Oh no no. Not necessary. Get moving. We leave tonight.
M	MICHAEL	It's all right, Gunther.
M	GUNTHER	You are not going. I'll tell them you are only fourteen, that you're a boy.
M	MICHAEL	Father signed me in. He knew my age -and so do they. Mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt.
M	GUNTHER	Of course she did. I just wasn't listening. But you need to listen now! I promised her, I made her a solemn promise, that you would be safe with me. With me, Michael!!
M	GUNTHER (CONT'D)	They'll never make a head count. There are too many of us. You can stay here - slip underneath the bed - until they move out.
M	MICHAEL	Then what?
M	MICHAEL (CONT'D)	Gunther, it will be fine. And when all the machines break down and they call up the horses, I'll see you at the front. We'll be together again. Gunther...
M	GUNTHER	I'm giving this to you. For luck. To keep you safe.
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	Im schnellschritt! Marsch...links! Zwei, drei, vier!
M	GERMAN OFFICER	Get back in line! Line!
M	MICHAEL	I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
M	GUNTHER	I'm sorry.
M	MICHAEL	Will Father be ashamed?
M	GUNTHER	He will pretend to be. Maybe at first he will be. But in the end, he will be glad.
M	MICHAEL	And us? What about us? I was ready to go. I was proud to go. I wanted to go.
M	MICHAEL (CONT'D)	The food in Italy is good.
M	GUNTHER	Yes.
M	MICHAEL	What about the women?
M	GUNTHER	Not as good as the food.
M	MICHAEL	Because...they've eaten too much of the food?
M	GUNTHER	You are too young for war. And you're too young for women!
M	MICHAEL	I don't feel so young. Not anymore.
M	MICHAEL (CONT'D)	Michael. What?
M	GUNTHER	Go to sleep - we have a big night of riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael.
M	MICHAEL	Night night, Gunther.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	Hei! In die windmühle!
M	GUNTHER	Go, go, go...
M	MICHAEL	Okay.
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	Schroeder.
M	GUNTHER	Yes, sir.
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	A mistake? He's offering an excuse, but -
M	GUNTHER	A promise.
M	BASE CAMP OFFICER	Ja...
F	EMILIE	Grandpére. It's closer today.
M	GRANDFATHER	The wind plays tricks with the noise - it's moving away from us.
F	EMILIE	I can hear it, Grandpére, and there is no wind. You shouldn't lie to me.
M	GRANDFATHER	Here. There is no wind here. But over there - a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground...
F	EMILIE	You lie about everything. You say you aren't worried but it's clear you are. I know the war is approaching but you say, "Oh, it's just a trick of the wind."
M	GRANDFATHER	Did I say that?
F	EMILIE	You started lying when Mama and Papa went away.
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	They're dead. But you won't say so. Do you think I'll die if you tell me the truth?
M	GRANDFATHER	The truth is - He feeds her a spoonful of the medicine.
M	GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)	- you should speak to your elders with respect.
F	EMILIE	If you tell me the truth about the war, I will tell you the truth about the big horses I've been keeping in the windmill.
M	GRANDFATHER	Now - who is the one telling lies!
M	GRANDFATHER	In the windmill?
F	EMILIE	Yes. They were standing in the windmill waiting for Don Quixote. This is François (Joey) and this is Claude (Topthorn).
M	GRANDFATHER	Yeah.
F	EMILIE	I named them after two boys who broke my heart last Summer.
M	GRANDFATHER	They must belong to someone. Horses like this don't just appear from a fairy-tale.
F	EMILIE	Yes - I know, Grandpére. They are not unicorns - so I will be fair and wait -- one day.
M	GRANDFATHER	Emilie... Emilie...
F	EMILIE	And if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me.
M	GRANDFATHER	Emilie. Look at me. You cannot ride.
F	EMILIE	Mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall.
M	GRANDFATHER	Yes. That's right. So it is settled? She kisses his cheek --
M	GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)	Good girl.
F	EMILIE	It will only be settled when I decide which one to ride first.
M	GRANDFATHER	But it's - Over my dead body!
F	EMILIE	At least I won't have long to wait.
F	EMILIE	I was in love with a boy called François - who had your lovely eyes. Unfortunately he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth. She fell for a boy called Claude - who broke my heart. And who I intend to marry one day.
M	EMILIE (O.S.)	Eyes on me. No talking. Today we learn to jump. Did you know the French cleared one meter eighty- five at the Paris Olympics to win the gold medal? Today we will beat that record.
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	This is your jump. When I call you....be very brave and leap over it.
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	Leap over it! Watch me. And now it's your --
F	EMILIE	He doesn't think we can do it. But we will show him, won't we?
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	No need to be afraid. You are...very tall.
M	GRANDFATHER	You'll kill yourself.
F	EMILIE	Only if you get in my way to make me fall.
M	GRANDFATHER	Oh please, come off the ladd-- Find somewhere to hide them. And do it quickly!!!
M	GERMAN OFFICER	Halt! Und aussteigen!
M	GRANDFATHER	My name is Bonnard - this is my land. Why are you here?
M	SOLDIERS	Food for the soldiers at the front. Everyone must give their share.
M	GRANDFATHER	They are taking everything. Where are the horses?
F	EMILIE	What horses?
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	What is it?
M	GRANDFATHER	Leave it if you don't know what it's for.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	A pot is a pot. We'll find some use for it. Sir, where's the livestock? Brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam
M	GRANDFATHER	I make jam. We have no animals.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	But there's fresh hay in your barn.
F	EMILIE	We use it to replace the mattress stuffings.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	Her grandfather?
M	GRANDFATHER	Yes.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	Where are her parents?
F	EMILIE	They're dead. They died.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	What is that?
M	GRANDFATHER	The wind. It plays tricks in the attic.
M	BRANDT	There is no wind.
M	GRANDFATHER	An old house creaks. Go - close the shutters.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	She's sickly, no? GRANDFATHER If you or any of your friends harm her, as old as I am, I will kill you.
M	GERMAN SOLDIER	You know, I was going to give you back your pot. But now I'm going to keep it. For soup.
M	BRANDT	We will be back in the new season. EMILIE Tell me what happened to them. To my mother and father. You said you would tell me how they died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's my birthday! They died fighting, didn't they? But when the soldiers COME -
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	- you do nothing. You are a coward, aren't you? GRANDFATHER Yes. Yes. It was your parents who were brave. I make jams.
F	EMILIE	And you've never done a brave thing in your life?
M	GRANDFATHER	Maybe there are different ways to be brave. Did you know the French have the best carrier pigeons? And this could be the difference in the war - our messages getting through.
F	EMILIE	I don't want to hear about the birds.
M	GRANDFATHER	They are released at the front and told to go home - this is all they know. But to get there they must fly over a war. Can you imagine such a thing? Here you are flying over so much pain and terror - and you know you can never look down. You have to look forward or you'll never get home. I ask you - what could be braver than that?
F	EMILIE	What is that?
M	GRANDFATHER	A present.
F	EMILIE	I hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that I then have to wear like last year.
M	GRANDFATHER	It was disgusting?
F	EMILIE	Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	Give me your hand. Grandpére, we have no money. When the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages.
M	GRANDFATHER	Anything you say, my sweet one. Anything-you-say! You are, of course, the boss. It's just an old thing I found - don't worry yourself - leave it, I'll put it back. He leaves the room. Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it
M	GRANDFATHER	It was your mother's. I hid it, so as not to encourage you. Emilie, I want you to ride very slowly, very carefully. And promise me you won't go far --
F	EMILIE	Of course. Okay, I promise.
M	GRANDFATHER	To the top of the hill and straight back again.
F	EMILIE	I promise.
M	EMILIE (CONT'D)	My hero.
M	GRANDFATHER	Slowly...slowly...
M	GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)	Emilie!
M	GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)	Emilie!
F	EMILIE	No! Let go of me! No!
M	GRANDFATHER	She is my granddaughter! Emilie, stop! Don't hurt her, please! Don't hurt her.
F	EMILIE	You don't need them! There are so many others!
M	GRANDFATHER	Please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one. You are breaking my granddaughter's heart.
M	BRANDT	The war has taken everything from everyone.
M	GRANDFATHER	What will happen to them?
M	BRANDT	They will pull artillery until they DIE - EMILIE François!
M	BRANDT	- or until the war is over.
M	GRANDFATHER	It will never be over!
M	BRANDT	You have your answer then.
M	BRANDT	Heiglemann - these are yours.
M	FRIEDRICH	Yes, sir.
M	BRANDT	They look strong - should last a month or two. FRIEDRICH is an unprepossessing, chubby man. He marvels at
M	FRIEDRICH	You are beautiful.
M	FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)	It's a pity they found you.
M	FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)	Such a pity...
M	ARTILLERY OFFICER	Pull together! ARTILLERY SOLDIER Halt! Halt! Stop!
M	FRIEDRICH	Stop! Stop!
M	BRANDT	Heiglemann, bring up another one!
M	ARTILLERY OFFICER	Heiglemann, bring up another horse!
M	BRANDT	That one!
M	BRANDT (CONT'D)	No, no. The big black one!
M	FRIEDRICH	He's a good horse, sir. But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all. Prince is already losing condition. His leg, sir.
M	BRANDT	You have given them names?
M	FRIEDRICH	Yes, sir.
M	BRANDT	You should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose. FRIEDRICH His leg is not good enough, sir.
M	BRANDT	Private, you will do as you are told. Hook him up.
M	FRIEDRICH	As you see, sir, this one is stronger. Brandt takes up Friedrich, and Joey's, offer -
M	BRANDT	Hook him up. Soldiers scurry around the giant gun, preparing it.
M	OFFICER	Halt! Halt! Take the horses away!
M	ARTILLERY OFFICER	Shell!
M	ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)	And load!
M	ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)	Back! Case! - and secure it. Position!
M	ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)	And...fire!
M	SERGEANT MARTIN	Valuables in the bucket, lads. If you live, you'll get them back. If you live, you'll get them back. Good lads.
M	ANDREW	Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe it's a drill like last time.
F	DAVID	Love letter?
M	ALBERT	That's my business.
F	DAVID	I hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again. You gonna write a letter to your horse? After you find your horse, I've lost my needle in a haystack, and I could use some help.
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	Anything valuable. Anyone who comes back gets to share it out.
M	ALBERT	Stay here.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Remember that day me and Joey raced you in your car?
F	DAVID	I remember you somersaulting through the air.
M	ALBERT	Who was that girl you were with?
F	DAVID	There was a girl?
M	ALBERT	There was. Don't you remember?
F	DAVID	It was just some girl, I suppose. I don't recall which one. I do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch.
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	You see? Always entertaining, Narracott, I'll give you that.
M	ANDREW	You did that? You fell on your bum?
M	SERGEANT MARTIN	Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men, get ready to go! Get ready to move out! Stay in position!
F	DAVID	Hold your nerve, boys. Remember, it's not far to go. There's a way through. Run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open and God and the King will keep an eye on you. Company will fix bayonets! Fix bayonets! You know what it reminds me of out there?
M	ANDREW	What?
M	ALBERT	That bloody impossible lower field the day me and Joey plowed it. Best day of my life that was and you were there.
M	ANDREW	And this here is the worst day of my life, about to begin, and you're here cheering me on. Us two, always. And him.
F	DAVID	Once you're in no man's land, go to the flanks. Stay on the flanks.
M	SOLDIER	Yes, sir.
F	DAVID	Come on, boys, come on. To the ladder!
M	ALBERT	Stick close to the gentry, that's our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck but they have the luck. They both smile. And then the fear takes over again. Andrew
F	DAVID	You, too, Narracott. And you, too.
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	Come on, on your ladders, boy. On your ladders. In you go, in you go. That's it.
M	SERGEANT MARTIN	Listen to your sergeant!
M	SERGEANT MARTIN (CONT'D)	If anybody turns back, if any one of our boys come running towards you - you take this rifle and you shoot them dead. Do you understand?
M	SOLDIERS	Yes, sir!
M	SERGEANT	Do you understand me? Do you understand what I'm telling you, son? You take this rifle and you shoot them dead. Understand?
M	SERGEANT (CONT'D)	Up there, son. Up your ladder. Up your ladder to your work! Albert looks nervously back at Albert, comforting.
M	ALBERT	It's good. Andrew, it's good. Andrew! Nobody's retreating today. Andrew! Andrew! Nobody. Is retreating. Today.
F	DAVID	I'm shot! No!
M	DAVID (CONT'D)	Just leave me. Leave me!
M	ALBERT	You'll be all right here. You'll be safe. Someone'll come for ya.
F	DAVID	Albert. Albert, listen...
M	ALBERT	It's all right. It's all right. We're Devon boys, yeah? David looks at Albert as though seeing him for the first
F	DAVID	Yeah...
M	RANDOM SOLDIER	Get down! Albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole,
M	ANDREW	
M	ANDREW (CONT'D)	Albie.
M	ALBERT	We made it. We made it.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Andrew, this way out! Suddenly ANOTHER SOLDIER leaps from a trench branch between
M	SOLDIER	Gas! Gas! Gas!
M	ANDREW	Albie...
M	GERMAN OFFICER	Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep them moving.
M	FRIEDRICH	Sir, there's something wrong. This one needs to rest.
M	GERMAN OFFICER	There's no rest for them. Move them along. Move them along!
M	FRIEDRICH	Please, please, please. Stay on your feet. No, please. No no no...
M	FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)	Please please... Stay on your feet.
M	FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)	Come on. Please please...
M	GERMAN OFFICER	They're coming! Leave it, private!
M	GERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D)	Leave it! Come with me!
M	FRIEDRICH	Go to hell!
M	FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)	Run. Run! Run! Run!
M	GEORDIE SOLDIER (O.S.)	Stand to, stand to -
M	GEORDIE SOLDIER (CONT'D)	There's something moving.
M	SOLDIER	What the hell is it?
M	GEORDIE SOLDIER	It looks like a cow. What the hell would a cow be doing out there?
M	SOLDIER 2	That definitely isn't a cow.
M	SOLDIER	Well, what is it?
M	SECOND GERMAN	It can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be out there.
M	THIRD GERMAN	It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse.
M	SECOND GERMAN	Yes - it's a horse. The second German looks through the periscope, stunned.
M	THIRD GERMAN	It's a horse.
M	PETER	Yeah, it's a horse.
M	BRITISH CAPTAIN	Well, bugger me. It's a horse.
M	GEORDIE SOLDIER	Lads, we should call him.
M	BRITISH SOLDIER	How do you call a horse?
M	PETER	He's caught on the wire.
M	GEORDIE SOLDIER	Oh sod it...
M	BRITISH CAPTAIN	What do you think you're doing? Get back, do you hear me? Corporal, that's an order! Get back!
M	BRITISH SOLDIER	Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him. PETER What's he doing?
M	SECOND GERMAN	It's a trap.
M	PETER	No, I don't think so. I think he's trying to help.
M	THIRD GERMAN	Scare him back into his hole.
M	GEORDIE	It's a white flag, ent it? You see the white flag!? I'm just after tending to this here horse, is all!
M	BRITISH CAPTAIN	Get back, you stupid git!
M	GEORDIE	The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he leadeth me into green pastures, he lay me down beside the still waters...
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	Poor beastie. Poor babbie. It's alright. It's alright. Don't buck and wriggle so, you're only shredding yourself.
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	You'll blind yourself. Bugger me worthless - I didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut THE -
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	OW! DAMN! OW!!
M	PETER	I thought perhaps you might need these. He holds out the wire cutters. The Geordie, still
M	PETER (CONT'D)	For the barbed wire?
M	GEORDIE	Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks. Cheers. Cheers...
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	Thanks.
M	PETER	That...That's a very long strand. When you cut it, it's going to release this -
M	PETER (CONT'D)	- and this, and this, and they'll coil back rather violently, which I'm afraid will only wound the poor fellow further.
M	GEORDIE	You speak good English.
M	PETER	I speak English well. May I?
M	PETER (CONT'D)	What if we cut his head free first? So he won't try to stand up and blind himself? And then -
M	GEORDIE	Pity you didn't bring a second pair. Then I could cut the wire here -
M	PETER	WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS! The Geordie positions himself across Joey's body so that when
M	PETER (CONT'D)	His blind spot. The cutters won't frighten him. If you could cut here, holding this wire - I could -
M	GEORDIE	Say no more, I'm right behind you.
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	And you understand what's happening, do you not, O Best Beloved? That you must lay so very nice and still. There's a lad, you're a remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you. There's a lad. There's a remarkable lad.
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	So how's things in yonder trench?
M	PETER	Delightful. We read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks.
M	GEORDIE	Well, if ever you need any more rats, we can always send ours over. `Cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking. Besides, they scare off all the pretty girls.
M	PETER	Our girls aren't afraid of rats. GEORDIE Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind what gives robust massages?
M	PETER	Every Thursday! And they bring rum cake on your birthday.
M	GEORDIE	Look at that horse! Look at the muscles he's got, them long legs. They're made for running, horses. Runnin' away from danger.
M	PETER	Running away is all they have.
M	GEORDIE	Yet we taught `em opposite. Running into the fray.
M	PETER	War horse.
M	GEORDIE	Yeah. War horse. And there he is. What a strange beast you've become.
M	PETER	And now? GEORDIE I take him back with me, yeah?
M	PETER	Since I supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. This is fair, no?
M	GEORDIE	In a pig's eye. He's English, plain to see.
M	PETER	Oh, you mean because he's so filthy?
M	GEORDIE	Because he's so smart. And you're none too clean yourself.
M	PETER	We could box. And the winner gets the horse.
M	GEORDIE	No, thanks, pet. Must be careful not to start a war. Do you have a coin of any sort?
M	PETER	Coin toss?
M	GEORDIE	Yeah. He takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the Geordie, who
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	All right, Fritz - you're on.
M	PETER	My name is not Fritz - it is Peter.
M	GEORDIE	Peter - I'm Colin.
M	PETER	You call it, Colin.
M	GEORDIE	Heads. Peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud. They
M	PETER	That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not look pleased with me. The horse is yours.
M	GEORDIE	Gone quiet, hasn't it?
M	PETER	Yes. But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again.
M	GEORDIE	I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe I'll ever hit the target.
M	PETER	Thanks.
M	PETER (CONT'D)	Cheerio, mate. You'll take good care of him, yes?
M	GEORDIE	I will.
M	PETER	Our strange beast. And you take care of your own strange self.
M	PETER	Colin! A pair of German cutters - in memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.
M	GEORDIE	Thanks. I'll use `em back in the garden in South Shields. You keep your head down, now, Pete me lad!
M	PETER	Remarkable! A remarkable horse!
M	SERGEANT MARTIN	We're full up. Move on.
F	DAVID	The gas got him - we had to wait till morning.
M	MEDICAL OFFICER	This can't be all of us.
M	SERGEANT MARTIN	This is all. All walking wounded, away to the dressing station! Away to the dressing station!
M	DOCTOR	What's this doing here?
M	GEORDIE	We need a vet, sir.
M	DOCTOR	There are no vets. We've scarcely any horses left.
M	GEORDIE	He's cut all over, but this leg here's got the worst of it.
M	DOCTOR	It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
M	GEORDIE	Please, sir -
M	DOCTOR	I've all these men to take care of, corporal, you can see that, can't you?
M	GEORDIE	Please, sir, this horse can pull through anything.
M	ALBERT	What is it?
M	AN ORDERLY	It's a horse they found, wandering about in No Man's Land. Down you go.
M	ALBERT	What kind of an horse?
M	AN ORDERLY	Bloody miraculous kind of an horse, be my guess. Nothing makes it out of No Man's Land.
M	ALBERT	Miraculous horse...
M	GEORDIE	He was alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives, so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well, we have high hopes for him - DOCTOR You should shoot him now.
M	GEORDIE	Oh, but I can't.
M	DOCTOR	It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not going to mend.
M	DOCTOR (CONT'D)	Sergeant. Put him out of his misery.
M	SERGEANT FRY	Ladies, if you please.
M	SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)	All right, back off. Back off. The sergeant cocks his pistol.
M	SOLDIER	Go on. Do it again. One more whistle.
M	ALBERT	Joey?
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	Hello, Joey. Hello boy. Where you been then, hey? Where in the world you been?
M	DOCTOR	Do you know this man?
M	DOCTOR (CONT'D)	What's your name?
M	ALBERT	Narracott, Private Albert Narracott, sir.
M	DOCTOR	This is a random horse, Narracott, and too badly injured. Is this man in your care?
M	AN ORDERLY	Yes, sir.
M	ALBERT	He's not random at all, sir! He's my horse, I raised him, in Devon. Sir, look at his legs! He's got four white socks, he's brown all over - - and he has a white mark here - like so...
M	DOCTOR	Take him back.
M	AN ORDERLY	Come on, son.
M	GEORDIE	Wait! You can't see `cause of the mud.
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	Four white socks!
M	SERGEANT FRY	All right, break it up. Clear off, the lot of ya.
M	ALBERT	You see, sir? He's not random at all. DOCTOR We will attend to your horse. Patch him up best we can. Treat him like the soldier he is.
M	ALBERT	Thank you, sir. SERGEANT FRY Gentlemen! Gentlemen! It falls on me to give you some important news. At eleven o'clock today, in two minutes time - the War will come to an end.
M	SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)	The King and Queen thank you for your service. We have been victorious - even if at a higher price than many of us might have imagined. When the bells ring out - and they will in a moment, for the first time for four years - let us remember our brothers fallen in the field. And thank God for the end of this struggle and victory. ALBERT I don't understand, sir.
M	MAJOR TOMPKINS	Officers' horses only. All other horses are to be auctioned immediately.
M	SERGEANT FRY	That is a complete and bloody outrage. It's the lad's horse, sir, from Devon. He raised him up from a pup, he did. Trained him right up to the day when the army came to town.
M	MAJOR TOMPKINS	These aren't my orders, sergeant. You'll have to take him to market. That's all.
M	GEORDIE	We've all clubbed together. It's everything we have. There's twenty-nine pounds there. Buy him back.
M	ALBERT	Does the Major know?
M	GEORDIE	The Major put in ten.
M	GEORDIE (CONT'D)	Mum's the word where the Major's concerned. Your friend on the crutches over there - - even asked the Major to say that Joey was his, an officer's horse, so that he could go back with the others.
M	SERGEANT FRY	Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't want to miss the show. The intense bustle of the market. Farmers are gathered,
M	AUCTIONEER	Seven pounds! Seven pounds there! Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!
M	AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)	Eight pounds! Ten pounds here! Any advance? Sold!
M	GEORDIE	You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work horses.
M	AUCTIONEER	Next one. We start at four pounds. Four pounds. THE BUTCHER Eleven.
M	SERGEANT FRY	It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's been bidding for the best all morning.
M	AUCTIONEER	Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.
M	SERGEANT FRY	Let me handle this, private. Fifteen, and let that be an end to it. AUCTIONEER Fifteen pounds.
M	BUTCHER	Sixteen.
M	AUCTIONEER	Sixteen pounds.
M	SERGEANT FRY	Seventeen.
M	BUTCHER	Twenty of your English pounds. And let THAT be the end of it, my friend.
M	AUCTIONEER	Twenty pounds.
M	SERGEANT FRY	Twenty Five.
M	AUCTIONEER	Twenty five pounds.
M	BUTCHER	Twenty Six.
M	AUCTIONEER	Twenty six pounds. SERGEANT FRY Twenty seven.
M	BUTCHER	Twenty eight.
M	AUCTIONEER	Twenty eight pounds.
M	SERGEANT FRY	Twenty nine.
M	BUTCHER	And thirty.
M	AUCTIONEER	Any advance at thirty pounds?
M	FINAL BIDDER	One hundred pounds.
M	GRANDFATHER	And sir, if you bid against me, I will sell the coat on my back and bid to one hundred and ten. And if you bid against me again, I will sell my farm and bid to a thousand.
M	AUCTIONEER	One hundred pounds. Going, going, gone.
M	ALBERT	Sir, I'll give you all your money. Everything you paid when we get back to England. I'll give you twice -
M	GRANDFATHER	You don't know anything about him.
M	ALBERT	Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know everything!
M	GRANDFATHER	Yes, you found him! I heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies -
M	GEORDIE	No, I found him, he raised him -
M	GRANDFATHER	When I heard about the miracle horse, I traveled three days because I knew whose horse it was. My granddaughter's. She saved his life! He was everything to her.
M	GEORDIE	Where is your granddaughter?
M	GRANDFATHER	The war has taken everything from everyone. He is all that I have left of her.
M	ALBERT	Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I won't worry over you none. Hey, I found you, didn't I, and you found me.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	And we'll both... we'll both know that we made it through. Now go on. We're the lucky ones. Always have been. Lucky since the day I met you.
M	ALBERT (CONT'D)	God be with you, sir.
M	GRANDFATHER	Do you know what this is?
M	ALBERT	It's my father's. It's his regimental pennant. How did you come by this, sir?
M	GRANDFATHER	You may have this.
M	ALBERT	Thank you ever so much for this, sir...
M	GRANDFATHER	... And this.
M	GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)	No no, not necessary. He belongs to you. That is, of course, what my little girl would have wanted. And she was the boss.
M	ALBERT	What was her name? GRANDFATHER Emilie. Her name is Emilie. Albert dismounts and removes his cap. An instant later, Mrs.
