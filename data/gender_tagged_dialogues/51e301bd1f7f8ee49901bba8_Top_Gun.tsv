M	MAVERICK	HE'S STILL ON YOU, COUGAR.
M	WIZARD	He's running for it.
M	MAVERICK	Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

M	WIZARD	What makes you think we can get back in? We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
M	WIZARD	He's nine o'clock high. We're two thousand pounds low!
M	COUGAR	I'm pulling up.

M	GOOSE	We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
M	COUGAR	It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.

M	SILVER SUIT	Goose, can you hear me? Goose!
M	GOOSE	Oh, Hello... Valet parking?
M	SILVER SUIT	Son of a bitch!
M	GOOSE	You will put it up front, with the Porsches?
M	GOOSE	Hey...easy...Take it easy... I'm a veteran!
M	GOOSE	Can you check under the hood. I thought I heard a funny noise.
M	GOOSE	Lucy...Ricky...I'n Home!
M	GOOSE	Is it extra for the hot wax?
M	AIR BOSS	Clear the flight deck.
M	GOOSE	Well...there goes your tip.
M	WIZARD	It's Goose. He's alright. Bring it left...You're settling. IS THE DECK CLEAR? ROGER, BALL, LITTLE POWER...DON'T CLIMB...OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT!
M	GOOSE	On behalf of your Captain and your crew, I want to thank you for flying VF101. And next time your plans include the middle of the goddamn ocean in the dead of frigging night, I hope you'll think of Naval Aviation.
M	SURGEON	Stress reaction...
M	GOOSE	Never mind my head, check my shorts!
M	Commander Tom Otawoczek	
M	STINGER	Come in.
M	STINGER	Cougar, what is it? You should be in sick bay. What are you doing?
M	COUGAR	Thinking of my wife and kid.
M	GOOSE	Cougar!
M	MAVERICK	Maverick, Goose...Come in here.
M	MAVERICK	Sir?
M	GOOSE	Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
M	STINGER	Don't.
M	MAVERICK	He's a good pilot.
M	STINGER	I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
M	GOOSE	He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
M	STINGER	Was.
M	MAVERICK	What?
M	STINGER	Was going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now you are.
M	MAVERICK	Me?
M	STINGER	and he needs someone to fly the plane.
M	GOOSE	Skipper, you can't do this!
M	STINGER	I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too.
M	GOOSE	Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
M	STINGER	I know some RIOS are a little wiggy...but you abuse the priviledge! I don't believe I'm going to have to put the two of you in the same cockpit...but there it is! It may be good for the Navy. It might be good for you, but most of all, it's good for me. It'll get you out of my sight.
M	GOOSE	But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
M	STINGER	Well, you'll just have to make do with him (indicates Maverick).
M	GOOSE	Mav's a great flyer but....
M	STINGER	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing. (SCREAMS) He just can't seem to follow orders!
M	STINGER	You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out
M	MAVERICK	Sir?
M	STINGER	That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir!
M	STINGER	Maverick..
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir..
M	STINGER	The wings..
M	STINGER	Gentlemen!
M	MAVERICK/GOOSE	Sir? His facade cracks just slightly.
M	STINGER	Good luck.
M	CHP	Son. Do you know why I stopped you?
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir. I do sir
M	CHP	Well... What is it?
M	MAVERICK	Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
M	CHP	License and registration.
M	CHP	Lieutenant, do you know how fast you were going?
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir. I do, Sir.
M	CHP	Well?
M	MAVERICK	Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
M	CHP	One SIXTH the speed of sound!
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir.
M	CHP	Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
M	MAVERICK	F-14's sir.
M	CHP	Tomcats?
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir!
M	CHP	Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
M	MAVERICK	No sir! But you have to be ready.
M	CHP	Lieutenant.
M	MAVERICK	Yes, Sergeant?
M	CHP	Remember one thing.
M	MAVERICK	Sir?
M	CHP	Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir!
M	ICE	Uh oh, police escort. This one must be a real killer.
M	VIPER (V.O.)	During the Korean War, the Navy kill ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down twelve of their jets for every one of ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to three-to-one. Our pilots depended on missles. They lost their dogfighting skills.
M	VIPER (V.O.)	Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air Combat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We do just what they did, but we do it beyond the speed of sound.
M	VIPER	By the end of Vietnam we upped our kill ratio to thirteen to one.
M	VIPER	You're here 'cause you're the top one per cent of all naval aviators.
M	VIPER (V.O.)	You're the elite, the best of the best. We're gonna make you better, because you're job is damned important.
M	VIPER (V.O.)	With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- carrier pilots will be the first ones there. Air combat excellence is vital.
M	VIPER	...Someone once asked me if training men for air combat made the world less safe--flying loaded guns... an accidental confrontation and so forth... My answer is: the dangerous thing is being unprepared. You want trouble, that's what you get when things don't work out, when you can't do what you say you can. When you don't know what you can do. And when your opponents aren't sure either. We are not policy. We don't make policy. Elected officials ...civilians, do that. We are the instrument of policy. The tip of the spear. So we had best be sharp.
M	GOOSE	What are you doing?
M	MAVERICK	Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
M	MAVERICK	...Just wondering...(turns back) ...who is the best.
M	VIPER	Ya know. We'd like to know who's best too. That's why we've got that plaque on the wall... with the Top Top Gun crew from each class. You think maybe your name's gonna be on it?
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir.
M	VIPER	Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir.
M	VIPER	I like that in a fighter pilot. It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir.
M	VIPER	Gentlemen, this is about combat. Remember, there are no points for second place. Dismissed. Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him,
M	WOLFMAN	A plaque?
M	HOLLYWOOD	It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
M	A7 PILOT	You know the Fighter Pilots motto? It's better to be dead than to look bad.
M	GOOSE	I don't know, Frank, anybody gets off on bombing the shit out of dirt has got to be queer.
M	GOOSE	Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
M	MAVERICK	Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
M	GOOSE	Gotta keep track of the competition.
M	GOOSE	Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
M	SLIDER	Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
M	GOOSE	The list is long, but distinguished.
M	SLIDER	So's my Johnson.
M	GOOSE	This is Maverick.
M	SLIDER	So I've heard.
M	GOOSE	Who's your pilot?
M	SLIDER	Tom Kazansky.
M	GOOSE	No shit. The Iceman....
M	SLIDER	Mister to you.
M	GOOSE	You think you can stay up with us.
M	SLIDER	I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
M	GOOSE	This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
M	SLIDER	So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
M	MAVERICK	Still is..
M	SLIDER	Yeah. That's what I meant.
M	SLIDER	What was that?
M	GOOSE	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it. GOOSE You can't show fear in front of Marines...They're like Doberman's they'll go for your throat, it's instinctive.
M	MAVERICK	You ever done this before?
M	GOOSE	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
M	SLIDER	How was it?
M	GOOSE	Could use a dash more jet fuel.
M	GOOSE	Careful, don't make an ash of yourself...
M	SUNDOWN	Yeow!
M	GOOSE	Mayday! Down in flames!
M	SUNDOWN	Thanks, I needed that.
M	HOLLYWOOD	You guys are not only crazy, you're dangerous! ICE Frat boys.
M	MAVERICK	Who is that guy?
M	HOLLYWOOD	That's Kazanski.
M	GOOSE	No shit! That why they call him Ice?
M	HOLLYWOOD	Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
M	GIRL	Why do you all have such funny names?
M	WOLFMAN	You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
M	GIRL	Why do they call you Wolf?
M	WOLDFMAN	Oh, I don't know.
M	GOOSE	Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
M	MAVERICK	Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead. ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS
M	GIRL	Could I get a call sign?
M	WOLFMAN	Well, I don't know. That depends.
M	GIRL	On what?
M	WOLFMAN	Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
M	GIRL	Like what?
M	WOLFMAN	Oh...I'll think of something.
M	ICEMAN	Figured it out yet?
M	MAVERICK	Figured out what?
M	ICEMAN	Who is the best.
M	MAVERICK	Nope.
M	ICEMAN	Need a hint?
M	MAVERICK	I think I can work it out on my own.
M	ICEMAN	You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
M	MAVERICK	I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
M	ICEMAN	And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
M	MAVERICK	He's a good man. ICEMAN The best.
M	SLIDER	You must have soloed under a lucky star. First the MiG, then you slide into Cougar's place.
M	GOOSE	It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
M	GOOSE	Did what?
M	ICE	Got you here.
M	GOOSE	We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
M	SLIDER	What luck! Guys fly their whole career without seeing a MiG up close...You're famous.
M	ICE	You mean notorious.
M	MAVERICK	What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
M	GOOSE	Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink. BUGS We were just really diving down and by then we were right over downtown Haiphong. It was some great shit. Jack says, "What are you doing?" "What, what am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like zooom... So we scraped down at hundred feet right over--downtown Hanoi! Oh shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the river. And so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet just going down the river and Jack says... "Bugs... don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, Jack, I'll never do that again!"
M	MAVERICK	What, what is it?
M	HOLLYWOOD	Target passing. Check your six.
M	MAVERICK	Never mind mine. Check hers.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to engage. HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
M	WOLFMAN	Bogey...9 o'clock level.
M	SUNDOWN	Nine thirty. Bogey? You presume that hostile?
M	Well, we should contact and check	it out.
M	GOOSE	The family unit -- that's the most important thing. It's the only thing you can count on. I'm married --did I tell you that?
M	FIRST GIRL	Four times. We don't believe you.
M	GOOSE	I've been married since I was eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
M	SECOND GIRL	Because you don't look married.
M	FIRST GIRL	You're not even wearing a ring.
M	GOOSE	I take it off when I'm chasing women. It's the only honorable thing to do.
M	HOLLYWOOD	You don't think about death up there, but you think a lot about the danger. One mistake and you're a smoking hole in the ground.
M	GIRL	I never knew it was so dangerous. HOLLYWOOD Oh yeah, it makes everything down here more meaningful. You feel a certain intensity of life, and you want to grab onto every moment.
F	CHARLIE	Long cruise, was it?
F	CHARLIE	Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
M	MAVERICK	Lots of things.
F	CHARLIE	I'll bet!
M	MAVERICK	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical,
F	CHARLIE	Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
F	CHARLIE	Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
M	MAVERICK	It's not that.
F	CHARLIE	It isn't?
M	MAVERICK	Well, it is. It is that, too.
F	CHARLIE	That's a big comfort to me.
M	MAVERICK	I could be, too.
F	CHARLIE	How so?
M	MAVERICK	Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
F	CHARLIE	And on to a bigger one with you?
M	MAVERICK	Yeah, most likely.
F	CHARLIE	Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
M	MAVERICK	I heard of one once.
F	CHARLIE	I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, but I don't go out with pilots.
M	MAVERICK	Then what are you doing here?
F	CHARLIE	I think the question is...what are you?
M	MAVERICK	Hi. I'm here to talk about a new concept in cosmetics...
F	CHARLIE	Sorry.
M	MAVERICK	My fault. Should have watched where I was going. watching your six?
M	MAVERICK	Uh, nobody, I guess.
F	CHARLIE	Too bad.
F	CHARLIE	See you around.
M	MAVERICK	Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
F	CHARLIE	I'm with someone.
M	MAVERICK	I thought he'd never leave.
F	CHARLIE	Yeow!
F	CHARLIE	You! What are you doing here?
M	MAVERICK	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
F	CHARLIE	What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
M	MAVERICK	It would have been really embarrassing!
F	CHARLIE	How did you know this was my car?
M	MAVERICK	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
F	CHARLIE	That's all!
M	MAVERICK	And I asked someone.
F	CHARLIE	You think you're pretty smart.
M	MAVERICK	I think I'm in love.
M	MARINE	Can I help you, Ma'am?
F	CHARLIE	I don't know, Corporal. Can you do anything about this lunatic?
M	FLEX	Not so fast...my head.
M	JESTER	Who are you?
M	SUNDOWN	I'm Sundown.
M	JESTER	Yeah, right. You're late.
M	VIPER	And who are you?
M	FLEX	Flex
M	VIPER	Flex...? You don't look like Flex to me. You call that muscle? Doesn't look like muscle. Looks like...Pork.
M	VIPER	What're you laughing at? You're Fungus. SUNDOWN/FUNGUS Fungus!
M	PORK	Don't make an issue of it, it'll stick.
M	VIPER	Now to continue. In this class we will be dealing with F-5's and A4's, as our MiG simulators. Technically the F-5 does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the MiG-21--it also does not bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn as well as the MiG-17 but has significantly better visibility.
M	VIPER	Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's here. Charlie's the most qualified to get into P subs and curves, and VN diagrams.
M	VIPER	Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- not your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has her Ph.D. in astrophysics--she's a civilian contractor so you don't salute her...or anything else. Is that clear?
F	CHARLIE	Hello, I think I have some new data for you...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a Negative G push over. Even below one G, they risk a flame out. Operationally, they will do a zero to one G only. CHARLIE
M	The latest intelligence shows that	the most they will do in operation is one....is there something wrong, Lieutenant.
M	MAVERICK	I don't think you're altogether right...about the MiG, that is.
F	CHARLIE	I beg your pardon.
M	MAVERICK	No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
F	CHARLIE	Why not?
M	MAVERICK	I saw one.
F	CHARLIE	You saw a MiG 21?
M	MAVERICK	I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
F	CHARLIE	Where did you see that?
M	MAVERICK	It's classified.
F	CHARLIE	It's what?
M	MAVERICK	It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
M	VIPER	Maverick!!!
F	CHARLIE	It's all right.
F	CHARLIE	Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
M	MAVERICK	Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
M	MAVERICK	Yes, ma'am.
F	CHARLIE	Where were you?
M	MAVERICK	On his six.
F	CHARLIE	He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
M	MAVERICK	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
F	CHARLIE	If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
M	MAVERICK	I was inverted.
F	CHARLIE	You were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG 21? (She can't believe it.)
M	MAVERICK	Two.
F	CHARLIE	Two miles.
M	MAVERICK	Two meters.
M	GOOSE	One and a half, actually. I got a polaroid.
F	CHARLIE	Lieutenant... MAVERICK Ma'am?
F	CHARLIE	What were you doing there?
M	MAVERICK	Giving him the bird.
F	CHARLIE	The what?
M	MAVERICK	You know. The finger.
F	CHARLIE	So you're the reason those SALT talks failed.
M	VIPER	Lieutenant!
M	GOOSE	It's just like he says, sir.
M	VIPER	I don't care!
M	MAVERICK	Why didn't you tell me you were a TAGREF?
F	CHARLIE	It never came up.
M	MAVERICK	You let me make a fool of myself.
F	CHARLIE	You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter?
M	MAVERICK	Would it have made a difference?
F	CHARLIE	No.
M	MAVERICK	What would?
F	CHARLIE	You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
F	CHARLIE	Why can't you keep this straight?
M	VIPER	Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
M	MAVERICK	Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
M	VIPER	You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir.
M	VIPER	A good man. Good flyer.
M	MAVERICK	Yes sir. Thank you sir.
M	MAVERICK	I've lost him -- where is he?
M	GOOSE	On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
M	GOOSE	Great move. Great
M	MAVERICK	He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
M	MAVERICK	No way. I'll nail him this time. Going vertical.
M	GOOSE	He's blind -- you got him!
M	JESTER	NO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU? I'VE LOST SIGHT.
M	GOOSE	He's out of energy! You got control? Unload!
M	JESTER	WE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S OFF.
M	GOOSE	He's right. We're at ten thousand.
M	MAVERICK	No way. I got you, sucker. You're going down.
M	MAVERICK	In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE SHOT. YOU'RE GONE, JESTER, DEAD! GOOSE Goddamn! We beat him!
M	JESTER	ROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE THE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE IMMEDIATELY.
M	MAVERICK	We did it!
M	GOOSE	Look, Ma, top of the world!
M	GOOSE	Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
M	MAVERICK	Right.
M	GOOSE	Right. Much better. ...Ahhh...what do you call this?
M	MAVERICK	It's a victory roll.
M	GOOSE	I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like...self immolation.
M	GOOSE	Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
M	MAVERICK	Come on, relax...
M	GOOSE	You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
M	MAVERICK	Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
M	GOOSE	Just once, if they take your plane away.
M	ICEMAN	Cowboys!
M	SLIDER	Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose
M	GOOSE	Hey, see any controls back there? And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
M	WOLFMAN	You won?!!!
M	MAVERICK	Didn't everybody?
M	WOLFMAN	No, we...got our butts kicked.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky. that. I say to Hollywood: Where'd he go? Hollywood says: where'd who go?
M	HOLLYWOOD	And he's laughing. Right over the radio, He's laughing at us. GOOSE You won. Congratulations. HOLLYWOOD Maverick and Goose won too.
M	ICE	That's not what I heard.
M	GOOSE	We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his
M	ICE	Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
M	JESTER	Maverick, Goose. Viper's office. Now! 53D. ANGLE ENLISTED (MEN)
M	VIPER	Well....That about covers the flyby.
M	VIPER	Now...in addition...you broke two major rules of engagement. And... That's ...not good.
M	VIPER	Lieutenant Candela lost sight of you, and called "no joy". You failed to respond. VIPER Why? Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His
M	MAVERICK	I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
M	VIPER	Is that how you remember it?
M	GOOSE	Yes, sir. By the time we could respond, we were diving right into his view.
M	VIPER	The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
M	JESTER	Just below ten thousand.
M	VIPER	But you continued to fight.
M	VIPER	Why?
M	MAVERICK	We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
M	VIPER	The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear? we were ...I was... just a little over enthusiastic.
M	VIPER	I guess you were. Dismissed.
M	JESTER	I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
M	VIPER	Tell me one thing.
M	VIPER	...If you had to go into combat, would you want him with you?
M	JESTER	Yep.
M	JESTER	He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
M	VIPER	Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. (laughs) "Maverick!"
M	WOLFMAN	No. No. Look out, you lost it.
M	WOLFMAN	We're dead!
M	GOOSE	Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Come on. I died enough for one night.
M	GOOSE	Have you guys ever considered career counseling?
M	GOOSE	What happened. What did you do in there?
M	GOOSE	What did you do? You broke it! 58. COMPUTER ANALYSIS ROOM
F	CHARLIE	You flew it off the template. Nobody ever did that before.
M	GOOSE	That's what she said last night.
F	CHARLIE	What is it about you?
M	MAVERICK	What would you say, too fast...too quick...
F	CHARLIE	And far too aggressive.
M	MAVERICK	It is combat. Every second counts.
M	The hottest moves in the world	aren't gonna help you if you wind up alone. Your wingman's got to be able to follow you. Trust you. Know that he can depend on you. It's more than just fancy flying.
M	MAVERICK	Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry.
F	CHARLIE	For what?
M	MAVERICK	That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
F	CHARLIE	Apology acknowledged.
M	MAVERICK	Is that all?
F	CHARLIE	What else do you want?
M	MAVERICK	Um. You.
F	CHARLIE	There you go with those moves again.
M	MAVERICK	Too aggressive?
F	CHARLIE	I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
M	MAVERICK	I'm special.
F	CHARLIE	Yes. I'll give you that!
M	MAVERICK	Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
F	CHARLIE	I can't.
M	MAVERICK	I thought there was something... That night in the club...
F	CHARLIE	Lieutenant...
M	MAVERICK	Evan... or Maverick.
F	CHARLIE	Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
M	MAVERICK	The what?
F	CHARLIE	Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
M	MAVERICK	What are you talking about?
F	CHARLIE	You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
M	MAVERICK	I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
M	MAVERICK	Harmless!
F	CHARLIE	Uh hum.
M	MAVERICK	What if he's not?
F	CHARLIE	You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens. harmless before...
F	CHARLIE	And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
M	MAVERICK	Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
F	CHARLIE	How about what?
M	MAVERICK	How about anything, anything you want to do.
F	CHARLIE	Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
M	MAVERICK	A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
F	CHARLIE	What about the plane?
M	MAVERICK	What plane.
F	CHARLIE	Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
F	CHARLIE	Used to what?
M	MAVERICK	I'm different.
F	CHARLIE	I'm starting to sense that now. come around.
M	MAVERICK	Let's make it at eight.
F	CHARLIE	Make what?
M	MAVERICK	Anything.
F	CHARLIE	Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work. 59A. BEACH LA JOLLA - DAY
F	CHARLIE	Why'd you do that?
M	MAVERICK	
M	MAVERICK	It dies. We live.
F	CHARLIE	You're an animal.
M	MAVERICK	That's true. What are you?
F	CHARLIE	I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
F	CHARLIE	No!
M	MAVERICK	It's not suffering anymore.
F	CHARLIE	You're horrible
M	MAVERICK	You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? (he puts it down) Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
F	CHARLIE	You don't have to kill it.
M	MAVERICK	Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
F	CHARLIE	You ever think about killing another human being?
M	MAVERICK	About as much as they think about killing me.
F	CHARLIE	Does it bother you?
M	MAVERICK	They know the rules...(this is too strong for her, she turns away, he comes around to her.) That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. (she draws away) It bothers you, why? You're part of it. (She stiffens, he's losing her. He softens) Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
M	You don't want to confront it, do	you. You want to keep it all clean, cerebral... velocity vectors, wing-load diagrams...You ever been up?
F	CHARLIE	Flying? MAVERICK You use your mind to keep things at a distance. You ever just let go?
M	MAVERICK	You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
F	CHARLIE	You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
M	MAVERICK	That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
F	CHARLIE	Winston Churchill.
F	CHARLIE	What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
M	MAVERICK	All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead... When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
F	CHARLIE	What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss.
M	MAVERICK	There is lots of stuff I don't know about... Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
F	CHARLIE	Are you really that brave?
M	MAVERICK	I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
F	CHARLIE	It's just as I thought.
M	MAVERICK	What?
F	CHARLIE	You're totally insane.
M	MAVERICK	Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?.
M	GOOSE	Come on, we're next.
M	MAVERICK	What?
M	GOOSE	Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
M	GOOSE	Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
M	MAVERICK	I've had enough...for now.
M	MAVERICK	Come on.
F	CHARLIE	Where?
M	MAVERICK	You want to go ballistic?
F	CHARLIE	I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
M	MAVERICK	Stick with me, you'll get used to it.
M	MAVERICK	I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
F	CHARLIE	And now?
M	MAVERICK	And now I want you.
F	CHARLIE	You always get what you want?
M	MAVERICK	I don't know yet.
F	CHARLIE	I want it understood.
M	MAVERICK	Anything.
F	CHARLIE	No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
M	MAVERICK	Why?
F	CHARLIE	I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
M	MAVERICK	Acknowleged.
M	VIPER	The bandit has good position right here. All right, freeze here. The moment of choice -- Maverick is defensive. He has a chance to bug out right here....Better to retire and save your plane than force a bad position. Stay in the diamond another three seconds, the bandit will blow you out of the sky...make a hard right, select zone 5...(turns to Maverick to drive point home) you can extend and escape. You make a bad choice. Roll forward. You perform a split S. That's the last thing you should do. The bandit is right on your tail -- Freeze there...the bandit has you in his gunsight. What were you thinking here, Maverick?
M	MAVERICK	I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
M	VIPER	Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
M	MAVERICK	No guts, no glory. SLIDER Your guts. His glory.
M	VIPER	Unfortunately, the gamble worked, or you might have learned something. The bandit never gets a clean shot...Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the top and defeats the bandit with a missile shot. The encounter was a victory, but we've shown it as an example of what not to do. Ice is next.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Gutsiest move I ever saw.
M	VIPER	And the dumbest...Okay, look at this. It's textbook. Ice takes control of the battle immediately. He never gives the bandit a chance to take the offensive. An early turn here -- excellent. He goes for the jugular, and it's over just that quick. Let's run that again, it's exactly how it should be done.
M	GOOSE	What the hell is this?
M	MAVERICK	Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
M	JESTER	On the run. Let's go. Move it!
M	GOOSE	A fighter pilot's lunch... a hot dog and a puke.
M	HOLLYWOOD	I was a victim of circumstance.
M	GOOSE	They should have warned you about that one.
M	HOLLYWOOD	She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
M	GOOSE	What'd you do?
M	HOLLYWOOD	Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
M	WOLFMAN	It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
M	HOLLYWOOD	That's because you don't have any women.
M	WOLFMAN	Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
M	HOLLYWOOD	The girl with the purple fingernails?
M	WOLFMAN	That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
M	MAVERICK	It was bad.
M	WOLFMAN	Bad?
M	MAVERICK	The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
M	WOLFMAN	I didn't ruin her.
M	MAVERICK	You didn't help.
M	WOLFMAN	No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
M	GOOSE	Seemed not to. But it's hard to know. You never can tell what's in the mind of a psychopath.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Hear about Ice?
M	WOLFMAN	What now?
M	HOLLYWOOD	He won again.
M	GOOSE	Something bothering you?
M	MAVERICK	Nothing. Let's just go fight.
M	MAVERICK	Morning, Coogan.
M	WOLFMAN	How's it goin', Coog?
M	HOLLYWOOD	Ever find your sister, Coogan?
M	COOGAN	You guys know somethin' about that? TWO AT SEVEN O'CLOCK, JESTER. SCRAMBLE.
M	JESTER	ROGER. COMING LEFT.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Holy shit, it's Viper.
M	MAVERICK	Keep your shirt on, he's saying holy shit it's us. MAVERICK STAY WITH HIM, WOOD... YOUR SIX CLEAR!
M	MAVERICK	STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
M	GOOSE	Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
M	VIPER	SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
M	MAVERICK	ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
M	GOOSE	Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
M	MAVERICK	I'm gonna take him, Goose.
M	GOOSE	Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
M	MAVERICK	I want him!
M	GOOSE	Hey, come on--hey!
M	GOOSE	What what are you doing? We're cover!
M	MAVERICK	Wood's okay. I want Viper.
M	GOOSE	But we're cover! Goddamn, rookie, you're all right!
M	MAVERICK	What's the range, Goose. I've got a good tone.
M	GOOSE	Two bogies ! Three o'clock high, nine o'clock high! Break!
M	JESTER	ATOLL ON THE NORTHERN F-14. HE'S OUT OF THE FIGHT..
M	VIPER	WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
M	JESTER	NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
M	GOOSE	THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID!
M	VIPER	KNOCK OFF THE CHATTER, TOP GUNS. LET'S RTB. VIPER HAS THE LEAD. LATER
M	VIPER	Ya know, that was the best flying I've seen since Nam...(He grins) ...Right up to that part where you got killed.
M	VIPER	Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
M	MAVERICK	I lost.
M	VIPER	Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
M	MAVERICK	I can take care of myself.
M	VIPER	Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. (he studies him for a moment) Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
M	MAVERICK	It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
M	VIPER	Then why are you here?
M	MAVERICK	For the same reason you are.
M	VIPER	Oh, you mean the thrill!
M	MAVERICK	The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet.
M	VIPER	It's not a gift, just a loan...
M	VIPER	Nine out of ten is okay, as long as it's only fun and games. But this isn't about that. This is serious business. It is dangerous up there! At 500 knots, things can change a lot in a second. Discipline is what protects us.
M	VIPER	It was a good day. You learned something. You lost and you're still alive to think about it. And, you lost your wingman. That's a cardinal sin...don't ever do it again. You owe Hollywood an apology and you owe me a beer.
M	GOOSE	Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
M	MAVERICK	I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
M	GOOSE	Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
M	GOOSE	...butt...Hi, honey, God, am I glad to see you! I missed you.
F	CAROL	I had to come, Willard, I got so lonesome I just couldn't stand it.
M	GOOSE	Sure, honey, I understand. It's great to see you. Hey where's your backseater, where's the world's smallest RIO..
M	MAVERICK	Food...and you...my F-14!
F	CHARLIE	In that order?
M	MAVERICK	Well no...inverse order.
F	CHARLIE	I'm still second best.
M	MAVERICK	You ever fly an F-14?
F	CHARLIE	I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
M	MAVERICK	Ahhh, you'd love it. Night carrier landings! The most dangerous thing you can think of! ...next to you...And the most exciting. You're living at one hundred and ten per cent. Greatest high in the world...
F	CHARLIE	Danger?
M	MAVERICK	Yeah!
F	CHARLIE	Doesn't it ever bother you?
M	MAVERICK	Why, what's gonna happen?
M	MAVERICK	Lucky charm.
F	CHARLIE	What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
M	MAVERICK	Just good luck.
F	CHARLIE	Where'd you get it.
M	MAVERICK	Pawn shop. What's to eat?
M	VIPER (V.O.)	...MiG sweep over the water. You will proceed down the one-seven -zero degree radial looking for MiGs. You will engage all that you find, destroy them, and return to base. Maverick, has the lead. Any questions? All right, let's go. Move like you've got a purpose.... 20,000 FT. - DAY
M	ICE	ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
M	MAVERICK	SHIT!!
M	ICE	MIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A LEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING.
M	MAVERICK	COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
M	ICE	STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
M	ICE	GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
M	MAVERICK	FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
M	ICE	GET LOST! YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN. IT'S MY SHOT. COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
M	ICE	STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
M	MAVERICK	YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
M	MAVERICK	ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
M	ICE	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
M	MAVERICK	IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
M	ICE	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
M	MAVERICK	COMING IN.
M	ICE	Sonofabitch.
M	ICE	LOOK OUT!
M	GOOSE	Oh, no! They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the
M	GOOSE	Plane's coupling up! Plane's coupling up!
M	GOOSE	We're low!
M	MAVERICK	I'm pinned to the panel.
M	GOOSE	Time to go.
M	MAVERICK	I can't eject.
M	GOOSE	3000 feet. I'll do it.
M	MAVERICK	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
M	GOOSE	
M	MAVERICK	Let's go. Eject.
M	FROGMAN	Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
M	FROGMAN	Sir! Let him go. It's all right. Let him go.
M	VIPER	How do you feel?
M	MAVERICK	All right.
M	VIPER	Goose is dead.
M	MAVERICK	I know. I was there. Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of
M	VIPER	If you fly jets long enough, something like this happens to you. No one escapes it. It touches us all.
M	MAVERICK	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
M	VIPER	My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
M	VIPER	You've got to put him in the box.
F	CHARLIE	...they say you're alright.
M	MAVERICK	I'm fine.
F	CHARLIE	This is it, then.
M	MAVERICK	What?
F	CHARLIE	The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
M	MAVERICK	He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
F	CHARLIE	That's not what I hear.
M	MAVERICK	I was flying...my responsibility.
F	CHARLIE	That's what you get flight pay for.
M	MAVERICK	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
F	CHARLIE	Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
M	MAVERICK	Not to me.
F	CHARLIE	You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
M	MAVERICK	Where are we?
F	CHARLIE	Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
M	MAVERICK	You don't have to do this.
F	CHARLIE	Do what, show you a good time?
M	MAVERICK	I'm not good company. I should be alone.
F	CHARLIE	I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
M	MAVERICK	No.
F	CHARLIE	What do you want?
M	MAVERICK	I want it back.
F	CHARLIE	What?
M	MAVERICK	Yesterday.
F	CHARLIE	You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
M	MAVERICK	That's what I want.
F	CHARLIE	Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
F	CHARLIE	On the beach... It's what they say when Navy men retire...He's "On The Beach". I always liked that. I had a picture...in my head... all these old guys wandering around here, looking out into the past.
M	MAVERICK	If we knew then, what we know now, we might never have come up out of there.
F	CHARLIE	You don't believe that.
M	MAVERICK	Hardly ever.
F	CHARLIE	Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
M	MAVERICK	It does.
F	CHARLIE	Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
F	CHARLIE	This too...shall pass. You put as much life as you can between it and you. You start piling up experience between then and now.
M	MAVERICK	What do you do when you come here?
F	CHARLIE	I sit. I think. I play games.
M	MAVERICK	What kind of games?
F	CHARLIE	I like to play "reality".
M	MAVERICK	How do you play reality.
F	CHARLIE	It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
M	MAVERICK	Strip reality! How do you play that?
F	CHARLIE	It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing. (he laughs again) One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
M	MAVERICK	You're crazy. (She stops, he goes on, softer) That's a pretty silly game.
F	CHARLIE	Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
F	CHARLIE	Want to play the game?
M	MAVERICK	How does it go?
F	CHARLIE	Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
M	MAVERICK	What truth?
F	CHARLIE	The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
M	MAVERICK	Goose is dead.
F	CHARLIE	True.
M	MAVERICK	Now?
F	CHARLIE	Take something off.
M	MAVERICK	Off me or off you?
F	CHARLIE	That's up to you. It's dangerous...what you do.
M	MAVERICK	It was my fault.
F	CHARLIE	You can't bring him back.
M	MAVERICK	It was my fault. He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.
F	CHARLIE	Nope. Already used that.
F	CHARLIE	Your life goes on.
M	MAVERICK	What does it mean?
F	CHARLIE	That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
F	CHARLIE	You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
M	MAVERICK	That's three.
F	CHARLIE	And that's one!
M	MAVERICK	One more.
F	CHARLIE	Your watch.
M	MAVERICK	You owe me one.
F	CHARLIE	Looks like a tie.
M	MAVERICK	Who's gonna win?
F	CHARLIE	We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
M	BOTHTOGETHER	I love.ove y.you. conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
M	Maverick's	eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding
M	CDR.	The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. Evan Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of twenty-nine July.
M	CDR.	Lt. Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident.
M	CDR.	Lt. Mitchell is restored to flight status without further delay. These proceedings are closed.
M	FUNGUS	BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE GOT THE ANGLE -- PIECE OF CAKE.
M	FUNGUS	ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME.
M	FUNGUS	WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
M	MAVERICK	DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
M	FUNGUS	WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
M	MAVERICK	NO. NO GOOD.
M	JESTER	He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
M	VIPER	It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
M	JESTER	I've seen this before.
M	VIPER	
M	JESTER	Some guys never get it back.
M	FUNGUS	What are you doing?
M	MAVERICK	Saving them some paperwork.
M	FUNGUS	Since when did you care about paperwork?
M	FUNGUS	If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
M	MAVERICK	Not anymore.
M	FUNGUS	So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
F	CHARLIE	Never liked fighter pilots anyway.
M	MAVERICK	You came to the right place.
F	CHARLIE	I'll have what he's having... Hemlock, is it?
F	CHARLIE	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
M	MAVERICK	I was, later.
F	CHARLIE	Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
M	MAVERICK	I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
F	CHARLIE	I know exactly what you mean.
M	MAVERICK	How could you?
F	CHARLIE	I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
M	MAVERICK	...Something like that.
F	CHARLIE	And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
M	MAVERICK	Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
F	CHARLIE	Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
M	MAVERICK	I hope you find him.
F	CHARLIE	I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
F	CHARLIE	So long, Sailor. See you on the beach sometime.
M	TIM	Dad...Of all the aminals in the ocean, which one's the baddest?
M	VIPER	I don't know, Tim. You'll have to ask them.
M	VIPER	Runs in the family...
M	MAVERICK	Skipper, sorry to bother you.
M	VIPER	No bother.
M	MAVERICK	I called your house.
M	VIPER	My wife's house.
M	MAVERICK	She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the What about me?
M	VIPER	We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
M	MAVERICK	Or....
M	VIPER	Or you can quit.
M	MAVERICK	I don't know...
M	VIPER	I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
M	MAVERICK	You've already made up your mind.
M	VIPER	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
M	MAVERICK	You think I should quit?!
M	VIPER	I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you. The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
M	MAVERICK	Here, let me get this. We'll be even.
M	MAVERICK	Lucky charm.
M	VIPER	Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
M	MAVERICK	I know.
M	VIPER	VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
M	MAVERICK	I'm nothing like him.
M	VIPER	You may not think so, but you are.
M	MAVERICK	He was by the book, all the way.
M	VIPER	They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
M	MAVERICK	I never heard that.
M	VIPER	Not something they tell dependents.
M	MAVERICK	It's not true.
M	VIPER	Why would I lie?
M	VIPER	You start on a wrong heading... the more you stick to it, the further you get from your target. A good pilot always questions himself, always questions his judgments, stays alert for drift and makes the corrections...You may find a little discipline helps with the fear. You don't have to be alone up there.
M	MAVERICK	How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
M	VIPER	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
M	MAVERICK	You think I shouldn't fly.
M	VIPER	I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
M	MAVERICK	Would you take me back? Would they?
M	VIPER	I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
M	FUNGUS	I don't know where he is...
M	PORK	What are his plans?
M	FUNGUS	I don't know.
M	FUNGUS	I'm glad.
M	WOLFMAN	Good to see you, man.
M	VIPER	Gentlemen, you know how I hate to break up this party before it has a chance to get really out of hand... ...but there's a major flap on.
M	HOLLYWOOD	We're being called back?
M	VIPER	You're on your way. Don't bother going to BOQ. Your bags are packed. EYES ...Navy oceanographic ship... international waters... fired upon... unknown forces...
M	STINGER	...by unknown forces...by Migs. We don't know who they are. All I know is that it's our ship, and our orders are to escort it out of the area.
M	STINGER (V.O.)	This is "Bullseye". A rescue operation is to begin within the hour. Your mission is to give air support to that rescue. There are MiGs in the area, and tensions are high. If you witness a hostile act you will return fire. We will be covering 360 degrees of the compass by section. Be prepared for anything.
M	SLIDER	Ice and Hollywood, sector two.
M	SLIDER	And Maverick. You'll back them up, on Ready Five.
M	MAVERICK	Yessir.

M	HOLLYWOOD	GOT 'EM.
M	HOLLYWOOD	TWO MORE -- TWO MORE CONTACTS. 2-7-0 at 10 MILES. WE NEED SOME HELP HERE, MUSTANG.

M	FUNGUS	Now have you got it? Have you still got it?
M	MAVERICK	Yawing right.

M	MAVERICK	Okay.
M	FUNGUS	4500. Critical point.
M	MAVERICK	No! Not again!
M	FUNGUS	What are you talking about, we gotta go!
M	MAVERICK	I'm not losing it again!
M	FUNGUS	Gotta go, man.
M	MAVERICK	280, 290, 300 knots.
M	FUNGUS	3,000 feet. We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!

M	FUNGUS	What in the Christ...was that?
M	FUNGUS	Did you plan that? Was all that something you planned?
M	MAVERICK	ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST.
M	FUNGUS	Because...if that was... Next time you tell me first.
M	ICE	ROG.
M	MAVERICK	I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
M	ICE	I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
M	MAVERICK	I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.

M	MAVERICK	WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
M	MAVERICK	HE FIRED, BREAK NOW!
M	MAVERICK	He's out! We got him!
M	FUNGUS	What a dope! Maybe they'll give him another plane...and we can shoot him down again.
M	FUNGUS	What is it? What's wrong?
M	FUNGUS	Is there something I should know?
M	MAVERICK	Just relax.
M	FUNGUS	Is it the plane?
M	MAVERICK	The plane is fine.
M	FUNGUS	Is it you?
M	MAVERICK	Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
M	MAVERICK	HELLO MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FOR STINGER.
M	STRIKE	ROGER, MAVERICK. GO AHEAD.
M	MAVERICK	TELL STINGER MAVERICK HAS GOOD NEWS AND SOME BAD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ICE GOT A MIG. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT MAVERICK GOT TWO!
M	MAVERICK	I GOTTA HAVE ONE.
M	SLIDER	We're low on fuel, Ice.
M	ICE	I know. I know....Aw hell, let's do it!
M	FUNGUS	You're not supposed to...
M	MAVERICK	But I have to!
M	FUNGUS	Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
M	MAVERICK	MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
M	AIR BOSS	NEGATIVE, GHOST RIDER, THE PATTERN'S FULL. MUSTANG, THIS IS GHOST RIDER. REQUEST A FLYBY FOR TWO.
M	OFFICER	Who is that guy?
M	ADMIRAL	Mitchell...
M	XO	...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of 300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. One time, he came over the deck at two hundred, shakes the shit out of the bridge. Lifted Johnson right off his feet.
M	MAVERICK	BOSS, YOU BETTER CLEAR IT OUT, AND WE'RE DOING IT! TEN MILES ASTERN, BOSS. HOW ABOUT IT? The Air Boss is livid. He clenches the mike.
M	AIR BOSS	MUSTANG TO GHOST RIDER!...
M	ADMIRAL	Johnson!
M	AIR BOSS	Yes, Sir, Admiral?
M	ADMIRAL	Give him his flyby.
M	AIR BOSS	ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR. KITTY HAWK DAY
M	AIR BOSS	Goddamn that guy!"
M	ICE	I guess I owe you one.
M	MAVERICK	You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
M	ICE	You saved our lives. You did it!
M	MAVERICK	We did it.
M	ICE	You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time.
M	MAVERICK	No. You can be mine!
M	ICE	Whatever you say, Commander.
M	FUNGUS	What happened to you?
M	WOLFMAN	He got our radio, and an engine. We were lucky to make it back.
M	HOLLYWOOD	Not luck. Skill.
M	STINGER	MiG killers! You name it, boy. Sky's the limit. You name it. A medal. Anything you want. Anything.
M	ICE	MiG killers! What else is there?
M	FUNGUS	You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
M	MAVERICK	Well what?
M	FUNGUS	What do you want?
M	MAVERICK	What do I want?
M	FUNGUS	What do you want?
M	MAVERICK	Any more MiGs?
M	STINGER	They don't seem to want to come up anymore. There's nothing on the scopes. In fact, everybody's denying the incident ever happened. So...what is it? What do you want? ENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....
M	JESTER	Who's the hell is that?
M	VIPER	Three guesses.
M	JESTER	Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
M	VIPER	Come on.
M	FUNGUS	I think they know we're here.
M	MAVERICK	Let me do the talking.
M	FUNGUS	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
M	FUNGUS	Why Admiral....How really good it is to see you!
M	A VOICE	Who's in charge here?
M	MAVERICK	I am.
F	CHARLIE	Not for long, you keep that up.
F	CHARLIE	Well?
M	MAVERICK	Well what?
F	CHARLIE	You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
M	MAVERICK	Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
F	CHARLIE	I live here, remember?
M	MAVERICK	Right on the flight line?
F	CHARLIE	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
M	MAVERICK	Maybe your somewhere's with me...
M	MAVERICK	That's okay. I always look forward to a challenge. Hollywood
