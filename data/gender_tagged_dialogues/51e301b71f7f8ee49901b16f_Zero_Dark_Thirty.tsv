M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	DANIEL	I own you, Ammar. You belong to me. Look at me. This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	If you don't look at me when I talk to you, I hurt you. If you step off this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look at me. His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Look at me, Ammar. Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take
M	DANIEL	Are we gonna board up these windows or what? Just off the plane from Washington, you're rocking your best suit for your first interrogation, and then you get this guy. It's not always this intense.
F	MAYA	I'm fine. She's not.
M	DANIEL	Just so you know, it's going to take awhile. He has to learn how helpless he is. Let's get a coffee.
F	MAYA	No, we should go back in. Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes
M	DANIEL	You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor. She shakes her head.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Alright. At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	You might want to put this on.
F	MAYA	You're not wearing one. Is he ever getting out?
M	DANIEL	Never.
M	DANIEL	Right now, this is about you coming to terms with your situation. It's you and me, bro. I want you to understand that I know you, that I've been studying you for a very long time. I could have had you killed Karachi. But I let you live so you and I could talk. You beat me when my hands are tied. I won't talk to you.
M	DANIEL	Life isn't always fair, my friend. Did you really think that when we got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?
M	AMMAR	You're a mid-level guy. You're a garbage man in a corporation. Why should I respect you?
M	DANIEL	And you're a money man. A paperboy! Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	A disgrace to humanity!
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	You and your uncle murdered three thousand innocent people. I have your name on a five-thousand dollar transfer via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker. He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	And you got popped with 150 kilograms of high explosives in your house!
M	AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME?!	
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	I'm just fucking with you. Beat. He laughs again. I don't want to talk about 9/11. What I want to focus on is the Saudi group. Daniel shows him a photo.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri. And I know this dude is up to some serious shit, and what I want from you is his Saudi email. Feel free to jump in. Ammar, bro, I know that you know this dude, just give me his email...and I will give you a blanket. I will give you a blanket and some solid food. No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	I know that you know him.
M	AMMAR	I told you before, I won't talk to you.
M	DANIEL	Have it your way. Let's go. It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes Grab the bucket. Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room,
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Put some water in it. She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	C'mon, let's go. The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef, you guys met in Tunisia back in the 70s.
M	AMMAR	I don't know, you asshole. Maya shakes her head "no."
F	MAYA	That's not credible. Why are you doing this to me?
M	DANIEL	You're a terrorist, that's why I'm doing it to you.
M	AMMAR	Fuck you. Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose.
M	DANIEL	I want emails of the rest of the Saudi group. Give me emails of the rest of the Saudi group! Give me one email, and I will stop this! Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Who's in the Saudi group, and what's the target? Where was the last time you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE
M	LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN?	Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth:
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	This is what defeat looks like, bro. Your jihad is over. Daniel stands.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Get him up. The guards bring Ammar to his feet.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Try to understand the concept here. I have time, you don't. I have other things to do, you don't. It's cool that you're strong. I respect it, I do. But in the end, everybody breaks, bro. It's biology. Dan and Maya exit. They've learned nothing. A colorful, dusty city. Busy markets. Poor children. Dense Meanwhile, across town: Maya drives through the checkpoint and up to the main gate.
M	BRADLEY	How did it go the other night?
M	DANIEL	It was good. The local cops need tactical help. But he's Tier fucking One, baby. There's your money maker.
M	BRADLEY	This is the guy that's KSM's nephew? What's his issue?
M	DANIEL	He's being a dick.
M	BRADLEY	If he's trying to outsmart you, tell him about your PhD.
M	DANIEL	I am going to have to turn up the heat. He needs to give us the Saudi group now. They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the
M	BRADLEY	He's gotta have that - given the family ties. Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss.
M	DANIEL	Tight with his uncle, prints all over the 9/11 money. Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Was I lying or what? The guard opens the door and Maya comes through - not many Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our illustrious station chief. Joe and I did Iraq together.
M	BRADLEY	And we continue our Christian mission here. Nice to meet you.
F	MAYA	You too, Sir.
M	BRADLEY	How was your flight? They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing.
F	MAYA	Fine.
M	DANIEL	She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right?
M	BRADLEY	How do you like Pakistan so far?
F	MAYA	It's kinda fucked up.
M	BRADLEY	You volunteered for this didn't you?
F	MAYA	No. Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer. Third floor, northeast corner. She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away.
M	DANIEL	Don't you think she's a little young for the hard stuff?
M	BRADLEY	Washington says she's a killer.
M	DANIEL	The children's crusade.
M	BRADLEY	They want the next generation on the field. Listen, I have a meeting with ISI in twenty minutes.
M	DANIEL	They're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that.
M	BRADLEY	Did you see the cable from London?
M	DANIEL	Dude, I've been in a dark room with another man for the last two days. We will get to know: JACK, mid-40s, a scruffy teddy bear, the liaison from the JESSICA, 30s, an experienced targeter, and the only woman in
M	JACK	Some dude tells the Malaysian station that his nephew works with a guy who knows a guy--
F	JESSICA	Here we go.
M	JACK	Hold on - He goes to a big feast in Bangkok about a year ago. The guest of honor? Usama bin Laden. Laughter in the room.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	So I say, was Tupac there too?
F	JESSICA	Right, but you forgot - you forgot Mullah Omar. J.J. and JEREMY, two case officers, continue the banter: This is worth 5 million bucks.
M	J.J.	You know we're going to have to chase it down.
M	JEREMY	That's me, man. No job too small.
M	JACK	That's why I have a gift for you, my friend. Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter,
M	DANIEL	Everyone, this is Maya. Maya, everyone. Please don't ask how it's going with Ammar because she's not going to fucking tell you.
F	JESSICA	Ammar is withholding? Daniel nods.
M	JESSICA (CONT'D)	Washington assesses that Abu Faraj is officially our new number three - JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions
M	DANIEL	- Best man for it.
M	JACK (O.S.)	London station is already asking if we think he's in contact with anyone in the U.K.
M	JEREMY	Like we're just keeping it from them. Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.
F	JESSICA	The Jordanians are being really helpful with Ammar's transit papers. Jessica passes Daniel a file.
M	DANIEL	Any imminent threats in here?
F	JESSICA	They want the Consulate, the Marriott, it's low security. And they've got Majid Kahn talking about gas stations in the US.
M	DANIEL	And that's a conversation? Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely
F	JESSICA	Honestly? There are six hundred questions in there. I'd concentrate on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it matter what Faraj thinks about Heathrow? How much latitude does he get to pick targets?
M	DANIEL	I think he'll give up the Saudis. But Heathrow is gonna be tough. Anyway. Anything from last night?
M	J.J.	Quetta base thinks they have a bead on the Arabs that escaped, and they're going to meet with the ISI this afternoon, hopefully to set up a raid down there.
M	DANIEL	Great.
M	JEREMY	And Lahore reporting ISI down there was painfully slow last night. Again. I'm beginning to think it's not incompetence.
M	DANIEL	I agree, I spoke to the Chief about that. Anything on bin Laden?
F	JESSICA	A farmer on the Afghan border near Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped pattern in the hills, tall male in the center of the diamond, flanked by four guards. It's consistent with UBL's movements.
M	JEREMY	That's supposed to be his royal guard?
F	MAYA	That's pre-9/11 behavior. Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge. We don't have reason to believe he's changed security tactics.
F	MAYA	We invaded Afghanistan. That's a reason. And so the rivalry begins.
M	J.J.	Hey, boss, I got a guy for five thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi stand and snoop around a bit.
M	DANIEL	No, don't need him, the diamond sighting is bullshit. See if the Paks will send someone to talk to the farmer. Anything else? We need to be putting runs on the board against Faraj. Speak to the case officers who didn't see fit to make it today. And thank them.
M	DANIEL	Let's take it easy today, huh? Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of Hungry? The food in here sucks so I got you some of this. Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking about him. The guy gets a bomb in his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable. You know him, don't you? Slowly, Ammar nods.
M	AMMAR	Yes.
M	DANIEL	I'm glad you said that. I have an email from you to him. I've had all your coms for years, bro. Who else is in your Saudi group?
M	AMMAR	I just handed out some cash for them. I didn't know who the guys were.
M	DANIEL	When you lie to me, I hurt you.
M	AMMAR	Please.
M	DANIEL	I believe you. I do, I believe you. Beat. Do you want the water again, or do you want something else?
M	AMMAR	Please.
M	DANIEL	Just give me a name. Daniel jumps up. I don't know. Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked
M	DANIEL	You see how this works? You don't mind if my female colleague sees your junk, do you? Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Dude, you shit your pants. Daniel turns to Maya - You stay here, I'll be back. Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his
M	AMMAR	Your friend is an animal. Please, help me. Please. A long beat.
F	MAYA	You can help yourself by being truthful. The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel
M	DANIEL	This is a dog collar. Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	You determine how I treat you. Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	I'm going to walk you. Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner What the fuck do you think is going on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told me that you know. At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	This box sucks. I'm going to put you in it. Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out. When is the attack? Sunday.
M	DANIEL	Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday or next Sunday? Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.
M	AMMAR	Monday.
M	DANIEL	Is it Sunday or Monday? Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Which day is it? Partial information is treated as a lie.
M	AMMAR	Saturday. Beat. The masked men open the box.
M	AMMAR (CONT'D)	Sunday! The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb. He
M	AMMAR (CONT'D)	Monday!
M	DANIEL	Ammar, which day? Monday, Tuesday, Beat.
M	AMMAR (CONT'D)	Thursday. Beat.
M	AMMAR (CONT'D)	Friday. Daniel slams the box shut. Once again, he's learned nothing. The weapon, carried by a BEARDED ARAB MAN dressed in street - The CRACK of the shots sends the rest of the residents Don't worry about the Saudis, they'll take care of business.
M	DANIEL	Yeah, now.
F	JESSICA	You warned them - they didn't take you seriously - this is what happens. It's not on you.
M	DANIEL	Who said that? Zied? Fuck him. This is on me. Ammar is on me!! And it's on her!! We can't let this be a win-win for
F	JESSICA	No, no, no. You had - what - days - brief custody - and an unresponsive ally. The way you do this is you look ahead. London. Heathrow. Mass casualties. That plan is still active.
F	MAYA	Ammar doesn't have a clue about what happened.
F	JESSICA	He knows.
F	MAYA	How?
F	JESSICA	You have to be really careful with people in KSM's circle - they're devious.
F	MAYA	He's not going to talk about attacks on the homeland. He's going to withhold operational details on the KSM network and probably on bin Laden. But he's been in complete isolation, he doesn't know we failed. We can tell him anything.
M	DANIEL	Bluff him?
F	MAYA	He hasn't slept, Dan. He's clueless. You don't remember, do you? You - me: same same. Bad memory. While GUARDS move in the deep b.g., Daniel and Maya are seated
M	DANIEL (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)	Short term memory loss is a side effect of sleep deprivation. It should come back to you. The Guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood: I don't know. How can I remember?
F	MAYA	After we kept you awake for 96 hours, you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people.
M	DANIEL	Which is the smart thing to do, you're starting to think for yourself. Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Eat up! You earned it. Ammar eats.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	So you flew via Amman to Kabul to hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar.
M	AMMAR	How did you know that?
M	DANIEL	I told you man, I know you. Alright, you got me - flight manifests. It must've been pretty fucked up for you guys after 9/11. What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh?
M	AMMAR	After 9/11 I had to choose: fight, to protect our turf - or run. You chose to fight. Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes.
M	AMMAR	I wanted to kill Americans. We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high. We couldn't cross.
F	MAYA	Sorry, who is the "we" in that sentence?
M	AMMAR	Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time. I can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling?
M	AMMAR	Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and Abu Ahmed. Maya makes notes on her pad.
F	MAYA	Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the other guys.
M	AMMAR	He was a computer guy with us at the time. After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North, I think, to Kunar.
F	MAYA	What's his family name?
M	AMMAR	Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.
F	MAYA	Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed", it's a kunya. Ammar, I know the difference between a war name and an Arabic name.
M	DANIEL	She got you there, dude.
M	AMMAR	I swear to you both: I don't know his family name. I would have never asked him something like that. It's not how my uncle worked. My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden. I did see him, once, about a year ago, in Karachi. He read us all a letter from the Sheikh.
F	MAYA	A letter?
M	DANIEL	What did it say? Daniel offers Ammar a smoke.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	Cigarette? Ammar accepts. Daniel's lights it.
M	AMMAR	It said "Continue the jihad. The work will go on for a hundred years."
M	SOLDIER INTERROGATOR	You and I are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps, yeah? The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed.
M	PRISONER	Ok.
M	SOLDIER INTERROGATOR	Some of these brothers have done some bad things, and what I want to do is I want to separate them from the people like you.
M	PRISONER	Definitely, yeah.
M	SOLDIER INTERROGATOR	There was a guy called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait.
M	PRISONER	Yes, I remember him. A nice guy.
M	SOLDIER INTERROGATOR	How close was he? What was his relationship to the leadership?
M	PRISONER	I don't know.
M	SOLDIER INTERROGATOR	Did he eat with you guys - did he eat with the good guys - or did he eat with the leadership?
M	PRISONER	I don't know, sir. I have no idea about things like that.
M	SOLDIER INTERROGATOR	Yes you do, you don't need an idea Maya hits pause and we see that her desk is filled with open
M	TURKISH INTERROGATOR	When you met with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was this one of the facilitators? The Interrogator flashes a picture. The prisoner moans.
M	TURKISH INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)	Is this Abu Ahmed?
M	PRISONER	Yes.
M	INTERROGATOR	KSM, your boss.
M	PRISONER	Mukhtar?
M	INTERROGATOR	Mukhtar,'potato', you say 'potahto'. I say 'fucking KSM', but yeah, 'Mukhtar.' After Mukhtar was captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?
M	PRISONER	Abu Ahmed, I believe he went to work for The Sheikh. CU SCREEN: a different INTERROGATOR from the previous video;
M	PRISONER	In Karachi, in 2003 or 2004.
M	INTERROGATOR	He was carrying a letter from bin Laden?
M	INTERROGATOR	Is that him? Abu Ahmed. The interrogator holds The Photograph right in front of the
M	INTERROGATOR	Say again?
M	PRISONER	Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed. Freeze frame.
M	INTERROGATOR	Abu Ahmed - is he the courier for bin Laden?
M	PRISONER	Who knows who works directly for bin Laden? Let's say he's part of the mix.
M	INTERROGATOR	Were there other people who carried messages from bin Laden?
M	PRISONER	Sure.
M	INTERROGATOR	How many other people? Four or five.
M	INTERROGATOR	Let's talk about them-- The image freezes. Maya stares at the screen.
F	JESSICA	How's the needle in the haystack?
F	MAYA	Fine.
F	JESSICA	Facilitators come and go, but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money. The rivalry is in full bloom. Sometimes it's friendly. You're assuming that Al Qaeda members are motivated by financial rewards. They're radicals. Correct. You're assuming that greed won't override ideology in some of the weaker members.
F	MAYA	Money for walk-ins worked great in the cold war, I'll give you that.
F	JESSICA	Thank you.
F	MAYA	Just not sure those tactics are applicable to the Middle East. She enters a vast cavernous hold accompanied by a middle He says he looks like Abu Ahmed.
F	MAYA	Who did he work for? Hakim translates. Then the prisoner speaks. It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they were always together.
F	MAYA	What did he do for Faraj? He carried messages from Faraj to bin Laden and from bin Laden back to Faraj. Maya leans into Hakim - We need to ask him something to see if he's telling the truth. We don't know if he really knew Faraj. Hakim speaks to the prisoner.
M	HAKIM	He just told me the names of all of Faraj's children. I think he's telling the truth. Maya stands.
F	MAYA	Twenty detainees recognize that photo of Abu Ahmed. They say he's part of the inner circle of guys who were hanging out in Afghanistan pre-9/11. A lot of them say that after 9/11, he went to work for KSM. When KSM got captured, he went to work for Abu Faraj, primarily as a courier from Faraj to bin Laden.
M	BRADLEY	Well, that's good. You still-
F	MAYA	Yeah, we don't know if Abu is on the outside of the network - part of a series of cutouts and dead drops - or if he has a direct connection to bin Laden. Does bin Laden invite him into the living room and hand him a letter directly? Or is Abu just the last guy in a long line of couriers, so that's why everybody knows him?
M	BRADLEY	That's not all you don't know. You don't have his true name, and you don't have a clue of where he is.
F	MAYA	We know that he's important. The fact that everybody's heard of Abu Ahmed but nobody will tell me where he is suggests that.
M	BRADLEY	Maybe. Detainees could withhold his location for any number of reasons. Perhaps they don't know; perhaps this Abu is just a cover story and he's really a fucking unicorn. The withholding doesn't reveal what you want it to - does it?
F	MAYA	No.
M	BRADLEY	And if you did find him, you don't know that he'd be with bin Laden.
M	DANIEL	We don't know what we don't know. What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
M	DANIEL	It's a tautology.
M	BRADLEY	Listen, not one single detainee has said that he's located with the big guy, just that he delivers messages. Am I wrong?
F	MAYA	No.
M	BRADLEY	No. It's still good work.
M	BRADLEY (CONT'D)	Let me know when you've got some actionable intelligence, preferably something that leads to a strike. Passengers inside the bus read newspapers, listen to music... Then, the bus explodes! File footage of the aftermath: This is what remains of the #10 bus, which was traveling through Tavistock Square... Joseph Bradley sits at his desk. The weight of the world on On the television in the background, the news report
M	REPORTER (O.S.)	All around, groups of Londoners are standing on corners asking themselves
M	REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)	what has happened here, and who could possibly have done this? We find Daniel trying to catch a moment of solitude...eating The monkeys are watching Daniel intently, their hands gripping A CIA GUARD approaches Daniel
M	CIA GUARD	You Agency guys are twisted. The detainee is ready. Daniel nods, weary. Then a monkey reaches through the bars
M	MAYA (PRE-LAP)	I want you to understand that I know you. I have been following you and studying you for a long time. I chased you in Lahore. We find Maya entering the gates of a Pakistani prison. The
F	MAYA	I had you picked up instead of killing you because you're not a violent man and you don't deserve to die.
M	GHUL	Thank you.
F	MAYA	But you do have deep ties to Al Qaeda that I want to ask you about before you get sent to your next location, which might be Israel. Ghul looks ashen.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	However, depending on how candid you are today, I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.
M	GHUL	What do you want to know?
F	MAYA	I'm going to ask you a series of questions based on your knowledge of Al Qaeda and your position as key financier for the organization.
M	GHUL	I have dealt with the mukhabarat, I have no wish to be tortured again. Ask me a question, I can answer it.
F	MAYA	What can you tell me about Atiyah Abd al-Rahman.
M	GHUL	He works for Zawahiri. He's in charge of military tactics.
F	MAYA	In what context have you ever heard the name Abu Ahmed?
M	GHUL	He works for Faraj and bin Laden. He is his most trusted courier. Maya works hard to hide how pleased she is to have this
F	MAYA	What makes you say that?
M	GHUL	He brought me many messages from the Sheikh.
F	MAYA	Where did you last see him, and where is he now?
M	GHUL	You will never find him.
F	MAYA	Why is that?
M	GHUL	Even I couldn't find him. He always contacted me out of the blue. He is one of the disappeared ones. You know how this works? The man is terrified.
M	PAKISTANI POLICEMAN (CONT'D)	Just act naturally. The Policeman finishes securing the bomb, and sends the man After a moment, ABU FARAJ, who we recognize from his CHILDREN playing. Several people in BLACK BURKHAS.
M	BRIGHT SUN.	At last Faraj reaches an open area where he can see his They exchange a nervous glance that conveys the danger: It's
M	DANIEL	What do you like? Bob Marley? Reggae? Egyptian music? Just let me know, if there's music you like, I can make a call.
M	DANIEL	Can I be honest with you? I'm bad news. I'm not your friend. I'm not gonna help you. I'm gonna break you. Beat.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	I've done it before. Hey, wake up. You haven't eaten in 18 hours, we've got to keep your energy up. You hungry?
M	BRADLEY	You're in luck, I got you a one-on- one with Faraj.
F	MAYA	Seriously? Thank you.
M	BRADLEY	Don't thank me until you hear what I want for it. He drops a folder on her desk.
M	BRADLEY (CONT'D)	I want you to take care of all of this before your favorite subject.
F	MAYA	Deal.
M	BRADLEY	Don't you want to see what's in the folder?
F	MAYA	You want family ties, financial networks, media sources, disgruntled employees, imminent threats, homeland plots, Thank you.
F	MAYA	Foreign cells, health status, trade craft, recruiting tactics -- anything else?
F	MAYA	A lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed was bin Laden's courier and that he worked very closely with you.
M	FARAJ	You're thinking of Abu Khalid.
F	MAYA	Who?
M	FARAJ	Al Buluchi. My courier for the Sheikh.
F	MAYA	Okay, so you're telling me that all the other brothers are wrong, and there's some famous Buluchi guy that is working for you and bin Laden that I've never even heard of?
M	FARAJ	Why should you have heard of him?
F	MAYA	What does this Buluchi guy look like?
M	FARAJ	Tall, long white beard, thin. He uses a cane.
F	MAYA	Kind of like Gandolf?
M	FARAJ	Who?
F	MAYA	When was the last time you saw him?
M	FARAJ	A month ago, in Karachi, but I don't know where he is now. Sometimes I wouldn't even see him, he would just tell me where to leave the messages.
F	MAYA	I don't believe you. The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	You're not being fulsome in your replies.
M	FARAJ	You can't force me to tell you something I don't know.
F	MAYA	You do realize this is not a normal prison. You determine how you are treated, and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information I need. The guard slaps Faraj again. Faraj is impassive.
F	MAYA	Faraj is completely denying knowing Abu Ahmed, and that's using every measure we have.
M	DANIEL	He's either going to withhold or die from the pressure you're putting on him.
F	MAYA	Do you want to take a run at him?
M	DANIEL	No.
F	MAYA	No? Since when?
M	DANIEL	You know, I've been meaning to tell you: I'm getting outta here.
F	MAYA	What? You okay?
M	DANIEL	I'm fine. I've just seen too many guys naked. It's gotta be over a hundred at this point. I need to go do something normal for awhile.
F	MAYA	Like what?
M	DANIEL	Go to Washington, do the dance, see how that environment works. You should come with me. Be my number two. You're looking a little strung out yourself. Maya looks at Dan. No longer the man he once was. She
F	MAYA	I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from
M	D.C.	They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony.
M	DANIEL	They killed my monkeys. Something about an escape. Can you fucking believe that?
F	MAYA	Sorry, Dan.
M	DANIEL	Look, Maya, you gotta be really careful with detainees now. The politics are changing and you don't want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes.
F	MAYA	I know.
M	DANIEL	And watch your back when you get back to Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now.
M	POLICEMAN	Where are you going?
F	MAYA	To the Marriott. I assume you noticed the dip plates.
M	POLICEMAN	But you have a bag - The policeman motions to a DUFFEL BAG resting on the rear
F	MAYA	It's a gym bag. Maya does not get out of the car. She stares at him The policeman walks away to rejoin his group. The police Maya walks in, flustered.
F	MAYA	Fucking checkpoints. Maya sits down, absorbed in her Blackberry.
F	JESSICA	Maya?
F	MAYA	Yeah.
F	JESSICA	We're socializing. Be social. Maya puts away her blackberry. Okay.
F	JESSICA	Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby, but it's time to cut the umbilical cord.
F	MAYA	No, it's not.
F	JESSICA	So Faraj went south on you - it happens. There are still cells in London and Spain planning the next round of attacks.
F	MAYA	I can work on it at the same time - plus I think it's a good thing that he lied.
F	JESSICA	No, not at the expense of protecting the homeland, you can't. Wait a minute, why is it a good thing?
F	MAYA	You sound just like Bradley. He doesn't believe in my lead either. It's a good thing because the fact that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is revealing. The only other thing he lied about was the location of bin Laden himself. That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to protect as bin Laden. That confirms my lead.
F	JESSICA	Or it's confirmation bias. We're all just worried about you, okay? Is that okay to say? Maya rubs her eyes, not liking where the conversation is
M	JESSICA (CONT'D)	Where's Jack?
F	MAYA	He's probably stuck in some check- point somewhere.
F	JESSICA	You two hooked up yet?
F	MAYA	Hello, I work with him. I'm not that girl, that fucks. It's unbecoming.
F	JESSICA	So? A little foolin' around wouldn't hurt you. So no boyfriend. Do you have any friends at all? She doesn't. Jessica's phone rings -
M	JESSICA (CONT'D)	It's Jack. Hey - that's okay - As alarms wail, Maya struggles to her feet, grabs Jessica by They find each other's hands and grab tightly. The destroyed Marriott.
M	REPORTER (O.S.)	The blast left a crater 10 meters wide in front of the hotel. The Marriott, one of the most popular destinations for locals and Westerners... We pan across the weathered faces, long beards, and see a
F	JESSICA	The Jords have a mole!
F	MAYA	What? Jessica pops a CD into Maya's computer, loads a file that
F	JESSICA	He made this video to prove his bona fides.
F	MAYA	Shut the fuck up! The camera stops on one man, BALAWI. Humam Khalil al-Balawi, he's a Jordanian doctor. He's really motivated. Maya practically bolts out of her chair. Together, they
F	MAYA	This could be it!
F	JESSICA	This is it.
M	CONTINUOUS	Bradley has just finished watching the video. Maya and
F	JESSICA	He's right there in the inner circle.
M	BRADLEY	I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda?
F	JESSICA	The Jords worked him for a year. Dinners, money. They've convinced him that it's his patriotic duty to turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing it.
M	BRADLEY	Yeah, so the Jords say. You're right. We can't rely on the Jords. We have to evaluate him face to face. He may not be that smart. He may be full of shit - but we have to talk to him to find out.
F	MAYA	The key is to meet him so we can figure out for ourselves what he can actually do.
M	BRADLEY	He really asked for a dialysis machine? You can fill the damn thing with poison.
F	JESSICA	The meeting with Balawi is off. He can't come here to Islamabad.
F	MAYA	Can't or won't?
F	JESSICA	He's not going to travel - security The TV interview with Obama reaches the subject of enhanced Then they continue:
M	JESSICA (CONT'D)	He wants us to go to him. He'll meet in Miram Sha or the tribals.
F	MAYA	He knows we're white. You'll get kidnapped up there. DAVID, an analyst, adds his two cents to the conversation -
M	DAVID	We could do it somewhere else - Germany, or the UK? He's got a clean passport.
F	JESSICA	He's not going to travel out of Al Qaeda territory.
M	DAVID	And you're not going to him.
F	JESSICA	I'm not. Believe me. We're stuck.
M	DAVID	What about Camp Chapman? Afghanistan. That could be safe territory. This may be going overboard, but I baked him a cake!
M	MAYA O.S.	Muslim's don't celebrate with cake.
F	JESSICA	Don't be so literal. Everyone likes cake. It's not too late for you to come, you know. It will be fun.
F	MAYA	I don't want to be a straphangar. It's your show. You were the first to see the potential in this.
M	JESSICA (O.S.)	Come on! We've got lots of wine! The target on Maya's monitor disappears in a puff of smoke.
F	MAYA	Cool. Bring me back a bottle.
M	JESSICA (O.S.)	I will.
F	JESSICA	Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11. To big breaks and the little people that make them happen. Clink.
M	JESSICA (CONT'D)	So far, everything he's said we've cross checked and it's proved legit... and I think the money is persuasive. 25 million dollars?! That buys a new life.
M	JOHN	Do you think he might be exaggerating his access?
F	JESSICA	Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise. In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he could be called in to treat bin Laden. And at that moment, with 25 mil on the table, I think he gives up the Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill him. Jessica turns to her crew, which includes LAUREN, a young
F	JESSICA	So John? When he arrives, I'll set the tone, and then I'll flip it to you - and you'll talk about asset protection.
M	JOHN	Roger that.
F	JESSICA	Then Lauren, I know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks. We'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake, then we'll get to the nitty gritty. Jessica turns to Zied.
M	JESSICA (CONT'D)	Is that order okay, or do you want to introduce everyone?
M	ZIED	I'll introduce you, and you introduce your team. He knows this is a high level meeting.
M	SECURTY GUARD	Quick question: all is taking place inside our main building?
F	JESSICA	Right. And Lauren? Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that. Be concise. The Director is in the loop. And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't update the President.
F	LAUREN	Yeah, I'm on it. They take in the possibilities.
F	JESSICA	Now, I just need to get Balawi's ass down here. Waiting and waiting. No cars approach. The sun beats down.
F	JESSICA	Why are there gate guards there? We talked about this, no one is supposed to be there when my source arrives. You might have spooked him already!
M	SECURTY GUARD	Procedures only work if we follow them every time.
F	JESSICA	This time is different - I'm sorry I can't explain, but it's for a good cause.
M	SECURTY GUARD	Look, I'm responsible for everyone's safety, okay? It's not just about you.
F	JESSICA	I just need them to go away for a minute. You can search him as soon as he gets here. The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio: All stations, go ahead and stand down. Roger.
M	ECU: PHONE TEXT:	He's here. Brb Cool! The car navigates the second set of barriers.
M	Maya types on her computer:	Wassup you talking yet
M	SECURTY GUARD	Okay, he's coming. We're gonna search him when he gets here. Everyone prepares. The car gets closer and closer, a driver Answer when you can.
M	BLACKWATER GUARD	Is he supposed to limp like that?
M	SECURTY GUARD	Take your hand out of your pocket! Hey!
M	BALAWI	Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
M	BLACKWATER GUARD	Get you hand out of your pocket!
M	BALAWI	Allahu Akbar. Jessica's smile fades And Balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket Beat. Maya looks up, concern on her face.
M	JEREMY	You okay? No response. I didn't think this day could get any worse, but bad news from Saudi intelligence. The courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead. It's a detainee video. Maya still fighting to contain her grief, takes the file as CU COMPUTER SCREEN: A PRISONER being interviewed by a CIA
M	PRISONER	He's dead, in Afghanistan, 2001. I buried him with my own hands.
M	INTERROGATOR	Where?
M	PRISONER	Kabul. Maya stares at the screen.
F	MAYA	I don't believe this.
M	JEREMY	Sorry, Maya, I always liked this lead. Jeremy leaves Maya at her computer. She continues to stare at the screen. Her friend Jack approaches - Hey. Sorry, I just got here. What are you gonna do?
F	MAYA	I'm going to smoke everybody involved in this op, and then I'm going to kill bin Laden. Off the darkness in her eyes we - GEORGE WRIGHT, Chief of the Afghanistan Pakistan Department,
M	GEORGE	I want to make something absolutely clear.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	If you thought there was some secret cell somewhere working Al Qaeda, I want you to know that you're wrong. This is it. There's no working group coming to the rescue. He stares at his staff.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	There's nobody else, hidden away on some other floor. There is just us. And we are failing. We're spending billions of dollars. People are dying. We're still no closer to defeating our enemy. They attacked us on land in 98, by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001. They murdered three thousand of our citizens in cold blood, and they've slaughtered our forward deployed. And what the fuck have we done about it? What have we done? We have twenty leadership names and we've only eliminated four of them. Beat. I want targets! Do your fucking jobs, bring me people to kill! Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing
F	DEBBIE	Hi. I painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this. She hands Maya a file.
M	DEBBIE (CONT'D)	It's him. He was one of ten names on a watch list sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed. They told us to watch out for him, apparently they think his whole family and extended family is bad and has ties to KSM. He was picked up for fake papers and a doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan, traveling through Morocco en route to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti. This must be Abu Ahmed.
F	MAYA	Doesn't matter, but I wish I had that five years ago. How come I never saw it before?
F	DEBBIE	Nobody saw it, most likely. There was a lot of white noise after 9/11, countries wanting to help out, we got millions of tips and... Things got lost in the shuffle. Human error. Maya turns her attention back to the WHITE BOARD and as Debbie Anyway I thought you should know about it. I just want to say I've heard a lot about you. You inspired me to come to Pakistan. Maya's eyes narrow. She keeps looking at the WHITE BOARD
M	DEBBIE (CONT'D)	Maybe you'll let me buy you a kabob sometime? Don't eat out. It's too dangerous. Maya stares at the Al Quaeda mugshots - a thought crosses Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed!
M	DANIEL	Fuck. Really? He was in the files this whole time. The family name is Sayeed.
M	DANIEL	Ok, but he's dead. So doesn't that make him a little less interesting to you?
M	MAYA O.S.	He may not be. We now know that Abu Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All the brothers in the family look alike. Three of them went to Afghanistan. Isn't it possible that when the three eldest brothers grew beards in Afghanistan, they started to look alike? I think the one calling himself Abu Ahmed is still alive. The picture we've been using is wrong. It's of his older brother, Habeeb. He's the one that's is dead.
M	DANIEL	Okay, what are you basing this on?
F	MAYA	We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed dying.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	We just have a detainee who buried somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed. But if somebody as important as Abu Ahmed had died, they'd be talking about it online in chat rooms all over the place. Plus, the detainee said that Habeeb died in 2001. We know that Abu Ahmed was alive then, trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar. That means it's probably one of the other brothers that's dead.
M	DANIEL O.S.	In other words, you want it to be true.
F	MAYA	Yes, I fucking want it to be true. Maya slams the desk.
M	DANIEL O.S.	Calm down. Beat.
F	MAYA	I am calm.
M	DANIEL O.S.	State your request.
F	MAYA	Move heaven and earth and bring me this fucking Sayeed family's phone number. A dark (window shades down) executive office, where in the
M	DANIEL	As-Salamu alaykum.
M	WOLF	Alaykum salam.
M	DANIEL	I need a couple hundred thousand. Four max.
M	WOLF	Where you gonna get that?
M	DANIEL	From you.
M	WOLF	You think so?
M	DANIEL	This could crack open the facilitator Maya's been looking for by giving us a phone number. She's your killer, Wolf. You put her on the field. Arabic, then loosely Allah rewards those who strive and fight over those that sit behind a desk. WOLF nods. If the blatant attempt to play on his Muslim
M	WOLF	As you know, Abu Ghraib and Gitmo fucked us. The detainee program is now fly paper. We got senators jumping out of our asses, and the Director is very concerned. They will not stop until they have a body. There it is. The quid pro quo. There's a reason he's called Daniel considers all that he'll go through if he volunteers
M	DANIEL	I ran it. I'll defend it. Daniel and a KUWAITI BUSINESS MAN in a suit are drinking and
M	DANIEL	It's good to be back in Kuwait. It's good to see you again, it's been awhile. The businessman doesn't answer.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	I need a favor.
M	KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN	Why should I help you?
M	DANIEL	Because we're friends.
M	KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN	You say we are friends. How come you only call me when you need help? But when I need something - you are too busy to pick up the phone. I don't think we are friends.
M	DANIEL	Fair enough. How about a V10 Lamborghini? How's that for friendship?
M	DANIEL	The poor fucker had to get out of bed. As-salamu alaykum. Thanks my friend. platforms. While the Kuwaiti businessman peers inside a
M	DANIEL	Is this a Balboni? Fuck me. This is nice. What are you thinking?
M	KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN	I think I'll choose this one. The salesman retreats to a back office.
M	DANIEL	That's a nice choice, my friend. Daniel gives the Kuwaiti a slip of paper.
M	KUWAITI MAN	Who is it?
M	DANIEL	Who do you think? The guy's a terrorist. His mother lives here. I just need her phone number.
M	KUWAITI MAN	There will be no repercussions in Kuwait?
M	DANIEL	Somebody might die at some point in Pakistan. They shake hands. Sound graphs of phone calls fill the screen. We cruise
F	MAYA	Hey, Jack.
M	JACK	You're not gonna like this, he's on the phone, but there's no team to deploy right now.
F	MAYA	Fuck. She dashes out runs down the hall to an Exit sign - bursts
F	MAYA	How come you haven't deployed a team to stay in Rawalpindi?
M	LARRY	For one thing, it's dangerous. For another, the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence.
F	MAYA	That's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response time.
M	LARRY	Still, it wouldn't work.
F	MAYA	Why?
M	LARRY	The guy never stays on the phone long enough.
F	MAYA	You haven't tried.
M	LARRY	Look, I don't have the personnel.
F	MAYA	That's bullshit.
M	LARRY	As it is, my guys don't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan.
F	MAYA	Right, I understand. But I don't really care if your guys get sleep or not. Maya looks at Larry's team sleeping on the couch.
M	LARRY	This guy you're obsessed with, what's his name again?
F	MAYA	Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti is the nom de guerre. His true name, we think, is Ibraheem Sayeed. His family lives in Kuwait.
M	LARRY	Wasn't it, like, eight brothers - and a million cousins - that we know about - anyone could be calling home -
F	MAYA	I know -
M	LARRY	- It's not like he's saying, "Hey mom, it's me, the terrorist."
F	MAYA	Over the course of two months, he's called home from six different pay phones, from two different cities, never using the same phone twice. And when his mother asked him where he was, he lied. He said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception -- implying he was in the Tribals -- but he was in
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	a market in Peshawar. I'm sorry, but that's not normal guy behavior. That's tradecraft.
M	LARRY	Maybe he just doesn't like his mom? Look, if he talks about an operation, or refers to anything remotely fishy, I'll get on him. Okay?
F	MAYA	No. Not okay. Look, Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his hand by talking about ops on the phone: he works for bin Laden. The guys that talk about ops on the phone don't get that job. Larry looks away.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	A lot of my friends have died trying to do this. I believe I was spared so I could finish the job. The girl is a true believer - as pure as they come. CU TV SCREEN: News reports of the attemped NYC bombing.
M	REPORTER (O.S.)	It is in surveillance video and pictures like this of the explosive- laden vehicle just moments before it was parked, that police hope to find the man who wanted so badly last night to leave a body count in Times Square. I really need to talk to you about beefing up our surveillance operation on the caller.
M	BRADLEY	We don't have a surveillance operation on the caller. Someone just tried to blow up Times Square and you're talking to me about some facilitator who some detainee seven years ago said might have been working with Al Qaeda? Maya is practically shaking with zealous rage at her inability
F	MAYA	He's the key to bin Laden.
M	BRADLEY	I don't fucking care about bin Laden. I care about the next attack. You're going to start working on American Al Qaeda cells. Protect the homeland.
F	MAYA	bin Laden is the one who keeps telling them to attack the homeland. If it wasn't for him, Al Qaeda would still be focused on overseas targets. If you really want to protect the homeland, you need to get bin Laden. This guy never met bin Laden. This guy is a free lancer working off the fucking internet. No one has even talked to bin Laden in four years: he's out of the game, he may well even be dead but you know what you're doing? You're chasing a ghost while the whole fucking network grows all around you! For a moment she is silenced by Bradley's reprimand but then
F	MAYA	You just want me to nail some low level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that you can check that box on your resume that says while you were in Pakistan you got a real terrorist. But the truth is you don't understand Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda. Either give me the team I need to follow this lead, or the other thing you're gonna have on your resume is being the first Station Chief to be called before a congressional committee for subverting the efforts to capture or kill bin Laden.
M	BRADLEY	You're fucking out of your mind.
F	MAYA	I need four techs in a safe house in Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe house in Peshawar. Either send them out or send me back to DC and explain to the Director why you did it. Jack approaches.
M	JACK	Fuck the mom, we got the man himself. Jack puts a cell phone down on the counter.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Yesterday your caller bought himself a cell phone. And every time his phone rings - - This phone will ring. Did I hook you up? Maya throws her arms around him.
F	MAYA	I love you!
M	MAYA O.S.	My guess is that he lives close to where he's making the calls, and it makes sense he'd be living in Rawalpindi because there's an Al Jezerra office there.
F	MAYA	It would be convenient for him to drop tapes off if he's sending either from bin Laden or from an intermediary. When he wants to make a call, he leaves the house, walks a few blocks, then switches on the phone. We need to keep canvassing the neighborhood until we find him. Two motorcycles suddenly pull around in front of Larry's van
M	LARRY	We got a shooter! Larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind
M	TECH	We're blocked.
M	HAKIM	Let me talk to them.
M	HAKIM	They said white faces don't belong here. If they don't move, shoot them. A tense beat while the men stare, then finally leave.
M	COMPUTER TECH	He's east of us. Try the market.
M	JACK O.S.	We got a signal on Tipu Road for ten minutes. Then he went to Umar Road for five minutes. Nogaza Road. Darya Abad. That's in the Umar Road area. In Rawalpindi: Haider Road, Roomi Road. He went to the Convoy Road, which is near the hospital. So that's Haider, Roomi Road, Said, No Gaza, Taimur. He made a call from Haifa Street, that's the spice district.
M	JACK	Lahore street, which is also in Pesh, thirty minutes. Wazir Bag Road, five. Nishterabad, five. Phandu Road, five minutes, the Grand Trunk Road, forty five seconds. There's no pattern. Sometimes he calls every two weeks - sometimes every three - there's no consistency - I can't predict when he's gonna make another call because the guy's erratic.
F	MAYA	Do you think its intentional?
M	JACK	It might be. Maybe it just looks erratic to us. I just can't tell.
M	REPORTER (O.S.)	Meanwhile, our chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, confirms the CIA's top spy in Pakistan has been pulled out of there.
M	REPORTER (O.S.)	He's been receiving death threats after being named publicly in a lawsuit by the family of a victim of a U.S. drone attack. Maya and Bradley and several other STAFFERS watch the protest
F	MAYA	ISI fucked you. I'm so sorry Joseph. It's the first time she's addressed him by his first name.
M	TECH	Still on tower three! Five. Signal getting stronger. Ten! Larry continues driving straight down the main road.
M	TECH (CONT'D)	Fifteen. Ten. Signal's getting weaker. We lost him - no signal.
M	LARRY	Heading South. The van passes horse-drawn carts, men on cell phones, fruit
M	TECH	He's up at five again. Fifteen. Twenty. Weaker now, he's shifted. We're back to five. I don't get it.
M	LARRY	He's driving in circles. Larry now drives very fast back to the main road.
M	LARRY (CONT'D)	No change?
M	TECH	No.
M	MAIN ROAD	And now Larry stops in the middle of the market.
M	LARRY	Let's hope he comes back around. Beat.
M	TECH	Twenty. Thirty. Forty! Fifty - we're within ten meters of him. Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell
M	TECH (CONT'D)	He's really close.
M	LARRY	Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle. Larry spots something:
M	LARRY (CONT'D)	The guy with the phone in the white
M	SUV.	They snap a photograph of a WHITE POTAHAR SUV.
M	LARRY (CONT'D)	Is that him?
M	TECH	Could be.
M	LARRY	You got him?
M	TECH	I got him.
M	LARRY	I'm breaking off - The grey minivan pulls away.
F	MAYA	Is this what I think it is?
M	LARRY	The guy you've been looking for, geo- located on his cell phone in his white car.
F	MAYA	Thank you!
M	LARRY	If you're right, the whole world's gonna want in on this, so you gotta stick to your guns now. I'm amazed that you're still here. When can we grab lunch? He sees that Maya, who hovers annoyingly over his desk, isn't I need a picket line along the GT highway and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit.
M	ALEXANDER	Maya, I know -
F	MAYA	So you agree with me now. This is important?
M	ALEXANDER	No, I've just learned from my predecessor that life is better when I don't disagree with you.
M	MAYA (V.O.)	Our current hypothesis is that he lives somewhere along the highway, in one of the towns, or a medium sized city called Abbottabod, or up near Kashmir. ECU: mango cart. Nestled among the fruit is a BLACK RADIO.
M	MAYA (V.O.)	Kashmir is interesting because it's a way station for the Tribals. We stay with the old man for a while. At last, the white POTAHAR SUV drives past. He makes a note He takes note as the white POTAHAR passes him.
M	MAYA (V.O.)	Abbottabod is interesting because we know from detainee reporting that Faraj stayed there, briefly in 2003.
M	MAYA (V.O.)	The good news is he's driving a white SUV. SUV's are actually pretty rare in Pakistan. If he was driving a sedan or a compact, we'd be fucked. Obviously this assumes he doesn't change vehicles. Maya at her desk working and we realize that she has been
M	GUARD	Good morning.
F	MAYA	Good morning, Amad. Maya gets in her car. The gate opens. As she starts pulling The gate closes, saving her, at the last possible moment. Any American in Pakistan is a target, they don't necessarily know I'm CIA.
M	ALEXANDER	Doesn't matter. You're on a list. Next time there might not be bulletproof glass to save you.
F	MAYA	Yeah.
M	ALEXANDER	And you, of all people, should know that once you are on their list, you never get off. We'll keep up on the surveillance, as best we can. The big screen displays a single image: The overhead satellite image of the compound in Abbottabod. STEVE, early 40s, a senior manager and one of George's top
M	STEVE	Basically we had a guy who rolled with Al Qaeda and did services for them. We lost him for seven years and now we found him again -- and boy does he have a really nice house. Is that it?
F	MAYA	Pretty much.
M	STEVE	Okay, let's go talk to the boss. A detailed TABLE TOP MODEL of the compound sits in the center She starts to sit in one of the chairs. You should sit back there...sorry. Steve points her to the back of the room.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	They're gonna ask: if bin Laden is at the end of this rainbow - is the Pak military with him?
F	MAYA	The question isn't are the Paks protecting bin Laden?'
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	The question is, 'would he allow himself to be protected by the Paks?' I mean, why would he trust them? He tried to kill Musharaf. Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing
M	CIA DIRECTOR	Go ahead.
M	STEVE	If you take a right out of Islamabad and drive about forty-five minutes North, you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad. A middle class community - some ex-military - not particularly interesting to us. Except we did find this compound, which is unique. We got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter, the windows are blacked out. It's a fortress.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	Can't you put a camera somewhere - in the trees - to get a look into the main house?
M	GEORGE	It will probably be discovered.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	We have to get a look into the house. The Director moves to the satellite image.
M	CIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D)	Alright, what's this? This cluster of buildings down here.
M	GEORGE	The PMA - The Pakistan Military Academy. It's their West Point.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	And how close is that to the house?
M	GEORGE	About a mile. A WOMAN'S voice from the back of the room. 4,221 feet. It's closer to eight- tenths of a mile.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	Who are you?
F	MAYA	I'm the motherfucker that found this place, Sir. The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the
M	CIA DIRECTOR	I want to know more about who's inside this house by the end of the week. The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya.
M	STEVE	"Motherfucker?" Really?
F	MAYA	Morning, George. In red magic marker, Maya writes the number 21 on the glass. George looks up.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	Twenty-one days. It's been twenty- one days since we found the house and nothing's happened! The BLIPS move in increments, shadows lengthen. George looks away. Yeah?
M	STEVE	Swing by, I want to show you something.
M	STEVE	This is from a few minutes ago. We've got two males, two females, and seven kids. Maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard.
F	MAYA	Who's that?
M	STEVE	I'm saying that's Bushra. The brother's wife.
F	MAYA	How do you know the gender?
M	STEVE	This is a clothes-line here, for laundry. Men don't mess with the wash. We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back It takes her about four seconds to move from there to the front door. So she's on the older side.
F	MAYA	What's that up there?
M	STEVE	Those are kids. They're shuffling around, sword-fighting or something with sticks. You can see their height relative to this - these are cows - so they're probably between seven and nine. Boys. Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes-
F	MAYA	Your female is moving fast.
M	STEVE	That's what I wanted to show you. Can we pause this please? That's not the same lady. That's female #3.
F	MAYA	So you found two males, three females?
M	STEVE	That's correct. Maya suddenly gets it.
F	MAYA	You're missing a male.
M	STEVE	Yes we are.
F	MAYA	Wow.
M	CONTINUOUS	George is on one side of a conference table, on the other
M	GEORGE	If there are three females, there ought to be three males. Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands. We think there's a third family living in the house.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	So this third male that you've identified as possibly being bin Laden, do I just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him?
M	GEORGE	Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer. You give up your hope right now. We scanned for heat signatures, but we can't validate if it's a man or a woman up there. We found a safe house, but we can't get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall.
M	GEORGE	We talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but there's a high risk of discovery.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	We have explored the possibility of digging tunnels, of sending hot air balloons, of re-routing supply C- 130's to take a peek, but that might be too alerting. We've looked for ways of collecting available DNA from his trash - you know, looking for his toothbrush, but they burn the trash. We started a vaccination program, we sent a doctor to the house, to see if he could pull blood. A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	That didn't work out. We thought about sending a guy with a bucket to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze his fecal matter.
M	SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR	What was wrong with that, exactly? He looks up.
M	GEORGE	What was wrong with that? The sample would be too diluted.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	And it's asking too much to get a voice confirmation with him on the phone?
M	GEORGE	They don't make telephone calls from the compound. We pulled the cell tower nearby.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	And I'm also going to give up hope that he might ever get in that white SUV and drive around a bit and we could see him? Don't they get groceries.
M	GEORGE	The unidentified third male does not get groceries. He does not leave the compound. He does not present himself for photographs. When he needs fresh air, he paces around beneath a grape arbor, but the leaves are so thick they obscure our satellite views. This is a professional attempt to avoid detection - real tradecraft. The only people we've seen behave this way are other top level Al Qaeda operatives. The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	We did a Red Team on your analysis. According to them, this behavior could belong to someone other than Al Qaeda.
M	DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	They did give a forty percent chance that the unidentified third man is a senior Al Qaeda operative. But they also said there's a thirty-five percent chance he's a Saudi drug
M	DEALER	A fifteen percent chance that he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent chance that he's one of the relatives of the brothers.
M	SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR	Basically, we agree with you, the house screams security, it screams someone who wants privacy, it even screams 'bad guy', but it does not scream bin Laden.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	You get the point. If you can't prove it's bin Laden, at least prove it's not somebody else, like a drug dealer. Beat. The meeting is adjourned. As they walk out --
M	GEORGE	You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program. Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up? He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	You'll think of something. We watch as she erases the numbers in red and writes new Time passes. 100 days. She underscores the numerals in thick magic marker.
M	GEORGE	He'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs. He has no internet access to the house. He makes no phone calls either in or out. Who's he selling to, who's he buying from, how's he making his money? And if you're going to say he's retired, I'd say where's his swimming pool, where's the gold cage with the falcons? And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda, that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production? The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	The President is a thoughtful, analytical guy. He needs proof.
M	GEORGE	I have to admit, I just don't get the rhythms of politics.
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	You think this is political? If this was political we'd be having this conversation in October when there's an election bump. This is pure risk. Based on deductive reasoning, inference, supposition and the only human reporting you have is six years old, from detainees who are questioned under duress. The political move here is to tell you to go fuck yourself, and remind you that I was in the room when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq...at least there you guys brought photographs.
M	GEORGE	You know, you're right, I agree with everything you just said. What I meant was, a man in your position, how do you evaluate the risk of not doing something, the risk of potentially letting bin Laden slip through your fingers? George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	That is a fascinating question. George walks away. After a beat, the National Security
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR	Hey. George turns around. The National Security Advisor approaches
M	NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (CONT'D)	I'm not saying we're gonna do it. But the President wants to know: if we were going to act, how would we do it? Give us options.
M	GENERAL	I actually tried to kill this program a couple of times. They've gone through an initial round of testing, and they have excellent radar defeat - we just haven't tested them with people in them yet. The General continues his briefing..
M	GENERAL (CONT'D)	You'll notice these stealth panels similar to what we use on the B2 - - The rotors have been muffled with decibel killers - it's slower than a Blackhawk and lacks the offense. But it can hide.
M	JUSTIN	Excuse me. Can I ask a question? What do we need this for in Libya? Gaddafi's anti-air is virtually non- existent. Maya looks over, not sure what to say.
M	GEORGE	Gentlemen, can I have your attention? My name is George. I run the Af-Pak division at CTC, and I'm primary on this for the agency. This is a title fifty operation.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	Some of us have worked together before. This is a good one. Maya, do you want to brief them? Maya looks at the SEALs. Folds her arms. This isn't going
F	MAYA	There are two narratives about the location of Osama bin Laden. This registers on the SEALs.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	The one that you're most familiar with is that UBL is hiding in a cave in the Tribal Areas, that he's surrounded by a large contingent of loyal fighters. Beat. But that narrative is pre- 9/11 understanding of UBL. The second narrative is that he's living in a city - living in a city with multiple points of egress and entries and with access to communications so that he can keep in touch with the organization. You can't run a global network of inter- connected cells from a cave. Beat.
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	We've located an individual we believe based on detainee reporting is bin Laden's courier. He's living in a house in Abbottabod, Pakistan. And we assess that one of the other occupants of the house is UBL.
M	JUSTIN	Excuse me. You got an intel source on the ground?
F	MAYA	No.
M	JUSTIN	No? Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden? We've been on this op before, you know.
F	MAYA	Bin Laden uses a courier to interact with the outside world. By locating the courier, we've located bin Laden.
M	PATRICK	That's really the intel? That's it?
F	MAYA	Quite frankly, I didn't even want to use you guys, with your dip and your velcro and all your gear bullshit. I wanted to drop a bomb but people didn't believe in this lead enough to drop a bomb, so they're using you guys as canaries on the theory that if bin Laden isn't there, you can sneak away and no one will be the wiser. But bin Laden is there - and you're going to kill him for me. Bullets are cheap.
M	GEORGE	They are nervous downtown. I don't think we'll get approval this decision cycle. They look up and notice that Maya is standing outside George's Wolf nods.
M	WOLF	It's her against the world.
M	GEORGE	Oh yeah.
F	MAYA	We've spun up the SEALs - we've done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound, and the collection is not going to get any better.
M	GEORGE	We have to keep working it.
F	MAYA	You're going to come into work one day, and there's going to be a black moving van and a 'for sale' sign in front of that compound. George drops his tray down.
M	GEORGE	Maya, you didn't prove it.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	I'm about to go look the President in the eye and what I'd like to know, no fucking bullshit, is where everyone stands on this thing. Now, very simply. Is he there or is he not fucking there? He looks to the Deputy Director.
M	DEPUTY DIRECTOR	We all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences. I remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I fronted that and I can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	Yes or no.
M	DEPUTY DIRECTOR	We don't deal in certainty, we deal in probability. I'd say there's a sixty percent probability he's there. The CIA Director points to Wolf.
M	WOLF	I concur. Sixty percent.
M	GEORGE	I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC is what convinces me.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	You guys ever agree on anything?
M	DANIEL	Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms - who knows? Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor.
M	DANIEL (CONT'D)	I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm virtually certain there's some high value target there, I'm just not sure it's bin Laden. The CIA Director leans back in his chair.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it?
M	JEREMY	I'd like to know what Maya thinks.
M	DEPUTY DIRECTOR	We're all incorporating her assessment into ours. Maya can't take it anymore:
F	MAYA	One hundred percent, he's there - okay, fine, ninety-five percent because I know certainty freaks you guys out - but it's a hundred!
M	CIA DIRECTOR	They're all cowed. What do you think of the girl?
M	JEREMY	I think she's fucking smart. As the door closes.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	We're all smart, Jeremy.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	May I join you? She nods, gulps. How long have you worked for the
F	MAYA	Twelve years. I was recruited out of high school.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	Do you know why we did that?
F	MAYA	I don't think I can answer that question, sir. I don't think I'm allowed to answer.
M	CIA DIRECTOR	What else have you done for us besides bin Laden?
F	MAYA	Nothing. I've done nothing else. He evaluates her... weighing her certainty against his decades
M	CIA DIRECTOR	Well, you certainly have a flare for it. Everything in motion, SOLDIERS, CONTRACTORS, AVIATION ASSETS,
M	JUSTIN	So, Patrick, be honest with me. You really believe this story? No offense.
M	PATRICK	I do.
M	JUSTIN	What part convinced you? Patrick motions to Maya.
M	PATRICK	Her confidence. Maya smiles, laughs.
M	JUSTIN	Really? Okay. That's the kind of concrete data point I'm looking for. He shakes his head.
M	JUSTIN (CONT'D)	If her confidence is the one thing that's keeping me from getting ass- raped in a Pakistani prison...I don't know. I'm gonna be honest with you though, I guess I'm cool with it. They bump fists, laughing. Maya's cell phone rings. She We INTERCUT with George in his Langley office.
M	GEORGE	Maya, I wanted you to hear it first. You know that thing we talked about? It's going to happen.
F	MAYA	When?
M	GEORGE	Tonight. Good luck. She hangs up, turns back to the SEALs, who are still playing The small space is filled with personnel and
F	MAYA	Testing - testing 1 - 2 - 3 - A SEAL with his com set on gives her the thumbs up. She
F	MAYA	Thank you for coming with me.
M	HAKIM	Of course. I'll go with you where ever you want. A few hundred feet in front of them they can see SEALs
F	MAYA	Fuck Hakim, what if I'm wrong?
M	MAYA (CONT'D)	I wish we could have just dropped a bomb.
M	HAKIM	Please don't drop it while we're in the house.
F	MAYA	I'm serious.
M	HAKIM	Me too. Don't drop anything while I'm inside. Off her anxious smile -- Blinding white lights - rigged to chain link fencing, like a Silhouetted shapes behind the lights and the thump-thump-
M	LZ	A top-secret LZ. Where twenty-two SEALs in full battle rattle and an attack - Doors slam, engines whine - Fifty yards away, Maya stands alone, looking on. The helos near the Tora Bora mountain range: dimly visible
M	PRINCE 51 PILOT	Thirty seconds to first turn.
M	JARED	Hey Justin, what are you listening to?
M	JUSTIN	Tony Robbins.
M	JARED	Tony Robbins?
M	JUSTIN	You should listen to it. I got plans for after this. I want to talk to you guys about it. It's not selling. You become a representative. Everyone chuckles.
M	PRINCE 51 CO-PILOT	Hard left.
M	PATRICK	Who here's been in a helo crash before? Everyone raises their hands.
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Okay, so we're all good. Technicians track the helos on an array of computer screens. Now entering Pakistan. Maya is here, too, working. She's always working. Pakistani coms, no chatter. The terrain zooms by as we travel through a twisty mountain - Looming straight ahead on a collision course is a GIANT Big left! DUST blows off the mountain.
M	PILOT	Ten minutes.
M	PILOT	Three mikes to target. Standby for doors open. Inside the dim interior, illuminated by only blinking Some of them are anonymous soldiers. Many we've come to
M	CO-PILOT	Two minutes. Should be coming up just off our nose, 3 o'clock. Everyone grabs onto their gear, getting ready to fast rope.
M	DOOR	Patrick flings open the side door. Night wind rushes in -
M	PILOT	Thirty seconds. Patrick leans out for a visual as the wind rips his face - - At thirty feet above the ground the helicopter begins to
M	PATRICK	Hey! Slide right. - Then lurches down, falling to within 15 feet of the swirling
M	PRINCE 51 PILOT	Power! -- Engines straining LOUDLY in the thin, hot air The command tent watches the helicopter crash.
M	PRINCE 52 PILOT (O.S.)	Prince 51 is down. Blackhawk down in the animal pen. Maya stands, crestfallen. This mission is still a go. Off Maya's relief - - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle
M	JARED	Ir-fah ee-dek! You killed him. FOUR KIDS are cowering in the corner. Jared moves them out
M	SABER	That's not a door.
M	SEAL	Failed breach. They hustle to the next entry way and prepare another breach This is Echo 11, we're going to breach the main gate. Negative. I'm internal, I'll let you in. The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs
M	JUSTIN	Abrar! The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, ABRAR, re-appears at the - And is shot by Justin. He falls out of view, whimpering - Justin shoots her. She falls...Abrar is underneath her - - Justin shoots him again, silencing him
M	JUSTIN	Shut those fucking kids up. O.S. the kids quiet down.
M	JUSTIN (CONT'D)	Talk to me.
M	BREACHER	There's no fucking way we want to blow this thing. The gate is solid. This is Echo 11 - we're at our primary set point, prepping to breach. Wait, Echo 11 - we're internal on the south side - this is a negative breach. Roger. We're ready to make our entry out here. Roger that, we're coming to meet you. Stay with these kids. Don't let them in the back room. You good?
M	JUSTIN	Yeah. I forgot...were we supposed to crash that helo? Patrick allows himself a smile.
M	PATRICK	Ibrahim tried to shoot me through the door. I popped him from the outside.
M	JUSTIN	I fucking smoked Abrar and his wife.
M	PATRICK	Still alive?
M	JUSTIN	She's gonna bleed out.
M	PATRICK	What a fuckin' mess - The door blows - and they keep moving -
M	SEAL	Breacher up. A charge is prepared. Justin, who is now inside one of the
M	JUSTIN	Hey man, move! Jared moves just as -
M	- Boooom!	-- The door FLIES like a missile right into where Jared had Thanks.
M	JUSTIN	Yeah.
M	SABER	Khaled! Saber waits with his carbine raised. Anxiety crosses his He hears his name again, "Khaled!" And the voice sounds Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the
M	SEAL	This is Echo 05, I've got unknowns gathering on the Southwest Rooftops. Hakim, move those guys back.
M	HAKIM	Go back brothers, this is official government business, and there is nothing to see here!!
M	SEAL	I'm going to start wasting them.
M	HAKIM	Please! They will kill you! The onlookers pause. SEAL aiming lasers dance across their
M	HAKIM (CONT'D)	They will kill you! They turn and go. Osama! Osama!? Beat. Beat. Sweat on Saber's face
M	SABER (CONT'D)	Osama!? A man appears at the end of the third floor hallway. - Saber fires again, missing - And proceeds down the hallway, going full speed now, Possible jackpot. The women Saber is restraining are wailing, struggling to Patrick pushes him away and kneels down to get a better look Dude, do you realize what you just did? Who is he?
M	WOMAN	He is al Noori Hasan.
M	JARED	She says it's not him.
M	PATRICK	Talk to a kid. Jared kneels down next to a nine year-old girl huddled in Daughter, what is his name? The girl makes no reply.
M	COMMANDING OFFICER (O.S.)	For God and Country, Geronimo. Maya gasps. All Stations: target secure, target secure. Roger. Copy. Target Secure.
M	COMMANDING OFFICER (O.S.)	Target Secure - commence SSE. The lights show an organized office, crammed with information, Twenty years of jihad.
M	JUSTIN	Do not leave a hard drive. The SEALs gather everything they can. What's up?
M	SABER	I shot the third floor guy.
M	JUSTIN	Good for you. You want to help? Justin tosses him an SSE bag. The command team studies their monitors. QRF inbound. Echo 05, this is Red 02, how long do you need for SSE? At least ten minutes. You have four. This is a gold mine, I need more time than that. If you're not at the LZ in four, I'm going to leave your ass behind.
M	JUSTIN	Four minutes! - blood stains on the walls, - Bodies pierced with bullets, - Wailing children. Where do you need the bag?
M	SEAL (O.S.)	Third floor. At last, she hears it. A moment later, PRINCE 52 hovers into view and lands. Patrick She walks and walks towards the bag. She is alone with it now. She unzips the BAG CU: Maya. Seven years telescoping to this moment. The end of a journey. Sir, the agency expert gave a visual confirmation. Yes, Sir, the girl. Hundred percent. Maya gazes at the bloodied face, then turns away and zips Her eyes afire.
M	PILOT	Are you Maya?
F	MAYA	Yeah.
M	PILOT	That's the only name they gave me. You can sit wherever you want, you're the only one on the manifest. Maya sits down, buckles in. The PILOT heads back to the
M	PILOT (CONT'D)	You must be pretty important, you got the whole plane to yourself! Beat. Where do you want to go? She's speechless. Overwhelmed. Finally, she lets go. Those luminous eyes become pools of relief and pain.
