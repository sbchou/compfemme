M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)	so, Mark O'Brien graduates from one of 250 English majors to degrees today.
M	NEWS REPORTER	If this report tells us anything, it is that a disability is not necessarily a handicap.
M	NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D)	Mark O'Brien teaches us that courage and perseverance overcome obstacles. With Mark O'Brien at UC Berkeley, Bill Hillman, Channel Five Eyewitness News. It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean. Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life.
M	MARK	Shit!
M	MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Okay, just focus. Now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind...
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Good morning. JOAN, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to She comes in.
F	JOAN	Good morning.
M	MARK	You're late.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Joan I swear this was one crazy bitch Who'd swing me about enough to scare me, But careful enough so she could say: "Now what was all the yelling about? You polios are screamers. Always were." I didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, And thought about revenge. A LITTLE LATER Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
F	JOAN	Would you mind if I asked you a favor?
M	MARK	You need help moving furniture?
F	JOAN	I need an advance on my pay, like two weeks. That's not a big ask, is it?
M	MARK	What if you don't last another two weeks? 4A.
M	MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Joan never failed to put me in a crappy mood. It was also a drag that I was no longer allowed to use my other gurney, the self-propelled one. It had caused a couple of spectacular accidents. Basically, in spite of all the mirrors, I couldn't see where I was going. FATHER BRENDAN is giving a sermon. Mark listens with
M	FATHER BRENDAN	The Apostle Luke tells us that when Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby in her womb leapt - "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy". So Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose. Elizabeth saw the greatness in Mary. "Blessed art thou among women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John, felt the power of this wondrous woman. It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave Mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour".
M	May the spirit of the Lord be	amongst you and remain with you always.
M	FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	May the peace of the Lord be with you.
M	PARISHIONERS	And also with you.
M	A LITTLE LATER	5A.
M	MARK (V.O.)	I'm definitely a true believer. But I believe in a God with a sense of humor. A wicked sense of humor. One who created me in His own image.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Hello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't think we've met.
M	MARK	No, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I knew Father Seamus very well. I'm sorry that he's not here any more.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	As are many others. I'm going to do my best to fill his shoes. I understand you'd like me to hear your confession.
M	MARK	Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed Mass. I liked your tone.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Thank you.
M	MARK	You don't believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional, do you?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	No, I do not. I believe sincerity is the most essential part.
M	MARK	I told my attendant to come back in half an hour. Is that okay?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Yes, take your time. I'm in no rush.
M	MARK	Did Father Seamus say anything to you about me? FATHER BRENDAN No one said anything to me about you.
M	MARK	I can be a bit time consuming, but I'm worth the trouble.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I'm here for you Mark.
M	MARK	Look, this is not exactly a confession. I haven't yet done the deed. I was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Tell me what's on your mind.
M	MARK	The most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, Joan. I'm thinking of getting rid of her. It's an evil thought, but I can't help it.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Is she dishonest, or incompetent?
M	MARK	No, neither of those. She looks at me the wrong way. It's that you- need-me-more-than-I-need-you look. I'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me. Is that a sin, Father?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Well, it obviously troubles you.
M	MARK	Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because maybe it's really a power trip. Me against her. Me against the world.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I really wouldn't worry too much about that. The question is whether you like having her around.
M	MARK	I can't stand her.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Then get rid of her. If I were in a position to choose, I'd get someone nice. Even it was a power trip.
M	MARK	Then I have your blessing to fire her?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Unofficially, yes.
M	MARK	That's good enough for me.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Please, if ever you feel I can be useful, do let me know. It was a pleasure talking with you.
M	MARK	Same here. We see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping A community notice board. A young female hand reaches in and
M	MARK (V.O.)	Amanda would have been a pretty girl to touch, to hold, to kiss, to take to bed. Mark is in his iron lung. Amanda sits in a stiff chair a few Her perfect, pale skin, Her Tudor court face Her strong, fleshy legs Drove me into ecstasies of despair.
M	MARK	Do you have any experience?
F	AMANDA	No, none at all.
M	MARK	That sounds perfect. From Mark's POV, Amanda slides him out of the iron lung. It
F	AMANDA	How long can you stay out?
M	MARK	Three or four hours. Depends whether I'm having fun. DAY
M	MARK (V.O.)	She'd count in French before lifting me, un, deux, trois, quatre! I'd scream Tugged by her athletic arms From the everlasting gravity. Mark, on a blanket, is on an outing with Amanda, Matt and
M	MARK (V.O.)	She took me on a picnic once, With her boyfriend and another couple. Lust crackled in the air between those twentyish people.
M	MARK (V.O.)	What did the boyfriend think? That I was in his way? I'm always in somebody's way, I thought, the sun in my eyes.
M	MARK (V.O.)	As she glided through crowds of lives She couldn't leave me lying there Dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence. Amanda and her boyfriend MATT, are sharing the tub.
M	MATT	Do you touch him?
F	AMANDA	I do everything. Any other questions?
M	MATT	You don't have to be so defensive. I'm not about to get jealous.
F	AMANDA	Why not? He's a much nicer person than you are. Amanda is shaving Mark.
M	MARK	What does your boyfriend think of me?
F	AMANDA	He's an asshole. It doesn't matter what he thinks of you.
M	MARK	I'm interested in the opinion of an asshole.
F	AMANDA	He thinks you're some kind of Svengali, and that you're going to hypnotise me into your cult.
M	MARK	He's right.
F	AMANDA	He says he can already see changes.
M	MARK (V.O.)	So with her gentle fearless heart She took me in. I thrived in her garden And wanted more. Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store,
F	AMANDA	This you must have.
M	MARK	I love you. Mark and Father Brendan are huddled together in the little
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Did she reciprocate your feelings?
M	MARK	She didn't seem to. 11A.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	people can be very shy their emotions.
M	MARK	Well, in case she didn't get it the first time, I told her again that I was in love with her, and wanted to marry her, thinking it might swing things.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Did it?
M	MARK	Yes. She left.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I wish I knew what to say. I mean, welcome to the human race. Every day someone breaks someone else's heart. And as I said, I'm here for you. I just wish I had something more useful to offer. All I have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with. Have you ever thought of discussing your feelings with a therapist?
M	MARK	Not as yet. Father, I think I need a hug. Rod is in the front yard picking up the newspaper. He sees
M	ROD	Hi. Vera?
F	VERA	Yes.
M	ROD	I'm Rod. I do four to twelve. Vera sits in the same spot where Amanda was interviewed, but
M	MARK	Have you had any experience?
F	VERA	Some.
M	MARK	Would you get that, please.
F	VERA	Hullo.
M	VERA (CONT'D)	It's Sandy, from Pacific News Service.
M	MARK	Could you press that button and put it on the speakerphone.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Hi, Sandy. Hi, Mark, how you doing?
M	MARK	I'm good. I have a new attendant. She answered the phone. Her name's Vera. Welcome, Vera.
F	VERA	Thank you. Mark, we've gotten sponsorships to do a series on sex and the disabled and we'd like you to do some interviews in the Berkeley area. Could you do that? Say in the next week or so?
M	MARK	Why now?
M	SANDY (V.O.)	No particular reason. If you're working on something else, then we can talk about it later.
M	MARK	No, now is fine. Vera wheels Mark towards his first interview. The more we see There was no denying it. A door had opened which I could not close, and in invisible writing it said: "Do not enter". We see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette
M	CARMEN (V.O.)	Some positions, like that one, are pretty much impossible.
F	CARMEN	I don't know if you can quite visualize it. It's called a lateral, or sideways reverse cow- girl. worry about it then. It's a question of depth of
M	CARMEN (CONT'D)	To some people it's really important, like my partner, for example. It's not such a big deal for me. I get just as excited when he licks my nipples, if and when he bothers to do it.
M	CARMEN (CONT'D)	I think the tape's about to run out.
M	CARMEN (CONT'D)	Do you want to keep going?
M	MARK	Uh, I think I've actually got enough to work on. Thanks.
F	CARMEN	Get back to me if you need anything else. Oh, and let me give you Greg's phone number. He's full of stuff you wouldn't think was possible. Rod vacuums the floor while Mark taps away on his typewriter.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Okay, shall we start?
M	GREG (V.O.)	Sure.
M	GREG	Oral sex is a matter of taste.
M	GREG (CONT'D)	And one thing that really works in my favor is that I smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded. This gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department, and stamina is key in cunnilingus. The alley cat creeps in through the open window. Mark watches
M	MARK	Who are these people? I feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters. A lady with a crisp voice answers the phone.
M	LADY (V.O.)	Good morning. UCSF.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Uh, may I please speak to someone in the Center on Sexuality and Disability, please.
M	LADY (V.O.)	I'm sorry sir, the Center on Sexuality and Disability has been shut down. Mark looks immensely relieved. He closes his eyes.
M	MARK	Thank God.
M	LADY (V.O.)	Sir?
M	MARK	I'm sorry to have bothered you. It's no bother...Sir, before you go, I can give you a phone number for one of the therapists who used to work there. Would you like that? Sir, are you there? It is a typical, modern, multi-purpose office building. We There is something of a commotion going on at one of the
M	MARK	It won't fit. It's not going to fit. Let's go back.
M	LATINO	Hey, it's fine. We got you. This is going to work just fine.
F	VERA	The top has to go over to the left. 17A.
M	MARK	I don't feel so good about this. Let's forget it.
F	VERA	Look, do you want to see this woman or not?
M	MARK	No!
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Aah!
F	VERA	Well, it's too late. Laura, a well-dressed, attractive woman in her late 30s, sits
F	LAURA	Did you ever discuss sex with your parents?
M	MARK	No. That would have been unthinkable.
F	LAURA	Why?
M	MARK	That's the way they saw the world. It wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex. No-one did. It was never discussed. As far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there.
F	LAURA	Sorry about that.
M	MARK	What's that from?
F	LAURA	Cerebral palsy.
M	MARK	You'd hardly notice.
F	LAURA	People notice. It's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic.
M	MARK	I find that hard to believe in your case.
F	LAURA	Well, you better believe it.
M	MARK	So, what sort of chance do you give me?
F	LAURA	Of achieving your romantic fantasy? Very small to minute.
M	MARK	Look, there's no need to pull any punches. You can be as direct as you like with me.
F	LAURA	Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist. I try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed. Your problem, I understand, is that you have never had sex.
M	MARK	That's correct.
F	LAURA	Would I be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate?
M	MARK	Correct.
F	LAURA	Has anyone done it for you?
M	MARK	No.
F	LAURA	Have you ever asked anyone?
M	MARK	Not specifically. I asked someone to marry me. She declined. Does that come close to masturbation?
F	LAURA	You know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually. There are people called sex surrogates.
M	MARK	Oh?
F	LAURA	Psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients, even if it seems like a good idea. Sex surrogates don't have that limitation.
M	MARK	Would this be covered by my medical benefits?
F	LAURA	Unfortunately, no. You'd have to pay the full fee, whatever that was.
M	MARK	So, basically, I would be paying for sex.
F	LAURA	Yes Mark, you would be paying for sex. But the person you would be paying is not a hooker. She is a highly trained and sensitive professional, who is not motivated by money. Just as I'm not. In fact, you can think of a surrogate as an extension of me. Do I seem like a hooker to you? MARK What sort of cost would I be looking at?
F	LAURA	It depends how many sessions you need.
M	MARK	Say, one, just to try it and see if I like it.
F	LAURA	I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way. It's a process. You have to be patient with yourself. There can be quite a lot of talking involved.
M	MARK	I've set aside $500. Do you think that would cover things?
F	LAURA	Oh yes, that's ample. So, what do you think? Rod wheels Mark into the church. Mark waits in the little side chapel. Father Brendan enters.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Hi, good to see you. How are things?
M	MARK	Things are sort of confusing at the moment. I would appreciate your advice, as a friend, if you know what I mean.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Sure, and I understand what you mean.
M	MARK	Do you remember at one point you suggested I might see a therapist?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Yes.
M	MARK	Well, one way or another, it's a long story, I ended up seeing a therapist, a particular sort of therapist, a sex therapist.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Uh-huh.
M	MARK	My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan. Sometimes I ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	All I feel is shame and mortification, while other men, apparently, get pleasure. I'm sorry if I sound angry.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Don't worry about it. Go on.
M	MARK	This therapist suggested I could work with a sexual specialist, have sex with someone known as a sex surrogate, who would be sensitive to my special needs. I've been giving it some thought.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Hold on. What do you mean "have sex"? MARK Well, I don't really know how to describe...
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Sorry, that wasn't what... I mean, are we talking about sexual intercourse? MARK I think so.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Outside marriage? MARK I did do my best on the question of marriage.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	What is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute? I don't know, but I think there's a difference. 23A.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	do you know she's not some gussied up as a social who's just going to rob
M	MARK	trust what my therapist said her.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	old are you?
M	MARK	
M	FATHER BRENDAN	exactly now?
M	MARK	never had any spare cash before. a major factor, and I'm getting close to my use-by
M	FATHER BRENDAN	this is what you want my advice Fornication?
M	MARK	advice as a friend.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	do I have the casting vote, so speak?
M	MARK	say I value your advice just much as I do the therapist's.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	serious, aren't you?
M	MARK	think sex is a serious matter. one of the most persistent in the bible. So, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do I want to find out?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	And you want my opinion?
M	MARK	Please.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I know in my heart that He'll give you a free pass on this one. Go for it.
M	MARK	What?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I said, go for it. MARK Really?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	If you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it?
M	MARK	To tell the truth, I'm scared.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Then we should pray.
M	FATHER BRENDAN (CONT'D)	Sweet Jesus, Mark and I sit at your feet and pray that You bless this little journey, this one small step for a man.
M	OMITTED 35	ROD is wheeling Mark along in his gurney.
M	MARK	I really feel proud of myself, imposing on someone I hardly know, to fornicate in their home.
M	ROD	Get over it. It's perfectly normal. Carmen, in her electric wheelchair, is the woman Mark had
F	CARMEN	Tada!
M	MARK	Wow!
F	CARMEN	There are all sorts of useful things in that drawer there, if you guys feel like exploring.
M	MARK	No, I'll bring my own sheets, towels and anything else we need.
F	CARMEN	No, no. Everything will be provided. I'm honored that you asked me. It'll be great karma for the house. Rod is wheeling Mark back home.
M	MARK	Great karma for the house. My God, the pressure, already. I can't stand it.
M	OMITTED 42	We are outside an old-style wooden house with a Volvo wagon We hear the sound of sneakers on a wood floor. TONY, an
M	TONY	Hey, this is Tony.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Cheryl! What is it?
M	TONY	Phone!
M	TONY (CONT'D)	She's coming.
F	CHERYL	I'm not your girlfriend. When someone calls, particularly someone you don't know, you can use the word 'Mom'.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Hullo, this is Cheryl.
M	LAURA (V.O.)	Hi, it's Laura.
F	CHERYL	I haven't heard from you in a while. How are you? Pretty well. Look, I called to ask how you would feel about working with a severely disabled client.
F	CHERYL	Hold on a moment, please.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Hey, cut that out! Mark is having a bed bath. His shoulders and neck are covered
M	MARK	Would you get it please?
M	ROD	Sure.
M	ROD (CONT'D)	Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone.
M	CHERYL (V.O.)	Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene. May I speak to Mark? Rod holds the phone toward Mark like a question. Mark's face
M	ROD	Just one moment, please. What am I doing here? Yes or no? Make up your mind.
M	MARK	Hullo, this is Mark.
M	CHERYL (V.O.)	Hi, Mark. I'm Cheryl. Laura called to introduce you. I understand you'd like to meet. Is that right?
M	MARK	Uh, yes. I could see you on the seventeenth, at eleven o'clock. Would that be any good for you?
M	MARK	Uh, yes, I think that would be fine for me.
F	CHERYL	Hey, where you from?
M	MARK	Boston. You?
F	CHERYL	Salem. Small world.
M	MARK	Wouldn't want to paint it. Cheryl is on the phone, holding the receiver with one hand
F	CHERYL	We'll be talking for a while to begin with. Then, if you agree, we can also start doing some body awareness exercises in your first session. The iron lung pumps away. Mark is alone. He stares at the
M	MARK	Holy Mother of God, what are "body awareness exercises"? Vera lets herself in. Vera holds up two shirts for Mark to see, a dark red and a
F	VERA	Which one?
M	MARK	Doesn't matter.
F	VERA	Will you stop acting as if you're going to your own execution.
M	MARK	I'm not acting. Vera wheels Mark to his doom.
F	VERA	Try and think of something else. Baseball, for example. That's what they usually tell boys to do.
M	MARK	Who are "they"?
M	MARK (CONT'D)	She's forgotten.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	My God, she's forgotten, or she's gotten the date wrong. Okay, we might as well turn round and go back. Come on, let's go. 30A.
F	VERA	She hasn't forgotten. Vera eases Mark onto the bed, positioning him so that he can
F	CARMEN	Okay, I'm going. I'll be back some time after one. If I'm not here, just let yourselves out.
F	VERA	Bye.
M	MARK	Bye.
F	CARMEN	Have fun.
M	MARK	What's the time?
F	VERA	Twelve after eleven.
M	MARK	I think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts.
F	VERA	Mark, please calm down.
M	MARK	And if she does arrive, she would be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.
F	CHERYL	Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.
F	VERA	No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers.
F	CHERYL	Hi, Mark O'Brien.
M	MARK	Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.
F	VERA	I'll be back, say, in two hours?
F	CHERYL	Yes, two hours, that would be perfect.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	So...
M	MARK	Your money's on the dresser.
F	CHERYL	Thank you.
M	MARK	That was the wrong way to start off.
F	CHERYL	Yes, it was. Shall we start again?
M	MARK	Please, you start.
F	CHERYL	Although the aim is for us to have sex, I'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front. I've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference. We can talk about that later.
M	MARK	I'm sorry.
F	CHERYL	The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. Did Laura mention that when you saw her?
M	MARK	I'm sorry, I don't remember.
F	CHERYL	The limit is six. But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. Now, I understand you are able to have an erection.
M	MARK	Yes, but not out of choice.
F	CHERYL	Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection?
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Is this your place?
M	MARK	No, it's a friend's. The only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung. I've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose.
F	CHERYL	It's worth thinking about.
M	MARK	I've got the space. It can be expensive though, a nice futon. I mean, how much do you think a good one would cost?
F	CHERYL	Mark, just take a deep breath, then let go.
M	MARK	Do I seem anxious?
F	CHERYL	You do a little. lies down beside him.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Laura told me you were a poet. What's it like to be a poet?
M	MARK	It's a way of living inside your own head, which is where I spend most of my time.
F	CHERYL	But not today. By the way, I like your shirt.
M	MARK	Thank you.
F	CHERYL	So I need to ask you some basic questions. Okay?
M	MARK	Sure.
F	CHERYL	What is the iron lung for?
M	MARK	It keeps me breathing. I can spend a few hours outside of it, with my portable respirator, depending on how I feel. But I work and sleep in the iron lung. 34A. do you feel right now?
M	MARK	Out of my league.
F	CHERYL	I meant your breathing. MARK Oh...fine. In fact, better than usual.
F	CHERYL	That's great. Do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity? Any parts of your body you don't want me to touch?
M	MARK	I have normal sensitivity all over. It's just that my muscles don't work. You can touch me anywhere.
F	CHERYL	Shall we get undressed then?
M	MARK	Sure.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!
F	CHERYL	What's wrong?
M	MARK	Holy Mother of God!
F	CHERYL	Tell me what's wrong.
M	MARK	My fingers! They're caught!
F	CHERYL	Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't worry.
M	MARK	Be careful, please.
F	CHERYL	Mark, I'm going to be really careful with you. I don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me. Okay?
M	MARK	I won't yell at you any more.
F	CHERYL	But you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt? MARK Yes. CHERYL Now, let's do the other arm.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Nice shirt.
M	MARK	You already said that.
F	CHERYL	Did I? I guess I'm a little anxious, too.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Okay, I'm going to slide these down. Hold your breath.
M	MARK	Shit, fuck! No, don't do that! 36A. Cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the Cheryl turns off the tap. She has done a great job of pulling Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress.
F	CHERYL	Ready?
M	MARK	No.
F	CHERYL	Okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that I don't want your return business. I'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner.
M	MARK	Whenever I'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed. Now that I'm in bed with another naked person, I'm very confused.
F	CHERYL	So, why is it confusing?
M	MARK	I'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening.
F	CHERYL	Mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch. I'd like you to tell me how it feels each time I touch a different part of your body. If something feels good, tell me. If something feels ticklish or bothers you, let me know. I don't want you to tolerate anything. I'm going to start with the top of your head...
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	You have soft hair. It's nice to the touch. So you like it?
M	MARK	I do.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	That feels weird.
F	CHERYL	Weird good? Or weird bad?
M	MARK	Just weird.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Good.
F	CHERYL	Still good?
M	MARK	Everything good so far, except the ear. 37B. these the body awareness
F	CHERYL	You're clever to have worked that out.
M	MARK	People tell me I'm very perceptive.
F	CHERYL	Would you like to see what I feel like?
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Are you wearing cologne?
M	MARK	Yes.
F	CHERYL	Mmm, my favorite brand. Okay, I'm going to move my hand along your stomach... and down to your pen...
M	MARK	Oh, oh. The clock on the mantelpiece says 12:48. Cheryl is now fully
F	CHERYL	Next week, Friday the twentieth, same time?
M	MARK	That's good for me.
F	CHERYL	Next time we'll start to work on intercourse.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me?
M	MARK	I was terrified.
F	CHERYL	You can be proud of yourself. You did great. We've made real progress.
M	MARK	Can I ask you something?
F	CHERYL	Of course. What would you like to ask?
M	MARK	Anything, really. Tell me something about yourself. Anything.
F	CHERYL	Sure. I'm a very private person. I have a private life, I do need you to be aware of that, but that's about it. This therapy is about you.
M	MARK	Welcome back.
F	CHERYL	Perfect timing.
F	CARMEN	I hope you guys kept the noise down. Vera wheels Mark back the way they came. She is very discreet
F	VERA	do you feel?
M	MARK	and victorious.
F	VERA	get any better than that.
M	MARK	me about your first sexual
F	VERA	me think. It wasn't all that I mean, it was consensual everything, and I really was in with the guy, but his dick enormous to me, I didn't it would fit. It was scary. he was nice. I guess he help it.
M	MARK	he Chinese?
F	VERA	you kidding? I only hung out white guys at high school.
M	MARK	is that?
F	VERA	don't know. To stick it to my mum dad, I suppose.
M	MARK	they happy now you've got a boyfriend?
F	VERA	happy. I'm happy.
M	MARK	his dick like?
F	VERA	size.
M	MARK	do you call it a dick instead a penis?
F	VERA	Penis sounds like some vegetable you don't want to eat. Dick sounds like what it is.
M	MARK	The thing is, it was all over so damn quickly.
F	VERA	Yes, tell me about it. Cheryl's car is parked outside. The house is mostly dark. Cheryl is at a tiny desk, dictating into a recorder.
F	CHERYL	First session. Mark is the oldest of four children and raised Catholic. He was extremely nervous. He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt, but I think more out of fear than pain. He cannot masturbate. Has only had the occasional kissing experience. He is capable of achieving an erection easily, but the unusual curvature of his body could be a serious obstacle to intercourse. Cheryl gets into bed beside her husband JOSH, who is
F	CHERYL	This gentleman I just started working with. He spends most of his life trapped in a big metal box.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Did you hear what I said?
M	JOSH	Yes, I heard what you said. You're a saint.
F	CHERYL	Don't forget to put the trash out in the morning. Mark is in the little side chapel with Father Brendan.
M	MARK	I don't know what I had envisaged it would be like, the first time I mean. But that wasn't the image I had. I thought there would be more to it. Not that it was unpleasant. After all, I was in bed with a naked woman. She complimented me on my shirt and my hair. She held my penis. I haven't even seen my penis for over thirty years. Anyway, onward. Am I sharing too much?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	No, I'm used to it. Mark is in his iron lung. With his mouth stick, he turns the
M	MARK	"Sometimes the head of the penis may be too large to penetrate the vaginal opening smoothly, in which case the application of lubricant is recommended to avoid possible..." Oh, my God! This time Rod is wheeling Mark. He seems only slightly less
M	ROD	What's on the menu today?
M	MARK	We're attempting intercourse.
M	ROD	Uh-huh. That's a big one.
M	MARK	What do you think of it? Intercourse.
M	ROD	Overrated, but necessary. There's plenty of other ways of achieving the same result, but somehow you don't feel you've actually done it till you've gone all the way in. Cheryl takes off her clothes.
F	CHERYL	I want you to look at me this time. Go on, lift your eyes, look at me.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Do you like watching me undress?
M	MARK	I do.
F	CHERYL	From now on...
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	You're going to start to understand the signals from your body...
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	...and learn how to control... Then suddenly... 43A.
M	MARK	Oh God! Oh God!
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Damn! Shit! Mark is in the side chapel with Father Brendan.
M	MARK	I did it again. This time, I ejaculated on her thigh.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	I felt cursed, that the whole enterprise was cursed. It seemed like a totally just punishment. God wasn't actually denying my sexuality. He was merely pointing out to me how useless it was.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	It's amazing to me how often God is brought into the sex act. I understand that even amongst non- believers, the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is "Oh, God!" Cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed.
F	CHERYL	Okay, I don't want to hear any more about God cursing you. I want the credit. It was my overpowering beauty that did it. It took you by surprise. Now, where were we?
M	MARK	What do you mean, where were we?
F	CHERYL	I'm going to touch you... I'm touching you... and when we both feel you're aroused, then I'm going to guide you into my vagina. Is there anything I need to do?
F	CHERYL	Close your eyes, feel your body, that's all you need to do.
M	MARK	It won't fit. It's not going to fit.
F	CHERYL	No, Mark, it will fit just fine.
M	MARK	No, it's dangerous. It's too big.
F	CHERYL	It's not too big. Relax.
M	MARK	It won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too risky.
F	CHERYL	Please, stop this. I promise you, nothing bad will happen. Now, let's try again while you're still hard.
M	MARK	Shit! Cheryl steps out of the shower. Cheryl gets into bed.
M	MARK	I'm really sorry.
F	CHERYL	Stop being sorry. And stop reading those stupid sex manuals.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	We still have some time. We can talk, which you seem to like, or you can suck on my nipples, which you also seem to like. Or, which one would you like to do first? Cheryl's Volvo is parked in its usual spot out front. There Cheryl is at her desk, dictating her notes. She also has a
F	CHERYL	Mark seemed to be at his most relaxed when I sucked his penis. At the moment he is fixated on penis- vagina and his anxiety is focused around that. The root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion. He believes he doesn't deserve sex. He believes he is responsible for his little sister's death at the age of seven, because his mother was too busy looking after him. A copy of Cheryl's notes comes through on Laura's fax
M	CHERYL (V.O.)	We discussed his fantasies. They are mostly masochistic.
M	CHERYL (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Again, the idea of being punished. He has never seen female genitalia before and seems quite frightened by the idea. Mark and Father Brendan are in the little chapel.
M	MARK	I'm sorry to lay all this on you, Father. My worry now is that it's never going to happen. I'm never going to have intercourse with Cheryl, or any other woman. Maybe intercourse would prove I was an adult. Maybe I don't want to cross that line. Maybe this was a bad idea.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Do you want to know what I think?
M	MARK	Please.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I'd forget the psychobabble. I grew up on a farm. It even takes the animals a few times to get it right. Can I suggest you try and enjoy it more? Don't worry about the technical stuff. You're a poet. Be romantic. Vera wheels Mark and his gurney to a rack in front of the Vera carefully does up the buttons on Mark's new silk shirt.
F	VERA	You nervous?
M	MARK	Only a little.
F	VERA	Would you like a shpritz?
M	MARK	Yes, of course I would.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	I have a good feeling about today, a very good feeling.
F	VERA	Great.
M	MARK	I had a terrible feeling it was never going to happen, but I think today's the day.
F	VERA	Can I make a suggestion?
M	MARK	Please.
F	VERA	Stop thinking about it. Vera wheels Mark up to the front door.
M	MARK	You couldn't have wished for nicer weather.
F	VERA	You're not listening, are you? I said, stop thinking about it.
M	MARK	Beautiful weather. The doorbell rings, amidst a loud background chatter. We
F	CARMEN	Oh, my God, I forgot! Oh, Mark, I'm so sorry. Cheryl, Mark and Vera are by the car. Mark looks grim.
F	VERA	She was very apologetic.
F	CHERYL	Look, it may not be exactly what we had in mind, but I noticed there's quite a nice motel just a couple of blocks from here. Maybe it's worth checking out. Mark and Cheryl wait outside while Vera goes in.
F	VERA	Have you got anything on the ground floor?
M	CLERK	I've got a single.
F	VERA	How much?
M	CLERK	Thirty-five plus tax.
F	VERA	My boss is the gentleman in the gurney.
M	VERA (CONT'D)	He's supposed to be having a therapy session right now, but the facility we normally use had a scheduling mix-up. We only need the room for two hours. Can you do it for twenty cash? The clerk leads them to the room and opens the door.
M	CLERK	There's a soda machine around the corner.
M	MARK	Thanks.
M	CLERK	And an ice machine, if you need it.
M	MARK	I'm sure it'll come in handy. Cheryl, Vera and the gurney enter the room. The clerk watches
F	VERA	Okay, I'll see you. I've got a book to read. I'll just hang around the reception if you need me.
M	MARK	Very atmospheric.
F	CHERYL	Some people find motels exciting.
M	MARK	Do you think I could be one of those people?
F	CHERYL	Another nice shirt.
M	MARK	As in racy and sophisticated?
F	CHERYL	You took the words right out of my mouth. Vera is having coffee with the clerk.
M	CLERK	What's wrong with your boss?
F	VERA	Basically, he can only move his head.
M	CLERK	So what sort of therapy are they doing?
F	VERA	They're having sex.
M	CLERK	You're bullshitting me.
F	VERA	Okay, I'm bullshitting you.
M	CLERK	No, tell me for real, what are they actually doing?
F	VERA	Well, today, after some appropriate foreplay, they're going to try to achieve full penetration. We see Cheryl from the breasts up. We hear violent coughing I'm choking
M	MARK	The mouth-piece.
F	CHERYL	I guess that one's off the menu until further notice.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Come on, lighten up, will you.
M	MARK	Pony girl, Pony girl, Won't you be my pony girl?
M	MARK (CONT'D)	That was what my father used to sing to my little sister, Karin. That was before she died. She was kind of a sad little girl. It didn't do much good. I'm really sorry that the last time I saw her, I fought with her. I made her cry.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	My parents could have left me in the nursing home, you know. They found out the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was 18 months. So they took me home. They gave me a life.
F	CHERYL	Mark, I'm just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee. When I come back, we're going to achieve full penetration. But before I go, I want you to close your eyes.
M	MARK	Is this a game?
F	CHERYL	No, it's not a game. Just do as I say. Close your eyes.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach. Can you do that?
M	MARK	Yes, very easily. The scene has a hazy, dreamlike reality. We see the six-year CHERYL Describe some of your feelings.
M	MARK	I feel very exhilarated, running next to the Atlantic Ocean, feeling the wind and the wet sand between my toes.
F	CHERYL	Do you really feel like him?
M	MARK	Yes, I really feel like him.
F	CHERYL	But can you really picture him?
M	MARK	I don't understand what you mean. I said I can feel like him. Of course I can picture him.
F	CHERYL	From the outside, I mean, as an adult, as you are now, looking at him with his crew cut and his little face?
M	MARK	Yes.
F	CHERYL	And are you mad at him? Do you blame him for getting polio? Was it his fault? 53A. gets up and goes to the bathroom. Mark is obviously Mark has a faraway look.
M	MARK	She either forgot to close the bathroom door, or didn't bother to close it.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	I found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic, and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate. By the time she came back I had a terrific boner. Cheryl gets herself into position on top of Mark.
F	CHERYL	I'm going to rub the tip of your cock around my vulva. When it's ready, I'll guide you in. Breathe slowly and think of something delicious.
M	MARK	Aahh! Vera is still there, reading her book. The clerk looks at his
M	CLERK	They've been in there a long time.
F	VERA	Yes, some people can do that.
M	CLERK	Do you want another coffee?
F	VERA	No thanks.
M	CLERK	Do you live with your parents?
F	VERA	No.
M	CLERK	You at Berkeley?
F	VERA	Uh-huh.
M	CLERK	Doing what?
F	VERA	Architecture.
M	CLERK	You have a boyfriend?
F	VERA	Yes. Do you? Mark and Cheryl are lying together. He has his eyes closed.
F	CHERYL	You awake?
M	MARK	Uh-huh.
F	CHERYL	To answer your earlier question, I grew up in Salem, brought up Catholic, like you, but the church didn't appreciate my attitude towards sex.
M	MARK	You had an attitude towards sex?
F	CHERYL	Yes, I liked it. They like to think they threw me out, but I threw them out. So for years I didn't believe in anything, and now I'm converting to Judaism.
M	MARK	I guess it's good to have some kind of insurance.
F	CHERYL	I didn't think of that. MARK Then why are you doing it? CHERYL My husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies. The idea is, if it makes her happy and him happy, then it will do the same for me. Our son is neutral on the subject, but theoretically, if it looks like it makes me happy, it'll make him happy too. That's the way my husband's family talks, and thinks. The fact that I'm happy already, doesn't seem to be relevant.
M	MARK	What's your son's name?
F	CHERYL	Tony. He's 14 years-old and very smart. You'd like him.
M	MARK	Does he know what you do? 56A.
F	CHERYL	knows I'm a sex therapist. a certificate on the wall. he hasn't had sex yet. So... much can he really know? He's a boy, he's not a man.
M	MARK	much do you want him to know?
F	CHERYL	I want him to have some idea his head. I hope it's a nice
M	MARK	What does your husband do?
F	CHERYL	He's a philosopher.
M	MARK	Wow! You mean, like, at a university?
F	CHERYL	No, in his own mind. He runs the house, plays guitar, thinks a lot.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	It's kind of late.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Hey, we did really good stuff today. You were fantastic. You're a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record. You should be pleased.
M	MARK	Was I really inside you?
F	CHERYL	You were really and truly inside me.
M	MARK	For how long?
F	CHERYL	Five or six seconds.
M	MARK	Is that all?
F	CHERYL	That's a long time for some people. You were pretty excited. I don't know what you were thinking about.
M	MARK	I'm sorry, I couldn't tell one thing from another. It was all a jumble of sensations.
F	CHERYL	Well, you definitely achieved penetration. It was penis-vagina all the way. And you definitely get an A for orgasm.
M	MARK	Did you come?
F	CHERYL	No, Mark, I didn't.
M	MARK	Can we try for that next time?
F	CHERYL	If that's what you want.
M	MARK	Yes, that's what I want.
F	CHERYL	Okay then. Laura is on the phone to Cheryl.
F	LAURA	How's it going? Cheryl is at her desk.
F	CHERYL	He reads too many books. He has it in his head that after meeting three times, we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm. Boom! Just like that. LAURA That's very funny. CHERYL I guess. Yes, it is. What do you think of him? LAURA I said, what do you think of him?
M	CHERYL (V.O.)	I like him. Father Brendan approaches and arrives at the front door. He Mark is in his iron lung. Father Brendan, wearing civilian
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I was in the neighborhood. How are you?
M	MARK	Still exhausted.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	So, on reflection, are you... Fulfilled?
M	MARK	It was okay. I liked some of the other things just as much, or better, but I'm glad it's behind me.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Well, so am I. Congratulations.
M	MARK	When this is all over, I'm going to write an article about it. After all, sex sells. Seriously.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	So you're really doing this for the money.
M	MARK	Absolutely.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Well, that makes me feel much better about the whole thing. Can I ask what she's like? Cheryl. You've never really said anything about her.
M	MARK	She's the most wonderful person on the planet. I'm glad we finally had intercourse, because now I realize that everything I do with her feels just great. As usual, Cheryl's car is out front. Cheryl crawls into bed beside Josh. She lies there with her
M	JOSH	What's on your mind?
F	CHERYL	Oh, nothing.
M	JOSH	Don't believe you.
F	CHERYL	Okay, I've been thinking about the whole conversion thing.
M	JOSH	Still don't believe you.
F	CHERYL	Then, whatever it is, I guess I'm not in the mood for talking.
M	JOSH	What sort of mood are you in?
F	CHERYL	Another sort of mood. Mark is also awake, staring at nothing, his mind full of
M	MARK	So, what do you think? The phone rings. We hear footsteps approaching. Cheryl
F	CHERYL	Hullo, this is Cheryl.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Mark? Mark is in his iron lung.
M	MARK	Can we meet somewhere for a coffee? Somewhere nice. My treat. CHERYL I don't normally meet with clients outside of working hours, you know that. 61A. MARK How could you possibly describe anything to do with me as normal? We don't have to talk about business. A WAITER approaches Cheryl and Mark with two beautifully made
M	MARK	Could you put my cup right on the edge of the table there, and stick the straw in my mouth, please?
M	WAITER	Sure.
M	WAITER (CONT'D)	Is that okay?
M	MARK	Perfect.
M	WAITER	Sir, I'd wait a couple of minutes. That coffee is pretty hot.
M	MARK	Thanks.
M	WAITER	You're welcome.
F	CHERYL	So, what shall we talk about?
M	MARK	We don't have to do much talking.
F	CHERYL	Then why are we here?
M	MARK	I just want to be seen with you in public. I find that as sexy as anything we've done so far.
F	CHERYL	glad you enjoy looking, after
M	MARK	want people to say "Who's the guy the blonde? How did he get so CHERYL so rich.
M	MARK	if some old girlfriend from you hadn't seen for years up suddenly, like right now, would you introduce me? As your
F	CHERYL	as my husband. Why not go all way.
M	MARK	
F	CHERYL	that shock you?
M	MARK	CHERYL I guess it would shock her as
M	MARK	CHERYL old school friend that's going come along any moment.
M	MARK	really can picture me as material?
F	CHERYL	long as we're pretending, sure. MARK you write down your address me, please? 62B.
M	OMITTED 113A	Josh walks unhurriedly to the letter box at the front gate Cheryl and Josh are in the kitchen, arguing.
M	JOSH	You said yourself, it's not supposed to get personal.
F	CHERYL	That's another thing altogether. What I want to know is where do you get off opening my mail?
M	JOSH	It was scented. I assumed it was just junk mail.
F	CHERYL	Even less reason to open it. Where is it? Give it to me.
M	JOSH	You're not getting it.
F	CHERYL	This is absolutely none of your fucking business.
M	JOSH	You're still not getting it. I threw it out.
F	CHERYL	You didn't.
M	JOSH	I fucking did.
M	TONY	What's up?
M	JOSH	Would you please ask your mother to pass the salt?
M	TONY	Cheryl, would you please pass the salt? Cheryl is at the dining table, with her recorder and file in
F	CHERYL	Mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behaviour. This is not unusual after first successful intercourse, but I think he is especially susceptible. He cannot help seeing me as the multi- functional, all-purpose woman, mother, sister, schoolmistress, whore, lover and best friend. At the same time, his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished. Josh crawls into bed with Cheryl. She is still awake. He
M	JOSH	I'm sorry. I really upset you before.
F	CHERYL	No, you didn't. I'm fine.
M	JOSH	You sure?
F	CHERYL	Yes, I promise.
M	JOSH	Really? 64A. Yes, I've come around to your point of view. You were right. You're generally right about these things.
M	JOSH	It was quite a nice poem. I mean, nothing astounding, but heartfelt, at least.
F	CHERYL	Josh, I need to go to sleep. Everything's good.
M	JOSH	Okay. Good night. Cheryl rummages around in the kitchen garbage. She finds Cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard. Holding the
F	CHERYL	Let me touch you with my words. For my hands lie limp as empty gloves.
M	OMITTED 120	From behind, we see Vera wheeling Mark in his gurney. ANOTHER
M	MARK	Do you think she'll like the shirt?
F	AMANDA	I like it. Does that count?
M	MARK	Amanda? They are stopped at a park bench. Vera is hovering in the
M	MARK	It's been a while.
F	AMANDA	I know. I'm sorry. I'm going to Germany. I wanted to say goodbye to you before I left.
M	MARK	Why are you going to Germany?
F	AMANDA	To study German.
M	MARK	For how long?
F	AMANDA	One or two years maybe. But we should keep in touch.
M	MARK	But why go to Germany? It's the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden.
F	AMANDA	You could always make me laugh. I love you, Mark. I really do.
M	MARK	Really? MARK Yes, I love you, but not in that way. I love you, but I'm not in love with you. Blah, blah, blah. You know how it goes. AMANDA I think it's great what you're doing with this surrogate lady.
M	MARK	It could have been you.
F	AMANDA	It could have been, but it wasn't. MARK I had this faint hope that she would show the merest hint of jealousy. It shows you how naïve I am. The fact that I was no longer a virgin, that I was a `made man', so to speak, made no difference to her at all. Cheryl's car is in the parking lot. We see her draw the Clerk takes two beers from a mini-bar and hands one to Vera.
F	VERA	Thanks.
M	CLERK	You want to go out some time?
F	VERA	No, I don't think so.
M	CLERK	What, your boyfriend?
F	VERA	No.
M	CLERK	Your parents?
F	VERA	No, I'm busy, that's all. What's wrong with this, anyway? We're having a nice time, aren't we?
M	CLERK	It's okay.
F	VERA	Or do you have things to do? I can go for a walk if you're busy and come back later.
M	CLERK	No, no, stay. Is this going to be a regular thing?
F	VERA	What?
M	CLERK	The therapy.
F	VERA	I don't know. I'm not the therapist.
M	CLERK	What sort of a therapist is she, really?
F	VERA	I told you the first time, she's a sex therapist.
M	VERA (CONT'D)	Today they're working on simultaneous orgasm.
M	CLERK	What's that? Mark and Cheryl are in bed, their faces close.
M	MARK	Boy, am I glad to see you.
F	CHERYL	Don't you say that to all the girls?
M	MARK	Yes, but I always mean it. Remember about the breathing. Concentrate on breathing out rather than in. Think of anything neutral. Sky, water, trees, ships, music, nothing too dramatic. MARK The first time, I really didn't know what was going on. Technically it all happened, but nothing really happened in my head. This time it did, and my head has never experienced anything like it before. Of course, I ignored Cheryl's advice about having neutral thoughts. Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete Mark opens his eyes and looks up at Cheryl. She seems divine. The expression of elation on Mark's face morphs dramatically
M	MARK	Then afterwards, there was this moment, this glimpse of an awful sadness to come. The Volvo is parked out front. The envelope is still on the Cheryl is dictating.
F	CHERYL	Mark achieved an erection as soon as I started to suck on him. He did the controlled breathing, as I had suggested, and I was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily. We see Mark's face from Cheryl's POV. His eyes are still
M	MARK	Is it in? Is it really in?
F	CHERYL	Yes, it's really in.
M	MARK (V.0.)	I couldn't believe it. Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we
M	MARK (V.O.)	I was finally there. Too soon, I came. But she kept holding me inside her. Then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face... We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we ... as though an all-day itch were finally being scratched. Letting me go, she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders and kissed my chest. This act of affection moved me deeply. Mark is with Father Brendan.
M	MARK	I almost wept. No-one had ever kissed me there before. It was so unexpected and so natural. Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on
M	MARK	I love you.
F	CHERYL	I love you, too.
M	MARK	Did you come?
F	CHERYL	Yes. Cheryl continues dictating.
F	CHERYL	Mark is breathing well and learning to pace himself. There is no real physical impediment to a variety of sexual activities, given the right sort of partner. His deeper emotional needs are outside the scope of my potential involvement.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	As anticipated, this was the final session. They are still in the same intimate position.
M	MARK	
F	CHERYL	happens when what?
M	MARK	people become attached to each
F	CHERYL	people?
M	MARK	people. What's the chemistry it all? When people are to each other.
F	CHERYL	you attracted to me?
M	MARK	just talking hypothetically.
F	CHERYL	they write poems, have sex. what happens next?
F	CHERYL	poetry and sex? Nothing or The rest is by as it were.
M	MARK	do you mean?
F	CHERYL	mean, you can just leave it at and attraction, or you can things complicated. As most do.
M	MARK	you?
F	CHERYL	yes. The clerk looks bored. Vera looks at the time. She seems a
F	VERA	Can I use that phone to call the room?
M	CLERK	Sure. The phone rings, Cheryl picks it up.
F	CHERYL	What shall we do next time? Any requests?
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	Mark?
M	MARK	I'm thinking.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	We have two sessions left, is that correct?
F	CHERYL	That's right. Or...
M	MARK	Or, what?
F	CHERYL	Or, we could stop now.
M	MARK	You mean, make this the last session?
F	CHERYL	Yes.
M	MARK	What do you think we should do?
F	CHERYL	It's not we, it's you, Mark. It's up to you.
M	MARK	I want to know how you feel.
F	CHERYL	That doesn't come in to it.
M	MARK	Yes, it does. I don't just write poems to anyone.
F	CHERYL	Mark, what do you want me to say? How much I was touched by that? How special this has been to me? Is that going to help you? No, it's going to make things worse.
M	MARK	You mean to say, come the sixth session that will be it?
F	CHERYL	Yes, that will be it. I explained that the first time we met.
M	CHERYL (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, it's also hard for me to think about it.
M	MARK	Then maybe we should pull the plug now.
F	CHERYL	I think maybe we should. It's only going to get harder. I guess you might as well save the money. Maybe buy yourself a nice futon.
M	LITTLE LATER.	Just a moment.
M	MARK (V.O.)	I desperately wanted to feel that because of Cheryl, my life had changed. But it hadn't.
F	CHERYL	Bye, Mark Bye.
F	VERA	Everything all right?
F	CHERYL	He did great. See you. I'm sorry, I have to run.
F	VERA	See you. Cheryl goes to her car and opens the trunk. As she is putting
F	VERA	You forgot this.
F	CHERYL	I knew there was a reason I came here today. Vera wheels Mark home. They travel in silence. Father Brendan and Mark are together in the chapel.
M	MARK	I felt I'd just been through a ceremony that I didn't know the meaning of. I kept thinking, is that all there is? Just an empty hole at the end of it? A bigger hole than there was before?
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I'm sorry Mark, you can't always trust your feelings. You've achieved a great thing. It may take you a while to realize that. It is a moonlit night. On the opposite wall from the Virgin
M	MARK (V.O.)	I wrote letters to Amanda in Germany. Five, six pages long A year passed, Heard nothing. Was it my fault? Of course it was. But the guilt isn't enough to patch over the rage. I pound the insides of my mind with words, such puny fists, And nobody hears. There is an answering machine on a bedside table.
M	ROD'S VOICE	Hi, this is Rod. Leave a message, or not. Rod, it's Mark. I need help. The power's gone out, including the pump on the iron lung. I'd say I've got about three hours before I start to turn blue. I hope you get this in time. Mark winces in frustration.
M	MARK	Okay... nine-one-one.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	Shit!
M	MARK (CONT'D)	So this is how it ends. Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe.
M	MIKVAH LADY	Is this your first time?
F	CHERYL	Yes, it is. I'm converting.
M	MIKVAH LADY	So, what do you do?
F	CHERYL	I don't think you'd understand.
M	MIKVAH LADY	You can try me.
F	CHERYL	Okay. I'm a housewife.
M	MIKVAH LADY	Why shouldn't I understand?
F	CHERYL	I guess I was mistaken.
M	MIKVAH LADY	I see you're very comfortable with being naked.
F	CHERYL	That has never been one of my problems.
M	MIKVAH LADY	Sometimes new brides come with their mothers. Do I have to take this off? Can I please leave this on? They've never been naked before. No honey, it all has to come off.
F	CHERYL	And it does?
M	MIKVAH LADY	And it does. They stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves. Nothing to hide behind. This is your body. This is the body that God crafted for you.
M	MIKVAH LADY (CONT'D)	Immerse completely. Go completely under the water, without touching the walls or anything.
M	CHERYL (V.O.)	Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now. Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes.
M	CHERYL (V.O.)	This is your body.
M	MARK (V.O.)	So this is the body that someone was able to love. Not quite as bad as I thought. Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the
M	VOICE	Mark, can you hear me? Open your eyes. Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic
F	SUSAN	They'll be letting you go today. Whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged, so you'll have at least one back-up system.
M	MARK	How close was I?
F	SUSAN	To what?
M	MARK	You know, to that tunnel thing and the light, and the voice saying don't go near the light.
F	SUSAN	Is that what you remember?
M	MARK	No. I assume I passed out. Before that, I remember feeling sorry for myself.
F	SUSAN	Do you feel relieved now?
M	MARK	No. I mean, I'm relieved that Rod got to me in time, but I still feel sorry for myself.
F	SUSAN	I'm sure there's a cure for that. Would you like to talk to someone?
M	MARK	I feel comfortable talking to you.
F	SUSAN	I'm only a volunteer, not a therapist. I can refer you to someone if you like.
M	MARK	I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude. I'm just smiling at the idea that a therapist could do anything useful for me right now. My priest couldn't.
F	SUSAN	Are you religious?
M	MARK	Yes. I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this. Are you?
F	SUSAN	No, I don't go to any church and I don't think about God very much. But I believe there's a mysterious logic, or poetry to life. I guess that makes me a spiritual type.
M	MARK	Yes, that would count.
F	SUSAN	Would you like me to visit you?
M	MARK	Are you married?
F	SUSAN	No.
M	MARK	Do you have a steady boyfriend?
F	SUSAN	No.
M	MARK	Then please visit as often as you can. She smiles. Mark is loaded into an ambulance.
F	SUSAN	Bye. Take care.
M	MARK	There's just one more thing I want to tell you.
M	MARK (CONT'D)	I'm not a virgin.
F	SUSAN	So, are you in a relationship at the moment?
M	MARK	No, it was a passing thing.
F	SUSAN	Thanks for sharing that with me. Mark is accompanied by an AMBULANCE OFFICER. We see clear
M	AMBULANCE OFFICER	Nice day, isn't it?
M	MARK	The best.
M	AMBULANCE OFFICER	Good to be alive, huh? We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of
M	MARK (V.O.)	I met Susan five years before I died. She was the love of my life. We had the same priorities, baseball pretty much came first, and we wrote each other mushy poems. I never expected it, nor did she, but that's often the way things turn out. Rod shows Father Brendan into Mark's room.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	That was quite something. What do you propose to do for an encore?
M	MARK	Yep, I almost found out the big secret. But here I am, back with the living. If there is another place, then I think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	And welcome back.
M	MARK	And thank you for coming to visit.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I know it's been awhile since we talked about this... About Cheryl. At the time, you seemed to feel so badly about her... or about it?
M	MARK	I no longer feel like that.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Oh? That's good to hear. In the end, you're glad that you did it?
M	MARK	Yes, I am. In fact, at this point in time, I feel very blessed.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Blessed?
M	MARK	Yes, blessed. They put me on this new anti-depressant and now I can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view. It takes about six weeks to kick in, but when it does, you can really tell the difference.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Hey, that's great.
M	MARK	I'm pulling your leg, Father. I'm not on drugs. I have a girlfriend.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	You're kidding me. A real girlfriend?
M	MARK	A very real girlfriend. She adores me. She'll do anything for me. And I can get pretty kinky sometimes, believe you me. Her name is Susan.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	I'm flabbergasted. Is she pretty?
M	MARK	She sure is.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Has she got a sister?
M	MARK	As a matter of fact... FATHER BRENDAN I'm kidding.
M	MARK	No, you're not. Anyway, we're starting a publishing company together.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	Here I was, all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn - that's supposed to be my specialty - and now I can just throw away that little speech.
M	MARK	No, no. Please make the little speech. I'd love to hear it. 89A.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	but I'll try and keep it
M	MARK	make it too short.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	fine. Here goes. The meaning love. Love is a journey.
M	MARK	I already like it.
M	FATHER BRENDAN	That's it. That's all of I've got. I told you it's short. Love is a journey. Father Brendan lets himself out and walks back the way he Mark also has a smile on his face as he lies awake.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Actually, I was on drugs, I was taking anti-depressants and they were helping a bit. At least I was able to see the cup-of-life metaphor as a useful tool. Of course, the two halves were never even. Not in my case, that's for sure. Look at all the years of unendurable crap I've had to put up with. That fills most of the cup. But in the little bit that's left, what do I have to show for myself? Journalism? Poetry? At the very least, three beautiful women who all loved me and will all show up at my funeral. Josh saunters out to the mail box. He retrieves the mail, Cheryl is planting stuff in the back yard. Josh approaches
M	JOSH	It's from a Susan Fernbach. 90A. She takes it and opens it uncertainly, somehow anticipating A full-blown Catholic funeral is happening. Meaningful hugs
M	MARK (V.O.)	Three Reasons to Live
M	The mundane:	O God, it was boring, but I did it got it out of the way
M	The transcendent:	We had this agreement -- God gave me life for a while I gave Him gratitude for a while and it worked out OK You know how every day is different? I just wanted to see what would happen next Father Brendan delivers a eulogy. We see members of Mark's
M	FATHER BRENDAN (TO MARK)	Mark, I know you're watching. I'm sorry, my friend, but we have to do this. Just bear with me, and I think you might like it. I've been branching out lately, reading Native American stories about the character of the trickster. Sometimes he shows up as a coyote, sometimes as a raven, but he always does the unexpected. The trickster breaks the rules. Mark O'Brien, whose life we're celebrating today, was very much the trickster -- anyone who knew him knew that. 90B.
M	FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)	his irreverent humor and honesty, he always did the
M	nearly every aspect of his life,	did the unexpected. His was a voice in a paralyzed body, full life lived long after he have been dead. He from college, wrote and articles and poems, and -- all odds, by his own -- entered into the fully experience of physical love. to day, from breath to breath breath, for 49 years. He loved, he was loved and in his quiet he spoke loud truths.
M	FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Susan Fernbach will now read one of Mark's favorite poems.
M	SUSAN (V.O.)	This is called Love Poem for No One in Particular.
F	SUSAN	Let me touch you with my words. For my hands lie limp as empty gloves. Let my words stroke your hair, Slide down your back and tickle your belly. For my hands, light and free-flying as bricks, Ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse to carry out my quietest desires.
M	SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Let my words enter your mind, bearing torches. Admit them willingly into your being So they may caress you gently within. In the middle of the room, moonlit, is Mark's iron lung,
