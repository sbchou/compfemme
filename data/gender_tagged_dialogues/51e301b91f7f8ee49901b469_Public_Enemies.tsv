M	PIERPONT	okay...?

M	THE WOMAN	brings out the dozen fried egg sandwiches wrapped in

M	EDWIN NORRIS (CONT'D)	Can't change that...
M	DILLINGER	Well, then you keep the change. $12 is a lot'--'of money in 1933. Grateful, Norris goes inside, Take me with you, mister. She puts a hand on his forearm.
M	DILLINGER	I'm sorry, honey. Pierpont, Homer and Makley head towards the Plymouth.

M	PURVIS	Melvin Purvis - Department of Investigation. Where's your friend Harry Campbell, Floyd?
M	FLOYD	Ain't gonna tell you shit. Floyd looks at the sky.
M	FLOYD (CONT'D)	And I believe you have killed me. So you can go and rot in hell, you sonofabitch. He lapses, goes cold and dies.

M	CAROLE	Johnny! Dillinger cradles the Thompson in his arm and crosses to her.
M	DILLINGER	Hey, Red, call Oscar.
F	HAMILTON	Okay. And Berman? Wanna switch-out the "shorts"? Get a Chrysler and an Essex. Hey, doll... He half picks her up with one arm around her waist.
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	You get a hold of Zarkovich...?
M	CAROLE	I sure did... Put me down!

M	DILLINGER	And it rides up and to the right on full auto.
M	OSCAR	I widen port... Dillinger rises as a 1933 Chrysler and an Essex Terraplane drive in. Out of the Essex steps HARRY BERMAN, a Cicero,
M	PIERPONT	Hiya Harry...
M	PIERPONT	tosses Berman a rubber banded roll of bills while...
M	ZARKOVIOH	Johnny! How are ya? With him is ANNA SAGE, a 40 year old well-dressed madam. She
M	DILLINGER	Good and so are you. Christmas is coming early this year. Extra cake's in here for you and Anna. Still in Hammond, doll?
M	ANNA SAGE	I'm in Chicago on North Halstead now. Come on by...

M	DILLINGER	I want to sit here with you and listen to the radio, baby. I have missed you like nobody's business... John Dillinger seems like a romantic husband with his little
M	MCKELLAR	Why do we need this?
M	HOOVER	Because of the new breed of mobile outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing state lines over highways and against whom this government must wage a war on crime. J. EDGAR HOOVER is a physically short man but has a dynamic SUYDAM and TOLSON sit next to him. MCKELLAR iï¿½'Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Sub-
M	MCKELLAR	And so in the middle of a Great Depression you're looking for a budget increase to build up your Department? But by my tally your Department of Investigation spends more taxpayer's dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place...
M	HOOVER	That's ridiculous. The Bureau's apprehended kidnappers, bank robbers, who have stolen up to...
M	MCKELLAR	How many criminals you apprehended?
M	HOOVER	We've arrested and arraigned 213 wanted felons...
M	MCKELLAR	No. I mean you. How many?
M	HOOVER	As Director I've administered...
M	MCKELLAR	No. How many have you arrested? Personally.
M	HOOVER	I've never arrested anybody. You never arrested anybody?
M	HOOVER	I'm an administrator.
M	MCKELLAR	With no field experience. For once Hoover is silent. In fact you are shockingly unqualified, aren't you, sir? You have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life= Others in the room stare at Hoover. McKellar leans'-back... I think you are a front. I think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there. You are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as its Czar. That is runnin' wild in my estimation...
M	HOOVER	Crime is what runs wild in this country, Mr. Chairman. And...
M	MCKELLAR	And if the country required an expanded Bureau, I question you are the person most fit to run it while... I won't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians...
M	MCKELLAR	While outlaws like Dillinger, Clyde Barrow, the Barkers, and Nelson flourish unabated. Your appropriation request is denied. The hearing's over.
M	HOOVER	Find out: was he soft on the Reds in ,1919? Does he use prostitutes? Peppy `tuf f like that. And feed this to Walter =!riiâinchell: "McKellar's a Neanderthal. He's O7:a personal vendetta to destroy me." Like that. We'll fight him on the front page. Not in his damn committee room... Where's Dillinger?
M	TOLSON	Spotted in Hammond, Indiana.
M	HOOVER	How long ago?
M	TOLSON	Yesterday. Another sighting has him on the Lincoln Highway in Ohio heading towards Cincinnati. He's in Hammond. Heading to Chicago.
M	SUYDAM	How do you know?
M	HOOVER	You can have fun in Chicago. What the hell's there to do in Cincinnati?
M	HOOVER	Agent Purvis, congratulations.
M	PURVIS	Thank you sir. May I ask why?
M	HOOVER	Pretty Boy Floyd, for which you have my commendation and personal gratitude. Second, you are, as of this moment, the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office. Your task will be to get John Dillinger. Are you up to it?
M	PURVIS	Absolutely, sir. Purvis is imbued. Henry Suydam enters.
M	SUYDAM	They're ready for him. This is Henry Suydam.. He is our expert in congressional and press relations.
M	THE OPEN PLAN OFFICE	Tolson + Suydam follow. It's like the "Corporate Office of the Future" designed by
M	TOLSON	hurry down the staircase. Why are you sure you're up to this task, Mr. Purvis?
M	PURVIS	We have two weapons that cannot be defeated.
M	HOOVER	What are they?
M	PURVIS	The Bureau's modern techniques of investigation and your visionary leadership.
M	HOOVER	You let Mr. Tolson, here, know if you need anything, Melvin, anything at all,
M	PURVIS	Thank you.

M	DILLINGER	Okay. Beat it! Three hostages jump off. Dillinger pulls Anna Patzke and
M	DILLINGER	sees Anna Patzke's shivering from shock and the cold. He puts
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	Something to remember me by. She laughs, nervously, and a little thrilled at being where Are we taking `em to the hideout?
M	DILLINGER	That depends.
M	VAN METER	How 'bout it, honey? Can you cook?
M	ANNA PATZKE	Uh. Sure... After a fashion. They start to hoot and laugh. They think this is hÂ±l iiou.s.
M	ANNA PATZKE (CONT'D)	Well, its true!
M	VAN METER	When I'm not doing this, I'm a scout for the movies.
M	ANNA PATZKE	Really? This makes them laugh even harder.
M	PIERPONT	Face each other. Join hands. Pierpont binds them loosely to the tree.
M	WEYLAND	We'll freeze.
M	DILLINGER	You'll worm your way out of that in about ten minutes. Anna looks over at Dellinger.
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	It's okay, doll. You're just gonna be a little late for dinner. Dillinger reaches over, snatches his hat off Anna Patzke's

M	PURVIS	Then we will cross-reference every Dillinger family member and known associate in each locale. He was there. It got cold. He bought a coat. Therefore, he may have been harbored or have a safe house nearby.
M	PURVIS (CONT`D)	By such techniques we will get Dillinger. Doris... For those of you who haven't met her, Miss Rogers is my secretary... Please contact the Chicago telephone exchange supervisors. Request appointments for Carter Baum or myself. We are going to be working long hours. It will be dangerous. Those of you who aren't prepared for that, can go. And if you're going to go, go now. Thank you, gentlemen. He's expecting someone. Then, Dillinger sees her again: jet
M	BILLIE FRECHETTE (27).	She feels the stare and looks over. She studies him, then Dillinger's with Pierpont, Makley and Hamilton at a table. It
M	DILLINGER	Hiya, Alvin. You hungry? How's Freddie and Dock? Freddie and Dock Barker are the sons of Ma Barker. After the
M	KARPIS	Everyone's good. We been looking to snatch two fellas. One's a St. Paul banker, Ed Bremer. Need a few more hands.
M	DILLINGER	Don't like kidnapping.
M	KARPIS	Robbing banks is getting tougher.
M	DILLINGER	The public don't like kidnappers.
M	KARPIS	Who gives a damn what the public likes?
M	DILLINGER	I do. I hide out among them. ,L -am strictly out to make cake.
M	DILLINGER	.: yeah, then you, Ma, Dock and Freddie hole up like hermits on farms for six months. I grew up on a goddamn farm. I hate farms. I like big cities, crowds and a good time... Well, we got a mail train we been lookin' at, too.
M	DILLINGER	Say, by the way, if someone got pinched here, who can get'em out real fast?
M	KARPIS	Lawyer named Piquett. We all use him.
M	DILLINGER	What about this train?..
M	KARPIS	Needs two, three more months to set up. I need seven or eight real right guys to take it down. Sounds like Jesse James. A million seven, a million eight. Dillinger looks at Karpis. In 2007, that would be $22 Federal Reserve shipment. It runs only twice a month. This is the kind of score you go away on after.
M	DILLINGER	Where you gonna go?
M	KARPIS	Brazil. Cuba, maybe. What about you?
M	DILLINGER	Were having too good a time today. We ain't worryin' about tomorrow yet...
M	KARPIS	You ought to. What we're doin' here, don't last forever. They lock at each other: two pros at the top of their game.
M	DILLINGER	Keep me in mind on the train. Karpis leaves. Dellinger can't see Billie anymore. Let's snatch Bremer... Know how much they made snatchin' that Hamm Brewery guy? $250,000. Dillinger looks at Pierpont.
M	P IERPONT	Shut your yap, Homer.
M	MAKLEY	Let's get our of here. Pierpont, Homer and Makley leave.
M	DILLINGER	Homer stayin' steady?
F	HAMILTON	He's okay.
M	DILLINGER	Three rules I learned from Walter Dietrich. One: never work with people who are desperate. Two: never work with people who aren't the best. Three: never work when you're not ready. Billie reappears, dancing with a young man.
F	HAMILTON	Well, I got rule four: stay away from women.
M	DILLINGER	Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.
F	HAMILTON	What's why they invented whores. Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his
M	DILLINGER	I don't know what you said to your friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a What's your name?
F	BILLIE	Billie Frechette.
M	DILLINGER	Buy you a drink? Billie looks at her girlfriend, she nods, Billie rises...
M	DILLINGER (CONT'B)	Is that French?
F	BILLIE	On my father's side. There's an "e" at the end. Do you have a name?
M	DILLINGER	Jack Harris. Music changes to "Bye Bye Blackbird."
F	BILLIE	Do you dance, Jack?
M	DILLINGER	I don't know how. She smiles a pretty smile at him.
F	BILLIE	How come you don't know how to dance? Its easy. Follow me. This is a two-step. Don't look at my feet. Look at my shoulders. She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and âPack-up all my cares and woe Here I go, singing low Bye, bye blackbird"
M	DILLINGER	My, but you are pretty. They look into each other's eyes. He pulls her closer, wants

F	BILLIE	Flandreau.
M	DILLINGER	Where's Flandreau.? "Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet, so is she Bye, bye blackbird..."
F	BILLIE	outh Dakota.
M	DILLINGER	Father's French, what's on the other side?
F	BILLIE	Italian.
M	DILLINGER	From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than Italian. She looks at him.
F	BILLIE	My momma's a Menominee Indian. But most men don't like that...
M	DILLINGER	I'm not most men.
F	BILLIE	And I check coats at the Steuben Club. What do you do, Jack?
M	DILLINGER	I'm catching up.
F	BILLIE	Catching up on what?
M	DILLINGER	On life, meeting someone like you. Dark, beautiful, like the black bird in that song... She laughs at the flattery. Holds his eyes a beat with an
M	DILLINGER (CONT`D)	Say, how'd you like some dinner?
F	BILLIE	Sure. He nods courteously to her girlfriends, grabs her coat, puts "So make my bed and light the light Cause I'll be home late tonight Bye, bye blackbird... ." Then he turns and he kisses her hard on the lips. She didn't At last they separate.. .and look at each other for a beat.
M	DILLINGER	What are you gonna have?
M	CONTINUED:	Billie stares at him, ignoring her menu.
F	BILLIE	What is it, exactly, you do for a living? Dillinger looks over the top of his menu.
M	DILLINGER	Well...I rob banks. Then he leans back in his chair and regards her.
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	That's where all these people here put their money.
F	BILLIE	Why'd you tell me that? You could have made up a story...
M	DILLINGER	'Cause I can't lie to you. she studies him carefully.
F	BILLIE	;,;.at's a pretty serious thing to say to a woman you just met.
M	DILLINGER	I feel like I know you.
F	BILLIE	Well, I haven't been any of the places you've been. So I don't even know what I don't know.
M	DILLINGER	Some of the places I been ain't so hot. Where I'm going is a lot better. Wanna come along?
F	BILLIE	Boy, you are in a hurry.
M	DILLINGER	If you were looking at what I am looking at, honey, you'd be in a hurry too. She laughs at his flattery, which she is also finding
F	BILLIE	Well, its me they're looking at this time.
M	DILLINGER	That's 'cause you're beautiful. A blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a
F	BILLIE	That's nice. But they're looking at me because they're not used to having a Menominee Indian girl in their restaurant in a three dollar dress.
M	DILLINGER	Listen, doll, that's 'cause they're all about where people come from. Only thing important is where somebody's going.
F	BILLIE	Where are you going?
M	DILLINGER	To the top. He's irresistible.
M	DILLINGER (COIN' D)	Let's get out of here. Beat. She nods. They get up, get their things. Hey Johnny...: Dillinger reacts, changes down, says coldly...
M	DILLINGER	Go wait outside. I'll be right there. Billie turns and walks out of the restaurant.
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	How you been, Gil?
M	CATENA	Real good. I work for Mr. Nitti now. Been with him since I got out of Michigan... Catena indicates FRANK NITTI (47) in a group at a table.
M	DILLINGER	Looks like a barber.
M	CATENA	Don't go by looks. He's real smart. We're connected to everybody all over the country now... From Nitti's table a man gets up and walks straight towards
M	D'ANDREA	Everytime I read about one of your jobs, where you give people back their money, 'You crack me up... Ypu need anything, Gilbert knows how to find me. D'Andrea continues to the men's room.
M	DILLINGER	See you. Gilbert...
M	CATENA	Good luck Johnnie.
M	BAUM	That noise on the line? That's called "swing". Nothing we can do about it. Some words get dropped. Were listening in on a car dealer. Harry Berman. Rice plays back a recording.
M	VOICE (V.0.)	When you drop it, leave the keys on the floorboard. I got a DeSoto.
M	VOICE (V.0.)	okay.
M	BERMAN (V.0.)	The interior's no good.
M	VOICE (V.0.)	Don't matter. It's a work. car.
M	BAUM	We think that's Dillinger's voice.
M	PURVIS	How did we find Berman?
M	BAUM	Dillinger's coat was bought in Cicero, Illinois, a few doors from Berman's dealership. Berman supplies cars to the syndicate. Since Capone. Dillinger must have been at Berman's switching cars when he bought that coat. Soon as they call to switch out the next car, we will tail them. Right to Dillinger. TWO MEN approach. Billie checks their hats and coats. To
F	BILLIE	May I check your coat, sir?
M	DILLINGER	No, honey. You go get your coat. She looks up. So does May. May flashes Billie a look: if you
M	MAY MINCZELES	Sounds good to me. Dillinger has eyes only for Billie.
M	DILLINGER	You ran out on me.
F	BILLIE	`you left me standing alone on the sidewalk.
M	DILLINGER	I 'you're going to be my girl, you have swear you'll never do that again.
F	BILLIE	I'm not your girl! A CUSTOMER comes up and puts his ticket on the counter.
M	CUSTOMER	Brown overcoat.
F	BILLIE	I am not your girl and I'm not going to say that.
M	DILLINGER	I'm waiting.
M	CUSTOMER	So am I.
M	DILLINGER.	"I am not ever going to run out on you again." Say it.
F	BILLIE	No.
M	DILLINGER	Well, I will never run out on you. And that's a promise.
M	CUSTOMER	Well, I want to run out of here. So, lady, will you get my coat...? Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him
M	DILLINGER	Keep the tip. You ain't getting other people's hats and coats no more either. He takes her coat and holds it for her. She doesn't move.
F	BILLIE	No one's ever done that for me before.
M	DILLINGER	You're with me now.
F	BILLIE	I don't know anything about you.
M	DILLINGER	I was raised on a farm in Mooresville, Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me because he didn't know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb things but I'm a lot smarter now. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, and you. What else do you need to know? She gets into her coat. Dillinger opens the door for her. He goes into a closet to get two Marshall Fields boxes and
F	BILLIE	You been living here long?
M	DILLINGER	Yeah. Since yesterday. From a back bedroom (Red's) a phonograph is louder as a door
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	I got something for you. What's wrong? Open it up. Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out a sleeveless dress in

We don't go lookin' to hurt anybody. But if somebody gets in our way, that's gotta be their problem. That what you want to know?
F	BILLIE	I'm trying to get to know you.

F	BILLIE	You're all packed.
M	DILLINGER	Always are. Ready to get up and go in a heartbeat... She stands next to him in the bed now. He pulls her down next
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	What's wrong with the other ear?
F	BILLIE	I was married once. He was too handy with his fists. She stares at Dillinger. Will this put him off.
M	DILLINGER	Where's he now?
F	BILLIE	In prison. I divorced him. Only mistake I made was marrying him in the first place. He got caught mugging a mailman...
M	DILLINGER	A criminal mastermind... She turns over and puts her mouth next to his ear. It gets
F	BILLIE	After my daddy died, we went to live on the reservation in Flandreau. In Flandreau nothin' ever happened. When I was 13, we went to live with my Aunt Ines in Milwaukee where my cousin Frances had a lot of Indian friends who went around to churches and put on plays like "Little Fireface." And nothing exciting ever happened to me there, either. So I haven't been anywhere or done anything in my whole life except come to Chicago and try to make my way.
M	DILLINGER	Well baby-you're going to start a new and exciting kind of life from right now. And as they're pulled to each other and start making love

M	PURVIS	What's your fiance's name?
M	VI SCOTT	Leonard... McHenry.
M	PURVIS	May we come in?
M	VI SCOTT	Sure. I'm perfectly safe... But come on in. She holds the door open.
M	LEONARD	Something wrong?
M	PURVIS	You have identification?
M	LEONARD	Honey, would you get my driver's licence. It's in my coat pocket. Leonard sums reluctant to get up. With his right hand, he Who is this man?
M	LEONARD (CONTÂ°D)	You're that.. .Melvin Purvis. I've seen your picture!
M	PURVIS	What do you do for a living, Leonard?
M	LEONARD	I travel in ladies shoes. He smiles at his joke. Vi enters with his wallet. Barton sees
M	LEONARD (CONT'D)	Show him, honey. Vi Scott puts a foot forward - a red shoe with a bow.
M	PURVIS	Do you carry around samples?
M	LEONARD	Sure. Big suitcases.
M	PURVIS	Enjoy the rest of your dinner, Mr. McHenry.
M	LEONARD	Thanks. Its all wrong. No one in or out. I'll get the others. Stay here, watch that door from right here. Purvis leaves. Barton wants to do it right. Then, he hears
M	PING!	Behind him, the elevator doors open. Barton turns hi.,,back on
M	TOMMY CARROLL (38)	a flat-nosed ex-con enters. He looks curiously at Barton.
M	BARTON	Bureau of Investigation. What's your name?
M	CARROLL	You wanna know my name? Barton sees Carroll's eyes flicker, slight smile. He spins...
M	AN INDIFFERENT "BABY FACE" NELSON	Barton's slammed forward. Nelson looks at Barton, prostrate,
M	PURVIS	Pull the men from Sheridan and Wilson.
M	PURVIS	-reacting- grabs the Thompson from Madala and runs
M	BARTON	in the final moments of his life. Barton looks up into Purvis does not know what to do. Then Barton's eyes drift Purvis impels himself to action. He kicks in the door to Apt.
M	PURVIS	Where is he?!
M	BABY FACE NELSON + TOMMY CARROLL	quickly cross the alley from the back stairs to the Desoto.
M	PURVIS	They headed north! The Sheridan Road car?
M	RICE	That's us. We heard gunfire. So we. .came here. They're fucked.
M	MADALA	Was it Dillinger?
M	BAUM	No. It was Lester Gillis. Purvis sinks.
M	PURVIS	The man we let get away wasn't John Dillinger. It was Baby Face Nelson. wearing overcoats and hats with guns tucked inside, all walk
M	PIERPONT	Change a. twenty? Teller looks up at Pierpont but is staring into the 45 cal.
M	DILLINGER	vaults the five foot divider railing and trains two 45s on
M	DILLINGER	Get over to the vault! Everybody! Go on! He herds the tellers over. Pierpont makes customers sit in the detailed map of their getaway route.
M	HOMER	on Lookout watches the street. Nothing. Dillinger and
M	HOOVER	That was a miserable piece of work.
M	PURVIS	Yes, it was. I take full responsibility, sir. Hoover calms for a moment.
M	PURVIS (CONT'D)	And I'd like to request we hire part time agents with "special qualifications"... from outside the Bureau.
M	HOOVER	I thought you understood what I am doing...build.ing a department of professional investigators. Young college men with law or accounting degrees from good families. No, you may not go outside the Bureau, Purvis.
M	PURVIS	The Bureau has used these men before.
M	HOOVER	They are not our "type." Our "type" cannot get the job done... Without qualified help I would have to resign this appointment. Otherwise, I am leading my men to slaughter. Hoover is backed against the wall. He does not like it.
M	HOOVER	Mr. Tolson will call you, Agent Purvis.
M	PURVIS	Thank you... Hoover hung up on him.
M	WINSTEAD	What'd he say he looked like?
M	HURT	Didn't say. Their suitcases have been set on the platform. A PORTER
M	PORTER	Gentlemen need a hand? Winstead gestures at their bags and one case. The PORTER goes
M	PORTER (CONTÂ°D)	Hardware salesmen?
M	WINSTEAD	That's right. His terse reply makes the garrulous porter stop talking.
M	CAMPBELL	I'll call.
M	HURT	I'm going to the men's room. Winstead spots a shoe-shine stand. Winstead sits, nods and
M	WINSTEAD	Wcrk around it. From under the brim of his hat, Winstead glances at big city

M	FRANK NITTI	by the railing, watches the race with Phil D'An.drea. As they
M	NITTI	I want Johnny Patton out front on the other four tracks. Tell Adonis. He can have the parking concessions, and maintenance. Annenberg wants to sell you the remaining equity in General News.
M	NITTI	How's he doing on the wire service?
M	PHIL D'ANDREA	Feeding to 300 bookies now. And he came up with this gimmick called a scratch sheet. Another beat. Nitti stops for a beat
M	NITTI	Its hot out, right?
M	PHIL D'ANDREA	Yeah, Frank.
M	NITTI	Ever since those pricks shot me I can't get warm. What?
M	PHIL D' ANDREA	Some friends from Chicago in the stands... D'Andrea nods. John Dillinger nods back. Nitti glances at Dillinger has on sunglasses. Billie is wearing a straw hat. A dog wins; not theirs. It calms down...
M	DILLINGER	Well drive out separately.
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	Billie and I want to hit the Gulf Coast on the way to Arizona.
M	PIERPONT	I want to take 66 and check banks in Denver and Phoenix. We'll meet you in Tucson on the 25th.
M	VAN METER	I think we wore out the Midwest for awhile. I heard one today. Indiana paper. "Wanted. John Dillinger. Dead or...dead." Billie doesn't laugh. Dillinger pulls her close and she can't D'Andrea's approached...
M	PHIL D'ANDREA	How d'ya like the track? C'mon to the Gc: -lonial for steaks tonight. You be our guests...
M	DILLINGER	Well be there.
M	PHIL D'ANDREA	Whatever these boys want, its on the house. He leaves. Pierpont, Makley and Homer go off to place new
M	DILLINGER	What? She is quiet for a moment.
F	BILLIE	Thank you, thank you for these last few weeks. I never thought I'd see Florida.
M	DILLINGER	You going somewhere, doll, am I?
F	BILLIE	It's been, three, four weeks. You'll look for a change. Or you'll get tired of me. And then I'll be sad and angry. So I wanted to say thank you before then... Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She
M	DILLINGER	You want to leave?
F	BILLIE	No. But I'm no fool. I'll be back checking coats at the Steuben Club.
M	DILLINGER	Well, I don't want you to leave. So it won't be that way.
F	BILLIE	Then it will be another way that's worse. You rob banks and you run rings around them, but you're likely to get killed or, get shot and...
M	DILLINGER	Who the hell gave you a crystal ball?!
M	WILLIE	Well, goddamn it, you don't need a crystal ball...! Ask Homer.
M	DILLINGER	Homer what...?
F	BILLIE	Homer and his damn joke... I don't want to be around to see any of that. Okay?! That's what it's about... Dillinger gets it.
M	DILLINGER	I am not going anywhere! I am going to die in your arms as an old man when that time comes. So what do you say about that?
M	CLOSE ON BILLIE	Now is the first time she allows herself to have any prospect She hikes up her skirt and sits on his lap and smothers him A fresh and tanned Dillinger and Billie are in a strikingly
M	CLERK	Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan of Green Bay, Wd cons in. How was your journey, sir?
M	DILLINGER	., â¢ ng.
M	CLERK	I can send up some sandwiches and beer, if you'd like.
M	DILLINGER	That would be swell. Some friends of mine should be here already. J.C. Davies and Mr. Long?
M	CLERK	Out shopping, I believe. I'll let them know you're in when they come back. Old BELLHOP takes Billie's bag to the elevator. Dillinger
M	DILLINGER	You want company? After.
M	DILLINGER	First time you ever put me off. You getting tired of me?
F	BILLIE	Get in here. She stretches out and wets her hair. She sits up to reach for
M	DILLINGER	Get dressed. Right now. He turns and runs into... THREE MEN burst in. One is the Clerk. He cracks Dillinger
M	CLERK/EYMAN	Put clothes on, miss.
M	PIERPONT + MAKLEY	escorted by six guards are being moved out of the jail.
M	DILLINGER	What happened?
M	PIERPONT	Fire in the hotel. Firemen found our guns. Laid for us! Sorry, John.
M	DILLINGER	Where they taking you?
M	PIERPONT	We're getting Shanghaied to Ohio!
M	DILLINGER	Where's Billie...? Thenthey're gone. They now move Dillinger through.
M	COP EYMAN	Your girl's been put on a bus back to Chicago. We ain't holding her.
M	MELVIN PURVIS	is there. Cowley and Baum are with him. Purvis is brought to But Dillinger reacts to Purvis. Well, the man who killed Pretty Boy Floyd. He might have been "Pretty," 'cause he sure was not "Whiz Kid Floyd." Deputies stifle laughter. Dillinger comes up close to Purvis.
M	DILLINGER (CONT'B)	Now these Arizona boys, here? They pulled on us right out. Didn't ask Washington for permission. Didn't make mistakes. Arizona Deputies enjoy the flattery. Dillinger studies
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	Sorry about that fellow Barton.. .one who got killed at the Sherone Apartments. Is he getting to Purvis?
M	DILLINGER (CONT ' D)	Newspaper said you found him alive. It's the eyes, ain't it? They look at you right before they go. Then they drift into nothing. Keep you up nights.
M	PURVIS	What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger? Now Dillinger reads him like an X-ray.
M	DILLINGER	You act like a confident man, Purvis. Bu _, I don't see it. You know a few things. You're probably okay when there's a groupÂ° of you got the other guy outnumbered. But death and mayhem up close? I am used to that and you are not, are you? When it's toe to toe, "One of us will die right here, right now," I don't think you got the get up and go. Purvis has nothing to say. He stares at Dillinger. Then he
M	PURVIS	Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.
M	DILLINGER	I'll see you down the road. From ten feet away. No you wont. The only way you'll leave a jail cell is when we take you out to execute you.
M	DILLINGER	Oh, yeah? We will see about that. Go get yourself another line of work, Melvin. Purvis gestures for the guards to let him out --
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	I was joking about the "we'll see about that." I'll let you boys keep me in this jail awhile.
M	COP EYMAN	We'd like that, Johnny, but don't get too comfortable. They're moving you.
M	DILLINGER	`Where to?
M	COP EYMAN	'Indiana.
M	DILLINGER	why? I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana. descends. Its 6:10pm on a snowy Tuesday evening, January at her desk when.
M	DEPUTY	He's here. A diminutive woman, SHERIFF HOLLEY goes to greet the massive
M	SHERIFF HOLLEY	Back up over there. Dellinger looks at the crowd. Per the "Chicago Daily News You can take the manacles off of him now.
M	REPORTER	Johnny, are you glad to see Indiana again? Dillinger's slow charismatic smile...
M	DILLINGER	About as glad as Indiana is to see me. Everybody laughs.
M	REPORTER #2	Did you smuggle the guns into Indiana State Penitentiary for the big break of September 26th?
M	REPORTER	How'd you get them in? Right there, you're too inquistive...
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Hey Bob... Put your arm around Dellinger. FLASHBULBS POP. They fluster Estill. Dillinger props his
M	REPORTER	When was the last time you were in Mooresville?
M	DILLINGER	Ten years ago. I was a boy and foolish. I held up a grocery store which I never shoulda done cause Mr. Morgan was a good man. And they sentenced me to 10 years in the state penitentiary for a 50 dollar theft. In prison, I met a lot of good -t las. I helped fix up the break at "f chigan City. Why not? I stick to my friends and they stick to me.
M	DILLINGER'S EYES	SEE him work the reporters. He knows that they are
M	ANOTHER REPORTER	How long does it take you to go through a bank?
M	DILLINGER	One minute and 40 seconds flat. Dillinger nods and turns away. He - not the Sheriff - ends
M	HOOVER (O.S.)	Why is this clown Estill fraternizing with the man he is scheduled to prosecute?! REVEAL we are in Hoover's office. LOUIS PIQUETT - a former bartender and Chicago gangland's
M	DILLINGER	You come highly recommended by Alvin Karpis. What can you do for me?
M	PIQUETT	What's on your mind?
M	DILLINGER	The electric chair. There's none of Dil linger's cocky joie de vivre. Thaw-'s for
M	PIQUETT	Your honor! Are we to have a hearing in accord with the laws of this nation, or is the State to be permitted to incite an atmosphere of prejudice? The very air reeks with the bloody rancor of intolerant malice. The clanging of shackles brings to our minds the dungeons of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked liberty of an American courtroom. I request the court to direct that those shackles be removed forthwith!
M	ROBERT ESTILL	This is a very dangerous man, your Honor.
M	DEPUTY HOLLEY	And I'm responsible for the safeguarding of the prisoner.
M	P IQUETT	Who are you?! Are you a lawyer? What right have you to address this court?
M	JUDGE MURRAY	Alright, remove the handcuffs from the prisoner.
M	ROBERT ESTILL	Your honor, we'd like to relocate the prisoner. Only Indiana State Prison in Michigan city can guarantee Dillinger will not escape.
M	JUDGE MURRAY	Sheriff Holley?
M	SHERIFF HOLLEY	I concur, your honor.
M	PIQUETT	Sheriff Holley, I think it's a very nice jail you have right here. What makes you think there's anything wrong with it?
M	SHERIFF HOLLEY	There isn't anything wrong with my jail! It's the strongest jail in Indiana.
M	PIQUETT	That's what I thought. But of course, I don't want to embarrass Mrs. Holley. I appreciate that she's a woman and if she's afraid of an escape...
M	SHERIFF HOLLEY	I'm not afraid of an escape. I can take care of John Dillinger or any other prisoner.
M	JUDGE MURRAY	Okay, Dillinger will stay here. Dillinger's staying in crown Point. Dillinger's relieved.
M	PIQUETT	Thank you, your Honor. The Defense will need four months to prepare itself.
M	ROBERT ESTILL	It should take 10 days.
M	PIQUETT	To go on trial in 10 days would be a legal lynching of this lad! There's a law against lynching!
M	ROBERT ESTILL	There's a law against murder!
M	PIQUETT	Then observe the law part. Or just stand Dillinger against the wall and shoot him. Then, there's no need to throw away the State's money on this mockery.
M	JUDGE MURRAY	Calm down.
M	PIQUETT	I apologize to the court. Bob and I respect each other very much.
M	JUDGE MURRAY	Watch out or he'll be putting his arm around you, too. Laughter ripples.
M	JUDGE MURRAY (CONT'D)	The trial starts in one month on March 12th. DILLINGER as he stands, handcuffs are reapplied. He leans to
M	DILLINGER	Atta boy, counsel.
M	CORRIDOR	It runs the length of the jail. At the far end is the barred
M	CAHOON	Bryant! GUARD BRYANT pulls a lever, opening the cells in the cell Dillinger and 14 PRISONERS step out of their cells, free to Dillinger jabs something in Cahoon's belly. Cahoon gets a
M	DILLINGER	-Cpme on, Sam, we're going places. A hulking black prisoner, HERBERT YOUNGBLOOD, holding a
M	DILLINGER (CONT'D)	Boys, get in there. Dillinger, Youngblood and Cahoon set off down the corridor.
M	DILLINGER	Call the warden.
M	CAHOON	Warden! Warden? Come on back! Warden LEW BAKER emerges from the office. Dillinger raises
M	WARDEN BAKER	That ain't real.
M	DILLINGER	Anything you say. Dellinger grabs him by the shirt, spins him round and jams it
M	DILLINGER	No one move or I'll plug the warden. Dillinger grabs two Tommy guns. Youngblood starts tying up
M	WARDEN BAKER	I was right, wasn't I? It's not real.
M	DILLINGER	Alright, which of these here cars is the fastest, and you're going with, so don't... lie.
M	SAAGER	That would be the Ford in the corner. It's got the new V-8.
M	DILLINGER	We're taking that. That's Sheriff Lillian Holley's personal car. That even more highly recommends it. Dillinger starts ripping
M	YOUNGBLOOD	We got a car following. Youngblood shoves the Thompson out the window and fires some
M	DILLINGER	Wow. Mr. Youngblood, are we clear now?
M	YOUNGBLOOD	We are.
M	DILLINGER	okay, folks. Dillinger checks his rearview mirror, then the speedometer. I'm going to write to Henry Ford. "Dear Henry Ford, Your 1934 Ford is the best damned getaway car in America. Yours -truly, John Dillinger." Relax folks... Dillinger ajoys the speed. He starts to hum. Then...
M	DILLINGER (CONYÂ°D)	Okay. Who knows The Last Round-up?" "Get along little doggie, get along.."
M	REPORTER	How did he act?
M	DEPUTY SHERIFF SLUNK	Well...he sang part of the way.
M	REPORTER	What did he sing?
M	DEPUTY SHERIFF SLUNK	You know The Last Round-up." "Get along little doggie, get along...
M	NARRATOR	As John Dillinger escaped from the Crown Point jail ...or as folks now call it, the "Clown Point Jail"...he appears immune to the forces of law. And commenting in his fireside address on March 5th, 1933...
M	FDR	The Federal government, you know, cannot be held up to mockery in this way... Hoover is rocked. It's as if FDR is saying Hoover is the man
M	NARRATOR	Meanwhile, the Emperor Haile Selassie.
M	DILLINGER	watches cars, people, then.
M	DILLINGER	It's me, Baby.
M	DILLINGER (PHONE)	I can't talk long. Are you okay?
F	BILLIE	Don't come to Chicago.
M	DILLINGER (O.S.)	I promised I'd look after you, didn't I?
F	BILLIE	Yes.
M	DILLINGER	And you believe me, don't you? You know I will look after you.
F	BILLIE	Yes.
M	DILLINGER	Say it. Say you know it.
F	BILLIE	Don't come to Chicago, Johnnie.
M	DILLINGER	Say it.
F	BILLIE	know you will look after me.
M	DILLINGER	love you, Baby. Dillinger ends the call. Hamilton waits in a Hudson at the With Baum.
M	PURVIS	She knows we're watching and he knows we're listening.
M	DILLINGER	Hiya Sport.
M	SPORT	How're ya doin' Mr. Johnny? You gotta hold it right there... Where's the warm welcome...?
M	DILLINGER	Where's Carole?
M	SPORT	They got moved to Newport, Kentucky. Can't stay here no more, Mr. Johnny.
M	DILLINGER	Says who?
M	ZARKOVICH	Sport's only following orders. So am I. He demonstrates that his palms are empty. He's smart enough
M	ZARKOVICH (CONT'D)	They thought you might come here. Zarkovich is nervous. Dillinger reaches for his front pocket.
M	ZARKOVICH (CONT ` D )	Your money is no good.
M	DILLINGER	I don't get it.
M	ZARKOVICH	You go talk to your pal, Gilbert.
M	DILLINGER	About what?
M	ZARKOVICH	Talk to Gilbert Catena. Dillinger, not taking his eyes off windows and doors, backs
M	RED HAMILTON'S	front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow on the bel,:, ,A worn-looking woman answers. She is HARRIET
M	DILLINGER	We're looking for Oscar...is he home?
M	MRS. LIEBOLDT	I'm Mrs. Lieboldt. And he ain't home. He's dead. Johnny glances at Red.
M	DILLINGER	I sure am sorry, ma'am. Was it an. accident?
M	MRS. LIEBOLDT	He accidentally got in the way of a shotgun when it was going off. What do you want?
M	DILLINGER	Oscar had "tools" of mine, he was repairing them.
M	MRS. LIEBOLDT	Everything that was here? Those people took it all away. It ain't here no more.
M	DILLINGER	I went to East Chicago to lay low. The welcome mat was not out. And I kept hearing your name. Then at Oscar's, my gear is gone. The deadly look in Dillinger's eyes leaves no mistake.
M	DILLINGER (CONTÂ°D)	I am going to ask you once. And I just did.
M	GILBERT	Let me make a telephone call. Dillinger nods.
M	GILBERT (CONT'D)	Gimme Phil... He's downstairs. He hangs up. He gestures to a doorway and stairs leading to come forward to frisk Johnny + Red. They gesture for them to
M	D'ANDREA	Anybody see him come in?
M	GILBERT	I don't think so. SOLDIER ONE. Dillinger turns the man, slams a knee into his
M	DILLINGER	Wanna know if we're armed? Were armed. He dumps this guy on his ass, his heavy shoe an ounce from
M	D'ANDREA	k around, Johnny. What do you see?
M	1 1 DILLINGER	A`lot of telephones.
M	D'ANDREA	You see money. Before last month there were independent wire services letting bookies know who won the third race at Sportman's Park. 300 of 'em. Now there's only one. Ours. General News. Nationwide. On October20, you robbed the bank in Green Castle, Indiana. You got away with $74,802. Split 5 ways, that's $14,960.40. You probably thought that was a big score. Dillinger stares at him. Where's this going?
M	D'ANDREA (CONT'D)	This room makes that much every day. That is how money gets made. And it keeps getting made, day after day after day. It is a river of money. Flowing right to us. And it gets deeper and it gets wider. Unless the cops come through that door.
M	DILLINGER	But they won't.
M	D'ANDREA	That's right. We pay them not to. Unless they know you're here. Then they come through the door, no matter what. What does that tell you?
M	DILLINGER	I'm popular.
M	D'ANDREA	You're bad for business. What this is, is called obsolescence.
M	D'ANDREA (CONT'D)	So the Syndicate got a new policy, Johnny. Guys like you? We ain't laundering your money or bonds no more. You ain't holing up in our whorehouses anymore. No armorers. No doctors. No nothing. That's the way it is. D'Andrea comes closer to him.
M	D'ANDREA (CONT'D)	And I am a messenger. This is business. Between us... He reaches into a pocket for cash. You need something to tide you by in case you're short? Dillinger and Red's looks say it all. They start out. Okay-but can you do me a personal favor? Dillinger hesitates.
M	D'ANDREA (CONT'D)	For my son, Mark. You're his hero. D'Andrea pulls out piece of paper and a pen. Dillinger looks
M	D'ANDREA. (CONT'D)	Good luck to you. You too, Red.
F	HAMILTON	Why'd you sign that asshole's paper?
M	DILLINGER	I don't know.
M	HOOVER	...they call Crown Point, "Clown Point." ,,.,The Bureau of Investigation cannot catch ""Public Enemy No. 1, but Arizona cowboys zï¿½.

That means I am allowing Dillinger to make a mockery of the system of justice in this country. It is a dark cloud. There is a silver lining in that cloud. By escaping, John Dillinger has given us a second chance to get John Dillinger. Hamilton has a 17 year old sister in Detroit. Arrest her. Dump her in the tank. Pick up all known Dillinger associates. Doctors. Question family members. Pierpont's mother in Indianapolis. Dillinger's family in Mooresville. Foreigners. We suspect all of them of harboring...
M	PURVIS	Hamilton's family hasn't had word from him in years ...
M	HOOVER	That's the point. Motivate them to get "word." Create informants, Agent Purvis.
M	HOOVER (CONT'D)	I want suspects interrogated "vigorously." "Grilled." No misplaced sentimentality. As they say in Italy and elsewhere these days..."take off the white gloves." By this point, they're down the Justice Department staircase.
