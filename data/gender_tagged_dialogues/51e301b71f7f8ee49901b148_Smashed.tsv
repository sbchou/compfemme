M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Let's give a hand to Rodney!
M	KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Next up, we've got a little lady named...KATE!
M	BAR VOICES (V.O.)	Yeah, Kate!
M	LATER	
M	CHARLIE	That was so good, baby!
F	KATE	Bullshit.
M	CHARLIE	I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel.
F	KATE	If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say?
M	CHARLIE	I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive.
F	KATE	That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen.
M	OWEN	Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell.
F	KATE	She's hot! What can't you tell?
M	OWEN	She looks like she could kick my ass. No way would she go for a guy like me.
F	KATE	You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.
M	OWEN	I don't know...forget about it.
F	KATE	I'll take point -- follow me.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week.
M	FEMALE BARTENDER	`Kay.
M	FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT'D)	That's fifteen.
F	KATE	Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him?
M	FEMALE BARTENDER	What happened?
F	KATE	He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer! * And she dumped him.
M	FEMALE BARTENDER	You kickbox?
M	OWEN	Yeah.
F	KATE	And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!
M	OWEN	A lot of `em don't have parents -- so...it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing. I know it sounds silly, but I feel responsible for them -- like... ...I could be their parent.
F	KATE	I think I got him laid.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah?
F	KATE	She seems totally game.
M	CHARLIE	Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?
F	KATE	I think I'm done for the night.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah?
M	OWEN	She's seen "Say Anything."
M	CHARLIE	Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh? Wanna drive us home? You guys stay here.
M	CHARLIE	I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and... ...you know.
F	KATE	I'll be home when you get there. We can "you know" then.
M	OWEN	Yeah, man -- you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything.
M	CHARLIE	Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work harder. Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive.
F	KATE	So's Owen. I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up.
M	CHARLIE	Tell that to the cops. Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.
F	KATE	I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women.
M	CHARLIE	That sounds like two missions.
F	KATE	No, it's just one.
M	CHARLIE	It kinda sounded like two, right?
M	OWEN	It did.
F	KATE	GoodbyeIloveyouboth!
F	KATE	You okay?
F	FREDA	Yeah. Are you?
F	KATE	Um...sure.
F	FREDA	Good. Hey, I'm not really okay.
F	KATE	Oh...
F	FREDA	My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
F	KATE	I guess I could...
F	FREDA	You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you!
F	KATE	I was gonna say "call you a cab," `cause, you know -- I don't even know you.
F	FREDA	It's not far. Please? Pretty please...?
F	FREDA	You know, you shouldn't drink and drive.
F	KATE	I wasn't --
F	FREDA	Just kidding. Can I have a sip? speechless.
M	FREDA (CONT'D)	I'm really thirsty.
F	KATE	It's, uh...whiskey.
F	FREDA	Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me!
F	KATE	I don't know. No.
F	FREDA	Can I smoke in your car?
F	KATE	Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?
F	FREDA	Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
F	KATE	WHOA!
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Not what I thought you meant.
F	FREDA	Want a hit?
F	KATE	No, I...is that pot?
F	FREDA	Of course not! What do I look like? A stoner?
M	FREDA (CONT'D)	It's crack.
F	KATE	Oh, shit! No...no thank you.
F	FREDA	C'mon -- it's good crack.
F	KATE	I don't, um...I've never smoked crack.
F	FREDA	Really? This stuff is the truth -- and it'll sober you up.
F	KATE	Uh...I think you should go.
F	FREDA	I'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at * night?
F	KATE	I don't know -- people might offer you crack?
F	FREDA	Seriously? It's not a big deal -- just take a little hit.
F	KATE	I said no.
F	FREDA	One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober you up.
M	FREDA (CONT'D)	Smoke me!
F	KATE	One puff. Then we are both going home.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Fine.
F	FREDA	You've got money, right?
F	KATE	...'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything." But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. Eating used to be my thing. When I started drinking, though, I kinda stopped eating so much. But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different.
M	CHARLIE	Huh?!
F	KATE	Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep.
M	CHARLIE	What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited.
F	KATE	It's a long story.
M	CHARLIE	I was worried. I kept calling you.
F	KATE	I ended up...
M	CHARLIE	You smell funny. What do you smell like?
F	KATE	I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive.
M	CHARLIE	So, why didn't you come back or call me?
F	KATE	Charlie -- -- I'm fine.
M	CHARLIE	Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes. I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work.
M	CHARLIE	I can't be worried about you all the time.
F	KATE	Don't worry so much. I'm fine. C'mon -- let me get you to bed.
M	CHARLIE	I'm up now -- how `bout I make us bacon and egg sandwiches?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Magic words.
M	CHARLIE	Check for your mom's on the table.
F	KATE	Thanks, baby.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Why does the coffee taste so much better when you make it?
M	CHARLIE	Because I make it with love -- and bacon.
F	KATE	Now, if I add a "C," what word do I have?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Yes, Hillary? *
M	HILLARY *	Can?
F	KATE	That's correct! Can. You've won an all-expenses paid trip to the blackboard, Hillary! *
M	KATE (CONT'D)	C'mon...there's a washer-dryer combo in it for you.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Great job, Hillary -- let's give * her a round of applause!
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Can anyone use "can" in a sentence?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Yes?
F	ANGELA	"Hurry up in there -- I gotta use the can!"
F	KATE	Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Now -- -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to "an"? C'mon...
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Yes -- Ramon?
M	RAMON	P.
F	KATE	P...okay, what word would that make if I added a "P"?
M	RAMON	Um...pan?
F	KATE	Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN!
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Wow! Just look at that excellent penman --
M	KIDS	EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON!
F	KATE	I'm so sorry you had to see that.
M	HILLARY *	Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?
F	KATE	What?
M	HILLARY *	My mommy threw up when she was pregnant with my little sister. Are you pregnant?
M	RAMON	Are you?
F	KATE	Yes.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Vice Principal Davies will be looking after your students for the rest of the day -- so you don't need to worry about that.
F	KATE	Oh, that's really good to know. I'll have to thank him. I just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm sure they've seen plenty worse. So -- how long have you been pregnant?
F	KATE	Um...it's the first trimester.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Well, it's very exciting. You must be thrilled.
F	KATE	Uh-huh.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Can I ask a...personal question?
F	KATE	Okay.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	How's it... ...going for you?
F	KATE	Huh?
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	The pregnancy, I mean.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)	Having kids wasn't in the cards for me. I came close, but... ...I mean, it's like I've got a couple hundred kids here -- -- but...I don't fool myself. It's not the same.
F	KATE	Well...it's hard to explain.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Of course...
F	KATE	I wouldn't call it a burden, but --
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	It's a responsibility.
F	KATE	Yeah. Exactly.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	You're so lucky. Can I...touch it?
F	KATE	Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps a lot.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Of course.
F	KATE	Like...a lot.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Hello in there. Can you hear me? You're a tiny miracle. Did you know that? A miracle. embarrassed themselves).
F	KATE	Thank you.
M	MR. DAVIES	Is everything, um...okay, Mrs. Hannah?
F	KATE	Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you.
M	MR. DAVIES	Look -- I'm not a fool. I know you were drinking this morning.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	I saw you.
F	KATE	Oh, no, I...
M	MR. DAVIES	Drinking when you're pregnant is really dangerous.
F	KATE	I know that! Oh, God, I... ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant.
M	MR. DAVIES	What?
F	KATE	I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked.
M	MR. DAVIES	Oh. That's...not good.
F	KATE	I know. I...please don't say anything.
M	MR. DAVIES	Just...go home. Get some sleep.
F	KATE	I had such a crappy morning.
M	CHARLIE	Me too. I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff.
F	KATE	I told my class I was pregnant.
M	CHARLIE	Oh, baby, that's --
F	KATE	I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.
M	CHARLIE	Oh. `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true. `Course then I'd have to drink your beer...
F	KATE	Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them.
M	CHARLIE	Ooh...
F	KATE	Yeah, that's what they said. Listen...I can't do this anymore.
M	CHARLIE	What do you mean?
F	KATE	I dunno. I think I might...drink too much.
M	CHARLIE	Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.
M	swigs his beer.	
F	KATE	know I do -- I'm a fucking
M	CHARLIE	-- that's not true. You're And brilliant. And I you. I wouldn't be married to "mess."
F	KATE	left work after puking in front * little kids. And...now I'm * in the middle of the day. *
M	CHARLIE	those things happen mean, they shouldn't happen all time, but...it's the price of, truly living life.
F	KATE	that like a slogan for some of beer or toothpaste or
M	CHARLIE	And it's true -- you and me, not just some boring couple the suburbs who don't sleep with other and have nothing to talk except whatever TV show currently into. like...still know how to party.
F	KATE	think I need to slow down. I might need help.
M	CHARLIE	help you.
F	KATE	know, but...I might need more
M	CHARLIE	Like a therapist?
F	KATE	I don't know -- I just get stupid when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a lot.
M	CHARLIE	We just like to have a good time.
F	KATE	Yeah, well... ...you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone.
M	CHARLIE	I promise.
F	KATE	That includes Owen.
M	CHARLIE	Of course.
F	KATE	Well, last night I kinda, um... ...smoked some crack.
M	CHARLIE	WHAT?!
F	KATE	After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her.
M	CHARLIE	Uh...how's that even happen? You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?!
F	KATE	Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home.
M	CHARLIE	Where?
F	KATE	Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent?
M	CHARLIE	What?
F	KATE	Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl. To be honest, I'm not sure...
M	CHARLIE	Oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? Did you...share a pipe?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Ughhh... Just playing Devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack-smoking you need help with and not the drinking.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I'm just saying.
F	KATE	The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do. I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex?
M	CHARLIE	We'll chill out with the booze for a while. We can just be wine-with- * dinner people. How's that sound?
M	CHARLIE	Maybe you should go to, uh... one of those meetings. They have `em over there.
F	KATE	Yeah, right.
M	CHARLIE	Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there?
F	KATE	Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to like every question and at the end it was like, "If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!"
M	CHARLIE	Yeah... ...that was fun, wasn't it? Hey --
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	-- look out for that crack!
F	KATE	What crack?
M	CHARLIE	Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there... ...but you must have smoked it last night.
M	CHARLIE	"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?"
F	KATE	Absolutely.
M	CHARLIE	"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?"
F	KATE	Envy isn't exactly the right word...
M	CHARLIE	"Do you have `blackouts'?"
F	KATE	Yeah, but who doesn't?
M	CHARLIE	"Has your drinking caused trouble at home?"
F	KATE	No! We're great.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of "yes" answers. Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
F	KATE	I'm gonna go!
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, right.
F	KATE	No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it?
M	CHARLIE	Eight.
F	KATE	See ya.
M	CHARLIE	Uh-huh...
F	KATE	This is me: going.
M	CHARLIE	You've been boozing.
F	KATE	So? You should come too!
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something.
F	KATE	Oh, yeah? Watch me!
M	DONOVAN	Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.
F	KATE	Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!
M	DONOVAN	You must be a newcomer, huh?
F	KATE	A what?
M	DONOVAN	Um, I'm not really allowed to talk to new chicks, but there are lots of women here who can help you out.
F	KATE	Okay. Do I just sit wherever?
M	DONOVAN	The meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere. the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
M	LILY *	Are you new?
F	KATE	To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering?
M	SHANA *	It's hard, huh?
F	KATE	I guess.
M	LILY *	Everything's going to be fine. You're home. Jim Jones' church.
M	TATTOO MAN	Not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better - - is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery?
F	KATE	I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?
M	TATTOO MAN	You know, Kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had * a drink or any mind-altering substance in the past 24 hours.
F	KATE	I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --
M	TATTOO MAN	Welcome, Kate. It gets better.
F	KATE	I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...
M	TATTOO MAN	Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though.
M	LILY *	Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story.
F	AMBER	Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy...
F	KATE	How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? How old are you, Amber?
M	SHANA *	Be respectful.
F	AMBER	Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday!
F	KATE	Everyday?
F	AMBER	It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course!
M	EVERYONE	God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference.
F	KATE	AMEN!
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Okay...I think I'm good.
F	KATE	So much for that.
M	CHARLIE	Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
F	KATE	No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!
M	CHARLIE	Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though -- -- you're the one with the problem.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink.
F	KATE	I don't have to drink. I just really like to drink. *
M	CHARLIE	Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world. Oh, no you didn't!
M	CHARLIE	Are you trying to have some sex?
M	CLERK	You know I can't sell you this, Kate.
F	KATE	What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me.
M	CLERK	Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're old enough -- but it's too late.
F	KATE	C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two...
M	CLERK	Stop it.
F	KATE	It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything.
M	CLERK	I don't think so. Sorry.
F	KATE	Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want.
M	CLERK	It's the law. I can't sell alcohol after 2 a.m. You know that.
F	KATE	Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends.
M	CLERK	I could lose my job.
F	KATE	You distract him, okay?!
M	CLERK	Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead?
F	KATE	Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick?
M	CLERK	Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go.
M	CLERK (CONT'D)	Seriously, Kate. You should go.
F	KATE	Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
M	KATE (CONT'D)	This is bullshit! I have to pee.
M	CLERK	What the fuck are you doing?!
F	KATE	I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad. *
M	CLERK	Get outta here NOW!
F	KATE	C'mon...can't we drink together?
F	KATE	Charlie!
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Not again.
M	CHARLIE	Come back to bed, baby.
F	KATE	I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.
M	CHARLIE	Well, you peed on me so I guess * we're even. *
F	KATE	I have a weak bladder.
M	CHARLIE	Well...I can't go to work like this.
F	KATE	You work from our kitchen.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job. Hey -- where were you last night?
F	KATE	Huh?
M	CHARLIE	I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone.
F	KATE	Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming.
F	KATE	I...
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I can only imagine the chemistry experiment that's going on --
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)	-- in there.
M	RAMON	Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?
F	KATE	I don't know yet.
M	HILLARY *	When will you know?
F	KATE	Not until summertime. You guys will be on vacation.
M	RAMON	If you have a boy what will you name him?
F	KATE	Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?
F	ANGELA	That's a name for a man -- not a baby!
F	KATE	Thanks again for covering for me.
M	MR. DAVIES	I can't promise to cover for you every time you get pregnant.
F	KATE	There won't be another time.
M	MR. DAVIES	I genuinely hope not. Look -- I didn't tell Barnes, but if anything like this happens again I'll have to.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Okay...Kate?
F	KATE	Okay... ...David?
M	MR. DAVIES	Dave.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	I know -- Dave Davies...yup...hah- hah. Anyway, uh, is everything okay with you?
F	KATE	I don't know. Um...no?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh?
M	MR. DAVIES	No, I don't think so.
F	KATE	I went to AA last night.
M	MR. DAVIES	Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it?
F	KATE	It was awful. I kept getting shushed.
M	MR. DAVIES	I don't normally tell people I work with this... but -- -- I'm a bit of an expert when it comes to these things.
F	KATE	You?
M	MR. DAVIES	Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one. * I'm nine years sober, AA and NA. I used to drink cocaine. It's really cheap in the Philippines.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Listen, Kate. I know meetings can be weird. Especially at first, but if you want to...you never need to feel like you have to...but the ones I go to are pretty small. Nice little groups. I'd be happy to take you.
F	KATE	Maybe that would be good...I don't know.
M	MR. DAVIES	No pressure, okay. That shit saved my life, though.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms. Carol's art class. They're making macaroni art, so...I'm pretty stoked.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something for you... Folic Acid! You need it now like never before.
F	KATE	Thanks.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I bet your mother is over the moon, huh? Probably planning you a baby shower...?
F	KATE	Oh, well...she and I aren't that close.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- I'm * here, okay? Now drink up -- that baby in there's thirsty!
F	KATE	Okay. And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...?
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	My lips are --
F	KATE	Hey...
M	CHARLIE	Howdy.
F	KATE	How was your day? And what's that smell?
M	CHARLIE	Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.
F	KATE	Charlie! You need to eat.
M	CHARLIE	What? It's tasty. So...I'm going to see that band * from Iceland with the triplets play * tonight. Want to come with me and Owen to check it out?
F	KATE	Oh, that sounds fun, but...
M	CHARLIE	C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls without you.
F	KATE	I don't know...this guy I work with -- Mr. Davies --
M	CHARLIE	The Vice Principal?
F	KATE	Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting.
M	CHARLIE	Wow, that's...uh, cool.
F	KATE	What?
M	CHARLIE	Nothing -- I just...I didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday. In fact, it sounded like you hated it. So I'm kinda surprised you're going back.
F	KATE	Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot. Besides -- I was hammered last night. Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm just gonna, you know, try something * different...
M	CHARLIE	I'm here for you, okay? Even though I drink -- I could slow down if you need me to. I'm sure I could.
M	MR. DAVIES	This is a little more my speed. No one here is the slightest bit hip.
F	KATE	Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here?
M	MR. DAVIES	Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells their story. And then everyone else shares -- talks.
F	KATE	So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?
M	MR. DAVIES	No -- I don't think I could do * that. `Cause, um... ...well, it could get weird. But * I'll help you find one if you want. We should sit down.
F	KATE	I can't believe I'm really here.
M	MR. DAVIES	It gets better. Weirder, maybe -- but better.
M	JENNY *	...all I knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by. I had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time -- or pay my fucking bills at all. Now I pay my bills online.
M	JENNY (CONT'D) *	And I found a love in cooking. I've * got my own catering business now. * And...maybe I just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since I woke up in a park -- in a different state.
F	KATE	I kinda like her.
M	MR. DAVIES	Sponsor potential?
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Get her number at break.
F	KATE	I feel like you're my wingman.
M	ARLO *	Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em.
F	KATE	Hey, I liked your speech.
M	JENNY *	Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least entertaining. What's your name?
F	KATE	Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted.
M	JENNY *	Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some of that.
F	KATE	I don't really know how this stuff works. But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but...
M	JENNY *	Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk.
F	KATE	Okay. Yeah. You've been sober since you were
M	KATE (CONT'D)	That seems really young.
M	JENNY *	I didn't have much of a choice -- I crashed my car into a nursing home. I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on.
M	TINA *	...anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening.
F	KATE	Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and... ...I'm an alcoholic?
M	GROUP	Hi, Kate.
F	KATE	Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words... ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed. It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. I'm kinda...scared. A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:
M	FADE IN:	
M	MR. DAVIES (V.O.)	How about ninety days?
M	MR. DAVIES	Is there anyone here who has ninety days of continuous sobriety?
F	KATE	I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.
M	EVERYONE	Hi, Kate.
M	JENNY *	Congratulations.
M	JENNY *	I'm really proud of you, Kate.
F	KATE	I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days. The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week.
M	MR. DAVIES	My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again. It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem.
M	JENNY *	Like what? *
F	KATE	Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom...
M	JENNY *	When was the last time you saw her?
F	KATE	A year, at least.
M	JENNY *	Well...maybe it's time.
F	KATE	Maybe. And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. We haven't slept together in forever... I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good.
M	JENNY *	It takes time. Keep working the steps. Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I should actually run you home now and come back. I need to start locking up.
F	KATE	I could stick around and help you...
M	MR. DAVIES	I could take you home. If you want.
M	MR. DAVIES	My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- well, not like us, but as soon as I got sober I started to change and she just...didn't.
F	KATE	I didn't know you were married.
M	MR. DAVIES	Yeah, I was married once -- -- in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff.
F	KATE	Why?
M	MR. DAVIES	I don't know...
F	KATE	Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that "men stick with men, women stick with women" stuff.
M	MR. DAVIES	Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand.
F	KATE	Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?
M	MR. DAVIES	What am I, one of your students? * Crush?
F	KATE	Yeah, crush.
M	MR. DAVIES	I kind of do, yes. I have a crush on you. I know that's wrong -- you're newly sober and married and I shouldn't be thinking about you like that. But yeah, I should put that out on the table. Honesty.
F	KATE	It's okay. I think you're a really good guy.
M	MR. DAVIES	Oh, great -- good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' books.
F	KATE	Oh, c'mon...
M	MR. DAVIES	I think you're beautiful.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	And smart, and sexy, and cool...
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	And I know it's wrong, but -- in meetings I stare at your lips and your legs and all I can think about is fucking your moist pussy.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Oh, crap! I don't know why I just said that. I'm really, really sorry.
F	KATE	WHAT THE FUCK?
M	MR. DAVIES	Oh, that was a bad thing to say, right?
F	KATE	YES.
M	MR. DAVIES	I'm so, so sorry. I'm just confused, and I don't know how to talk to women --
F	KATE	Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their "moist pussy." Who even says that?
M	MR. DAVIES	I'm really sorry.
F	KATE	I have to go inside my house -- where I live with my husband. Thanks for your creepy version of honesty.
F	KATE	You okay?
M	CHARLIE	Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The tortoise wins the race.
F	KATE	Actually, I'm not really in the mood. But I wanted to give you a 90 days gift.
F	KATE	It's okay -- the 90 days was the gift.
M	CHARLIE	Sorry if I was doing a bad job -- I'm kinda hammered.
F	KATE	It's alright. Charlie... ...I miss you.
M	CHARLIE	Huh? *
F	KATE	I mean...I don't know. I don't really feel connected to you anymore.
M	CHARLIE	Did I do something?
F	KATE	No. We don't talk that much.
M	CHARLIE	We used to talk, but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back I'm --
F	KATE	Kinda drunk.
M	CHARLIE	I was gonna say "tired."
F	KATE	There's some stuff I need to do this weekend. I think I'm gonna go up to Lake Arrowhead.
M	CHARLIE	Really? To see your mom?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Why?
F	KATE	Do I need a reason?
M	CHARLIE	With your mom? Kinda. Is this the "amends" step?
F	KATE	No.
M	CHARLIE	Well then why're you going?
F	KATE	We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her. And Jenny thinks it would be a good * idea.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	What?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know...I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do?
F	KATE	No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something?
M	CHARLIE	I dunno...it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom. And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her.
F	KATE	Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This just...it felt like the right time. With all the changes I'm going through.
M	CHARLIE	Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation.
F	KATE	Um...I think I should go alone.
M	CHARLIE	Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and stuff.
F	KATE	Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink. Just while we're there.
M	CHARLIE	I think I can handle not drinking for like a day.
M	CHARLIE	Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Hi, Holger!
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	So...we gonna go in?
F	KATE	I should've brought something.
M	CHARLIE	You're fine.
F	KATE	Something, you know? Flowers, or...
M	CHARLIE	Wine?
F	KATE	No. Definitely not that. Go on...
M	FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)	S'minute!
F	KATE	Oh, God...
F	ROCHELLE	Katie! What're you doing here?
F	KATE	I left you a message, mom.
F	ROCHELLE	Oh, you know I don't check that thing. Hello there, young man.
M	CHARLIE	Hi, Ms. Foster.
F	ROCHELLE	Well, then... ...what a lovely surprise -- you two came to visit. Hell has frozen over. Just kidding. Come inside -- let me fix you both some drinks.
F	KATE	Just water for me. ...you wouldn't believe how much the neighborhood's changed! After Mr. Baker passed away and the kids put Mrs. Baker in a home, the people that moved in, oof!
M	ROCHELLE (CONT'D)	It's like they don't even understand the concept of birth control in their country!
M	ROCHELLE (CONT'D)	If you ask me, I think it's a meth house. They've always got those little five year old twins "playing" in the yard, but I'm pretty sure they're the lookouts.
F	KATE	That's pretty wild, mom.
F	ROCHELLE	Right? What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot how to mix `em?
F	KATE	I told you I just wanted water.
F	ROCHELLE	Oh, please! Where I'm from, "no" means "yes." Am I right or am I right?
M	CHARLIE	Huh-huh...
F	KATE	That's actually why I wanted to come up, mom. I stopped drinking.
F	ROCHELLE	Are you telling me I'm going to be a grandma?
M	ROCHELLE (CONT'D)	Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna be a grandma! And you know that "no drinking when you're pregnant" thing is just a myth. I drank plenty when I was pregnant with Kate -- and look how she turned out!
F	KATE	I'm not pregnant, mom.
F	ROCHELLE	Oh.
F	KATE	I just needed a break. I'm sober for the first time in years.
F	ROCHELLE	Well... ...we'll see how long that lasts.
F	KATE	It's been a while, actually.
M	CHARLIE	90 days.
F	ROCHELLE	You've sure picked the right partner -- -- for this little mission.
M	CHARLIE	Hey -- I'm not drinking either...today.
F	KATE	Drink if you want to, Charlie. Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself. And...I started going to 12-step meetings.
F	ROCHELLE	Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous. Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. Dried up. Left me. You can see how well that worked out for me... ...I raised his daughter in this PALACE while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids. Bastard. You better be careful -- they change.
F	KATE	I thought you'd be happy for me, mom.
F	ROCHELLE	Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a good hostess, am I?
M	ROCHELLE (CONT'D)	I'll microwave you your favorite.
M	ROCHELLE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch.
F	KATE	It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it.
F	KATE	This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned. We came here every year the week before Christmas. And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	This is what I think of when I think of Christmas. Thanks for coming up here with me.
M	CHARLIE	Of course.
F	KATE	I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
M	CHARLIE	She just can't handle her liquor.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here?
F	KATE	Huh?
M	CHARLIE	You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something?
F	KATE	Um...no.
M	CHARLIE	I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you.
M	TEACHERS	SURPRISE!
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I just had to tell everyone so we could celebrate.
F	KATE	Oh...you shouldn't have.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	You don't have to thank me -- just open your presents!
F	KATE	Wow...
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Go ahead.
M	OTHER TEACHERS	`C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love what I got you! Is it a boy or a girl?
F	KATE	Oh, it's so...nice.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	It's to hang over the crib!
F	KATE	Uh-huh...
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Mmmm...it's so moist. Kate!
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Kate?
F	KATE	What?
M	MR. DAVIES	Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You have no idea how much this has been eating me up. beat.
F	KATE	What you said to me was really fucked up.
M	MR. DAVIES	I know.
F	KATE	What were you even thinking?
M	MR. DAVIES	I wasn't -- I was just...I try to be really honest.
F	KATE	I get that. But you can't force your "honesty" on everyone you know.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I'm flattered that you have...feelings for me. I am. But I'm married.
M	MR. DAVIES	I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize to your husband if you want.
F	KATE	No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever.
M	MR. DAVIES	Okay.
F	KATE	Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb. Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say "moist pussy" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body!
M	MR. DAVIES	Okay. Thank you. I feel like this was a really good talk.
M	GREG *	...getting married would fucking * suck. I can't even imagine waking * up to the same person for the rest * of my life. * What's up, Kate? Hey, Kate.
M	KATE *	I see you guys found the birthday * cake Jenny and I baked. *
M	OWEN *	Yeah, thanks! You should get a * slice. *
M	KATE *	I, uh...kinda thought we'd all eat * it together. *
M	CHARLIE *	Baby -- I didn't even think about * that. I'm sorry. *
M	OWEN *	It was really good. *
M	GREG *	We have plenty of tequila to make * up for the cake. * Kate's in AA -- so she can't drink. * She hasn't drank in forever -- like * thirty-eight days or some shit. *
M	KATE *	Ninety-five days, actually. *
M	GREG *	That sucks! Do you still smoke * weed? *
M	KATE *	No, I wasn't a big weed smoker * anyway. *
M	OWEN *	You smoked crack though, didn't * you? *
M	GREG *	Shit -- I hear crack gets you so * high! * No -- my wife doesn't smoke crack. * Jesus... * What? I'm joking around. I know * Kate's not a crackhead or some * shit. * It was just that one time, right? * Thanks, Charlie. *
M	CHARLIE *	It's your birthday, man, so I'm not * gonna make a big deal out of this -- * but you need to shut the fuck up * sometimes. *
M	CHARLIE	Listen -- I'm sorry. He's drunk...really drunk.
F	KATE	I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at you! You said you wouldn't tell anyone about what I did.
M	CHARLIE	I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when I told him.
F	KATE	Great. Why don't you guys just go to the bar now?
M	CHARLIE	You wanna come?
F	KATE	I'm hanging here.
M	CHARLIE	I'm sure they have near-beer, baby. It'll be fun.
F	KATE	I'm staying in.
M	CHARLIE	That sounds like a lot of fun.
F	KATE	Bye.
M	CHARLIE	I love you. I love you...?
F	KATE	Yeah... ...I love you too.
F	KATE	Yes?
M	ISABEL *	Mrs. Hannah -- shouldn't you be more fatter?
F	KATE	What?
M	ISABEL *	`Cause of the baby. My mom got real fat.
F	KATE	Well..."Shouldn't you be fatter?" is the correct way to ask that question. Now, one day when you're very old and wise fourth graders, you'll learn about multiplication and --
M	ISABEL *	Mrs. Hannah -- Shouldn't you be more fat?
F	KATE	Well, I... ...I'm not going to have a baby.
M	CLASS	OOOH!
F	KATE	See -- I was pregnant but, it wasn't my time, I suppose...
M	WINNIE *	Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the baby?
F	KATE	WHAT? No -- of course not!
M	WINNIE *	`Cause my mom says that when you kill a baby you go to hell and you can't even go to church to ask god for forgiveness.
M	TOBY	Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to hell?
F	KATE	No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But... ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant.
M	WINNIE *	Because a doctor murders it!
F	KATE	No -- not because a doctor murdered it. It's called a miscarriage. That means it wasn't my plan -- it's just what happened. Does anyone want to ask me any questions?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both.
M	MR. DAVIES	Well, that was bound to happen at some point. Kids notice things like that.
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	But I had no idea how pro-life little Winnie Reddy is. * Remind me to wear my "May the fetus you save be gay" T-shirt to the next banana split night. And just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on. I mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders.
F	KATE	Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant?
M	MR. DAVIES	You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously?
M	MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)	Well, the good thing is that it's all over now. Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby. The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it.
F	KATE	And the bad news?
M	MR. DAVIES	You lied. To your boss -- and a bunch of small children. Who trust you. And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong.
F	KATE	That's all, huh?
M	CHARLIE	Well... ...I gotta say -- this is the boringest meal I've had in about as long as I can remember. Who're you texting?
F	KATE	Jenny. *
M	CHARLIE	She's like a parole officer.
F	KATE	She's my sponsor.
M	CHARLIE	I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know.
F	KATE	So...what'd you do today, honey?
M	CHARLIE	I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear. You do anything special?
F	KATE	I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	That's not funny.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way.
F	KATE	Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby.
M	CHARLIE	God, Kate -- come on. What else were you supposed to do?
F	KATE	Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying.
M	CHARLIE	It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is this what those meetings teach you? To make drama out of nothing?
F	KATE	It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions.
M	CHARLIE	Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant? That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night? Would you feel better about yourself then?
F	KATE	I've been thinking about doing that, actually. Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself.
M	CHARLIE	Fine. Do it, then. I guess you don't need a job.
F	KATE	I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible.
M	CHARLIE	I never do anything responsible? What about buying this house that we live in? Or the food that we're eating?
F	KATE	Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite.
M	CHARLIE	Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around.
F	KATE	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
M	CHARLIE	Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. You should be grateful we don't have to struggle.
F	KATE	I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life. I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands.
M	CHARLIE	What the fuck are you talking about?
F	KATE	I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby.
M	CHARLIE	You know what?
F	KATE	What?
M	CHARLIE	I fucking hate AA! It turned you into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.
F	KATE	At least I'm not drunk all the time.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint? You have it all together and I'm just a baby?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to understand you. But it's hard. You're different and maybe it's good that you're different. Maybe I'm bad and bad for you or something -- because I didn't think the person you were before was so awful. I loved that person. Yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things...but she was my Kate.
F	KATE	You loved that person? Do you not love me now?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, of course. But it's different. You're different.
F	KATE	Before I was a mess. I'm finally getting my life together -- and you loved me more before?
M	CHARLIE	Kinda, yeah.
F	KATE	I feel so fucking weird right now -- Charlie doesn't love me like he used to and I've lied to my students multiple times.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I just don't feel...normal right now.
M	JENNY *	Well, you're not normal. None of us are.
F	KATE	Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic.
M	JENNY *	I'm not just talking about alcoholics. People are fucking weird. We all have a lot of shit we carry around in our heads that doesn't make sense. At least alcoholics have tools to work through it. *
F	KATE	"Steps"... Yeah, steps -- and talking and listening and crying...
F	KATE	I have the crying part covered.
M	JENNY *	I know, right? I think my first year I cried tears I'd been saving since I was eight. It's hard to live your life...honestly. You know?
M	JENNY (CONT'D) *	Any idea what you're gonna do about your school situation? What you're gonna say?
M	shakes her head.	I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything.
M	JENNY *	Listen...you wanna stay in my guest * room tonight? You can watch movies, get some good sleep...?
F	KATE	You sure that's okay?
M	JENNY *	Yeah, of course. That's why I spent money on a guest bed -- so people could sleep in it. I know it might feel like it, but really, you don't have to figure everything out tonight. You've got time.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I'm so sorry, Kate. I haven't told many people this, but when I was young -- younger than you...I lost a child too.
F	KATE	I'm...I'm really sorry.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to. Have a seat.
M	Kate sits down.	I got a phone call from a very upset parent. That's how I found out about...you know. Frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me.
F	KATE	I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again.
F	KATE	It won't. I promise that.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	By "not happening again," I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems "family matters" with your class. No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol.
F	KATE	Okay, I...
M	KATE (CONT'D)	...I can't keep doing this. I feel awful.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I know this all must be hard for you --
F	KATE	No. You don't understand. I have to be honest with you.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	What do you mean?
F	KATE	Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant. I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	But...you vomited in class.
F	KATE	I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is --
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer?
F	KATE	No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um... ...it's alcoholism.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	What?
F	KATE	I've been working on it. I'm one- hundred days sober. When that happened I'd been out drinking and was hung over and --
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	You vomited in front of children because you were hung over?
F	KATE	Yes.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	And lied, saying that you were pregnant?
F	KATE	Well, a student asked if I was pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of fell out of my mouth.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	That's sick, Kate.
F	KATE	I know.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	No, I don't think you understand how wrong that is. To lie to me -- to the children. You know I felt so terrible for you when I found out that you had a mis -- ? -- how can you play with people's emotions like that?
F	KATE	I was sick.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Jesus...you told us you had a miscarriage.
F	KATE	I'm sorry.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I threw you a baby shower.
F	KATE	I'm really sorry. I am. I've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me. I'm in AA now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything. It's really hard. I mean, I think my husband might hate me, and --
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I'm sorry, but what you did is totally irresponsible.
F	KATE	I know.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I can't have you here anymore.
F	KATE	Am I being fired?
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	No, no -- the state wouldn't allow that without a report. I'm not going to write a report. Because, frankly, I have no idea what that report would say. But I'm forcing you to take a leave of absence and I think it's in your best interest if you find a job elsewhere.
F	KATE	Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm doing the right things now.
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	I believe you -- or I want to. I really do. But honey -- I believed you before. I'll have a sub take over your class starting tomorrow. It's late enough in the year that we can just say you're having personal problems
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)	-- which seems to be the truth.
F	KATE	Principal Barnes --
M	PRINCIPAL BARNES	Not another word. I'm upset right now -- very upset -- and I think I'm doing you a favor by not reporting you.
F	KATE	Thank you.
M	MR. DAVIES	Kate -- what's going on?
F	KATE	I told Principal Barnes about everything.
M	MR. DAVIES	What? Everything? Did you tell her about...?
F	KATE	Huh? Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm an alcoholic. And that I lied. And she fired me.
M	MR. DAVIES	Oh... ...my god, Kate -- I'm sorry.
F	KATE	I've been going to AA and trying to be sober and this is what it got me. Fired, for telling the truth.
M	MR. DAVIES	I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do.
F	KATE	I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom.
M	MR. DAVIES	No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart woman Kate. You can't let this get you down.
F	KATE	I gotta go.
M	MR. DAVIES	Let me walk you to your car.
M	BARTENDER	What do you need?
F	KATE	Whiskey. Double. Can I have another one?
M	BARTENDER	Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though. Eight bucks.
M	BARTENDER (CONT'D)	Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause I take it you've had a bad day, but um... I think you need to go home.
F	KATE	Why?
M	BARTENDER	Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m.
F	KATE	What about him?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	You're not kicking him out.
M	BARTENDER	I'm just trying to be a pal.
F	KATE	Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA. It didn't work.
M	BARTENDER	Oh, boy...
F	KATE	You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen?
M	BARTENDER	Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry. But this place gets a little nuts after sundown and I don't think a pretty girl who just left AA should be here. I'm gonna call you a cab.
F	KATE	NO! I don't want a cab. I want -- -- drugs. Can you hook me up? C'mon...let's go out back and smoke some crack.
M	BARTENDER	Lady, you're done.
F	KATE	You think I'm above smoking crack? `Cause I'm not. And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...?
M	BARTENDER	No.
F	KATE	Just a teensy bit...?
M	BARTENDER	Not in the slightest.
F	KATE	Well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm smart. And I'm... ...a good person.
M	BARTENDER	I think it's time for you to go home. Now are you gonna let me call a cab?
F	KATE	NO! I'm not. I've got friends. They'll pick me up.
M	BARTENDER	You do that.
F	KATE	I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams about me.
M	BARTENDER	Hope that works out for you.
F	KATE	Can't believe my luck. I just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me. Life is stupid. You hear me? Life is FUCKING STUPID!
F	KATE	Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd you bring her? We're worried about you, Kate.
F	KATE	Parole officer.
M	MR. DAVIES	She's your sponsor.
M	JENNY *	It's gonna be okay. You stumbled. You'll get back up.
F	KATE	How `bout we drive to Mexico and party our asses off? My treat.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Sounds fucking stupendous, right?
M	JENNY *	Kate! Are you sure you're --
F	KATE	Fuck off.
M	CHARLIE	Babe -- you gotta hear this with the speakers hooked up. It's insane. Whoa...what happened to you?
F	KATE	I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.
M	CHARLIE	Oh, no...
F	KATE	We got any drinks?
M	CHARLIE	Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee.
F	KATE	Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean.
M	CHARLIE	So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore?
F	KATE	What gave that away? Come on, baby -- let's do some shots.
M	CHARLIE	What's going on? I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like?
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know what the right thing to do here is.
F	KATE	Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun. Well...here she is.
M	CHARLIE	Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk.
F	KATE	Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me?
M	CHARLIE	I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem.
F	KATE	Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober!
M	CHARLIE	I'm sorry. I didn't realize --
F	KATE	Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me.
M	CHARLIE	What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you.
F	KATE	I love you too. Love is the easy part. It's the rest of the shit that's hard.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Take off your pants.
M	CHARLIE	Look -- I think you should get to sleep. You're really wasted.
F	KATE	I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.
M	CHARLIE	Please, will you stop?
F	KATE	No! I want you to fuck me!
M	CHARLIE	Really. This is weird.
F	KATE	Be a man and fuck your wife!
M	CHARLIE	No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong with you?
F	KATE	With me? With me?! What the fuck is wrong with me? I try hard and I get shit on! Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage. Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with YOU?!
M	CHARLIE	Kate, you need to --
F	KATE	What? What? What do I need? I can't drink because I'm crazy or something and I can't stay sober because of you!
M	CHARLIE	You're blaming other people for your problems.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Stop it! You're acting like a freak!
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	No! What's wrong with you?
F	KATE	I can't be sober and be with you.
M	JENNY *	How's it coming?
F	KATE	You tell me.
M	JENNY *	Delicious. *
F	KATE	Thanks.
M	CHUCK *	At this meeting we give cakes to celebrate sober birthdays. We have one birthday tonight -- for Kate, for one year. Jenny and Dave are giving her the * cake.
F	KATE	Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.
M	GROUP	Hi, Kate.
F	KATE	I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober. Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable. I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't. My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... ...that isn't what I signed up for. Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off." I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	I wasn't happy being the "good-time girl," though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less. I'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but... ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine.
M	OWEN	I was in North Carolina for a while * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball. I had some real heat. That's when I met Crash, here. He'd been sent down to single-A to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player. We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end. He's really taught me some...important life-lessons.
F	MILLIE	Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to meet.
M	OWEN	Yeah. It is.
F	MILLIE	You guys are sorta like that movie...what's it called?
M	OWEN	I don't know. Which one? Do you know what movie she means?
F	MILLIE	"Bull"...something? What is it?
M	MILLIE (CONT'D)	Whatever. It'll come to me. So...what do you do now, Crash?
M	CHARLIE	I write about music.
F	MILLIE	Really?
M	CHARLIE	Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like...
F	MILLIE	Like what?
M	CHARLIE	Huh?
F	MILLIE	You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey.
M	OWEN	So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in "The Show," and what the crowds were like, and --
M	CHARLIE	It was crazy. I...
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a great lady. You have lovely hands and hair but...
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just gonna go.
F	MILLIE	You want a ride...?
M	MILLIE (CONT'D)	Um...is he cool to drive?
M	OWEN	Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his bicycle.
F	MILLIE	He rides a bicycle?
M	OWEN	Oh, yeah -- -- as a teenager, he was a bike racing champion growing up in Bloomington, Indiana. He and his friends were called the "Cutters" -- and they beat a bunch of rich college kids in this big race. It was great.
M	OWEN (CONT'D)	Back then, I was a kickboxing instructor...
M	CHARLIE	So, I got into a little trouble -- drunk in public. On a bicycle. Um, I was thinking...maybe I need to go to one of those meetings. I'd like to go with you, though. If that's cool. Let me know if we could discuss it sometime, okay? Maybe you could come over to our -- um, my house? Uh...yeah. Thanks.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	"Let me know if we could discuss it sometime?" Such an idiot...
M	CHARLIE	Miss our house?
F	KATE	Um...yeah. Sometimes.
M	CHARLIE	Miss me?
F	KATE	Sometimes. I've been sober for a year.
M	CHARLIE	Really?
F	KATE	Yeah.
M	CHARLIE	They gave you that?
F	KATE	Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday.
M	CHARLIE	Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's really...really...just great. I mean it. Tuesday is the night I got pulled over. Parallel lives, huh? So -- you dating anyone?
F	KATE	Charlie...
M	CHARLIE	Are you?
M		
F	KATE	No.
M	CHARLIE	Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his "wing-man" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number. Wanna go out sometime?
F	KATE	I don't think it's a good idea.
M	CHARLIE	I fucked up, didn't I? Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes.
F	KATE	Charlie, please don't do this.
M	CHARLIE	I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's...
F	KATE	I don't like shitty 80's music. I like good 80's music. ...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real. Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot.
F	KATE	You look really thin.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah?
F	KATE	When did you last eat?
M	CHARLIE	I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. I think, um...
F	KATE	Should we order something?
M	CHARLIE	Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich...
F	KATE	I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing.
M	CHARLIE	Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. Have you given up fun, too? Sorry. Bad joke.
F	KATE	Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them.
M	CHARLIE	Okay...
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Sorry.
F	KATE	I don't care if you drink a beer.
M	CHARLIE	You sure?
F	KATE	Yeah. Whatever.
M	CHARLIE	No...I'm good. look a little tired -- like they've been playing a
M	CHARLIE	Have you been playing a lot?
F	KATE	I haven't played in over a year.
M	CHARLIE	Then how're you beating me?
F	KATE	I don't know. Innate talent?
M	CHARLIE	I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.
F	KATE	Um...stick to the game, okay?
M	CHARLIE	I've been masturbating like crazy.
F	KATE	Charlie --
M	CHARLIE	I miss you.
F	KATE	Stop it.
M	CHARLIE	Okay. Fine.
F	KATE	You could've been killed.
M	CHARLIE	What?
F	KATE	Riding your bike -- drunk.
M	CHARLIE	But I wasn't.
F	KATE	But is that really the point?
M	CHARLIE	What are trying to say?
F	KATE	I worry about you.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, I can understand that. I used to worry about you. But now I know you're okay. That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well. Would you move back in if I came to meetings?
F	KATE	You should go for yourself, not to make me happy.
M	CHARLIE	But, would you?
F	KATE	I'm not moving back in.
M	KATE (CONT'D)	Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon.
M	CHARLIE	We can always turn the lights on.
F	KATE	I don't know...
M		
M	CHARLIE	So, would you at least...let me take you out on a date?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Maybe...?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Okay...fine. 0 for 2. Last question: can we just...play one more game? C'mon...you keep kicking my ass. It's embarrassing. You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself. Please.
