M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	MS. BERRY	"Work." Today we're going to share what our parents do for work. QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
M	JEFF	My dad is a truck driver.
M	MELINDA	My mommy is a doctor.
M	CAROLYN	My dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian.
M	THEODORE	My father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear. My mother is an actress. She works at Denny's.
M	KELLY	My daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy.
M	ELLIOT	My father is a postal worker. The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:
M	MAX	My mom's a teacher. As Max starts to sit:
F	MS. BERRY	And your dad? My dad? He's . . . a liar.
F	MS. BERRY	
M	A liar? I don't think you	mean "a liar."
M	MAX	Well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and-- Oh! I see-- you mean he's a lawyer.
M	FLETCHER	A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife?
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card. As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. You want to help. First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. Finally, you leap into the man's Lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. You breathe a sigh of relief: "Someone to look -after the injured man! Oh joy!" But do the police applaud your initiative? Do they hail your heroism? No-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer! He walks along the jury box: 路 And why? Why does the State turn its massive power against this individual?
M	IMPRESSIVE	moment, then answers his own Discrimination, But this time it's not based on race. Not based on gender. Not based on religion, No--this time it's discrimination based on size! . I know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault. Is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large? Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor! Shame on you! The state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of Justice. Only you can douse the flames. The decision is your s. And please...don't let your emotions run away with y ou . The fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case. In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower! Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.
M	LAWYER	How's it going, Fletcher?
M	FLETCHER	Another gratifying day serving Justice. Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.
M	CLIENT	Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation.
M	FLETCHER	Stay out of my neighborhood after dark. A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.
M	PUBLICIST	Mr. Reid, do you have a 路 moment-?
M	FLETCHER	No, I'm late picking up my son.
M	PUBLICIST	-Because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today. Fletcher instantly shifts directions. How's my hair? And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.
M	MAX	What time is it?
F	AUDREY	I ' m sure he just got tied up in court again. Finally, Fletcher's BMW pulls up. Max races to him,
M	MAX	Dad!
M	FLETCHER	Maximillian! Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the
M	FLETCHER	Malfunction in vector 3 ! ! Malfunction in vector 3!! Look out! It's on tickle mode!! Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes CLAW-LIKE, TICKLING MAX Audrey watches these two kids, smiles.
M	FLETCHER	And who is this lovely lady? Max, could you introduce me?
M	MAX	That's no lady, that's mom!
M	AUDREY. 路	Thanks, Max. Mom? ! Himnm. . . I don't remember her looking that good, Malfunction in Vector 4! Malfunction in Vector 4! Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes Keep Vector 4 away from me. Unless you want Vector 4 chopped off.
M	FLETCHER	You know, you were much easier when we were married... So where are you off too?
F	AUDREY	Stanford. I'm delivering a paper.
M	FLETCHER	O h really? Where I live, we use a boy on a bike.
M	MAX	Hey mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling! Oh, Fletcher! Oh, Audrey!
F	AUDREY	Do you have to take him to tho se things? They're so violent.
M	FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE	The boy must learn the way of the war rior . An d wh o be tter to teach him than Rowdy Rod- . Piper and Big John Stud? Audrey can't help but LAUGH.
M	FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE	He must be schooled in the way of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple. For only then-- Shut up!!
M	FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE	The squaw will never understand us. A HORN HONKS. It's the good-natured, affable JERRY. Max
M	JERRY	Max, my man! Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips.
M	JERRY	Fletcher, good to see you?
M	FLETCHER	What? No kiss for me?
M	JERRY	What do you say, Max? Give me a hand? Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback
M	FLETCHER	I didn't know the boyfriend was going.
F	AUDREY	Jerry. His name is Jerry and yes, he's going. Audrey heads inside.
M	FLETCHER	T o Stanford? Overnight? Does this mean you two are...
F	AUDREY	I've been seeing him seven months, what do you think?
M	FLETGHER	I was hoping that after being married to me, you'd have no more strength left.
F	AUDREY	. Well you have to remember when we were married, I wasn't having sex nearly as often as you were.
M	FLETCHER	MEDIC!! I've been hit.
M	FLETCHER	Well, great... I'm so happy for you two. I am just Mister H appy man. Happy, happy, happy.
F	AUDREY	Relax, Fletcher. It looks like Jerry's taking that job offer in Boston. Fletcher turns sincere.
M	FLETCHER	Aud, I am so sorry...
M	JERRY	Ready? Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max. They get in his
M	FLETCHER	Yo u gonna be okay? Because if not, we could leave Max with your sister and I could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all? They drive off.
M	FLETCHER	Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, Max. You drive.
M	MAX	Dad, are we really going to go to wrestling?
M	FLETCHER	Absolutely, Maxattacker. We just have to stop by the office for one minute. Max SIGHS. He's heard this before.
M	KONIGSBERG.	As they head inside, Fletcher and Max pass a BEGGAR.
M	BEGGAR	'Scuse me, sir. Do you have any change?
M	FLETCHER	'Fraid not. Sorry. On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass PHILIP,
M	PHILIP	Fletcher!
M	FLETCHER	Philip!
M	PHILIP	And this must be Max!
M	FLETCHER	. Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was good seeing you-- Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.
M	PHILIP	You know, Ethel and I had a blast at our last little get- together.
M	FLETCHER	Oh, me too. I can never get enough of charades. We'll have to do it again sometime. Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the
M	PHILIP	When?
M	FLETCHER	Soon. The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.
M	PHILIP	How 'bout tonight?
M	FLETCHER	Not that soon. I'm taking Max to see wrestling--
M	PHILIP	We love wrestling. We could--
M	FLETCHER	I don't think so. See, Max is really shy around strangers. Max looks up at Fletcher. He isn't. Tell you what -- give me your card as a reminder. I'll call y o u . Soon. Promise.
M	PHILIP	Great! Philip hands him his card just as the door closes.
F	JANE	Hi, Mr. Reid. What do you think?
M	FLETCHER	Fabulous! I love it. What's this?
F	JANE	I don't know who sent it. But it's for Mr. Allan. It's his anniversary.
M	FLETCHER	Ah... The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday?
F	JANE	Yep... Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket,
M	MAX	What are you doing?
M	FLETCHER	Oh, I'm... fixing the card, Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong. Have an apple.
M	FRED	I can't do it.
M	M IRANDA	present the strongest case possible.
M	FRED	The strongest case possible, consistent with the truth.
F	MIRANDA	Let the Judge decide what's true. That's what he gets paid for. You get paid to win.
M	FRED	If you insist on my taking it to trial, I'll represent Mrs. Cole aggressively and ethically. But, Miranda -- I won't lie. Miranda looks out her window, calculating.
F	MIRANDA	Then we'll just have to find someone who'will.
M	FLETCHER	Hey, Pete! Great tie! 路. Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.
M	FLETCHER	Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight. THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's
M	THOMAS	Gained three pounds.
M	FLETCHER	On you, it works. Fletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the
M	GRETA '	M ax ! What's new?
M	.MAX	Well. . . it's my birthday tomo rrow. We're having a party and everything. Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten.
M	GRE TA	I'm sure your dad'11 give you something wonderful. Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max
M	MAX	Yeah?
M	FLETCHER	Oh, yeah. You're going to love it. Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone, have a good time. We'll be leaving in a second.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Damn! I completely forgot.
F	GRETA	Oh, there's a surprise. Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.
M	FLETCHER	You're a saint. I should get you something.
F	GRETA	You did. She holds up another, smaller package.
M	FLETCHER	Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing. Any calls? She hands him a stack of mail.
F	GRETA	. Let's see.. . 路 Judge Patterson's clerk. He needs your filing.
M	FLETCHER	Tell him it's in the mail.
F	GRETA	Right. You'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley phoned, questioning that fourteen hours you billed on Christinas Eve.
M	FLETCHER	Write him a long, explanatory letter. Then bill him for the letter.
F	GRETA	. note). .. Done. Your mother called.
M	FLETCHER	I ' m on vacation.
F	GRETA	This is your fifth week. . 路 .
M	FLETCHER	It's a long vacation.
F	GRETA	"Break mother's heart." Done. And that's it, except Miranda's looking for you.
M	FLETCHER	As if I don't have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet. Tell her I'm in court.
F	GRETA	Court's closed.
M	FLETCHER	Tell her I broke my leg and had to be shot. Why don't you tell her yourself? As Miranda approaches, Fletcher switches gears in an
M	FLETCHER	--And then send out a notice of judgement on my win today! I'll get right on it. Fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised.
M	FLETCHER	Miranda! I didn't see you. Hey, you look lovely, today. Here, I bought you a gift.
F	MIRANDA	Thanks. I heard about your victory today. You're making quite an impression on the partnership committee. Oh, that's right. You folks are meeting again soon. "Allan, Stewart, Konigsberg, and Ried." There's something about the rhythm of fours. It's like a full measure. Well, anyway, I've got a client waiting in my office--
M	MIRANDA .	Actually, something important h as come up. You're not busy tonight, are you? Before Fletcher answers, we:
M	MAX	We're not going, are we?
M	FLETCHER	Of course we are. A promise i s a promise. We are gonna see wrestling or my name isn't Fletcher T. Reid.
M	FLETCHER	Could you hand me that? Thank you. We are having some fun, eh Maxer? PUSH IN on Max; he isn't.
F	AUDREY	Are you alright?
M	JERRY	Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long are you gonna be on the phone?
F	AUDREY	I just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, Will you marry me? She's SHOCKED. Uh...would I . . . ? What did you say? I proposed, I . . . Look, I know this Boston thing is a great opportunity, good job, mo ney .. . everything. But I started to think about being three thousand miles away from you and Max. And I didn't like it. I-- Look, I know it's a lot to ask, to move and everything, but I . . . . I love you marry me? She stares at him, excited, but nervous.
M	FLETCHER	Max Factor... Happy birthday. How old are you today? T h ir t y ? Forty?
M	MAX	Five.
M	FLETCHER	Well, you've held up well. I only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like.... Fletcher produces --
M	FLETCHER	. . . A present! .
M	MAX	What is it?
M	FLETCHER	It's... it's. a surprise. Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the
M	MAX	Baseball stuff! Baseball stuff.
M	MAX	Will you play catch with me?
M	Absorootentootenlutely.	Max beams.
M	FLETCHER	Tonight. After your party, you have my word on it. Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.
M	AUDR EY	Jerry, these are for tomorrow.
M	JERRY	The company wants me to get started right away.
F	AUDREY	I can't just pick up and move to Boston with two days notice.
M	JERRY	Ju st come check it out. You a nd Max, see the town. Let's . pick out a place together. Then, if you want to turn me down and scar me for life, fine.
F	AUDREY	It's just not that simple... What about my job? I've been at UCLA three years.
M	JERRY	It's New England. They're lousy with colleges. You can't swing a bat back there without hitting a college. second.
F	AUDREY	There are other factors involved. T here they are now. 路. They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher
F	AUDREY	Did you have fun? How were the wrestling matches?
M	FLETCHER	Big fun. Manly fun. Am I right, Maxie? It was fun..
M	FLETCHER	So how were the wrestling matches ? Did you have fun?
M	JERRY	Max , my man! My happy birthday man! Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug. Jerry gives Max
M	JERRY	One-two-three-four-five... and one for good luck.
M	FLETCHER	Did you see that? He struck the child!
M	MAX	Look what dad got me!
M	JERRY	Whoa! Great! I have my glove in the car. We'll stop in the park on the way home and play c atch. Then tonight we'll oil
M	it, wrap a rubber band around	it. . . It'll be great. Great birthday present, dad! Fletcher hates him. Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.
M	FLETCHER 路.	When is it his birthday?
F	AUDREY	Some thing's come up. We need to talk.
M	MAX	Mom, let's go. I want to play.
F	AUDREY	We'll talk tonight.
M	FLETCHER	Tonight?
F	AUDREY	Max's birthday?
M	FLETCHER'	Oh , yeah, right. Seven. I knew that. I did. I blocked it out weeks ago. The se ven tee nt h of May. Max's birthday.
F	AUDREY	It's the eighteenth.
M	FLETCHER	The seventeenth of May is the day I .remind myself that the eighteenth is Max's birthday. See you tonight. They drive away.
M	VIRGINIA	This is good. This is really smart.
M	FLETCHER	Thank you.
M	VIRGINIA	Only i t ' s . . . Like not true. Every word of it is a lie. Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances. I mean... isn't that a problem?
M	FLETCHER	here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- They are his?
M	VIRGINIA	H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.
M	FLETCHER	After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of
M	VIRGINIA	Seven.
M	FLETCHER	Hm?
M	VIRGINIA	Seven single acts of indiscretion.
M	FLETCHER	--Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for.
M	VIRGINIA	He is?
M	FLETCHER	Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--
M	VIRGINIA	Seven.
M	FLETCHER	--Seven .other men. You're not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his. All you're insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more. I think you're bending over backwards.
M	VIRGINIA	Well, I did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids... He's always been a good father.
M	FLETCHER	And you've always been a good wife.
M	VIRGINIA	Yeah. . .
M	FLETCHER	There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. All I'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf. Will you give me that opportunity?
M	VIRGINIA	Yes! I ' m tired of getting kicked around.
M	FLETCHER	Good for you!
M	VIRGINIA	Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so grateful I have an attorney I can trust. S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
F	MIRANDA	You're good. You're really good.
M	FLETCHER	Oh, pshaw. She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.
F	MIRANDA	N o, I mean it. The Cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e . You win this case and I guarantee you'll make partner. Actually, how would you like to make a partner right now?
M	FLETCHER	Excuse me? She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS. Captain Fuzzy is my name, Making children happy is my game, With a shake and a juggle, And a big belt buckle, You'll all be glad I came. ' He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to
F	AUDREY	What do you think?
M	JERRY	Well, if you don't hire your brother, who will? She heads into...
M	JERRY	They called me again from B oston. They really want me there tomorrow.
F	AUDREY	. . . I can't go to Boston.
M	JERRY	How come?
F	AUDREY	Max.
M	JERRY	He'll love it there.
F	AUDREY	It's Fletcher.
M	JERRY	Fletcher?
F	AUDREY	I can't move Max three thousand miles away from his father.
M	JERRY	Audrey, I have never said a bad word about your ex --
F	AUDREY	I know.
M	JERRY	But how much responsibility does Fletcher take for Max, now? He'd never come over if you didn't remind him.
F	AUDREY	I know. But if they're three thousand miles apart they'll never see each other. Fletcher will never come to Boston and how can I send Max cross-country to him?
M	.JERRY	So because your ex-husband is unreliable, we can't-'-
F	AUDREY	I know, it's not logical, it's emotional. I'm sorry. Pause.
M	JERRY	I still want to marry you.
F	AUDREY	Are you sure? Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper,
M	JERRY	Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry She!ton... I hope I'm not calling too late... Mr. Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have to turn down your offer..'. So am I . . . Well, I've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in L.A. and she doesn't want to leave and I won't leave without her... Well, thank you very much... Yes, good-bye. He wasn't there, but that's 1 the speech I would've made. She smiles and KISSES him. The PHONE RINGS. Audrey
F	AUDREY	Hello...
M	A UDREY	Fletcher, where are you? We're getting ready to cut the cake.
M	FLETCHER	Urn, actually, something has come up. A problem on a new caaa-- . Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.
M	F LET CHE R	A-h-h-h-!
F	AUDREY	What happened?
M	FLETCHER	Nothing. I just nailed my 路knee into the desk... Listen, I'm really sorry I can't 'make it.
F	AUDREY	Max is going to be so disappointed.
M	FLETCHER	I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?
F	AUDREY	Do you want me to put him on the phone? Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.
M	FLETCHER	Ah, no. I have to go. Right. ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the
F	AUDREY	All right, birthday boy, make a wish. Max doesn't respond. C'mon, honey. It can be anything-- whatever you want most in the world. When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..
M	AUDREY (CONT'D)	Max, your dad is sorry. He had to work.
M	MAX	He said he was coming. He promised.
F	AUDREY	Yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow. Max doesn't believe it. < He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake. In
M	MAX (V.O.)	I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A A clock on a wall. It's 9:15'. We are-- To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
F	MIRANDA	S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
M	FLETCHER	I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
M	FLETCHER	"I've had better?"
M	FLETCHER	"I've had better?!"
M	FLETCHER	"I've had better?" I t arrives. He steps in.
M	FLETCHER	New in the building?
M	MODEL	I just moved in Monday.
M	FLETCHER	Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour. O h? Do you do that for all the new tenants?
M	FLETCHER	No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...
M	BEGGAR	Any change, Mister?
M	.FLETCHER	Absolutely. But he continues walking.
M	BEGGAR	Could you spare some?
M	FLETCHER	Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
M	BEGGAR	Will you?
M	FLETCHER	No.
M	BEGGAR	How come?
M	FLETCHER	Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs...
M	BEGGAR	Jerkoff.
M	VIRGINIA	You look like you're having a rough morning.
M	FLETCHER	I've had better. He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely
F	DANA	Good morning, Fletcher.
M	FLETCHER	Dana. "
M	RICHARD	All right, Virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this?
M	FLETCHER	Fifty per cent of your estate. Richard is SHOCKED.
F	DANA	Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case?
M	FLETCHER	Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
M	DANA .	Interesting, though based on your track record, I expected a little more. Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
M	FLETCHER ..	Wa it! Wait! I've got it in writing! But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
F	DANA	Let go!
M	FLETCHER	I'm trying!
M	BAILIFF	All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens.
F	DANA	Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play hardball, I'm game. JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Calling case BA 09395, Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole. How're we doing this morning, counsel?
F	DANA	Fine, thank you.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	And you, Mr. Reid?
M	FLETCHER	Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what Well, you're still young. It'll happen more and more. In the meantime, what do you say we get. down to business? First, Mr. Reid, I see that your client was previously represented by Mr. Rand of your office.
M	FLETCHER	Yes, Your Honor.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
M	FLETCHER	Yes, Your Honor.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Fine , fine. And for the record, the reason is?
M	FLETCHER	Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
M	JUDGE STEVENS	I take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr. Reid?
M	FLETCHER	I have lower standards, Your Honor.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel, I'll allow it. Is that what you want, Mrs. Cole? Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose Yes?
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Fine.
M	VIRGINIA	What are you doing? I don't know. Your Honor, I ' d like a continuance!
M	JUDGE STEVENS "	This case has already been delayed several times, Mr. Reid.
M	FLETCHER	I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem?
M	FLETCHER	I can't lie! Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm still waiting for the good caus e. Now, do you have it or . not? Not.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case?
F	DANA	I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to -- Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel.
F	DANA	Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.
M	FLETCHER	It certainly does.
F	DANA	However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.
M	FLETCHER	Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
M	JUDGE STEVENS	What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?
M	FLETCHER	No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers.
F	DANA	Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. She brandishes the audiotape.
M	JUDGE SAMIOAN	Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite explanation, I'd say you're dead in the water. How's you client's story?
M	FLETCHER	The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor. 路
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Strong corroborating evidence?
M	FLETCHER	We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?
M	FLETCHER	"Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana
F	DANA	All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more. Bastard! She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.
M	VIRGINIA	No! We are --
M	FLETCHER	No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,
M	FIND-NO-LINE-AT-THE-FRIGGIN'-	DMV miracle! You've gone from two point four to four point eight million in... four minutes. Think of it this way -- now you're getting paid seven hundred thou per schtupp!
M	VIRGINIA	Mr. Reid, you convinced me yesterday -- I'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--
M	FLETCHER	Seven! 路
M	VIRGINIA	-- Seven other men. With the story you came up with, I don't think I can lose. I want to proceed.
M	FLETCHER	Mrs. Cole, you don't 路. understand, I-- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a settlement? Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
M	JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)	Th ere' s no settlement. Trial to start at one-thirty sharp. He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.
F	JANE	What do you think?
M	FLETCHER .	I think you need help. HORRIFI ED, Fletcher hurries on. The heavyset Thomas
M	THOMAS	What's shakin', Fletcher?
M	FLETCHER	Your cellulite, Tubster. The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.
M	FRED	Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the Cole case going?
M	FLETCHER	'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it.
M	P	Fletcher is RUNNING NOW, COVERING HIS EARS and SINGING
F	路 GRETA	Hi, boss. What's happening
M	PLEASE DON'T ASK!	-- And races into his office. Do n't panic. You can beat this -- it's all a matter of willpower. He dives for his desk and rifles through it.
M	FL ET CH ER	A test. . . Something small... Aha! He holds up a BLUE PEN.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Red. Red. All right. Focus, The color of this pen is 路 r--. R--. R--! The color of this pen is--blue! AAAAHH! Ahhhh! One' tiny lie and I can't say it!! ' I'll write.it! He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes "This pen
M	INADVERTENTLY:	"This pen is blue." Greta enters to find-- FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in
F	GRETA	Boss, what's wrong?
M	FLETCHER	. The pen is blue!! The pen is . b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS
M	BLUE !!!	Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment --
F	GRETA	Red? FLETCHER Oh, that's easy for you to say?!
F	GRETA	Are you all right?
M	FLETCHER	I have to go home.
F	GRETA	Home? Was the case settled?
M	FLETCHER	No. I have to be in court at one-thirty.
F	GRETA	Well, then how can you.go home?
M	FLETCHER	I don't know, I don't know!!!
F	GRETA	Okay. Before I forget -- Rubin and Dun n called. They want to know where the Darvis settlement offer stands.
M	FLETCHER	I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it. . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot,
F	GRETA	'路...dick with them." Okay. Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together. .
M	FLETCHER	I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar..
F	GRETA	Got it. And your mother called again. Are you still on vacation? No.
F	GRETA	So then you're here? Yes.
F	GRETA	I ' m having a little trouble following you. what do I say to your mom? Tell her I'm a thoughtless son who'd rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her-- but only if she asks. You.might also add that she deserves better, though I hope to God you don't.
F	GRETA	Thanks for clearing that up. And that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son. He reacts, particularly stunned by this truth.
M	AUDREY'	Hey, Fletcher. T was wondering if you were going to still pick up Max after school today.
M	FLETCHER	I don't think I can. I had a case I was certain would settle and it didn't. I have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me.
F	AUDREY	Right.
M	FLETCHER	It's true... I really do want to see Max, today. Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	How about that. I really do. But things keep coming up at the last minute.
M	FLETCHER	Yes, but-this time it's different.
F	AUDREY	I see. And how is that?
M	FLETCHER	This time I'm telling the truth.
F	AUDREY	But last night you weren't?
M	FLETCHER	No.
F	AUDREY	What were you doing?
M	FLETCHER	Having sex.
F	AUDREY	It must have been with someone very "special."
M	FLETCHER	No. It was with someone I don't even like. But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that attending my son's birthday!
M	A U D R EY	M y God!! She SLAMS DOWN the phone. Audrey gets out. She leans over to say good-bye to her
M	MAX	Is dad picking me up?
F	AUDREY	No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed.
M	MAX	I guess my wish didn't come 路 true.
F	AUDREY	What wish?
M	MAX	I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved.
M	FLETCHER	Answer, answer, answer... Hello.
M	FLETCHER	Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me--
F	AUDREY	Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you. What do you mean?
F	AUDREY	Max and I are moving to Boston.
M	FLETCHER	What?!
F	AUDREY	Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here.
M	FLETCHER	Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him.
F	AUDREY	Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now.
M	FLETCHER	Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone?
F	AUDREY	That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye.
M	FLETCHER	Where are you?
F	AUDREY	Heading home.
M	FLETCHER	there. I'll be right over. We have to talk.
M	FLETCHER	I'll be right- there! Aaaah!
F	MIRANDA	Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher. I must confess-- after last night's incident, I was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner. Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	But then I thought, "No, that 's not fair. Fletcher didn't mean to insult me." "It was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and Fletcher is very, very sorry." Fletcher smiles. It looks like he's off the hook, until--
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Isn't that right, Fletcher?
M	FLETCHER	Uh -- not really, no.
F	MIRANDA	N o ? No?! What are you sayi ng? Have you no respect for me?!
M	FLETCHER	None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I would.
M	M IRANDA	But -- what about last night?
M	FLETCHER	I was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for sexual conquests.
M	FLETCHER	Gotta focus. . . gotta focus. He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
M	FLETCHER	The color of the pen is -- re d ! . But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
M	DRIVER	What's your problem, schmuck?!
M	FLETCHER	I ' m an inconsiderate prick!
M	FLETCHER (CON "ID)	C'mon, you can do this! The color of the pen is -- RED! This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
M	FLETC HER	S hi t !!
M	POLICE OFFICER	Do you know why I stopped you?
M	FLETCHER	Depends on how long you were following me.
M	POLICE OFFICER	Why don't we take it from the top.
M	FLETCHER	Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the
M	INTERSECTION-WITHOUT	signalling while running a red light and speeding. A long moment.
M	POLICE OFFICER	May I see your driver's license?
M	FLETCHER	No.
M	POLICE OFFICER	And why is that?
M	FLETCHER	It's in my other pants.
M	POLICE OFFICER	I see. And where are your 路 other pants?
M	FLETCHER	Hanging from my boss's credenza.
M	POLICE OFFICER	Do you expect me to believe that?
M	FLETCHER	No.
M	POLICE OFFICER	Do you think I'm an idiot?
M	FLETCHER	Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't!
M	POLICE OFFICER	I see. So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?
M	FLETCHER	I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise. Unpaid parking tickets. Be gentle. Audrey, wait!
F	AUDREY	Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait.
M	FLETCHER	I can explain--
F	AUDREY	I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab?
M	FLETCHER	Yes.
F	AUDREY	Where's your car?
M	FLETCHER	Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me.
F	AUDREY	I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.
M	FLETCHER	Ow.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	You scratched my car!
M	TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE	Where? .
M	FLETCHER	Right there!
M	TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE	Oh that? That was already there. Why, you -- you liar! Do you know what I ' m going to do about this?
M	TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE	What?
M	FLETCHER	...Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if I finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what I'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe!
M	TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE	You've been here before, haven't you? He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.
F	AUDREY	Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out.
M	FLETCHER	Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation. What do you want to say?
M	FLETCHER	You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.
F	AUDREY	Let' s define "fair." Last 路 night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?
M	FLETCHER	Last night--
F	AUDREY	-- Was none of my business. When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now I don't have to care anymore. See, that's the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max. Everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.
M	FLETCHER	All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very I have an idea. I'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with M ax. Have him invite some fri ends over. We'll have a game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk.
F	AUDREY	We're suppose to be on a plane
M	FLETCHER	No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too.
F	AUDREY	You're really coming?
M	FLETCHER	This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time?
F	AUDREY	...Six?
M	FLETCHER	Ten-to-six. All right... only if I tell Max you're coming and you don't show up and I have to see that look on Max's face -- that heartbreaking look-- it's Boston, Fletcher.
M	FLETCHER.	I will be there. I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
M	FLETCHER	Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!
M	MAX	Dad! Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms. Berry, Max's teacher!
M	FLETCHER	Hi. Listen, I need to talk to
F	MS. BERRY	Mr. Reid, we were just talking ab ou t careers. You're a lawyer, aren't you? Yes.
M	MAX	Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers!
M	FLETCHER	Well, actually-- 路
F	MS. BERRY	Children! .Mr. Reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer. She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center
M	FLETCHER	Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out.
F	MS. BERRY	One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe some of the children have
M	QUESTIONS	Jeffrey?
M	JEFF	What kind of lawyer are you?
M	FLETCHER	Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.
M	BILLY	What's that?
M	FLETCHER	It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me.
M	CRAIG	So what do you do?
M	FLETCHER	I help people fight over their money and their children.
M	THEODORE	Can't they fight without you?
M	FLETCHER ' "	They could but then J wouldn't make a living.
M	JILL	Why would my daddy leave my mommy?
M	FLETCHER	To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then: Well, I think it's time for fingerpainting.
M	FLETCHER	Monster-Max.
M	MAX	Dadzilla. You came to play catch?
M	FLETCHER	No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen?
M	MAX	Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair...
M	FLETCHER	That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
M	' MAX .	I want to play kickball with my friends.-
M	FLETCHER	Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed.
M	MAX	Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?
M	FLETCHER	Yes. No matter what?
M	FLETCHER	No matter what.
M	MAX	Is wrestling real?
M	FLETCHER	In the Olympics, yes. On . Channel 23, no.
M	MAX	Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?
M	FLETCHER	Not in a million years.
M	MAX	If I keep making this face-- will it get stuck that way?
M	FLETCHER	Uh-uh.
M	MAX	.If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?
M	FLETCHER	Only if you can't 'swim.
M	MAX	Why do I have to eat squash?
M	FLETCHER	Because your mom buys it.
M	MAX	How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels
M	FLETCHER	I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together.
M	MAX	Baseball?
M	FLETCHER	. Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.
M	FLETCHER	Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.
M	MAX	So you can lie?
M	FLETCHER	Not to you.
M	MAX	To who?
M	FLETCHER	Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me "How do I lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods.
M	MAX	You didn't think she was beautiful.
M	FLETCHER	Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head "no." Will you help me anyway? A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	That's my boy! Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He
M	MAX	I did it. ^
M	FLETCHER	Great! Great! Now to test --
M	SLAPS HIM.	Fletcher returns to his son.
M	MAX	Did it work?
M	FLETCHER . .	Not like I ' d hoped. Did you really unwish it? Max nods.
M	MAX	Only...
M	FLETCHER	Only what?
M	MAX	Yesterday, when I wished it, I r ea lly meant it. This time when I unwished it I only did it 'cause you told me to.
M	FLETCHER	Well, then do it again. Only this time, mean it.
M	MAX	I can't.
M	FLETCHER	Why not?!
M	MAX	Because I don't want you to lie.
M	FLETCHER	I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--
M	MAX	But you're the only one who makes me feel bad. Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts. Max, recess 'is over, come on in.
M	MAX	I have to go.
M	FLETCHER	I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods. I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks
M	MACHO ATTORNEY	Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging?
M	FLETCHER	Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He
M	PHILIP	Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card --
M	FLETCHER	No --
M	PHILIP	Or my phone was busy --
M	FLETCHER	No -- Or you just forgot --
M	FLETCHER	No --
M	PHILIP	Or something. So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty! Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely.
M	FLETCHER	Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --
M	PHILIP	Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off. Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.
F	GRETA	Do you want your messages?
M	FLETCHER	No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned. She follows
F	GRETA	Are you okay?
M	FLETCHER	My son hates me.
F	GRETA	No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero.
M	FLETCHER	O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a 路wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.
F	GRETA	Kids...
M	FLETCHER	It came true.
F	GRETA	What?
M	FLETCHER	It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?
F	GRETA	Well, yeah, but... You're telling me that you can't lie.
M	FLETCHER	That's right! I am incapable of lying.
F	GRETA	Just today?
M	FLETCHER	Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse.
F	GRETA	Yes, those are going around.
M	FLETCHER	You don't believe me.
F	GRETA	Of course not.
M	FLETCHER	Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.
F	GRETA	A ll right. Remember a few months ago, I wanted a raise-- Forget it. Let's not do this.
F	GRETA	-- and the firm wouldn't.give me one. And I asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough?
M	FLETCHER	Greta, please... Yes Judge Stevens, hi!.. Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? Am I ill? He wants to say "yes", but he can't.
M	FLETCHER	In a way. Please, lie to him for me. Greta holds up a framed photograph.
F	GRETA	I remember when you. bought me t hi s silver frame. From Tiffany's. . . . Tiffany's?
M	FLETCHER	Jumbo's House of Junk. She thrpws it in the trash and keeps packing.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	I'll give you the raise!
F	GRETA	Here's your raise.
M	FLETCHER	Hi, Judge Stevens?... Yes, I know I haven't given you a reason. The PHONE RINGS.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	But if you could just do this for me, I-- The phone won't stop ringing. .路'
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Hold on, please, Hello... Mom!! The phone flies into the air. He catches it. Mom... Well, I wasn't actually on vacation... Because I didn't want to talk to you... Because you insist on talking to me about Dad's bowel movements -- size, color, frequency... I'll call you later... No, not really. He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Oh dammit! I cut him off! I cut off the Judge! Greta... He falls to his knees.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	I'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit. Don't leave. Greta stops. She seems to consider.
F	GRETA	A few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof.
M	FLETCHER	Yes?
M	GRETA ..	A burglar. -He fell through the kitchen skylight and landed on a cutting board on a butcher's knife, cutting his l e g. He sued my friend. The Thanks to guys like you-- he won. My friend had to pay him six thousand dollars. Is that justice?
M	FLETCHER	No. . . but what' s your poijit!
F	GRETA	My point is, it's hard to get justice. But this is justice, Have a nice day in court, bubbie. She leaves. Fletcher starts to give chase... He runs directly into Miranda.
M	FLETCHER	Aaaah! Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.
F	MIRANDA	Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you. Are you busy?
M	FLETCHER	Extremely.
F	MIRANDA	Good. Would you follow me, please? Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.
M	MIRANDA (CONT'D)	Fletcher, did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by Mr. Allan himself? Say, you used to work directly for Mr. Allan, didn't you? Tell me, what do you think of him? FLETCHER He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. How delightful! She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --
F	MIRANDA	Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid. 路It's good to see you again, Fletcher. '. An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.
F	MIRANDA	Oh, that's right. You used to work together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah? Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's
F	MIRANDA	I said... What do you think of Mr. Allan?
M	FLETCHER .	He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous
M	MR. ALLAN	Marvelous! Marvelous! That's what I love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship! Miranda is incensed. And thanks for those flowers for my anniversary. My wife loved them.
M	FLETCHER	Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye.
M	BAILIFF	All rise. They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Counselors, are we ready to begin?
M	FLETCHER	N o sir! We are not ready to b eg in. My client has not arrived. The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN -- until now. Did you and Mrs. Cole ever make lo-- forni-- roll in the h-- make the beast with two ba -- Did you two ever fu-- fu-- Fu! He begins to hyperventilate. Virginia turns to Falk.
M	VIRGINIA	Wate r! Get him water! Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.
M	FLETCHER	Fu-- fu--
M	VIRGINIA	S it down! Get some air! Try to relax! Breathe deeply! Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who
M	VIRGINIA (CONT'D)	W hat?! What?!
M	FALK	I couldn't find any water, so I got him coffee! Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning
M	BAILIFF	Judge is taking the bench. Fletcher's expression turns to terror.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	You may proceed, Mr. Reid. . Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation. In a voice
M	VIRGINIA	Sorry. One of the kids threw up in the car. Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children You brought your kids. . . to your divorce?
M	VIRGINIA	Sympathy.
M	FLETCHER	Well, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. The judge BANGS the gavel.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Ms. Appleton, you may begin. Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator.
M	BRYSON	-- From March six through June twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole at the behest of Mr. Cole. During that period, I noted that Mr. Cole left each day between seven-forty and seven- fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay for one to four hours. I was able to take several photographs of the male visitor. He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A
F	DANA	I see. And do you .know what Mrs. Cole and her male visitor visits?
M	BRYSON	Well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn -- but I sure was able to hear. I made an audiotape of one such., "session." H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.
F	DANA	With the Court's permission, I would like to play the tape.
M	FLETCHER	Your Honor, I object!
M	JUDGE STEVENS	And why is that, Mr. Reid?
M	FLETCHER	Because it's devastating to my 路case. The judge is startled by his candor.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Overruled.. As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the So , what did you say? You ready?
M	VIRGINIA (O.S.)	Oh boy am I ready.
M	MALE VISITOR (O.S.)	Good. Let me help you off with that. Come on, lie down. Wai t a minute. Do you have protection? Right here. Okay, now I ' m gonna show you something new.
M	VIRGINIA ( O . S . )	Oh, I've never done it like this before. .路.
M	MALE VISITOR (O.S.)	Don't worry, you can take it. Oh yeah. That's it. There you go. Yes! Yes! WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.
M	MALE VISITOR (O.S) (CONT'D)	Yes, yes, yes -- As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
M	MALE VISITOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Oh yeah, bring it on .home -- yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! YES! The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-
F	DANA	Your witness.
M	FLETCHER	No questions.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	No questions? .
M	VIRGINIA	No questions?
M	FLETCHER	No questions. Petitioner rests.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed.
M	FLETCHER	How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break?
M	JUDGE STEVENS	It can't wait?
M	FLETCHER	Not unless you want to mop up. All right, but get back in here immediately so .we can finish this. Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.
M	FLETCHER	What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.
M	MAN	What's going on in-there? I ' m abusing myself! Do you mind?! The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.
M	BAILIFF	I found him like this in the bathroom. Somebody beat the hell out of him.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Who did this? A madman, Your Honor.. A desperate fool at the end of his pitiful.rope.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	-What did he look like? About five eleven, hundred eighty-five pounds, crazed look in his eye.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.
M	JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)	Under the circumstances, I have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine. Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --
M	JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)	-- Unless, of course, you think you can still proceed? Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid Can you?
M	FLETCHER	Yes, I can.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Splendid. I admire your courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started. Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.
M	FLETCHER	Hello.
M	MAX	Dad...
M	FLETCHER	Maxi-pad. How's it going?
M	MAX	Great. You know Paul and Emanuel from across the street?
M	FLETCHER	The twins. Well, they never want to play baseball with me, but I told them I was gonna play tonight with my Dad, so now they want to play with us. Is it okay?
M	FLETCHER	Sure.
M	MAX	Oh boy. We're setting up a whole field in the yard. Where we buried Petey the hamster is second base. You're still coming right?'
M	FLETCHER	I'11 be there. I gotta go now, Max. I'll see you in two hours. Max hangs up.
M	MAX	He's really coming. She smiles, but she's worried. .
M	VIRGINIA	Mr. Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the man from the tape.
M	FALK	How are you?
M	FLETCHER	I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.
M	VIRGINIA	Shouldn't we go over our testimony?
M	FLETCHER	Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--
M	VIRGINIA	And we give the explanation you came up with.
M	FLETCHER	Exactly.
M	FALK	So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple enough.
M	FLETCHER	Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT. The
M	FLETHCER (CONT'D)	Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--
M	FLETCHER	Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.
M	MR. ALLAN	Don't let me interrupt, Fletcher. I just want you to know I'll be observing this a fternoon. Miranda insisted I see you in action. Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.
M	MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)	I'm looking forward to it. Go get 'em!
M	FLETCHER	C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question!
M	FLETCHER	Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat. Here goes...
M	FLETCHER	Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole?
M	FALK	Yes.
M	FLETCHER	Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The "not" was INVOLUNTARY. It takes everyone by surprise.
M	FALK	Excuse me?
M	FLETCHER	If I might rephrase your Honor. Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?
M	X\	Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic? Is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? Mr. Falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? No. I mean, yes. I think.
M	FLETCHER	Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?
M	FALK	What?
M	FLETCHER	How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking? '
F	DANA	Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness!
M	JUDGE STEVENS	It's hig witness!
M	FLETCHER	Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo--
M	YOU?!!	Falk looks shaken as Fletcher barrels on, unable to stop
M	FLETCHER	
M	FALK	No further questions.
F	DANA	Uh...no questions.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Call your next witness.
M	FLETCHER	I have no further witnesses, your Honor. A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	You have no further witnesses?!
M	VIRGINIA	What are you doing? Call me.
M	FLETCHER	I can't.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Mr. Reid?
M	VIRGINIA	Call me, damn it!
M	FLETCHER	You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.
M	VIRG INIA	L is ten , you bastard. I want m y money. I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia
M	FLETCHER	Thirty-one?
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of -- FLETCHER Your Honor, I call Virginia Cole to the stand. Stunned, Virginia nervously makes her way up,
M	MR. ALLAN	What the hell is he doing?
F	MIRANDA	Kissing his career goodbye. The Baliff stands before the witness.
M	BALIFP	Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?
M	VIRGINIA	I do. Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.
M	FLETCHER	Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia?
M	VIRGINIA	Yes.
M	FLETCHER	But that would be a lie, wouldn't it?
M	VIRGINIA	What do you mean?
M	FLETCHER	Isn't your true name... Carlotta?!
M	VIRGINIA	Well, yes. But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that? Not really. It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta? He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,
M	F LETCHER	Your driver's license. What color are your eyes?
M	VIRGINIA	Blue.
M	FLETCHER	Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then? Brown.
M	FLETCHER	And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you? C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.
M	VIRGINIA	Brunette.
M	FLETCH ER	More like a dirty brown, isn't it? Let's see - . - " Weight: one-o- five"? Please...
M	VIRGINIA .	One-eighteen. One-twenty-six. I swear!
M	FLETCHER	So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself? Wrong! I didn't lie to make myself younger. I made myself older. I was born in 1965!" What? You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older?
M	VIRGINIA	Yes! " lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I
M	GOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I-	went-to-law-school'!
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Mr. Reid, does this have a point?
M	FLETCHER	Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR
F	DANA	Prenuptual agreements.
M	FLETCHER	YOU VERY LITTLE! This contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed 路 more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant. Standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars!! Yo . . . . a e . . . . T A T T T ! ! u r OSTT! Nothing further, your Honor!
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Q uie t! Let me see-the license and birth certificate. All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents. Then:
M	JUDGE STEVENS	In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS. FLETCHER'S WON! Dana, Mr. Cole are
M	MR. ALLAN	That son of bitch pulled it off! Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously,
M	JUDGE STEVENS	O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct? FLETCHER AND DANA
M	VIRGINIA	No! I'm contesting custody.
M	FLETCHER	What?
M	VIRGINIA	Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.
M	FLETCHER	He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? .
M	VIRGINIA	No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.
M	FLETCHER	But -- but -- you said he was a good father.
M	JUDGE STEVENS	M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.
M	FLETCHER	No. .
M	JUDGE STEVENS	In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. Court is adj ourned! He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's
M	VIRGINIA	Stop that! We're leaving now!
M	CHILD	I want to go with Daddy. Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away
F	MR. COLE	Don't worry. I'll see you no matter what. I promise. Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.
M	MR. ALLAN	I love kids. They give you so much leverage in a case like this. Congratulations, partner. how does it feel? And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole
M	FLETCHER '	Excuse me. Just a second. Y our Honor? Your Honor? Wait!
M	JUDGE STEVENS	We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.
M	FLETCHER	Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.
M	FLETCHER (CONT'D)	T his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too?
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Mr. Reid, you are out of order! MEN'S ROOM!! Do you ever stop to ask yourself, why do people hate us? Could it be because what we did here today sucks?! We don't care about the truth! We don't want to find the t r u th ! We want to win! We want to win at all costs...and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly i s ? WINNING! Winning and finding out you're left with nothing!
M	JUDGE STEVENS	That's enough, Mr. Reid --
M	FLETCHER	-Let' s see what I' ve done today. I've helped a gold digging slut get richer. I'm taking this guy's kids away. I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners!
M	GREAT 1 I	Fletcher does feel strangely fantastic. Free,
M	JUDGE STEVENS	That's it, Mr..Reid. I find you in contempt!
M	HAIR? --	
M	MOUSSED! SHOULDERS --	
M	LIFTED! TEETH --	
M	JUDGE STEVENS	Bailiff! Remove Mr. Reid from the courtroom!
M	FLETCHER	Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh yeah, let's let it rain... The truth is is that I've traded my life...a beautiful wife, an incredible son for THIS PISS The bailiff grabs Fletcher, forces him out...
M	INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE?!!	
M	HAPPY TO SEE ME??	Fletcher is pushed passed Mr. Allan.
M	MR. ALLAN	You just killed your career. I hope you're happy.
M	PAUL	We're going home.
M	EMMANUEL	Yeah, thanks for the great game, Max. Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from
F	AUDREY	Max, honey. Your dad had a very big case today. It probably just--
M	MAX	I don't want to talk about it.
F	AUDREY	Okay. I hate dad! I hate him!
F	AUDREY	Honey, don^t say that. Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The
F	AUDREY	Max, there's something I-want to talk to you about. . . Pho ne call!! Phone call!! I g et to make a phone call!!
M	MAX	When would we move?
F	AUDREY	Soon. My semester's almost over. You only have a week left of school... You like Jerry don't you? So what do you say, should we check it out? Jerry wants us to come with him tonight. He live and he really wants our help?
M	MAX	Could I get a sled for when it snows?
F	AUDREY	Of course you can. Max thinks, then:
M	MAX	Okay.
M	F L E TC H E R	Answer! Answer!! Answer!! !
F	AUDREY	Hello. . Audrey! It's Fletcher-- I can't talk now, Fletcher. We have to pack.
M	FLETCHER	Wait, the most amazing thing's happened to me! I am feeling so good... Pack?! Did you say pack?!
F	AUDREY	Max was sitting on the porch again, waiting for his dad. I won't let you do this to him anymore. I won't let you do this to me.
M	FLETCHER	A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to you. I .swear, I'm a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a thousand dollars and bail me out... Hello? O ne more call!! I need another call!!
M	FLETCHER	And what about our water su pply ? You don't think "the man's" dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You're damn rightJ "The man" does anything he w an ts. We're nothing but pu ppets... Little game pieces they move back and forth. A DEPUTY appears. '
M	DEPUTY	Mr. Reid. ^
M	FLETCHER	That's me. Fletcher T. Reid. Pawn no. 332-154-9867.
M	DEPUTY	You made bail. Some woman.
M	FLETCHER	Audrey? Greta?!
F	GRETA	Am I too late? Have you been se xu al ly molested yet? I could circle the block.
M	FLETCHER	Greta! Greta!! . . . . Look at you, you well preserved, underpaid, overworked, underappreciated thing you. G iv e me a hug! You came and got me out!! Hug me!!
F	GRETA	Yes, well, I heard you went all noble in front of Mr. Allan so--
M	FLETCHER	Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here..,
F	GRETA	Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc to you?!
M	FLETCHER	Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth. Oh, my God!! I have to go! Thanks again, Greta! By the way, the truth is that I need you and I couldn't file a paperclip without you! Greta smiles, then catches herself, and quickly regains her
M	FLETCHER	Answeransweransweranswer... We HEAR a RECORDED VOICE: The subscriber you called is either unavailable or outside the calling area.
M	FLE TCHER	Shit!!
M	JERRY	A little going away present. I was gonna get you a bowl of clam chowder but they only had Manhattan.
M	A UDREY	Say thank you, Max.
M	MAX	Thanks. 路. Max takes off the hat his dad gave him and replaces it with
M	FLETCHER	Shelton, Jerry Shelton. What time's that flight leave? 7:50. Thank you. Oh, shit! Shit!! Shit! Fletcher spots the FLASHING LIGHTS.
M	FLETCHER	Shiiiiit!!! He pulls over -- so quick he jumps the curb.
M	POLICE OFFICER	Would you step out of the car, please? Fletcher obeys.
M	FLETCHER	Listen; I know I'm driving a little crazy but i have an emergency to attend to... The cop's just getting off his walkie talkie.
M	POLICE OFFICER	I'm impounding this vehicle.
M	FLETCHER	W h y ? What for? For changing lanes?
M	POLICE OFFICER	I just ran your tags through the computer. You've got. seventeen unpaid parking tickets.
M	FLETCHER	No ! I paid them! This morning! That's the truth! I swear!!
M	POLICE OFFICER	Not according to the computer.
M	FLETCHER	The computer is wrong! It ' hasn't been updated. The computer's a liar!
M	POLICE OFFICER	You can straighten it out at the impound yard.
M	FLETCHER	
M	POLICE OFFICER	No?
M	FLETCHER	That's right, no! I'm not gonna lose my son because some stupid clerk was too lazy to update the computer. Now if you want to follow me, . you can follow me and take the car after I get where I'm going. I'm a lawyer and I k now my rights! Understand?! A TOW TRUCK drives away with Fletcher's car, leaving
M	FLE TCHER	T axi! Taxi!! No luck. He spots
M	A PAYPHONE	digs through the Yellow Pages. Finds "Ten Minute Taxi".
M	FLETCHER	Noooo!!! He spots a man walking by.
M	FLETCHER	'Scuse me, sir. Do you have any - - The man turns. It's the same BEGGAR Fletcher was rude to
M	BEGGAR	Change? Absolutely. He continues walking.
M	FLETCHER	Could you spare some?
M	BEGGAR	Unquestionably. The beggar continues on.
M	' FLETCHER	Alright, I get your point. But this is a crisis! Look, I'll give you ten bucks. The beggar pulls out a quarter and holds it up. It's so shiny and new.
M	FLETCHER	Tw ent y. .
M	BEGGAR	Minted in Denver. Imagine that.
M	FLETCHER	Thirty-four. That's all I have. A moment as the beggar thinks, then:
M	BEGGAR	It's worth twice that to screw you. He walks off, grinning. Fletcher turns, spots a familiar building in the distance.
M	FLE TCH ER	M y office!!
M	SECURITY GUARD	Whoa, where do you think you're going?
M	FLETCHER	I just need to use the phone to call a cab. I work here.
M	MR. ALLAN (O.S.)	Used to work here. Mr. Allan has just exited the elevator. Son, that man is tresspassing. The guard starts toward Fletcher threateningly.
M	FLETCHER	Hold it! I've got ten years worth of dirt on you and this firm, and I'm in the kind of mood today to get a lot off my chest. You let me use the phone or I start talking!! Fletcher's is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the street. Mr. Allan
M	MR. ALLAN	Still euphoric, Reid? He goes back inside.路 Fletcher starts to get up when a CAR
M	MAN'S VOICE ( O . S . )	Fletcher! 路 It's PHILIP.
M	PHILIP	Seven-thirty... It's Karaoke time! Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,
M	FLETCHER	You're saving my life, Philip.
M	PHILIP	You know, it's funny, but for some reason I was beginning to think you didn't like me. Isn't that silly?
M	FLETCHER .	No. It's not silly. I don't like you.
M	PHILIP	What?
M	FLETCHER	I don't like you. I'm sorry. I find you boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn't know a good time if it sat on your face. I'm sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really felt. Are you upset? A moment, then:
M	PHILIP	No. To be honest, I don't like you either. You treat people like obstacles and you cheat at charades. .
M	FLETCHER	Then why are you always trying to socialize with me?
M	PHILIP	You're a client. I figured if I didn't try to be your friend, you'd get a new accountant.
M	FLETCHER	Philip, I don't like you as a person, but I'm crazy about you as my accountant. I ' d never hire a new accountant. Never!
M	PHILIP	So we don't have to like each other anymore?
M	FLETCHER -	Not at all.
M	. PHILIP	All right. Sooner I get you 路to the airport, sooner I can dump your sorry ass off.
M	FLETCHER	Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain, something, anything... He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17." Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!! Holy Shit!!
M	FLETCHER	Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...
M	WOMAN	Help the poor?...
M	FLETCHER	I don't trust you. I don't know what the hell that uniform is. Sorry.
M	INSPECTOR	Please step through again.
M	FLETCHER	Ahhh!! ! Damn..; Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex He tries again. It BUZZES again!
M	FLETCHER	What? I'tii practically naked! A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.
M	FLETCHER	It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...
M	FL E TC H ER	N ooo!!! Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT". Goes for it
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Can I help you?
M	FLETCHER	Look out!! ! -- The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And No way he'll catch it. Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER
M	WORKER	Hey!! Hey!!!! But Fletcher's gone. Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane. He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on F LET CH ER
M	STEWARDESS	In case of a water landing, please use your seat cushion 路Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher. Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO ... and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side. Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!
M	FLETCHER'S POV	The RUNWAY is ENDING!.
F	AUDREY	It's right here, honey.
M	M AX	Mom! Mom!! '
F	AUDREY	Just a second, Max.
M	MAX	Mom, it's dad!
M	AU DREY	W hat? What about dad? Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...
F	AUDREY	Fletcher?! And BAM! FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!
M	FLETCHER	Oh boy, the truth hurts. Yes indeed.
M	DEPUTY	Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you. Greta? Is that you? He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY.
M	FLETCHER	Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really. You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . .
F	AUDREY	Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing?
M	FLETC HER	That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin...
M	FLETCHER	Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max. This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher
M	FLETCHER	I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.
F	AUDREY	You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight.
M	FLETCHER	I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry.
M	FLETCHER	I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again?
M	JERRY	I design security systems.
M	FLETCHER	How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec?
M	JERRY	The biggest.
M	FLETCHER	One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds . ..
F	AUDREY	Don't put Jerry in the middle.
M	JERRY	It's okay. Boston means this to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey.
F	AUDREY	All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
F	AUDREY	You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today.
M	FLETCHER	Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,
M	FLETCHER/TERMINATOR	I have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . Argghhh! You mad at me? Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:
M	FLETCHER	You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way... But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more important things. I was so stupid, Max. Malfunction in vector one. All this time you've been here and I could see you anytime I felt like it. And I... didn't. Please don't go to Boston. Max, I love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it weren't true. Not today. A moment as Max studies his father, then:
M	MAX	He's telling the truth, Mom. He's not allowed to lie. I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth. Right? But Fletcher's looking at his watch...
M	FLETCHER	Max. .. it's 9:22.
F	AUDREY	What?
M	FLETCHER	Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. Max steps away from Fletcher.
M	MAX	So then, you were...
