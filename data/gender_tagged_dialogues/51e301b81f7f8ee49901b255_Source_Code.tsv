M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SOURCE CODE	Darkness. A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A He swallows. A strange, creeping panic. He has no idea where he is. Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
M	COLTER	Ma'am? Nothing.
M	COLTER	Excuse me... ma'am? She looks up. Blank stare.
M	COLTER	What is this?
F	CHRISTINA	What's what?
M	COLTER	Where am I?
F	CHRISTINA	Almost at Newark. Goes back to her journal.
M	COLTER	What's Newark? A city?
F	CHRISTINA	It's more of a hell hole. But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea
M	COLTER	Woah. I think I'm going to puke.
F	CHRISTINA	Okay, bathroom's that way. Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.
F	CHRISTINA	Go. Seriously. Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,
M	CONDUCTOR	Ticket? A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
M	CONDUCTOR	May I see your ticket? The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
M	COLTER	I don't think I...
M	CONDUCTOR	Have to write you up then. He pulls out a citation pad.
M	COLTER	Is this...? From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The
M	COLTER	Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it here. Where's this train headed?
M	CONDUCTOR	New York. Penn Station.
M	COLTER	New York? Why would he be going to New York? How can this be
M	COLTER	Do you know where I got on? The conductor examines his ticket again.
M	CONDUCTOR	Princeton Junction.
M	COLTER	Where's that?
M	CONDUCTOR	"Bout ten minutes back.
M	COLTER	But I've never been to Princeton Junction. See... I don't remember waking up or buying a ticket or getting on the train or anything else. It's just a blank.
M	CONDUCTOR	Lucky you. The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his
M	COLTER	Okay. You're gonna figure this out. As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:
M	DEREK	Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut, An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane. A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper. A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister. A SCRAPE. He looks to see A woman FILING HER NAILS. Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He
M	COLTER	Sean Fentress? Who the hell's that? And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to
M	COLTER	Ma'am? She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been
F	CHRISTINA	Why do you keep calling me ma'am? How old do you think I am, anyway?
M	COLTER	I'm having a little problem here. I'm trying not to freak out, but I think something's happened to me.
F	CHRISTINA	Like what?
M	COLTER	Like, total memory loss. Complete. I don't know how I got here.
F	CHRISTINA	So you drank too much last night. So did I. Unfortunately, I remember the whole thing.
M	COLTER	That's not it. See... I'm a pilot. I fly helicopters in Iraq. I'm in the army. She waits for more. As if he's telling a joke.
M	COLTER	I was on a mission. Right before I woke up here I was in the middle of a mission... Wavering. Unsure of himself. His memories.
F	CHRISTINA	Boy, you really did drink a lot last night.
M	COLTER	I'm telling you the truth.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train begins to SLOW DOWN. A few people begin to get up.
M	COLTER	These aren't my clothes. And this wallet here... He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to
M	COLTER	You see this? This isn't me.
F	CHRISTINA	Of course it is.
M	COLTER	What?
F	CHRISTINA	Take a look in the mirror, good sir. The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not
M	COLTER	This can't be happening. The train lurches to a stop.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station. Colter gets up. Through the windows, a few passengers Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	All aboard. Doors are closing. Christina watches Colter go. Curious.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	This is a New York bound train. Next stop, New York - Penn Station. He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on
M	THE MIRROR	Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own.
M	COLTER	Wake up! The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train, This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from. Her hand knocks.
F	CHRISTINA	Hey. You okay in there?
F	CHRISTINA	You left your bag on the seat. Which is a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. I probably saved you a huge fine. No answer.
F	CHRISTINA	I'll just leave it right out here for you. She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the
M	CHRISTINA (O.S.)	If it'll help you remember, you've been riding this train every morning for three months. Her words rouse him. Three months?! He looks UP. An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it Something is sitting up there. From outside comes a TRAIN HORN. Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the
M	A MASSIVE BOMB	It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied
M	COLTER	Jesus. Running footsteps from outside. Commotion. An ALARM sounds. On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an An odd sound, like a BALLOON loosing air or MACHINERY winding BRILLIANT WHITE. All sounds cease. For exactly 1/3 OF A SECOND, a mysterious PATTERN OF LINES Then it's gone. Many will not even see it. Now there is only darkness. Nothingness. Seconds pass.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	This is Beleaguered Castle.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission. The measured calm of a mission controller's voice comes over
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain Stevens, do you copy?
M	COLTER	Where am I? You're with Beleaguered Castle. PULL BACK, fractionally, to reveal Colter in a tight and Are you functional? He tries to clear his head. He's still upside down.
M	COLTER	I'm dizzy.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Adjusting your rotation. Very slowly, almost imperceptibly, Colter's upside-down face Can you report at this time?
M	COLTER	What is this? Who am I talking to? More confusion. No idea how to react. Just as on the train.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Report what you saw.
M	COLTER	When? Just now.
M	COLTER	I was on a train.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	And?
M	COLTER	And... There was a bomb. What the hell is going on?!
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Just relax, Captain. Embedded into the controls is a two inch-square VIDEO
F	GOODWIN	Standby for thread one of alpha memory pattern.
M	COLTER	Who are you?
F	GOODWIN	You already have that information, Captain. Now think. Recall my name. A long moment. A name floats into his head.
M	COLTER	Goodwin?
F	GOODWIN	Correct.
M	COLTER	How do I know that? I have no idea how I know your name's Goodwin.
F	GOODWIN	Commencing memory pattern.
M	COLTER	Listen to me. Something's wrong. I was flying a mission. I was in a chopper. Then I woke up on a train. Now I'm here. Can you explain that? What unit is this?
F	GOODWIN	You're with Beleaguered Castle.
M	COLTER	Who?
F	GOODWIN	You're with friends. The exercises will assist you. Are you ready? Just like with the train, he seems to have no choice but to
F	GOODWIN	Memory Thread One. Listen to the following passage: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver.
M	GOODWIN (CONT'D)	In the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighboring building, she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying on a tawdry heap on a chair." End of thread one. Silence. Is it Colter's turn to speak?
M	COLTER	I don't get it. Is this a Red Flag exercise?
F	GOODWIN	Thread Two. Listen. I am holding the following hand of cards: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. I repeat: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. End of thread two. Beads of sweat on Colter's forehead. What the hell?
F	GOODWIN	Thread Three. The following is a recording of a Western Screech-Owl: A rather spooky BIRD CALL plays -- a short whistle, followed
F	GOODWIN	End of Thread Three. End of pattern. Acknowledge. Unexpectedly, in the back of his mind, a reply is there.
M	COLTER	A... Acknowledge. End of pattern. How did he know to say that? A conditioned response?
F	GOODWIN	Stand by to initiate pattern recall.
M	COLTER	Go for pattern recall. The response comes to him more quickly. Like lines from an The five playing cards. Arrange them in order of descending values, irrespective of suit. He thinks for a moment. Focus. Play along. Maybe it will
M	COLTER	Queen, two nines, four and a three.
F	GOODWIN	That is correct. The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name. What was that name?
M	COLTER	Laurie. No. Lily. Her name was Lily. At each answer, Goodwin makes notations and adjusts gauges.
F	GOODWIN	That is correct. End of pattern. Goodwin leans forward to flip a switch and EVERYTHING GOES
F	GOODWIN	Please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform you've been trained to operate. Colter mulls his options. Should he talk? Keep silent? He
F	GOODWIN	Please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform you've been trained to operate.
M	COLTER	Is someone going to tell me what's going on here?
F	GOODWIN	Please list the primary -- The UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter weighs 20,250 pounds with a maximum exterior load capacity of 8,000 pounds. It has a range of 320 nautical miles and is armed with two 7.62 millimeter machine guns.
F	GOODWIN	That is correct. Who bombed the train?
M	COLTER	The train.
F	GOODWIN	Who bombed the train, Captain?
M	COLTER	I have no idea.
F	GOODWIN	Whom do you suspect bombed the train?
M	COLTER	I don't know!
F	GOODWIN	You didn't see?
M	COLTER	Will you tell me what the hell is going on here?
F	GOODWIN	The Screech-Owl song can be seen as a progression of musical notes. Did the notes go up, down or remain at the same pitch?
M	COLTER	I don't know. Just tell me --
F	GOODWIN	How many times was the bird call repeated?
M	COLTER	train?
F	GOODWIN	How many times was the bird call repeated?
M	COLTER	Twice.
F	GOODWIN	Incorrect. Who bombed the train, Captain?
M	COLTER	I don't know who bombed the train! Colter is seething now. Had it with these games.
F	GOODWIN	You have seventeen minutes. Use them. Find the bomber. ON SCREEN -- Goodwin leans forward to press a button and -- Click. Everything goes dark. We HEAR Colter's nervous
M	COLTER (V.O.)	Hey. What's happening? The HUM of machinery starting up.
M	COLTER (V.O.)	Goddamn it, Goodwin, what is all this? The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a
M	A TRAIN WINDOW	At the passing woodland scenery. He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat. Everything is exactly the same as before. Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern." Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger Is Goodwin watching him from somewhere? Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites. He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his CLOSE ON -- THE TICKET. It hasn't been punched yet.
M	COLTER	It's a goddamn simulation. Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up.
M	COLTER	A three dimensional, completely immersive scenario. Touch, taste, sound, sight and smell. A measure of relief. A way to think about all this.
F	CHRISTINA	Are you talking to me?
M	COLTER	Complete with pretty girl.
F	CHRISTINA	Pretty girl.
M	COLTER	Every combat simulator has one. In the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno. You're an unusual choice for a distraction.
F	CHRISTINA	And you're a moron. Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of
M	COLTER	Find the bomber. Find the bomber. The conductor approaches him.
M	CONDUCTOR	Ticket? Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be
M	COLTER	Everything okay today, chief?
M	CONDUCTOR	Say what?
M	COLTER	Anything out of the ordinary? The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy?
M	CONDUCTOR	Please take a seat, sir. Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray. TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone:
M	DEREK	Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... Then... the CLICK of a LOCK UNLATCHING. The restroom door swings open. GUZMAN, the Middle Eastern Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom. In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks
M	COLTER	How's it going? Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark
M	COLTER	What's your name? Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The
M	CONDUCTOR	Didn't I tell you to take a seat?
M	COLTER	Goodwin? Where are you? It's over. I found him. Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing
M	CONDUCTOR	Who are you talking to? An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just
M	COLTER	Sorry. This guy seemed a little... anxious. I was worried about him. I am minding my business. Tell him to mind his. The conductor has noticed Guzman's white-knuckle uneasiness.
M	CONDUCTOR	You feeling all right, sir? With a pained smile, Guzman loosens his collar.
M	GUZMAN	Motion sickness, I'm afraid. I believe I will get off at the next stop.
M	CONDUCTOR	Very well. The conductor turns back to Colter.
M	COLTER	Okay. I'm sitting down. Turning away, he finds a seat. He studies Guzman out of the

M	COLLEGE STUDENT	Hey, you dropped this.
M	DEREK	Wow. Thanks. The College Student waits to get off. Colter now eyes him As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes
M	GUZMAN	Excuse me... Please let me through... Jesus, he's running away.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station. The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	All aboard. Doors are closing. Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m., The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
M	COLTER	A guy just came through here. Did you see where he went?
M	CLERK	Lots of guys come through here. Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no

Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM." The train to Philadelphia will be four minutes late... The train to Philadelphia will be four minutes late... Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks
M	COLTER	All better now? Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his
M	COLTER	Don't much care for trains myself. The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining. Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors
M	GUZMAN	I resent this. This is harassment. You obviously work for someone. I expected this reception in your country.
M	COLTER	How are you going to pull this off? That bomb has a cell phone detonator. And I don't see a pay phone around here. So I'm betting you got a phone on you with the number already programmed in.
M	GUZMAN	I have no idea what you're talking about. I am an international business man. An executive. The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
M	COLTER	Open your briefcase. Prove to me there's no phone in there. I will prove nothing to you. Leave me alone. WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The "Hasnan Guzman, Vice President, Shell Oil." Must be a cover.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Philadelphia train now approaching. Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.
M	COLTER	Where the hell's your phone? Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
M	COLTER	I thought so. Now let's see you try to -- A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,
M	THE EXPRESS TRAIN	Closing in on the station. The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
M	COLTER	You didn't do it. Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO Everything stops. Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than This time they all connect into

F	GOODWIN	Do you need to urinate?
M	COLTER	A fucking train just ran over me. Do you need to urinate?
M	COLTER	How are you doing this? Am I on some kind of drug?
F	GOODWIN	Did you find the bomber?
M	COLTER	I didn't find the bomber. You fooled me with the Middle Eastern guy. I went for the diversion. What kind of freaky simulation is this? Let me out of here!
F	GOODWIN	Which Middle Eastern guy? Be specific.
M	COLTER	Guzman. Shell Oil. Look, I don't have intel experience. Why do you have me doing this?
F	GOODWIN	You've already been told what you need to know. Discipline your memory. Limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you. Everything else is irrelevant.
M	COLTER	Irrelevant? Killing me each time is irrelevant?
F	GOODWIN	You do not die. As you can see, you simply return to us.
M	COLTER	How? How can you do that? Silence.
M	COLTER	Who's the man with the pipe?
F	GOODWIN	Say again?
M	COLTER	There was a man smoking a pipe. I saw him on the monitor. Who's he? How does he fit into this?
F	GOODWIN	The man with the pipe isn't here right now.
M	COLTER	Let me talk to him. This isn't right. I'm not your prisoner. Goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges.
F	GOODWIN	You feel unsatisfied with our relationship?
M	COLTER	What is this? Why are you talking like that? Is this some kind of script?
F	GOODWIN	If Guzman, the Middle Eastern man, is innocent, as you maintain, who might be the guilty party?
M	COLTER	Who cares? I'm tired of this.
F	GOODWIN	This isn't a game, Captain.
M	COLTER	Then what is it? Don't you already know who the bomber is? Don't you have all the answers?
F	GOODWIN	We have no answers. Only corpses. A weird beat.
M	COLTER	Corpses? Whose corpses? The passengers?
F	GOODWIN	Some were too badly burned to be identified.
M	GOODWIN (CONT'D)	The heat from the explosion fused many of them completely into the wreckage. Is this the truth? Or another evasive answer? His mind
M	COLTER	These were real people?
F	GOODWIN	Yes.
M	COLTER	This really happened?
F	GOODWIN	Yes.
M	COLTER	When?
F	GOODWIN	Today.
M	COLTER	Today?! The train blew up today?
F	GOODWIN	It was attacked this morning, at 7:57 a.m., Eastern Standard Time. Six miles outside of New York City. Colter's head is spinning.
M	COLTER	You're lying. I don't believe it.
F	GOODWIN	What do your senses tell you? His senses tell him it's true. But how can he accept it?
M	COLTER	Where am I, right now, as we speak?
F	GOODWIN	With Beleaguered Castle.
M	COLTER	My unit's still in Iraq. I'm flying missions in Iraq. I flew one yesterday!
F	GOODWIN	Your unit was rotated Stateside three weeks ago. The news comes like a slap in the face. Colter clearly has
M	COLTER	Then why do I still have Iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails? Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls.
M	COLTER	Talk to me! Three weeks? I've been back three weeks? How'd I get in here? Have I seen my family? Does my father know I'm home? "Cause I'd kinda like to tell him if that's the case.
F	GOODWIN	Listen up, soldier. Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk. As
F	GOODWIN	The train is just the beginning. Our intel says there are more attacks are coming today. And they're linked with the train. Time is of the essence. Do you understand? Colter barely hears. He's fixated on that shoulder patch.
F	GOODWIN	Captain?
M	COLTER	I'm listening.
F	GOODWIN	D.N.I. Counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow-up targets in the New York area.
M	GOODWIN (CONT'D)	They are, in no order of importance, the Holland Tunnel, Newark International Airport, the Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and the Empire State Building. It could be any of them, it could be none of them. Whatever it is, if you find the bomber and learn his plan, the next one we might be in a position to prevent. Those are your orders. It's too much information to process. Colter's head spins
M	COLTER	Wait. If I'm somehow on that train before it blows up, why don't I just dismantle the bomb?
F	GOODWIN	Those are not your orders.
M	COLTER	But all those people dying...
F	GOODWIN	Those are not your orders. You are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission. Military priorities. Defying comprehension.
M	COLTER	I didn't volunteer for this shit.
F	GOODWIN	Would you like to see the release form you signed? How do I know it's real? How do I know you didn't force me to sign it? And how the hell can I be put on a train over and over again -- a train I never was really on?! He might as well be talking to a wall.
M	COLTER	I don't believe in time travel, Goodwin. There's no such thing. Machinery begins to RUN. Like the WHINE of a JET ENGINE
F	GOODWIN	Only one way forward, Captain. Seventeen minutes. Find the truth.
M	COLTER	Why seventeen? Why me? Why anything? The capsule begins to SHAKE.
M	COLTER	Let me out! Don't send me back there! SFX: UP ON a HUGE ROAR as --
M	COLTER	Shit. This is not happening. He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down
F	CHRISTINA	Ain't life grand? Across from him, Christina sketching. A gentle smirk. He
M	COLTER	You an artist?
F	CHRISTINA	I went to art school. Doesn't make me an artist.
M	COLTER	Can I see what you're working on? Her pencil pauses. She eyes Colter.
F	CHRISTINA	I'd rather not. He looks down at his watch. 7:41 a.m. He's been back for
M	COLTER	You don't look like you belong here. The way you're dressed.
F	CHRISTINA	You certainly do.
M	COLTER	I'd really like to see what you're working on. Unless you're worried I won't like it.
F	CHRISTINA	It's private. And your opinion doesn't interest me.
M	COLTER	So you scribble away on that thing so as not to deal with people. She scowls. Tosses the sketch pad onto his lap. Surprised,
M	COLTER	They're amazing.
F	CHRISTINA	I wouldn't go that far.
M	COLTER	Seriously, they're really good, Miss...?
F	CHRISTINA	Christina.
M	COLTER	My name's Colter. How many of these passengers have you drawn?
F	CHRISTINA	All of them, practically. She leans forward, eyes glinting conspiratorially.
F	CHRISTINA	I know all about them.
M	COLTER	You know all about them?
F	CHRISTINA	I'm a collector of moments. That woman over there? She's a patent attorney with three kids and a summer place on Long Island. More important, however, she colors her hair herself and wears the same houndstooth check suit every third Wednesday. The nebbishy fellow behind her always calls into his office three minutes before we go into the tunnel. And the guy with the shaved head and leather jacket eating a scone has a profile identical to that of Julius Caesar. A click of the restroom door opening. Guzman emerges from What about that guy? Christina looks over Guzman.
F	CHRISTINA	I haven't seen him before today. He's cranky. Thinks the worst of people.
M	COLTER	Dangerous?
F	CHRISTINA	Everyone's dangerous.
M	COLTER	You see anything unusual happen this morning? Anything out of the ordinary?
F	CHRISTINA	I'm not sure I know what you mean.
M	COLTER	Has anyone else come out of that bathroom that you remember? She takes a closer look at him. A puzzled smile.
F	CHRISTINA	Who are you? Colter hesitates. Debating.
M	COLTER	Don't you know? Haven't you seen me here every day for, what, three months?
F	CHRISTINA	Something's different about you today.
M	COLTER	If I told you that there's a terrorist on this train, that I was sent here to catch him, would you believe me?
F	CHRISTINA	Most fervently.
M	COLTER	Then tell me which one you'd arrest. Christina pages through her sketch pad again. Considering
F	CHRISTINA	They're all so utterly normal. That's what's terrifying about them. Perhaps there's more than one. A team at work. The patent attorney in cahoots with Julius Caesar and the nebbishy guy. And don't forget the sullen college kid. He's the expendable one. But they're all controlled by this good- looking stock broker. She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker.
F	CHRISTINA	Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. The perfect Machiavellian operative. Out for himself. He'll betray them all in the end. She's not taking him seriously.
M	COLTER	Never mind. He gets up. Foolish of him to confide in her. His watch now
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train begins to slow. Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the He's getting away...! Colter moves aside to let them walk past. Thanks for your help, ma'am.
F	CHRISTINA	Ma'am? How old do you think I am?
M	COLTER	I don't know. Thirty two? Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Next stop New York Penn Station. Back down to the mirror. Sean Fentress's face. The most
M	COLTER	What happened, Fentress? Who are you? How can I be you? FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought.
M	COLTER	"CAOC-N." What unit is that? A KNOCK on the door. Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there.
F	CHRISTINA	Who were you talking to?
M	COLTER	Leave me alone. Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows
F	CHRISTINA	My pleasure, okay? It's just that you left your bag on your seat. It's a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. Maybe you're the terrorist. This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid.
M	COLTER	Terrorist? Why did you say that?
F	CHRISTINA	I was joking.
M	COLTER	Stop joking. Who are you? Are you an operative?
F	CHRISTINA	I had no idea you were so thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely sure I like it.
M	COLTER	Why do you have sketches of everybody on board? Are you part of this?
F	CHRISTINA	Part of what?
M	COLTER	I can have you arrested. Maybe that's the only way you'll drop the bullshit and talk. Stay put. I'm getting help. She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness. Speaks

F	CHRISTINA	Six months ago I moved back in with my parents because I ran out of money. I got A's in line drawing and advanced oil painting but no one's buying my stuff. Two weeks ago I put away all my paints. My little sketch book is the last thing left. You see, I'm not a artist. I'm a receptionist in a law firm. The only thing I operate is a phone switchboard. The stark reality of her life. The HORN of the FREIGHT TRAIN yanks his attention to the
F	CHRISTINA	Now let me tell you about you. You work at the New York Public Library. You've been eyeing me for months on this train but haven't said a word to me. You're bland and colorless and predictable. And now I see you're delusional, too. Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window.
M	COLTER'S POV	Above the row houses, a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER is climbing
M	COLTER	Son of a bitch. "CAOC-N." That's not army. That's Air Force. Combined Air and Space Operations Center. Nellis Air Force Base!
F	CHRISTINA	Are you mocking me?
M	COLTER	They're running this whole thing out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Fucking Nevada! Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this
M	COLTER	What's there? What's on that base? B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat Command. Predator Drones. Remote operations. This a remote operation. What if it is time travel? A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his
M	COLTER	What did he say? A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around
F	CHRISTINA	Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to me again. She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away.
M	COLTER	Christina! He grabs her -- she struggles against him --
F	CHRISTINA	Get off me! But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and Like a star exploding. A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss. A woman. It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-

M	COLTER	Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen. The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.
M	COLTER	Goodwin! It's now COMPLETELY DARK. He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump. The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.

M	COLTER	Come on! Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke. But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT. FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	-- four principle dialects of Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian- Lebanese and North African. We will now play you portions of each, discussing the audible differences between them. CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play. Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
M	COLTER	Hello? Anyone out there? It's me. He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up. It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
M	COLTER	Can you hear me? Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
M	RUTLEDGE	Project designer initiating sequence and drives check.
M	COLTER	I'm here! I'm okay! Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.
M	RUTLEDGE	Is someone there?
M	COLTER	Yeah. It's me. Colter. Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.
M	RUTLEDGE	Wow! It's you.
M	COLTER	The capsule lost power. It's still pretty cold in here.
M	RUTLEDGE	We've been working towards you from the other side. Nice to have you with us again. You feeling all right?
M	COLTER	I think so. Who are you?
M	RUTLEDGE	The name's Rutledge.
M	COLTER	They wouldn't let me talk to you before.
M	RUTLEDGE	No, I guess not. They're pretty anal around here. Don't tell them you saw me smoking in here, okay? His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
M	COLTER	You're the inventor of this thing. I prefer the term project designer. And sorry for all the secrecy. Goodwin will be thrilled you re- established contact.
M	COLTER	I don't want to deal with Goodwin anymore.
M	RUTLEDGE	What?
M	COLTER	Don't you understand? He's torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't you get me out of here? Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
M	RUTLEDGE	Why would Goodwin have it in for you?
M	COLTER	He's a remote operator. And remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field.
M	RUTLEDGE	He seems pretty devoted to the mission.
M	COLTER	And just what kind of mission is this? Talk to me, man. Why won't he let me save those people on the train?
M	RUTLEDGE	Because they can't be saved.
M	COLTER	Why not? I know what's going to happen. I could take apart the bomb. Stop the train.
M	RUTLEDGE	Yeah but you'd be doing it in the Source Code, not here. Not in our own past. Mystery upon mystery.
M	COLTER	What's the difference?
M	RUTLEDGE	I'm not sure I should be telling you this.
M	COLTER	Telling me what? Coaxing the scientist in him.
M	RUTLEDGE	It's quantum physics. Linear algebra. Parabolic calculus. It would take weeks to explain.
M	COLTER	Is Source Code time travel? Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.
M	RUTLEDGE	It's gone out again.
M	COLTER	Why can't I save those people on the train?
M	RUTLEDGE	Think of it like this: events in our past can never be undone. Einstein proved that.
M	COLTER	So...
M	RUTLEDGE	So Source Code opens up another past for you. A parallel past. It looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world. In essence, by sending you back, an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created. It looks identical to ours, but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality. At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.
M	COLTER	What happens to the Source Code world after I leave it?
M	RUTLEDGE	I don't know. You can never know that because you're not there to observe it. Maybe it vanishes. Maybe not. I should tell them you're okay.
M	COLTER	What about the bicycle?
M	RUTLEDGE	What bicycle?
M	COLTER	I see it each time. Right after the bomb goes off. Like an after image.
M	COLTER (CONT'D)	There's a bicycle and a stone wall and a girl. It's a girl from the train. I don't know where any of it is supposed to be, but -- Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth.
M	RUTLEDGE	Wait. You see all this after you leave the train?
M	COLTER	Yeah. Just for a split second. Rutledge is stunned. Like he's discovered some strange new
M	RUTLEDGE	Please tell me you're not making this up.
M	COLTER	No. It's there. What do you think it means?
M	RUTLEDGE	I don't know. Rutledge looks off camera for a moment.
M	RUTLEDGE	They're here. There's no more time to talk. Make sure he sends you back in. Find out about the after images.
M	COLTER	Rutledge, wait. Don't leave me. Rutledge steps away. A pointed look at Colter. Goodwin
F	GOODWIN	Welcome back. How are you feeling?
M	COLTER	I'm alive. No thanks to you.
F	GOODWIN	You find the bomber?
M	COLTER	You're a brick wall, Goodwin. A fucking brick wall.
F	GOODWIN	Lower your pulse. The situation has worsened. The fire on the tracks caused one of the freight cars to blow up and release some kind of gas. As a precaution they're having to evacuate all of lower Manhattan. Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this. Having to
F	GOODWIN	We may have lost the initiative.
M	COLTER	What do you mean? Let's keep going.
F	GOODWIN	We were expecting more from you.
M	COLTER	I can give you more. Let me think for a second. But Goodwin ignores him. Absorbed in paperwork.
M	COLTER	The freight car blows up from the fire. It spews gas, or what could be gas -- it might be chlorine, so they can't take any chances. Anxious now. Trying to make up lost ground. Whatever it
M	COLTER	So they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of New York City. And maybe that's part of the terrorists' plan, right? So... so who benefits from that? What's vulnerable? What's down there in lower Manhattan? Wall Street. Surprising himself with this insight. And now Goodwin is paying attention again. Waiting for more.
M	COLTER	Wall Street. That's what they're going to hit next. The financial markets. Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly
F	GOODWIN	I want to show you something.
M	DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOS	The video monitor shows CHRISTINA's DMV shot. Her wry,
M	COLTER	Did she die, too?
F	GOODWIN	Yes. This drivers license photo was found with her body. We're creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site. A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts.
M	COLTER	You sure she's dead?
F	GOODWIN	Would you like to see her morgue photos? She was sitting across from me.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	We know. Playing a GRAINY, HAND-HELD VIDEO of the TRAIN WRECKAGE.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	This was taken shortly after the rescue crews arrived on scene. The TIME CODE on the image reads 8:26 a.m.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	We noted the location of each corpse when we pulled it out. On screen, rescue workers pull a CHARRED CORPSE out of the
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Prepare yourself. This is unedited footage.
M	COLTER	I told you I didn't want to see her! The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a
M	COLTER	That's...
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Sean Fentress. The man in the mirror. Himself, at least on the train.
M	COLTER	He died on the train.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	As a host identity, Sean Fentress had to have certain basic similarities to you. Gender. Blood type. Approximate age. His head was still intact. We need the head, you see. To link the two of you remotely. They carry the corpse towards a MORGUE TRUCK with a vast The image freezes, then DISSOLVES back to Christina's DMV Silence. Pondering.
F	GOODWIN	Would you like to see the other passenger photos? Perhaps that would help you.
M	COLTER	You still have Christina's body? The other things she was carrying?
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Why?
M	COLTER	I want to know about her. Everything I can. She's not just another victim. She's connected to all this. If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it. CLOSE ON - HIS WATCH - A beep as he sets it to countdown
M	COLTER	Thirty six dollars and eleven cents. She looks up at him.
M	COLTER	In your wallet. Right now. Thirty six dollars and eleven cents.
F	CHRISTINA	Is this a magic trick or something?
M	COLTER	Yes. In five seconds, a guy's going to open a can of soda. The Overweight Man opens his soda can. She gives Colter a
M	COLTER	We're about to pass a street with willow trees. Two girls will be jumping rope. A white dog's going to run out behind them. A Dalmatian mix. In a moment, they pass a scene exactly as Colter described.
F	CHRISTINA	You want to tell me how you're doing this?
M	COLTER	Close observation. You could say I'm a collector of moments.
F	CHRISTINA	A collector of moments?
M	COLTER	Yes.
F	CHRISTINA	That's the cheesiest line I've ever heard. She resumes her drawing.
M	COLTER	You trained to be an artist. No response.
M	COLTER	You got A's in line drawing and oil painting. But your work didn't sell. You took a job answering phones in a law firm.
M	COLTER (CONT'D)	Six months ago you moved back in with your parents. Two weeks ago you put your paints away for good. The sketch book is all you have left.
F	CHRISTINA	Who the hell are you? Who have you been talking to?
M	COLTER	You.
F	CHRISTINA	Me? No. I haven't ever talked to you.
M	COLTER	But we have, Christina. You've drawn all these people here. You know their routines. At one point you thought you were different from all of them. But now you're not so sure. Christina has gone white. Utterly incredulous.
F	CHRISTINA	Okay, you've got my attention. Now tell me what this is all about.
M	COLTER	I need your help.
F	CHRISTINA	Are you selling something?
M	COLTER	Listen to me. I can't use up any more time trying to convince you. I just need you to believe everything I'm about to tell you.
F	CHRISTINA	This better be good.
M	COLTER	Bear with me. Your sketch book. Is there a drawing of me in there?
F	CHRISTINA	I'm not sure.
M	COLTER	Please, Christina.
F	CHRISTINA	Yes, fine! Here. She flips through it. Shows him a sketch of SEAN FENTRESS.
F	CHRISTINA	I did it last week.
M	COLTER	The thing is, that's not me.
F	CHRISTINA	Give me a little credit.
M	COLTER	No. You drew what you saw, but the person you're seeing now is someone else. I'm not Sean Fentress. I'm not really on this train. You're not really on this train.
M	COLTER	I'm taking someone's place. Borrowing it. My name is Colter. I'm a soldier. And I'm being held prisoner. And this is the only way -- the only time and place I have -- to figure out how to escape. She gives him a blank look.
F	CHRISTINA	After three months of riding the train, this is how you introduce yourself to me?
M	COLTER	I'm serious. Elements in the American military are using me for an experiment. I'm not sure exactly how it all happened, but I'm at a facility on Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Right now. As we speak. It's a project called Source Code.
F	CHRISTINA	Source Code.
M	COLTER	It's a program. It shifts identities. It also performs small amounts of time travel. Or "time engineering." I don't know the jargon. He's not getting through to her. It's too bizarre.
M	COLTER	I've been put on this train to look for someone. A criminal. And I need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train. Because right here's only place I can figure out what's really happening. But I have very little time. And each time I come back, you won't remember me and I'll have to go through this all over again.
F	CHRISTINA	You are, I think, deliciously mad.
M	COLTER	Then how do I know all those things about you if we've never spoken before? She doesn't have an answer. Can't easily dismiss him.
F	CHRISTINA	Why tell all this to me? There's lots of people around for you to talk to.
M	COLTER	Because I think you have the answer to this whole thing.
F	CHRISTINA	Believe me, I don't have the answer for anything.
M	COLTER	There's a vision. I keep having it. It's very powerful. And you're in it. And there's a bicycle. And this... old stone wall. And it's very peaceful. Does this sound familiar? Like where you live, maybe?
F	CHRISTINA	Stone walls? My parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an American eagle over the door. The only bike is a Harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning.
M	COLTER	The vision must mean something. It's the only time when I'm not on the train or in the capsule. Why else would Rutledge be so interested?
F	CHRISTINA	Who's Rutledge?
M	COLTER	Someone who was trying to help me understand something. Until they got to him. He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. Colter looks at HIS WATCH. Ten minutes left.
F	CHRISTINA	I saw a program on TV. It was about psychics. They say psychics have a lot of paranoia.
M	COLTER	I don't believe in that shit.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station. Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	All aboard. Doors are closing.
F	CHRISTINA	Don't you have people you can go to for help? Friends, family? The train begins to move again.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	This is a New York bound train. Next stop, New York - Penn Station.
M	COLTER	Most of my friends are in the military. My dad runs a melon farm in Alabama.
F	CHRISTINA	Maybe now's the time to reach out to him. She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his
M	COLTER	Me and my dad, we don't see eye to eye. We're just two different people.
F	CHRISTINA	As opposed to being the exact same person?
M	COLTER	Are you always this sarcastic?
F	CHRISTINA	This is so not about me. Colter reluctantly dials. As it rings --
M	COLTER	What day is it?
F	CHRISTINA	
M	COLTER	June? One more thing to puzzle him. The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers.
M	DONALD (V.O.)	Hello?
M	COLTER	Dad? Donald doesn't respond.
M	COLTER	Dad, it's me. It's Colter. Again, silence.
M	COLTER	Been a while, huh? I'd been meaning to call you, but -- Click. The line goes dead. Colter looks at Christina.
M	COLTER	He wanted me to stay on and take over the farm but... I had other ideas.
F	CHRISTINA	You're intimidated by him.
M	COLTER	What?
F	CHRISTINA	You're scared of him. I can see it.
M	COLTER	The hell I am. Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call
M	COLTER	Dad, don't hang up. We're going to talk. I need your help. Now you listen to me. Whoever you are, never call here again. Donald hangs up.
F	CHRISTINA	He's still mad at you, huh?
M	COLTER	No... it was like he didn't even know who I was. Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS
F	CHRISTINA	I don't know how to help you. She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes.
M	COLTER	Sorry to have bothered you. He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is.
M	CHRISTINA (V.O.)	I have a friend. Surprised, he turns to find her there.
F	CHRISTINA	She works at the New York Times. Her name's Stephanie. She's just a proofreader, but she wants to be made a reporter. She's always saying she needs a good story to bring in so she gets noticed. Something like this, with a crazy paranoid angle could really interest her.
M	COLTER	Forget it.
F	CHRISTINA	She could do some poking around. She's already quite suspicious of the government. Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the
F	CHRISTINA	I'm getting voice mail. Steph, it's Christina. You know that story you're always looking to write? I might just have something for you. I met a guy. His name is Colter Stevens. He says he's in the army. He flies helicopters in Iraq, but now they've put him into a secret project called Source Code. Maybe you can look into it a bit, okay? Call me. She hangs up. Pleased with herself.
F	CHRISTINA	She'll call back. Just wait. None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.
M	COLTER	Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am? How old do you think I am? He gives her a wary look. Considers.
M	COLTER	Twenty five? She smiles, pleased.
F	CHRISTINA	No, but thanks. What did you mean, there's a criminal on the train? How do you know that? Colter looks away. Careful.
M	COLTER	I just do.
F	CHRISTINA	How can I help you if you don't tell me everything about this?
M	COLTER	You said you wanted to know.
F	CHRISTINA	Can't you just tell me? He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in
F	CHRISTINA	Try anything and I'll kill you.
M	COLTER	Shut the door. As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.
F	CHRISTINA	What are you doing? He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.
M	COLTER	It's up here. He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the
F	CHRISTINA	What are you --
M	COLTER	Just look. Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat
F	CHRISTINA	Is that...?
M	COLTER	Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid explosive. There's fourteen cannisters of it. Simple detonator. Cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom. He lowers her. An incredulous beat.
F	CHRISTINA	Did you put this here?
M	COLTER	No. It was someone else. They don't know who. That's why I'm here. To find out. Watching her. Will she believe him?
F	CHRISTINA	We have to tell someone. We have to stop this.
M	COLTER	It won't matter. The train's already...
F	CHRISTINA	Already what?
M	COLTER	I've been sent here. It sounds crazy, but it's true. I've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future. This train's already been blown up. She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be.
M	COLTER	You wanted to know. Now you know. She turns and hurries for the exit doors.
F	CHRISTINA	This isn't happening. I've got to get off. Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's
F	CHRISTINA	Why won't it open?! Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the
F	CHRISTINA	It's Steph. I told you she'd be interested. Hi. Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens. It's awful. Unbearable. He dashes towards the bathroom --
M	THE BOMB	Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the Colter...? Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips
M	CHRISTINA (O.S.)	Colter, I have to tell you something. -- and pulls off the detonator cell phone. Ducking back
M	COLTER	Look. Now the fucking thing can't go off.
M	HIS WATCH	Reads 20 SECONDS.
F	CHRISTINA	Stephanie did a computer search. Something in her expression worries him.
F	CHRISTINA	She's got a database of all newspaper articles going back to forever.
M	COLTER	Source Code's classified. It wouldn't be in a newspaper.
F	CHRISTINA	No. But you were. She found you.
M	COLTER	She found me? What does that mean? She stops. Not wanting to go on. From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight
M	COLTER	Jesus Christ, Christina, are you going to spit it out? In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in
F	CHRISTINA	According to the notice, you were killed in action two months ago. The world stops. A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him. He drops the phone and Everything around him PIXELATES into a hundred thousand
M	SOLDIER (O.S.)	Never any damn leg room on a plane. An ALARM begins beeping.
M	FLIGHT MEDIC (O.S.)	Hey, this guy's crashing...
M	FADE TO BLACK.	Silence and darkness. Nothingness. Then, a PLAYING CARD appears, as if through a slide
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain...? The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Goodwin. You're with Beleaguered Castle. You are safe. All your needs will be met here. Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain? The sound drives away the image, replacing it with
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain, just tell me what you see. Just look and speak. Groggy breathing. A ragged voice:
M	COLTER (V.O.)	I see a card.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Very good. Very, very good. On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the
F	GOODWIN	Are you comfortable? Are you warm? Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing Do you need to urinate? Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak.
F	GOODWIN	Beleaguered Castle is waiting for your report. Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips
M	COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)	Hearing Test. First sequence. Left ear. A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES.
M	COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)	Hearing Test. First sequence. Right ear. The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert.
F	GOODWIN	Captain, I know you can hear me. Did you find the bomber? Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting.
M	COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)	Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver." Goodwin stops the audio.
F	GOODWIN	As you're collecting your thoughts, I should tell you there's been another development. A terrorist group has taken responsibility for bombing the train. This began broadcasting over the Internet a half hour. We've traced it to central Asia.
M	ON THE MONITOR	A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far- The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade
M	MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER	By now you have suffered a taste of divine vengeance. God willing, you will soon suffer another. Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even
M	MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER	These attacks will show you that you will never be safe. You can secure your borders. But what can you do against one of your own citizens? One who looks like you, who is blameless, living already among you, who takes eighty million of our dollars, a trifle, and carries out our bidding? You cannot stop this. Time has run out. The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of
M	COLTER	Let me talk to Rutledge.
F	GOODWIN	So you've decided to speak.
M	COLTER	Rutledge. Get him.
F	GOODWIN	We appreciate your desire for further discussion. Perhaps at a later date.
M	COLTER	Will you let me out of here? Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations.
F	GOODWIN	Frankly, Captain, we're disappointed.
M	COLTER	Find Rutledge! Now!
F	GOODWIN	I have to say that we expected more from you.
M	COLTER	Stop! Stop reading from your goddamn script!
F	GOODWIN	Perhaps we overestimated your abilities.
M	COLTER	I swear to fucking Christ!
F	GOODWIN	Please accept the criticism in the spirit it was given. Perhaps a few memory exercises would help.
M	COLTER	I don't need your criticism and I don't need your memory exercises, you gutless freak. And by the way, that bomb is detonated by a cell phone. When activated, the phone's display screen displays caller ID information. Caller ID. I wonder if that information would be useful to Beleaguered Castle. For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of
F	GOODWIN	Very well. We're ready for that information.
M	COLTER	You'll have to send me back. I didn't get a good look at it. But I will next time. Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical.
F	GOODWIN	What assurance do we have you'll be able to read the screen before the device detonates?
M	COLTER	Goodwin, there's no time left. Send... me... back. Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in
M	COLTER	Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone. Behind him, the
M	COMPUTER ENGINEER	Hey, do you have my phone? People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just Dude, give me back my phone! THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL Looking over at him in surprise.
M	COLTER	Sorry. Wrong turn. Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment. Operator. City and listing.
M	COLTER	Las Vegas, Nevada. Nellis Air Force Base. Connecting you. A tingle up his spine. The call connects.
M	POST OPERATOR (V.O.)	Post Operator.
M	COLTER	Is this... Nellis Air Force Base?
M	POST OPERATOR (V.O.)	Yes, sir. How may I direct your call? He takes a deep breath.
M	COLTER	I'm trying to reach... Captain Colter Stevens. Calling himself. Strange. No idea where this is going.
M	POST OPERATOR (V.O.)	I have no listing for a Captain Colter Stevens.
M	COLTER	Then give me the Combined Air and Space Ops Center.
M	POST OPERATOR (V.O.)	One moment, sir. The call seems to take forever to connect. Then a terse
M	VOICE (V.O.)	C Deck.
M	COLTER	Who is this? C Deck.
M	COLTER	I'm calling for Rutledge. It's urgent.
M	VOICE (V.O.)	You have the wrong number.
M	COLTER	This is Captain Colter Stevens. An eerie pause. Would you repeat that?
M	COLTER	Colter Stevens. Captain Colter Stevens.
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Hold the line.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train slows at it pulls into Newark Station.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Captain? This is Goodwin. Colter's heart sinks.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Where are you, Captain?
M	COLTER	Let me talk to Rutledge.
F	GOODWIN	Where are you? How did you find us?
M	COLTER	I'm on the train. The train pulls to a stop.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station. What train? You don't know. It hasn't happened yet.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	What hasn't happened?
M	COLTER	The explosion. What explosion?
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	All aboard. Doors are closing.
M	COLTER	Don't you understand? I'm in it, Goodwin. I'm calling you from inside the mission. Inside the Source Code. A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Next stop New York Penn Station. This contact is ill-advised. I must ask you to hang up.
M	COLTER	Goodwin, I'm trapped in this and I can't get out. You have no authorization to be making this call. Goodbye.
M	COLTER	No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget authorization. There's no time. Soon you're going to find out what happened on this train. And then your own day is going to start. But not until then. Right now it's just you and me talking. And you're a different Goodwin than the one I'm going to go back to in a few minutes. You're separate from him. Separate worlds. Do you understand? I think so.
M	COLTER	Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy in all of this, and you have your reasons for that. But here and now, just this once, I need to ask you something. And you need to tell me the truth.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	I'd rather you not ask me anything, Captain.
M	COLTER	I'm going to ask it.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	I should terminate this call.
M	COLTER	Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get through to you? You're not just a soldier. Somewhere inside you're a human being, too. Somewhere inside you've got to know that this is wrong. Source Code is wrong. And if you can't grasp that, if you just follow orders, then you're just as much a prisoner as I am. The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	What's your question? Surprised, Colter raises his head. Draws a breath.
M	COLTER	Did I survive that helicopter crash in Iraq? Silence. Colter shuts his eyes.
M	COLTER	Answer me. Did I survive that crash? Another pause. This is crushing Colter.
M	COLTER	Goodwin.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Not physically.
M	COLTER	What?
F	GOODWIN	You did not physically survive the crash. A terrible chill comes over Colter. He swallows. Trying to
M	COLTER	Not physically? Fuck. At least give me an answer I can understand.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	We've kept alive certain areas of your brain.
M	COLTER	But... the capsule I'm in...
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	A manifestation. Your way of making sense of it. This is crushing. Colter fights back terror.
M	COLTER	You had no right. As a soldier...
M	COLTER	I was a soldier. Then. But now? After death? It was the only way. You couldn't have a body and be sent back into the Source Code. What is the status of your mission? Is it a success?
M	COLTER	You really want to know? I suppose not. You're right to keep it from me.
M	COLTER	That's what we do. Keep stuff from each other. Will this ever end?
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	End?
M	COLTER	How can I get out of this?
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	You must realizes the army's made an investment in you. You'll be used again.
M	COLTER	How?
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Imagine a turntable. With a record spinning on it. All we do is lift up the needle. The music stops.
M	COLTER	And then what? Then we wait. Until another mission. And the needle comes down again. You won't remember any of this. We'll start with the playing cards. Electronic tones. Simple memory exercises. Bit by bit, we'll revive your cerebral capacities once more. The barbarism of it. Digital slavery.
M	COLTER	How many times have I done this?
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	Does it matter?
M	COLTER	No one knows I'm here. No one can help me.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	In stimulating your cortex, they're prolonging your life. Many soldiers would find that preferable to death.
M	COLTER	You can't do this. I served my country. I already gave my life. The courts.
M	COLTER	What?
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	The courts know you're here.
M	COLTER	Military court or civilian court? Military. Colter finds no comfort in this.
M	GOODWIN (V.O.)	I'm sorry you found out about all of this. That wasn't our intention.
M	COLTER	Does that make it any less wrong? No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running
M	COLTER'S FACE	Ashen. Almost lifeless. Around him is the darkened steel The monitor is blank. He shouts from the void --
M	COLTER	Goodwin?! Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the
M	RUTLEDGE	How's it going? Any breakthroughs?
M	COLTER	I finally get it, Rutledge. You're the good guy, Goodwin's the bad guy. Working together, you get what you want out of me. Why didn't I see it before?
M	RUTLEDGE	Believe me, Captain, I'm on your side.
M	COLTER	Drop it. I know about the helicopter crash. I know what they've done with me. Look, it's been a long day. For all of us. But now we've got to bring this home and catch a killer.
M	COLTER	What's in it for me?
M	RUTLEDGE	Come on. These guys are serious. Help me out. My ass is on the line, too, you know.
M	COLTER	You can do better than that. They sent you here to offer me a deal.
M	RUTLEDGE	If you think I'm enjoying this, you're wrong.
M	COLTER	What's their offer? What can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally fucking me? Spit it out, you spineless turd. Rutledge's face goes red. Quite possibly no one has ever
M	RUTLEDGE	The government can decide to take an interest in people. People like your father with his struggling farm. It can discover things like unpaid property taxes. It can call in his equipment loans or tie him down for years in environmental litigation. On the other hand, it can pay him handsomely for mineral deposits he never knew were there. As distant and problematic as your relationship was, surely you'd like the chance to do something for him. A beat of silent outrage from Colter.
M	COLTER	Those after images I saw. You never knew about them. They weren't part of Source Code architecture, were they? They're meaningless. Nerves firing. Brain chemistry.
M	COLTER	You don't believe that. I've been to places you haven't. I've crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying. And when I do, that veil gets lifted for just a second. And what's there is real. Maybe it's a vision of the next world, but I can see it.
M	RUTLEDGE	You can see it. But you can never get there without our help. Get there? What do you mean?
M	RUTLEDGE	Our offer. Maybe we can get you there. In return for your completing the mission. They'll let you die. I'll shut off your life support and you'll simply slip away. Just like the good Lord intended you to do a few months back. A fearful beat. Negotiating over his own soul.
M	COLTER	You'd never do it. You wouldn't have to. You could just flip the switch and start me back up again unaware. For all I know, you've made this deal with me before.
M	RUTLEDGE	Actually, we haven't. Your operational awareness has become too great. If you found out the truth about yourself once, you might do so again. As for Source Code, I'm sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours. Do you have the courage to serve your country one final time? Colter's eyes bore into Rutledge.
M	COLTER	I'm going to find you, Rutledge. Someday. Somewhere.
M	RUTLEDGE	The display screen on the detonator was a useful and exciting insight you made. This time, make it pay off. Get the information on the screen. But let the bomb explode. We need the force of the explosion to help integrate you quickly back into the present. The Source Code machinery is already beginning to HUM.
M	COLTER	You hear me? Somehow, I'm going to find you.
M	RUTLEDGE	I doubt that. There's barely time for Colter to grab onto the harness
M	THUNK.	Colter's body convulses and goes limp. Unconscious, he sags
M	AND GOES DARK.	A split second later, the capsule comes back to life again.
M	RUTLEDGE	Captain? Colter JOLTS AWAKE. Disoriented. Thrashing to get free.
M	RUTLEDGE	It's okay. Calm yourself. You're back. Colter exhales. Shuddering. He's just completed another
M	RUTLEDGE	What happened? The tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing. Replaced by
M	RUTLEDGE	Was the bomber's identity on the cell phone?
M	COLTER	I think so. But there wasn't time to read the screen. As soon as it rang the bomb went off. What about the phone itself? Make, model, product identification number.
M	COLTER	I was unable examine the phone without separating it from the detonator -- which I was instructed not to do. His delivery is different now. Impersonal. Distant.
M	RUTLEDGE	Did you make any other progress? What in heck's name did you do for those seventeen minutes? Colter does not answer. The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered.
M	COLTER	Wait. What are you --
M	THUNK.	Again, he convulses and goes limp. Click. Darkness. Everything POWERS DOWN...
M	RUTLEDGE	We can do this all day. Until you get it right.
M	COLTER	Please... I don't feel good...
M	RUTLEDGE	I don't doubt it. Who's the bomber?
M	COLTER	I don't know... I honestly... I can't keep... The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin.
F	CHRISTINA	Hey! Colter, back in his navy jacket, slacks and shirt, has
F	CHRISTINA	You want to get off me? The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger
M	COLTER	Go ahead! Open your fucking soda! CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered
F	CHRISTINA	What's wrong with you, anyway? She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond. From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment
M	EXIT AREA	Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him
F	CHRISTINA	You okay? He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen
F	CHRISTINA	You're not okay. He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely.
M	COLTER	Ma'am, please... return to your seat. Footsteps. The sound of jangling KEYS.
M	CONDUCTOR	Ticket. The conductor takes up position in front of him. As
M	CONDUCTOR	Ticket, please.
F	CHRISTINA	He's not feeling well.
M	CONDUCTOR	He still needs a ticket. Colter makes no move to respond. No more concern for
M	CONDUCTOR	Have it your way, pal. He takes out his book to write Colter up.
F	CHRISTINA	Wait. I'll pay it.
M	CONDUCTOR	I have no idea where he got on. Full fare's $22.50.
F	CHRISTINA	All right, all right. Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor. He eyes her
F	CHRISTINA	I see customer service is alive and well on New Jersey Transit.
M	COLTER	Why did you just do that?
F	CHRISTINA	The ticket? I don't know. You looked a little lost. The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious. She
M	COLTER	Will you do me a favor?
F	CHRISTINA	What's that?
M	COLTER	Get off the train.
F	CHRISTINA	What?
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop.
M	COLTER	Please. Just get off the train. Her puzzled look. The train begins to SLOW DOWN.
F	CHRISTINA	This isn't my stop.
M	COLTER	You shouldn't have been on this train, Christina. You should be living another life. Not spending it answering phones for lawyers.
F	CHRISTINA	How do you...? A group of passengers approaches the exit area. We've seen
M	COLLEGE STUDENT	Hey, you dropped this.
M	DEREK	Wow. Thanks. The train stops. The doors OPEN.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station. Derek, the Old Man and the College Kid get off. A second Leaving just Colter and Christina there. The doors stand
M	COLTER	Everyone has a destiny. And this isn't yours. He steps out onto the platform. Holds out his hand for her She's incredulous. This guy. His words. This whole moment.
F	CHRISTINA	Who in the world are you?
M	COLTER	Just do it. Stop being afraid. Believe in yourself. He waits for her. Only two steps away.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	All aboard. Doors are closing. She blinks. The spell breaks. Those two steps prove to be
F	CHRISTINA	Leave me alone. She retreats back into the car. Colter is heartbroken.
M	DEREK	Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek And then it happens. With a quick motion Derek TOSSES SOMETHING through an open With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	This is a New York bound train. Next stop New York - Penn Station. Intrigued, Colter leaves the exit door area...
M	EXIT DOORS	There's nothing there. Whatever Derek tossed inside is gone. And there something lies. Colter slides it out.
M	RUTLEDGE	They've searched the wreckage and found the wallet. It was under the wall panel. Just as you said. An awkward dynamic between them. They despise each other but
M	COLTER	Believe me, he's our guy. He tossed his own wallet back on the train. Only reason he'd do that...
M	RUTLEDGE	...is if he wanted us to think he died in the explosion. I know. We looked into his profile.
M	RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)	Derek Frost is a commodities trader, with a wife, two children and a promotion one month old. He's an emergency preparedness volunteer on his office floor, for God's sake.
M	COLTER	You saw that terrorist video -- they said it was one of us. One of our own.
M	RUTLEDGE	If he's really the one, you can find out the rest of his plan.
M	COLTER	How?
M	RUTLEDGE	By any means necessary. There is no Geneva Convention in the Source Code.
M	COLTER	Torture him, you mean. Find out the plan, before it happens here. And then I'll let you die. Their grisly bargain.
M	RUTLEDGE	In the conductor's compartment there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter handgun locked in a safe. Think you can remember the combination?
M	GUZMAN	Excuse me.
M	COLTER	Assalam'alaikoom. Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	What listing?
M	COLTER	The New York Times.
F	CHRISTINA	Hello?
M	STEPHANIE (V.O.)	Christina? It's Stephanie. Where are you right now?
F	CHRISTINA	Going to work. Why?
M	STEPHANIE (V.O.)	The strangest thing. The phone rang at my desk and some guy I don't know said the train you're on isn't safe and that you should get off at the next stop. Then he hung up.
F	CHRISTINA	What? The train begins to SLOW DOWN. Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop.
F	CHRISTINA	I don't understand. Maybe you should get off. Are you okay? The station platform slides into view.
F	CHRISTINA	I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is there something on the news? Some kind of alert?
M	STEPHANIE (V.O.)	Nothing that I've heard.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station.
M	STEPHANIE (V.O.)	I think you should get off.
F	CHRISTINA	I'll be late for work.
M	STEPHANIE (V.O.)	The hell with work, Christina! You hate that job anyway.
F	CHRISTINA	It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy from somewhere. She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	All aboard. Doors are closing. Once again he's failed to save her. They watch each other for as long as possible, until the Did you get off...?
F	CHRISTINA	No. I'll call you back. She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	This is a New York bound train. Next stop New York - Penn Station.
M	CONDUCTOR	Huh? The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED.
M	COLTER (O.S.)	Derek Frost. Colter is walking towards him, holding up Derek's WALLET.
M	COLTER	You forget something?
M	DEREK	Gosh. Is that my wallet? As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM. BANG - The men's room DOOR flies open -- Colter DRAGS Derek
M	DEREK	What the hell, man? What the hell???
M	COLTER	You see this? Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took
M	COLTER	Now you can't blow it up.
M	DEREK	What is this? Get away from me! The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him.
M	COLTER	Believe me, I'm very accurate with one of these things.
M	DEREK	Jesus. Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy?
M	COLTER	Stay there, my man.
M	DEREK	Don't hurt me.
M	COLTER	Stop acting, for Chrissakes.
M	DEREK	Keep my wallet. Take my watch. Take anything you want. Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on
M	GUZMAN	There. Now you have two wallets. Take them and go.
M	COLTER	Shut up! Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this.
M	DEREK	Please. I have a family.
M	COLTER	What about those other passengers? Don't you think they had families?
M	GUZMAN	Just what is this about?
M	COLTER	This man's a terrorist. He planted a bomb on the train. What? Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the
M	COLTER	What's the next attack? Who else are you going to kill today, huh? Oh God... Oh God... Guzman takes a step towards Colter.
M	COLTER	One more step, asshole.
M	GUZMAN	Don't treat him like this. He's not an animal. Neither are you.
M	DEREK	Listen to him. For God's sake I'm not a terrorist...! A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down,
M	COLTER	Piss all you want. You took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today.
M	DEREK	Eighty million dollars? I swear to you...
M	COLTER	Then what about the wallet, huh? Why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board?
M	COLTER	Time's up! What is it?! What is the next attack! So help me, I'll put this bullet through your brain.
M	DEREK	I don't know what you're talking about!
M	COLTER	I'm going to do it. Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are
M	DEREK	I would never hurt anyone. I have a family. I guess you'll have to kill me. But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun.
M	GUZMAN	You see? You are a human being. Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels
M	GUZMAN	This can be worked out. We can listen to each other. The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him.
M	DEREK	Anything you want... Please... The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them.
M	COLTER	Hello. Who is this? Christina? Are you the guy who was sitting across me on the train? Colter looks at his watch. The countdown passes THREE
M	COLTER	How can you be calling this number? My friend had it. From when you called her -- to try and get me off the train. Who are you? What do you want? Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in
M	COLTER	I was trying to warn you.
M	CHRISTINA (V.O.)	About what?
M	COLTER	I'm not sure that it matters now.
M	CHRISTINA (V.O.)	Talk to me. I feel that something terrible's going to happen. Do I need to get off the train? Am I going to die? He can hear the b.g. noise of the train on the other end.
M	COLTER	I'm right here, okay? Don't be afraid. Why didn't I get off the train? I knew I should have driven in today. But then there's the bridges, right? You never know when they'll be jammed. That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind.
M	COLTER	What did you say?
F	CHRISTINA	The bridges. You just never know when they'll be jammed. His heart starts racing.
M	FLASHBACK	On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell
M	DEREK	Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed...
M	BACK TO SCENE	Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks.
M	COLTER	"By one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed." That's what you said. You knew. You knew there was going to be an evacuation. You knew before it happened. All those people walking across the... The realization hits.
M	COLTER	They're going to bomb the bridges. While they're full of people.
M	ON DEREK	A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a What are you talking about. Who's going to -- Over the phone comes the HORN from the passing FREIGHT TRAIN.
M	COLTER	Christina? Just hang in there. You'll be okay. A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek
M	SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD.	Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A
M	CHRISTINA (V.O.)	What's happening? Are you okay? Are you there? Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in: We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She Rutledge talks on a wall phone. Like a team player serving Yes... We appreciate that... I just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges... Thank you, sir. When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other
M	RUTLEDGE	Whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence. And that virtually assures all of our futures. This is just the beginning, guys. You did a great job, Goodwin. You operated our captain with skill and professionalism. What's that you have? Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION.
F	GOODWIN	The Army investigated Colter's helicopter crash in Iraq. Apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel.
M	RUTLEDGE	What's this, then? Some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying?
F	GOODWIN	No. It's the Silver Star. Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's
M	RUTLEDGE	Send it on to his father. It'll ease the pain of his son's death.
F	GOODWIN	I thought I might inform the captain of the citation.
M	RUTLEDGE	Better not. We can't risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isn't entirely clean.
F	GOODWIN	The memory wipe?
M	TECHNICIAN	I thought we were going to let him die.
M	RUTLEDGE	I know, I know. But now the Director of National Intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program, and until we train up another candidate, we'll need to keep Colter around to demonstrate it.
M	TECHNICIAN	Oh.
M	RUTLEDGE	This thing is much bigger than any one of us. Goodwin, please clear Colter's memories and re-initialize Source Code. Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the
F	GOODWIN	Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission.
M	RUTLEDGE	Thank you, sir... I appreciate your faith in me... It's a great day for our country.
F	GOODWIN	How are you feeling? Are you comfortable?
M	COLTER	Just do it.
F	GOODWIN	Come again?
M	COLTER	Just do it. I knew they wouldn't let me die. At least you can make me forget all of this. I hope. Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving.
M	COLTER	What are you waiting for? You're just doing your job. I'd do the same thing if I was you. At least you've got a shot at saving those people on the bridges.
F	GOODWIN	I doubt it.
M	COLTER	You don't think they'll save them?
F	GOODWIN	No. I meant, I doubt you'd be doing this, if you were me. An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin.
M	COLTER	Look, someone had to be where you're sitting, and someone had to be in here. Turned out it was you and me. Just do it. I'm tired.
F	GOODWIN	Would you like to see Christina again? One last time? Colter's not sure he heard him right.
M	COLTER	I don't understand.
F	GOODWIN	Seventeen minutes. That's all I could give you. No mission to fulfill. Just... the two of you. Why would you do that?
F	GOODWIN	As a favor. One prisoner to another.
M	COLTER	Prisoner?
F	GOODWIN	You were right. About me. And about Source Code. We've kept too much from each other. An odd sensation comes over Colter.
F	GOODWIN	I usually report in at 0600. Today I was there early. I was there when the call came in. Your call. His call? They share a long look.
M	COLTER	No... There's no way... There's no way you could have... Goodwin just smiles. How? The Source Code was a parallel world! You told me so! It's hermetically sealed. Nothing I did on that train would have any effect on this reality!
F	GOODWIN	You were on the train. I was not.
M	COLTER	But...
F	GOODWIN	We didn't know if any bleed- throughs could occur. The implications would be staggering. That's why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events.
M	COLTER	You're saying I could have saved those people?!
F	GOODWIN	No. Not in our world. The time currents are too strong. But minor alterations, here and there, a phone call, say, those might slip through. We didn't know for sure. But you proved it. Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.
F	GOODWIN	I've been thinking about the things you said on that call. As the day passed, the more I understood them. And now, I guess we've caught up to each other.
M	COLTER	Man. Just when I think I understand this... There's not much time. They think I'm re-initializing the system. One last look at her. That's all I can give you. If that.
M	COLTER	They'll nail your ass for this.
F	GOODWIN	If I had any feelings, I'd worry about that. But, as you've maintained, I do not. The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at
M	COLTER	Roger that.
F	GOODWIN	This is Beleaguered Castle signing off. Acknowledge final transmission.
M	COLTER	Final transmission acknowledged. Thank you, Goodwin. Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter.
M	INTERCOM (V.O.)	Dr. Rutledge, extension 16. Blinking out of reverie, he goes over to a wall phone and
M	RUTLEDGE	This is Rutledge. He listens. His face darkens.
M	RUTLEDGE	Shit. He SLAMS down the phone and starts RUNNING. For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this The best sight of all.
M	RUTLEDGE	What is this? Who authorized this?
M	TECHNICIAN	We don't know, sir. But Source Code is up and running again.
M	RUTLEDGE	Where's Goodwin? The chair at the console is EMPTY.
M	TECHNICIAN	No idea, sir. A DIGITAL CLOCK ticks down from 17 minutes: 15:28... 15:27...
M	RUTLEDGE	What the hell is he doing? As soon as he's gone, Christina looks up. She's observed his 9-1-1. What is the nature of your emergency?
M	RUTLEDGE	Shut it down.
M	TECHNICIAN	Sir?
M	RUTLEDGE	Shut down the Source Code. Right now. The technician hesitates. Fine. I'll do it myself. Rutledge sits down at the controls.
M	TECHNICIAN	I wouldn't do that. Rutledge gives a dismissive snort. And yet he pauses.
M	RUTLEDGE	And why not?
M	TECHNICIAN	We've never interrupted Source Code in mid run. We'd have to literally pull the plug. It could damage the processors.
M	RUTLEDGE	Let it finish, then. No harm in that, I guess. All of you are in deep shit, I promise you. As for Goodwin, he'll never make it off this base. Rutledge picks up a phone.
M	TECHNICIAN	I don't think that's where he's headed. Rutledge considers. And then catches on.
M	RUTLEDGE	He wouldn't. Looks up at the technician. Grows more and more uneasy.
M	THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK	Which reads: 12:42. Before it hits 12:41, Rutledge is
M	RUTLEDGE	Seal the ICU. I want a detachment of MPs meeting me on the way there.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The Computer Engineer begins to wake up. As he does, Colter The College Kid, also getting up, notices Derek's wallet,
M	COLLEGE STUDENT	Hey, you dropped this.
M	DEREK	Wow. Thanks. Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet. The station slides into view. No one on the platform.
M	RUTLEDGE	What?! He tries again. Red. The door stays LOCKED. Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform,
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Newark Station. Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching.
M	THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS	In station lobby are POLICE OFFICERS. Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS. Derek Frost. Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however,
M	POLICE COMMANDER	Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us. An entire PHALANX OF POLICE OFFICERS is on the platform.
M	DEREK	Of course. What's this about? Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE
M	POLICE COMMANDER	Place your hands in the air.
M	DEREK	My pleasure. Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone. On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Once again, please return to your seats, ladies and gentlemen. No way. No one's moving from the windows.
M	RUTLEDGE	I want to know who reprogrammed this lock. And if you don't get this open in ten seconds I'll see that you're busted back down to private.
M	LOCKSMITH	I'm already a private, sir.
M	RUTLEDGE	Just open it! A man's life is at stake. The key pad goes GREEN and the pressure lock releases.
M	MEDIC #1	Sorry, I can't let you pass. Goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the
F	GOODWIN	Step aside. That's an order.
M	MEDIC #1	We all know your rank, Goodwin, but I have explicit orders from Rutledge not to -- BAM! Goodwin drops the Medic with a splintering HEADBUTT.
F	GOODWIN	I'm glad you know my rank. Were you also aware I'm in the Special Forces?
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Ladies and gentlemen, rail service has been cancelled. Please clear the platform and proceed into the station. New Jersey Transit apologizes for the inconvenience.
M	DETECTIVE	So you have no idea how your cell phone was used to call in the tip?
M	COMPUTER ENGINEER	No! People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and
F	CHRISTINA	What now? How do we get to work? You guys have some busses or something? The transit employee ignores her and walks away.
F	CHRISTINA	Hey! I'm talking to you! She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been
M	COLTER	Ain't life grand? Looking over, she notices him.
F	CHRISTINA	Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for being late.
M	COLTER	Maybe that's a good thing. She gives him a sharp look.
M	RUTLEDGE	Shoot him if you have to, you hear me? The MPs exchange a look of annoyance at being ordered around
F	GOODWIN	Hello, Captain. As Goodwin edges forward, we reveal the bare foot of someone A DIGITAL TIMER reads 1 MINUTE.
M	LOCKSMITH	Give me twenty seconds.
M	RUTLEDGE	Make it ten. Rutledge looks at HIS WATCH. It reads 52 SECONDS. It also reads 52 seconds. His work is done. He's saved her. Saved them all. At least Only she doesn't know that. Christina stands there, arms
F	CHRISTINA	Could this day get any worse?
M	COLTER	That train was taking you to a place you didn't want to be. But then you got off. And maybe that's a sign.
F	CHRISTINA	Yeah. If only. She takes out her cell phone. The stress of her day.
F	CHRISTINA	I'm calling a cab. Maybe I'll only be somewhat late for work. Colter watches her, a quiet ache inside. Maybe some people As he does, we glimpse a horrifying sight: the upper half of
F	GOODWIN	Thank you for your service. Time to go home. Goodwin's hand goes to the switch to shut off life support.
M	COLTER	Hey. She turns. Colter gets up.
M	COLTER	You can do anything you want with your life. Starting right now. She's taken aback. He starts walking off.
M	CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)	Metro Cab Dispatch. A long beat as she watches him. Hello...? Click. She shuts her phone. Beat. Is she crazy? She's baffled by her own action. And
F	CHRISTINA	Wait. Colter turns. She crosses her arms archly.
F	CHRISTINA	You can't just expect someone to change her life just like that. At the very least... you'd have to buy that person coffee and explain your reasons. She waits for his response. Uneasy at putting herself out Colter's watch ticks down to the final seconds. His last
M	COLTER	Maybe some other time. Disappointment flickers on her face. She turns to go.
M	RUTLEDGE	Arrest him! Goodwin backs away from the gurney, hands in the air.
M	RUTLEDGE	He's dying...! Rutledge frantically goes to reconnect the machines -- but
M	RUTLEDGE	Get a medical team in here! Move! But the MPs just stare at the appalling sight of Colter's What are you standing there for?! Do it! We can save him!!! No one moves. Rutledge rashly grabs for one of the MP's
M	RUTLEDGE	I guess force is the only thing you people understa --
M	MP	Back away, sir, now! The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back, Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at
M	RUTLEDGE	You're a murderer. Goodwin offers his hands to the MP.
F	GOODWIN	Go ahead and arrest me. But the MP does nothing.
F	GOODWIN	I'll be around. Whenever you want me. They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
F	CHRISTINA	You okay? Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
M	COLTER	You're right. The least I can do is buy you coffee. This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.
F	CHRISTINA	Okay, well, come on then. Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear A beautiful morning.
