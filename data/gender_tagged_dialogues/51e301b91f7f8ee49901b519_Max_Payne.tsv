M	MAX'S VOICE	C I don't believe in heaven, but I have this idea about it. Something I heard in a song.
M	MAX'S VOICE	Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.
M	MAX'S VOICE	There's an army of bodies under this river. Criminals, people who ran out of time, out of friends.
M	MAX'S VOICE	The next time they drag this river, they'll find me on the bottom with the rest of them. And there won't be anybody left to say I was different.
M	MAX'S VOICE	I could feel the dead down there, just below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me as one of their own.
M	MAX'S VOICE	It was an easy mistake to make.
M	MAN #1	Hey, that's a really nice watch.
M	MAN #1	Kinda reminds me of one I lost--
M	MAX	You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on 128th a few hours ago.
M	MAX	Ask Doug. He was there with you.
M	DOUG	You've been following us all night?
M	MAX	No. I'm only following you.
M	PAWNSHOP	You a cop, or something?
M	MAX	Not tonight.
M	PAWNSHOP	Too bad. Go get my watch.
M	DOUG	Watch over me, watch over me...
M	MAX	Open your eyes, now.
M	MAX	Have you ever seen her before?
M	MAX	You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey with William Preston three--
M	DOUG	Bill's dead.
M	MAX	That's why I'm talking to you. Did he ever say anything about this woman? Did you ever hear anyone--
M	DOUG	Bill died because their wings couldn't lift him up.
M	MAX	No, he got shot robbing a liquor store. What are you talking about?
M	DOUG	Their wings are golden, the feathers only look black... Frozen, the Kid can only squint into the headlights closing NT. COLD CASE OFFICE - DAY
M	SGT. ADAMS	You my new guy?
M	DETECTIVE	I didn't think anybody was here.
M	SGT. ADAMS	Everybody's usually a little late.
M	SGT. ADAMS	All the cold investigations in the city are collected and delivered over to us. We call each witness to see if they can add anything to their original statement.
M	DETECTIVE	And if they can?
M	SGT. ADAMS	We send the file back to the original precinct for follow-up. Don't get your hopes up, though.
M	SGT. ADAMS	Once you've gone through the file and come up empty, bring it here... Max here handles our filing. Once it hits his desk, a case is officially dead.

M	ETECTIVE	What if there's no phone number for a witness? Should I follow up in person?
M	SGT. ADAMS	Nope, we don't do that down here.
M	DETECTIVE	I don't understand, then how--
M	SGT. ADAMS	How do you solve that unsolvable murder mystery and redeem yourself?
M	DETECTIVE	The grand jury couldn't find--
M	SGT. ADAMS	Stop. Trust me, there's a tragic story behind why I'm here giving you this tour. We all did something, so just save it. Follow me to the break room...
M	DETECTIVE	We should get a beer after work, or something...

M	OICE (O.S.)	You can't come here anymore.
M	MAX	William Preston was a dead end.
M	TREVOR	You can't come here, I said. I'm done helping you. I've already... ...paid my debt to society, you know? I've cooperated enough.
M	MAX	We need to talk. Won't take long.
M	TREVOR	I thought you found Bill's partner.
M	MAX	I did, but Doug only wanted to talk about pigeons, or something. I need a new name, someone robbing houses to feed a habit around that same time. T REVOR Three years is a lifetime for guys like that. One way or the other, they're probably all gone now. Either way, I'm not the one to ask anymore. I cater to a better class, now.
M	MAX	I can see that.
M	TREVOR	This is a party. These are my friends. You remember friends?
M	AX	I need another name, or I start frisking your friends.
M	TREVOR	don't have one to give you, Max. Look, you've gone through all your living leads, now you're running out of dead ones... I don't think this guy's out there.
M	TREVOR	ry sleeping at night every now and then, you'd see that for yourself.

M	N	ATASHA Fine. What was her name?
M	MAX	Who?
F	NATASHA	The girl from the boring story you want tell me. The one that ends with you living here. Very sad.
F	NATASHA	tell you what... Call me by her name.
M	MAX	What?
F	NATASHA	That way you can make love to her again, just like she never left you. Oh, Max, I miss you... Like a switch, Max's face closes off again.

M	LEX	What do we know?
M	DETECTIVE #1	Only that it didn't happen here. Beyond that, I don't even know how to describe it in my report. `Disassembled,' that's the word we came up with.

M	ALEX	We found it here, by her heart.
M	ALEX	As far as we know, the victim--
M	MAX	Natasha.

M	MAX	Alex.
M	BB	he first unit to respond must've scared them away before they could do the same thing to you. Pretty remarkable, considering your luck.
M	MAX	He was trying to tell me something.
M	B	Was he alive when you showed up? Did you get a look at the guys who--
M	MAX	No. I get Bflashes, but it's...wrong. I hate to say it, but you need to come up with something better than that. They've got nothing for leads, so the whole force has you pegged as the prime suspect.
M	AX	You tell them where to find me.
M	BB	No need. The funeral starts in an hour.
M	BB	ust slow down. You need to--
M	AX	What I need is to borrow some dress blues. Can you help me out?

M	MAX	It's a bullet hole.

M	MAX	No, I didn't. We met through a friend.
M	BRAVURA	Trevor Duncan. He's your friend?
M	MAX	I guess.
M	BRAVURA	That's classy. You know what Trevor does for a living, I assume?
M	MAX	He used to snitch for me.
M	BRAVURA	T ell me, Max, what's a glorified file clerk still need a snitch for?
M	BRAVURA	see. So you'd piss in a cup for us, right?
M	BB	I think you just said the magic words. Call once you hear from the union lawyer. ou and Detective Hillman haven't worked together since your reassignment. What made you get back in touch?

M	MAX	That's what I'm going to do.
M	BRAVURA	ook at this from my perspective: I've got two bodies in ten body bags. You M were the last person to see either one...

M	MAX	What if I wanted this tattoo?
M	TATTOO ARTIST	Then you're probably in the Marine Corps.
M	MAX	This one.
F	MONA	What is it?
M	TATTOO ARTIST	It's a Norse superstition. The Vikings used to wear them for protection.

M	TATTOO ARTIST	Not angels. Valkyries. T he Artist goes to a shelf bulging with old books - his
M	TATTOO ARTIST	In Norse mythology, the only way you get to go to heaven is to die in violence. Die in your sleep, you go to hell. Valkyries fly over the battlefields, picking out the righteous dead. They reward the people who draw first blood. A soldier's angel.
M	TATTOO ARTIST	I'm generally thrilled to have referral business, but I tell people looking for those wings to find ink closer to home.

F	MONA	Crystal meth, maybe, some amphetamine that raises your body temperature in an overdose. Explains why they were both sweating like that, trying to cool off. Of course, a junky won't usually jump out the window if there's someone left in the room to beg or rob.

Your old man knew if I was going to listen to reason, it B could only happen in here.

M	BB	Any guy who throws himself out a window, I wouldn't pay any attention to the things he said.
M	MAX	The problem is, I knew what he was talking about.
M	MAX	I haven't been really afraid of anything since...that night.
M	BB	And you are now?
M	MAX	There's something going on, and I can't find a rational explanation for it. There's...something out there, hurting people--
M	BB	Okay, calm down.
M	MAX	It's real. I'm not crazy.
M	BB	Then stop acting like it. Max, you're breaking into offices, I.A. is all over you, you won't even show up for work...
M	MAX	The night Alex died, there was something else in the room with us. I saw it.
M	B	B goes a bit pale, smile fading as Max's words continue.
M	B	It's really important that you be careful how you talk to people about this, okay? You're already under suspicion--
M	MAX	It's the same thing these people are seeing right before they die. I think Michelle saw it, too.
M	BB	For God's sake, don't drag her into this.
M	BB	What's really going on here?
M	MAX	Alex found something out about what happened to her. Something new.
M	B	There's no way. He would have told us.
M	MAX	He was trying, right before he died...
M	BB	Listen, okay? Why don't you come back with me, let Beth make up the guest room for you. Just for tonight.

M	VINNIE	Okay. So talk.
F	MONA	Something was taken from me. It involves a club in Italian territory, so I need your blessing to go make it right. V
M	INNIE	You're asking my permission? Well in that case, sweetheart... Mona looks Vinnie over, bored to death by the whole thing.
F	MONA	I said `blessing.'
M	VINNIE	Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra. Which club are we talking about?
F	MONA	Ragna Rok.
M	MONA (CONT'D)	Over on Avenue--
M	VINNIE	Yeah, I know. Sure, fine. You have my permission...blessing, whatever.
F	MONA	You do still control that block, right? It's south of--
M	VINNIE	The guy's name is Jack Lupino.
F	MONA	Well, that sounds Italian to me.
M	VINNIE	He's no kind of Italian I've ever seen. Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we hear.
M	ONA	You're afraid of tattoos, now?
M	VINNIE	When the club first opened, I sent somebody down to collect the...you know, fire insurance. A day goes by, and I don't see him. Then I get two boxes delivered to me. One box's got my guy's hands and ears in it. The other box has a quarter of a million dollars in cash. This neighborhood has been your family's forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes to--
M	VINNIE	What got my attention, Mona, was that the boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy in uniform hands them to me in broad daylight. I'm not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or mouthy Russian bitches. But whoever's watching over Lupino, whoever it is you really need to bless you walking inside Ragna Rok...him, I am scared of.

M	BRAVURA	Believe him about what?
M	BRAVURA	Are you saying you think Max did have something to do with Alex's murder?
M	BB	Absolutely not. Alex was his partner, they were like brothers...he couldn't have. There's no way.
M	BRAVURA	Then what are we talking about?
M	BB	Look, Max is like a son to me. Don't put me in a position to have to hang him. But you should hear the kinds of things he's saying...hallucinations, none of it makes any sense to me.

M	MAX	It's all in her notes: people describing fevers, hallucinations...their lymph nodes swell until their necks bruise like something's been choking them. The angels they all talk about?

M	BB	Jason Colvin. He used to be the head of the pharmaceutical division, but he's moved up over the last few years. I guess Michelle probably reported directly to him...

M	MAX	Michelle Payne was my wife. What color there was to begin with drains out of Colvin.
M	COLVIN	What--
M	MAX	Before you say anything else, I want you to know who I am.
M	COLVIN	Please, wait...
M	BRAVURA	I need to talk to somebody about a woman who used to work here.
M	COLVIN	Please don't hit me again. AX A week ago, I thought the universe had turned against me. Everything I loved was gone, and for some reason I'd been left here to suffer alone.
M	MAX	ut it wasn't the universe that took my family away from me.
M	MAX	It was you.
M	MAX	Tell me about Valhalla.
M	COLVIN	There is no--
M	MAX	Tell me.
M	COLVIN	There's no Project Valhalla anymore. I shut it down years ago.
M	COLVIN	It was a disaster. The drug was so addictive, the damage it did to the mind was so devastating that we lost our government funding. By the end, we couldn't even guarantee the safety of our scientists administering the experiment. Test subjects would follow them home and kill them for an extra dose. M AX Is that what happened to Michelle?
M	COLVIN	Nobody knows what happened to her. Max brings the wires closer to Colvin's wet skin.
M	OLVIN	People thought Michelle might be a whistle-blower. That she wasn't loyal enough to Aesir, and she might go public about the program.
M	GUARD	Authorized personnel only.
M	BRAVURA	Don't look at him. Move aside. I 'm authorized.
M	COLVIN	Why are you asking me about this?
M	MAX	I already told you. Be quiet, now.
M	COLVIN	But why today? It's over, I got rid of everything before they moved me out of the division--
M	F	
M	MAX	Then you haven't been Downtown lately, because you missed a spot.
M	COLVIN	Are you telling me that there are people out there taking the drug again? How many of them?
M	COLVIN	I knew it, I knew something was going on. I told her the numbers were too good--
M	VOICE (O.C.)	Mr. Colvin, are you okay in there? Security's on its way...
M	COLVIN	They're not coming for you.
M	MAX	What are you talking about?
M	C	OLVIN You only know my name because somebody high up decided to cut me loose. There's a safe in the wall. It's open.
M	COLVIN	Show that to whoever will watch. If this thing spreads, nothing will keep the rest of you safe.
M	COLVIN	Wait, I'm not ready...
M	MAX	Back up, all of you. Make a path.
M	MAX	Stay back, or I'll--
M	T	he crowd goes crazy, SCREAMING and trampling each other...
M	BRAVURA	This is Jim Bravura, IA. You need to tell the units responding to the Aesir call to come equipped for automatic-- The Aesir building, nobody's called anything in yet? Hell yes, I'd like to report something. We've got machine gun fire in Midtown. ax gets a few careful SHOTS off from his new elevation,
M	BRAVURA	Put your hands up!
M	BRAVURA	You need to come in now, before anything else gets pinned on you.
M	MAX	She was trying to stop it.
M	BRAVURA	Stop what? Tell me what's happening--
M	W	hile Max scrambles for cover, Bravura charges forward,
M	BRAVURA	NYPD! Hold your fire!
M	BRAVURA	Hold your fire!
M	M	AX You need to see this. From the beginning of time, great generals have all wrestled with one undeniable truth - morale wins battles.
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Fear, fatigue, loss of focus...the future of combat medicine lies in the mind of the soldier.
M	NNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Thanks to breakthroughs made by Aesir Pharmaceuticals, the military of tomorrow will be able of unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier.
M	H YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.)	ow has my experience in combat changed since being selected for Project Valhalla? I'm never scared, for starters.
F	MONA	That's the guy.
M	MAX	What are you talking about?
F	MONA	He's the one behind Ragna Rok. It's his club where the drug's being sold.
M	LUPINO (V.O.)	You face down a group of insurgents and instead of fear, you're filled with...peace, I guess. Like you're aware of the power you have in your own hands to make the world a better place.
M	ONA	So what do we do now?
F	MONA	What are you doing? Uncuff me. Hey!
M	W MONA	hat is this? You think just because he killed your partner, you can decide whether I--
M	MAX	He killed my wife.
F	MONA	I've been inside that club. You don't have a chance on your own. But you don't care.
F	MONA	You don't want my help, because you think if he puts you out of your misery, you'll get to see her again.
M	E	Without a look back, Max starts out the door.
F	MONA	I hope that's really the way it works. nto a bent spoon, Lupino taps greenish powder from a small
M	GUARD #1	All quiet, 4 a.m.
M	GUARD	Screw this... He pulls the door shut. It won't. Something's blocking it. W ait here, Mr. Lupino.
M	UPINO	I don't need protection. I have my own. ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised. Hunting.
M	LUPINO	an you hear them, now? XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
M	LUPINO	We'll see which one us they're flying for. We'll see who they love best. In that instant, Max pulls the knife from his own shoulder
M	MAX	Who is your contact at Aesir?
M	MAX	Who sent you after Michelle? L UPINO You are so blessed.
M	MAX	ou don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
M	LUPINO	The angels are not done with you yet.
M	MAX	BB? And BB walks right on by.
M	AX	What's going on here, BB?
M	B	B t ease, soldier.
M	MAX	Hey!
M	JOE SALLE	Now?
M	BB	Not unless you feel like carrying him out of here. Max knows me, and I definitely don't know Mr. Lupino.
M	MAX	Look at me, BB. At least face what you're doing...
M	BB	row up.
M	B	Happy New Year. Look at it from my perspective: this thing is going to be a true epidemic. One hundred percent dependence within a few doses, and we control the only source. This is so much bigger than Lupino's little bar. This is every street corner in the City in a month, nation wide in two. B B I hope you're not over there blaming me. Really, this is Michelle's fault.
M	BB	She had no right to put me in that situation. Asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my bosses...I'm sorry, but that's unreasonable.
M	BB	But then again, who could blame her for getting confused, being married to such a righteous man. So maybe it is your fault, after all. Just like your old man. Always knew you were better than everyone else--
M	MAX	No. Just better than you.
M	BB	For what it's worth, he didn't know Michelle was going to die.
M	BB	He thought they were going out there to scare her, destroy her research. FLASHBACK: MAX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
M	R	
M	BB	I'd arranged with the other guys to finish the job.
M	BB (V.O.)	He locked them out of the bedroom, tried CPR...boy scout shit.
M	BB	And as thanks, you nearly blew his head off while he crawled out the window.
M	B	B watches eagerly, waiting for what comes next... FLASHBACK: MAX'S BEDROOM - DUSK That's funny, to me.
M	BB	You really didn't know?
M	AX	You should have killed me then, when you had a chance.
M	BB	I learned something from your father, years ago. Always give people a choice.
M	BB	He gave me the choice between early retirement or facing the charges he was going to bring against me. He sat me down in that bar and explained that I could either give up the thing I loved, or I could have it taken away by force. That (was my choice.
M	I	You could have put a gun in your mouth any time you wanted. Or, you could have kept living in the hell I made for you. That's your choice.
M	BB	Just out of curiosity, though: why don't I have a chance now?
M	MAX	Because now I know it's you.
M	BB	Well, you're--
M	JOE SALLE	Okay, enough. This is far enough.
M	B	B Hang on.
M	JOE SALLE	BB...
M	BB	've got something better. B motions for Max and Joe Salle to follow him out onto the
M	BB	Grab me some of that rope.
M	BB	It's not like we didn't see it coming.
M	BB	Sullen, withdrawn...Max just never seemed the same after the tragedy.
M	BB	It's a good thing his father didn't live to see it, though. Bill Payne's only son, a strung-out suicide.
M	BB	It would have eaten him alive.
M	MAX	Bravura's not going to buy it.
M	BB	Sure? Not even once the autopsy turns up traces in your blood?
M	BB	dosed you that night at Alex's, just to make sure things were fuzzy. Compliments of the house.
M	J	
M	BB	oe, why don't you calm down... IER
M	BB	It's fine, as cold as that water is... Just in case, though. Make sure.
M	JOE SALLE	How? stepping quiet, past the bloody and motionless bodies.
F	MICHELLE	Are you home? he CAPTAIN steps out onto deck, zipping his coat against the
M	APTAIN	You know how blind I am, I'm not crashing into the dock again. When the power--
M	CAPTAIN	ang on a second.
M	APTAIN	Jumpers.
M	CAPTAIN	oly shit... Somebody get out here!
M	FIRST MATE	It's too late. He's frozen solid.
M	CAPTAIN	Somebody get some blankets.
M	CAPTAIN	all the cops, he's bleeding everywhere.
M	CAPTAIN	on't move. We've got help coming.
M	IRST MATE	What is that? What's he...
M	APTAIN	Great, a junkie bleeding on my boat.
M	M	He doesn't really feel that bad...
M	CAPTAIN	What do you mean, he's a block of ice...
M	FIRST MATE	Maybe it's a fever already. Let him go, then.
M	BRAVURA	Okay. Again, from the beginning.
M	U RANKING OFFICER	nder what authority are you interrogating these men?
M	RAVURA	An investigation into departmental corruption. They're material witnesses--
M	RANKING OFFICER	Just between you and me, I wouldn't count on these men being any kind of witnesses at all. I served with a few of them, and remember what kind of officers they were.
M	BRAVURA	What kind would that be?
M	RANKING OFFICER	Cops. Real cops.
M	RANKING OFFICER	o offense.
M	BRAVURA	None taken. Agent Taliente, I'd like you to meet a real cop.
M	DETECTIVE	Let me talk to BB.
M	JOE SALLE	What's going on downtown?
M	BB	Bravura called in the Feds.
M	BB	or God's sake, come on. Max is dead, they've got nothing else.
M	B	Get up to the armory, hide the--
M	JOE SALLE	He's not dead. He's here.
M	BB	Bullshit. There's no way--
M	JOE SALLE	Who are you calling?
M	BB	Her.
M	NICOLE HORNE	This isn't a number you use. building. NThe storm's breaking...
M	NICOLE HORNE	here was a shoot-out in my building yesterday, twenty floors from where I'm sitting. A secretary was killed.
M	BB	I understand an executive named Jason Colvin was also among the dead. Senseless tragedies, all.
M	BB	Everything's fine, we're just--
M	NICOLE HORNE	This was more than you were ready for.
M	BB	What is that supposed to mean?
M	NICOLE HORNE	Perhaps our partnership has run its course.
M	BB	Think pretty hard about that. I'm about to be surrounded by Federal agents--
M	NICOLE HORNE	Good heavens, BB. Best of luck.
M	BB	Who needs luck? They're going to love the stories I can tell.
M	NICOLE HORNE	Careful.
M	BB	Send the helicopter, then.
M	NICOLE HORNE	It's on its away.
M	BB	Take everybody and get downstairs. I want no less than his head. uddenly, an office down the hall bursts to life - a ROAR of
M	BB	Take some C4, wire it so he can't make it to the roof. I'll wait on the chopper.
M	BB	You know I won't leave without you.
F	MONA	Max! AX'S HALLUCINATION
F	MONA	You don't have much time.
F	MONA	I'll do what I can to slow them down, but you have to hurry.
F	MONA	You're not done yet.
M	BB	The weather's broken, your pilot is going to have no problem landing.
F	MONA	Where's the detonator?
M	JOE SALLE	There's more like this all over. Even if the building doesn't collapse, this floor is gone. Careful with that thing, is what I'm saying. I'm sure you and I can work something out.
M	UARDS	Drop your weapon!
M	JOE SALLE	Hurry, Max's already upstairs. Just hand it over.
M	JOE SALLE	B's done for, but this thing doesn't have to stop. I'm his number two, and somebody has to take over for Lupino. Like I said, we can work something out.
M	JOE SALLE	Give me one reason we can't do business. T he window Max stands in front of SHATTERS in the EXPLOSION, Try to take Payne alive, if there's anything left.
M	BB	It's unbelievable. All that snow, and... Watch it end up being a beautiful day.
M	BB	You want my confession, first? You came all this way for it...
M	BB	Forgive me, Max, for I have sinned. I should have bet more on you, and less on that helicopter.
M	BB	Just get to it, already. That's all I ask. You've earned it, so just...
M	BB	But I want you to listen to me, first. Just try to hear what--
M	MAX'S VOICE	I don't believe in heaven.
M	MAX'S VOICE	But I have this idea about it.
