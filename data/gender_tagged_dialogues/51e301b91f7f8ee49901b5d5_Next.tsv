M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	Ferris on monitor	Mr. Johnson, you've been sent to us by the state authorities for testing. We want to determine if there's any substance to your claims.
M	CrIS	Fire away.
M	FERRIS ON MONITOR	If we can verify your ability, we may be able to help you avoid a criminal trial.
M	CRIS	And "we" is...?
M	Ferris ON MONITOR	Homeland Security.
M	Ferris ON MONITOR	Now if you would, please look at the monitor and tell us what you see, say, five minutes from now. Are you there yet?
M	CrIS	Surfers.
M	Ferris (o.c.)	Good. Now can you move ahead ten minutes.
M	cris	Ants crawling up a tree.
M	Ferris (o.c.)	Excellent. Can you get to 1900 hours?
M	Mirror	
M	Woman's voice	Sir...Sir?
M	WAITRESS	Warm-up?
M	CRIS	Just the check. "The future ain't what it used to be." Ever hear that expression?
M	CRIS (V.O.)	It's a joke, but it's true. The future changes every time you look at it. Because you looked at it. Cause once you see it, you're different.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	Maybe just a little.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	And that changes everything else.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	It's got something to do with quantum physics.
M	Cris (V.O.)	That's why I stay away from roulette and craps. It only takes a millionth of an ounce to change a roll. Just placing a different bet can throw things off.
M	CRIS (v.O.)	I've got other rules, too. I don't play against people, like at poker. Only against the house.
M	CRIS (v.o.)	And my goal isn't to win big. At least not any more. The idea is to go unnoticed so I can keep coming back to the trough. So no jackpots. No longshots. No big bets except when I want `em to see me lose.
M	CRIS	Try that one, man. I've got a feeling.
M	Gambler	Then you play it.
M	CRIS	Against my religion.
M	CRIS	Do it, quick, before somebody else gets there.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring but controllable.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	And safe unless they think you're counting. The dealer turns over his cards. He's got a king and a deuce.
M	casino boss	If you don't mind my asking, why does Homeland Security give a damn about who's lucky in Vegas?
M	Ferris	Maybe they're more than lucky.
M	casino boss	Then we handle it.
M	Ferris	I'm not talking about cheating. That's your problem. But if somebody wins consistently and you can't figure out how...Excuse me.
M	Ferris	Ferris...I'll be there in fifteen.
F	FERRIS	Call me, like they did. And try to hold him till I get here.
M	Casino boss	Yes, ma'am.
M	Ferris (o.c.)	Nice looking guy. I guess.
M	Ferris	Maybe she's in cahoots.
M	davis	He's beaten six dealers in a row.
M	ferriS	You're sure he's not counting?
M	hawkeye	We've got five decks in the shoe. And he wins more off the top than the bottom.
M	davis	Moves a lot from table to table.
M	hawkeye	Keeps his stacks short.
M	WAITRESS	What's your pleasure?
M	CRIS	Grand Dad, rocks.
M	Ferris	What's his name?
M	davis	Not staying here. Pays in cash.
M	Hawkeye	We're running him through face check.
M	Ferris	Invite him for a drink. If you don't mind.
M	black suit (o.S.)	Sir, would you come with us, please.
M	WAITRESS	What's your pleasure?
M	CRIS	Scuse me, sorry.
M	davis	What's wrong with you guys?
M	hawkeye	He's right next to you! Aisle 63!
M	Davis	There! There! He's right there in front of you! Walk toward each other!
M	hawkeye	Maybe he's on our frequency.
M	DAVIS	I don't see an earphone on him.
M	hawkeye	He's heading to the Convention Annex.
F	FERRIS	Give me a headset. I'm going down there.
M	Ferris	He's heading toward... the Ipanema Grill.
F	FERRIS	You! I just need to talk to you!
F	FERRIS	Homeland Security!
M	davis	You were right. This guy is a lot more than lucky.
M	ferrIS	At least now I know he exists.
M	Ferris	Jeannie, I have to see him right away.
M	Jeannie	He's on with Washington. We just went on Code Orange.
M	Ferris	What's the threat?
M	JEANNIE	We found a dirty bomb in East Vegas. A barrel of C-4 and a kilo of nuclear waste. But we're getting chatter about a dozen more out there somewhere, ready to blow.
M	Ferris	Tell him I have a new source that could help with the case.
M	JEANNIE	Another remote viewer?
M	Ferris	Have him meet me in imaging.
M	CrIS	Thanks, guys. Not too heavy on the starch.
M	male voice (O.s.)	You pulled me out of a conference call with the Secretary to show me a video game? I need six men to bring him in.
M	WISDOM	We're on Code Orange.
M	Ferris	He could help us find the other bombs.
M	WISDOM	That's an ultra low probability. None of your "specials" have ever panned out, and this isn't the time to experiment.
F	FERRIS	Come on, Eric, you saw it. We're flying blind and he's got radar.
M	WISDOM	Callie, people are talking. They say I'm only funding your research because we're involved.
M	FeRRIS	That's because they're....
M	WISDOM	Right.
M	WISDOM	I'm sorry, but they're right.
F	FERRIS	You bastard.
M	WISDOM	I care about you, and I wanted to support you. But there's a limit to what I can...
F	FERRIS	Look, we analyzed what this ability would look like if it existed. I went screening for it in a highly scientific way. And now I've identified someone who matches all the indicators. So the next obvious step is to...
M	wisdom	Let me do my job! - Christ! Don't you ever quit?
F	FERRIS	No. I've got a country to protect.
M	WISDOM	Use your charm on somebody else. I'm not God. I don't see everything. Just my own future.
M	Cris (v.O.)	To me, it seems normal. The way lightning comes before thunder.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	Most of the time, I'm not paying attention. Just making sure I don't step in a mess. Sometimes I get a blast from far away.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	Or I can start with a glimpse of something close and keep pushing on.
M	CRIS (V.O.)	Usually it's none of my business.
M	CRIS	Guy around?
M	MANAGER	You are?
M	CRIS	Tell him it's King Midas.
F	FERRIS	Terry? Terry! - I know you've got your hands full but I was wondering if you might be able to spare a few warm bodies for an outside operation.
M	BAINES	We're strictly internal.
F	FERRIS	That's why I need your people. Everybody else is assigned.
M	BAINES	Does Wisdom know about this?
F	FERRIS	He suggested it.
M	AMANDA	Callie. Agent Ferris. I've got a face match on your subject. His name is Cris Johnson.
M	fERRIS	Never mind, Terry. Pretty Boy here is wanted for murder in Nevada.
M	Guy	Well, if it isn't the Golden Man.
M	Guy	What brings you crawling back to me? I need to cash some chips. - Got tagged.
M	GUY	You burned through your stash already?
M	CRIS	I've been trying to lay low.
M	CavANAUGH (o.s.)	That's him. I call him the Road Runner. You know? Beep beep.
M	Ferris	What's he running from?
M	CAVANAUGH	You showed me yours. I'll show you mine.
M	CRIS	He was gonna kill you! You all would'a died!
M	Guy	But you of all people. How could you have let it happen?
M	CRIS	That was the night Donna broke off our engagement.
M	GUY	Ahh.
M	CRIS	I was so drunk I could barely see now.
M	GUY	Well, I hope you don't mind. I called Neal to let him know you're here.
M	CRIS	Christ, Guy, did you have to?
M	GUY	You say everything's inevitable, so I guess I did.
M	CRIS	Well, you can save your breath. Cause I know what you're gonna say.
M	GUY	Then you're aware that Neal is in a serious cash crunch and could lose it all.
M	CRIS	I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm done playing the market.
M	GUY	Neal's got it all worked out. He'll fly you out of the country on his jet. Put you up in style. He pays taxes, totally legal. You get cash, squeaky clean. Half the net. When your share hits fifty mil, you can say "finito"...and it's over.
M	CRIS	Except last time, Neal didn't take "finito" for an answer.
M	GUY	You need us, asshole! The Law is breathin' down your neck!
M	CRIS	I can stay ahead of `em forever.
M	GUY	But why live that way?
M	CRIS	Because I don't want to be used any more.
M	GUY	What do you give a shit as long as you get what you want?
M	CRIS	Cause what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up. Enjoy it while it lasts.
M	CRIS	Looking for this?
M	CRIS	Don't mess with somebody who knows your moves before you even think 'em.
M	GUY	The jet'll be sold in a week. Then there goes your ticket out.
M	CRIS	Don't wait for me.
M	Guy	You know what I think? I think I know the future better than you do.
M	CAVANAUGH	He's just some gambler. Lives completely off the grid. No bank account. No credit cards. No previous record.
M	Ferris	So why'd he do it?
M	CAVANAUGH	Must be a wacko. He'd never met the victim. No connection whatsoever.
M	feRRIS	And in fifteen months, why haven't you caught him?
M	CAVANAUGH	You saw. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He can see around corners. I even had him in custody once, and he disappeared.
M	Ferris	Must be very embarrassing.
M	CAVANAUGH	And what is it you want him for?
M	Ferris	Questioning.
M	CAVANAUGH	About?
M	Ferris	Stuff that hasn't happened yet.
M	CAVANAUGH	Well, I guess Homeland Security trumps liquor store murder. How can I help?
M	IRV	What are you doing back here?
M	CRIS	I came to fix you dinner.
M	IRV	Idiot.
M	IRV	This is what you get from two packs a day.
M	CrIS	But you quit ten years ago.
M	IRV	It was already too late. I just didn't know it.
M	CRIS	Sometimes not knowing is better.
M	IRV	Look where you're headed, pal. The big decisions are over before you even realize you made `em.
M	CaVANAUGH	Any idea where he might be going?
M	GUY	I've got a little problem with the IRS. Think I could get some relief?
F	FERRIS	Depends how helpful you are.
M	GuY	Oh, I know everything about him.
F	FERRIS	I need to speak to him alone.
M	GUY	And another thing, no woman ever turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly because he only propositions the ones he knows'll say yes, which is most of `em anyway. But does that make him happy? No. Says he's bored. Never surprised. Has to watch himself die over and over again.
F	FERRIS	Why'd he come back to Vegas?
M	GUY	Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's this friend who's dying. An old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs. - He's an orphan, ya know. Been on the road since he was ten.
M	IRV	You want my advice? Get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in.
M	CRIS	If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me?
M	IRV	Make you a secret agent.
M	Cris	Don't laugh. They strap me in a chair and make me watch the news.
M	IRV	Dan Rather or Peter Jennings?
M	CRIS	It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak.
M	Irv	There's no way around it?
M	CRIS	The best I can do is stay away from all of `em.
M	IRV	In that case, you've gotta leave the country.
M	CRIS	I know, I know, but there's something I gotta do first.
M	IRV	What?
M	IRV	Cris?
M	CRIS	She's coming here. The Fed.
M	IRV	You gotta go?
M	CRIS	Let's play it out.
M	CRIS	I've got the place all picked out. It's called Palau. Three hundred teeny islands in the South Pacific. Nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee.
M	IRV	Then what the hell are you waiting for?
M	CRIS	Her.
M	IRV	Who?
M	CRIS	I haven't met her yet.
M	IRV	Then find somebody else! It has to be her.
M	IRV	What's so special about this one?
M	CRIS	She's the mother of my child.
M	IRV	I thought you were shooting blanks.
M	CRIS	I guess the doctors were wrong.
M	IRV	I don't mean to be indelicate, my friend, but how do you know the little bastard is yours?
M	CRIS	He's got my thing.
M	IRV	Your thing?
M	CRIS	My thing.
M	IRV	I still don't understand why you never got that fixed.
M	cris	She's here.
M	CRIS	Agent Ferris, come in.
F	FERRIS	One step ahead of the game.
M	cRIS	Always.
M	Ferris	Is there some place we can speak privately?
M	CRIS	Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a roast in the oven.
M	IrV	No, you two stay here. I'll watch the food.
F	FERRIS	You're wasting your life, Cris. You have the most amazing talent, and you're running from it.
M	CRIS	Yeah, people say I could have been a chef.
M	Ferris	Don't be cute. There's too much at stake here.
F	FERRIS	Now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people, I believe you. Why else would you kill a stranger?
F	FERRIS	But no good deed goes unpunished, eh? And that's how it's going to be in this world. People will either hate you or want to exploit you.
M	CRIS	Everyone but you, of course.
F	FERRIS	I can fix your legal problems. More importantly, I can give you a chance to use your gift.
M	CRIS	Trust me, it's better if I don't. It's better if I just mind my own business.
F	FERRIS	I'll be honest with you, Cris. That's not an option. Your country needs you. And if we don't grab you, somebody else will.
M	CRIS	Nobody's grabbed me yet.
M	Ferris	You're up against more powerful forces now.
F	FERRIS	I'd like you to come with me for some testing. Would you be willing to do that?
F	FERRIS	Where are you going?
F	FERRIS	Shit! Cavanaugh!
M	IRV	In that case, you've gotta leave the country.
M	CRIS	I know, I know, I've got the place picked out. But there's something I've gotta do first.
M	IRV	What?
M	IRV	Cris?
M	CRIS	I have to go.
M	IRV	You just got here.
M	CRIS	I know, but they're coming for me.
M	CRIS	This is for nurses and stuff, to make things a little easier.
M	IRV	You're gonna need it.
M	CrIS	You're the only one I could trust. Ever.
M	IRV	I don't suppose you've discovered any last minute escape for me?
M	CRIS	I looked, Irv, I really did. I went down every path, every treatment. Sometimes there's just no...
M	IRV	It's okay. It's okay...Now I can relax.
M	Cris	Twenty-four minutes.
F	FERRIS	I need him alive, Cavanaugh. Even if he resists.
M	CAVANAUGH	Yes, ma'am.
F	FERRIS	Tell them.
M	Irv	You'll never catch him. He knows what you're gonna do to him.
F	FERRIS	That's very helpful information.
M	CrIS	Medium coffee, black, and a glazed.
M	CRIS	Mind if I join you?
F	LIZ	Yeah, actually I do.
M	CRIS	Is that cruller any good?
M	CRIS	Shopping for a car?
F	LIZ	What business is it of yours?
M	CRIS	Rough day?
M	lIZ	I don't want to talk about it.
F	LIZ	Aw Christ! Look what you've done!
M	CRIS	I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz.
F	LIZ	Yeah, you are.
F	LIZ	It looked like you spilled it on purpose.
M	CRIS	Why would I do that?
F	LIZ	I don't know. To impress me?
M	CRIS	Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do it over.
M	CRIS	Here.
M	Liz	Divorce, bankruptcy, repossession. Yeah, I'd call that a bad year.
M	CRIS	Well, Liz, your luck's about to change.
F	LIZ	How's that?
M	CRIS	You met me.
F	LIZ	And what are you, a leprechaun?
M	CRIS	An angel, actually. And we always reward the people who help us.
F	LIZ	Great, what do I have to do?
M	CRIS	You don't have to do anything.
M	CRIS	But I could use a ride.
F	LIZ	When does the luck kick in?
M	CRIS	It already has.
F	LIZ	I don't feel anything.
M	CRIS	Not even a tingle?
F	LIZ	Son, I haven't had a tingle in eight months.
M	Liz	Since my worthless no-good dickhead of a husband ran out on me.
M	CRIS	Then you're way overdue. For a reversal of fortune.
M	CRIS	Any kids?
F	LIZ	Thirty. I teach fifth grade.
M	CRIS	I mean of your own.
M	CRIS	I guess that's good. Considering.
F	LIZ	No, that was the problem. - I couldn't get pregnant.
M	CRIS	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
F	LIZ	You didn't. I'm just running off at the mouth. - That's why I was in Vegas. To see another doctor.
M	CRIS	He didn't want to adopt?
F	LIZ	No, he had to have a Randy Junior.
F	LIZ	What, is there an accident?
F	LIZ	When does the luck kick in?
M	CRIS	It already has.
F	LIZ	I don't feel anything.
M	CRIS	Take this exit. Quick!
F	LIZ	Why?
M	CRIS	Just take it! The dotted lines on the road are now solid.
F	LIZ	It's too late!
M	CRIS	No it's not!
F	LIZ	Let go! Are you out of your mind?!
F	LIZ	Get out!
M	CRIS	Traffic was piling up. You didn't see it?
F	LIZ	
M	CRIS	We could'a been stuck there for hours.
F	LIZ	I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel!
M	CRIS	You're right. I'm sorry. I panicked. I get phobic sitting in traffic. It won't happen again, I promise.
F	LIZ	Damn straight, cause you won't be in the car! How `bout at the next gas station? Please. I'll fill up your tank.
M	Ferris	You're wasting time here.
M	CaVANAUGH	How long have you been in law enforcement? About six months?
F	FERRIS	Long enough to know we're not gonna catch him by surprise.
M	CAVANAUGH	What, you think he's got some kind of radar?
F	FERRIS	Interesting idea. It'd explain a whole lot.
M	CAVANAUGH	And Area 51 would explain my missing tennis shoes. But that doesn't mean they're on a flying saucer.
F	FERRIS	In this case, it does.
M	CRIS	I am really really really really sorry.
M	Liz	Get in the car. I'll be back in a minute.
M	CAVANAUGH	I'd call your proof a little iffy.
F	FERRIS	Look, from your own experience, this guy can't be punched, shot, surprised, captured, or confined. So either he's got something special, or you're an idiot.
M	CAVANAUGH	Let's say I'm not an idiot...
F	FERRIS	And I'm not saying you are.
M	CAVANAUGH	Then what?
F	FERRIS	We've got to think like he does. We've got to think ahead.
M	CRIS	But lately I've been traveling all around Oregon. It's really peaceful up there.
F	LIZ	All right, I'm starting getting the picture. - Basically, you're a no- good, worthless ramblin' man who's never held a job in life.
M	CRIS	Exactly.
M	liz	At least you're honest about it.
F	LIZ	This is where I turn into town.
M	CRIS	Well, thanks for the ride.
F	LIZ	Thanks for the card.
M	CRIS	You're welcome.
M	cRIS	I don't suppose you'd have time for a drink.
F	LIZ	No, no, I've gotta teach tomorrow.
M	CRIS	I understand...Well, see ya.
F	LIZ	So long.
F	LIZ	Well, maybe just a quick one.
F	LIZ	Hey, George.
M	Bartender	Hey, Liz.
F	LIZ	I'll take the usual and he'll have a...
M	CRIS	Sierra Pale.
M	Bartender	Two Sierras.
M	BartENDER	Randy's been hanging around.
F	LIZ	He's not here now, is he?
F	LIZ	Thanks.
F	LIZ	We gotta split. My ex is here.
M	Randy	I gotta talk to you, baby.
F	LIZ	Sure, Randy. I'll call you tomorrow.
M	Randy	Bullshit. I've left a dozen messages on your phone.
M	Cris	Excuse me. We were just leaving.
M	Randy	And who the hell are you?
M	Liz	Don't mess with him, Cris. He used to play hockey.
M	CRIS	Just a friend.
M	Randy	Then don't get between me and my woman.
F	LIZ	I'm not yours anymore, asshole!
M	Randy	Baby, I've made a terrible mistake, and I just want to undo all the...
M	liz	Let go!
M	RANDY	You still care for me, I know it.
M	CRIS	Easy, man.
F	LIZ	Get out of here! Get out!
M	RANDY	You still care for me, I know it.
M	CRIS	Easy, man.
F	LIZ	Stop it, Randy! Stop it!
F	LIZ	Get out of here! Get out!
F	LIZ	Oh God, I'll take you to the emergency room.
M	CRIS	No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital.
F	LIZ	God, I hate that bastard...Will somebody get some ice!
M	CRIS	I'm sorry I'm causing you all this trouble.
F	LIZ	Are you kidding? You stood up for me.
M	CRIS	Actually, I wasn't standing for that long.
F	LIZ	Sorry it's so cold in here. The heater's broken.
F	LIZ	I really should've left him a long time ago. God knows he deserved it.
M	CRIS	Why didn't you?
F	LIZ	Cause I don't leave. I never have. My boyfriends always left me.
F	LIZ	I get attached to people, and then I'll put up with anything.
M	CRIS	What a terrible quality. You're too loyal.
F	LIZ	Sit in the light.
F	LIZ	I never minded that I was the more devoted one. Somebody's gotta be more this or more that.
F	LIZ	But they never appreciate it, that you're there for them.
F	LIZ	They just try and get away with more and more, and figure you'll just...
F	LIZ	Salty.
F	LIZ	Christ, I don't even know you. I have no idea who you are.
F	LIZ	Sorry to get you caught up in my soap opera.
M	CRIS	Once you start watching, it's hard not to get involved.
F	LIZ	You ever been married?
M	CRIS	Almost.
F	LIZ	What happened?
M	CRIS	She wanted kids.
F	LIZ	And you didn't?
M	CRIs	No, I did, too. She looks at him, curious.
M	CRIS	It's just that...I can't.
F	LIZ	Why are you telling me this? These personal details.
M	CRIS	I don't know. You asked and...I guess I felt like you'd understand.
M	lIZ	I do.
M	lIZ	I can't either. Have kids.
M	CRIS	That was incredible.
M	LiZ	What was?
M	CRIS	This.
F	LIZ	That was...I've never...
M	expert 1	We sent the payload to Livermore, and by measuring the cesium degradation, they've identified the reactor in Smerlensk that it came from.
M	expert 2	Washington has our birds tracking for that radiation signature in key cities.
M	wisdom	What do we know about the explosive?
M	Expert 3	Our lab downstairs is still studying the C-4 sample. It's Czech, but we haven't nailed down the batch.
M	WISDOM	So basically we've got nothing.
M	WISDOM	You're failing your country, people. You're not trying hard enough. Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I expect from you?
M	WisDOM	TWIST ARMS! CRACK HEADS! BREAK THE FUCKIN' LAW! BUT DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN!
M	WISDOM	Are there any questions?
F	FERRIS	You know you're very sexy when you're ruthless.
M	WISDOM	We're groping in the dark.
F	FERRIS	My guy's got a flashlight. We just need to bring him in.
M	WISDOM	I'll see if Baines can spare some manpower.
M	FERRIs	You're all the manpower I need.
F	LIZ	What the hell are you doing?
M	CRIS	You said it was broken.
F	LIZ	Well, you're not leaving till it's fixed, I'll tell you that.
M	crIS	I'm afraid that could take a while.
F	LIZ	As long as it's done right.
M	FeRRIS	Did Wisdom talk to you?
M	BaiNES	What do you need?
F	FERRIS	This one first.
M	BAINES	What is it?
F	FERRIS	A trap for somebody who can see the future.
M	BAINES	If you say so.
F	FERRIS	And then these.
F	LIZ	And what was the main staple of their diet?
M	shy girl	Trout.
F	LIZ	From the lake?
M	SHY GIRL	No. From the rivers.
F	LIZ	Right. And the Washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other Native Americans came to trade for dried fish, they were only permitted to remain one night.
M	LIz	I'll be right back.
F	LIZ	What are you doing here?
M	CrIS	I brought ice cream sandwiches for everybody.
F	LIZ	Ice cream sandwiches? Do you have any idea how much fat they have in them? Don't you see how overweight half of them are?
M	CRIS	I - I didn't think of it. - I thought you'd be happy to see me.
F	LIZ	Well next time exercise a little forethought, okay?
M	CRIS	Do you want me to leave these somewhere?
F	LIZ	No.
M	CRIS	All right then. I'll just go.
F	LIZ	Put a few in the freezer. I love ice cream sandwiches.
F	LIZ	You have been such a bad influence. I'm gonna be up all night grading papers.
M	CRIS	I've got a better idea. Run away with me to the South Pacific.
F	LIZ	Funny. We've only known each other a week.
M	CRIS	But we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives. Really, I peeked.
F	LIZ	I think you're serious.
M	CRIS	Deadly.
M	CRIS	Let's go pack your bags. We'll leave tonight.
F	LIZ	And what'll we do for money?
M	CRIS	Don't worry. That's always been easy for me.
F	LIZ	This is ridiculous.
M	CRIS	Why?
F	LIZ	Well, first of all, it's the middle of the school year.
M	CRIS	They'll replace you.
F	LIZ	And I'm in charge of science fair.
M	CRIS	They can pick up the slack.
F	LIZ	It disturbs me, Cris, that you think it's okay just to duck your responsibilities.
M	CRIS	I - I don't think it's okay. I'm not that kind of person. But I have this feeling, this very strong feeling, that it has to be now. We have to leave soon, or it's not gonna work out.
F	LIZ	I don't believe that. If it's meant to be between two people, somehow it'll happen.
M	CRIS	Yes, but sometimes you have to make it happen. You have to seize the opportunity before it's too late.
F	LIZ	What are you afraid of, Cris? Why are you running away from yourself? Whatever it is you're looking for, I don't think you're going to find it on some island, cut off from the rest of the world.
M	CRIS	Your students are very lucky.
F	LIZ	Now I've got to grade papers.
M	Randy	A religious fella, are you? Ready to turn the other jaw?
M	CRIS	But then you have to sign the divorce papers.
M	LiZ	Randy, don't you dare.
M	Liz	Paul, Janice. Have you met Cris?
M	Randy	There's something weird about that jerk. Have you checked him out?
M	Policeman RICK	I'm not dragging the Law into your romantic squabbles, Randy.
M	Randy	C'mon, Rick, help me out here.
M	Paul	Cris, are you free on Tuesday? Cause I'd like you to be my guest at the Rotary luncheon.
M	Janice	I'm the first female member.
M	Paul	Cris, are you free on Tuesday? Cause I'd like you to be my guest at the Rotary luncheon.
M	Janice	I'm the first female member.
F	LIZ	Cris.
M	CrIS	Miss! Lady! Don't!
M	CrIS	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for the damages.
M	CRIS	I said I'll pay.
M	DRIVER	You're damn right you'll pay! I wanna talk to the cops.
M	CRIS	No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash?
M	CriS	Two thousand? That should cover it.
M	DRIVER	Make it three.
M	CRIS	Okay, three. ON RANDY and POLICEMAN RICK
M	POLICEMAN riCK	I'll run him through the computer.
M	criS	People shouldn't drive that fast around kids. They shouldn't get away with it.
F	LIZ	So you throw rocks at them?
M	CRIS	What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die?
F	LIZ	Cris...I think you should move on. Today.
M	CRIS	Look, there's something I've been wanting to tell you.
F	LIZ	It doesn't matter.
M	CRIS	It does.
M	CaVANAUGH	Cavanaugh...No, you were right to call...Ring Ferris and have her meet me there.
M	CaVANAUGH	They've located him near Tahoe.
M	CaVANAUGH's wife	If you let him get away again, you may not have a job.
M	CAVANAUGH	I know.
F	LIZ	What are you saying, you're some sort of prophet?
M	CRIS	It's not religious. I just happen to see my life before it happens.
F	LIZ	Cris, it's sweet that you feel responsible for people. But I think you need help.
M	LiZ	And I'm...I'm not the one to help you, right now. I've got too much going on in my own life.
M	CRIS	Flip it.
F	LIZ	Why? Just do it.
M	CRIS	Heads.
M	CRIS	Flip it again. Tails.
M	CRIS	Tails. Heads. Tails.
M	CRIS	Now you believe me?
F	LIZ	Yeah. And I don't want to have anything to do with you.
M	CRIS	Liz. Don't you see? I can get us all the money we need.
F	LIZ	Don't follow me. Don't talk to me. Get out of my life! WALKING IN THE PARK - fiVE MINUTES AGO
M	Cris	What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die?
F	LIZ	Cris...I think you should move on. Today.
M	CRIS	Why? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact?
M	ferris (o.s.)	Who's the woman?
M	POLICEMAN rick	Liz Cooper. Nice girl, but very erratic.
M	cAVANAUGH	Think she'll cooperate?
M	POLICEMAN RICK	Hard to say. She's impossible to control.
M	Ferris	Sounds like you've tried.
M	POLICEMAN RICK	She's quite a challenge.
F	LIZ	I swear, I can't figure you out.
M	CRIS	Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
F	LIZ	Sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive. But other times I feel like you're utterly calculating, saying exactly what you think'll push my buttons.
M	CRIS	What do you mean?
F	LIZ	Don't you think it's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids?
M	CRIS	You want to talk to my doctor? I'll get him on the phone. No, really, I mean it. I'll have him send you my records. Because I want you to trust me.
F	LIZ	Then open up. Talk to me. Where are you going with your life?
M	crIS	Wherever it takes me.
M	LiZ	You never think about the future?
M	CRIS	All the time. - But mainly how to stay out of trouble.
F	LIZ	No goals? Dreams? Ambitions?
M	CRIS	There's only one thing I've ever wanted.
F	LIZ	What's that?
M	CRIS	A family.
F	LIZ	That's all? Just a family?
M	CRIS	Well, I was, as they say, left on a doorstep when I was two. Never found foster parents who could put up with me. - So to me, a family sounds like plenty.
F	LIZ	You've got to be making this up.
M	CRIS	I wish.
F	LIZ	You poor guy.
M	CAVANAUGH	I say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass.
M	Ferris	And by that time, his ass'll be long gone.
M	CAVANAUGH	Then why won't he see through your trap?
M	Ferris	Let's try this one more time.
F	LIZ	I'll meet you inside. I need to pick something up at the drug store.
F	FERRIS	Stay in the car. If he sees your shadow, he won't take the bait.
M	CaVANAUGH	We hear you.
M	Ferris	I'm serious. This guy can smell your farts before you even eat the beans.
M	rick	Miss, I won't even think about beans.
M	Rick	Sounds like a crock to me.
M	CAVANAUGH	You haven't been chasing him for three years.
M	Ferris	Miss Cooper.
F	LIZ	Yes?
F	FERRIS	Agent Ferris.
F	LIZ	He's not a killer. He needs help.
M	Ferris	I agree. But he has a long history of resisting arrest, and the state wants to hunt him down with fifty trigger-happy cops.
F	LIZ	You're not gonna let them.
F	FERRIS	That's why I came to you.
F	LIZ	Okay, I'll talk to him. I'll try to get him to...
F	FERRIS	Even his best friend says he'll never turn himself in. - At this stage, there's only one way to keep him from self-destructing.
M	crIS	What took so long?
F	LIZ	I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in a while. Liz holds out a single key on a ring.
F	LIZ	She said we could use her cabin up at the peak.
M	caVANAUGH	Did you tell her about the future thing?
M	Ferris	Of course not. I wanted her to believe me. - But I loaded her up with liquor, to dim his headlights.
M	CRIS	God, this is gorgeous.
M	CRIS	What's wrong?
F	LIZ	Nothing.
M	baines	Okay, when you press the remote, the cabin will lock down like a big jail cell.
F	FERRIS	But silently, right?
M	BAINES	Unnoticeably.
M	CAVANAUGH	And that's when we go in.
M	Ferris	You still don't get it. This has to be clear to your whole army. And yours. -- After she comes out and we lock down the cabin...We don't do anything. We wait.
M	Policeman RICK	But if he's already trapped...?
F	FERRIS	Gentlemen, try to think like him. - If the plan is to go in right after he's trapped, he'll see it coming and he'll slip away before he's trapped... Like he's always done.
M	cavANAUGH	How does your plan change anything?
M	baines	At least he won't hear it when the trap closes.
F	FERRIS	And if he doesn't know he's trapped, he can't foresee knowing he's trapped.
M	CAVANAUGH	That kinda makes sense. The eureka moment is when he realizes he's been trapped.
M	CAVANAUGH	When is that?
M	ferriS	That's the point. We want to delay "eureka" for as long as possible. So by the time he sees trouble and decides to waltz away...
M	baines	He's already been in the trap for hours.
F	FERRIS	Voila.
M	RICK	You're smart.
F	LIZ	Cris. Do you think we met for a reason?
M	CRIS	You mean, do I believe a higher power brought us together?
F	LIZ	Yeah.
M	CRIS	No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang.
F	LIZ	That's not very romantic.
M	CRIS	Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together, right here and now.
M	CRIS	To whatever happens next.
F	LIZ	I shouldn't.
M	CRIS	Why?
F	LIZ	I'm late.
M	CRIS	Late?
F	LIZ	That's why I went to the drug store. To get a pregnancy test.
F	LIZ	You know what this means? I do now.
F	LIZ	How did it...?
M	CRIS	I have no idea. Unless...But that still doesn't explain...
M	CRIS	Liz, I really did have this problem. I wasn't lying to you.
M	CRIS	But this is good. This is amazing. I want this baby more than anything.
F	LIZ	It's like a miracle.
M	CRIS	For both of us.
M	baines	Think she'll come through?
F	FERRIS	Women hate good-looking men. Rejecting them makes us feel powerful.
M	Baines	And that's more important than love?
F	FERRIS	No. But she doesn't really love him.
M	CriS	Liz... Liz?
F	FERRIS	Surprise.
M	CRIS	You lying bitch! You betrayed me!
M	CRIS	Liz, please, I love you.
M	CRIS	Let me talk to you for one minute. I won't hurt you, I promise.
F	LIZ	Cris, I know you don't mean to hurt people. But you need help or you're going to keep on hurting them.
M	CRIS	The man I killed was there to rob the store. He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people.
F	LIZ	How do you know this?
M	CRIS	Because I saw them die.
F	LIZ	Like yesterday, with the car?
M	CRIS	Yes.
F	LIZ	You were afraid something bad might happen so you...
M	CRIS	Not "might"! Those people died! - They just hadn't died yet.
F	LIZ	What if you hadn't done anything? Have you ever waited to see what would happen?
M	CRIS	Once.
M	CRIS	That's why I don't go out much. So I won't be there to see.
M	CAVANAUGH	What's taking so long?
M	BAINES	We could just do this the old- fashioned way.
F	LIZ	Cris, you're a good man. And I will stand by you through this. But you have to...
M	CRIS	If they catch me, they'll put me in a cell without a trial, and they'll never let me out. They do that, you know.
F	LIZ	I won't let it happen. I'll get you a lawyer.
F	LIZ	Cris...Cris.
M	CRIS	There's one decent path. But if we're gonna stay on it, I need you to do exactly what I say.
M	CRIS	Will you give me one chance? One chance in exchange for a miracle?
M	caVANAUGH	We can't wait any longer. We've got to go in.
F	FERRIS	Okay. Wait for my signal.
M	CRIS	A few steps on, your robe will get caught on a thornbush. You won't be able to get unstuck. Ferris and a tough guy will come help you. She'll say, "You've done your country a great service."
F	LIZ	And then?
M	CRIS	Be unpredictable. Surprise works to my advantage. - And read this when you're safe.
F	LIZ	Will I see you again?
M	CRIS	Bet on it.
M	Ferris	She's coming now. We stay put. Tell them.
M	CAVANAUGH	We stand pat till notified. Don't make a sound.
F	FERRIS	What's she waiting for?
M	Ferris	You've done your country a great service.
F	LIZ	Then why do I feel like a traitor?
M	Ferris	Rick, get her some coffee.
M	CAVANAUGH	We've got movement in the canyon. Where are you?
M	bAINES	She told him.
M	CAVANAUGH	We tried it your way.
M	Ferris	Go for it. But I want him alive.
M	CAVANAUGH	Boys, now it's our turn.
F	FERRIS	I want him alive. Tell them.
M	CaVANAUGH	And the Feds want him alive.
M	Ferris	We need to get to him first.
F	FERRIS	You've made a very stupid mistake.
F	LIZ	I trust him more than I trust you.
M	Ferris	I wouldn't swallow the "I love you" part.
F	LIZ	You've never even met him.
F	FERRIS	But I've profiled him for months. And I can tell you this: he doesn't love anybody. How could he? To him, we're not even human. We're the characters in a videogame, and he's the player with the joystick. We say our lines, and he practices his moves until we do what he wants.
M	Trooper	There! I got him!
M	TrooPER 1	Stop!
M	troOPER 2	Take better aim!
M	TROOPER 1	I'm trying!
M	baines	You might be right about this guy.
F	FERRIS	I underestimated him.
F	FERRIS	By a lot.
M	Trooper	Shit!
M	ferriS	Be thorough, gentlemen. If you leave a way out, he'll find it.
M	TEAM leader	I've got two men down. Friendly fire.
F	FERRIS	Change of plans, everybody. Try to kill him. Use everything you've got. Is this a joke?
F	FERRIS	No, it's an order.
M	BaiNES	Don't get emotional here.
F	FERRIS	There's only one way to beat this man. He's got to see his own death, and not just maybe. He's got to see himself die again and again and know it's inescapable. And then, maybe, he'll surrender.
M	bAINES	And if he doesn't?
F	FERRIS	That'll be his choice. And he was no use to us anyway.
M	BAINES	Damn. Fifty men might not be enough.
F	FERRIS	Somehow we've got to bring him down to our level.
M	BaINES	Got any ideas?
F	FERRIS	I'm workin' on it.
M	BAINES	He's crossed over into Maxwell Gorge.
F	FERRIS	Move in fast. Keep him moving. Don't let him rest.
F	FERRIS	Don't give him time to look ahead. That's the key.
M	BAINES	He's heading this way.
M	feRRIS	Cavanaugh! We've got a fox hunt going in Maxwell Gorge, right beneath the stakeout. Throw everybody into it! We need to overload him!
M	FerrIS (o.c.)	Gentlemen, if he surrenders, fine, cuff him. But if he even shivers, shoot to kill.
M	CaVANAUGH	Lie down on your stomach, hands behind your head! You've got ten seconds. Ten seconds and we shoot.
M	CAVANAUGH	This is your last warning.
M	fERRIS	Keep after him! Quick! Stay on him!
M	baines	What the...?
M	CRIS	Believe me now?
F	LIZ	I'm getting used to miracles.
M	CRIS	Where were you going?
F	LIZ	No idea. I was just trying to be unpredictable.
F	LIZ	So what's the plan? Bonnie and Clyde?
M	CrIS	Remember that place in the South Pacific?
F	LIZ	It's starting to sound really good.
M	CRIS	I'll check on our ride.
M	Guy	Yeah...
M	Guy	No, the jet's not sold...I'm here with him now...Of course, he's pissed...I can ask.
M	Guy	He wants to know how soon the jet can be ready. I'll wait until eight o'clock. But if he's not there, I'm taking off without him.
M	cRIS	It's arranged. But we have to get to the North Vegas airport by eight.
F	LIZ	Will we make it?
M	CRIS	Right now I'm just trying to stay alive.
F	LIZ	Christ, you live dangerously.
M	CRIS	Just the opposite. I never take chances.
F	FERRIS	Cavanaugh, get all your men into town. Cavanaugh? Tell them.
M	BaINES	He's dead. Crashed.
F	FERRIS	You take command of the chase. Have cars block these intersection.
M	BAINES	Why these?
F	FERRIS	Get in the chopper.
M	CRIS	Did the doctors ever say why you couldn't have kids?
F	LIZ	I grew up at Love Canal.
M	CRIS	What's that?
F	LIZ	A neighborhood back East built over a chemical dump. A bunch of my friends had birth defects. I always figured I was lucky just to be sterile.
M	CRIS	Except you're not. And neither am I. We're different, that's all. We just had to find the right match.
F	LIZ	And somehow we did.
M	BAINES	He doesn't miss a beat.
F	FERRIS	Come to momma.
F	FERRIS	Stay after him. Keep the pressure on.
M	BAINES	He's driving right into it...
M	BAINES	Sometimes looking one step ahead isn't enough.
F	LIZ	You make it look easy.
M	CRIS	Oh shit. Oh no.
M	Liz	What is it?
M	CRIS	I blew it.
F	FERRIS	I need your vehicle.
M	BAINES	What's the plan?
F	FERRIS	Playing chicken.
M	BAINES	Don't be stupid! He knows what you'll do!
F	FERRIS	But so do I. And for once, that makes us even.
M	CRIS	GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE!
M	LiZ	What's going to happen?
M	cris	We'll find out.
F	FERRIS	Cuffs on both wrists. Leave him if he doesn't.
M	BaiNES	What can he do hanging by one arm?
F	FERRIS	I don't want to find out.
M	Baines	Both wrists!
F	FERRIS	I was wrong about one thing. He is capable of love.
M	Ferris	Cris Johnson, we meet at last.
M	CRIS	Why does everybody have amnesia but me?
F	FERRIS	I only ask one thing from you. Give me a chance to earn your trust.
M	cris	I did, and you failed.
F	FERRIS	Then give me another chance. You get `em all the time.
M	CRIS	Don't let them know you're pregnant.
M	CrIS	You don't have to raise him. But at least let him be born. Can you do that? It might be the only chance either of us gets.
F	LIZ	I promise.
F	LIZ	Work with them Cris. So we can be together.
M	CRIS	I'll get us out of here. We can still make the plane.
M	Wisdom	Are you out of your mind? Did you ever play chicken before?
F	FERRIS	This game was different. He knew I wouldn't flinch.
M	baINES	What's new with the Code Orange?
M	WISDOM	It's red now. And we're out of leads.
M	fERRIS	Then you better hope he's what I say he is.
M	WISDOM	Please, make me a believer. Electromagnets.
M	WiSDOM	Aren't you being a little over- cautious?
F	FERRIS	Not possible with him.
F	FERRIS	Cris, please step into the next room.
F	FERRIS	Cris, we'll be firing at you with live ammo. Are you ready?
M	WisDOM	You're shooting your secret weapon?
M	CrIS	You're paying for the shirt.
M	WisDOM	I hope you've got more than that.
F	FERRIS	Now we are going to use live ammo.
M	WISDOM	Not on my watch, you're not.
F	FERRIS	I promise you, he won't be hit.
M	WISDOM	It's your experiment.
M	CRIS	"From now on, Cris, the bullets are real."
F	FERRIS	He's almost impossible to shoot, hit, surprise, capture, or contain.
M	WISDOM	Mind if I try?
F	FERRIS	Be my guest. How do you know it's prevision? Maybe he's reading minds.
F	FERRIS	No minds to read. The guns are aimed automatically by infrared.
M	WiSDOM	What other tricks can he do?
M	ferris	Please step into the next room.
M	CRIS	I'm going. No need for a hotfoot.
M	BaiNES	The floor is electrified. He must have tried resisting and foreseen the result.
M	Ferris on monitor	Cris, it's time to get started with the next test. This won't be unpleasant. We just need to you sit in the chair.
M	Ferris on monitor	I want you to look ahead, tell me the time on the clock and then tell me what film clip you see playing. Let's start with five minutes from now. Then we'll press ahead as far as you're capable of. The clips have been assembled at random by a computer, so nobody knows what'll be playing next.
M	cris	Look, I'll stand here and tell you what I see.
M	Ferris on monitor	I'm afraid we need you to sit.
M	CRIS	Why?
M	Ferris on monitor	Why not?
M	CRIS	I know what happens.
M	Ferris oN MONITOR	Tell us.
M	CRIS	You tie me down and never let me out.
M	FerriS	That's only because you won't cooperate.
M	CRIS	Because you're trying to force me.
M	Ferris	Work with us, Cris, and you can be a hero. Fight us, and things will get worse and worse.
M	Ferris ON MONITOR	Now sit in the chair. One. Two. Three.
M	WISDOM	Whoa, you are one tough bitch.
F	FERRIS	We're still in a Code Red if I'm not mistaken.
M	WISDOM	He knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist.
F	FERRIS	He's almost never had to face consequences. Cris, are you ready to get in the chair?
F	FERRIS	We need information, right?
F	FERRIS	Leave him there. We'll start again when he recovers.
M	WISDOM	Okay, how do we use him to find the bombs?
F	FERRIS	Simple. We make him watch the news and tell us about it.
M	WISDOM	How far ahead can he see?
F	FERRIS	I don't know. But I suspect we can increase his range with practice. Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. Then he'll be like a timescope.
M	WISDOM	You were right. This is huge.
F	FERRIS	This is just for starters. You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin.
M	wisDOM	And all he's ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud?
M	FeRRIS	I know, it's amazing; but he's not ambitious.
M	WiSDOM	Damn, how will we control this guy when he figures out what he's capable of?
M	Ferris	We control him now. We just have to keep it that way.
M	WISDOM	Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair.
M	WISDOM	We've got to think this through. Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists.
M	Ferris	Aren't you running ahead of yourself?
M	WISDOM	With this guy, you have to. Or it'll be over before it begins.
M	Ferris	So we'll keep him in chains.
M	WISDOM	That may not be enough. We may have to cut off his arms and legs. Then I might start to feel safe.
M	Ferris	You're not serious.
M	WISDOM	Think about it. What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. And I'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, "He's so cute. Let's keep him around."
F	FERRIS	Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time? You mean after it's too late?
M	Ferris	I wish you'd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump.
M	wisdom	You think he knows? Already?
M	WiSDOM	I haven't made any firm decisions. Maybe we will just keep him tied up.
F	FERRIS	I told you, he doesn't read minds. He sees the results.
M	Wisdom	Tell Baines to meet us there. And bring a dozen men.
M	WISDOM	Wait for my signal, then go in and surround him.
M	WISDOM	I'll do the talking.
M	WISDOM	Cris, this Eric Wisdom. I'm the director of this facility. We're in the middle of a Code Red, and we'd like your help in preventing a major catastrophe.
M	CRIS	I don't believe you.
M	WISDOM (o.s.)	I apologize for the way you've been treated. Agent Ferris got a little carried away. Could I ask you as a favor to please sit in the chair so we can begin?
M	WiSDOM	What's he doing?
M	FeRRIS	Looking ahead.
M	WISDOM	Cris, time is running out.
M	wiSDOM (plasma screen)	We need your cooperation right away.
M	wiSDOM (plasma screen)	Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us? Your ability could save so many lives.
M	wiSDOM (plasma screen)	Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us? Your ability could save so many lives.
F	FERRIS	Don't give him time. Send them in now.
M	WISDOM	Baines, do it.
M	wiSDOM (plasma screen)	Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us? Your ability could save so many lives.
M	wISDOM	What happened? - You idiots!
M	CrIS	Don't make me do what I can do.
M	CRIS	Don't get too attached to your arms and legs.
M	CrIS	Don't.
M	WISDOM	Don't let him out of here alive.
M	baINES	Isolate the building. If there's one exit overlooked, he'll know it.
F	FERRIS	If there's one soft heart, one slow shooter, he'll know it.
M	FeRRIS	Don't worry. I caught him once; I'll catch him again.
M	WISDOM	Be careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
M	Sergeant	You five, up. You five, down. The rest stay with me.
M	WISDOM	No demerol. I need to be alert.
F	FERRIS	Get him a local.
M	amanda	You asked for these as soon as they were ready.
F	FERRIS	Not now.
M	amanda	You might want to check this result.
M	FeRRIS	How pregnant?
M	amanda	A few days.
F	FERRIS	This is getting interesting. We have a mating pair.
M	WISDOM	Secure the female.
M	Cris (o.c.)	Unscrew the vent.
M	SOLDIER	We're here to protect you.
M	Leo	He must be in the walls.
M	SOLDIER	I found him! In here!
M	Cris	Sixteen minutes. VENTILLATION DUCT
M	Baines	He hasn't gotten out through any exit. The bad news is...
M	wisdOM	You've lost him.
M	BAINES	I'm issuing infrared to all my men. We should have a fix in a few minutes.
M	WISDOM	You realize if he gets away now, we'll never get him back. He'll be out there, and he'll be our enemy.
M	FeRRIS	I know how to flush him out.
M	bainES	Fine. Tell me what to do.
F	FERRIS	We don't actually have to do anything. We just have to decide to do something...unthinkable.
M	WISDOM	You want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman?
F	FERRIS	Threats don't count. When he foresees that you actually did kill her, that she's dead... He won't let it happen. - He'll come to us. Surrender. And she'll live.
F	FERRIS	But it only works if we're not bluffing. Because he'll know. The facility is a bee hive of activity. A bee hive that
M	Leo	I've got him. Third level, building C. Pete, Brian, get up there. Kyle, block off the west staircase. Jason, bring your dogs in from the east.
M	Leo	He was on third level seventy seconds ago.
M	BaINES	But where is he now?
M	LEO	He's on this floor!...Shit! He's coming here! He blinded us. And the dogs are useless.
F	FERRIS	He's getting away.
M	WISDOM	Any developments on the Code Red? ...Let me know if there are.
M	WISDOM	Baines, bring the girl friend to the Interrogation Room. I'll deal with her there.
M	BAINES	We're moving her.
M	SOLDIER	Sit there and shut up.
F	FERRIS	You understand what's at stake here? We're playing for the future. Not just what happens next, but what the future is. What the rules are. If one man will know it and control it -- and have power over the rest of us. Or if we'll have power over him.
M	WISDOM	By killing an innocent woman.
F	FERRIS	If you want, I'll pull the trigger.
M	WISDOM	I think that might be...more reliable.
F	FERRIS	I'll join you in a minute. I need to take care of some details.
M	WISDOM	Get more men up here.
F	FERRIS	This is Ferris. I'll need a chopper tanked up and ready.
M	WISDOM	Where the hell did she get the scissors?
M	PATROL LEADER	Hold your fire. We've got the target in plain sight in Corridor 2C, but he's holding a hostage. Agent Ferris. - Request instructions.
M	BAINES	You won't believe this. He's got Ferris.
M	WISDOM	How?
M	BAINES	I don't know, but he's on his way to the front door. They want instructions. Don't shoot.
M	BAINES	Then how are we going to stop him?
M	WISDOM	We don't. We let him go. - It's part of the plan.
M	BAINES	You're sure about this?
M	WISDOM	No, but Ferris is.
M	WISDOM	I hope he loves you as much as I love her.
M	wisdom (o.c.)	Cris Johnson...I've got your girl friend. We know her condition.
M	wisdom (o.c.)	Something very bad will happen at six o'clock unless you're back in custody.
M	CRIS	He hasn't got the balls.
F	FERRIS	We'll find out, won't we?
F	LIZ	You're not going to kill me. That's what the bad guys do.
M	WISDOM	In war, you have to be as ruthless as your enemy.
F	LIZ	Cris isn't the enemy.
M	WISDOM	I didn't mean him.
F	LIZ	Can't you just leave us alone?
F	FERRIS	God, you're remarkable.
F	FERRIS	I wish you had a little more sense of duty. I'd say you have way too much.
M	CRIS	Give me your keys.
M	CRIS	If I see you, I'll kill her.
M	WISDOM	I'm sorry.
F	FERRIS	You know what our problem is?
M	CRIS	"We got off on the wrong foot." It's really...
M	CRIS	"all been a big misunderstanding."
F	FERRIS	Exactly.
M	CRIS	"We've never meant you any harm."
F	FERRIS	It sounds so insincere when you say it.
M	CRIS	I guess you're a better liar than I am.
F	FERRIS	You know what I'm going to say next?
M	CRIS	It'll never happen.
F	FERRIS	My door will be open. We can start from scratch.
F	FERRIS	The magic word is cooperate. That's all we've ever wanted to hear from you.
M	CRIS	When are they going to give up? After you're dead? Cris reacts to what he can't see yet.
M	ferriS	I wish you had a little more sense of duty.
M	CRIS	To a gang of murderers?
F	FERRIS	I see you got our message.
M	CRIS	What's about to happen...you've brought it on yourselves.
M	fERRIS	It's not too late Cris. You can save her.
M	CRIS	I'm planning on it.
M	Soldier	He's heading this way.
M	WiSDOM (o.S.)	Johnson, this is Wisdom. It's 5:55. You have five minutes to turn yourself in... Or your worst nightmare will happen.
M	WisDOM (o.S.)	Look ahead if you don't believe me.
M	CRIS	Get out!
M	feRRIS	It's going off in ten seconds! The situation in Chicago is not quite as severe as in the other nine cities where the dirty bombs exploded, as prevailing winds blew the nuclear waste across Lake Michigan rather than straight into town. Radiation levels in Detroit, on the other hand, may require the entire city to be evacuated.
F	LIZ	This is what they wanted you to prevent?
M	CRIS	I guess...
F	LIZ	And you wouldn't help?
M	CRIS	They didn't explain. They were trying to force me.
M	CrIS	They were gonna make me a slave.
M	CRIS	Liz? Where are you going?
M	Liz	To the doctor.
M	NEAL	She's not coming with us?
M	FeRRIS	Ferris.
M	Cris (o.c.)	This is Cris Johnson.
F	FERRIS	Where did you get this number?
M	CrIS	I want to cooperate.
F	FERRIS	That's music to my ears.
M	CRIS	But I have conditions.
F	FERRIS	I'm sure we can work something out.
M	CRIS	Liz...
M	LiZ	Come back to bed.
M	CRIS	I can't. - I have to go.
F	LIZ	You're not leaving?
M	CRIS	There's something I have to do. Something you'd want me to do. And I can't put it off any longer.
F	LIZ	Fine. Then go. What do I care?
M	CRIS	Liz, it's not like that. I searched for you for a long time. I want to be with you forever.
F	LIZ	Don't overdo it. We just met last night.
M	CRIS	But a lot has happened since then.
F	LIZ	While I was sleeping?
M	CRIS	We're going to have a child.
F	LIZ	Then you really are an angel.
M	CRIS	I don't expect you to believe me. But when you do find out, remember that we came together for a reason. That this wasn't just...one night. It was a special chance for both of us.
F	LIZ	Then why are you running away from me?
M	CRIS	I'm not...I'm taking the long way around.
F	LIZ	I don't understand. We got off to such a great start.
M	CRIS	And I looked for a happy ending... But this was the best I could do.
F	LIZ	See ya?
M	CRIS	I wouldn't be surprised.
M	Ferris	Mr. Johnson, we meet at last.
M	CRIS	I wasn't ready till now.
F	FERRIS	We don't have time to waste. Maybe you could start by telling me how your talent works.
M	CRIS	"The future ain't what it used to be." Ever hear that expression?
M	CRIS (v.O.)	It's a joke, but it's true. The future changes every time you look at it. Because you looked at it. Cause once you see it, you're different. And that changes everything else.
M	FADE OUT
