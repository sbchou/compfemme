M	ANTON/MERCURY	Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up! Step up!... I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of Doctor Parnassus!
M	ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)	Doctor Parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. A secret learned in the mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination. Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... If you dare. But... Beware... there are dangers. You will have to choose. Will your soul fly?... Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? The choice is yours and yours alone. Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.
M	ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)	Or, if you must... ... scour the squalid depths with Putrid's brother, Stench!
M	PERCY	Take a ticket and join the queue! Only five quid a go! There's no greater bargain on planet earth!
M	ANTON/MERCURY	You choose... Fulfilment, grace and light or... Waste, filth and darkness. No prizes for guessing what you'll do.
M	ANTON	No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed. You have to t-take a t-ticket first.
F	MARTIN	Hey you...I wanna audition. I wan... I wanna be a star... I wanna...

M	MR NICK	Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you could use a drink. CONTINUED: (2) 7
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Valentina...
F	VALENTINA	He was chasing me.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You don't go through the mirror.
F	VALENTINA	I had to get away.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You hit him.
F	VALENTINA	Self defence.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You're out of control. Ever since your mother died...
F	VALENTINA	When I was three!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	I don't want to talk about it!
F	VALENTINA	You brought it up! CONTINUED: 8
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	We don't accept drunks!
M	ANTON	We c-couldn't stop him.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	People must be in their right minds when they make the choice.
M	ANTON	I know. I'm s-sorry.
M	DRUNKEN GIRL (V.O.)	Martin!...
M	DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)	Martin!... Martin!...
M	DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)	He went with that cow! I'll scratch her eyes out!
M	FRIEND OF MARTIN	Marty!? Marty, where are you? Oi! Leave off..it's them..they've got our mate back there.
M	POLICEMAN	You! Gunga Din! What do you think you're playing at!?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	`Playing'? We don't `play'! What we do is deadly serious!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Gone. Will we miss him? I don't think so.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	Don't worry if you don't understand it immediately.
M	PERCY	He's doing his bit to save the human race. He thinks it's got a future. Quaint, eh? I keep telling him to get a proper job. Check it out.. another night with nothing in the kitty.
M	POLICEMAN	I want you freaks out of here. Now. If I ever see you in this parish again I'll do you. CONTINUED: 10
M	ANTON	Step up! Step up! For one night only! The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus! Not to be missed!
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	Test your imagination! Envisage the sublime. Let Doctor Parnassus be your guide. Discover the heights of Wisdom...
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	... Or, if you will, visit the doldrums with all that's vile and stinks.
M	PERCY	Take a ticket and wait your turn. Twenty quid a go, reduced to five for one night only!
M	ANTON	The world is full of wonders, beauty, enchantment, for those with eyes to see...
F	LINDA	Mum... Mum... I want to go on the wall of death?
M	MUM	Stop going on, Linda! You're not old enough!
M	DAD	They won't let you, darling.
F	LINDA	But I want to!!! I want to!!!
M	MUM	LINDA!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Excuse me! Excuse me! Would you mind...
F	LINDA	It's not fair.
M	UNCLE BOB	It's the fair, but it's not fair!
M	AUNTY FLO	Ow! Bloody hell!
M	MUM	LINDA! BEEHAVE YOURSELF! I'M WARNING YOU!
M	DAD	Leave her alone!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Please! This is The Imaginarium! It requires respect, concentration... Kindly go elsewhere and take your detritus with you?
M	MUM	Is he insulting us?
M	DAD	Oy!
M	MUM	Diego!? Where's Diego?
M	DAD	DIEGO!?
F	VALENTINA	Pssst!
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	Ladies and Gentlemen, let Dr. Parnassus be your guide... CONTINUED: 11 Beauty, Truth, Wisdom, Justice... without imagination all are dead. DIEGO!!! DIEGO!!! DEGSY!
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)	OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! SHUT UP!
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	AAAHHHH!!! DAMN AND BLAST!!! CONTINUED: 12
M	MR NICK	Come on laddy, cross the bridge! Join up! Be a man. Kill the enemy. Impress your dad. Unlimited ammo. Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow!
M	PIANO TEACHERS	No, no, start again! Again! From the top! Again! Practice! Practice!
M	DIEGO	Help! It doesn't work! It's broken!
M	ANTON	What?
M	DIEGO	The game!
M	ANTON	What g-g-game?
M	DIEGO	The game! The video game! The one we're in!
M	ANTON	I d-d-don't know what you're t-t- talking about.
M	DIEGO	Help me!
M	ANTON	I c-can't.
M	DIEGO	What?
M	ANTON	I'm n-not supposed to be here.
M	DIEGO	What am I going to do?
M	ANTON	That's the p-point. It's up to you.
M	DIEGO	But... Don't leave me! Don't let me die!
M	MR NICK	Attaboy, sonny. Join the men. Nothing to it. Hup two, hup two...
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	No, wait! That's the wrong choice! That bridge leads to failure and despair. You'll be dead before you're thirty. This is the one. This is the bridge to manhood!
M	MUM	He's been kidnapped! They've taken him! It's that weirdo up there! Do something, Dad, do something!
F	LINDA	I want my brother! I want my little brother!
M	INSPECTOR	You cannot perform here without appropriate authorization.
M	INSPECTOR (CONT'D)	It's me. I need some support. We've got trouble.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Ha,ha! Success! One little devil out of the fire... makes it all worthwhile!
M	INSPECTOR	Where did you say you're from? CONTINUED: 13
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I didn't.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	Hooplah!
M	MUM	Diego! Where have you been? I've been worried sick!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	And so... a glimmer of hope... Perhaps eternity has not been in vain!...
M	DAD	And you can wipe that silly expression off your face, you little poof.
F	LINDA	You're in big trouble! You're in big trouble!
M	UNCLE BOB	You've upset your mum.
M	AUNTY FLO	He's spoilt our evening.
M	DAD	And where's your gamer? He's lost his bloody gamer! Another fifty quid down the drain. You're not getting another one! Bloody kids! Why do we bother? CONTINUED: (2) 13
M	POLICEMAN	What's the trouble?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Ah, the fuzz.
M	POLICEMAN	What did you say?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy?
M	INSPECTOR	Next time I find you doing business without a permit I'll impound your wagon.
M	POLICEMAN	I'll be doing worse than that...now, bugger off!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	With pleasure. CONTINUED: 14
F	VALENTINA	Oh! Who's that? Who's there?
M	MR NICK	Hello Parnassus... It's been a while hasn't it?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	He's come to collect.
M	PERCY	I thought so. CONTINUED: 15
M	DR. PARNASSUS	What can I do?...
M	PERCY	Nothing.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	There must be something!
M	PERCY	You're going to have to tell her.
M	ANTON	Look at that moon. I've n-never seen it so b-big. And the stars...It's so c-clear.
M	PERCY	Rain.
M	ANTON	Valentina?
F	VALENTINA	Val... Val.
M	ANTON	I c-c-can't call you Val, P- Parnassus d-doesn't like it. CONTINUED: 16
F	VALENTINA	He's not here is he? He's inside getting pissed.
M	ANTON	Are you happy?
F	VALENTINA	Ecstatic.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	Hey! That's mine! Give it me!
M	ANTON	Would you really be happy in one of those p-places?... N-not me. Well... m-maybe....with you. Let's run away. Make a new life together. I'll retrain. Computers. Stocks and bonds. We could be happy. Just the two of us.
F	VALENTINA	Anton?
M	ANTON	What?
F	VALENTINA	Shut up.
M	ANTON	Why d-do you always have to p- pretend to be so b-brutal?
F	VALENTINA	I'm not pretending. Anyway... I'm under age.
M	ANTON	Valentina.
F	VALENTINA	I shall be twelve on Wednesday.
M	ANTON	Don't be ridiculous.
F	VALENTINA	Percy? How old will I be on Wednesday?
M	PERCY	Twelve.
F	VALENTINA	See? Parnassus says so too. Are you saying he's ridiculous?
M	ANTON	No...
F	VALENTINA	Yes you are. I'll tell him.
M	ANTON	He knows I worship him....
F	VALENTINA	He takes advantage.
M	ANTON	I don't mind. He's extraordinary... Like you.
F	VALENTINA	Puhlease.
M	ANTON	You are.
F	VALENTINA	Parnassus is a pain. Okay he's extraordinary but I'm not. I don't want to be like him. I want to be like other people. Like them. You know... normal. Ordinary. You're so lucky.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	You know what I mean.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	Actually, I'm going to be sixteen. Shall I tell Parnassus I know? I think he knows I know. Silly man. Sweet sixteen.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	The age of consent. CONTINUED: 17
M	VALENTINA O/S	You haven't eaten anything.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Valentina...
F	VALENTINA	I go to all this trouble and you leave it.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I'm not hungry.
F	VALENTINA	Are you ill?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Valentina... my miraculous child.. I have something to tell you.
F	VALENTINA	Now what?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I should never have brought you into this rotten bloody world!
F	VALENTINA	Oh for God's sake!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	What was I thinking of!
F	VALENTINA	Percy liked the soup.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Why does everybody want to live forever?
F	VALENTINA	That's normal isn't it?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Immortality's a curse! Any fool can tell you that!
F	VALENTINA	You know it doesn't agree with you.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Valentina...
F	VALENTINA	And I'll be sixteen on Thursday, so let's not have any more tosh about that.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Listen to me!
F	VALENTINA	You think you're so clever and that everybody else is an idiot! You can't stop me growing up just by lying about my birthday! It's ridiculous!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Shut up! Shut up and listen to me! Listen to me! I need to tell you something, before it's too late! One dark winter's night... Many years ago...?
F	VALENTINA	Is this going to take long? QUIET!
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Many centuries ago, as a matter of fact...
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)	... I was visited... by someone I had hoped never to meet.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	... Having captured the wind and tamed the storm ... the Chief Steward, laying down to take his rest, had a disturbing dream... He dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow-swept plain. A rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world...
M	DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	... The Steward woke and remembered his dream. What manner of man had he dreamt of, and what did it signify?
M	PERCY	... And as the waters rose... the people's need for stories grew. Stories that would feed a great hunger. A hunger for more than just understanding...
M	MR NICK	What exactly do you do here?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	We tell the eternal story.
M	MR NICK	Oh.... What's that?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	The story that sustains the universe. The story without which there is nothing. CONTINUED: 20
M	MR NICK	Nothing? Really. Are you telling me that if you stop telling a story... This story... something you made up, a fiction... that the universe ceases to exist?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	You make it sound so simple.
M	MR NICK	And you believe it?
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	Incredible. It's just incredible to me that you can believe something that can be so easily disproved.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I don't think so.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	No!
M	SUBSTITUTE MONK	..having been brought to the limit of his endurance...
M	THIRD MONK	...yet the forces of evil could not prevail, and...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Stop! CONTINUED: (2) 20
M	MR NICK	There you are. You see. The story's stopped. No more story... And yet, we're still here, the fire's still burning...
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	It's still snowing. The wind's still blowing. Nothing's changed.
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	Cheer up... I've freed you from this ridiculous nonsense.
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	Now you can use your powers to do something else. Have fun, travel, learn a foreign language...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	A sign! A message! That bird was a messenger... from distant places we know not of! Other places! The point is, you're wrong! And I'm wrong! It doesn't have to be us here! Somewhere in the world, at any given time... someone is telling a story! Sustaining the universe! Right now, it's happening. That's why we're still here. You can't stop stories being told somewhere! You can't be everywhere!
M	MR NICK	A weak hypothesis!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Yes?
M	MR NICK	I tell you what... You're probably not a betting man but...
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)	And so I made a wager with the devil.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)	Whichever of us won ten converts first, would win the bet... My argument was the importance of the story, the power of the imagination... His, the power of material things, the supremacy of stuff... Naturally... I won.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O. (CONT'D)	My prize... ... was ever-lasting life. CONTINUED: 21 Everlasting torment... Everlasting... Everlasting... Times changed. No one wanted our tales any longer.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)	It seemed as though the Devil, after all... had triumphed... And then... one day....
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	From the very first moment I saw her, I was head-over-heels in love. She was beautiful, enchanting, delightful, young... But I... I was several thousand years old! How could I woo her? What could I do?
M	PERCY	Don't be a fool! You can't die! You're immortal! You'll just end up broken, in the eternity ward, and I'll be stuck looking after you! Forever!
M	DR. PARNASSUS V.O.	At times like these... the devil is never far away. CONTINUED: 23
M	DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)	The devil granted me mortality again...and youth and great powers. I won my bride. I was in love. But at what price...
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	...at what price....
F	VALENTINA	Father!...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	We've stopped.
F	VALENTINA	What do you mean `at what price'? CONTINUED: 25
M	DR. PARNASSUS	It'll wait, it'll wait. Another time. Something's happened. You'd better go and see.
F	VALENTINA	Typical! You insist I listen to a story and then you don't finish it!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Go and see!
M	ANTON	Incredible! I saw somebody d- dancing in the air.. under the b- bridge..
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	It's true! There was a sh-shadow on the water, when the lightning flashed... CONTINUED: 26
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	You see! The d-dancer!
F	VALENTINA	There's someone hanging there!
M	ANTON	I t-told you!
F	VALENTINA	A rope! Get a rope!
M	ANTON	I c-can't reach him.
F	VALENTINA	Try again!
M	PERCY	Swing in!
F	VALENTINA	Hurry up. CONTINUED: 27
M	ANTON	Arghhh!!!!
F	VALENTINA	You've done it! Brilliant!
M	ANTON	Argggg!!!
M	PERCY	Come on, don't hang about! We're getting soaked up here!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Why are you fishing dead people out of the river? He's dead. Leave him. Let's go. Before the police turn up. CONTINUED: 28
M	ANTON	No! That won't work. And anyway, you d-don't know where he's b-been. Let me...
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	He's alive!
F	VALENTINA	Thank God.
M	PERCY	Well, he was.
M	ANTON	What on earth is this?
F	VALENTINA	Put him in the big trunk.
M	ANTON	B-but...
F	VALENTINA	Don't argue.
M	PERCY	The boss said leave him. CONTINUED: 29
F	VALENTINA	He thought he was dead.
M	ANTON	I d-don't like it. It's none of our b-business.
F	VALENTINA	So, what do you suggest, we leave him on the side of the road?
M	PERCY	Definitely.
M	PERCY (V.O.)	Hey, you!
M	PERCY (CONT'D)	I suppose somebody saves your life everyday of the week. CONTINUED: 30
M	MAN	What?
M	PERCY	Too much like routine to bother with a thank you.
M	MAN	Who are you?
M	PERCY	Percival St. Antoine della Touraine et Sansepolcro da Piemonte the Third. If that proves too difficult, you may call me Percy.
M	MAN	Where are we?
M	PERCY	Geographically, in the Northern Hemisphere. Socially, on the margins. Narratively, with some way to go. And your name is...
M	MAN	I... I can't remember.
M	PERCY	That's handy.
M	PERCY (CONT'D)	Any credit cards?
M	MAN	What?..Oh..OK... you can have whatever you want.. just don't..
M	PERCY	...with your name on them.
M	MAN	Ah...right.. good idea. My wallet... it's gone. Nothing. I've been robbed.
M	PERCY	Don't look at us.
M	CREATURE	What's your name?
M	PERCY	He can't remember.
M	ANTON	Might be for you.
M	PERCY	They'll know who you are.
M	PERCY (CONT'D)	Pity.. I speak Russian.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (O.S.)	Dammit! I told you to leave him. He was dead.
M	PERCY	Well, we didn't and he isn't.
M	ANTON	He was hanging under the b-bridge.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Hanging?
M	PERCY	By his neck. Until dead. If we'd had any sense.
M	ANTON	We found these in his p-pockets.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	The hanged man!
M	VALENTINA(O.S.)	Is he okay?
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	Are you alright?
M	MAN	Yes... thank you.
F	VALENTINA	He tried to kill himself.
M	ANTON	With his hands t-tied behind his b- back?
M	PERCY	Actually, I saw that trick performed many years ago at....
M	ANTON	S-somebody was trying to k-kill him.
F	VALENTINA	My God... that's exciting.
M	ANTON	We c-can't let him stay with us.
F	VALENTINA	Why not?
M	ANTON	We d-don't know what this is about, who he is, what he m-might have done...
M	MAN	I haven't done anything. I'm sure. I hope. Please... Give me the benefit of the doubt.
F	VALENTINA	Father?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	These marks... I recognize them.
M	MAN	Marks?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You've been sent by Mr Nick.
M	MAN	Mr Nick?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Don't toy with me. Tell me you're an emissary from Mr Nick. Tell me you've come with a proposition. Tell me what I want to hear!
M	MAN	Yes.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Thank God! Thank God! Thank God for that!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	He's from Mr Nick.
M	PERCY	No he's not.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	He's come with a proposal.
M	PERCY	No he hasn't.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	All is not lost.
M	PERCY	What proposal?
F	VALENTINA	Father?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You're welcome.
M	MAN	Thank you.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	We can talk here. Sit down, sit down.
M	MAN	Thank you.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	So...
M	MAN	I like your study.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	The message.
M	MAN	The message?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	The message! What's the message? From Mr Nick. What does he want?
M	MAN	Ah... Well... That's the problem...
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Problem? What problem?
M	MAN	Unfortunately... I've lost my memory.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	What!?
M	MAN	It'll come back. I'm sure. CONTINUED: 31
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You've lost your memory?
M	MAN	I just... it needs time... to recover.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You've come here with a message.... A vitally important message from Mister Nick... A matter of life or death... and you can't remember what it is!?
M	MAN	Not at the moment. I'm sorry. It's never happened before.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	BUGGERBUGGERBUGGER!!!!!
F	VALENTINA	He says you must work... to focus your mind. You can help out front.. sell tickets. Ah, here we are... Try this. You can be `Justice'. CONTINUED: 33
M	MAN	Exactly. A laughing stock.
F	VALENTINA	Just like the rest of us.
M	MAN	I think I'll hide behind this.
F	VALENTINA	No face. No name. The mystery thickens. I'm going to have to give you a name...
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	... until you remember who you are, I dub thee Saint George. You can save me from the dragon. George.
M	GEORGE	Hold on!.. what dragon?
F	VALENTINA	You've met Parnassus.
M	GEORGE	Now you are making fun of me.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry but, nobody laughs at me without paying the price....ah,ha.
M	ANTON O/S	We c-can't do it. We...
F	VALENTINA	Hi, Anton.... what?
M	ANTON	The show. We c-can't do it. It's your father...
F	VALENTINA	What is it? What's happened?
F	VALENTINA	Oh no!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Can he remember! Can you remember?
M	GEORGE	Not yet.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Bloody useless! Mr Nick sends an emissary and he can't bloody remember! It's a bloody disaster!
F	VALENTINA	You can't go on. You're drunk.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	I am not drunk! I'm under considerable stress.
F	VALENTINA	
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	No! No understudy! The audience won't tolerate an understudy! There's only one Doctor Parnassus, and I am he! CONTINUED: 34
M	GEORGE	Somebody make some strong coffee.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Strong coffee? Brilliant! This is why fate has brought us together. Don't worry about remembering... It's all the same to a man on a galloping horse!
M	ANTON	For one night only... raise your sights... encounter the majesty, the beauty, the miracle that's in each and every one of you. Take this opportunity to expand your horizons. It's not too late. Experience the Imaginarium of the great Doctor Parnassus.
F	VALENTINA	Where's George?
M	ANTON	P-probably remembered he had a wife or t-two back in Russia.
M	GEORGE	Three tickets for the price of two... That's a fantastic deal. It's a brilliant show. Much better than sex.
M	ANTON	Thank G-God... N-not a single customer!
M	PERCY	Let's close up quick while the going's good.
F	VALENTINA	He's never not done a show before... Maybe he's past it. Maybe it's time to retire.
M	ANTON	Oh n-no! CONTINUED: 37
M	EVELYN	Oh look! How fascinating.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	When does the next show start?
M	PERCY	There isn't a next show.
M	PERCY (CONT'D)	We've done all the shows we're doing here this evening.
M	DEIDRE	But we've got tickets.
M	SYLVIA	This man's drunk. Dead drunk.
M	EVELYN	Disgraceful.
M	VALENTINA O/S	He's not drunk. He's got a bad cold....
M	GEORGE	But being a true professional he tried to keep going, at considerable risk to his health.
M	DEIDRE	We want our money back.
M	GEORGE	No problem...dear ladies. No problem at all. I'm so terribly sorry. I can't apologize enough. You can have your money back or, if you like... an extra free ticket. Better yet, two extra free tickets if you buy another ticket at half price. This offer is only available today.
F	VALENTINA	Wow! You took all that?
M	GEORGE	I got carried away.
M	ANTON	Lying through your t-teeth can do that to you.
F	VALENTINA	Anton!
M	GEORGE	Most of them were coming tomorrow.
M	ANTON	What tomorrow? We're gone. CONTINUED: 39
M	GEORGE	Okay, if it makes you feel better, I'll give it back.
M	ANTON	N-no, keep it. Thanks to you we can afford to buy Valentina a b- birthday cake.
F	VALENTINA	That's enough!
M	GEORGE	Don't be angry with him. He's a little bit jealous. He's young. Insecure. I'll make it my job to boost his confidence.
M	GEORGE (CONT'D)	When's your birthday?
M	MR NICK	You shouldn't drink, it doesn't agree with you. CONTINUED: 41 What do you want? I'll do anything.
M	MR NICK	I know.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You're man's lost his memory! He's bloody hopeless!
M	MR NICK	He's not my man.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	What?
M	MR NICK	Tony Shepherd. Little toe-rag. He used to run a big charity. I wouldn't trust him. But then... you don't trust me do you?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	For God's sake! Tell me what you want!
M	MR NICK	I just thought...seeing you so upset last night...that you needed a glimmer of hope...maybe a little bet?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	On Valentina?
M	MR NICK	No?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You bastard!
M	MR NICK	First to five?... You might win. And save her. What do you have to lose?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I'll kill you! CONTINUED: (2) 41
M	MR NICK	Now that would be something. By her birthday then.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	What! Impossible!..you've seen the business we're doing.
M	MR NICK	Things are going to pick up. As sure as eggs is eggs.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Wait!
M	PERCY	Five souls.. two days, eh!?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Shh! I'm trying to think.
M	PERCY	I told you didn't I?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	What?
M	PERCY	That he was a wrong-un. CONTINUED: 42
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Trust in providence, Percy. Remember the hanging man. The cards don't lie.
M	PERCY	No... but they sure as hell like being economical with the truth.
F	VALENTINA	Don't talk to me.
M	ANTON	P-please...I'm sorry about last night. I behaved like an idiot.
F	VALENTINA	Yes.
M	ANTON	You must admit... even idiots have their qualities.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	George... We'd like to know who you really are.
M	GEORGE	What?... Yes. Me too.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	I may be able to help.
M	GEORGE	Really? What?... How...? CONTINUED: (2) 42
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Hold this piece of wire.
M	PERCY	You won't feel a thing.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	I'm going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	I want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing.
M	GEORGE	That's not difficult... in my condition.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Hold your breath.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	Very good, very good. Yes... Yes, I see... I see... Very interesting.
M	PERCY	You may breathe normally.
M	GEORGE	What... ?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Alas, this technique has its limitations.
M	GEORGE	But... Did you discover anything?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Your name.
M	GEORGE	My name?... What is it?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Anthony Shepherd.
M	TONY	My God! That's it! You're right! Anthony Shepherd! They call me Tony. Tony Shepherd! That's who I am!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	And... you used to do good works. Something to do with charity I think.
M	TONY	Yes...That's right! That's right! But how?...
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	It's an ancient technique of mental divination, but I'm very rusty and it doesn't always work satisfactorily.
M	TONY	But that's amazing! Brilliant! Was there anything else?
M	TONY (CONT'D)	That's absolutely fantastic! Thank you. Perhaps I'll remember other things.
F	VALENTINA	Charity work? I knew you were a good person.
M	PERCY	So what was he doing dangling under a bridge from his neck?
F	VALENTINA	Percy!
M	PERCY	Oh dear, was that a rude question? Have I put my foot in it?
M	TONY	That's so strange. And horrible.. it's a complete blank. But I do remember I was involved in some sort of charity.. trying to do good, to make the world a better place, you know...inspire people, give them hope.... What an arrogant idiot.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	What's that?
M	ANTON	Mozart's flute concerto in G.
M	TONY	I mean, the pipe. Where did you get it?
M	ANTON	I found it.
M	TONY	It's mine.
M	ANTON	Oh. You're a musician n-now.
M	TONY	It's not a musical instrument. May I have it?... Please.
M	ANTON	Are you s-sure it's yours?
M	TONY	Positive.
M	ANTON	Alright. It's g-gone.
M	TONY	Don't fool around.
M	ANTON	Ah, there it is.
M	TONY	Give it to me!
M	ANTON	Oooooh!
F	VALENTINA	Anton, that's enough.
M	TONY	Thank you.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	What's eating Anton?
M	PERCY	He's in love with Valentina?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	In love....?
M	PERCY	It happens.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	The little snake! I'll skin him alive!
M	PERCY	While you're at it, don't forget the other one.
M	PERCY (CONT'D)	The viper, the scorpion, the amnesiac boa constrictor. Tony.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Quite another kettle of fish.
M	PERCY	Really?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	He's ambitious, energetic... a man of destiny. CONTINUED: 43
M	PERCY	And he's going to help us win five souls.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I think he might. Valentina sees good in him.
M	PERCY	She'd be better off with Anton.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Perhaps I should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls.
M	PERCY	That's even worse than the other ideas you've had today.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	You're not wrong... Ah, Percy, what would I do without you?
M	PERCY	Get a midget.
M	ANTON	Sleep no more. Procrastinate no longer. Embrace this once in a life- time opportunity. Let the mind of Doctor Parnassus be the portal to the infinite world of your imagination. CONTINUED: 44 What are you doing? Please concentrate. We've got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight. A great deal depends on it.
M	ANTON	As old as the universe itself, the great Doctor, versed in every mystic practice known to man, and many more besides, will guide you to your destiny.
F	SALLY	What?... Hey, what you doing?
M	ANTON	T-taking you to the heart of your imagination!
F	SALLY	Oh my god! No way!
M	ANTON	You won't regret it! CONTINUED: (2) 44
M	FEMALE FRIEND	Go for it Sal!
F	SALLY	Only if she comes with me.
M	FEMALE FRIEND	Now you're talking!
M	ANTON	N-not at the same time!
F	SALLY	I'm not going on my own.
M	ANTON	Your imagination is a very special place. Doctor Parnassus will make it flower.
F	SALLY	I bet he will.
M	FEMALE FRIEND	We'll do it together.
M	ANTON	No. T-two c-competing imaginations in the Imaginarium at the same time... it's n-not advisable.
M	FEMALE FRIEND	Eh?
M	ANTON	The stronger imagination will overcome the weaker and then there's n-no knowing what might happen. CONTINUED: (3) 44
M	FEMALE FRIEND	That's really stupid.
F	SALLY	Let go!
M	ANTON	D-don't be afraid, d-dear lady. You'll be safe with me.
F	SALLY	Put me down!
M	ANTON	Have no fear.
M	FEMALE FRIEND	She doesn't want to do it on her own!
M	ANTON	Only b-because she d-doesn't realize...
M	FEMALE FRIEND	Let go of her you silly pillock!
F	VALENTINA	Anton...
M	ANTON	It's alright! It's alright! CONTINUED: (4) 44
M	FEMALE FRIEND	SALLY! They've got her in there! That's her screaming! SAL! They doing something to her! SALLY! Help, somebody! Help! Save her!
F	VALENTINA	Father! Father!
M	TONY	Please. Everything's alright. It's okay. Really. I promise you.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen....please...
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Ugh! CONTINUED: 46
M	VOICE IN CROWD	Somebody call the police!
F	VALENTINA	What were you thinking? Look what you've done. Get out of the way! Tony. CONTINUED: 48
M	PERCY	Better luck next time.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	This is my punishment. All is lost. First to Five. One down. Impossible, Valentina. First to five. One down. No people. No time, Valentina. We are doomed.
F	VALENTINA	Ssshhhh... Thanks, Tony. Leave us.
M	PERCY	Do me a favour. Take a long walk off a short pier.
M	TONY	Can I help?
M	PERCY	Bugger off!
M	ANTON	L-leave me alone.
M	TONY	What were you doing to that girl behind the mirror? CONTINUED: 50
M	ANTON	What are you suggesting?
M	TONY	Oh, c'mon...we all heard her screaming.
M	ANTON	I was screaming as well. It was t- terrifying...
M	TONY	Terrifying? Why? I don't understand.
M	ANTON	No, well...you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you?
M	TONY	Your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real?
M	ANTON	You think it's some k-kind of scam, d-don't you?
M	TONY	Isn't it?
M	ANTON	No... But I d-don't expect you to g- get it... N-not in a million years.
M	TONY	Hang on.. if he can really control people's minds, why isn't he ruling the world? Why bother with this crappy side show?
M	ANTON	He d-doesn't want to rule the world d-does he?... He wants the world to rule itself!
M	TONY	What a waste... Tell me about the mirror. What's the point of that, if not to razzle-dazzle the public?
M	ANTON	You're way off the mark. It's a b-bloody great mystery... wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag enema...or do I mean, enigma...
M	TONY	Er... one more thing....Does `first to five' mean anything to you?
M	ANTON	I thought you were the c-clever one.
F	VALENTINA	Thank God it's only cuts and bruises. I thought we'd lost you. CONTINUED: 52 If you hadn't been there...
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Valentina, your father seems in a terrible state. Is it the police? The show? Maybe I can help.
F	VALENTINA	I don't know what's wrong with him, but if it's about the show...I don't care. I'm tired of it...let the police arrest us. I'm sick of living like this....
M	TONY	Don't say that. What you're doing is important. Really important. It's just... maybe... it should be done in a different way.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S	What sort of "different" way do you suggest?
M	TONY	Oh, hello, good morning sir. How are you feeling? That was a nasty bump on the head you got..
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S	"Different?"
M	TONY	Well, sir, I've been thinking... It's clear the show's not attracting many people. Forgive me but... I see two ways of tackling this problem. Either the style of the show is at fault... or the type of audience. I would suggest changing both.
M	PERCY	Change the show!? Who the fizzing hell do you think you are?......
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Shhh!
M	TONY	I'm sorry but.. you're not modern. People want modern. Look.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	This is modern. It works. Trust me, I understand this world. This kind of mind control. Let's try to meet the public halfway.. the right public.. and in a better part of town.
M	PERCY	What about the filth?
M	TONY	What?
M	PERCY	The filth. The police.
M	TONY	There'll be a better class of police too.
M	PERCY	That'll be the day.
M	TONY	The trick is not to hide. Change your colours. Be bold. Go where they would least expect to find you. I think we have been brought together for a reason. I don't believe in coincidence. You saved my life. Now let me do something in return.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Our time's nearly up... This could be what we need.
M	TONY	This can be my birthday gift to Valentina.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Well then... For God's sake let's do it!!!
M	PERCY	Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we do?
M	TONY	Well... First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Anton! Where are you going?
F	VALENTINA	What are you doing? Didn't you do enough damage last night? Anton... I'm the one who wants to run away! Are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what? Please. We need you.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	How much money have you got? CONTINUED: 53
M	TONY	Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we can't accept this.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	We are here to give...not take. We are here to help those in need. If it's money you need, then here it is. If it's the flowering of the soul you need, then here we are but, unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment. But thank you.. I can see you have a generous spirit.
M	WOMAN	Excuse me but, how does this work? What does it cost?
M	TONY	Cost? Money is no good in the Imaginarium. This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. A place for souls to be purified.
M	WOMAN 2	How long does that take? I'm running late.
M	TONY	Madam, why should you care about time? What are your dreams worth in minutes?
M	TONY (CONT'D)	There are hard choices to be made in life. What about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world. Do you have time for their dreams? Or are you like I once was...do you just despair? Despair at all that is wrong in the world.. ...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...I despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that I took the easy way out...the coward's way...I committed suicide! Yes, that's right, I killed myself. Can you understand my despair? But I was saved...saved by a miracle...The Imaginarium...and Doctor Parnassus. He brought me back from the dead. He gave me a new life. A reason to live. He has given me power to dream again... to dream of a better world.
M	VOICES IN CROWD	Stop pushing!/Excuse me, can one make a booking?/Are you taking bookings?/Stop pushing at the back!/Form a queue!
M	TONY	Please, I'm sorry but, we're booked solid at the moment.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	Is that child up for adoption?
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)	I want to adopt that unfortunate black child. It shouldn't be working like this. It should be in school.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)	Who's in charge here?
M	TONY	Madam, congratulations, you have been chosen.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	What?
M	TONY	Come forward and enter the Imaginarium.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	But, I haven't paid.
M	TONY	We don't want your money. We want your hopes and dreams. You may make a donation later, if you wish.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	But...
M	TONY	This is a rare moment. Very few are chosen. Don't miss this once-in-a- life-time opportunity. This way. Please.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Believe me Madam, you're the luckiest woman in the world.
M	POLICEMAN	Alright, I think it's time to move on, folks.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	Oh... how gorgeous... CONTINUED: 54
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)	Ohhh... What bliss... and I don't even know your name...
M	TONY	Tony...
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	Tony. How dashing.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)	Oh, goodness me!
M	TONY	If I'm not wrong, I fear you must go alone.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	Why would I want to go without you darling?
M	TONY	It's one of the rules... One imagination at a time, free from the influence of another.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	Boring. CONTINUED: (2) 54
M	TONY	Oh..look... another possibility..
M	TONY (CONT'D)	You must make a choice...and... actually, to be honest, I'd strongly recommend this one.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	But... Rudolph Valentino, James Dean, Princess Di?... all these people... they're dead.
M	TONY	Exactly. To be reborn, first you must die. All of them have achieved a kind of immortality. And we love them all the more for it. They won't get old or fat. They won't get sick or feeble. They are beyond fear. They are forever young. They are gods. And you can join them.
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	You're such a wonderful speaker.
M	TONY	There's not a moment to lose. But your sacrifice must be pure. You have to let go of all these worldly goods.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Remember nothing is permanent... not even death.
M	TONY	That was so... I had no idea... It's just... incredible. ..how do you do this?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Hooplah! CONTINUED: 55
M	LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN	Thank you, thank you, that was so beautiful, I feel so... thank you so much...
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me strength to continue
M	DR. PARNASSUS	One more to go and we're free.
M	VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN) SUBTITLED	C'mon..What are you watching that crap for.
M	SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)	It's him! Who are you talking about? Impossible.
M	SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)	I'm sure.
M	VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)	Where did he go? You tell me... It can't be him. He's dead. We killed him.
M	SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)	So why did he run? CONTINUED: 56 There he is!!
M	SALES-GIRL	Hi! Hello! Today's special! Reach for the clouds! Discover your true potential! Gift certificates are available at...
M	GREGOR	Relax...smell the flowers. CONTINUED: (2) 56
M	SERGE	You thieving scumbag! We break every bone in your body!
M	TONY	No! Wait! I can explain! Give me a chance!
M	VLADIMIR	We want our money or you die again! This time for good!
M	ANTON	Stop it! L-leave him alone! CONTINUED: (3) 56
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	Stand b-back! I'm warning you!
M	GREGOR	Relax. Smell the flowers.
M	RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN)	Mama! Mama! Help! Save us!
M	TONY	Did you see me!! I almost reached the clouds! I could have...it was incredible...I was almost there...
M	ANTON	Shut up!
M	TONY	I made my choice and I climbed... I felt so much potential. I could have done anything. I have to have another chance...another go...I
M	PERCY O/S	Maybe you were holding them upside down.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	What? CONTINUED: 57
M	PERCY	That cards! The bloody Tarot cards!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S	Enough, Percy! Enough!
M	TONY O/S	I made a mistake. A big mistake. I know that and I'm sorry.
M	ANTON	You're a l-liar. You've been lying to us all along. Who are you? Who were those thugs?
M	TONY	I am not a liar!
M	ANTON	No?
M	TONY	No! I just... didn't divulge everything I knew.
M	PERCY	Comes to the same thing.
M	TONY	Absolutely not. Not in law.
M	ANTON	You stole their money.
M	TONY	No. I didn't.
M	ANTON	That's what they said. CONTINUED: 58
M	TONY	Are you going to believe them before you believe me?
M	PERCY	Why not?
M	TONY	Because they're irredeemably bad people, and I'm essentially good. I know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous, but I'm trying to be honest. Look, the truth is... in order to get my charity off the ground I needed capital.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Yes, I know, and you're right, but that's the way the grown-up..the real world works. You can't make omelettes without soiling your hands. Or should that be the other way round? Anyway, I - with hindsight very foolishly - accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere. There was absolutely no way I could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money. I made a mistake. And I have to live with that. I'm sorry. What more can I say?
F	VALENTINA	Oh Tony.
M	TONY	But, can we not talk about me for a moment.. I want to thank the Doctor for letting me experience the most sublime, inspiring ....
M	ANTON	So why were they trying to k-kill you? "Again!" is what they said.
M	TONY	What?
M	ANTON	The first time they hung you from the b-bridge... right?... B-because you stole their money.
M	TONY	Stop saying that! I didn't steal it! I didn't have it. I'd had to invest in infrastructure. I needed more time. When you run a charity you have to give lots of money away. You wouldn't believe the red tape. The Charity Commission are a bunch of fascists. It's incredible. I mean... c'mon give me a break...I almost died today.. and I said I'm sorry... and anyway..... this was supposed to be a special day...it's Valentina's birthday.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Happy birthday. For a beautiful woman.
M	ANTON	The marks on your face...
M	TONY	Marks?
M	ANTON	They scrawled something on your forehead. Symbols... Signs... CONTINUED: (3) 58
M	PERCY	You had some of those when we rescued you.
M	ANTON	Yes, what's that about?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	No! Leave it!
F	VALENTINA	Who is it?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	It's too late... for visitors.
M	PERCY	Please can we answer the door? I can't stand not answering the door, or the telephone, or whatever. It's not in my nature. I won't sleep for weeks if we don't answer the door! Sorry! Sorry, I just... I've got a thing about...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I know... It's over....you've won...
M	MR NICK	Four rotten Russkies?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	And the girl..from the pub.
M	MR NICK	Sally doesn't count. Do you, gal?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	You're joking... toying with me. Like a cat with a mouse... As is your privilege.
M	MR NICK	Sal didn't get to make a real choice. You were gaga. Out for the count. Wouldn't be fair...And you've got four, thanks to your friend Tony. So... we're even... it's not quite over.
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	Not quite. Oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11. CONTINUED: 59
M	VALENTINA (V.O.)	Father?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Valentina... my darling girl. We must do another show! Now! Quickly! Get ready to move out!
F	VALENTINA	Who was that?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Somebody asking the way. Where's Tony?
F	VALENTINA	I overheard you... He wasn't asking the way.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Please! Get everybody together. Another show! Tony! Percy!
F	VALENTINA	I want to know what's going on.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Not now.
F	VALENTINA	Yes, now! I want to know the truth!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	The truth?
F	VALENTINA	What are you hiding?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	There are more important things, at this moment!
F	VALENTINA	It's something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found Tony isn't it?
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Yes.
F	VALENTINA	So tell me.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	What I told you was... the truth. I really am thousands of years old. I have been immortal. I have been mortal. And I have had many dealings with the devil. Too many.
F	VALENTINA	What are you saying?...
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Remember the woman I was telling you about?.. the one I was so desperately in love with.. so in love that I made a deal with the devil? That was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so...
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	... so young. She was everything I had ever dreamed of. I made a choice. I bargained away my immortality. I regained my youth... and I won her. I did! I won her...!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	...but at a price...
F	VALENTINA	What price?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	It's too terrible...
F	VALENTINA	Tell me...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I... The price of my obsession... I can't say it.
F	VALENTINA	Say it.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	You.
F	VALENTINA	What?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I was mortal again... on condition that... any children I fathered... would, on their sixteenth birthday... belong to him.
F	VALENTINA	Him?... But... didn't...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Your mother never knew. She died before I had to tell her.
F	VALENTINA	I don't believe this! It can't be true. It's just another of your wretched stories... A cruel story!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	If only...
F	VALENTINA	Why do you say these things?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	It's true. Every word. But all is not lost.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	A new wager... The first of five. If I win... you're free... you're mine again.. and we can win! Where's Tony? We can still win!
F	VALENTINA	By playing games with the devil!?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	With one more show. The day isn't over.
F	VALENTINA	No!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Valentina.
F	VALENTINA	All my life you've made me play `Beauty', `Truth', `Justice'... filled my head with dreams and high ideals. All that crap! While... all the time...! The devil was right! You're arrogant! Vain and arrogant! I'm just another one of your stupid wagers!... You're beneath contempt.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Valentina! That's not true! It's not like that! Wait! Come back! Valentina!
M	ANTON	What's happened?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Valentina... She's... she's gone...
M	PERCY	Telling the truth... Always a bad idea.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	You fool! You monstrous fool! You should be dead.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	What are you doing? CONTINUED: 62
M	TONY	Saving Valentina.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	What?... How?
M	TONY	I overheard you. You only need one more to win. Me! I'll be that one. I'll take the risk to save Valentina and, hopefully, you sir. We've still got a few minutes.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Yes! Yes! Of course! Of course! Thank God! Thank God!
M	TONY	How about thanking me?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	What?
M	TONY	I expect nothing in return.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	No. You're a saint... A saint.
M	TONY	Only Valentina's hand in marriage, if she'll have me...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Oh, my head...
M	TONY	And, as your son-in-law... perhaps... initiation into the secrets of the trance.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	No! I can't do it!
M	TONY	But... Why not?! What's wrong?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	My mind... I can't concentrate... I'm too upset...
M	TONY	You must do it! You have to do it! It's the only way to save your daughter!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I know...
M	TONY	Concentrate. You must concentrate. I'll make the right choice. I'm sure of it. I can feel how right it is already. Oh God!... Doctor... We can save her.. you and me. I need this. We both need this. Please. The trance.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Bugger!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	It's no good! CONTINUED: (3) 62
M	TONY	PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!... Sir. Concentrate...or you'll have lost her forever.
M	VALENTINA O/S	Tony...oh, Tony..
F	VALENTINA	It's useless... Hopeless... I thought I was strong, but I don't even know how to run away...
M	TONY	It's alright... it's alright... Don't cry. It's going to be alright, believe me.
F	VALENTINA	This stupid theatre...!... That's all I've ever known...! I've always believed it was something precious, but it's not... it's a lie...I hate it!
M	TONY	Everything's going to be alright... I'll take you away. I'll show you the world. My world. The great big beautiful world I've always dreamed of... You'll love it. Yes?
F	VALENTINA	Maybe.
M	TONY	C'mon then.
M	ANTON	Ah, there you are, Tony. Here's something m-might interest you. 'Missing: D-disgraced head of children's charity'.
M	TONY	No!
M	ANTON	N-not a bad p-picture, Tony. Listen to this Valentina... it's about Tony's b-beautiful world..
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S	Valentina! Where are you?
M	ANTON	...Anthony Shepherd, who was arrested last week on charges of...
M	TONY	Valentina, Don't listen to that. I'm innocent. This is the work of people who are trying to destroy me! Evil people! Believe me! Look, I'll show you the truth! CONTINUED: (5) 62 Hurry!
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS	Valentina! Forgive me.
M	TONY	This isn't right. This is all wrong. Which way?
M	VALET	Your car is here, Mr.Tony.
M	TONY	Ah, Lester, just in time.
F	VALENTINA	No! Tony, don't get in! Get away! CONTINUED: 63
M	TONY	Help! Over here!
M	BOATMAN	Give me your hand
M	TONY	Stop! What are you doing! We'll drown!
F	VALENTINA	No we won't. This is the way.
M	ANTON	Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on. Not with him! He's all lies.
F	VALENTINA	Just like my father. Leave me alone. I don't care anymore. I want a new life.
M	TONY	Valentina...
F	VALENTINA	Tony, help me, she's heavy.
M	TONY	What is it now?! Can't we just go inside and get dry.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Ostanobuite bas menshi schit!
F	VALENTINA	You did it! You made the right choice! CONTINUED: 64
M	TONY	Sustainability's great, if you can achieve it. The problem is, in many cases you simply can't, for a whole variety of reasons.
M	JOURNALIST	Aren't you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it?
M	TONY	Look, charity, like poor little Olga... ...is always with us, to coin a phrase... Ah, there you are, my lovely.
M	JOURNALIST	And what's your message to the Prime Minister?
M	TONY	I wouldn't presume to have a 'message' for the Prime Minister... Fortunately for the Foundation, I think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things. CONTINUED: (2) 64
M	TONY	You look gorgeous, my love. I knew you wouldn't let me down.
M	TONY (CONT'D)	This is a vitally important moment for the future of the Foundation. The children of the world are depending on us. CONTINUED: 67 Valentina!
F	VALENTINA	Anton!? All of this is false! It's nothing to do with you! It's all him. It's his imagination!
M	TONY	Call security, somebody.
M	ANTON (V.O.)	It's all rotten! A naked lie! You've got to understand!
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	Look at this...
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	...`Tony Liar'..
M	TONY	What? How?...
M	ANTON	'The disgraced director of the children's charity "Suffer the Little Children, who was arrested last..
M	TONY	Stop him. Silence the little bastard!
M	ANTON	...who was arrested last week on charges of involvement in the sale of organs from third world children to wealthy Westerners'...unghh!
M	TONY	And now he doesn't stutter! You see!? It was all an act to get cheap sympathy!
F	VALENTINA	Take your hands off him!! Stop it!
M	TONY	Get off me! What are you doing? You've betrayed me! Haven't you? You let him in...into my world, you bitch!?.. after all I've lavished on you...OW!!
M	CHILDREN'S CHOIR	"We are the world..we are the children..."
M	GUESTS	My God! Somebody stop him! He's a monster! Get him! CONTINUED: 68
F	VALENTINA	Anton!!!
M	ANTON	Valentina!..help me. Please.
F	VALENTINA	Forgive me, Anton. I was wrong.
M	ANTON	I know... I'm not a child.
M	ANTON (CONT'D)	I love you, Valentina.
F	VALENTINA	Noooo!
M	TONY	Who's behind this!? Eh!? You didn't come up with this all on your own did you!!!??? No! Someone's got at you. Someone's paid you!!!... Who!!!??? Tell me!!!
M	DR. PARNASSUS(O.S.)	Valentina! My darling daughter! There you are! CONTINUED: (2) 68
M	TONY	You old bastard! This is all your doing!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	All my doing?... I'm merely the facilititatater, dear boy.
M	GUESTS (O.S.)	There he is! Stop him! Leave her alone. Get him!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I create the opportunities. Is it my fault if your not up to it?
F	VALENTINA	Father! No!
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	NO..NO NO... Please.. father..it's all my fault. What have I done?...
M	PARAMEDIC	P-p-p-lease m-mis-s, there's-s n-n-othing y-y-y-you c-can d-d-o, he-he-he's d-d-dead... NOOOOO...!!!
M	PARAMEDIC	...d-dead drunk.
F	VALENTINA	You little fool! You're to blame!.. for everything... I hate you!
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	So this is to be my choice!!
M	MR NICK	Now, there's absolutely no need for that. That's just plain contrariness. You think you deserve punishment but you're a kid - you have no idea...trust me.
F	VALENTINA	Wrong. I'm 16...I'm a woman now..
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	...a selfish bitch, everyone I love dies...I'm...
M	MR NICK	...only fit for hell? If only. No... your pop would never speak to me again. And that'd be a shame. Let's dance.
M	DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S	Valentina!!!!!!
M	MR NICK	Damn!... I've won.
M	MR NICK	Funny how things work out, isn't it? It's not what I had in mind y'know... this.. Valentina, being the fifth... It doesn't seem right... She's supposed to be the prize, the star prize... not part of the bloody score... And you lumbered with eternal life all over again... What a bummer, eh?
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	I hope they get that bastard. Tear him limb from limb... But they won't... He leads a charmed life, that one... I've been trying to nail him for years... I thought I had him this time. But, there's always some prat comes to his rescue... Talk about the luck of the Devil. Those weird markings you found on him... on his forehead... Those satanic-symbol, so-called, things... What's all that about?... Maybe they protect him in some way... I've never been into that black-magic stuff myself... Can't seem to get the hang of it... I know, pathetic isn't it?... CONTINUED: 69
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	God, I hate to see you like this. Look, I tell you what... If you can get the lowdown on those satanic markings, or.. wait.. better still, if you can wipe that self- righteous little creep off the face of the universe... I'll give you Valentina back.
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	How about it?
M	TONY	Thank God for that! CONTINUED: 70
M	TONY (CONT'D)	Give me that!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Give us a moment, please.
M	DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	Here's your tube... Here's mine. But mine's just a cheap counterfeit... Look, it breaks... But here's another...
M	TONY	Stop!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	You're not amused?
M	TONY	You've been talking to the devil, haven't you? Let me guess what he said... If you manage to kill me, he'll release Valentina. Yes? Am I right?... I am aren't I? It's all lies. He can't release her. And why not? Because he doesn't have her. He can't have her because she's the prize. He doesn't have five wins. But if you kill me he will, won't he? You'll have lost Valentina forever!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Choose.
M	TONY	This is ridiculous!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Choose!
M	TONY	You've got to believe me! For all our sakes! Are you sure you made the right choice?
M	TONY	Look...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Let's find out.
M	TONY	Gotcha! CONTINUED: (3) 70
M	DR. PARNASSUS	There are three cardinal rules. One, there's no black-magic, only cheap tricks. And... er... I forget the others. Now, where's my daughter?
M	MR NICK	How should I know? You're her father. Her loving father.
M	MR NICK (CONT'D)	She's free... isn't she?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	What else could I do, Valentina? What else could I have done... What other choice could I have made?... Damn!... It was the right choice... Of course it was... Of course... But where are you? Where's my beautiful daughter? Where's my darling? How long must I suffer?
M	DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)	No, no, no... No more choices, please... No more choices...!!!
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Hey!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Percy!
M	PERCY	About bloody time!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Where have you been?
M	PERCY	Here!
M	DR. PARNASSUS	How long have you been here?
M	PERCY	How long's a piece of string? Don't ask daft questions.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Thank God I found you. I need your advice. I've got a problematical choice to make.
M	PERCY	Problematical my arse! Come on... I know it's against the grain...
M	DR. PARNASSUS	No! Suburban bungalows and all that they evoke are anathema to me. Dammit Percy! Stop! I've got my pride!
M	PERCY	Yeah, it goes just before the fall. Come on... I know it's against the grain... CONTINUED: 72
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Valentina...?
F	VALENTINA	Father...? Where have you been?... All these years... I thought you were dead.
M	DR. PARNASSUS	So did I. But you... I...
F	VALENTINA	Come in.
M	PERCY	So far, so good.
M	KID'S VOICE (V.O.)	Mummy? Can I have some ice-cream?
M	KID	Mummy?
F	VALENTINA	Billy, this is your grandad. Say hello to your grandad. I think he looks a little like you.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	He's only five. And he's very shy. Would you like some tea? CONTINUED: 73
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	Okay, you look after Imogen.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	She's eight months, and, so far, fortunately, doesn't look in the least like you.
M	VALENTINA (CONT'D)	This is all I ever wanted... I know it's not what you wanted for me, but...well... there you go... I'm happy.
M	ANTON	Hello Doctor.
F	VALENTINA	We're both happy.
M	VOICE OF TOY CHARACTER (V.O.)	It's your choice. You can stay here and look after mum and dad, or come with me and help fight the giant.
M	SECOND TOY CHARACTER (V.O.)	I'll have to think about it. CONTINUED: 74
M	DR. PARNASSUS	Beautifully made. It'll last for years if properly looked after.
M	NINE YEAR OLD SON	Does it come with a happy ending?
M	DR. PARNASSUS	I'm afraid we can't guarantee that.
