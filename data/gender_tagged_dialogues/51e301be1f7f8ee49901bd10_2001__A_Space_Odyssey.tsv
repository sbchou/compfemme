Despite and excellent and continually improving safety record there are certain risks inherent in space travel and an extremely high cost of pay load. Because of this it is necessary for the Space Carrier to advise you that it cannot be responsible for the return of your body to Earth should you become deceased on the Moon or en route to the Moon. However, it wishes to advise you that insurance covering this contingency is available in the Main Lounge. Thank you. You are cleared through Voice Print Identification.

M	SMYSLOV	Are you quite sure?
F	FLOYD	Yes, really, thank you very much.
F	ELENA	Well... How's your lovely wife?
F	FLOYD	She's wonderful.

F	ELENA	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
F	FLOYD	How is gregor?
F	ELENA	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
F	FLOYD	Well, where are all of you off to?
F	ELENA	Actually, we're on our way back from the moon. We've just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko. And what about you?
F	FLOYD	Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
M	SMYSLOV	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
F	FLOYD	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
M	RUSSIANS	
F	FLOYD	Is there any particular reason why you ask?
M	SMYSLOV	I hope that you don't think I'm too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what's been going on up there.
F	FLOYD	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
M	SMYSLOV	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
F	FLOYD	Really?
M	SMYSLOV	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
F	FLOYD	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
M	SMYSLOV	Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
F	FLOYD	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
M	SMYSLOV	That's right.
F	FLOYD	I see.
F	ELENA	Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius.
F	FLOYD	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
F	ELENA	Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
F	FLOYD	Well, that does sound very odd.
M	SMYSLOV	Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
F	FLOYD	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
M	SMYSLOV	Fortunately, they did.
F	FLOYD	Well, I'm glad about that. GLANCES. ONE OF WOMEN OFFERS A PILL BOX. TAKE ONE AND THIRD RUSSIAN
M	SMYSLOV	Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
F	FLOYD	Certainly.
M	SMYSLOV	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
F	FLOYD	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
M	SMYSLOV	This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
F	FLOYD	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
F	ELENA	Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
F	FLOYD	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
F	ELENA	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
F	FLOYD	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
F	ELENA	Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.

M	CO-PILOT	Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
M	PILOT	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
M	CO-PILOT	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
M	PILOT	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.

M	PILOT	Well, if there is anything that you wnat, just give a holler.
F	FLOYD	Thank you.
M	PILOT	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
F	FLOYD	What do you mean?
M	PILOT	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
F	FLOYD	I see.
M	PILOT	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
F	FLOYD	I'm afraid that's out of my depart- ment, Captain.
M	PILOT	Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
F	FLOYD	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
M	PILOT	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
F	FLOYD	I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but as I've said, I don't think there's any cause for alarm.
M	PILOT	Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
F	FLOYD	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.

M	HALVORSEN	Dr. Floyd. We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible. "U" SHAPED TABLE THREE PROJECTION SEATED AROUND TABLE ARE TWENTY BASE PERSONNEL.
M	HALVORSEN	Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd. TO FRONT OF ROOM.
F	FLOYD	First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science. Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base. I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth. with your negative views. I have been personally embarrassed by this cover story. But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will.
M	It should not be difficult for all	of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning.
F	FLOYD	This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions?
M	MICHAELS	Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
F	FLOYD	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.

F	FLOYD	Can we go down there closer to it?
M	HALVORSEN	Certainly. RAMP Does your geology on it still check out?
M	MICHAELS	Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
F	FLOYD	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
M	MICHAELS	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
F	FLOYD	Any clue as to what it is?
M	MICHAELS	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
M	MICHAELS	might do something, but we don't want to be too rough until we know a little more.
F	FLOYD	But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
M	MICHAELS	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
M	HALVORSEN	The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth.
M	HALVORSEN	Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind.
F	FLOYD	Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose?
M	HALVORSEN	I suppose we'll never know.
M	MICHAELS	The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys.
F	FLOYD	Any ideas about the colour?
M	MICHAELS	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
F	FLOYD	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
M	MICHAELS	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that? SEE A NUMBER OF DISPLAYS SEVERAL TV OF FLOYD AND IN THE

M	NARRATOR	A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids.
M	NARRATOR	Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children.
M	NARRATOR	All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its crystalline memory.
M	NARRATOR	But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past.
M	NARRATOR	It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years.
M	NARRATOR	All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat. 00.10 B26 00.20 00.15 B27 00.05 00.35 B38 02.15 14 MONTHS LATER FROM EARTH.

M	BOWMAN	Sure, what is it?
F	POOLE	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
M	BOWMAN	What's up?
F	POOLE	It's about my salary cheques.
M	BOWMAN	Yes?
F	POOLE	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
M	BOWMAN	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
F	POOLE	That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
M	BOWMAN	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
F	POOLE	Really.
M	BOWMAN	Yes.
F	POOLE	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
M	BOWMAN	Did they have any explanation for this?
F	POOLE	Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
M	BOWMAN	It's possible.
F	POOLE	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
M	BOWMAN	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
F	POOLE	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
M	BOWMAN	No. I never did, either.
F	POOLE	We spent so little time with them, I have trouble keeping their names straight.
M	BOWMAN	I suppose the idea was specialized training.
F	POOLE	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
M	BOWMAN	Oh?
F	POOLE	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
M	BOWMAN	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
F	POOLE	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
M	BOWMAN	Well, what is it?
F	POOLE	I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
M	BOWMAN	That seems very unlikely.
F	POOLE	Yes, I thought so.
M	BOWMAN	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
F	POOLE	How?
M	BOWMAN	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
F	POOLE	That's true.
M	BOWMAN	if you want to, why don't you?
M	WALKS TO THE	
F	POOLE	Hal... Dave and I believe that there's something about the mission that we weren't told. Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. We'd like to know whether this is true.
M	HAL	I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
M	BOWMAN	He's got a point.
F	POOLE	Okay, then how do we re-phrase the question?
M	BOWMAN	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
F	POOLE	Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
M	BOWMAN	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
F	POOLE	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
M	BOWMAN	But not completely inconceivable?
F	POOLE	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
M	BOWMAN	I guess it isn't.
F	POOLE	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
M	BOWMAN	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
F	POOLE	Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
M	HAL	I will if I can, Frank.
F	POOLE	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
M	HAL	True.
F	POOLE	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
M	HAL	That's true. At the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. Is this true?
M	HAL	That's true.
F	POOLE	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
M	HAL	That's true
F	POOLE	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
M	HAL	That's true.
F	POOLE	Thank you very much, Hal.

M	If the computer should turn out	to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers.
M	It has almost always revolved	around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer's performance in other areas.

M	HAL	Yes, I know.
M	BOWMAN	You probably also know that we found them okay.
M	HAL	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
M	BOWMAN	Well, that's just not the case, Hal. They are perfectly all right. We tested them under one hundred per cent overload.
M	HAL	I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
M	BOWMAN	Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
M	HAL	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
M	BOWMAN	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
M	HAL	I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error.
M	BOWMAN	I know all about your service record, Hal, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that you're right now.

M	BOWMAN	Yes, well I understand you view on this now, Hal.

M	HAL	I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
M	BOWMAN	The antenna has to be replaced.
M	HAL	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
M	BOWMAN	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
M	HAL	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
M	BOWMAN	Well, in any event, give me the manual hibernation control.
M	HAL	If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
M	BOWMAN	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
M	HAL	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
M	BOWMAN	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
M	HAL	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
M	BOWMAN	I don't feel like resting. Give me the control, Hal.
M	HAL	I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
M	BOWMAN	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
M	HAL	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
M	BOWMAN	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
M	HAL	If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict.
M	BOWMAN	I am prepared to do that anyway.
M	HAL	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
M	BOWMAN	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.

(pause) And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer. I'll pu him on...
M	SIMONSON	Hello, Dave. I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer.
M	We believe it all started about two	months ago when you and Frank interrogated the computer about the Mission. c119 You may have forgotten it, but we've been running through all the monitor tapes. Do you remember this?
M	POOLE'S VOICE	The purpose of this mission is no continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets. Is this true?
M	HAL'S VOICE	That is true.
M	SIMONSON	Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying. He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we'll explain later.
M	The true purpose of the Mission	was to have been explained to you by Mission Commander Kaminsky, on his revival. Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission, but he couldn't tell you the truth when you challenged him. Under orders from earth he was forced to lie.
M	In everything except this he had	the usual reinforced truth program- ming.
M	We believe his truth programming	and the instructions to lie, gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict, and facedc with this dilemman, he developed, for want of a better description, neurotic symptoms. these symptoms would centre on the communication link with Earth, for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program- ming.
M	Following this lin of thought, we	suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection. Since he became operational, he had never known unconsciousness. It must have seemed the equivalent to death. c121 At this point, he, presumably, took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors.
M	If I cane speak in human terms,	I don't think we can blame him too much. We have ordered him to disobey his conscience. speculative, but we think it is a possible explanation. Anyway, good luck on the rest of the Mission and I'm giving you back to Bernard.
M	MISSION CONTROL	Hello, Dave. Now, I'm going to play for you a pre-taped briefing which had been stored in Hal's memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com- mmander Kaminsky, when he, had been revived. The briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here it is...
F	FLOYD	Good day, gentlemen. When you see this briefing, I presume you will be nearing your destination, Saturn. I hope that you've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you.
M	Thirteen months before the launch	date of your Saturn mission, on April 12th, 2001, the first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered.
M	It was found buried at a depth of	fifteen metres in the crater Tycho. No news of this was ever announced, and the event had been kept secret since then, for reasons which I will later explain. emitted a powerful blast of radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise. proved harmless.
M	Perhaps you can imagine our	astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn. A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device.
M	Burying it could only shield it	from the sun, since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable.
M	We finally concluded that the only	reason you might bury a sun- powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself. What is its purpose? I wish we knew. The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes.
M	We've examined dozens of theories,	but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm.
M	What the purpose of the alarm is,	why they wish to have the alarm, whether the alarm represents any danger to us? These are questions no one can answer. The intentions of an alien world, at least four million years older than we are, cannot be reliably predicted. and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation.
M	Discussion took place at the	highest levels between govern- ments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary.
M	This is, of course, why security	has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need-to-know basis. a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event.

M	But when they looked out across	the deeps of space, they felt awe and wonder - and loneliness.

M	When they had learned all they	could, they began to modify.
M	They tinkered with the destiny	of many species on land and in the ocean, but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years.
M	They were patient, but they were	not yet immortal. There was much to do in this Universe of a hundred billion stars. So they set forth once more across the abyss, knowing that they would never come this way again.
M	Nor was there any need. Their	wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest. On Earth, the glaciers came and went, while above them, the changeless Moon still carried its secret.
M	With a yet slower rhythm than	the Polar ice, the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy.
M	Strange and beautiful and terrible	empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to their successors.
M	Earth was not forgotten, but it was	one of a million silent worlds, a few of which would ever speak.
M	Then the first explorers of Earth,	recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies, passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created, and who now trnscended them in every way.
M	NARRATOR	For a few thousand years, they shared their Universe with their machine children; then, realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done, they passed into history without regret.
M	Not one of them ever looked through	his own eyes upon the planet Earth again.
M	But even the age of the Machine	Entities passed swiftly. In their ceaseless experimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light. They could become creatures of radiation, free at last from the tyranny of matter. galaxy, and beyond the reach of time.
M	They could rove at will among the	stars, and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space. But despite their God-like powers, they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago.

M	Soon, these gave way to more	complex signals at many frequen- cies, ultra-violet, infra-red, X-rays.
M	The machine made no reply. It	had nothing to say.
M	Then it saw the first robot	probe, which descended and hovered above the chasm. Then, it dropped into darkness.
