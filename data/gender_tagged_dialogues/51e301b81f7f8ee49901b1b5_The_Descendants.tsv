M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MATT (V.O.)	My missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the Hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in Christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing. They made business deals along the way -- buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. Now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. Hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction.
M	MATT (V.O.)	My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawai'i, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation -- we're all just out here drinking mai- tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they nuts? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a surfboard in fifteen years. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	MATT (V.O.)	For the last 23 days, I've been living in a "paradise" of IVs and urine bags and endotracheal tubes and six-month- old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise can go fuck itself.
M	MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)	This is Elizabeth King, my wife. Twenty-three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned. Now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma. Liz is very competitive. Whatever she does, she does to the fullest.
M	NEUROLOGIST	She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner, but occasionally her responses are specific, though inconsistent. Her reflexes are primitive and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented... It was exactly what Elizabeth used to accuse me of.
M	MATT (V.O.)	Twenty-three days in a coma, and any day now the doctors will give me their final verdict if she's going to come out of it or not. Then I have a decision to make. Wait, that's wrong. Liz has a living will. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft Like always, she makes her own decisions. But I know she's going to pull through. Hi, Noe, what's up? Matt, you have a call from Scottie's teacher. She says it's urgent.
F	MATT	Yeah, sure. Put her on.
M	A SCRAPBOOK	shows PHOTOS OF ELIZABETH lying in her hospital bed. The
M	MS. HAYASHI	We just don't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates. Some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents.
F	MATT	Yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing, but I had no idea --
M	MS. HAYASHI	I can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but Scottie just hasn't been herself. Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time.
F	MATT	Home. See, I would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her -- you know, keep her occupied. I wouldn't really know how to... The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft I mean, I've kind of got my hands full. And her sister's away at school on the Big Island. I don't think Scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children.
M	MRS. THULL	Mr. King, we see this every day -- children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. And your family is facing a devastating crisis. Have you been engaging Scottie in really talking about what's going on? Encouraging her to express her feelings? That's crucial.
F	MATT	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. This shit is bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s. This shit is bananas. EARBUDS in place and in her own world, DANCING just outside This shit is bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s!
M	MS. HAYASHI	Scottie, that is not a good choice! Are you making a good choice?
F	MATT	Yeah, Scottie, come on. Knock it off. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	What's the matter with you? Showing those pictures of Mom for your art project?
F	SCOTTIE	I'm a photographer, Dad, a real photographer.
F	MATT	No, you're not. You're overdoing it is what you're doing.
F	SCOTTIE	I saw it in a book. Some famous photographer lady took pictures of her mom in the hospital while she was dying, and they're considered art. That's what I'm doing.
F	MATT	First of all, your mother's very sick, but she's not dying. Second, you don't share personal stuff like that with strangers. What's going on with Mom is private.
F	SCOTTIE	I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?
F	MATT	No.
F	SCOTTIE	Can we get smoothies?
F	MATT	No.
M	MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)	The last time I took care of Scottie by myself was when she was one. Now she's ten, and I have no idea what goes on inside her head. She's insane. And with Elizabeth in the hospital, I think she's testing me. I'm the backup parent. The understudy. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	I wish you'd stop doing that. And rather than taking her picture all the time, you should talk to her. I'm tired of asking you. You heard Dr. Johnston -- people in a coma can hear you -- you know, well, some of them can. It lets them know they're still loved, might even help them wake up sooner. And it'll help you express whatever feelings and emotions you're supposed to be going through -- you know, make you feel better.
F	SCOTTIE	I don't know what to say.
F	MATT	Tell her a story.
F	SCOTTIE	I don't have a story.
F	MATT	Tell her anything. Tell her what's been going on in school.
F	SCOTTIE	She never cares about that.
F	MATT	I don't believe that. What about after school? She's always driving you around the island. You know, gymnastics? Soccer?
F	SCOTTIE	I don't do those things anymore.
F	MATT	Ballet? Piano? Hula?
F	SCOTTIE	Nope.
F	MATT	If you're not going to say anything to your mother, we might as well leave. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	Okay. Let's go.
F	MATT	How about this? Write her a letter.
F	SCOTTIE	What would I write?
F	MATT	I don't know. "Get well. Wake up. I love you. Don't leave me alone with my idiot Dad."
F	SCOTTIE	How's she going to read it? She's in a coma.
F	MATT	Goddammit, Scottie, stop fighting me on everything.
F	SCOTTIE	But it doesn't make any sense.
F	MATT	You know what your mother is hearing right now? You refusing to talk to her. Is that what you want?
F	SCOTTIE	I'm starving. And I'm thirsty. I want a soda.
F	MATT	We're not leaving until you talk to her. I'll even give you privacy. Recite her the alphabet for all I care. What do you want to drink?
F	SCOTTIE	Sprite.
F	MATT	OK, Sprite. Diet Sprite?
F	SCOTTIE	Not diet. Regular. Do you think I'm fat? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	No, you're not fat.
F	SCOTTIE	I'm not the model.
F	MATT	It's just that all that sugar makes you cranky.
F	SCOTTIE	I'm not cranky!
F	MATT	Okay. I'll be right back. Talk.
M	NURSE JOY	Mr. King, how are you?
F	MATT	Fine, Joy, fine. And you?
M	NURSE JOY	I see your picture in the paper today. Have you made your decision yet?
F	MATT	My decision?
M	NURSE JOY	Your family. About your big land.
M	NURSE JOY (CONT'D)	What? Me and Mr. King, we're like this.
F	MATT	Well, it's not really my decision. It's my whole family's decision. And furthermore... ... mind your own business, young lady. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s. My cousins and I meet in six days to approve a buyer. Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards. Why does so much have to depend on me -- my wife, my daughters, my family's land? I just want to hide.
M	SHOPKEEPER	Hey, they all the same cards. You like buy all the same cards?
F	MATT	These are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop. This girl is underage. Why do you sell postcards like this? This is a hospital. These aren't get-well cards.
M	SHOPKEEPER	You like buy all the cards? Or you want I put them back?
F	MATT	Never mind. Yes, I'm buying them. And these two sodas. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SHOPKEEPER	Okay, you buy underage girl all for yourself.
M	MATT (V.O.)	Elizabeth's going to make it out okay. I know it. It's not her time yet. She'll wake up, Scottie and Alexandra will have their mother back, and we'll talk about our marriage. I'll sell the land and quit my practice and buy her whatever she wants -- a big boat, a house in France, a trip around the world, just the two of us. We'll get close again, like the early days. It's still in us. It must be.
F	MATT	Scottie, what are you doing?
F	SCOTTIE	I'm hungry. Can we go?
F	MATT	You didn't talk to her, did you?
F	SCOTTIE	Yes, I did.
F	MATT	What did you tell her?
F	SCOTTIE	It's private. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	You're lying. And Jesus Christ, enough with the goddamn texting! Give me that phone! Give it here!
M	MATT (CONT'D)	Jesus, Scottie. Okay, you win. Let's go.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	At least say goodbye.
F	SCOTTIE	Bye, Mom!
M	MATT (V.O.)	My wife -- the sportswoman, the model, the drinker.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	Would you please wake up already? I need you. I can't do this alone. Is this Barb Higgins?
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	Yes, it is.
M	MATT (O.S.)	Hi, Matt King returning your call. I assume your daughter is a classmate of my daughter's. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	Yes, Lani is a classmate of Scottie's, yes.
F	MATT	How can I help you? Let's see, where to start? It's Scottie. She's been texting some awful things to Lani, and I'd like her to stop.
F	MATT	For instance.
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	Here's the latest one. "We all know you grew pubes over the summer." She sends little messages like that for no reason. She even wrote it on Lani's Facebook wall.
F	MATT	Huh.
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	She calls my daughter Lanikai, implying she's like the size of an entire neighborhood. Do you think that's nice?
F	MATT	That's not like her at all. She's usually very sweet.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	As you may know, her mother isn't well, and maybe this is how she's dealing with it.
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	I don't care about the backstory, Mr. King. My daughter comes home from school in tears. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Yeah, no, I get it. I'm very sorry.
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	Scottie should be the one who's sorry. I want her to come over and apologize to Lani, and I don't ever want her to write to my daughter again.
M	LANI (DISTANT O.S.)	She can in a good way.
M	BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)	If she doesn't apologize, I'm going to tell the headmaster. You can't buy your way out of this.
M	MATT (V.O.)	See what I mean? Everybody sees me as the rich guy, the inheritor. People resent us. I resent us. Even our last name -- King. How irritating.
F	MATT	You need to say you're sorry, and you need to mean it. No dicking around. I have a ton of work to do tonight. Do you have any idea how behind I am? You made her cry. Why would you want to be so mean to someone?
F	SCOTTIE	I don't know!
F	MATT	Is that what you text all the time, nasty things?
F	SCOTTIE	No.
F	MATT	Well, what then? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	I write them with Reina. They make her laugh, and then she shows Megan and Brooke, and they laugh too.
F	MATT	I should have known Reina had something to do with it. I don't want you hanging out with her.
F	SCOTTIE	Wait, I told Reina she could visit me in the hospital since I'm not in school anymore. Can she?
F	MATT	We'll make a deal. You apologize to this girl, and you talk to your mother, and then we'll see about Reina dropping by the hospital. Okay?
F	SCOTTIE	Dorks! walking on the sidewalk with KAYAKS, wearing T-SHIRTS reading Dorks!
F	MATT	Scottie, knock it off!
F	SCOTTIE	Her house is down there on the corner.
F	MATT	You've been here before? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	Yea-uh. She invites me to her birthday, like, every year.
F	MATT	So you guys are actually friends?
F	SCOTTIE	Until last year's party, when she locked me out of the house and I had to sit outside all day while everybody was inside. She thought she was so great, but then I became friends with Reina and Brooke and got popular.
F	MATT	What?
M	BARB HIGGINS	Thank you for coming by.
M	BARB HIGGINS	I forgot to mention the time Scottie said she didn't want to be Lani's partner at the rock wall because she didn't want to fall into my daughter's butt crack. That doesn't even make sense.
F	MATT	Scottie, do you have something you want to say to Lani?
F	SCOTTIE	Sorry. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	LANI	It's okay.
F	MATT	Great. Well, nice meeting you both. Lani, you should come over sometime. Come for a swim or a hike or something.
M	BARB HIGGINS	Scottie, the things you said were simply evil. Do you realize that? I don't know what's led you to be such a nasty young lady.
F	MATT	Hey, hey. We came over. She apologized. We're dealing with it. Kids are mean sometimes. They grow out of it. It's a kid thing. Here, Scottie, you're going to stop, right? And you're really, really sorry, right?
M	BARB HIGGINS	I don't think she's sorry at all. She's going to keep doing it. I can tell.
F	MATT	No, she won't. It's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at her birthday party and Scottie sat outside by herself. It was a mean thing to do, but Lani here probably did it just to show off, right?
M	MATT (CONT'D)	But I'm not about to declare that one action defines a human being's entire character. She's a work in progress, and like all complex people is a bundle of contradictions.
M	BARB HIGGINS	I didn't know about that.
F	SCOTTIE	You brought me cake. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	You brought her cake. So, I don't know, maybe Lani should be the one to apologize, since this incident may have been the catalyst for all this... "evil" was the word you used.
M	BARB HIGGINS	Oh, and Mr. King?
F	MATT	Yes?
M	BARB HIGGINS	Good luck with the sale.
M	BARB HIGGINS (CONT'D)	They say your decision will have a major impact on Hawai'i's real estate world, not to mention the whole landscape of Kaua'i. Hundreds of millions of dollars, yeah?
F	MATT	Big decision.
M	BARB HIGGINS	My husband's family is from Kaua'i. Hanapepe, born and bred. They hope you don't sell.
F	MATT	You don't say.
M	BARB HIGGINS	All the traffic it's going to make.
F	MATT	Are you going to act different with Lani? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	I'll try, but it's hard. She has a face you just want to hit.
F	MATT	Yeah.
M	MATT (V.O.)	My great-great-grandmother was Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani, one of the last direct descendants of King Kamehameha. She was originally supposed to marry her hanai brother, but she fell in love with her haole banker and estate manager, Edward King, whose parents were missionaries. Between his land deals and her huge inheritance, all of their descendants for generations have watched the past unfurl millions into our laps through leases and sales. Now the Rule Against Perpetuities is forcing us to dissolve the trust, and we're selling the last parcel of undeveloped land. Soon my daughters and I can just be normal citizens like everybody else, and these dead people will stop controlling our lives.
M	MATT (V O.) (CONT'D)	I just want to be a normal guy. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	MATT (V.O.)	Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't touched my share of the trust money. Like my father before me, I live only on the income from my law practice. I don't want my daughters growing up entitled and spoiled. And I agree with my father -- you give your children enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing.
F	NOE	Mr. King, your cousins are here.
M	MATT (V.O.)	Not only am I the sole but I'm a commercial real estate and transactional attorney, so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal, Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa, Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen.
M	MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)	The proposals are virtually the same -- hotels, shopping centers, condos and golf courses. 3000 new jobs in the first five years. Support letters from the construction industry and unions. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft A Chicago group is offering half a billion dollars, but we're leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named Don Holitzer. He's actually from Kaua'i and made a fortune in Silicon Valley. Cousin Hugh is pushing us in that direction, and I say why not?
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Bad news, Matt. Dr. Chun, Dr. Mueller and I -- we believe her condition, * which we call a multi-factorial anoxic * encephalopathy, is deteriorating. We * see no eye movement, no pupillary * response, basically no brainstem * reflexes whatsoever. The machines * could keep her going, but her quality * of life would be... very poor. * Basically what you see now. She'll never be like she was, Matt. Never. * We know that now.
M	DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D)	I can't tell you how sorry I am to have to tell you this. And you have your daughters. There's just nothing we can do.
F	MATT	So... if we do go ahead and take her off the machines --
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Not if, Matt. When. I have a legal obligation. You know that. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	How long will she last?
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Hard to say. Could be a few days. Could be two weeks. But for planning purposes, you should work off the shortest possible scenario. I know I need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away.
M	DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D)	Elizabeth has so many friends, a big life. Last time I was at your house, must have been 200 people. If you're going to let people know to say goodbye, which is fairly typical protocol in these situations, start now. By the time the last day comes, they feel more ready, as ready as they can feel. I'm so sorry, Matt.
F	MATT	What're you doing?
F	KAI	Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and I just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. I know she'll grill me.
M	MARK	And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	KAI	Well, I don't want to have to start from scratch later. Oh, and Matt, on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge, all ready to nuke.
M	MARK	So what's the latest anyway, Matt? Any updates?
F	MATT	No, no. Just more of the same -- monitoring the swelling, keeping her * kidneys and other vitals working, you * know, hoping for the best.
F	SCOTTIE	I'm hungry!
F	MATT	What else is new? Let's get you something to eat. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	The food here at the club is so good.
F	MATT	Yeah, they do a good job here.
F	SCOTTIE	Why is it called a jellyfish? It's not a fish, and it's not jelly.
F	MATT	No idea. You ask good questions. You're getting too smart for me, Scottie.
F	SCOTTIE	I'm going to find out. Then I'm going to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if she knows. Do you think she's going to know everything she used to know?
M	TROY	Hi, Matt. Hi, Scottie.
F	MATT	Troy.
M	TROY	I'll catch up to you guys in a second.
M	TROY (CONT'D)	So, uh, what's going on? I mean, how's Elizabeth doing?
F	MATT	Same.
M	TROY	I visited her last week, you know. I thought she looked pretty good.
F	MATT	So why'd you ask? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	TROY	I don't know, I just wanted to know the latest. I'm praying for her every day, you guys. Really hard. Seriously. So what I was saying was, when I was there, I talked to her, and her hand moved, so I was pretty encouraged. I thought that was an encouraging sign.
F	MATT	That's enough.
M	TROY	I really think she heard me.
F	MATT	Look, Troy, go to your friends. No hard feelings. Let's just leave it alone.
M	TROY	I told you, Matt, there were lots of chops and holes that day. I told you a hundred times. Ask anybody. What happened to her could have happened to me. It was a super-hard day on the water.
F	MATT	You weren't supposed to be driving, Troy. She was supposed to be driving.
M	TROY	She wanted me to drive. And she's the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn. And just your whole attitude toward me, Matt -- I mean, I feel terrible. I wish it were me and not her. Plus I almost drowned myself when we capsized. And my rotator cuff is never going to be the same, and I'm going to miss Moloka'i.
F	SCOTTIE	Just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, Troy. Mom twitches at weird times. When you cut off a chicken's head, it runs all around, but it's still a dead chicken. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Hey, sport, don't pay any attention to that guy. That guy's a dope.
F	SCOTTIE	I hate him.
F	MATT	Yeah.
F	SCOTTIE	I didn't mean to say dead chicken. I don't want Mom to die.
F	MATT	I know, I know. Hey, let's get out of here. Let's go do something crazy. Like let's drive to the airport and hop over to the Big Island and surprise your sister. What do you say?
F	SCOTTIE	Right now?
F	MATT	It'll be fun. She's not expecting us or anything. And we bring her home. I think she should be here with us, don't you? Don't you miss her? I miss her.
F	SCOTTIE	Yeah, I'm out of school. She should be too! The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft Somehow it feels natural to find a daughter of mine on a different island. A family seems exactly like an archipelago -- all part of the same geographic expression but still islands -- separate and alone, always drifting slowly apart.
F	MATT	Hi, sorry to bother you. I'm Matt King.
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	Yes, hello, Mr. King.
F	MATT	I've come to pick up my daughter, Alexandra.
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	Did you call Administration?
F	MATT	No, I didn't. It's sort of an emergency. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	All right, let's see what we can do.
F	SCOTTIE	Which door? Which door is it?
F	MATT	Scottie, keep it down!
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	Will you both keep it down? It's around the corner.
M	DORM SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)	That's the wrong door.
M	DORM SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)	Go back to sleep, Yuki.
F	MATT	Sorry, Yuki.
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	Wake your roommate, sweetie.
M	ROOMMATE	Um... Alex isn't here.
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	Where is she?
M	ROOMMATE	I think she's... outside somewhere. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	Girls! What do you think you're doing out here?
M	EMILY	Run!
F	SCOTTIE	Hi, Alex! It's me, Scottie!
F	MATT	You know, I pay $25,000 year for this crap not to happen. Alex!
F	ALEXANDRA	Dad? My fucking dad is here!
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	You don't talk like that here. This is unacceptable behavior!
F	ALEXANDRA	What's up, Dad?
M	EMILY	You come out to play a few holes with us?
F	SCOTTIE	We came to get you so you can come home. He took me out of school already. I haven't gone for three whole days. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	What's happening? Why are you here?
F	MATT	You need to come home and see Mom.
F	ALEXANDRA	Fuck Mom!
M	DORM SUPERVISOR	What did I say about the language? What is it about me that makes women in my life want to destroy themselves? Elizabeth with her motorcycles and speedboats and alcoholism.
M	MATT (V.O.)	Alexandra with her drugs and older guys and modeling.
M	MATT (V.O.)	And Scottie, how can I protect her from... me? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	I don't like eggs.
F	MATT	Why didn't you say so before I made them?
F	SCOTTIE	I thought they were for you.
F	MATT	Good morning. Does Mom let you have Coke for breakfast?
F	ALEXANDRA	I'm pretty sure it's after eleven.
F	MATT	How are you feeling?
M	MATT (CONT'D)	Hungover, huh? Why am I not surprised? I don't know where to start, and we probably shouldn't in front of Scottie.
F	SCOTTIE	I don't mind.
F	MATT	I thought you were supposed to be getting your act together.
F	ALEXANDRA	I have gotten my act together. I was just drinking. I've been doing really well, but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better, and how I was in that stupid play you guys didn't bother to see. Do you even remember the name of it? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	That's what I thought. So what if I got drunk on the ONE night you happened to drop in? So the fuck what?
F	MATT	Hey, hey, hey. Watch your language in front of Scottie.
F	SCOTTIE	I'm okay.
F	MATT	Anyway, it's good to see you. Welcome home. Want some eggs?
F	ALEXANDRA	How long do I have to stay?
F	MATT	We'll discuss that.
F	ALEXANDRA	I'm going swimming.
F	MATT	Then I'll join you.
F	ALEXANDRA	Good times.
F	ALEXANDRA	I gotta go. I'll see you later. The pool's really dirty. What day does the pool guy come?
F	MATT	He comes... you know, I don't know what day he comes. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Awesome.
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	Sid's coming over.
F	MATT	Who's Sid?
F	ALEXANDRA	A really good friend from Punahou. We were in school together for years.
F	MATT	Oh. Okay.
F	ALEXANDRA	He wants to be there for me with all this shit happening.
F	MATT	Do I know his parents?
F	ALEXANDRA	No. He might stay over too. Is that cool?
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	What the fuck? Get out of my underwear, you freak.
F	SCOTTIE	Ooo, la la! Don't I look divine?
F	MATT	Scottie, get back inside and change into your swimsuit.
F	SCOTTIE	Why?
F	MATT	Now. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Real good job you're doing.
F	MATT	That's part of why I brought you here. You have to help me. I don't know what to do with her.
F	ALEXANDRA	Maybe if you spent more time with her, she wouldn't act like such a complete spaz. Get her out of town -- go camp on Kaua'i. That's what mom did with me whenever I was losing it.
F	MATT	Listen, Alex, your mother isn't well.
F	ALEXANDRA	Obviously.
F	MATT	They just told me she isn't going to wake up. It's for sure now. The doctors are going to stop caring for her. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your mom wanted it this way.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	She has a will, see, saying we have to do it like this. We both do. That's why I got you. We're letting her go. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Why'd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool?
F	MATT	Alex... Alex...
F	ALEXANDRA	What do you want?
F	MATT	I just found out yesterday. We have to go through this thing together, you and Scottie and I. And I need to go around and tell people what's happening -- our family and close friends. Sometimes I'll want you to come with me. Other times I need you to watch Scottie.
F	ALEXANDRA	You want me to go around with you and tell everyone that Mom's going to die? What's the point of that? Breaking the news, watching them cry, dealing with their emotions. How depressing is that going to be? Just call them.
F	MATT	Alex, nobody wants to do any of this. But we need to tell Grandpa and Tutu, a few friends. They have the right to know and to be able to say goodbye.
F	ALEXANDRA	I don't want to talk about Mom with anyone.
F	MATT	Whatever you fought about with her at Christmas, you need to drop it. Grow up. You love your mother. Your mother loves you. Move on. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	I can't drop it.
F	MATT	You have to.
F	ALEXANDRA	You really don't have a clue, do you? Dad, she was cheating on you. That's what we fought about. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with some guy. It made me sick to see her near you. I went back to school thinking that was it, I was done with her. I was going to call and tell you everything. But then the accident happened, and I was waiting until she woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't even suspect. Right? That disgusted me too. You're always so busy.
F	MATT	Caught her with some guy? What does that mean?
F	ALEXANDRA	Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house. His house, I guess.
F	MATT	Just a guy? It could have been anybody.
F	ALEXANDRA	He had his hand on her ass. It was gross.
F	MATT	You're sure it was her. Then what? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Then nothing. She went into the house. A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing.
F	MATT	And?
F	ALEXANDRA	First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.
F	MATT	Who is he?
F	ALEXANDRA	I don't know. Some guy.
F	MATT	What did he look like?
F	ALEXANDRA	Dark hair.
F	MATT	Watch Scottie. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Hello! It's me, Matt!
F	KAI	Oh, hey, Matt.
F	MATT	You guys weren't sleeping, were you?
F	KAI	No, we were just fighting. Come on in. Want a drink? Want some coffee?
F	MATT	What were you fighting about?
M	MARK	Stupid.
F	KAI	It's not stupid. He wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? Me.
M	MARK	It's work that's totally unnecessary. You don't have to do anything. Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. It's more fun that way, anyway. You know what? We can talk about it later. Matt didn't come over to hear us squabble.
F	KAI	Shit, Matt. Is Elizabeth -- is there any news? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	In fact there is. I'll tell you in a moment. Who is he? Does she love him? Who is he?
F	KAI	Matt.
F	MATT	I'm sorry to put you in this position. But I'm not really the one who put you there, am I? I just want to know who this guy is that my wife has been... seeing.
F	KAI	Oh, Matt, you're angry.
F	MATT	You could be a therapist. Very keen powers of observation.
F	KAI	Wow. I think we should talk another time. I think you need to cool it.
F	MATT	Is it Troy? That fucking Neanderthal?
M	MARK	You don't know him.
F	KAI	Oh, don't you even, Mark. Shame on you. You're her friend.
M	MARK	I'm Matt's friend too. And this is a very unique and dramatic situation. I'd want to know.
F	KAI	Don't betray her when she can't even defend herself. Matt, you may not be able to hear this right now, but it's not her fault. Women have needs.
F	MATT	Are you fucking kidding me? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	KAI	Your marriage was not... You worked so hard to make partner, and no one can take that away from you. But then you made partner, and you only got busier. And it's not like you were so involved with the girls. She was lonely.
F	MATT	So you're going to talk to me in clichés about women? Nothing is ever a woman's fault. Was it still going on when she had the accident?
M	MARK	But I stayed out of it, Matt. Anytime Kai talked about it, I walked away.
F	MATT	And you what? You probably egged her on. Add some drama to your life without any actual risk. Whom do you think you're protecting anyway? She doesn't need your protection -- it's over. She's going to die.
F	KAI	Don't say that.
F	MATT	I almost told you yesterday. She's never going to wake up. It's for sure now. You hear me? We're pulling the plug. You were putting lipstick on a corpse.
M	MARK	Come on, Matt. That's a little intense.
F	MATT	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take it out on you guys. I just... Does she love him? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	KAI	How can you ask about him when she's going to die? Who cares? Yes, she loves him, loved him, whatever. She's crazy about him. She was going to ask you for a divorce.
F	MATT	You still haven't told me who he is. I guess it doesn't matter.
M	MARK	Brian Speer. His name is Brian Speer. Two e's.
F	SCOTTIE	Hi, Daddy.
F	ALEXANDRA	Dad, this is Sid.
F	MATT	Hello, Sid. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SID	`Sup, bro?
F	MATT	Don't ever do that to me again. Get ready, okay? We're going to Grandma and Grandpa's. Auntie Esther will come over to watch you.
F	ALEXANDRA	Sid's coming with us, okay?
F	MATT	Sid, this week, what's going on, is a real family matter. You understand. Sid's not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents. He'll be bored stiff.
F	ALEXANDRA	Dad, I told you he was going to be with me. I'll be a lot more civil with him around.
M	SID	What can I say?
F	MATT	Does he know what we're doing?
F	ALEXANDRA	He knows everything.
M	SID	Dude, your wife is dying and then you find out she's been stepping out on you? That's harsh.
F	MATT	Get in the car. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SCOTT THORSON	This is like reading Korean.
F	MATT	Scott, I'll be happy to walk you through it.
M	SCOTT THORSON	Jibber-jabber.
F	MATT	It's an advanced directive -- basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or, in this case, does not want. No prolonged mechanical ventilation, no --
M	SCOTT THORSON	I know goddamn well what it says. Says she doesn't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk. Says if the doctors can't do squat, she'd just as soon get on with it.
F	ALEXANDRA	Gramps, are you okay?
M	SCOTT THORSON	Elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here. Always a thoughtful girl. A strong girl. A hell of a lot stronger than her brother. Barry whines his way through life. Might even be a homosexual, for all I know.
F	MATT	Yeah, Scott, I don't think so. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SCOTT THORSON	And she's stronger than you, Matt. She lived more in a year than you did in a decade, sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash. All that money you refuse to use -- what the hell good is it? And now you and your family are cashing in your chips -- what the hell for? Maybe if you'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like, maybe she wouldn't have gone in for those thrill sports. Maybe if you'd provided more thrills at home.
F	ALEXANDRA	Grandpa.
M	SCOTT THORSON	And you, Alexandra. Putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you. Shame on you. You should try to be more like her. She's a good girl. She's a good girl.
M	SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D)	You all want a drink?
F	ALICE	Oh, do we have guests?
F	MATT	Hi, Alice. Good to see you. It's me, Matt.
F	ALICE	Good to see you too. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Hi, Tutu.
M	SCOTT THORSON	That's Alexandra.
F	ALICE	Hello.
M	SCOTT THORSON	She's your granddaughter. And this is your son-in-law Matt. This is your family. Well, except this kid. I don't know who the hell he is. Who are you? Why are you here?
F	ALEXANDRA	He's my friend.
M	SID	Good afternoon.
M	SCOTT THORSON	Alice, we're going to go to Queen's Hospital today and see Elizabeth.
F	ALICE	We are? Queen Elizabeth? That's wonderful. I've never met a queen before. I have to put on a nice dress.
M	SID	Is she serious?
M	SCOTT THORSON	You be quiet, son. No, Alice. Our Elizabeth. Our baby. We need to go visit her in the hospital. She needs us, just like when she was a little girl. Let's think about what she might want in her room. We'll take it to her and put it next to her bed.
F	ALICE	But she's a queen. I have to look good for a queen. Don't you want me to look good? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SCOTT THORSON	Shut up, Alice. Sorry, old gal. You go ahead and say whatever you want.
F	ALICE	I've never met a queen before.
M	SID	I'm sorry, man. I was just laughing. It's funny. I think she knows she's being funny.
M	SCOTT THORSON	I'm going to hit you.
F	MATT	How's the eye?
M	SID	That was unreal. I mean, how often do old people just haul off and fucking cold-cock you in the face?
F	MATT	He's hit me a couple times over the years. And watch your language.
F	ALEXANDRA	Here, let me kiss it.
M	SID	Ow!
F	MATT	Hey, could you two just cool it around me? You know, stop... touching each other so much? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SID	Whoa! Maybe that's why your wife cheated on you, if you're so against touching.
F	MATT	You little fuck. Do you get hit a lot?
M	SID	I don't know. I've had my share.
F	MATT	Your friend is completely retarded. You know that, right?
M	SID	Hey, my little brother's retarded. Don't use that word in a derogatory fashion.
F	MATT	Oh.
M	SID	Psych! I don't have a retarded brother!
F	ALEXANDRA	You suck, Sid.
M	SID	Speaking of retarded, do you ever feel bad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up? Sometimes I wait for them to cross the street, and I'm like, come on already! But then I feel bad. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Dad?
F	MATT	What?
F	ALEXANDRA	Don't forget -- I know where he lives.
F	MATT	Get in the front seat. Been doing any surfing over there on the Big Island?
M	ALEXANDRA (O.S.)	I haven't surfed in years.
M	MATT (O.S.)	Yeah, how come? You were so good.
M	ALEXANDRA (O.S.)	At first I stopped because I got my period and didn't know how to use a tampon.
M	SID (O.S.)	Didn't want to attract sharks, huh?
M	ALEXANDRA (O.S.)	So I wouldn't go for, you know, five days or so, and then I guess I just stopped. Why didn't you ask Mom to show you or teach you or whatever? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft I didn't even tell her I got my period for like a year. She was always pushing me to look older and act older, so I just... Even I know how to use a tampon.
M	ALEXANDRA (O.S.)	The first time I got my period I thought I shit my pants. Ew, maybe you did!
M	ALEXANDRA (O.S.)	Sid, shut up. Are you sure he knows what's going on with our family? Because he sure doesn't act like it.
F	ALEXANDRA	Do you know anything about him? Like what he does or if he's married?
F	MATT	Just his name. Brian Speer.
F	ALEXANDRA	Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?
F	MATT	I just didn't.
F	ALEXANDRA	Why not?
F	MATT	I didn't want to get into it.
F	ALEXANDRA	We'll google him later. Okay, there it is. Stop. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	There? He lives there?
F	ALEXANDRA	Well, I can't say for sure he lives there. That's just where I saw them.
F	MATT	And you just happened to be driving by.
F	ALEXANDRA	Sadie was driving. We both saw it.
M	SID	That house is a piece of shit. At least go after a guy who's got a mansion. And do you think he's married? That'd be pretty cold-blooded to do it in a house where you're married.
F	ALEXANDRA	Sid, please be quiet.
F	MATT	What are we going to do?
F	ALEXANDRA	I don't know. I'm just showing you the house.
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	Should I go ring the bell?
F	MATT	No, wait, this is stupid -- this stalking, or whatever the hell we're doing. We came, we saw. Whatever. Let's go.
F	ALEXANDRA	It's not like we're stalking him exactly. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	What would you do if you saw him, anyway? Talk to him or punch him or what?
F	MATT	I guess I just want to see him.
M	SID	All I know is, someone messed with my girl, all hell would break loose.
F	ALEXANDRA	Whatever, Sid.
M	SID	I mean, you'd never do that to me, would you? You know, if we ever got married. Fuck around on me.
F	ALEXANDRA	Depends on how you treated me.
F	MATT	That's enough now.
F	ALEXANDRA	And we're not getting married. Jesus.
F	MATT	Okay, that's enough. We're getting out of here.
F	ALEXANDRA	Dad, stop!
F	MATT	What?
F	ALEXANDRA	Go back.
F	MATT	Why? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Just go back a couple of houses.
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	There he is.
F	MATT	There who is?
F	ALEXANDRA	Look.
M	"FOR SALE" SIGN	complete with a PHOTO of the broker, none other than -- Now we know what he looks like.
M	SID	Must be pretty handy for a dude having an affair to have some empty houses at his fingertips. I'm just saying. That's how I'd do it.
M	MATT (V.O.)	I trusted you. But there was always something about you I didn't trust. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	BRIAN SPEER (O.S.)	Hi, this is Brian Speer at Kaimana- Prudential Realty. Sorry I missed you. Leave a message with your name, number and time of call, and I'll get back to you just as soon as I can. Mahalo.
M	SID (O.S.)	Hey, boss. Did you call him?
F	MATT	None of your business. And put some clothes on. And you're not sleeping in Alex's room. In fact, you should really go home, son.
M	SID	Alex wouldn't like that.
F	MATT	Guest room. Take it or leave it.
M	SID	We're going to do what we're going to do.
F	MATT	I'm not going to make it easy for you.
M	SID	I'm just fooling with you, man. We're not like that. Guest room's awesome. Just call him. He's nobody. Raise hell. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Yeah, hi, Brian. My name's, uh, Herb Fitzmorris. I'm interested in that house you've got on Koloa Street, the one with the plantation shutters. I'm at 645-2796. Thanks.
F	MATT	Let me go in for just a quick moment alone first. I'll be right out.
F	MATT	You were going to ask me for a divorce? So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer? Are you kidding me? Who are you? Because the only thing I know for sure is that you're a goddamned liar. So what do you have to * say for yourself? Go ahead, make a * little joke and tell me I've got it all * wrong. Tell me again I'm too out of touch with my feelings and need to go * to therapy. * Isn't the idea of marriage to make your partner's way in life a little easier? For me it was always harder with you. And you're still making it harder. Lying there on a ventilator and still fucking up my life. You're relentless. You know what? I was going to ask you for a divorce some day. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft Daddy's little girl.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	I'm bringing in your daughters now. Alex is home from school. Try to be nice, okay?
F	SCOTTIE	Hi, Mom! Look who's here.
M	SCOTTIE (CONT'D)	Say something, Alex. People in a coma can hear you. You're supposed to talk to them.
F	ALEXANDRA	Hi, Mom.
F	SCOTTIE	Tell her how you were drunk the other night. Tell her maybe you're an alcoholic.
F	ALEXANDRA	I guess it's in the genes.
F	MATT	Girls, be serious.
F	ALEXANDRA	Hi, Mom. Sorry for being bad. For wasting your money on expensive private schools. Money you could have used on facials and massages and sports equipment. Sorry for everything. Sorry we weren't good enough for you -- especially Dad.
F	MATT	Stop it. That's out of line. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Or what? You going to ground me? Or ship me off to another boarding school? You going to give me a "time out?"
F	MATT	Goddammit!
F	SCOTTIE	You got served!
F	MATT	Scottie, out in the hall.
F	SCOTTIE	She's the one out of line.
F	MATT	Go find Sid.
F	SCOTTIE	He's smoking. I shouldn't be around second-hand smoke.
F	MATT	Now!
F	ALEXANDRA	Did you just spank me?
F	MATT	You have no right to talk to your mother that way. She's going to die in a few days. What if those were your last words?
F	ALEXANDRA	I have every right to speak this way. I'm mad at her. How can you be so forgiving?
F	MATT	I'll be angry later. For now let's just think about the good parts. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft And don't say that stuff in front of your sister. Don't ruin her for Scottie. Say something else.
F	ALEXANDRA	Look, Mom, I know we fought a lot. But I always wanted to be like you. I am like you. I'm exactly like you. God, that came out so dramatic.
F	MATT	You are like her. Mostly in good ways. Maybe some bad ways. Remains to be seen.
M	SID	I hear you got spanked. I hear all hell's breaking loose in here. Hey, Mrs. K., howzit? I'm Sid, Alex's friend from Punahou, remember? Nice day outside. No clouds. Not too hot. You know what I think? Tough lady like you? I think you're going to make it. I mean, I'm no doctor. What do I know? But that's what I think.
M	SID (CONT'D)	I'm staying at your place to help Alex out. Don't worry, Mr. K.'s got me on lockdown at night. And I met your dad - - he packs a mean punch. Look at this. Wow. You're beautiful. If you look anything like her when you're older, you're lucky. I mean, you know, not exactly like she is now. I mean in general.
F	SCOTTIE	Reina just texted me! She's here visiting her grandma! Can she come visit? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Dammit, Scottie, no Reina.
F	SCOTTIE	But you said Thursday, and it's almost Thursday. I don't get to see her in school anymore.
F	MATT	Not now.
F	SCOTTIE	I need her. Alex needs Sid. I need Reina.
M	SCOTTIE (CONT'D)	Dad, this is Reina. Reina, that's my sister and Sid, and that's my mom on the bed.
F	REINA	Hi, everybody.
M	REINA (CONT'D)	So this is your mother? I guess it's true. Should I shake her hand?
F	SCOTTIE	If you want.
F	REINA	No, thanks.
F	MATT	So, Reina, I hear your grandmother's not feeling well. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	REINA	Yeah. It's pretty bad. She got her stomach operated on and then got some stupid infection or something. It's pretty gross.
F	MATT	Well, Reina, thanks for stopping by, and, here, Scottie, let me give you some money, and you two can go get an ice cream or something...
F	REINA	Too many carbs.
F	MATT	Carbs. Well, you could go to the cafeteria and get some lettuce.
F	REINA	That's okay. I'm done. You aren't a liar after all.
F	SCOTTIE	Don't you want to hang out?
F	REINA	No, I should go. I'll see you at the club. Hope your mom gets better.
F	ALEXANDRA	Scottie, what'd she mean by "You aren't a liar after all?" What'd she think you were lying about?
F	SCOTTIE	She didn't believe Mom was sleeping.
F	ALEXANDRA	So you had to prove to that twat that Mom's in a coma? What the fuck is in your skull, a bunch of stupid pills?
F	SCOTTIE	Shut up, you motherless whore!
M	SID	Whoa, whoa, easy there, half-pipe. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Where'd you learn how to talk like that?
F	ALEXANDRA	Hello? No, you've got the right number. This is his assistant Sharon. How may I help you?
F	SCOTTIE	Who is it?
F	ALEXANDRA	Oh, I see. And for how long? Uh-huh. Okay. So one or the other. I'll tell him. Mahalo.
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	That was Bonnie Tanaka, a realtor. She says Mr. Speer is on Kaua'i till the 18th, but she'd be happy to show you the house or you can stop by the open house on Sunday. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	BUZZ	Hi, Mr. King.
F	MATT	Hello, Buzz.
M	BUZZ	Sorry about Mrs. King. Hope she gets better real soon.
F	MATT	Thanks.
M	BUZZ	It really blows.
M	BUZZ (CONT'D)	Please don't tell my mom I'm drinking.
F	MATT	I won't.
M	BUZZ	Sometimes I steal beers from your outdoor fridge.
F	MATT	I know.
M	MATT (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)	You've all been asking about Elizabeth, and I've given vague answers. But the reason I've asked you all to come over today is to tell you...
F	MATT	...that her coma is permanent. She's not going to make it. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft This week -- tomorrow, in fact -- as per her wishes, we're going to unhook her from life-support. You all know Elizabeth -- she always likes to do things on her own. Goddammit. I wanted to tell you all in person. You're all our dear friends, our best friends. And the girls and I appreciate so much all the ways you've helped these last few weeks -- bringing food, calling...
M	ONE GUEST	Can we see her?
F	MATT	Yes, for God's sake, yes. That's the whole point. Go see her as soon as possible. That's what I wanted to tell you. It should be now, not after. Everyone who loves her deserves a chance to say goodbye.
M	ALEXANDRA (PRE-LAP)	You've lost your mind.
F	ALEXANDRA	You mean him? Tell him to say goodbye?
F	MATT	I'll only be gone a day or so. I'll leave in the morning, and be back tomorrow night. If it takes another day, fine -- I'll give it two days tops. If I don't find him, at least I tried. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Drop it, Dad. You've got way bigger fish to fry than confronting fucking Brian Speer. Are you recording this?
F	MATT	I'm summarizing a deposition.
F	ALEXANDRA	How can you work?
F	MATT	How can you go to a movie?
F	ALEXANDRA	To get Scottie out of the house. And you're going to tell him to come back and see Mom.
F	MATT	I think... I just think she would want him to know.
F	ALEXANDRA	Just call his office and say it's an emergency.
F	MATT	On the phone he can escape. In person he has nowhere to go. I want to see his face. I want to change his life.
F	ALEXANDRA	Then I want to go too.
F	MATT	No, you stay with Scottie.
F	ALEXANDRA	Fuck that. Let's all get out of town. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft Yo, Matt King! Whatcha doing here?
F	MATT	Just came over for a day or two.
M	COUSIN RALPH	Yeah, I just got back from Kahului. A little business over there.
F	MATT	Yeah.
M	COUSIN RALPH	All right. So you here to talk to some of the cousins? Make sure everybody's happy with your choice? Pay your respects to Cousin Hugh?
F	MATT	No, no, nothing like that. Just a little holoholo. Get the kids out of town.
M	COUSIN RALPH	But it is Holitzer, right? We all know it's Holitzer. Cousin Hugh wants him, they go way back. I got my misgivings, though. It's not the highest bid by a longshot. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft There's an argument to be made for maxing it out. We only do this once in a lifetime. And in this economy --
F	MATT	Yeah, no, I know. I want to work with you guys, Ralph, I really do. Whatever the majority wants, I'll go along with it. Let's just get it over with.
M	COUSIN RALPH	How's Elizabeth doing? She going to be okay?
F	MATT	The same.
M	COUSIN RALPH	Well, she's a tough gal. She'll be okay. Yeah. Say, where you going, Hanalei?
F	MATT	Yeah, Princeville.
M	COUSIN RALPH	Come on. I'll give you a ride.
F	MATT	Hey, Ralph.
M	COUSIN RALPH	Yeah.
F	MATT	Turn off over here. Let's go see the land.
M	COUSIN RALPH	Take a last look, huh?
F	MATT	You got time?
M	COUSIN RALPH	I got nothing but time. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	RALPH	I think this is where a golf course is going to be. They want the golf course to rival Pebble Beach, you know, bring in the big boys.
M	SID	Are you shitting me? You guys own all this land?
F	MATT	Not personally. It belongs to a trust. But yeah, it's ours for a few more days.
M	RALPH	The other side of that ridge too. You can't see it from here. It's like this, but a little flatter and doesn't have as nice a bay.
M	SID	This is outrageous.
M	COUSIN RALPH	Yep. Big resort there on that point. Commercial area over there, houses all through there. I think they should put in a big zip-line. Hell, we should have put in a zip-line. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	RALPH	Of course, part of me agrees with the cousins who don't want to sell. They're going to make a pretty big stink at the meeting.
F	MATT	I know, but we have to sell. The trust has to dissolve in seven years, and if we haven't sold, it'll be a huge mess. Selling now and distributing the cash is the only clean way to do it.
M	RALPH	But it's a shame, yeah? On the other hand, hey, it's just sitting there. No one's using it. At least this way the whole world will be able to enjoy it.
F	MATT	Take a good look, girls. In the old days, this was part of your great-great grandmother's inheritance going all the way back to Kamehameha I.
F	ALEXANDRA	Down there is where Mom and I would camp.
F	MATT	We all did, all our lives. A lot of memories.
F	SCOTTIE	What about me? I want to camp. I wish we lived in the old days.
F	ALEXANDRA	We do. We still do. Do we really have to sell?
F	MATT	Doing anything else would get extremely complicated. A lot of your cousins just want the money. Everything has its time.
F	SCOTTIE	I want us to keep it! The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SID	Can you like specify what businesses they'll put here? Because you should totally get a Cheesecake Factory. Only one so far's in Waikiki, and it's awesome. You definitely need a Cheesecake Factory. And Taco John's.
F	MATT	My grandfather. He really loved this place. So did your mother. So does your mother.
M	CLERK	Here's your credit card back, Mr. King. And how many keycards will you be needing today for your deluxe suite? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Let's say three. By the way. I'm supposed to meet a buddy of mine I think is staying here. Brian Speer. S- P-E-E-R.
M	CLERK	I'm not showing anyone by that name.
F	MATT	Thanks.
F	MATT	No, I understand. Okay. Thanks.
F	MATT	Put that out, will you please?
M	MATT (CONT'D)	You could at least smoke lights. Like Sid.
F	ALEXANDRA	I could.
F	MATT	Just got off the phone with Dr. Johnston. They did what they had to do a couple hours ago. They've moved her to another floor. They say she seems comfortable, still breathing on her own. She's doing okay. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft CONTINUED: 93 So how are you doing, Alex?
F	ALEXANDRA	What do you mean? You mean considering Mom's... circling the drain?
F	MATT	No, I mean other than that. In general. You haven't been using, have you?
F	ALEXANDRA	No, Jesus, I'm not using.
F	MATT	Not at all? I smell pot all the time on Sid.
F	ALEXANDRA	That's Sid.
F	MATT	So you just stopped? Really?
F	ALEXANDRA	Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do drugs and they stop. Unless they're like super-ghetto. And you sent me to boarding school, remember? I couldn't get anything anymore. So no, I'm not doing any drugs. But I still think they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot once in a while.
F	MATT	And a little drinking. Why are you being so honest?
F	ALEXANDRA	Mom's dying.
F	MATT	Yeah, well, I'm proud of you. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Not much to be proud of.
F	MATT	Yeah, there is. We shipped you off. Let them handle it. And now you're here, helping with Scottie, helping me. Thanks.
F	ALEXANDRA	You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that?
F	MATT	I guess she really liked him.
F	ALEXANDRA	So how are we going to find this guy, Sherlock?
F	MATT	Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of separation.
F	ALEXANDRA	We'll find him.
F	MATT	Hey, what's in your suit?
F	SCOTTIE	They're my beach boobs.
F	MATT	Take that out. Right now. Alex, Jesus, why'd you let her do that? You too, Sid. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	I don't know. Take them out, stupid.
M	SID	Yeah, Scottie. Honestly. Big boobs look kind of fatty.
F	ALEXANDRA	Any luck?
F	MATT	The hotels were a dead end, but I took another shot with his office. He's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere -- probably one of those cottages around the bay. Who wants to go for a walk?
M	SID	Sounds good.
F	ALEXANDRA	Yeah, let's go. Scottie!
F	SCOTTIE	Can we swim with the sharks? I read in the hotel magazine how they put you in a cage in the ocean and throw shark feed in the water and sharks swim right up to you. Can we do that?
F	ALEXANDRA	Scottie, we're not really here to do stuff like that. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	SCOTTIE	How'd you and Mom meet?
F	MATT	I was with a law school buddy from the mainland, and I took him to the club. We were just coming in from paddling, and your mom was on her way out, and she looked at me and said, "Do you think it's going to snow today?" We all got beers when she came back in. I had already seen her around. That was it. I got her number.
F	SCOTTIE	Did you think she was pretty?
F	MATT	She knocked me out.
F	SCOTTIE	What do you love about her?
F	MATT	I love... I don't know. The way we are with each other, most of the time, anyway. I love how she's more capable of feeling joy than anyone I've ever known. I just like being with her, just riding bikes or going out to dinner, even if it's just a plate lunch at Rainbow's. Years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together.
F	ALEXANDRA	Can we drop this? Jesus. "What do you love about Mom, Daddy?" Shut up, already. And stop babying her.
F	MATT	Easy, Alex. We're just talking. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Your mom got chased by a shark once. Very close call.
F	ALEXANDRA	When was that?
F	MATT	We were on Moloka'i with Mark and Kai, and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave. Like right beneath her. She got down on her stomach and started paddling like crazy, and this big fin kept following her. She even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore. Got cuts all over her legs and hands. Only time I ever saw your mother scared, and she was really scared. She even threw up. Crying and shaking. I had to hold her for a long time. She really thought she was going to die. Of course she hid all that from the Mitchells, turned it into a funny "Me-versus-a-shark" story. I told her...
F	ALEXANDRA	Yeah?
F	MATT	I told her it wasn't her time yet.
F	SCOTTIE	I wish Mom was here.
F	MATT	I'll ask you that same question, Scottie. What do you love about Mom?
F	SCOTTIE	Lots of stuff. She's not old and ugly like other moms. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft I like her stories -- like how she streaked at the wedding and the time she beat a wild pig with a shoe. How about you, Alex?
F	ALEXANDRA	Why are we still talking about this? I like how she's not afraid of anything.
F	SCOTTIE	Let's watch one of these!
F	ALEXANDRA	We're not watching porn.
F	SCOTTIE	Reina's dad watches pornos. Reina calls them masturbation movies. Her dad has some. She plays them when her parents aren't home and one time invited boys over to see if they grew down there. One did.
M	SID	Reina's awesome.
F	MATT	Were you there? Have you seen any of those movies?
F	SCOTTIE	No.
F	ALEXANDRA	You've got to watch her with the internet. And Reina's dad. Scottie, Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag, and you need to stay away from her. Do you want to end up like me?
F	SCOTTIE	Yes. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	I mean the earlier me, when I was mean to you and yelling at mom all the time.
F	SCOTTIE	No.
F	ALEXANDRA	Well, Reina's going to be a meth-head, and she's going to get used by stupid guys. She's a twat. Say it.
F	SCOTTIE	She's a twat. Twat, twat, twat, twat!
F	MATT	Stop that! I don't get it. I don't know what to do... these things she does. What goes on in her head? You weren't like that.
F	ALEXANDRA	It'll go away.
F	MATT	I'm not so sure. I mean, look how you kids talk in front of me. It's like you don't respect authority.
M	SID	Hey, what's up?
F	MATT	Hi. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SID	Checking on me or something?
F	MATT	I don't, uh... I haven't been sleeping very much lately.
M	SID	Understandable.
F	MATT	I'm worried about my daughters. I'm worried there's something wrong with them.
M	SID	I used to do some messed-up shit when I was a kid. Still do. It's going to get worse after your wife dies.
F	MATT	What does Alex really think about this stuff that's going on? What does she say?
M	SID	She doesn't.
F	MATT	What do you mean? I thought she talks to you all the time.
M	SID	We don't really talk about our like "issues." We just, I don't know, we deal with our shit by talking about other stuff and having a good time.
F	MATT	What would you do if you were me? How would you handle my daughters? How would you handle... the situation of this guy we're trying to find? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SID	I told you what I'd do -- I'd lay his nuts on a dresser and hit `em with a spiked bat. With the daughters, I don't know. I'd take them on a trip. Or no, I'd buy `em a bunch of shit. Like with all the money you're going to get when you sell the land -- you're going to make stupid money, right? -- dude, you could buy them anything.
F	MATT	Do you want some of it? Some money?
M	SID	Sure.
F	MATT	If I gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave?
M	SID	Why would I leave?
F	MATT	No, Sid, I'm asking you a favor. If I give you money, will you leave?
M	SID	Oh. I get it. Is that what you want? You want me to go?
F	MATT	I guess not.
M	SID	Look, dude, you're right. If I had daughters, I wouldn't know what to do. Exchange them for sons, I guess.
F	MATT	Then I might wind up with something like you.
M	SID	I'm not so bad. I'm smart.
F	MATT	You're about a hundred miles away from Smartville. No offense. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SID	You're mistaken, counselor. I'm smart. I have good hygiene. I'm an decent guitarist, a good cook. I cook food all the time. I'm vice-president of the Punahou chess club. And I always have weed.
F	MATT	I'm sure your parents are proud.
M	SID	It's possible. My mom's sort of busy right now.
F	MATT	What does she do, your mom?
M	SID	She's a receptionist at a pet clinic. But mostly she's been getting the house together after my dad died. My dad died a few months ago.
M	SID (CONT'D)	November 24th. Drunk driver. Actually both drivers were drunk. Yeah.
F	MATT	Goodnight, Sid. I'll see you tomorrow.
M	SID	Goodnight, boss. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Hi, you don't know me, but I know you. Hi, you don't know me, but I know you. Brian Speer, right? Hi, I'm Liz's husband. That's right. Fuckface.
F	MATT	Hi. You don't know me, but I know you.
F	JULIE	Stay in the zone, please! That means you, Skylar. And you too, Colt.
F	MATT	Skylar and Colt? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft I'll be right back.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	Looks like you got yourself a handful with those two.
F	JULIE	Yeah.
F	MATT	Must keep you pretty busy.
F	JULIE	They're pretty non-stop, but they're at a really fun age.
F	MATT	How old are they?
M	JULIE SPEER	Eight and ten.
F	MATT	I have two girls. Ten and seventeen. That whole non-stop thing. That never changes.
M	JULIE SPEER	You guys live here?
F	MATT	We live on O'ahu. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	JULIE SPEER	Oh, so do we.
F	MATT	Yeah, I'm just getting my girls out of town for a couple days. Their, uh, their mother is in the hospital, so I thought I'd give them a little break.
F	JULIE	Oh, no.
F	MATT	She'll be fine.
F	JULIE	What's wrong? If you don't mind my asking.
F	MATT	Just a little boating accident. Hit her head a little too hard.
F	JULIE	A sailboat? Or one with a motor?
F	MATT	One with a motor.
F	JULIE	Well, good luck with that. I wish her well. Skylar, don't go so far!
F	MATT	You guys staying in one of the cottages over there?
F	JULIE	Yes, my husband had to come here for work, so we thought we'd all make a little vacation of it. He knows the owner, so --
F	MATT	Hugh King. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	JULIE	That's right.
F	MATT	He's my cousin.
F	JULIE	Oh. Then you probably know my husband. Brian Speer?
F	MATT	No, can't say as I do.
F	JULIE	Oh, I just assumed, since he's been --
F	SCOTTIE	Dad! Dad, come here! Something bit me!
F	MATT	Excuse me. Nice talking to you.
F	JULIE	You too. Take care.
M	MATT (V.O.)	How can I forgive her for loving someone else? Did she even know about his family? Was she that in love? Does she miss him from her coma? Does she wish he could be with her and not me? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	COUSIN HUGH	yucking it up at the BAR with other REGULARS.
F	MATT	There's Cousin Hugh. Get us a table. Order me something.
F	ALEXANDRA	Like what?
F	MATT	Anything.
M	COUSIN HUGH	Heeey! Mattie-boy! What are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you until the meeting. Is that...?
F	MATT	Yeah, Scottie and Alex.
M	COUSIN HUGH	Big girls now! So what are you doing here, man?
F	MATT	Just getting the girls out of the hospital for a couple days, you know, change of scenery. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	COUSIN HUGH	Yeah, boy, what you've been going through. That's a tough deal. But Elizabeth, hey, she's, she's a tough gal, I'll tell you that. A fighter. She'll make it. Get you a drink?
F	MATT	Sure, what're you having?
M	COUSIN HUGH	Barney, an old-fashioned for my cousin here. Nice to see you, Matt. How you been otherwise?
F	MATT	Not much otherwise. Between our business and the hospital, you know, I've just trying to keep my head above water. So listen, I see you have some people staying in the cottage.
M	COUSIN HUGH	Oh, hey, Mattie, if I'd known you were coming, I coulda --
F	MATT	No, no, no, I'm just wondering about the guy you're renting to. I think his name is Brian Speer.
M	COUSIN HUGH	Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a- bitch. He's Lou's sister's... No, wait. Lou has a sister, and the sister's husband... Lou's brother-in- law is cousins with that guy.
F	MATT	Huh? Who's Lou?
M	COUSIN HUGH	No, wait. You mean the cottages on the bay or the cottage back by the trail?
F	MATT	The bay. The guy with the wife and two boys. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	COUSIN HUGH	Yeah, that's right. Determined son-of- a-bitch. Anyway, the point is the guy we're doing business with is that guy's brother-in-law. Works for him.
F	MATT	Brian Speer.
M	COUSIN HUGH	That's the guy.
F	MATT	What do you mean, the guy we're doing business with?
M	COUSIN HUGH	Who do you think? Don Holitzer.
F	MATT	Holitzer.
M	COUSIN HUGH	That's what I'm saying. That's Don's brother-in-law in the cottage. You don't know him? I would have thought you'd know him. He's a realtor over by you. So if we sell to Don -- and that's what we're going to do, right? That's what you want too. Nice guy, Don. He'll do right by us. Then when Don develops and re-sells and leases and all that --
F	MATT	Yeah, yeah --
M	COUSIN HUGH	He's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions. A lot of them, anyway. Big score for that guy.
F	MATT	What's he like?
M	COUSIN HUGH	Who? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Brian Speer -- what else do you know about him?
M	COUSIN HUGH	Not much. He's lucky. The bugga's lucky. His sister is married to the guy. Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions.
F	MATT	Not if we don't go with that bid.
M	COUSIN HUGH	We all want Don. You do too, Matt. You've said as much.
F	MATT	No, I know. You're right. Okay. Well. Good to see you, Hugh.
M	COUSIN HUGH	You too.
F	MATT	See you at the meeting.
M	COUSIN HUGH	I'll be there.
M	TRACK TO THE TABLE	firmly on MATT'S FACE as he processes this horrifying news
M	SID	This place rocks.
F	SCOTTIE	Totally.
F	ALEXANDRA	We ordered you mahi. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Great.
F	MATT	So, guess what. Turns out Brian Speer is connected to Don Holitzer.
F	ALEXANDRA	Who's Don Holitzer?
F	MATT	The guy we're going to sell to. And that woman today at the beach. That was his wife.
F	ALEXANDRA	Whose wife? The hottie with the hat? You sure? So he's married. Nice. Why didn't you say anything?
F	MATT	It's him I want to talk to, not her. I know where their cottage is.
F	ALEXANDRA	You do? So let's do it right now. Let's go knock on his door.
F	MATT	That's what I'm saying. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	MATT (CONT'D)	Don't do that. Don't be excited. This isn't fun.
F	ALEXANDRA	Well, it's what we came here to do.
F	MATT	So you to talk to his wife while I talk to him. And figure out some way to distract Scottie and their kids.
F	ALEXANDRA	Got it. Sid, come here!
F	ALEXANDRA	Listen, Dad and I are going to go talk to some friends while Sid takes you back to the hotel, okay?
F	SCOTTIE	I want to come too.
M	SID	I don't. Who wants to sit around talking in some house? Let's ditch these losers and go watch some serious TV.
F	SCOTTIE	Yeah!
M	SID	Give `em hell, boss.
F	ALEXANDRA	Are you ready?
F	MATT	No. What should I say? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	You'll think of something. You're a lawyer.
F	MATT	I'm sorry for sucking you into this. I should be doing this alone. It's selfish of me.
F	ALEXANDRA	I'm the one who sucked you in. I'm the one who knew.
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	Don't be a pussy.
F	MATT	Hi there!
M	MATT (CONT'D)	It's the guy from the beach today.
F	JULIE	Oh, hello.
F	MATT	Yeah, hey, I'm such an idiot. I just figured out I do know your husband. My daughter and I were on our way back to the hotel from dinner, and we thought we'd drop by and say howdy.
F	ALEXANDRA	Howdy?
F	JULIE	Great. Come on up.
F	MATT	I'm Matt King. This is Alexandra.
F	JULIE	I'm Julie Speer. Yeah, I thought that was you. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft You've been in the paper so much lately. I figured you had to know Brian. He's been pretty involved.
F	MATT	Yeah, no, I know, yeah, super-involved. Maybe I've met him in passing. I don't know.
F	JULIE	So, I guess you guys are deciding really soon. A couple of days, right -- you and your family meet? I'm sorry. That's probably a conflict of interest or something.
F	MATT	No, it's okay. You're right -- it'll all be over in a couple of days.
F	JULIE	You guys want a burger?
F	MATT	We just ate, thanks.
F	JULIE	A drink then.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Hi, I'm Brian.
F	MATT	Brian, we may have met before. Matt King. My wife is Elizabeth King. I think you may have met her too. Our daughter Alexandra.
F	JULIE	I was just going to get drinks.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Good, good. Good. Do you need help? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	JULIE	No, no, I got it.
F	MATT	Elizabeth is dying. Oh, wait. Fuck you. And she's dying. We unhooked her from the machines this morning. She'll be dead in a few days.
F	ALEXANDRA	We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know.
M	ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)	This is him? Why would she go for him?
F	MATT	Beats me. Well, he's very articulate.
M	BRIAN SPEER	I can't... I'm sorry. I never thought it would come to this.
F	ALEXANDRA	You're sorry my mom's going to die? You're sorry you fucked her? You're sorry you fucked over my dad?
M	BRIAN SPEER	I'm sorry for all of it.
F	MATT	Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave.
F	ALEXANDRA	You must be good at that.
F	MATT	You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	BRIAN SPEER	Okay, look, I can't have you here. You understand.
F	JULIE	Here we go. Everyone's so serious. Please don't tell me you're talking about business.
F	ALEXANDRA	We're talking about love.
F	JULIE	That's nice. Brian, call the boys in for dinner.
M	BRIAN SPEER	They're fine. Let them play a while longer.
F	ALEXANDRA	Awesome cottage you're renting.
F	MATT	Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s. Haven't been inside in years.
F	JULIE	Come on. We'll give you a tour.
F	ALEXANDRA	Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here.
F	MATT	Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind. Just a quick look. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	BRIAN SPEER	Sure. But it's not like I live here.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Here it is.
F	MATT	How did you meet? I'm curious.
M	BRIAN SPEER	I can't do this.
F	MATT	Neither can I. How did you meet?
M	BRIAN SPEER	I thought you said you came here just to tell me.
F	MATT	I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you meet?
M	BRIAN SPEER	At a party.
F	MATT	What party?
M	BRIAN SPEER	Super Bowl party.
F	MATT	At the Mitchells'.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Does that help? Does that make it better? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Hey, I'm doing you a favor here. I could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. Then what? How'd you get the nerve to ask her out?
M	MATT (CONT'D)	I want to know what makes a person cross that line. Was it about the deal? Is that when you decided she was for you?
M	BRIAN SPEER	No, no. It's not what you think. It just happened.
F	MATT	Nothing just happens.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Everything just happens.
F	MATT	Was she going to leave me?
M	BRIAN SPEER	She would have. But I, I, uh... I didn't want that. That wouldn't have happened. I love Julie. Please don't tell her. Please. I don't know what I've done. I'm sorry.
F	MATT	Did she say she loved you? Do you love her? You don't love her. You don't love her. You just used her to get to me.
M	BRIAN SPEER	No, I told you. I wasn't trying to get to you. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft It was an affair, an attraction. Sex. And she got sort of... carried away with the whole thing, and I guess I went with it. I mean, I didn't exactly say no to things. I should have. I love my family.
F	MATT	Then I guess it's all working out. Her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Hey, hey, that's really unfair. I had - - have -- a lot of respect for her. She's a wonderful woman.
F	MATT	Too bad her husband found out. You can't win `em all. One more question. Have you ever been inside my bedroom?
M	BRIAN SPEER	Once.
F	MATT	You could have had the decency to lie about that one. Well, she's in Queen's Hospital if you want to say goodbye. That really is all I came to say.
M	BRIAN SPEER	Shouldn't you be with her?
F	MATT	Yeah, great, all remodeled, new appliances. Nice. Alex, we should be getting back.
F	JULIE	Well, hey, thanks for stopping by. Really nice to meet you both. Maybe we'll see you at the beach tomorrow. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALEXANDRA	Yeah, maybe.
F	ALEXANDRA	So when do you think he'll show up?
F	MATT	I have no idea.
M	SID	Was he sorry? I hope he was sorry, man. You could have told his wife, and you didn't. I hope he knows how lucky he is. I would have told her everything. She deserves to know. Or else she's going to be a dumb bitch the rest of her life.
F	ALEXANDRA	Sid.
M	SID	I'm just saying.
F	MATT	No need to get creepy. Anyway, doesn't matter. That's all behind us.
F	ALEXANDRA	Yeah, the one we have to worry about telling things to now is Scottie.
F	MATT	I've asked Dr. Johnston to help us break the news tomorrow. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Hello, everyone. Matt. This is Dr. Herman, whom I told you about. She works with us in counseling.
M	DR. HERMAN	Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi. Hello.
F	SCOTTIE	How come Mom isn't on any more machines? Is she getting better?
M	DR. HERMAN	You must be Scottie. Scottie, I have a present for you. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	DR. HERMAN (CONT'D)	That's right. It's an octopus. Such a funny creature with its eight legs. But did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats? They have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know about the ink sac. She uses ink to confuse her predators. She can camouflage herself. She can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel. I keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt. The reason Dr. Johnston invited me here today is to meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot about you.
F	SCOTTIE	Like what?
M	DR. HERMAN	I've heard that you're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl.
M	DR. HERMAN (CONT'D)	And I've heard your mom's not doing too well and that she's going to die very soon.
F	SCOTTIE	Dad, is that true?
F	MATT	Yes, Scottie. It's true.
M	DR. HERMAN	You're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. I came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, I would like to talk to you too. I can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Okay. Thank you, Dr. Herman.
F	ALEXANDRA	What the fuck was that?
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Yes, well, they say she's very good one- on-one.
F	SCOTTIE	So Mom's going to die for sure?
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Yes. We worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and I agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. Do you know what that means?
F	SCOTTIE	It means she doesn't have a brain anymore.
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Not exactly, but... yes, that's the general idea. So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore.
F	ALEXANDRA	It's for the best, Scottie. Look at her. She's not happy like this.
M	DR. JOHNSTON	The purpose of medicine is to heal, and we can't do that now.
F	MATT	Do you understand?
F	SCOTTIE	Yes. What will we do with her body? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	First Mom's going to give some of her organs to other sick people, so she can help save their lives. That's a really neat thing she's doing. Then we're going to... we're going to scatter her ashes in the ocean. You know how Mom always loved the ocean.
F	SCOTTIE	Her ashes?
M	SCOTTIE (CONT'D)	When will she die?
M	DR. JOHNSTON	Any day now, I'm afraid. But you still have some time.
M	DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D)	Well. Let me know if you have any more questions.
F	MATT	Thanks, Sam.
F	ALEXANDRA	Come here, Scottie.
F	SCOTTIE	Do eyeballs burn?
M	SID	Hey, Scottie. Don't think about stuff like that. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	SCOTT THORSON	Here we are. Hi, Bingo. Alex.
M	SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D)	There you are again. So what did you decide?
F	MATT	There's not much left to decide. We're just sort of playing it by ear and making sure she's comfortable.
M	SCOTT THORSON	I mean what did you decide about the buyer? Who's your buyer?
M	SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D)	How much are you getting?
M	BARRY THORSON	Dad, I'm sure you'll be able to read about it in the paper.
M	SCOTT THORSON	I don't need to read about it. I can hear about it right now. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Scott, let's not talk about that here. It's not the time for that.
M	SCOTT THORSON	All the same to you, I guess. A million here, a million there. Just ironic, that's all -- Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you're coming into a fortune. She gave you everything, Matt. A good, happy home, two beautiful daughters.
F	MATT	Scott, what's your point?
M	SCOTT THORSON	She wanted her own boat. She should have had her own boat, one she would have been familiar with.
F	MATT	She wasn't even driving! Her boat, someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have made any difference. You're not going to blame me for this.
M	SCOTT THORSON	Sure, sure, quibble about the details. She was a faithful, devoted wife. She deserved more.
F	MATT	You're right. She deserved more.
M	SID	For Christ's sake, take it easy on the man.
F	ALEXANDRA	My father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	ALICE	Are we ready to go?
M	BARRY THORSON	No, Mom. Not yet.
F	MATT	Girls, Sid.
M	SID	Man, that guy's a prick. Was he always like that?
F	MATT	Yep.
M	SID	Is he praying?
F	MATT	No.
M	SCOTT THORSON	Say goodbye to Elizabeth, Alice.
F	ALICE	Oh. Goodbye, Elizabeth. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	WIDER --	Matt alone.
F	MATT	Elizabeth's not doing well.
M	COUSIN HUGH	She'll be okay. She's a fighter. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	No. She's dying. We took her off the machines.
M	COUSIN HUGH	Well, no surprise. Other than the holdouts who don't want to sell at all, it's Don Holitzer. Chicago group a distant second. Feels good. We're doing the right thing, Mattie. At least there ain't going to be any Wal-Mart. Now it's your call, and we're all behind you, most of us anyway. Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.
F	MATT	It's strange, that's all.
M	COUSIN HUGH	What's strange?
F	MATT	We didn't do anything to own that land. It was entrusted to us. And now we're just...
M	MATT (CONT'D)	I can't do it. I won't do it. I'm not going to sign.
M	COUSIN HUGH	What're you doing, Matt? I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now, but you're not going to fuck this up for us. It's over. If we don't sell now, it'll be a mess when the trust dissolves. Just sign, go to your wife, done. 105A. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
M	COUSIN SIX	It's inevitable, Matt. You know that. We'll get out of debt -- the taxes and maintenance have been leaching us for far too long. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	I don't want it to go to Holitzer. I don't want it to go to anyone. I want to keep it.
M	COUSIN SIX	For Christ's sake. We can't move without your approval. And we don't want to.
M	COUSIN HUGH	Your head's not right, Mattie. Your head's not right. You want a couple days to think it over? Take a couple days.
F	MATT	I don't need a couple days. I have the authority, and this is what I want. I haven't wanted something in a long time. We have other businesses we're converting to corporations. We can figure it out.
M	COUSIN SIX	But it's utterly unproductive land. It doesn't generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes.
M	COUSIN HUGH	You're the trustee. You know better than anyone we only have seven years left.
F	MATT	Then I have seven years to figure out how to keep it.
M	COUSIN HUGH	We'll come after you. Just because you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest of us would be afraid to come after you. But nobody wants to do that. We're family. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	People will be relieved, Hugh, the whole state. I sign that document, it's over. End of the line. Something that was ours to protect will be gone. Even though we're haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and can't even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian, we still carry Hawaiian blood, and we're still tied to this land. And our children are tied to this land. It's a miracle that for whatever bullshit reason 150 years ago, we own this much of... paradise, but we do. And for whatever bullshit reason now, I'm the trustee. And I'm not signing. And if you sue me, it'll only make us closer.
M	COUSIN HUGH	All right, everybody, listen up. Cousin Mattie has an announcement. Get ready. appearing in the doorway, topped by blonde hair and held by
F	MATT	Julie. What are you doing here?
F	JULIE	I know we just met, but I was thinking about you guys these past few days, and I knew your mom was here. I don't know. I just felt I should stop by. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	You remember Alex. This is Scottie. Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.
F	JULIE	Julie.
F	SCOTTIE	Were you friends with my mom?
F	JULIE	No, we never met. But I know a lot about her.
F	MATT	Well, we appreciate your coming by. The flowers are lovely.
M	SID	Scottie, Alex. Let's go to the cafeteria.
F	MATT	I, uh, I'm not sure how much you know about my wife's condition, but she's going to die very soon. Any minute, really. That's sort of why we're all here.
F	JULIE	I know. That's why I came. Because I know. I came because my husband wouldn't. And that just didn't seem right. I thought someone from my family should come.
F	MATT	I'm sorry I came to your house like that. Just barged in on you.
F	JULIE	It's all right. I assume you're angry. Of course you are. I'm angry too. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	So he told you, huh?
F	JULIE	After you left that night, he was acting really weird. Then I started smelling it all over him. I'd already smelled it.
F	MATT	You're a woman.
F	JULIE	I finally got it out of him. We've been going crazy ever since. Not easy with the kids around. It's all something I never could have imagined. And then your family's decision about the land. I think you're doing the right thing, but Brian is -- well, it's all so complicated and confusing.
F	MATT	I know.
F	JULIE	Brian told me everything. Well, how can I ever know it's everything? When did you find out? Have you known for a while?
F	MATT	Just a few days ago.
F	JULIE	I'm angry, but I'm just so sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. Do you mind if I say something to her?
M	JULIE (CONT'D)	Elizabeth, I'm Julie. Brian's wife. I just want to say I forgive you. I forgive you for trying to take Brian. I forgive you for almost destroying my family. I have to forgive you. Even though I want to hate you. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
F	MATT	Okay. All right. That's enough, Julie. I think... I think that's enough. He didn't love her. Just so you know. He didn't really love her.
F	JULIE	That's why I'm here.
F	MATT	Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
