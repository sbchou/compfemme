M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	JANE	I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.
M	RICKY (O.S.)	Want me to kill him for you?
F	JANE	Yeah, would you?
M	LESTER (V.O.)	My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my street. This... is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Of course, I don't know that yet.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And in a way, I'm dead already.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Look at me, jerking off in the shower. This will be the high point of my day. It's all downhill from here.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident.
M	JIM #1	Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?
M	LESTER (V.O.)	That's our next-door neighbor Jim.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And that's his lover, Jim.
M	JIM #2	What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this morning.
M	JIM #1	And a jerky treat.
M	JIM #2	You spoil her. Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.
F	CAROLYN	Good morning, Jim!
M	JIM #1	Morning, Carolyn.
F	CAROLYN	I just love your tie! That color!
M	JIM #1	I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this?
F	CAROLYN	Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Man. I get exhausted just watching her.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	My daughter Jane. Only child.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	But I don't want to lie to her.
F	CAROLYN	Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look unattractive?
F	JANE	Yes.
F	CAROLYN	Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.
F	CAROLYN	Lester, could you make me a little later, please? Because I'm not quite late enough.
F	JANE	Nice going, Dad.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back.
M	LESTER	Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I... Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my number...
M	LESTER	It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you!
M	BRAD	Hey Les. You got a minute?
M	LESTER	For you, Brad? I've got five.
M	BRAD	I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.
M	LESTER	Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right?
M	BRAD	Exactly. So...
M	LESTER	Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months?
M	BRAD	That's unsubstantiated gossip.
M	LESTER	That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!
M	BRAD	Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and--
M	LESTER	Who's expendable.
M	BRAD	It's just business.
M	LESTER	I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month?
M	BRAD	I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job.
F	CAROLYN	--there is no decision, you just write the damn thing!
M	LESTER	You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist?
F	CAROLYN	Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed.
M	LESTER	Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way.
F	CAROLYN	Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh?
F	CAROLYN	So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- --"The Real Estate King," that house would never have sat on the market for six months.
M	LESTER	Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore.
F	CAROLYN	Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was.
F	JANE	Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?
F	CAROLYN	No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.
M	LESTER	So Janie, how was school?
F	JANE	It was okay.
M	LESTER	Just okay?
F	JANE	No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.
M	LESTER	Well, you want to know how things went at my job today?
M	LESTER	They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us-- --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you?
F	JANE	Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.
F	JANE	I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken to me for months.
M	LESTER	Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee.
F	CAROLYN	What?!
F	CAROLYN	What?
M	LESTER	I'm going to get some ice cream.
M	LESTER	Honey, I'm sorry. I...
M	LESTER	I'm sorry I haven't been more available, I just... I'm...
M	LESTER	You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you...
F	JANE	Oh, great. So now it's my fault?
M	LESTER	I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault. Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals. BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY 555-0195 Carolyn Burnham
M	Another One SOLD	By Buddy Kane The Real Estate King
F	CAROLYN	I will sell this house today.
F	CAROLYN	I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today.
F	CAROLYN	I will sell this house today.
F	CAROLYN	Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!
F	CAROLYN	This living room is very dramatic. Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace!
F	CAROLYN	A simple cream would really lighten things up. You could even put in a skylight.
F	CAROLYN	Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?
F	CAROLYN	It's a dream come true for any cook. Just filled with positive energy. Huh?
F	CAROLYN	...and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs.
F	CAROLYN	You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.
M	WOMAN #1	The ad said this pool was "lagoon- like." There's nothing "lagoon-like" about it. Except for maybe the bugs.
M	WOMAN #2	There's not even any plants out here.
F	CAROLYN	What do you call this? Is this not a plant? If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape architect. Solved.
M	WOMAN #2	I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, I think tropical. This is a cement hole.
F	CAROLYN	I have some tiki torches in the garage.
F	CAROLYN	Shut up. Stop it. You... Weak!
F	CAROLYN	Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
F	ANGELA	Who are you looking for?
F	JANE	My parents are coming tonight. They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me.
F	ANGELA	Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.
F	JANE	They're such assholes. Why can't they just have their own lives?
M	LESTER	What makes you so sure she wants us to be there? Did she ask us to come?
F	CAROLYN	Of course not. She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her. But she's been practicing her steps for weeks.
M	LESTER	Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.
F	CAROLYN	Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane.
M	LESTER	Growing? She hates me.
F	CAROLYN	She's just willful.
M	LESTER	She hates you too.
M	ANNOUNCER	And now, for your half-time entertainment, Rockwell High's award- winning Dancing Spartanettes!
M	LESTER	We can leave right after this, right?
F	JANE	Oh shit, they're still here.
M	LESTER	Janie!
F	CAROLYN	Hi! I really enjoyed that!
M	LESTER	Congratulations, honey, you were great.
F	JANE	I didn't win anything.
M	LESTER	Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad.
F	ANGELA	Oh. Hi.
F	JANE	This is my friend, Angela Hayes.
M	LESTER	Okay, good to meet you. You were also good tonight. Very... precise.
F	ANGELA	Thanks.
F	CAROLYN	Nice to meet you, Angela. Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you very closely, and you didn't screw up once. Okay, we have to go.
M	LESTER	So, what are you girls doing now?
F	JANE	Dad.
F	ANGELA	We're going out for pizza.
M	LESTER	Oh really, do you need a ride? We can give you a ride. I have a car. You wanna come with us?
F	ANGELA	Thanks... but I have a car.
M	LESTER	Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great! That's great, because Janie's thinking about getting a car soon too, aren't you, honey?
F	JANE	Dad. Mom's waiting for you.
M	LESTER	Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a friend of mine.
M	LESTER	Well... I'll be seeing you around then.
F	JANE	Could he be any more pathetic?
F	ANGELA	I think it's sweet. And I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time.
M	LESTER	It's the weirdest thing.
M	LESTER	I feel like I've been in a coma for about twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.
M	LESTER	Spec-tac-ular.
F	JANE	I'm sorry my dad was so weird tonight.
F	ANGELA	It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over me. It started when I was about twelve, I'd go out to dinner with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking. Just like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off.
F	JANE	Vomit.
F	ANGELA	No, I liked it. And I still like it. If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a shot at being a model. Which is great, because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.
F	JANE	I really think it'll happen for you.
F	ANGELA	Oh, I know. Because everything that was meant to happen, does. Eventually.
F	JANE	Asshole.
F	ANGELA	Hello? Hello?
F	JANE	Hello?
F	ANGELA	Why'd you call me?
F	JANE	I didn't.
F	ANGELA	Well, my phone just rang and I answered it and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back.
F	JANE	I was in the shower.
F	JANE	Oh, gross.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)	Rick-y! Break-fast!
M	RICKY	Be right there.
M	RICKY	Mom.
F	BARBARA	Hello.
M	RICKY	I don't eat bacon, remember?
F	BARBARA	I'm sorry, I must have forgotten.
M	RICKY	What's new in the world, Dad?
M	COLONEL	This country is going straight to hell.
M	COLONEL	Are you expecting anyone?
F	BARBARA	No. No.
M	JIM #1	Hi.
M	JIM #2	Welcome to the neighborhood.
M	JIM #1	Just a little something from our garden.
M	JIM #2	Except for the pasta, we got that at Fallaci's.
M	JIM #1	It's unbelievably fresh. You just drop it in the water and it's done.
M	JIM #1	Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down. Welcome to the neighborhood.
M	COLONEL	Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
M	JIM #1	Nice to meet you. And this is my partner...
M	JIM #2	Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.
M	COLONEL	Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are you guys selling?
M	JIM #2	Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors--
M	COLONEL	Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're partners. So what's your business?
M	JIM #1	Well, he's a tax attorney.
M	JIM #2	And he's an anesthesiologist.
M	COLONEL	How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless?
M	RICKY	That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.
M	COLONEL	Well, it is.
M	RICKY	Yeah, you're right.
M	COLONEL	Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.
M	RICKY	Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out.
M	COLONEL	Me too, son. Me too.
F	ANGELA	I'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out. You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy.
M	TEENAGE GIRL #1	Gross.
F	ANGELA	It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
M	TEENAGE GIRL #1	So, did you do it with him?
F	ANGELA	Of course I did. He is a really well- known photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
M	TEENAGE GIRL #2	You are a total prostitute.
F	ANGELA	Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick.
M	TEENAGE GIRL #2	So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington.
F	ANGELA	Cunt! I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.
F	JANE	Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.
F	ANGELA	Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.
F	JANE	You know him?
F	ANGELA	Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution.
F	JANE	Why? What did he do?
F	ANGELA	What do you mean?
F	JANE	Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.
F	ANGELA	You total slut. You've got a crush on him.
F	JANE	What? Please.
F	ANGELA	You were defending him! You love him. You want to have like, ten thousand of his babies.
F	JANE	Shut up.
M	RICKY	Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you.
F	JANE	I know. I kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night?
M	RICKY	I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
F	JANE	Thanks, but I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.
M	RICKY	I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.
F	ANGELA	What a freak. And why does he dress like a Bible salesman?
F	JANE	He's like, so confident. That can't be real.
F	ANGELA	I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't even like, look at me once.
M	RICKY	Hey.
F	BARBARA	I'm sorry, what?
M	RICKY	Mom. Nobody said anything.
F	BARBARA	Oh. I'm sorry.
F	CAROLYN	--everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other. How would it look if I showed up with no one?
M	LESTER	Well, you always end up ignoring me and going off--
F	CAROLYN	Now listen to me. This is an important business function. As you know, my business is selling an image. And part of my job is to live that image--
M	LESTER	Just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda.
F	CAROLYN	Hi, Shirley! Listen, just do me a favor. Act happy tonight?
M	LESTER	I am happy, honey.
F	CAROLYN	Oh! Buddy!
F	CAROLYN	Buddy! Buddy. Hi! Good to see you again.
M	BUDDY	It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
F	CAROLYN	Carolyn.
M	BUDDY	Carolyn! Of course. How are you?
F	CAROLYN	Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
F	CHRISTY	Hello.
F	CAROLYN	My husband, Lester--
M	BUDDY	It's a pleasure.
M	LESTER	Oh, we've met before, actually. This thing last year. Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton.
M	BUDDY	Oh, yes.
M	LESTER	It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.
F	CAROLYN	Honey. Don't be weird.
M	LESTER	All right, honey. I won't be weird. I'll be whatever you want me to be.
M	LESTER	We have a very healthy relationship.
M	BUDDY	I see.
M	LESTER	Well. I don't know about you, but I need a drink.
M	LESTER	Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.
M	RICKY	Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door?
M	LESTER	Yeah.
M	RICKY	I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you.
M	LESTER	Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.
M	RICKY	Hi, Lester Burnham.
M	RICKY	Do you party?
M	LESTER	Excuse me?
M	RICKY	Do you get high?
F	CAROLYN	You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but... I am in complete awe of you. I mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. You know, I'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing. I suppose, technically, I'm the "competition," but... I mean, hey, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league as you...
M	BUDDY	I'd love to.
F	CAROLYN	Really?
M	BUDDY	Absolutely. Call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch.
F	CAROLYN	I'll do that. Thank you.
M	LESTER	...Did you ever see that movie, where the body's walking around holding its own head? And then the head goes down on that babe?
M	RICKY	Re-Animator.
M	CATERING BOSS	Look. I'm not paying you to... ...do whatever it is you're doing out here.
M	RICKY	Fine. So don't pay me.
M	CATERING BOSS	Excuse me?
M	RICKY	I quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now, leave me alone.
M	CATERING BOSS	Asshole.
M	LESTER	I think you just became my personal hero. Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?
M	RICKY	Eighteen. I just do these gigs as a cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.
M	CAROLYN (O.S.)	Lester?
F	CAROLYN	What are you doing?
M	LESTER	Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts. This is Ricky Fitts.
M	RICKY	I'm Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the house next to you. I go to school with your daughter.
M	LESTER	With Jane? Really?
M	RICKY	Yeah. Jane.
F	CAROLYN	Hi. I'm ready to go. I'll meet you out front.
M	LESTER	Uh-oh. I'm in trouble. Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the, uh, thing.
M	RICKY	Any time.
M	RICKY	Lester. If you want any more, you know where I live.
F	JANE	Oh, shit. They're home. Quick, let's go up to my room.
F	ANGELA	I should say hi to your dad. I don't want to be rude.
M	ANGELA (O.S.)	Nice suit.
F	ANGELA	You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.
F	ANGELA	Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound up. Ooh, is that root beer?
F	ANGELA	I love root beer, don't you?
F	JANE	Mom, you remember Angela.
F	CAROLYN	Yes, of course!
F	JANE	I forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. Is that okay?
M	LESTER	Sure!
F	JANE	I'm sorry about my dad.
F	ANGELA	Don't be. I think it's funny.
F	JANE	Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones. But to me... he's just too embarrassing to live.
F	ANGELA	Your mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony.
F	ANGELA	Shut up.
M	ANGELA (O.S.)	He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot.
F	JANE	Shut up.
F	ANGELA	Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.
F	JANE	You are so grossing me out right now.
F	ANGELA	If he built up his chest and arms, I would totally fuck him.
M	ANGELA (O.S.)	I would! I would suck your dad's big fat dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his eyes rolled back in his head! What was that noise? Jane.
F	ANGELA	I swear I heard something.
F	JANE	Yeah, it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig.
F	ANGELA	I'm serious.
F	ANGELA	See?
F	ANGELA	Oh my God. Jane.
F	ANGELA	It's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you? What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?
F	JANE	Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.
F	ANGELA	Really?
M	LESTER	Shit. Shit!
M	RICKY	Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos.
M	COLONEL (O.S.)	Ricky!
M	RICKY	Coming, Dad. You know I don't like locked doors in my house, boy.
M	RICKY	I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident. So what's up?
M	COLONEL	I need a urine sample.
M	RICKY	Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz.
M	COLONEL	Yeah, I suppose. Well. Good night, son.
F	ANGELA	I've been waiting for you.
F	ANGELA	You've been working out, haven't you? I can tell.
F	ANGELA	I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, very dirty.
F	CAROLYN	What are you doing?
M	LESTER	Nothing.
F	CAROLYN	You were masturbating.
M	LESTER	I was not.
F	CAROLYN	Yes, you were.
M	LESTER	All right, so shoot me. I was whacking off.
M	LESTER	That's right. I was choking the bishop. Shaving the carrot. Saying hi to my monster.
F	CAROLYN	That's disgusting.
M	LESTER	Well, excuse me, but I still have blood pumping through my veins!
F	CAROLYN	So do I!
M	LESTER	Really? I'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.
F	CAROLYN	Lester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage.
M	LESTER	This hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.
F	CAROLYN	Oh. I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated?
M	LESTER	I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm ready.
F	CAROLYN	Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin!
M	LESTER	On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.
M	LESTER	Turn out the light when you come to bed, okay?
M	LESTER (V.O.)	It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.
M	LESTER	Hey! You guys!
M	JIM #2	Lester, I didn't know you ran.
M	LESTER	Well, I just started.
M	JIM #1	Good for you.
M	LESTER	I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.
M	JIM #1	Well, are you just looking to lose weight, or do you want have increased strength and flexibility as well?
M	LESTER	I want to look good naked.
M	COLONEL	What is this, the fucking gay pride parade?
M	LESTER	Hey! Yo! Ricky! My entire life is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.
M	LESTER	Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham, I live next door. We haven't met.
M	COLONEL	Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
M	LESTER	Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
M	LESTER	So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the, uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked about...
M	RICKY	Re-Animator.
M	LESTER	Yeah!
M	RICKY	You want to borrow it? Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.
M	RICKY	Can you hold this for a sec?
M	LESTER	Sure.
M	RICKY	I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know.
M	LESTER	What is this?
M	RICKY	Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean.
M	LESTER	Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night.
M	RICKY	It's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.
M	LESTER	You like Pink Floyd?
M	RICKY	I like a lot of music.
M	LESTER	Man, I haven't listened to this album in years.
M	RICKY	How much do you want?
M	LESTER	I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce?
M	RICKY	Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred.
M	LESTER	Wow.
M	RICKY	But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no paranoia.
M	LESTER	Is that what we smoked last night?
M	RICKY	This is all I ever smoke.
M	LESTER	How much?
M	RICKY	Two grand.
M	LESTER	Jesus. Things have changed since
M	RICKY	You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
M	LESTER	Thanks.
M	RICKY	There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash.
M	LESTER	Well, now I know how you can afford all this equipment. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track.
M	RICKY	That sucks.
M	LESTER	No actually, it was great. All I did was party and get laid. I had my whole life ahead of me...
M	RICKY	My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs. Never underestimate the power of denial.
M	LESTER	Uh-oh, mom's mad.
F	CAROLYN	What the hell do you think you're doing?
M	LESTER	Bench presses. I'm going to wail on my pecs, and then I'm going to do my back.
F	CAROLYN	I see you're smoking pot now. I'm so glad. I think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example to set for our daughter.
M	LESTER	You're one to talk, you bloodless, money-grubbing freak.
F	CAROLYN	Lester. You have such hostility in you!
M	LESTER	Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here. Unless you want to spot me.
F	CAROLYN	You will not get away with this. You can be sure of that!
M	LESTER	That's. What. You. Think.
M	BRAD	"...my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off, while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell." Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
M	LESTER	Brad, for fourteen years I've been a whore for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.
M	BRAD	Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
M	LESTER	Well, just what sort of severance package is "management" prepared to offer me? Considering the information I have about our editorial director buying pussy with company money.
M	LESTER	Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S., since it technically constitutes fraud. And I'm sure that some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well. Not to mention, Craig's wife.
M	BRAD	What do you want?
M	LESTER	One year's salary, with benefits.
M	BRAD	That's not going to happen.
M	LESTER	Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot?
M	BRAD	Against who?
M	LESTER	Against you.
M	LESTER	Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me?
M	BRAD	Man. You are one twisted fuck.
M	LESTER	Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.
M	LESTER	Yeah!
M	BUDDY	Carolyn.
F	CAROLYN	Buddy.
M	BUDDY	I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left for New York this morning, and... let's just say things were very hectic around the house.
F	CAROLYN	What's she doing in New York?
M	BUDDY	She's moving there. Yes. We are splitting up.
F	CAROLYN	Buddy. I'm so sorry.
M	BUDDY	Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. Oh. Wow. Ah, it's for the best.
F	CAROLYN	When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
M	BUDDY	Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times.
M	ANGELA (O.S.)	What are you doing?
M	RICKY (O.S.)	I was filming this dead bird.
F	ANGELA	Why?
M	RICKY (O.S.)	Because it's beautiful.
F	ANGELA	I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy.
M	RICKY (O.S.)	Hi, Jane.
F	JANE	Look. I want you to stop filming me.
M	RICKY	Okay.
F	ANGELA	Well, whatever. This is boring. Let's go.
F	JANE	Do you need a ride?
F	ANGELA	Are you crazy? I don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.
M	RICKY	It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks.
F	ANGELA	Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway. C'mon, let's go.
F	JANE	I think I'm going to walk, too.
F	ANGELA	What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile.
F	CAROLYN	Yes! Oh, God! I love it!
M	BUDDY	You like getting nailed by the king?
F	CAROLYN	Oh yes! I love it! Fuck me, your majesty!
M	LESTER	AMERICAN WOMAN, STAY AWAY FROM ME... AMERICAN WOMAN, MAMA LET ME BE... DON'T COME A HANGIN' AROUND MY DOOR... I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE NO MORE...
M	DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.S.)	Smile you're at Mr. Smiley's.
M	LESTER	What?
M	DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.S.)	Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita just a dollar twenty- nine for a limited time only.
M	LESTER	Uh... no. But thank you. I'll have a Big Barn Burger, Smiley fries, and an orange soda.
M	DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.S.)	Please drive up to the window, thank you.
M	DRIVE-THRU GIRL	Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be four eighty-nine, please.
M	COUNTER GIRL	Would you like some Smiley Sauce?
M	LESTER	No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out an application.
M	COUNTER GIRL	There's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter.
M	LESTER	Good. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.
M	MANAGER	I don't think you'd fit in here.
M	LESTER	I have fast food experience.
M	MANAGER	Yeah, like twenty years ago.
M	LESTER	Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.
F	CAROLYN	That was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so to speak.
F	CAROLYN	I was so stressed out.
M	BUDDY	Know what I do when I feel like that?
F	CAROLYN	What?
M	BUDDY	I fire a gun.
F	CAROLYN	Really.
M	BUDDY	Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few rounds.
F	CAROLYN	I've never fired a gun before.
M	BUDDY	Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful. Well, almost nothing.
F	JANE	So how do you like your new house?
M	RICKY	I like it.
F	JANE	The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And then she cut down their tree.
M	RICKY	Have you ever known anybody who died?
F	JANE	No. Have you?
M	RICKY	No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad.
M	RICKY	I got that homeless woman on video.
F	JANE	Why would you film that?
M	RICKY	Because it was amazing.
F	JANE	What was amazing about it?
M	RICKY	When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back.
F	JANE	And what do you see?
M	RICKY	Beauty.
M	RICKY	Mom, I want you to meet somebody. Mom.
F	BARBARA	Yes?
M	RICKY	I want you to meet somebody. This is Jane.
F	JANE	Hi.
F	BARBARA	Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.
M	RICKY	This is where my dad hides out.
F	JANE	I take it he's got a thing for guns.
M	RICKY	You got to see this one thing...
M	RICKY	My dad would kill me if he knew I was in here.
F	JANE	Did you steal his keys?
M	RICKY	No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He was short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade.
M	RICKY	Turn it over.
F	JANE	Oh my God.
M	RICKY	It's like official state china of the Third Reich. There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit. But my dad just has this one thing.
M	RICKY	What's wrong?
F	JANE	Nothing.
M	RICKY	No, you're scared of me.
F	JANE	No I'm not.
M	RICKY	You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?
M	RICKY	It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? And this bag was just... dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.
M	RICKY	Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember...
M	RICKY	Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in.
F	JANE	Oh my God. What time is it?
F	JANE	Sorry I'm late.
F	CAROLYN	No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey?
M	LESTER	Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus.
F	CAROLYN	Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.
M	LESTER	And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink.
F	CAROLYN	How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job!
M	LESTER	Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like, "Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus.
F	CAROLYN	Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now--
M	LESTER	I already have a job.
F	CAROLYN	No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn. You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't mind. I really don't. You mean, everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job--
M	LESTER	Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus?
F	JANE	Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this--
M	LESTER	Sit down.
M	LESTER	I'm sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist. You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it and I don't complain. All I want is the same courtesy--
F	CAROLYN	Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of--
M	LESTER	Don't interrupt me, honey.
M	LESTER	Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music. Because frankly, and I don't think I'm alone here, I'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.
F	JANE	Go. Away.
M	CAROLYN (O.S.)	Honey, please let me in.
F	CAROLYN	I wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight. But in a way, I'm glad.
F	JANE	Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad really are?
F	CAROLYN	Me?
F	JANE	Aw, Christ, Mom.
F	CAROLYN	No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself. You cannot count on anyone except yourself. It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better.
F	JANE	Look, Mom, I really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, okay?
F	CAROLYN	You ungrateful little brat. Just look at everything you have. When I was your age, I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have our own house.
M	COLONEL	You little bastard--
M	COLONEL	How did you get in there?
M	COLONEL	How!? How?! C'mon, get up! Fight back, you little pussy!
M	RICKY	No, sir. I won't fight you.
M	COLONEL	How did you get in there?
M	RICKY	I picked the lock, sir.
M	COLONEL	What were you looking for? Money? Are you on dope again?
M	RICKY	No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate.
M	COLONEL	Girlfriend?
M	RICKY	Yes, sir. She lives next door.
M	RICKY	Her name's Jane.
M	COLONEL	This is for your own good, boy. You have no respect for other people's things, for authority, for...
M	RICKY	Sir, I'm sorry.
M	COLONEL	You can't just go around doing whatever you feel like, you can't-- there are rules in life--
M	RICKY	Yes, sir.
M	COLONEL	You need structure, you need discipline--
M	RICKY	Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me. Don't give up on me, Dad.
M	COLONEL	Oh, Ricky...
M	COLONEL	You stay out of there.
M	ATTENDANT	I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here I thought you would be hopeless. But you're a natural.
F	CAROLYN	Well, all I know is... I love shooting this gun!
M	LESTER	What?
F	CAROLYN	Ah, whose car is that out front?
M	LESTER	Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I always wanted and now I have it. I rule!
F	CAROLYN	Where's the Camry?
M	LESTER	I traded it in.
F	CAROLYN	Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
M	LESTER	Hmm, let me think... No. You never drove it. Have you done something different? You look great.
F	CAROLYN	Where's Jane?
M	LESTER	Jane not home. We have the whole house to ourselves.
M	LESTER	Christ, Carolyn. When did you become so... joyless?
F	CAROLYN	Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy in my life.
M	LESTER	Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I haven't.
F	CAROLYN	Lester. You're going to spill beer on the couch.
M	LESTER	So what? It's just a couch.
F	CAROLYN	This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not "just a couch."
M	LESTER	It's just a couch!
M	LESTER	This isn't life. This is just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.
M	LESTER	I'm only trying to help you.
F	JANE	Don't.
M	RICKY	Why?
F	JANE	It's weird, watching myself. I don't like how I look.
M	RICKY	I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.
F	JANE	I'm not going to sit here for that shit.
F	JANE	Ha. How does it feel now?
M	RICKY	Fine.
F	JANE	You don't feel naked?
M	RICKY	I am naked.
F	JANE	You know what I mean.
F	JANE	Tell me about being in the hospital.
M	RICKY	When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right? Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off. That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.
F	JANE	Wow. You must really hate him.
M	RICKY	He's not a bad man.
F	JANE	Well... you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to me. Wait. I do hate my father.
M	RICKY	Why?
F	JANE	He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting.
M	RICKY	You'd rather he had the crush on you?
F	JANE	Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is. I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. He's doing massive psychological damage to me.
M	RICKY	How?
F	JANE	Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline.
F	JANE	I'm serious, though. How could he not be damaging me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.
M	RICKY	Want me to kill him for you?
F	JANE	Yeah, would you?
M	RICKY	It'll cost you.
F	JANE	Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten. I've got almost three thousand dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job.
F	JANE	But my tits can wait, huh?
M	RICKY	You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.
F	JANE	Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I?
F	JANE	You know I'm not serious, right?
M	RICKY	Of course.
M	RICKY	Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other?
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Remember those posters that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life?" Well, that's true of every day except one. The day you die.
F	CAROLYN	Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important appointment--
F	JANE	Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
F	CAROLYN	Well, of course, she's always welcome. You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while.
M	LESTER	What?
F	JANE	I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave.
M	LESTER	What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.
F	JANE	Dad! You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk! It's disgusting!
M	LESTER	You better watch yourself, Janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother.
M	LESTER	Fuck.
M	COLONEL	You ready to go?
M	RICKY	Oh, I don't need a ride. I'm going to go in with Jane and her mom.
M	LESTER	Yo, Ricky. How's it going?
M	RICKY	Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.
M	CO-WORKER	Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with cheese, A.S.A.P.
M	LESTER	You need more than that, my little hombre. What's good here? Nothing.
M	CAROLYN (O.S.)	Then I guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we? I think I'll have a double Smiley Sandwich and curly fries, and a vanilla shake.
M	BUDDY (O.S.)	Make that two.
M	COUNTER GIRL (O.S.)	Please drive around thank you.
F	CAROLYN	I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning.
M	BUDDY	I'm flattered.
M	LESTER	Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's!
M	LESTER	Would you like to try our new beef and cheese pot pie on a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a limited time only?
F	CAROLYN	We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my--
M	LESTER	Her husband. We've met before, but something tells me you're going to remember me this time.
M	COUNTER GIRL	Whoa. You are so busted.
F	CAROLYN	You know, this really doesn't concern you.
M	LESTER	Actually, Janeane is senior drive- thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf. So. This makes sense.
F	CAROLYN	Oh, Lester--
M	LESTER	Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy. Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?
F	CAROLYN	Lester, just stop it!
M	LESTER	Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to do. Ever again.
M	BUDDY	I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for a while. I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.
F	CAROLYN	Oh, no. I understand completely. In order to be successful, one must project an image of success. At all times.
F	CAROLYN	Stop it. Stop it!
M	LESTER	Shit.
M	RICKY	I have to run next door. Jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework.
F	ANGELA	So you and psycho boy are fucking on like, a regular basis now, right?
F	JANE	No.
F	ANGELA	Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick?
F	JANE	Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick with you, okay? It's not like that.
F	ANGELA	Not like what? Doesn't he have one? Why don't you want to talk about it? I mean, I tell you every single detail about every guy that I fuck.
F	JANE	Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I don't really want to hear all that.
F	ANGELA	Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it? We gotta get you a real man.
M	RICKY	You got any papers?
M	LESTER	Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there. You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. "No I can't. Really. Okay."
M	RICKY	You should learn to roll a joint.
M	LESTER	Oh. Hi.
F	JANE	Where's Mom?
M	LESTER	Don't know.
F	ANGELA	Hi, Mr. Burnham.
M	LESTER	Hi.
F	ANGELA	Wow. Look at you. Have you been working out?
M	LESTER	Some.
F	ANGELA	You can really tell. Look at those arms.
M	LESTER	You like muscles?
F	ANGELA	I--I should probably go see what Jane's up to.
M	COLONEL (O.S.)	Where'd you get that?
M	RICKY	From my job. Don't lie to me. I saw you with him.
M	RICKY	You were watching me?
M	COLONEL	What did he make you do?
M	RICKY	Dad, you don't really think... me and Mr. Burnham?
M	COLONEL	Don't you laugh at me! I will not sit back and watch my only son become a cocksucker!
M	RICKY	Jesus, what is with you--
M	COLONEL	I swear to God, I will throw you out of this house and never look at you again.
M	RICKY	You mean that?
M	COLONEL	Damn straight I do. I'd rather you were dead than be a fucking faggot.
M	RICKY	You're right. I suck dick for money.
M	COLONEL	Boy--
M	RICKY	Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
M	COLONEL	Get out.
M	RICKY	And you should see me fuck. I'm the best piece of ass in three states.
M	COLONEL	Get out!! I don't ever want to see you again!!
M	RICKY	What a sad old man you are.
M	COLONEL	Get out.
M	RICKY	Mom, I'm leaving.
F	BARBARA	Okay, wear a raincoat.
M	RICKY	I wish things would have been better for you. Take care of Dad.
M	TAPE VOICE	--disinvesting problems of their power, and removing their ability to make us afraid. This is the secret to "me-centered" living. Only by taking full responsibility for your problems--and their solutions--will you ever be able to break free from the constant cycle of victimhood.
M	TAPE VOICE	Remember, you are only a victim if you choose to be a victim...
F	JANE	I don't think we could be friends anymore.
F	ANGELA	You are way too uptight about sex.
F	JANE	Just don't fuck my dad, all right? Please?
F	ANGELA	Why not?
F	JANE	Dad! Leave us alone! It's me.
M	RICKY	If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
F	JANE	What?
M	RICKY	If I had to go to New York. To live. Tonight. Would you come with me?
F	JANE	Yes.
F	ANGELA	You guys can't be serious. You're just a kid. And he's like, a mental case. You'll end up living in a box on the street.
F	JANE	I'm no more a kid than you are! We can use my plastic surgery money.
M	RICKY	We won't have to. I have over forty thousand dollars. And I know people in the city who can help us get set up.
F	ANGELA	What, other drug dealers?
M	RICKY	Yes.
F	ANGELA	Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him.
F	JANE	Why do you even care?
F	ANGELA	Because you're my friend!
M	RICKY	She's not your friend. She's somebody you use to feel better about yourself.
F	ANGELA	Go fuck yourself, psycho!
F	JANE	You shut up, bitch!
F	ANGELA	Jane! He is a freak!
F	JANE	Well, then so am I! And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people. And you'll never be a freak because you're just too perfect.
F	ANGELA	Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly.
M	RICKY	Yes, you are. And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary. And you know it.
F	ANGELA	You two deserve each other.
M	LESTER	Jesus, man. You're soaked.
M	LESTER	You want me to get Ricky? He's in Jane's room.
M	LESTER	You okay?
M	COLONEL	Where's your wife?
M	LESTER	Uh... I don't know. Probably out fucking that dorky prince of real estate asshole. And you know what? I don't care.
M	COLONEL	Your wife is with another man and you don't care?
M	LESTER	Nope, our marriage is just for show. A commercial, for how normal we are. When we are anything but.
M	LESTER	You're shaking.
M	LESTER	We really should get you out of these clothes.
M	COLONEL	Yes...
M	LESTER	It's okay.
M	COLONEL	I...
M	LESTER	Just tell me what you need.
M	LESTER	Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. You got the wrong idea.
M	TAPE VOICE	"I refuse to be a victim." When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head--
F	CAROLYN	I refuse to be a victim.
F	ANGELA	I hope you don't mind if I play the stereo.
M	LESTER	Not at all. Bad night?
F	ANGELA	Not really bad, just... strange.
M	LESTER	Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine.
F	ANGELA	Jane and I had a fight. It was about you.
F	ANGELA	She's mad at me because I said I think you're sexy.
M	LESTER	Do you want a sip?
M	LESTER	So... are you going to tell me? What you want?
F	ANGELA	I don't know.
M	LESTER	You don't know?
F	ANGELA	What do you want?
M	LESTER	Are you kidding? I want you. I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you. You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
F	ANGELA	You don't think I'm ordinary?
M	LESTER	You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.
F	ANGELA	Thank you. I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary...
F	CAROLYN	I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim... Lester, I have something I have to say to you...
F	JANE	Are you scared?
M	RICKY	I don't get scared.
F	JANE	My parents will try to find me.
M	RICKY	Mine won't.
F	ANGELA	This is my first time.
M	LESTER	You're kidding.
F	ANGELA	I'm sorry.
F	ANGELA	I still want to do it... I just thought I should tell you... in case you wondered why I wasn't... better.
F	ANGELA	What's wrong? I thought you said I was beautiful.
M	LESTER	You are beautiful.
M	LESTER	You are so beautiful... and I would be a very lucky man...
F	ANGELA	I feel so stupid.
M	LESTER	Don't.
F	ANGELA	I'm sorry.
M	LESTER	You have nothing to be sorry about.
M	LESTER	It's okay. Everything's okay.
F	ANGELA	Wow. I was starving.
M	LESTER	Do you want me to make you another one?
F	ANGELA	No, no, no. I'm fine.
M	LESTER	You sure?
F	ANGELA	I mean, I'm still a little weirded out, but... ...I feel better. Thanks.
M	LESTER	How's Jane?
F	ANGELA	What do you mean?
M	LESTER	I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is she miserable? I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it.
F	ANGELA	She's... she's really happy. She thinks she's in love.
M	LESTER	Good for her.
F	ANGELA	How are you?
M	LESTER	God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that. I'm great.
F	ANGELA	I've gotta go to the bathroom.
M	LESTER	I'm great.
M	LESTER	Man oh man... Man oh man oh man...
F	JANE	Oh God.
M	RICKY	Wow.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	First of all, that one second isn't a second at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time... For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And yellow leaves, from the maple trees, that lined my street...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Or my grandmother's hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's brand new Firebird...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And Janie...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And Janie...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	And... Carolyn.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	...and then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry...
M	LESTER (V.O.)	You will someday.
M	THE END
