M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	AUTOMATED VOICE	Thank you for your patience. Your call is important to us. We will be with you shortly. On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer; Thank you for your patience. Your call is important to us. We will be with you shortly. Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless. She taps her Thank you for your patience. Your call is - A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts.
M	FEMALE VOICE	Mrs Greenslade, thank you for Yes, now if you could stay on the phone for a moment and talk to me, just talk to me. I'm not even clear, I don't actually understand what it is I'm trying to order. Is wireless the same as wi-fi? And what do either of them have to do with broadband?
M	FEMALE VOICE	Mrs Greenslade, since the account is not in your name, before we can make any changes we need to speak to the account holder. Can I please talk to the account holder?
F	EVELYN	What?
M	FEMALE VOICE	I'm asking if I can speak to the account holder. Before we can make any changes -
F	EVELYN	You can't talk to him, no. He's dead. He died. There's only me.
M	GILES	We're late.
F	GRAHAM	Bloody retirement parties. Hard cheese, soft wine, and endless speeches. Why do people do that? No one ever said about any kind of party: it was a wonderful occasion, just a shame that the speeches were so short.
M	GILES	it'll be you one day.
F	GRAHAM	One day very soon.
M	GILES	You've been saying that for years. They walk into a large room, full of lawyers.
M	JUDGE	An occasion such as this leads one to cast ones mind back to the days when I first entered my pupillage. I had the very good fortune of serving as a junior to Mr Justice Stancombe Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the
M	JUDGE (CONT'D)	. the unwelcome news that I would transfer Chambers, bringing to mind the old adage a fronte praecipitium, a tergo 1upi Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
F	GRAHAM	This is the day. Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
M	GILES	Graham?
F	GRAHAM	This is the day. He turns and walks out. The Head Nurse, KAREN, rushes past.
F	MURIEL	Listen, young lady. I want a cup of tea, and I want it now.
M	KAREN	The trolley will be along shortly.
F	MURIEL	How hard d'you have to fall down before you get some proper attention? Hours I've been lying here, and not a single doctor has come to see me. 3A.
M	KAREN	Now that's not quite true, is it Mrs Donnelly? A doctor did try and examine you, and you sent him away.
F	MURIEL	That one? She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is
F	MURIEL	He can wash all he likes, that colour's not coming out. I want an English doctor.
M	KAREN	An English doctor? Why didn't you say so? I'll get one right away. She goes away, comes back moments later with a tall,
M	KAREN (CONT'D)	This is Dr Ghujarapartidar. And this is Mrs Donnelly. A mobility scooter carrying an elderly resident trundles
M	ESTATE AGENT (O.S.)	.. with an unlimited range of leisure opportunities just a stone's throw away...
M	EVAN	So as I say, what you're looking at here is very competitively priced, you can't get better value for your grey pound. Another little feature, not necessary right now, but give it a couple of years . rails on the walls to help you get around, and down here, a panic button in case of a sudden fall, brings the Warden running.
F	JEAN	What if we fell somewhere else?
M	EVAN	Sorry?
F	JEAN	It's just that we might not manage to plan our sudden fall in the exact corner where the button is.
M	EVAN	Yeah. As I say -
F	JEAN	And would it be possible to get the rail to go through the middle of the room as well?
F	JEAN	To help us get across, not just around? Could we have a moment, please? Thanks. Thanks so much. Evan goes.
F	JEAN	Thirty years in the Civil Service and this is all we can afford?
M	DOUGLAS	Would it help if I apologized again?
F	JEAN	No. But try it anyway.
F	JUDITH	And then after that I worked as a systems analyst for a few years but I just found it so dull, what I really wanted was to do something that was more creative, that matched my ... I'm sorry. On the form they asked for our age bracket, and the age we wanted to meet . and in both cases I ticked 35-45. Now we see the man she's talking to. It's NORMAN. He's
M	NORMAN	That's right, yes. So did I. They're at a speed dating evening. Numbered tables, etc.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Anyway, don't stop. Something
F	JUDITH	How old are you?
M	NORMAN	Early 40's.
F	JUDITH	D'you mean you were born in the early 40's?
M	NORMAN	Judy, I know what you're asking -
F	JUDITH	It's Judith.
M	NORMAN	Judith. And trust me, I've still got it. The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move I just can't find anyone that wants it. Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And
M	CRAIG	This is crazy. You're crazy. You can't just up and leave like this.
F	MADGE	And yet if you watch me, that's exactly what you'll see happen. She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's
M	JESSICA	What's going on?
M	CRAIG	Your mother's lost it.
M	JESSICA	My mother never had it.
M	CRAIG	Talk to her. She doesn't listen to me.
F	MADGE	Nobody listens to you. She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow. It's one of the great mysteries of life that someone so vibrant and fascinating as my daughter should choose to spend her life with this fraction of a man.
M	JESSICA	I still don't understand what's going on.
M	CRAIG	I just asked her to babysit. And now she says she's leaving. They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children,
M	JESSICA	But you love babysitting.
F	MADGE	I loved it last night.
M	LIAM	We had pizza and stayed up late.
F	MADGE	And the night before.
M	KATIE	We had Chinese and stayed up late.
M	LIAM	If you don't go, tonight we could do a curry.
F	MADGE	It's tempting, my darlings, but you know why I must leave.
M	LIAM	We know.
M	KATIE	Being here is stopping her finding a husband.
M	CRAIG	Another one?
M	LIAM AND KATIE	Bye Granny.
F	MADGE	Don't let the buggers get you down. Madge turns to go.
M	CRAIG	How many husbands have you had, anyway? She turns back, smiles.
F	MADGE	Including my own? Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi.
M	JESSICA	Mother? Mother!
M	TAXI DRIVER	Name the place, darling. Where are you going? Madge smiles.
F	MADGE	I have absolutely no idea.
M	CHRISTOPHER	There's no other way There just isn't. Harold told us this three months ago.
M	HAROLD	And I'm afraid matters have only got worse. 8A.
M	CHRISTOPHER	We can't wait any longer. We need to put this flat on the market, and at least make a start at paying off Dad's debts. Christopher turns to Harold.
M	CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)	I've talked it through with Polly and the boys, and of course we all agreed. Ma will move in with us.
M	HAROLD	I think that's best, Evelyn. It's what Hugh would've wanted. They wait for confirmation from Evelyn. None comes.
M	CHRISTOPHER	Good. Settled. End of discussion.
F	EVELYN	That's what your father used to say.
F	EVELYN	When there'd never really been any discussion at all.
M	CHRISTOPHER	I want to look after things for you.
F	EVELYN	Like he did for forty years
M	CHRISTOPHER	Yes.
F	EVELYN	And look how that turned out. She turns to Harold How can any of us know what Hugh would've wanted? And would he have seen fit to tell us anyway? Obviously the flat has to be sold. And you're very kind. And dear Polly. But no, I won't be coming to live with you.
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly. It's not a difficult operation.
F	MURIEL	Easy for you to say, you're not having it.
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	Regardless. You do need a new hip.
F	MURIEL	I'm not getting it from you.
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	Not me personally, no.
F	MURIEL	Not any of your lot.
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	I see.
F	MURIEL	So when do I have the operation?
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting list for at least six months.
F	MURIEL	At my age, I can't plan that far ahead. I don't even buy green bananas.
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	There is another way. Our hospital trust is funding a new pilot scheme, that will enable us to out-source you to another hospital, where they can perform the procedure almost immediately, and at a fraction of the cost.
F	MURIEL	Is it local?
M	DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR	That depends how you define local. Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full. When did you get a computer?
F	EVELYN	How far along is the progress bar? The strip at the bottom that tells you -
M	CHRISTOPHER	I know what it is. What are you showing me anyway? The webpage has come up. It's a picture of a beautiful old
M	MARIGOLD HOTEL'.	As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous
M	INDIAN VOICE	'Come and spend your autumn years in an Indian palace with the sophistication of an English country manor. Steeped in the tradition of the Raj, tucked away on the outskirts of Jaipur .'
M	INDIAN VOICE	it exudes historical ambience and is graced with breathtaking surroundings .' Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's. 'Lofty terraces, open courtyards, domes, arches and canopied balconies transport one back in time.'
M	ABI	I wouldn't mind going there myself. Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend
M	SIMON	There won't be any golf courses.
M	DOUGLAS	Just as well. I can't afford the green fees.
M	SIMON	But a retirement home? Douglas misses his putt.
M	DOUGLAS	It's a luxury development, where all the residents are in their golden years.
M	SIMON	Like the Costa Brava.
M	DOUGLAS	Yes. But with more elephants. Simon holes out.
M	GILES	How long have we known each other? And you've never once talked about India.
F	GRAHAM	D'you want these books?
M	GILES	You might need them again. Graham smiles at him, calls out.
F	GRAHAM	Mrs Megson! His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in.
M	MRS MEGSON	Sir? Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to
F	GRAHAM	I want you to have this.
M	MRS MEGSON	Are you sure?
F	GRAHAM	Absolutely. There's a slight crack on the bottom. But I think you might know something about that already. Mrs Megson goes.
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	I used to live there. A long time ago. Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old
M	NORMAN	I have to go. I do. And I could say I wish you'd come, but I've never lied to you. We both know I need more than you can offer. We know that. Don't we? We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Don't make that face at me. Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door.
M	MRS JELLINEK	You. Upstairs. The dog hops off the chair, and leaves. Norman watches him Any warm clothes you have use for no more, I take them. And not forget to leave keys when you go. She leaves. Norman is left alone.
M	NORMAN	I'll miss you too.
F	MURIEL	You know who'll be there, don't you? Indians. Loads of them, A sea of brown faces and black hearts, all greasy haired and reeking of spices. Never see one on their own, do you? No, becuase they hunt in packs. All the better to rob me blind and -
M	JACKSON	You know what? You can take it from here.
F	MURIEL	You're supposed to see me into my flat. That's what they said.
M	JACKSON	My wife is from Mumbai. He heads off. Muriel shouts after him.
F	MURIEL	No good moaning to me, mate. You married her! But he's gone. Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground.
M	CHRISTOPHER	You're sure your tickets are in order?
F	EVELYN	They should be. The hotel paid for them. I'm sure they'd rather have us there than not. And its fantastically cheap for the first three months.
M	CHRISTOPHER	I wonder why. They walk on in silence.
M	CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)	How will we know you're alright?
F	EVELYN	I'll call. They do have phones there, you know. Or you can just read my blog.
M	CHRISTOPHER	Your what?
F	EVELYN	On the interweb. You can log in whenever you like, read my news.
M	CHRISTOPHER	I just hope the first item will be announcing your return. I don't suppose they'll be paying for the journey back...? Evelyn stops. They've reached the terminal.
F	EVELYN	Could you please, before I go, say one thing that is supportive? Because I've never done anything like this before.
M	CHRISTOPHER	Without Dad, you never did anything at all. And i don't think you'll be able to cope.
F	EVELYN	Well. I suppose we'll find out, won't we? They head into the building.
F	MADGE	And the connecting flight to Jaipur is first class too? The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport.
M	MADGE (CONT'D)	I tell you, it's tough to get upgraded nowadays. I had to flirt so hard with the travel agent, it was practically phone sex. Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a
M	NORMAN	Come on. Thorough as you like Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt.
M	SECURITY GUARD	We'd like to take a look in this bag, Madam, if you don't mind. He lifts the bag onto a table. It's heavier than he What you got in here anyway? He opens the bag, stares in astonishment.
F	MURIEL	PG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars of Marmite. Thirty one packets of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled onions. Pickled eggs. And pickle.
M	SECURITY GUARD	No liquids on the plane.
F	MURIEL	What does that mean?
M	SECURITY GUARD	It means you can't take the pickled onions. Or the pickled eggs. The pickle's fine. Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs
F	JEAN	Obviously one's read one's Kipling, but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture, as well as making new friends. And a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for, isn't it Douglas?
M	DOUGLAS	I'm sorry? And is this your first time in India?
F	JEAN	You don't seem like an experienced traveller.
F	EVELYN	I'm not. Although one has read one's guidebooks. Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by
M	NORMAN	Norman Cousins.
F	MADGE	Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure.
M	NORMAN	Play your cards right, it could be. Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.
M	AIRPORT ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that owing to bad weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has been cancelled. The airline is happy to arrange After a moment, Graham says
F	GRAHAM	Alright. Plan B.
F	JEAN	Of course it's a good idea. Who can you trust if not a High Court Judge?
M	DOUGLAS	And this way we see more of the country. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.
M	NORMAN	If anyone asks, say you're my mother. I don't want people to think we're together.
F	MURIEL	In your dirty dreams.
F	JEAN	Douglas, these are not words that often pass my lips, but you may actually be right. The country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought. handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention. Graham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a
F	GRAHAM	The bus will drop us in the centre of town. We can take tuk- tuks the rest of the way! They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus.
F	MADGE	There's not enough room.
F	GRAHAM	It's time to prove the first and only rule of India: there's always room. He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the
F	EVELYN	What larks, Pip. Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles.
M	DOUGLAS	Let's hope so. The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream... At the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside
M	NORMAN	I'm loving this! Evelyn is sitting next to Madge.
F	EVELYN	A few months ago I was organising the church flowers.
F	MADGE	Are you struggling with the feeling you're not in control of your circumstances?
F	EVELYN	A little.
F	MADGE	You know what the shortest prayer in the world is?
F	EVELYN	No.
F	MADGE	Fuck it. Evelyn laughs. You're not doing the church flowers any more. May as well enjoy the ride. Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily.
F	JEAN	Are you insane? "Avoid all food not from a reputable vendor, it will have been washed with impure water." Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.
M	DOUGLAS	It's just a sandwich.
F	JEAN	Marvellous. Then I'll have the ham, cheese, and streptococcus, please. Or perhaps the bacteria, lettuce and tomato. Douglas turns to Muriel.
M	DOUGLAS	Would you like some of this? I believe it's aloo ka paratha.
F	MURIEL	If I can't pronounce it, I'm not eating it. The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder. But Evelyn
F	EVELYN	How long since you were here?
F	GRAHAM	Forty years.
F	EVELYN	As long as I was married. He died recently. My husband.
F	GRAHAM	I'm sorry.
F	EVELYN	D'you think we're going to be alright?
F	GRAHAM	God, don't ask me. I'm more scared than you are. They both smile, sit in silence for a bit.
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	Yes. I think it's going to be extraordinary.
M	EVELYN (O.S.)	What exactly is a tuk-tuk? A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races
M	SONNY	Welcome to India!!! They stare up at him. Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building,
M	SONNY	This is a building of the utmost character, which means that perhaps not everything will function in the way you expect it to. But as the manager and chief executive supervising officer of the Marigold Hotel, I can tell you with great pride that the building has stood for centuries, and will stand for many more, in 100% shipshape condition. Please follow me, carefully avoiding that naughty stone there round this corner, leading us most successfully all the way to . your bedroom! The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully
F	MADGE	Where?
M	SONNY	Here. In here.
F	MADGE	My dear man. Rooms have doors. What you're showing me here is an alcove.
M	SONNY	The door is coming soon, most definitely.
F	MADGE	How soon?
M	SONNY	Let us not concern ourselves with details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather than speaking of doors, we should instead take pleasure in the freedom to roam.
F	MADGE	Does your room have a door?
M	SONNY	Oh yes.
F	MADGE	Then that's where I'll be staying.
M	DOUGLAS	Bird in the room! Bird in the room! Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into
F	MURIEL	There's an Indian in there! Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but He looks around with satisfaction.
F	MURIEL	My what?
M	AJIT	Your physiotherapist. To help with your recovery after the operation.
F	MURIEL	You're not touching me.
M	AJIT	Traditionally that is how physiotherapy is practised. He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a
M	NORMAN	This'll do.
F	JEAN	I want to stay at the other hotel, the one in the brochure.
M	SONNY	Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be amazed. This is that very building!
F	JEAN	You've Photoshopped it!
M	SONNY	I have offered a vision of the future.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Of course I had hoped that by now it would be the present. But in India we have a saying: everything will be alright in the end. So if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end.
F	JEAN	What will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund.
M	SONNY	Of course if that is what you desire, you must have it. Absolutely no problem, I will refund you completely.
F	JEAN	You will? Straight away?
M	SONNY	Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I most definitely will. Straight away in three months. a stay of five days and it is done under general anaesthesia. A hip replacement usually takes only two hours
M	AJIT	Your surgeon will remove the top end of the thigh bone, and insert an artificial bone instead. A most routine procedure.
F	MURIEL	Have you got a marker pen on you?
M	AJIT	Why?
F	MURIEL	I want to mark it. So you don't take the wrong hip.
F	EVELYN	Oh, hello.
M	DOUGLAS	Is everything alright?
F	EVELYN	I was just going to find the manager.
M	DOUGLAS	I'm afraid he's dealing with my wife. Or vice versa.
F	EVELYN	I promised I'd call my son, to tell him I'd arrived, and -
M	DOUGLAS	And the phone in your room doesn't work. May I? Now, did you try jiggling it a bit?
F	EVELYN	Yes, did that.
M	DOUGLAS	Did you kind of bang it lightly on the desk a few times?
F	EVELYN	That too.
M	DOUGLAS	Hmm. He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the
F	EVELYN	How did you come to be here? In India.
M	DOUGLAS	I invested our - well, my - retirement money in our daughter's internet company. She assured me that as soon as the start-up actually started up, and the conversion from virtual to actual proved sufficiently viable, then she would be able to pay it all back.
F	EVELYN	I'm not sure I understand what most of those words mean.
M	DOUGLAS	It turns out neither did she. Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	There you are. Good as new.
F	EVELYN	Really?
M	DOUGLAS	No, of course not. I've got no idea what I'm doing. Evelyn bursts out laughing.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	Now, would you like me to not fix that chair? Because I can do that too.
M	SONNY (O.S.)	In honour of your arrival, a special welcome British roast for you all! Sonny is serving up a meal. His guests, wearing garlands
M	SONNY	.Cooked lovingly by myself and my most loyalist factotum and helper, Young Wasim ... He points to YOUNG WASIM. Who is about 80, and is sitting
F	MADGE	Roast what?
M	SONNY	A wonderful taste of Blighty.
F	MADGE	Roast what?
M	SONNY	Roast goat curry.
M	DOUGLAS	Yes please.
F	JEAN	So the upshot is that he's spent all our money getting us here, and we can't leave till he's made some more. Muriel has arrived at her table.
M	SONNY	Gentle friends, you have found your way to this place, bequeathed to me by my beloved father, that I have raised from the ruins of his broken dreams, and renamed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel For The Elderly And Beautiful. Yes, I use the words most deliberately... Norman is not looking very well at all. Sonny doesn't
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	.You have all heard the chimes at midnight, and long in tooth have youbecome. Who knowshow many daysyou have left?But we are mosthonoured that youhave chosen tospend that time with us. Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his General panic. Everybody crowds round, but no one knows
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Let me through, please. My brother is a doctor. He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels Everybody waits. And then This man is dead. An appalled silence.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Please, we must cover his face. We should preserve his dignity at this terrible moment. Madge looks around. All there is is a napkin. She passes
M	DOUGLAS	He just coughed. I heard him cough!
F	EVELYN	He moved! He's alive!
F	MADGE	He's fainted, that's all. Sonny shakes his watch next to his ear. It's stopped.
M	NORMAN	What's going on? Did I nod off? Everyone crowds round Norman, helps lift him back up.
F	MURIEL	Hell. I'm in hell.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Day Nine. Old habits die easier than we think, and new ones form.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	No longer do I reach out in the morning for Radio 4. My news comes instead from the Jaipur

M	EVELYN (V.0.)	This is a new and different world.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	The challenge is to cope with it.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	And not just cope ... but thrive. Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper.
F	EVELYN	Please, can anyone direct me to this address? Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	Thank you. She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, I don't . I don't really have much ... She gives them the contents of her pockets.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	Alright? Alright now? Goodbye. She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of
M	DOUGLAS	Graham was talking about this marvellous temple. I thought you might want to come with me.
F	JEAN	I'm your wife. Have we met?
M	DOUGLAS	You'd really rather stay here all day?
F	JEAN	Given the alternative, yes.
M	DOUGLAS	When I walk out in the morning, the street kids all smile at me.
F	JEAN	Because you give them money.
M	DOUGLAS	One does this trick where he holds his hands out in front of himself, and then swings through his own arms. Got to be worth a rupee or two. I'll go on my own then. Evelyn has somehow made it to the central reservation. She

F	GRAHAM	But there were houses all along here . these were homes.
M	PRAVESH	I can take you some other place..?
F	GRAHAM	No. That'll do for now. Thank you. He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away.

M	AJIT	It's strange. I think the more operations they perform, the luckier they get. He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting She pushes her way through the crowded market.

F	EVELYN	I'm so sorry. I didn't realise - She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry... A man is staring at her: SURESH.
M	SURESH	Yes.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to this address.
M	SURESH	Yes.
F	EVELYN	Do you understand me? Can you help me find this place?
M	SURESH	Yes.
F	EVELYN	Is that yes you understand, or yes you can help me?
M	SURESH	Yes. Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and
F	EVELYN	Let's go with both, shall we? A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half- It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for
M	SANJAY	Give me the ball. I can take him. He turns cheerily to Graham.
M	SANJAY (CONT'D)	Down is where you're going, Uncle.
F	GRAHAM	Come on. Do your worst. They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and
M	SANJAY	That's what I'm talking about! I felt the need, the need for - Graham still hasn't moved.
M	SANJAY (CONT'D)	Are you alright, Uncle? Graham finds his voice at last.
F	GRAHAM	Yes. Yes, I'm fine.
M	SURESH	Yes. Suresh helps Evelyn down off the back.
F	EVELYN	Thank you.
M	SURESH	Yes.
F	EVELYN	This is it?
M	SURESH	Yes.
F	EVELYN	Then thank you. You're very kind.
M	SURESH	Yes. He rides off. Evelyn looks nervously up at the building.
M	TELEMARKETERS	Thank you for talking to us today We do appreciate your call while I have you on the phone, can I talk to you about our special offers . your call is important to us . now is there anything else I can help you with ... shouldn't take more than five minutes . your custom is valuable to us
M	TELEMARRETERS (CONT'D)	I'm afraid I'll have to refer that to my supervisor just a routine security check before we start . Thank you for talking to us today Through a glass partition, Evelyn can be seen sitting at a
M	JAY	You're sure I can't offer you something? We have English Breakfast Tea. Building Tea, as you call it.
F	EVELYN	Builder's tea. It's called builder's tea. And no, I'm fine. Thank you.
M	JAY	Tell me then. How can I help you? Beat.
F	EVELYN	I don't think you can. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. She stands.
F	EVELYN	I saw your advertisement in the local paper, and it specifically mentioned the ability to talk to older people. But this is not what I imagined ...
M	JAY	You came for a job?
F	EVELYN	I've wasted your time.
M	JAY	Mrs Greenslade. Everyone working here is a graduate of a good university. This is a place for ambitious people. Young people.
F	EVELYN	I see that. Good day.
M	JAY	Please. One second. Evelyn stops.
M	JAY (CONT'D)	It is really builder's tea?
F	EVELYN	Yes. We dunk biscuits into it.
M	JAY	You dunk?
F	EVELYN	It means lowering a biscuit into your tea, letting it soak in there, then trying to calculate the exact moment just before it dissolves to whip it up to the mouth, and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined. It's more relaxing than it sounds.
M	JAY	Perhaps you can help us after all. One person watching is SUNAINA (20's). She's talking on
F	SUNAINA	We do appreciate your custom, which is very important to us. And can I draw your attention to our special - But the person at the other end has hung up. Sunaina Then the clock hits 11, and a buzzer sounds. Sunaina gets Sunaina, who is with some friends, spots him, comes over.
F	SUNAINA	I get two breaks in eight hours. Explain to me why I would want to waste one of them with you - He kisses her. She kisses him back.
M	SONNY	Leave this place. Come and work for me.
F	SUNAINA	You can't afford me.
M	SONNY	I cannot afford anything.
F	SUNAINA	Still tempting. I miss you. Am I coming round tonight?
M	SONNY	Let's meet somewhere else. I will rent a hotel room.
F	SUNAINA	Sonny, you own a hotel. It has many rooms.
M	SONNY	Some of them now occupied. With actual real guests.
F	SUNAINA	Paying guests?
M	SONNY	Why must you nitpick? It is not an attractive quality.
F	SUNAINA	It isn't? They kiss again, start to make out a bit. Then
M	JAY (O.S.)	Sunaina! They turn to see Jay who has come out of the Call Centre.
M	JAY (CONT'D)	You can let go of my sister now. Break's over.
M	SONNY	Hello Jay.
M	JAY	Sonny boy.
M	SONNY	Don't call me that. Jay smiles, holds the door open for Sunaina.
M	JAY	Let's go.
F	JEAN	Good evening, Your Honour.
F	GRAHAM	Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a good day. What did you get up to?
F	JEAN	Well, I started in my bedroom, where I had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names. Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn, I came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me. And how glad I am it was you.
F	GRAHAM	Why would you not go out? There's so much to see. Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All life is here, I tell you. Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into I could talk to the chef, if you like. Perhaps get you some grilled chicken, plain rice.
F	JEAN	I would appreciate that very much. Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet
F	GRAHAM	Good evening.
F	EVELYN	Good evening. Evelyn sits at her table.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	I trust you had a good day?
F	GRAHAM	I'd rather hear about yours.
F	EVELYN	I got a job. My first. Ever. I'm going to be a sort of cultural advisor.
F	GRAHAM	A role I'm sure you'll perform with great distinction. He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and
F	EVELYN	Perhaps if you wouldn't mind keeping that news to yourself.
F	GRAHAM	I'm flattered you shared it with me. He turns to greet the new arrivals.
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	Good evening, the Ainslies.
F	EVELYN	Have you had a good day?
M	DOUGLAS	Spectacular. I went to the temple you told me about. A place of meditation and peace, quite stunning.
F	JEAN	So spiritual, I bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung.
M	DOUGLAS	No elephants, sadly. Still none. I thought I might see you there. Where did you get to instead?
F	JEAN	Yes, where do you get to every day?
F	GRAHAM	Well, I've just finished telling Mrs Greenslade all about it. Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing.
F	JEAN	I'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again. She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.
F	GRAHAM	I talked to the chef for you. He said it will be no problem.
F	JEAN	Did you hear that, Douglas? Plain grilled food; manna from heaven.
M	DOUGLAS	I don't have to have it too, do I don't know how to thank you. You really should see this temple.
F	EVELYN	I'd like that very much.
M	DOUGLAS	But maybe take a clothes peg for your nose. Graham starts down the stairs.
F	EVELYN	Goodnight.
F	GRAHAM	Goodnight to you. He seems about to say something else. She waits for a
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	Mrs Greenslade?
F	EVELYN	Evelyn.
F	GRAHAM	Can I show you something?
F	GRAHAM	I grew up here. Just a short drive away. It was a big house, and we had servants, everyone did. We knew their wives, their children. One boy, Manoj, became my friend. We played a lot of cricket together, played anything we could. And that's how it stayed for years. Until one night, he became something more. We had a few months, we had that. There was a weekend in Udaipur, we sat by a lake and watched the sun go down, and I remember thinking . I will never be this happy again. And I was right. Because quite suddenly it was over. We'd fallen asleep, and they found us. For me it was bad enough. But I already knew who I was, and I think my family had guessed. For Manoj, the disgrace was absolute; a double taboo. His father was fired, they were sent away, all of them. I don't know what I could've done, but it should've been more than nothing. I put up no fight. I let it happen. Soon afterwards I went to England, to University. I always told myself I'd come back. But I never did.
F	EVELYN	Until now.
F	GRAHAM	And now I think .. what if I am the last person on earth he wants to see? Evelyn says nothing. I don't think I can go through with it.
F	EVELYN	Do you want to see him again?
F	GRAHAM	Yes. Yes. Oh yes.
F	EVELYN	Then you must. She looks up. Anokhi is on the verandah, replacing her Then she goes to fetch Muriel's jar of pickle from the Muriel watches, then wheels herself outside, looks at the From outside, Sonny's voicecan be heard.
M	SONNY (O.S.)	And so now that we are fully operational, Mr Maruthi, it is clear that with a small injection of funds for the Phase Two Development ...
M	SONNY	.. the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can rise like a phoenix to its previous state of glory. And when I say small injection, I mean small in the sense of medium- sized. Possibly larger.
M	MR MARUTHI	This hotel was never glorious.
M	SONNY	Just the phoenix part then.
M	MR MARUTHI	How many rooms will there be?
M	SONNY	Many.
M	MR MARUTHI	How many?
M	SONNY	A great amount. Plenty of rooms, no question. They've arrived in the courtyard.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	I am not a details man, Mr Maruthi.
M	MR MARUTHI	Nor was your father. They see Muriel on her verandah.
M	SONNY	Mr Maruthi, I present to you one of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs Donnelly, please describe in as much detail as you desire your experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
F	MURIEL	Kill me. Kill me now. Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks
M	SONNY	The wheel is spinning. But the hamster is dead. He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Mummyji! What are you doing here?
M	MRS KAPOOR	You called. I came.
M	SONNY	I couldn't have called. The phones don't work.
M	MRS KAPOOR	That's why I came.
M	MRS KAPOOR	Who was that man out there?
M	SONNY	The contents of this desk are mine. Don't open the drawers. I must insist you don't open the drawer. Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Tell me why you have come.
M	MRS KAPOOR	Do I need a reason to visit my favourite son?
M	SONNY	No. He is in his mansion in Delhi.
M	MRS KAPOOR	My second favourite.
M	SONNY	He went to Kerala to make his fortune.
M	MRS KAPOOR	But make it, he did.
M	SONNY	As I will make mine. I have a dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant one: to out-source old age. And not just for the British. There are many other countries where they don't like old people too.
M	MRS KAPOOR	Your brothers own a third of the hotel each, they are entitled to a third of the profits.
M	SONNY	Success does not happen overnight, Mummyji. This is blue sky thinking, and it requires long-term strategy and patience.
M	MRS KAPOOR	How is your girlfriend?
M	SONNY	I look forward to you meeting her.
M	MRS KAPOOR	And I look forward to you meeting the woman you will marry. She is from a good family in Delhi.
M	SONNY	I can marry as I choose, Mummyji. I need no permission.
M	MRS KAPOOR	I presume it is your girlfriend who teaches you such nonsense. One reason not to marry her.
M	SONNY	What if I love her?
M	MRS KAPOOR	An even better reason. Now send Young Wasim to the car for my luggage.
M	SONNY	He cannot carry, he has a dicky back ... wait, your luggage? How long are you staying?
M	MRS KAPOOR	As long as it takes. Jean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to
F	MURIEL	You won't get the dirt out like that. Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly. I worked in service for years, looked after a lovely house. I kept it spotless. You need a bit more pressure on that brush. Graham walks past, on his way out.
F	GRAHAM	She won't speak English. She's what used to be called an Untouchable. An outcast, born below society. To a good Hindu, even her shadow is polluted. He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.
F	MURIEL	Where d'you go every day? Is it a woman? Nip round there for a curry and a bit of afters?
F	GRAHAM	I don't think so. I'm gay. Although nowadays more in theory than practice. Good day. He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out.
F	JEAN	Good morning. Muriel says nothing.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	Lovely day. Still nothing from Muriel.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	Lovely. Lovely. She turns and goes back in. Muriel thinks for a while, then turns to Anokhi.
F	MURIEL	Long old life, isn't it? Madge is being shown around by an elderly secretary, MR
M	MR DRARUNA	The Viceroy Club was opened by the great Lord Kitchener himself, and many of the fixtures have remained unchanged since then.
F	MADGE	Yes, I see that. Perhaps you could tell me a little about the clientele? Any maharajahs? Wealthy widowed land-owners?
M	MR DHARUNA	It is not the policy of this club to divulge details of our members. They go past a very handsome older Indian man. Who Good morning, Your Excellency.
F	MADGE	Where do I sign up?
M	MR DHARUNA	The admission fee is 120,000 rupees, and thereafter 15,000 rupees each month.
F	MADGE	I wonder if I might get a little discount. Owing to my status.
M	MR DHARUNA	Your status, madam?
F	MADGE	Yes. One was rather hoping to fly under the radar, but one is a member of the Royal Family.
M	MR DHARUNA	Which member, madam?
F	MADGE	I'm Princess Margaret. It is most surely an honour to meet you. And may I say how well you look. Especially taking into account that you died nine years ago. Your real name please, madam. And 120,000 rupees.
F	GRAHAM	Good morning.
M	MR CHIDAMBRAM	Good morning, Sir. Did I not say that we will contact you when there is information regarding your inquiry?
F	GRAHAM	Yes, you did say that. You did.
M	MR CHIDAMBRAM	While it is most pleasant to see you, your presence does not actually accelerate our investigation.
F	GRAHAM	I'll try not to come in tomorrow.
M	MR CHIDAMBRAM	I expect I will see you then.
F	EVELYN	.You ring in the morning. Let's assume the person answering will be a woman. She will have had her breakfast. Tea or coffee. Semi-skimmed milk, always. If she's under 50 she'll be contemplating yet another diet, over 50 she'll have more or less given up, and be eating toast. The radio may be playing, or more likely daytime TV. A chat show, or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers. The girlfriends' mothers, I mean, not their own. Although Anyway, then the boyfriends usually come out, and everybody fights. Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.
F	SUNAINA	I'm not surprised people hang up on us. Laughter.
F	EVELYN	That's the point. When the phone rings and it's this robot nobody wants a machine, but it's almost worse when it's a person behaving like one. All these sales cliches just strung together. 'Your call is important to us'. Is it? Well then sound like it.
F	SUNAINA	'Your custom is valuable'.
F	EVELYN	Right. That one. Don't ever say that.
F	SUNAINA	'Service is our middle name'.
F	EVELYN	Yes, when your middle name is
F	SUNAINA	Shantanu.
F	EVELYN	Which is beautiful. You people are young, vibrant, real. I'm sure the typical housewife would enjoy talking to each and every one of you.
F	SUNAINA	Her morning sounds like fun. What are you doing here? Beat.
F	EVELYN	I suppose I'm not typical anymore. Is that the sort of thing?
F	MADGE	Excuse me. Would there be any wealthy single men in tonight?
M	BARMAN	There is one. Madge puts some money into his breast pocket.
F	MADGE	Perhaps you could seat me next to him?
M	BARMAN	This way, madam. He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows, The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's
M	BARMAN (CONT'D)	His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent. The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's
F	MADGE	I'll have that back, thank you very much.
F	GRAHAM	Good evening. Muriel nods at him, and he goes on into his room.
F	JEAN	You know where he goes. I know you know. But you won't tell me. Muriel says nothing.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	I can get Hobnobs out here, you know. I know a way. As many as you want. Milk or plain. Long pause.
F	MURIEL	Public Records Office.
F	JEAN	Thank you. Young couples sit on the steps in the evening heat, boys Sonny and Sunaina are watching the swimmers.
M	SONNY	My father used to bring me to this well to swim. He said the water was better, and so were the people we would meet. He would have liked you so much. Sunaina smiles at this.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	My mother doesn't want us to be married.
F	SUNAINA	She hasn't met me yet.
M	SONNY	Sunaina absorbs this.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	She knows you are not from Delhi. That you have no family money, and work in a call centre. You are a part of a new India she cannot welcome.
F	SUNAINA	Isn't this where you tell her what you want?
M	SONNY	That conversation will be easier when the hotel is a success.
M	SUNANINA	Do you love me?
M	SONNY	I have found a new investor. I am most optimistic that he will enable us to move forward with Phase Two of the Marigold Hotel
M	SUNANINA	Shouldn't you finish Phase One first?
M	SONNY	In business, if you stand still, you move backwards. No, I have that wrong. If you stand still, you are overtaken by people going the other way. Wait -
F	SUNAINA	You didn't answer the question. Do you love me?
M	SONNY	My feelings for you cannot be reduced to a single word.
F	SUNAINA	It's a nice word, Sonny. And people like hearing it.
M	SONNY	Sunaina, please. My mother is wrong. It is you who are too good for me.
M	SUNANINA	You say that a lot. You shouldn't I'll start to believe you. They watch the boys in the water.
M	NORMAN	I still think you're cramping my style.
F	MADGE	Please. You have no style to cramp. 58A.
M	NORMAN	That lady at the bar keeps looking at me.
F	MADGE	As one would something in a museum.
M	NORMAN	Why must you mock? I just want to feel young again, to be needed as much as I need, if only for one night, one wonderful night. Tell me you don't know how that feels. Silence for a bit.
F	MADGE	Give me a minute. Then join us. She gets up, heads towards the bar. Where she sits a
M	MADGE (CONT'D)	Rejected again. Many years ago, that man over there gave me the most extraordinary night of my life. He may seem coarse and uncouth, but that only disguises a tenderness and an exquisite sensitivity to a woman's needs Norman arrives at the bar.
M	NORMAN	Those drinks not ready yet? Madge turns to Carol.
F	MADGE	They say patience is passion tamed. Carol smiles.
M	MADGE (CONT'D)	I'm Madge.
F	CAROL	Carol.
F	MADGE	And this . is Norman.
F	CAROL	How do you do?
M	NORMAN	Carol? As in Christmas? Madge winces.
F	CAROL	I suppose.
M	NORMAN	Great. Silence.
F	MADGE	So what brings you to Jaipur, Carol?
M	NORMAN	Yes, Carol. What brings you to Jaipur?
F	CAROL	I run a small boutique travel agency. But I've actually lived here all my life. My father worked in the Foreign Office. Another silence.
M	NORMAN	You're very fit.
F	CAROL	I beg your pardon?
F	MADGE	Oh god.
M	NORMAN	I mean you look like you keep yourself in shape. Physically.
F	CAROL	Well, I did join a gym last year. It cost a fortune, and I didn't get any fitter. Apparently you have to actually go. Madge laughs. Norman doesn't. Then realizes that it was a
M	CAROL (CONT'D)	And so what do you do, Norman?
M	NORMAN	Me?
F	CAROL	Yes.
M	NORMAN	Oh. I'm
F	MADGE	Norman's in business.
F	CAROL	Really?
M	NORMAN	Yes.
F	CAROL	What business? You tell her.
F	MADGE	Import-Export.
M	NORMAN	Although these days there's rather more Ex- than Im-, if you see what I mean.
F	CAROL	I'm afraid I don't. Madge gets up.
F	MADGE	I have to splash some water on my face. Please God I drown in it. She heads for the bathroom. Norman and Carol share another silence.
F	CAROL	Well look, it's been lovely chatting.
M	NORMAN	No it hasn't.
F	CAROL	No. It hasn't. But I really
M	NORMAN	Carol? She was about to go, stops.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Can we drop all this pretence? And start again? I'm not charming. I'm not good at repartee. And I'm not a plutocrat with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino. My name is Norman. And I'm lonely.
F	CAROL	My name is Carol. So am I.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Day 22. Like Darwin's finches, we are slowly adapting to our environment. And when one does adapt, my god, the riches that are available. Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	There is no past that we can bring back by longing for it
F	EVELYN	. only a present that builds and creates itself as the past withdraws ...
F	EVELYN	And India, like so many things in life, like life itself I suppose, is about what you bring to it.
F	MURIEL	Where's this? Where are we?
M	AJIT	Janta Colony Kachi Basti.
F	MURIEL	What happened to my usual route?
M	AJIT	Anokhi has invited you to her home.
F	MURIEL	You didn't tell me.
M	AJIT	You'd have said no.
F	JEAN	Will you check in at the bank? Douglas emerges from the bathroom.
M	DOUGLAS	I checked yesterday. And the day before. As requested. Will you be staying in again?
F	JEAN	Why do you ask that every morning?
M	DOUGLAS	Because I hope for a different answer. Because I think you'll be hurt if I don't. And because it's not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel. He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject.
F	JEAN	I didn't sleep a wink. The tap in there never stops dripping.
M	DOUGLAS (O.S.)	I talked to Young Wasim about it.
F	JEAN	What did he say? No idea. It was in Hindi. Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	I thought I might get it fixed myself. 63A.
M	DOUGLAS	No time like the present. Actually I say that, but I enjoyed yesterday, and I'm optimistic about tomorrow too.
F	JEAN	I wish I could say the same.
M	DOUGLAS	So do I. He goes. Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and
M	NORMAN	Your Madgesty.
F	MADGE	I gather the night went well.
M	NORMAN	Would you like to hear about it?
F	MADGE	Not in the least.
M	NORMAN	Good. Because you're going to. Two drinks, some sexually charged Douglas comes out, carrying a tap. And heads out of the
M	DOUGLAS	Morning. Lovely day.
F	MADGE	Good morning. They watch him leave.
M	NORMAN	Two drinks, some sexually charged banter, and we were heading back to her place. Bidding the rickshaw farewell, I walked her to the door. And there, my young friend, I leaned forward, and I kissed her. Beat.
F	MADGE	And?
M	NORMAN	And what?
F	MADGE	Is that all? You didn't seal the deal?
M	NORMAN	We have a date next week.
F	MADGE	What is wrong with you?
M	NORMAN	I wanted to prolong the anticipation. To spend some time with the knowledge that soon I'm going to eat, drink, and laugh with someone, hold her to me, kiss her softly. Then go back to her place and get my end away.
F	EVELYN	Bow much for this, please Kitna
M	AKRAM	One thousand rupees Ek hazaar
F	EVELYN	Thank you. She reaches for her wallet. Then Douglas speaks from
M	DOUGLAS	No no, forgive me. That's not how it works.
M	65A.	Evelyn turns, happy to see him.
F	EVELYN	Good morning.
M	DOUGLAS	And to you. Sorry to butt in, but you don't ask him how much he wants, you just tell him how much you'll pay. She'll give you two hundred. Absolutely no more, final offer.
M	AKRAM	One thousand rupees.
M	DOUGLAS	Pity. Now walk away. Walk away.
M	DOUGLAS	I know what I'm doing. Evelyn complies, and they turn and walk away.
F	EVELYN	Yes. The thing is, you see, I did actually want to buy that. To brighten up my room.
M	DOUGLAS	He'll come after us.
F	EVELYN	Do you think so?
M	DOUGLAS	Absolutely. This is how the game is played. Just keep on walking. They push through the crowds.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	He's playing it cool, but he'll come. They keep walking.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	He's playing it very cool. They keep walking. Then Douglas stops. Evelyn looks at
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	He's not coming. Moments later. They're back at Akram's stall. Evelyn
F	EVELYN	Eight hundred and fifty, nine hundred, nine hundred and fifty, one thousand. She turns to Douglas, smiles.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	You'll get him next time. Then she notices something.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	Why are you carrying a tap? Then stands. Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph - A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit.
F	MURIEL	How soon can I leave?
M	DOUGLAS	You see what I think, and of course I'm no expert, is that the valve seat has eroded, so we'll need the washer changed and a new seat re-ground. Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the Jamshed studies the tap.
M	JAMSHED	The gland nut has come away from the spindle.
M	DOUGLAS	Well of course, it could be that too. Can you fix it?
M	JAMSHED	Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most expensively indeed. Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts
M	DOUGLAS	I was in a tuk-tuk the other day, didn't seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel. It turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel, that he was sure I would prefer. And of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart, and that it wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	One wants to trust, in general, don't you think? But you never really know, do you? Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to
F	EVELYN	The day I met my husband was the day the fair came to town. My girlfriend and I went on the carousel. Her horse was fine. But when the ride began I felt mine give a little, like it might collapse. Then these strong arms were around me, holding the horse together. And a voice in my ear said "Just trust me". And I did. Without question. Until the day he died.
M	DOUGLAS	How wonderful.
F	EVELYN	The sale of our flat went through last week. I had to sell it to pay off Hugh's debts. I've been forced to get a job out here. Which, in fact, I love. But even at Sonny's rates, I still couldn't make ends meet. After what my own husband did to our life savings. So no. You're right. You never know. Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts.
M	JAMSHED	No good. You must be buying another. Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace, Anokhi speaks. Ajit translates.
M	AJIT	She wants to thank you for your kindness.
F	MURIEL	I haven't been kind.
M	AJIT	You're the only one that acknowledges her. Anokhi brings out a plate of food.
F	ANOKHI	Tarkha dhal. Chapati.
F	MURIEL	I'm not eating that.
M	AJIT	You will insult her very deeply if you do not. Muriel looks up. They're all still watching, waiting She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is Muriel reaches out, takes something off the tray. And has
F	MURIEL	I'd still rather a Scotch Egg. Then she sees something through the open doorway: the She's on her feet in a flash.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	Get off! Get off it, you dirty thieving bastards! Several terrified faces turn. One little girl starts to cry. Everyone is staring at Muriel.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	I didn't see. They were playing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry The corridors are full of people patiently waiting their Reaching the top of the staircase, Jean takes it all in. In the office.
F	GRAHAM	But I've filled out that form. I've given it to you. Many times.
M	MR CHIDAMBRAM	There is a process. You are making an enquiry. For each enquiry a form must be filled in.
F	GRAHAM	But it's the same enquiry I make every day.
M	MR CHIDAMBRAM	And therefore the same form you must fill in. Graham glances towards the doorway, catches sight of Jean.
F	GRAHAM	Mrs Ainslie... .?
F	JEAN	I don't know how you can bear this country. What do you see that I don't?
F	GRAHAM	Unutterable beauty. Everywhere. In the light, the colours, the smiles, the people who see life as a privilege not a right, and so teach me something every day. The waiter brings their tea.
F	JEAN	Is this milk pasteurized?
M	WAITER	Yes madam.
F	JEAN	But that's not true, is it? You're just lying to me right now
F	GRAHAM	It'll be fine. The waiter goes.
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	It's a pleasant surprise to see you out and about.
F	JEAN	Is it? She looks at him.
F	GRAHAM	Yes. That's progress. Where were you going?
F	JEAN	To the bank. I . was going to the bank. Not that there's any reason to think something has changed. But our daughter, you see, she did promise, and one does try to remain optimistic. One has to. Otherwise
M	OTHERWISE	Graham worries she might be about to break down. He Graham is startled. He tries gently to pull back, but she
F	JEAN	Oh god. Is it possible you feel the same? She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	The way you talk to me. Your compassion, your understanding .. the wonderful, tender consideration, it had to be more than just -
F	GRAHAM	I'm gay. She stares at him. Beat.
F	JEAN	As in ... happy? Graham says nothing. Jean lets go of his hand.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	Yes. I see. Of course I see. The ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	I appear to have humiliated myself. And embarrassed you.
F	GRAHAM	I'm not embarrassed. Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie.
F	JEAN	Like I said. This country is driving me mad. Shall we go?
F	EVELYN	Anything?
M	DOUGLAS (O.S.)	Not yet. Evelyn waits a moment.
F	EVELYN	How about now?
M	DOUGLAS (O.S.)	One second. Another pause. Oh good lord.
F	EVELYN	What?
M	DOUGLAS (O.S.)	Listen. The sound of a flowing tap. And now ... The tap stops. No drip. He appears in the doorway, triumphant.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	No drip! He walks towards her, hand in the air.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	Hi-five ! Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in After a moment Douglas puts his hand down.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	I've never done that before. It just seemed appropriate. Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	Darling!
F	EVELYN	Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did you have a good day? Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks
M	DOUGLAS	Let me tell you about ours. Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to - We have to get out of here. What did you say?
F	JEAN	I can't stay in this country a moment longer.
M	DOUGLAS	Why ...?
F	EVELYN	Do excuse me. She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into
M	DOUGLAS	I don't understand Pick a reason. Pick ten. The climate, the squalor, the poverty She goes past him into their room.
F	JEAN	. we should never have come. This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy. It's time to go home. Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively.
M	DOUGLAS	Who's paying for the tickets?
F	JEAN	Look at us. A group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year. Humiliating ourselves
M	DOUGLAS	Not us, we can't pay. And I don't see you asking our friends .. We should just face up to the truth. That we're all old, we're all past it. That's the real truth, the raw, unvarnished fact of the matter. All we're good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner ... She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying Nobody speaks for a while. We just have to make the best of it, darling. I really think that's the best thing to do.
F	JEAN	Yes, well. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. Norman is sitting there, the only man in three rows of DR RAMA comes out of the consulting area.
M	DR RAMA	Mr John Smith. No response. The doctor looks at Norman, who has forgotten Mr John Smith? Norman jumps up.
M	NORMAN	That's right! Me!
M	SONNY	Come on. Pick up pick up pick up. The phone is answered at the other end. Sunaina, I must see you. I must. If I cannot hold your body against mine, I swear I will go mad. We cut to the call centre. It's not Sunaina on the phone, I yearn for you, I burn for you,
M	JAY	I think it's my sister you're burning for there, Sonny boy.
M	SONNY	Thank you, Jay. Thank you. Jay hands the phone to Sunaina.
F	SUNAINA	Hey.
M	SONNY	Private line, Sunaina. Do those words mean nothing to you?
F	SUNAINA	He took the phone. What could I do?
M	SONNY	I miss you. I miss you every moment. Come and see me. Tonight.
F	SUNAINA	I cannot tonight. It is my parents 25th wedding anniversary. Tell your mother that.
M	SONNY	Come after. Come late
M	SUNANINA	You'll be asleep.
M	SONNY	I'll be waiting.
M	SUNANINA	You'll be asleep. But i can wake you in that special way...
M	SONNY	You will sneak in?
F	SUNAINA	I'm not ashamed.
M	SONNY	Neither am I. Absolutely not. There is no shame. You do not have to sneak. All the same, if you did want to be very quiet, and not let anyone see you, it couldn't hurt.
M	NORMAN	I'm worried there's no lead in my pencil.
M	DR RAMA	OK. I don't know what that means.
M	NORMAN	No snap in my celery.
M	DR RAMA	I'm still not quite with you.
M	NORMAN	I plan to party hearty tonight, but I can't guarantee that my love gun will fire.
M	DR RAMA	Mr Smith -
M	NORMAN	Will the lance dance, and the trouser lion roar?
M	DR RAMA	What is your problem?
M	NORMAN	I don't know if I can still have sex.
M	DR RAMA	Ah.
M	NORMAN	I'm not a young man anymore, doctor. And I'm a little bit scared. Truth be told, I'm a lot scared.
M	DR RAMA	How long since you've been with a woman?
M	NORMAN	What's today?
M	DR RAMA	Monday.
M	NORMAN	Six years.
M	DR RAMA	I've got some pills that'll help. Anokhi is cleaning pots. Young Wasim sits in the corner. I wanted to tell you something... Anokhi looks up. Tell her. Tell her I was glad to come, glad she invited me. Ajit translates.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	Glad to meet her family. Her grandmother. Her kids. Ajit translates. Anokhi speaks.
M	AJIT	She asks if you have children?
F	MURIEL	I looked after somebody else's. Ajit translates. This one family, years I was with them. I ran the house, looked after the money, did it all, cared for them like they were my own. Ajit starts to translate. But Muriel doesn't wait.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	That's the mistake, see. You don't want to get like that, to start feeling part of something. One day they decided I needed some help. I was grateful, I tried to teach her. Not just the books, but how to crisp up the bacon like the gentleman preferred it, the way the little one liked to have her hair brushed. The things you only know if you care. But then they said I was no longer useful to them. Thanked me for my service. As if that's all it was. I got a flat in the end. I'm the only one in the building not a foreigner. More Indians there than here! But before I came to this place, my biggest problem was what to do with all the time I had. Because that flat's so small, I can have the whole place spotless in half an hour. And then what am I supposed to do for the rest of the day? There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks.
M	AJIT	Did you want me translate that as well? Muriel smiles. It's the first time we've seen this.
F	MURIEL	Give her these. Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries Over this, the sound of singing Norman is naked, and singing along lustily.
M	NORMAN	Aaaaaah, freak out! Le freak, c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out! Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts
F	EVELYN	I've been getting out and about as much as I can, but I feel I've hardly scratched the surface. And of course I'd love to see Udaipur. The lake you talked about.
F	GRAHAM	I'd love to take you. Perhaps - He breaks off. Douglas and Jean have come in. Jean looks Good evening.
M	81A.	An awkward moment. Graham stands.
F	GRAHAM	Good evening, Mrs Ainslie. Please allow me. He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of
F	JEAN	You're very kind. But I rather think I'll turn in early. Goodnight everyone. She goes into her room.
F	MADGE	Is this it?
M	NORMAN	This is it.
F	MADGE	You're not worried about the danger of having sex at your age? Norman shrugs.
M	NORMAN	If she dies, she dies. He leaves. Sonny sprints into the courtyard.
M	SONNY	Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Hardcastle! The wheel is turning most assuredly in our favour! He shoots up the stairs.
M	SONNY	Mr Dashwood! Everybody! Great news!
F	GRAHAM	What is it, Sonny?
M	SONNY	They are working, they are working!
F	GRAHAM	That is great news. What are working?
M	SONNY	The telephones of the Marigold Hotel.
F	GRAHAM	Well, congratulations.
M	SONNY	Thank you. I must tell everybody. I must tell my mother! He runs off. Comes back.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Oh wait. You have a phone call.
F	GRAHAM	It's a false alarm. There's no way they could find anything in that office. They probably just picked an address at random, just to keep me off their backs. I'm sure that's what happened. It's going to be nothing. Don't you think it's going to be nothing?
F	EVELYN	I think you should knock on the door and see.
F	GRAHAM	Yes. Yes I should. Yes. Across the street, Graham approaches a house. At a polite A woman, GAURIKA, appears. She stares at Graham.
F	GRAHAM	I'm sorry to disturb you so late. My name is Graham Dashwood. A long time ago I -
F	GAURIKA	I know who you are. Beat.
F	GRAHAM	I am afraid I don't know you.
F	GAURIKA	I am Gaurika. The wife of Manoj.
F	GRAHAM	I'm very pleased to meet you. And if you could, if you would tell him that I called around, I'd appreciate that very much, He breaks off. She's walked past him, looking to the other He turns to look at the men playing cards. Gaurika calls in A beautiful-looking man looks up. MANOJ. Graham reaches him. The two men just stand there for a From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches. Across the street, Manoj and Graham are still holding each
M	DOUGLAS	
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	First time going in to London with my dad, on his commute... He'd always been so extraordinary to me, so unique. But there he was standing on the station platform, utterly indistinguishable from all the other men in suits. And then of course a few years later I was one of them... Hated my job. Hated it. Sorry, talking too much. Blame a good dinner out.
F	EVELYN	What was she thinking?
M	DOUGLAS	I beg your pardon?
F	EVELYN	His wife. Manoj's wife. She knew who Graham was. Had he told her? D'you think we'll find out tomorrow?
M	DOUGLAS	Not me, I'm heading up to the Badi Mahal Palace. Very excited, been reading all about it.
F	EVELYN	Tell me.
M	DOUGLAS	I would, if I could remember a word. Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding
M	WAITER	Come, please. Nice meal, please... We've eaten, thank you... They continue on their way. Slightly further apart than Sunaina parks her bike outside the hotel, goes on in. She takes off her clothes. And climbs, naked, into bed In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up. Who couldn't be happier.
F	MADGE	A midnight booty call. How utterly marvellous.
F	SUNAINA	I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I don't know what your name is, but I'm incredibly sorry.
F	MADGE	Don't be. Most action I've had in weeks.
F	SUNAINA	If you could just please not Sonny bursts in.
M	SONNY	Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle! I can explain each and every thing! Hesees Sunaina.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Oh my god you are naked. He turns to Madge.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Mrs Hardcastle, I must apologise with deep and profound sincerity -
F	SUNAINA	How could you not tell me you weren't in your room!
M	SONNY	Yes, Sunaina, to you too I must apologise with equally deep and profound sincerity. Now go. Get out. Quickly.
F	SUNAINA	I'm going. Just let me get dressed, and -
M	SONNY	No no, quicker than that. You must leave, before - MrsKapoor flings open the door.
M	MRS KAPOOR	What is going on here? Who screamed? She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina. No no no no no. No! This is a respectable hotel, not a brothel. You, get out. And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected better of you. Actually, this is exactly what I expected of you, but nevertheless -
F	SUNAINA	Mrs Kapoor, I'm Sunaina.
M	MRS KAPOOR	Since I will not be paying for your services, your name is of no interest to me. How do you know mine? Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know
M	SONNY	Because this . is my Sunaina.
M	MRS KAPOOR	The girl who my son described as not too modern.
F	MADGE	This is getting interesting. Tell me, please. Is there anyone in this building you haven't slept with?
M	SONNY	Mummyji, do not get the wrong idea. Sunaina was not here to be with Mrs Hardcastle. She was here to have sex with me! Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina. Who is speechless.
M	MRS KAPOOR	This is the sort of woman you are. OK. Each to her own. But do not ever try and tell me that you are suitable wife for my son. Find your clothes and go. I don't expect to see you again.
F	EVELYN	Sunaina? And now Sunaina is even more humiliated. One trader is unloading some fruit. A few guava roll off Someone picks them up for him. It's Graham, who smiles as How did it go? Norman turns, to see Graham standing above him.
M	NORMAN	I have seen the top of the mountain. And it is good. Graham nods, sits down next to him. They gaze out at the
F	GRAHAM	I saw someone yesterday, a man I hadn't seen for many years. A man I've loved all my life. Norman is a bit startled by this.
M	NORMAN	A man... .?
F	GRAHAM	Yes.
M	NORMAN	Carry on.
F	GRAHAM	I didn't know how he'd been in the meantime, didn't want to guess. I brought disgrace upon him and his family, and imagined he might hate me for it. But we talked all night. He's been happy. He's led a peaceful life, married to a woman who understood him and loved him nonetheless. But he's never forgotten me. That's what he said. I asked his forgiveness anyway. He said he had nothing to forgive me for. That instead I should forgive myself. All that time. All that time I believed I'd sentenced him to a life of shame. When I was the one in prison. But not any more. Silence for a while.
M	NORMAN	Top of the mountain.
F	GRAHAM	Yes. Norman smiles, then stands and goes on inside.
M	GRAHAM (CONT'D)	Not any more.
F	MADGE	How was the night?
M	NORMAN	Rather special. He leaves. Madge just stares after him. Then it opens its huge wings, takes off. And flies up into You're back. He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	It's been rather an extraordinary night all round. First tell me your news, and then - She breaks off. Graham is dead.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Day 45. Of course it was inevitable. Put enough old people in the same place, it won't be too long before one of them goes... Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and sobered
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	We all know it'll happen, but few of us know when. Graham died of a heart attack, evidently not his first. So he had a better idea than most what was coming, he just neglected to tell us. His prerogative.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	There was talk of sending the body home, but Manoj felt he should have a Hindu burial. At the place they had visited together. Not a holy place. Although for them perhaps it was. Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	A body takes a long time to be consumed. Many hours for the mourners to remember their dead. The fire must be lit at dawn, and by sunset, there must be nothing left but ash.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Where do our souls go? is that all of us that is left behind? Perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off, we do so knowing that we were loved Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and
F	MURIEL	So there's a process, they call it pickling. I have no idea what it is, or how they do it, but whoever invented it was a smart man. But the real genius was the one who introduced an onion into the system. That I could never have thought of. Ajit looks at her, ready to translate.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	No, forget it. Muriel is looking out at the yard. She sees Mrs Kapoor, Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them.
M	MRS KAPOOR	Mrs Donnelly, what are you doing here? You should not be here, talking with this one.
F	MURIEL	I'm helping her clean. If these pots get any dirtier, you'll have to serve the food with penicillin.
M	MRS KAPOOR	We have other rooms. Go to one of them instead. While this is still a hotel. She turns back to the surveyors. What's her problem? What's happening here? Ajit can't answer. But he knows a man who can. He points to Young Wasim.
M	AJIT	He can tell you.
M	EVENING	A stunning view over the city. Madge is having a drink
F	MADGE	When someone dies, you think about your own life. And in my case, there is less of it in front of me than behind. And I don't want to grow older. I don't want to be condescended to, ignored and marginalised by society. To become peripheral to the action. I don't want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis. They laugh together. And don't even see Douglas go.
M	DOUGLAS	I wondered where you'd been. Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	We're all up top, having a drink.
F	EVELYN	I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's wife. I wanted to ask her what she knew. And the answer was that she knew everything, that he'd loved another man, and always would. He told her when the marriage was arranged. They had no secrets from each other, none. Suddenly she's crying. Unable to stop.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	And that's right, don't you see? That must be right. Because what is the point of a marriage in which nothing is shared? Her words hang in the air. They stand there for a moment.
F	JEAN	Mrs Greenslade, might I have my husband back now? They spring apart. Douglas? She walks off back into the room. Douglas turns to Evelyn.
F	EVELYN	Yes, of course.
M	DOUGLAS	Forgive me. Evelyn goes quickly to her room, leaving him standing
M	DOUGLAS	She was upset.
F	JEAN	Spare me your explanations. D'you think I'm jealous?
M	DOUGLAS	I don't see why else you would have embarrassed me. And Evelyn.
F	JEAN	You were already doing a perfectly good job of embarrassing yourself. Can you imagine how ghastly it's been for everyone to watch you mooning around after that simpering doe- eyed ex-housewife, taking advantage of her loneliness and -
M	DOUGLAS	God, can you hear yourself? Can you? Do you have any idea what a terrible person you've become? Jean is stunned into silence.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	All you give out is this endless negativity, a refusal to see any kind of light and joy even when it's right in your face, and a desperate need to squash any sign of happiness in me or anyone else .. it's a wonder I don't fling myself at the first kind word or gesture that comes my way. But I don't. Out of some dried-out notion of loyalty and respect, neither of which I ever bloody get in return. There's a long silence.
F	JEAN	I checked my emails. This came. She hands him a piece of paper.
F	MADGE	Are you alright?
F	EVELYN	I just need some water. She drains the glass.
F	MADGE	That was a gin and tonic.
F	EVELYN	Yes. I know that now.
F	MADGE	What's happened?
M	NORMAN	Good evening, the Ainslies. Douglas and Jean are approaching them.
F	MADGE	How are you both?
F	JEAN	We're particularly well. Douglas, tell them our news. She looks to him, waits. He says nothing.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	We're going home.
M	SONNY	And so I would ask you to loosen the strings on your purse, Mr Maruthi, and to do it most rapidly. So that Phase Two Development of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can begin with immediate effect. Mr Maruthi looks down, sees Muriel. She's with Anokhi, He calls down to her.
M	MR MARUTHI	Mrs Donnelly, I believe. Sonny spots the danger, tries to lead Mr Maruthi away.
M	SONNY	And now if you would please be following me to the ground floor
M	ROOMS	Mr Maruthi ignores him, calls down again.
M	MR MARUTHI	How are things at the hotel?
M	SONNY	Mr Maruthi - Better. They're going better. Sonny takes a moment to recover.
M	SONNY	You see? Profound satisfaction. Such is the inevitable result of a prolonged stay at the Marigold Hotel. And now Mr Maruthi has spotted something else. The
M	MR MARUTHI	What are those men doing?
M	SONNY	Working for me, Mr Maruthi. To create a home for the elderly so wonderful that they will simply refuse to die! Stare death in the face and say-
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	What are those men doing?
M	SONNY	Mummyji, what is going on here?
M	MRS KAPOOR	I have spoken to your brothers. They want to sell the hotel. These men are here to value the building.
M	SONNY	They are valuing the land. My brothers do not care about the building. They will knock it down.
M	MRS KAPOOR	They could just wait a month for it to fall down of its own accord.
M	SONNY	You joke, Mummyji, but inside I know you are not laughing. You do not want to see this dream destroyed. Send these people away.
M	MRS KAPOOR	No, my son. It is too late.
M	SONNY	Mummyji, please -
M	MRS KAPOOR	These figures do not support your argument.
M	SONNY	There is still time to turn things around. With a small injection of funds, we can -
M	MRS KAPOOR	Who is trusting you with that money? Eh? You, who cannot run a chai stand. Just like your father. Beat. Then Sonny speaks quietly.
M	SONNY	Do I remind you of him so much? Is that why you must be cruel to me?
M	MRS KAPOOR	You think I am cruel?
M	SONNY	You loved my father. And he loved this hotel. Two mistakes. There will not be a third. Say goodbye to all this, Sonny. And come with me to Delhi. Your life will become easier.
M	SONNY	Not easier, Mummyji. Smaller. He leaves. Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair.
M	MRS KAPOOR	Mrs Donnelly. Can I help you?
F	MURIEL	Depends. Do you know how to use a computer?
M	MRS KAPOOR	I assume you are joking.
F	MURIEL	Mrs Ainslie said she had an address where I could get some things I need. Some biscuits. She said I could get them on the line.
M	MRS KAPOOR	I wish you luck. Mrs Kapoor smiles, and leaves. Muriel watches her go, then turns to the computer.
F	JEAN	The whole thing is actually tremendously exciting. Not just getting on a plane, but getting on a plane and turning left.
M	NORMAN	Turning left?
F	JEAN	First class. And home in time for our 40th wedding anniversary. We haven't yet decided how to mark the occasion.
F	MADGE	Perhaps a minute's silence?
M	NORMAN	Two should fit us all, I think.
F	EVELYN	I'm actually going to walk. Apparently they're getting ready for a festival.
M	DOUGLAS	Perhaps you'd like one of us to accompany you.
F	MADGE	I'm happy to walk with you.
F	EVELYN	I'll be fine. Evelyn speaks to both Douglas and Jean.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	I'm delighted for your daughter's success. I wish you all every happiness.
F	JEAN	Thank you. Evelyn turns, and walks away. A motor-bike hurtles past them, going the other way.
M	DOUGLAS	Was that Sonny? He answers.
M	YES	Ma?
F	EVELYN	I just wanted to hear your voice. No, I'm sorry, I didn't think about the time . How are you? And Polly? The boys . how are the boys? She listens to him. She's holding back tears.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	Oh good, I'm glad you've been reading it. Yes. Yes, I've made some very good friends. No, I'm fine, of course I am. As much as she had wanted to speak to him, she now wants
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	I think my money is running out, I'd better go. Goodbye for now, darling. I'll call again later. She hangs up. And stays there with her hand on the phone.
M	SONNY	Mrs Greenslade. Where are the others?
F	EVELYN	They're on their way to the hotel. Sonny looks around, at a loss.
M	EVELYN (CONT'D)	What's the matter?
M	SONNY	I wanted to warn you before you see for yourself of the most momentous changes that are occurring, absolutely all of them without question for the very positive.
F	EVELYN	What are you talking about?
M	SONNY	I am delighted to announce the closing of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and the joyful return of all of its inhabitants to their home country.
F	EVELYN	What?
M	MRS KAPOOR	Please relax in the knowledge that your journey home is being arranged, and paid for by the hotel.
F	MADGE	Our journey here was arranged and paid for by the hotel, and look how that went. I'd rather walk back to England.
M	NORMAN	I'd rather not go back at all. A voice comes behind them. Carol has come out of the
F	CAROL	Why would you have to?
M	SONNY	And for myself the news is even better. I shall be moving to Delhi to live with my mother, and furthermore I shall be wed to a most suitable person of her choice, whom I look forward very much to meeting before I spend the rest of my life with her.
F	EVELYN	But what about your girlfriend?
M	SONNY	She is no longer my girlfriend.
F	EVELYN	This is a disaster.
M	SONNY	Then we must treat it just the same as we would treat a triumph, is that not what your Mr Kipling tells us? Although of course, here we have a problem. Because I, Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have never had a triumph, so of course I do not know how to treat one. No, all I have had is an constant series of disasters interspersed with the occasional catastrophe, an unending stream of total -
F	EVELYN	Sonny, do you love her? Sunaina?
M	SONNY	Most deeply.
F	EVELYN	Have you told her you love her?
M	SONNY	It is because I love her that I must not tell her. She can do so much better than me.
F	EVELYN	And you have told her that?
M	SONNY	Many times.
F	EVELYN	Good. Women love it when you say that kind of thing. It's a powerful aphrodisiac.
M	SONNY	Really?
F	EVELYN	No, of course not. Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever. Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours. You can have anything you want, Sonny. You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it. Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love -
M	SONNY	Mrs Greenslade, stop drilling! You have struck oil! He goes to his bike, climbs on, and rockets off.
F	MADGE	Where's Norman?
F	CAROL	Packing.
F	MADGE	But we don't have to leave yet.
F	CAROL	I asked him to come and stay with me.
F	MADGE	Is that wise? I'm not sure he's trained.
F	CAROL	You think it's too soon.
F	MADGE	It doesn't matter what I think.
F	CAROL	It is too soon. But at our age we can't afford the luxury of taking it slow. And it's either this or he goes home and I don't want him to go home. Madge looks at her for a while. Then smiles.
F	MADGE	I wish you both the very best.
F	CAROL	You haven't met anyone?
F	MADGE	Single by choice. Just not my choice. I actually think it might be over. For me. With men. And if that's gone, I'm not quite sure what's left.
F	CAROL	Did you know Norman brought pills? The first night he stayed with me?
F	MADGE	They obviously did the trick.
F	CAROL	I saw them in his pocket. I didn't want it to be like that. So when I had the chance I swapped them.
M	CAROL (CONT'D)	He went all night on two aspirin. It's never over. Norman appears with his one bag and his battery radio.
M	NORMAN	Ready?
M	Evelyn approaches.	She sees a taxi waiting outside the hotel.
F	MURIEL	Do you want him to see you? A beat.
M	DOUGLAS	My wallet, I forgot my wallet. One second. Before Jean has a chance to say anything, he goes back in. She watches him go. Then Muriel speaks from her verandah.
F	MURIEL	She's not back yet. Douglas stops. Beat.
M	DOUGLAS	Right. Then perhaps you could tell her I said goodbye. He turns and walks out.
M	DOUGLAS	False alarm. Had it the whole time. Let's go. A SECURITY GUARD goes to stop him, but Sonny's already Sunaina! Sunaina! He reaches the seventh floor. Jay appears on the landing above him.
M	JAY	What's going on? Sonny is doubled over, totally out of breath. Holds up a
M	JAY (CONT'D)	Sonny?
M	SONNY	I need to see Sunaina!
M	JAY	Her shift's not over. And when it is, she doesn't want to see you. Beat.
M	SONNY	Jay, you are the son my mother wished I was; an intelligent man, with a strong head for business. You see things as they are, not as you wish them to be. So fuck off out of my way. Jaydoesn't move. Or you can give her a message. Sunaina is standing against the wall, unseen by Sonny,
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	Tell her from me what I should have told her the day we met. What I will announce to anyone who asks. And many who do not. Sunaina speaks to Jay.
F	SUNAINA	Including your mother? Including my mother?
F	SUNAINA	His mother. Your mother.
M	SONNY	I will tell every mother in the land. What will you tell them? What will you tell them?
M	SONNY	The only thing that matters in this world. That I love you. And always will. And by you, I mean Sunaina, Jay, not you. Although if you are to be my brother-in-law, I hope we can become better friends.
F	SUNAINA	Why is he only saying this now? You ask him.
F	SUNAINA	Why are you only saying this now?
M	SONNY	Because, Sunaina, love of my life, no more will I believe that I am not worthy, for only by loving you as you deserve will I become so. On Sunaina's face as she hears this. Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the He does a U-turn, speeds off back the way they came.
M	DOUGLAS	It's funny. They call it rush hour, but nothing actually moves. It's not that funny. Although I suppose it's all about context, isn't it? I mean -
F	JEAN	Douglas?
M	DOUGLAS	Yes?
F	JEAN	If you say one more word, I'll kill you with my thumbs.
F	MURIEL	Where d'you think you're going?
F	MADGE	You may well ask. Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree..
M	NORMAN	We're moving in together.
F	MURIEL	Already?
F	CAROL	That point has been made.
M	MRS KAPOOR	The hotel is closing.
F	MURIEL	Doesn't have to. Silence. Everyone stares at Muriel. She takes out the spreadsheets.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	I've been going over the accounts. Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead
F	JEAN	This is ridiculous. It could go on for hours. There's no way we're ever going to get out of here.
M	DOUGLAS	Maybe there is. A rickshaw arrives next to them, swerving through the
F	JEAN	You. Can you get us to the airport?
M	IFTI	Sorry long way sore legs not possible.
F	JEAN	I'll give you everything I have.
M	IFTI	Step right in mind your head let's go.
F	JEAN	Come on, Douglas. Come on! Douglas gets the suitcases out of the trunk of the cab.
M	IFTI	Sorry no manage people and cases.
F	JEAN	What?
M	IFTI	Not possible. Two person, no cases; one person, and cases.
F	JEAN	How about if I give you something else? My watch? Sure. Thank you. Still not possible.
M	DOUGLAS	We'll get another flight. We can go back to the hotel, and leave in the morning.
F	JEAN	No.
M	DOUGLAS	Jean, you heard what he said. He can't do it.
F	JEAN	He can do one person, and cases.
M	DOUGLAS	Yes, but
F	JEAN	Could fate find a better way to tell us what we need to hear?
M	DOUGLAS	Which is what?
F	JEAN	That it's over. It was over a long long time ago.
M	DOUGLAS	This is not the time to talk about this. Let's wait till we
F	JEAN	I have to go, Douglas.
M	DOUGLAS	I won't let you.
F	JEAN	No, you'll want to come after me. Chase me to the airport and tell me everything will be fine. But please don't. Because the truth is we both deserve more than we've had. You're just too kind and too loyal to admit it.
M	113A.	Beat.
M	JEAN (CONT'D)	I will be alright. I'm turning left. She climbs onto the rickshaw. As the drumming intensifies, Douglas stands holding his
M	MRS KAPOOR	I don't know what any of these figures mean. Sonny and Sunaina drive into the courtyard, screech to a They dismount.
M	SONNY	Mummyji? Mummyjit Right here, you do not need to shout.
M	SONNY	Do you remember what my father used to say? That nothing happens unless first we dream. Like him I have dreamt, Mummyji, and like him, I have failed. The Marigold Hotel is crumbling into dust. And it turns out I can live with that. But the one thing I will not do is live without this girl. To whom I did not introduce you properly before. This is Sunaina Shantanu Palawat. The woman I love, and wish to marry.
F	SUNAINA	I am very pleased to meet you, Mrs Kapoor. Sunaina puts out her hand. Mrs Kapoor will not take it.
M	MRS KAPOOR	No. I forbid it. I forbid this match. Utterly and completely. Do you hear me, Sonny? This cannot happen. And then a low, rumbling sound comes from the corner. Like Young Wasim is speaking. It's a long, poetic and heartfelt Unfortunately it's in Hindi.
F	MADGE	What is he saying?
F	MURIEL	What he said to me, I imagine. She turns to Sunaina.
M	MURIEL (CON'TD)	Can you help?
F	SUNAINA	He is saying . he is saying that he has been with this family as long as he can remember. Given them a lifetime of service. And that he remembers another fight, between two young people and their parents. And he remembers the moment where the young man stood up to his mother
M	MRS KAPOOR	. and said yes, I want to marry this woman. Yes, she is from a different community. But she is smart, she is beautiful, and I love her. Long pause. I don't know who he's talking about. She offers Sunaina her hand. Take care of my favourite son. Sunaina shakes her hand.
M	NORMAN	So I'm not clear now. Am I staying or going?
F	MURIEL	Depends how you read the accounts.
M	SONNY	The accounts?
F	MURIEL	Turns out the original plan is good, it works. Just not in the hands of an imbecile.
M	SONNY	I knew that plan was good!
F	MURIEL	What the place needs is more money.
M	SONNY	Unfortunately my investor, Mr Maruthi has decided that while he greatly admires my endeavors, he
F	MURIEL	He's reconsidered.
M	SONNY	You spoke to him?
F	MURIEL	So long as there is someone to help the manager.
M	SONNY	The manager needs no help.
F	SUNAINA	Sonny...
M	SONNY	The manager needs a little help. So will you stay? Norman looks at Carol.
M	NORMAN	I'd like to.
F	CAROL	In the shack on the roof?
M	NORMAN	I sleep in the trees. We have a double room. Bathroom ensuite. And a fully working door. He points to Graham's room.
M	SONNY (CONT'D)	A guest has recently checked out. Madge can't believe he just said that.
F	CAROL	I'll think about it. Mrs Hardcastle ? You're staying.
F	MADGE	On my own?
F	MURIEL	You're off your game. Lost your confidence, maybe. But you're a thoroughbred. You'll be back. Madge smiles.
M	MURIEL (CON'TD)	And what about you, Mrs Greenslade? Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel.
F	EVELYN	What about me, Mrs Donnelly?
F	MURIEL	We haven't talked much, you and
F	EVELYN	My loss, evidently. I'm not sure what I should do. Nothing here has quite worked out as I hoped. 117A.
F	MURIEL	Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff. Haven't you got work in the morning? Evelyn nods.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D)	Besides, he'll be back.
F	EVELYN	You don't know him. He's the most loyal man I've ever met.
F	MURIEL	50,000 rupees says I'm right. At your current salary that should take you three months to pay off. Muriel stands up. Everybody stares. She starts to walk
F	MURIEL	If you'll excuse me, someone's waiting to help me make mango chutney. Why did no one tell me about that stuff?
M	MRS KAPOOR	Who is the new assistant manager?
F	MURIEL	Why? Are you thinking of applying for the job? She gestures for her wheelchair. Sonny rushes up with it. She sinks down.
M	MURIEL (CONT'D))	That's enough exercise for one day.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Day 51. The only real failure is the failure to try. And the measure of success is how we cope with disappointment. As we always must. The sound fades as he disappears into the celebration, and
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	We came here, and we tried. All of us, in our different ways. Her alarm clock buzzes. She turns it off.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Some achieved more than others. but we did our best. Nothing else matters. Evelyn walks through the courtyard, and on out of the
F	EVELYN	Good morning.
M	DOUGLAS	It is, isn't it?
F	EVELYN	You're still here.
M	DOUGLAS	I missed the plane.
F	EVELYN	What about Jean?
M	DOUGLAS	She didn't. Beat.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	I had quite an interesting night, actually. I met the same taxi driver, but this time I let him take me to his brother's hotel. Which turned out to be less of a hotel, and more of a brothel, really. They gave me this pipe, said it was apple tobacco, but that's not what we called it when I was a student. So I made my excuses and left, wanted some time to think. This city at night is extraordinary. Of course the apple tobacco helped. Guess what? I finally saw an elephant. Silence for a bit.
F	EVELYN	I'm late for work. She goes past him.
M	DOUGLAS	Um ... She stops, turns.
M	DOUGLAS (CONT'D)	What time do you finish?
F	EVELYN	I get back about 5.
M	DOUGLAS	Tea time.
F	EVELYN	Yes.
M	DOUGLAS	How do you take it?
F	EVELYN	With a little milk. She turns and walks away. She's smiling. Perhaps it's true: we don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing. Douglas is haggling with a motorbike mechanic. He seems to
M	EVELYN (V.0.) (CONT'D)	All we really know about the future is that it will be different.
M	EVELYN (V.0.) (CONT'D)	So we must celebrate the changes.
M	EVELYN (V.0.)	Let them come. Bring them on. Because as someone once said, everything will be alright in the end ... Coming from the other direction, another motorbike, Douglas So if it's really not alright, then trust me: it's not yet the end.
