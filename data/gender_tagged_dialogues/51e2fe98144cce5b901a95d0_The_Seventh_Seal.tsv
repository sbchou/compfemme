M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	KNIGHT	Who are you?
M	DEATH	I am Death.
M	KNIGHT	Have you come for me?
M	DEATH	I have been walking by your side for a long time.
M	KNIGHT	That I know.
M	DEATH	Are you prepared?
M	KNIGHT	My body is frightened, but I am not.
M	DEATH	Well, there is no shame in that.
M	KNIGHT	Wait a moment.
M	DEATH	That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves.
M	KNIGHT	You play chess, don't you?
M	DEATH	How did you know that?
M	KNIGHT	I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.
M	DEATH	Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player.
M	KNIGHT	But you can't be better than I am.
M	DEATH	Why do you want to play chess with me?
M	KNIGHT	I have my reasons.
M	DEATH	That is your privilege.
M	KNIGHT	The condition is that I may live as long as I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?
M	KNIGHT	You drew black!
M	DEATH	Very appropriate. Don't you think so?
M	JONS	Between a strumpet's legs to lie Is the life for which I sigh.
M	JONS	Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But your brother the Devil You will meet on every level.
M	JONS	In Färjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things. Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.
M	KNIGHT	Well, did he show you the way?
M	JONS	Not exactly.
M	KNIGHT	What did he say?
M	JONS	Nothing.
M	KNIGHT	Was he a mute?
M	JONS	No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.
M	KNIGHT	Oh?
M	JONS	He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing. One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.
M	KNIGHT	Must you sing?
M	JONS	No.
F	JOF	Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? We're a little hard up. People aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country.
F	JOF	Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen something. I've got to tell you about it!
F	MIA	What is it? What's happened?
F	JOF	Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a vision. It was real, absolutely real.
F	MIA	Oh, so you've had a vision again!
F	JOF	But I did see her!
F	MIA	Whom did you see?
F	JOF	The Virgin Mary.
F	MIA	Did you really see her?
F	JOF	She was so close to me that I could have touched her. She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. And everything became so still in the sky and on the earth. Can you understand ...
F	MIA	What an imagination you have.
F	JOF	You don't believe me! But it was real, I tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind.
F	MIA	Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush.
F	JOF	Why must you keep bringing that up?
F	MIA	And then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails.
F	JOF	Well, perhaps that time I made it up. I did it just so that you would believe in my other visions. The real ones. The ones that I didn't make up.
F	MIA	You have to keep your visions under control. Otherwise people will think that you're a half-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm not so sure about that.
F	JOF	I didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company.
M	SKAT	Haven't I told you once and for all that I need my morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm telling you to shut up!
F	MIA	If we would only get some rain. Everything is burned to cinders. We won't have anything to eat this winter.
F	JOF	We'll get by.
F	MIA	I want Mikael to have a better life than ours.
F	JOF	Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.
F	MIA	What's that?
F	JOF	To make one of the balls stand absolutely still in the air.
F	MIA	But that's impossible.
F	JOF	Impossible for us -- but not for him.
F	MIA	You're dreaming again.
F	JOF	I've composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to hear it?
F	MIA	Sing it. I'm very curious.
F	JOF	I have to sit up first.
F	JOF	On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high.
F	JOF	Mia! Are you asleep?
F	MIA	It's a lovely song.
F	JOF	I haven't finished yet.
F	MIA	I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards.
F	JOF	All you do is sleep.
M	SKAT	Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no thank you.
F	JOF	Are you going to play Death?
M	SKAT	Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense.
F	JOF	
M	SKAT	At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.
F	JOF	Wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? People like it better, and, besides, it's more fun.
M	SKAT	Idiot. There's a rumor going around that there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies.
F	JOF	And what part am I to play?
M	SKAT	You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be the Soul of Man.
F	JOF	That's a bad part, of course.
M	SKAT	Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the director of this company anyhow?
M	SKAT	Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by a thread. Your time is short. Are the women going to like me in this getup? Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead already.
F	MIA	Jof!
F	JOF	What is it?
F	MIA	Sit still. Don't move.
F	JOF	What do you mean?
F	MIA	Don't say anything.
F	JOF	I'm as silent as a grave.
F	MIA	Shh! I love you.
M	JONS	What is this supposed to represent?
M	PAINTER	The Dance of Death.
M	JONS	And that one is Death?
M	PAINTER	Yes, he dances off with all of them.
M	JONS	Why do you paint such nonsense?
M	PAINTER	I thought it would serve to remind people that they must die.
M	JONS	Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier.
M	PAINTER	Why should one always make people happy? It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while.
M	JONS	Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting.
M	PAINTER	Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman.
M	JONS	If you do scare them ...
M	PAINTER	They'll think.
M	JONS	And if they think ...
M	PAINTER	They'll become still more scared.
M	JONS	And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests.
M	PAINTER	That's not my business.
M	JONS	You're only painting your Dance of Death.
M	PAINTER	I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone else can do as he likes.
M	JONS	Just think how some people will curse you.
M	PAINTER	Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me.
M	JONS	The plague. That sounds horrible.
M	PAINTER	You should see the boils on a diseased man's throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man I've painted over there.
M	JONS	That looks terrible.
M	PAINTER	It certainly does. He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you?
M	JONS	Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the horrors you've painted over there?
M	PAINTER	The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of God.
M	JONS	Do they really whip themselves?
M	PAINTER	Yes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by.
M	JONS	Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.
M	PAINTER	I think I frightened you after all.
M	KNIGHT	I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty.
M	KNIGHT	The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust.
M	KNIGHT	Through my indifference to my fellow men, I have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.
M	DEATH	And yet you don't want to die.
M	KNIGHT	Yes, I do.
M	DEATH	What are you waiting for?
M	KNIGHT	I want knowledge.
M	DEATH	You want guarantees?
M	KNIGHT	Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?
M	KNIGHT	How can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to? And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?
M	KNIGHT	Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that I can't shake off? Do you hear me?
M	DEATH	Yes, I hear you.
M	KNIGHT	I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me.
M	DEATH	But He remains silent.
M	KNIGHT	I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there.
M	DEATH	Perhaps no one is there.
M	KNIGHT	Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.
M	DEATH	Most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life.
M	KNIGHT	But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness.
M	DEATH	
M	KNIGHT	In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God.
M	DEATH	You are worrying ...
M	KNIGHT	Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter.
M	DEATH	What matter is that?
M	KNIGHT	My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.
M	DEATH	Is that why you are playing chess with Death?
M	KNIGHT	He is a clever opponent, but up to now I haven't lost a single man.
M	DEATH	How will you outwit Death in your game?
M	KNIGHT	I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.
M	DEATH	I'll remember that.
M	KNIGHT	You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet again, and I'll find a way.
M	DEATH	We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue playing.
M	KNIGHT	This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it. The sun is still high in the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.
M	JONS	Me and my master have been abroad and have just come home. Do you understand, you little pictor?
M	PAINTER	The Crusade.
M	JONS	Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. But what you said about the plague was horrible.
M	PAINTER	It's worse than that.
M	JONS	Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you. That's the truth.
M	PAINTER	The rump behind you, the rump behind you there's a profound truth.
M	JONS	This is squire Jöns. He grins at Death, mocks the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. His world is a Jönsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell.
M	JONS	That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What is it good for?
M	SOLDIER	She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil One.
M	JONS	And now she's in the stocks.
M	SOLDIER	She will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of us.
M	JONS	And you do that with this stinking mess?
M	SOLDIER	It's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the smell.
M	JONS	Neither can I.
M	KNIGHT	Have you seen the Devil?
M	MONK	You must not talk to her.
M	KNIGHT	Can that be so dangerous?
M	MONK	I don't know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected.
M	KNIGHT	I understand.
M	RAVEL	Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the dead. These days it's quite a lucrative enterprise.
M	RAVEL	You're thinking of running to the village and telling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each of us has to save his own skin. It's as simple as that.
M	GIRL	Don't touch me.
M	RAVAL	Don't try to scream. There's no one around to hear you, neither God nor man.
M	JONS	I recognize you, although it's a long time since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.
M	JONS	Am I not right?
M	JONS	You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better-class crusade to the Holy Land.
M	JONS	You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-ache?
M	JONS	When I see you, I suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. The Lord wanted to punish us for our complacency. That is why He sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight.
M	RAVEL	I acted in good faith.
M	JONS	But now you know better, don't you? Because now you have turned into a thief. A more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. Isn't that so?
M	JONS	By all means. I'm not bloodthirsty.
M	RAVEL	Don't beat me.
M	JONS	I don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. But remember this: the next time we meet, I'll brand your face the way one does with thieves. What I really came for is to get my waterskin filled.
M	GIRL	We have a deep well with cool, fresh water. Come, I'll show you.
M	JONS	Jöns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With them, there is no limit to my kindness.
M	JONS	Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped you, but between you and me, I'm tired of that kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.
M	JONS	Now that I think of it, I will need a housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? As far as I know, I'm still a married man, but I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now. That's why I need a housekeeper. The devil with it! Come along and don't stand there staring. I've saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.
M	SKAT	Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your interest. Please remain standing for a little longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that's me.
M	SKAT	Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If you'll shut up over there, you'll see something splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I haven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to hide behind the curtain for the time being. It's damned hot. I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
F	JOF	Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my wife so frail ...
M	VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC	Does she snore?
F	JOF	May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn't snore.
M	VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC	I think she should snore anyhow.
F	JOF	Night and moonlight now prevail. There snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. Jealous I am, as never before, I hide myself behind this door. Faithful is she to her lover -- not me. He soon comes a- stealing To awaken her lusty feeling. I shall now kill him dead For cuckolding me in my bed. There he comes in the moonlight, His white legs shining bright. Quiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, Tell him not that he's about to die.
F	MIA	Look, there he comes in the night My lover, my heart's delight.
M	MONK	God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall all perish in the black death. You, standing there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may be your last hour? Death stands right behind you. I can see how his crown gleams in the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads. Which one of you shall he strike first? You there, who stand staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, woman, who bloom with life and self-satisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns? You back there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse? Do you know, you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do you hear the word? You have been sentenced, sentenced!
M	MONK	Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of your son, Jesus Christ.
M	JONS	This damned ranting about doom. Is that food for the minds of modern people? Do they really expect us to take them seriously?
M	JONS	Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me to point out that I've either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other.
M	KNIGHT	Yes, yes.
M	JONS	Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost -- all these I've accepted without too much emotion.
M	JONS	My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying.
M	JONS	What are you screaming about?
M	PLOG	I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire Jöns.
M	JONS	That's possible.
M	PLOG	Have you seen my wife?
M	JONS	No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd seen her.
M	PLOG	Well, in that case you haven't seen her.
M	JONS	Maybe she's run off.
M	PLOG	Do you know anything?
M	JONS	I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you.
M	MERCHANT	Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along the west coast. People are dying like flies. Usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole stock unsold.
M	WOMAN	They speak of the judgment day. And all these omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf's head.
M	OLD MAN	The day of judgment. Imagine.
M	FARMER	It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely lose our crops.
M	MERCHANT	And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go.
M	OLD MAN	The day of judgment. Just think, just think!
M	FARMER	If it's as they say, I suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can.
M	WOMAN	But there have been other things too, such things that can't even be spoken of. Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that's why she must cleanse herself.
M	OLD MAN	Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. I imagine they'll come on judgment night, at sundown.
M	WOMAN	There are many who have purged themselves with fire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell.
M	MERCHANT	This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out loud, but all of us know that it's the end. And people are going mad from fear.
M	FARMER	So you're afraid too.
M	MERCHANT	Of course I'm afraid.
M	OLD MAN	The judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.
M	RAVAL	Do you want this armlet? You can have it cheap.
F	JOF	I can't afford it.
M	RAVAL	It's real silver.
F	JOF	It's nice. But it's surely too expensive for me.
M	PLOG	Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife?
F	JOF	Has she disappeared?
M	PLOG	They say she's run away.
F	JOF	Has she deserted you?
M	PLOG	With an actor.
F	JOF	An actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I think you should let her go.
M	PLOG	You're right. My first thought, of course, was to kill her.
F	JOF	Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do.
M	PLOG	I'm also going to kill the actor.
F	JOF	The actor?
M	PLOG	Of course, the one she eloped with.
F	JOF	What has he done to deserve that?
M	PLOG	Are you stupid?
F	JOF	The actor! Now I understand. There are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor.
M	PLOG	You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre.
F	JOF	And that turned out to be her misfortune.
M	PLOG	Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. Isn't that true?
M	RAVAL	Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the smith.
F	JOF	I! A liar!
M	RAVAL	You're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with Plog's old lady.
M	PLOG	Are you an actor too?
F	JOF	An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that!
M	RAVAL	We ought to kill you; it's only logical.
F	JOF	You're really funny.
M	RAVAL	How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you anything on your conscience?
F	JOF	You're funny. Don't you think he's funny? Oh, you don't.
M	RAVAL	Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind.
M	PLOG	What have you done with my wife?
F	JOF	Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked someone, or got in the way? I'll leave right now and never come back.
M	RAVAL	Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder.
M	RAVAL	Stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are.
M	PLOG	What have you done with my wife?
M	RAVAL	Don't lie there moaning. Get up and dance.
F	JOF	I don't want to. I can't.
M	RAVEL	Show us how you imitate a bear.
F	JOF	I can't play a bear.
M	RAVAL	Let's see if you can't after all.
M	RAVEL	Up again! Be a good bear.
F	JOF	I haven't done any harm. I haven't got the strength to play a bear any more.
M	JONS	Do you remember what I was going to do to you if we met again?
M	JONS	I'm a man who keeps his word.
M	KNIGHT	What's his name?
F	MIA	Mikael.
M	KNIGHT	How old is he?
F	MIA	Oh, he'll soon be two.
M	KNIGHT	He's big for his age.
F	MIA	Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big.
M	KNIGHT	You played some kind of show this afternoon.
F	MIA	Did you think it was bad?
M	KNIGHT	You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming.
F	MIA	You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now.
M	KNIGHT	Is that your husband?
F	MIA	Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is Jof.
M	KNIGHT	Oh, that one.
F	MIA	And now there's only him and me. We'll have to start doing tricks again and that's more trouble than it's worth.
M	KNIGHT	Do you do tricks also?
F	MIA	We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful juggler.
M	KNIGHT	Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?
F	MIA	Jof wants him to be.
M	KNIGHT	But you don't.
F	MIA	I don't know. Perhaps he'll become a knight.
M	KNIGHT	Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either.
F	MIA	No, you don't look so happy.
M	KNIGHT	No.
F	MIA	Are you tired?
M	KNIGHT	Yes.
F	MIA	Why?
M	KNIGHT	I have dull company.
F	MIA	Do you mean your squire?
M	KNIGHT	No, not him.
F	MIA	Who do you mean, then?
M	KNIGHT	Myself.
F	MIA	I understand.
M	KNIGHT	Do you, really?
F	MIA	Yes, I understand rather well. I have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. Isn't that so?
F	JOF	Ouch, it hurts.
F	MIA	Why did you have to go there? And of course you drank.
F	JOF	Ouch! I didn't drink anything.
F	MIA	Then I suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with. People don't like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies.
F	JOF	I swear to you that I didn't say a word about angels.
F	MIA	You were, of course, busy singing and dancing. You can never stop being an actor. People also become angry at that, and you know it.
F	JOF	Look what I bought for you.
F	MIA	You couldn't afford it.
F	JOF	But I got it anyhow.
F	JOF	Oh, how they beat me.
F	MIA	Why didn't you beat them back?
F	JOF	I only become frightened and angry. I never get a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know that. I roared like a lion.
F	MIA	Were they frightened?
F	JOF	No, they just laughed.
F	MIA	Do you notice how good he smells?
F	JOF	And he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy one. A real acrobat's body.
F	MIA	Yes, this is my husband, Jof.
F	JOF	Good evening.
M	KNIGHT	Good evening.
M	KNIGHT	I have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you.
F	JOF	Yes, he's fine.
F	JOF	Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia?
M	KNIGHT	Thank you, I don't want anything.
F	MIA	I picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow...
F	JOF	...that we were allowed to milk. So, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor.
F	MIA	Please be seated and I'll bring the food.
M	KNIGHT	Where are you going next?
F	JOF	Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore.
M	KNIGHT	I wouldn't advise you to go there.
F	JOF	Why not, if I may ask?
M	KNIGHT	The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.
F	JOF	Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard.
M	KNIGHT	May I suggest... ...that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east coast. You'll probably be safer there.
F	JOF	I wish you good appetite.
M	KNIGHT	I humbly thank you.
F	MIA	These are wild strawberries from the forest. I have never seen such large ones. They grow up there on the hillside. Notice how they smell!
F	JOF	Your suggestion is good, but I must think it over.
F	MIA	It might be wise to have company going through the forest. It's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.
F	JOF	Yes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I have become director of the whole company.
F	MIA	After all, I have become director of the whole company.
F	MIA	Do you want some strawberries?
F	JOF	This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, and let us be together.
F	MIA	Oh, how nice this is.
M	KNIGHT	For a short while.
F	MIA	Nearly always. One day is like another. There is nothing strange about that. The summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don't have to be cold. But spring is best of all.
F	JOF	I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps you'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre.
F	MIA	Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by your songs.
M	JONS	By all means. I write little songs myself. For example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet.
M	JONS	You'll not get to hear it either. There are persons here who don't appreciate my art and I don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive soul.
M	KNIGHT	People are troubled by so much.
F	MIA	It's always better when one is two. Have you no one of your own?
M	KNIGHT	Yes, I think I had someone. And what is she doing now?
M	KNIGHT	I don't know.
F	MIA	You look so solemn. Was she your beloved?
M	KNIGHT	We were newly married and we played together. We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears. We went hunting together and at night we danced. The house was full of life...
F	MIA	Do you want some more strawberries?
M	KNIGHT	Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.
F	MIA	I don't understand what you mean.
M	KNIGHT	Everything I've said seems meaningless and unreal while I sit here with you and your husband. How unimportant it all becomes suddenly.
F	MIA	Now you don't look so solemn.
M	KNIGHT	I shall remember this moment. The silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk, your faces in the evening light. Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to remember what we have talked about. I'll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.
M	KNIGHT	And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me.
M	DEATH	I have been waiting for you.
M	KNIGHT	Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments. Because I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in retreat. It's your move.
M	DEATH	Why do you look so satisfied?
M	KNIGHT	That's my secret.
M	DEATH	Of course. Now I take your knight.
M	KNIGHT	You did the right thing.
M	DEATH	Have you tricked me?
M	KNIGHT	Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check!
M	DEATH	What are you laughing at?
M	KNIGHT	Don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead.
M	DEATH	You're rather arrogant.
M	KNIGHT	Our game amuses me.
M	DEATH	It's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed for time.
M	KNIGHT	I understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game. It takes time.
M	DEATH	Are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest? Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have a small son?
M	KNIGHT	Why do you ask?
M	DEATH	Oh, no reason at all.
M	JONS	God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith?
M	PLOG	Good evening.
M	JONS	Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?
M	PLOG	Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a rabbit.
M	JONS	If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way.
M	PLOG	Are you married?
M	JONS	I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count of all my wives any longer. But it's often that way when you're a traveling man.
M	PLOG	I can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred, or else I've had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world, which isn't impossible.
M	JONS	Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them. So, however you look at it, it's still best to kill them off while it's most amusing.
M	PLOG	Women's nagging, the shrieking of children and wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a mother-in- law. And then, when one wants to sleep after a long day, there's a new song -- tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead.
M	JONS	Why don't you kiss me good night?
M	PLOG	Why don't you sing a song for me?
M	JONS	Why don't you love me the way you did when we first met?
M	PLOG	Why don't you look at my new slip?
M	JONS	You only turn your back and snore.
M	PLOG	Oh hell!
M	JONS	Oh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!
M	PLOG	I'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in their chests with a small hammer, I'll tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.
M	JONS	Look how he howls again.
M	PLOG	Maybe I love her.
M	JONS	So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor misguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around.
M	PLOG	Yes, but it hurts anyway.
M	JONS	Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love. But you almost always get over it.
M	PLOG	No, no, not me.
M	JONS	Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while. Love is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any. If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.
M	PLOG	You're happy, you with your oily words, and, besides, you believe your own drivel.
M	JONS	Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one, because after all I really am an educated man.
M	PLOG	Listen, Jöns. May I go with you through the forest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home because everyone will laugh at me.
M	JONS	Only if you don't whimper all the time, because in that case we'll all have to avoid you.
F	JOF	Jöns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all the time. He's not quite sane.
M	JONS	Yes, but now he's just sniveling.
M	PLOG	I'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have such a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.
M	PLOG	Come in my arms, little brother.
F	JOF	Thank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now we're really in a hurry.
M	PLOG	Now the moon has come out of the clouds.
M	JONS	That's good. Now we can see the road better.
F	MIA	I don't like the moon tonight.
F	JOF	The trees stand so still.
M	JONS	That's because there's no wind.
M	PLOG	I guess he means that they stand very still.
F	JOF	It's completely quiet.
M	JONS	If one could hear a fox at least.
F	JOF	Or an owl.
M	JONS	Or a human voice besides one's own.
M	GIRL	They say it's dangerous to remain standing in moonlight.
M	JONS	Where are you going?
M	SOLDIER	To the place of execution.
M	JONS	Yes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done it with the Black One. The witch?
M	KNIGHT	I see that they have hurt your hands.
M	KNIGHT	I have a potion that will stop your pain.
M	JONS	Why do you burn her at this time of night? People have so few diversions these days.
M	SOLDIER	Saints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that she brings the Devil with her wherever she goes.
M	JONS	You are eight brave men, then.
M	SOLDIER	Well, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer job.
M	KNIGHT	What's your name?
M	TYAN	My name is Tyan, my lord.
M	KNIGHT	How old are you?
M	TYAN	Fourteen, my lord.
M	KNIGHT	And is it true that you have been in league with the Devil?
M	KNIGHT	They say that you have been in league with the Devil.
M	TYAN	Why do you ask?
M	KNIGHT	Not out of curiosity, but for very personal reasons. I too want to meet him.
M	TYAN	Why?
M	KNIGHT	I want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, must know.
M	TYAN	You can see him anytime.
M	KNIGHT	How?
M	TYAN	You must do as I tell you.
M	TYAN	Look into my eyes.
M	TYAN	What do you see? Do you see him?
M	KNIGHT	I see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. But nothing else.
M	TYAN	No one, nothing, no one?
M	KNIGHT	No.
M	TYAN	Can't you see him behind your back?
M	KNIGHT	No, there is no one there.
M	TYAN	But he is with me everywhere. I only have to stretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He is with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He will protect me from everything evil.
M	KNIGHT	Has he told you this?
M	TYAN	I know it.
M	KNIGHT	Has he said it?
M	TYAN	I know it, I know it. You must see him somewhere, you must. The priests had no difficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. They are so afraid of him that they don't even dare touch me.
M	KNIGHT	Why have you crushed her hands?
M	SOLDIER	We didn't do it.
M	KNIGHT	Who did?
M	SOLDIER	Ask the monk.
M	KNIGHT	What have you done with the child?
M	DEATH	Don't you ever stop asking questions?
M	KNIGHT	No, I'll never stop.
M	JONS	For a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, but it would do no good. She's nearly dead already.
M	SOLDIER	I've told you to be careful. Don't go too close to her.
M	KNIGHT	Take this and it will stop the pain.
M	JONS	What does she see? Can you tell me?
M	KNIGHT	She feels no more pain.
M	JONS	You don't answer my question. Who watches over that child? Is it the angels, or God, or the Devil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my lord!
M	KNIGHT	This cannot be.
M	JONS	Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has just made a discovery. Emptiness under the moon.
M	KNIGHT	No.
M	JONS	We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our sides, because we see what she sees, and our terror and hers are the same. That poor little child. I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
M	PLOG	Oh, now it came over me again!
M	JONS	Don't scream. What came over you?
M	PLOG	My wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is so beautiful that she can't be described without the accompaniment of a lyre.
M	JONS	Now it starts again.
M	PLOG	Her smile is like brandy. Her eyes like blackberries...
M	JONS	Get up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the others.
M	PLOG	Yes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a little pink potato; her behind is like a juicy pear -- yes, the whole woman is like a strawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, with arms like wonderful cucumbers.
M	JONS	Saints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, despite the fact that you're drunk. And your vegetable garden bores me.
M	PLOG	Look there.
M	JONS	Do you see something?
M	PLOG	There, over there!
M	JONS	I don't see anything.
M	PLOG	Hang on to something, my friends. The hour is near! Who is that at the edge of the forest if not my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?
M	SKAT	You miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven scurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I would be stricken with such eternal shame about my breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in short, about my whole body -- that I would immediately rid nature of my own embarrassing self.
M	PLOG	Watch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart on you and immediately blow you down to the actor's own red- hot hell, where you can sit and recite monologues to each other until the dust comes out of the Devil's ears.
F	LISA	Forgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do it again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine how terribly that man over there betrayed me.
M	PLOG	I'll kill him anyway.
F	LISA	Yes, do that, just kill him. He isn't even a human being.
M	JONS	Hell, he's an actor.
F	LISA	He is only a false beard, false teeth, false smiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a jug. Just kill him.
M	SKAT	She's right. Just kill me. If you thought that I was going to apologize for being what I am, you are mistaken.
F	LISA	Look how sickening he is. How he makes a fool of himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, kill him.
M	SKAT	My friends, you have only to push, and my unreality will soon be transformed into a new, solid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse.
F	LISA	Do something then. Kill him.
M	PLOG	He has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.
M	SKAT	Your life's thread now hangs by a very ragged shred. Idiot, your day is short.
M	PLOG	You'll have to irritate me a little more to get me as angry as before.
M	SKAT	I forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes.
M	PLOG	Oh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, there's no life left in him. I was beginning to like him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too spiteful.
F	JOF	He's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, I've never seen such a dead actor.
F	LISA	Come on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn over. He has only himself to blame.
M	PLOG	And I have to be married to her.
M	JONS	We must go on.
M	SKAT	Now that was a good scene. I'm really a good actor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little pleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll wait until it becomes light and then I'll find the easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb up a tree for the time being so that no bears, wolves or ghosts can get at me.
M	SKAT	Tomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll go to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make lots of money there. Now, I'll sing a little song to myself: I am a little bird Who sings whate'er he will, And when I am in danger I fling out a pissing trill As in the carnal thrill. It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. The terrible night doesn't frighten me...
M	SKAT	Workmen in the forest. Oh, well! The terrible night doesn't frighten me... Hey, what the devil... it's my tree they're cutting down.
M	SKAT	Hey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? What are you doing with my tree?
M	SKAT	Can't you at least answer me? Politeness costs so little. Who are you?
M	DEATH	I'm sawing down your tree because your time is up.
M	SKAT	It won't do. I haven't got time.
M	DEATH	So you haven't got time.
M	SKAT	No, I have my performance.
M	DEATH	Then it's canceled because of death.
M	SKAT	My contract.
M	DEATH	Your contract is terminated.
M	SKAT	My children, my family.
M	DEATH	Shame on you, Skat!
M	SKAT	Yes, I'm ashamed.
M	SKAT	Isn't there any way to get off? Aren't there any special rules for actors?
M	DEATH	No, not in this case.
M	SKAT	No loopholes, no exceptions?
M	SKAT	Perhaps you'll take a bribe.
M	SKAT	Help!
M	SKAT	Help! Help!
M	JONS	Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to hang over us like a smothering blanket.
F	LISA	I'm so frightened.
M	PLOG	We feel that something is going to happen to us, but we don't know what.
M	JONS	Maybe it's the day of judgment.
M	PLOG	The day of judgment...
M	RAVAL	Do you have some water?
M	RAVAL	Can't you give me a little water? I have the plague.
M	JONS	Don't come here. If you do I'll slit your throat. Keep to the other side of the tree.
M	RAVEL	I'm afraid of death.
M	RAVEL	I don't want to die! I don't want to!
M	RAVAL	Can't you have pity on me? Help me! At least talk to me.
M	RAVAL	I am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to me! Can no one console me? Haven't you any compassion? Can't you see that I...
M	RAVAL	Can't anyone... only a little water.
M	JONS	It's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no use. It's meaningless. It's totally meaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. Can't you hear that I'm consoling you?
M	RAVEL	Help me, help me!
M	DEATH	Shall we play our game to the end?
M	KNIGHT	Your move!
M	DEATH	Now I take your queen.
M	KNIGHT	I didn't notice that.
F	JOF	Mia!
F	MIA	Yes, what is it?
F	JOF	I see something terrible. Something I almost can't talk about.
F	MIA	What do you see?
F	JOF	The knight is sitting over there playing chess.
F	MIA	Yes, I can see that too and I don't think it's so terrible.
F	JOF	But do you see who he's playing with?
F	MIA	He is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way.
F	JOF	No, no, he isn't alone.
F	MIA	Who is it, then?
F	JOF	Death. He is sitting there playing chess with Death himself.
F	MIA	You mustn't say that.
F	JOF	We must try to escape.
F	MIA	One can't do that.
F	JOF	We must try. They are so occupied with their game that if we move very quietly, they won't notice us.
F	JOF	I have harnessed the horse. The wagon is standing near the big tree. You go first and I'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael doesn't wake up.
M	DEATH	It is your move, Antonius Block.
M	DEATH	Have you lost interest in our game?
M	KNIGHT	Lost interest? On the contrary.
M	DEATH	You seem anxious. Are you hiding anything?
M	KNIGHT	Nothing escapes you -- or does it?
M	DEATH	Nothing escapes me. No one escapes from me.
M	KNIGHT	It's true that I'm worried.
M	KNIGHT	I've forgotten how the pieces stood.
M	DEATH	But I have not forgotten. You can't get away that easily.
M	DEATH	Now I see something interesting.
M	KNIGHT	What do you see?
M	DEATH	You are mated on the next move, Antonius Block.
M	KNIGHT	That's true.
M	DEATH	Did you enjoy your reprieve?
M	KNIGHT	Yes, I did.
M	DEATH	I'm happy to hear that. Now I'll be leaving you. When we meet again, you and your companions' time will be up.
M	KNIGHT	And you will divulge your secrets.
M	DEATH	I have no secrets.
M	KNIGHT	So you know nothing.
M	DEATH	I have nothing to tell.
F	MIA	What a strange light.
F	JOF	I guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with dawn.
F	MIA	No, it's something else. Something terrible. Do you hear the roar in the forest?
F	JOF	It's probably rain.
F	MIA	No, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's following us. He has overtaken us; he's coming towards us.
F	JOF	Not yet, Mia. In any case, not yet.
F	MIA	I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.
F	JOF	Get into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. We'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.
F	JOF	It is the Angel of Death that's passing over us, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death, and he's very big.
F	MIA	Do you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm terribly cold.
F	KARIN	I heard from people who came from the crusade that you were on your way home. I've been waiting for you here. All the others have fled from the plague.
F	KARIN	Don't you recognize me any more?
F	KARIN	You also have changed.
F	KARIN	Now I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that boy who went away so many years ago.
M	KNIGHT	It's over now and I'm a little tired.
F	KARIN	I see that you're tired.
M	KNIGHT	Over there stand my friends.
F	KARIN	Ask them in. They will break the fast with us.
F	KARIN	"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour. And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. And another..."
F	KARIN	"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all the green grass was burnt up."
F	KARIN	"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and a third part of the sea became blood..."
M	KNIGHT	Was someone there?
M	JONS	No, my lord. I saw no one.
F	KARIN	"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called Wormwood..."
M	KNIGHT	Good morning, noble lord.
F	KARIN	I am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you courteously to my house.
M	PLOG	I am a smith by profession and rather good at my trade, if I say so myself. My wife Lisa -- curtsy for the great lord, Lisa. She's a little difficult to handle once in a while and we had a little spat, so to speak, but no worse than most people.
M	KNIGHT	From our darkness, we call out to Thee, Lord. Have mercy on us because we are small and frightened and ignorant.
M	JONS	In the darkness where You are supposed to be, where all of us probably are... In the darkness You will find no one to listen to Your cries or be touched by Your sufferings. Wash Your tears and mirror Yourself in Your indifference.
M	KNIGHT	God, You who are somewhere, who must be somewhere, have mercy upon us.
M	JONS	I could have given you an herb to purge you of your worries about eternity. Now it seems to be too late. But in any case, feel the immense triumph of this last minute when you can still roll your eyes and move your toes.
F	KARIN	Quiet, quiet.
M	JONS	I shall be silent, but under protest.
M	GIRL	It is the end.
F	JOF	I see them, Mia! I see them! Over there against the dark, stormy sky. They are all there. The smith and Lisa and the knight and Raval and Jöns and Skat. And Death, the severe master, invites them to dance. He tells them to hold each other's hands and then they must tread the dance in a long row. And first goes the master with his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles at the end with his lyre. They dance away from the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the dark lands, while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the tears from their cheeks.
F	MIA	You with your visions and dreams.
