M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. "I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit." And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
M	A BLOOD RED MOON	reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
M	TWO BLACK BOOTS	land hard in the water...and we're in: His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL. He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
M	FRESH. BLOODY.	He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE, Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
M	BURTON	Goddamn' animals. Nights like this I wish I could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn. A good ol' boy barbecue, huh? Burton doesn't even smile. He's dead fucking serious.
M	BURTON	A fresh start. That's what this place needs. He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
M	BURTON	Pow! Pow! Pow! Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh. Estevez eyes his
M	ESTEVEZ	Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da-- KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE Freeze! Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
M	ESTEVEZ	Drop the bags! Hands on your head! In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.
M	MICHAEL	It's starting. There isn't much time. The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
M	BURTON	Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now! Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.
M	ESTEVEZ	Hands on your head! On your head! Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.
M	BURTON	Turn around! Turn the fuck around! Michael slowly turns around. Calm. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.
M	BURTON	Let `em go!
M	ESTEVEZ	Take the shot, Burton!
M	BURTON	I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g-- Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
M	ESTEVEZ	Burton!? THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
M	BURTON	What are you doing, Michael? These weren't your orders. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.
M	ESTEVEZ	What did you say? Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.
M	MICHAEL	I'm following my own orders now.
M	BURTON	Then you will die along with the child.
M	ESTEVEZ	Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?! BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH! The squad car window And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags Bolts awake. Breathing hard. Covered with sweat. Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.
M	CHARLIE (O.S.)	You okay, Jeep? Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
M	JEEP	Sorry to wake you, Charlie.
F	CHARLIE	Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a storm all night. Must know somethin' I don't. She approaches Jeep. Sees the strain in his eyes.
F	CHARLIE	Another bad dream? He struggles for a moment, nods.
F	CHARLIE	It's just stress, Jeep, that's all. You do too much worryin'. About this place. About your dad. About me... A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.
M	JEEP	You're the only thing I like worrying about.
F	CHARLIE	See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares. Jeep turns away, dejected.
M	JEEP	Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else does.
F	CHARLIE	C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life. This is not news Jeep wants to hear.
M	JEEP	So you're still going through with it...?
F	CHARLIE	Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
M	JEEP	I could help you. We could do it together, you know? I want to. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but
F	CHARLIE	You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders. Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.
F	CHARLIE	Now can we go back in? I'm freezing my ass off out here.
M	JEEP	Go on. I'll be right there. Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of
M	JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)	I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
M	CLARENCE (ON TV)	Oh, I've got to earn them and you'll help me, won't you? Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
M	PERCY	Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back.
M	BOB	Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We got a special relationship here.
M	PERCY	Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship. The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
M	SANDRA (O.S.)	It's disgusting. You're right. It is disgusting. Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
F	SANDRA	Really, how can she go out in public wearing that?
M	HOWARD	I don't know. Why don't we just ask her?
F	SANDRA	Howard, don't. You'll embarrass me.
M	HOWARD	Audrey, honey? Your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world? The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
F	AUDREY	Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole. Good thing we stopped here. And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
M	HOWARD	I feel satisfied with that answer. I really do. Sandra buries her face in her hands.
F	SANDRA	I'm being punished for something, I know it. A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path. HEAVY BEATS thunder He passes a weathered road sign:
M	KYLE	Shit... He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead... Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
M	KYLE	Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man. He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way The good news is that he finds one. The bad news is that Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
M	KYLE	Hey... She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.
M	KYLE	You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby. She lets out a long slow exhale.
F	CHARLIE	Guess I should think `bout quittin' then.
M	KYLE	Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do.
F	CHARLIE	You can buy a whole pack inside.
M	KYLE	Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.
M	KYLE	Am I in the right place?
F	CHARLIE	Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are.
M	KYLE	Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that works?
F	CHARLIE	Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...And pay `im somethin'.
M	KYLE	I can handle that. You got pancakes here?
F	CHARLIE	Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though. You okay, Charlie? They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing
F	CHARLIE	Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
M	KYLE	Three seventy-five, huh? Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
F	CHARLIE	I hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that's all we got left.
M	KYLE	If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.
M	BOB (O.S.)	Where ya been, Charlie? Bob steps off the chair.
M	BOB	This ain't a resort you know. I got orders stacking up here. In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it
M	BOB	You best not be smokin' again. Not in your condition.
F	CHARLIE	Bob, do you see where am I right now? Can my condition really get any worse? `Sides, you ain't one to talk.
M	BOB	What? I quit two years ago.
F	CHARLIE	Yeah, so why you still carryin' that fancy lighter `round for?
M	BOB	It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright? I'm sentimental. I don't wanna forget how much I hate her guts.
M	KYLE	Hey man? Bob turns to Kyle. Doesn't like what he sees.
M	KYLE	Can I use your phone? My cell doesn't get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted. Bob is about to respond when: Excuse me...? Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's
M	HOWARD	Any news about when our truck might be fixed? You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago. The rate we're going, we'll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas. Bob's expression darkens at this news.
M	BOB	Goddamn it. Where the hell is Jeep? A cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of Hey, Leonardo...! Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to
M	BOB	The fact that this truck's hood's up mean anything to you? Jeep stares at the ground. Couldn't be anymore uncomfortable.
M	JEEP	Yeah...
M	BOB	Whaddya workin' on that's so goddamn important you're not doin' your job? Nothin'... Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.
M	JEEP	Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed. I know you never like to throw anything away... Bob considers him, softens.
M	BOB	Whaddya doin'?
M	JEEP	What...?
M	BOB	Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility.
M	JEEP	Oh whatever, leave me alone.
M	BOB	Don't walk away from me while I'm talkin' to you!
M	BOB	How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?! Jeep stiffens. Turns to his father:
M	JEEP	Don't say that about her! She's not like that! Bob gives Jeep a hard stare. Yeah, she is.
M	BOB	You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands? Jeeps shakes his head, burns.
M	JEEP	Look, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something I have to do. Bob sighs, feels for his boy.
M	BOB	See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, "just wait." Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station. But I was wrong. The freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost. And your mom? Well she got tired of waitin'.
M	JEEP	C'mon Dad. You can't blame yourself for what she did--
M	BOB	Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone. It's time for you to move on from this place, Jeep. I don't wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you're lost just like everybody else who stops here. Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily. A
M	BOB	Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a Kyle is about to address him again, when something else
M	BOB	Yeah, wait a minute. The TV has gone on the fritz again. Only now the image is Bob climbs back onto the chair. Faces the TV.
M	BOB	What's wrong with you today?
M	WHACK!	The image flickers but doesn't improve.
M	PERCY	I told you to get the satellite TV. But you don't wanna listen. What the hell do I need that crap for?
M	PERCY	History Channel, man!
M	BOB	I got all the history I can take.
F	CHARLIE	That's for sure.
M	BOB	What's your problem now?
F	CHARLIE	Where do I start?
M	BOB	You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it.
F	CHARLIE	Yeah, in the Fifties.
M	BOB	You shouldn't be watchin' anyways. Okay, baby, this is gonna do it. Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
M	BOB	See? Clear as day.
M	PERCY	Nice work, Bob. What the hell's that?
M	BOB	It's just one of those test things. That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the
M	"THIS IS NOT A TEST"	Bob switches the channels. All the same.
F	CHARLIE	Don't look like a test.
M	KYLE	Yo, am I the Invisible motherfuckin' Man here? Do you have a phone or not? Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.
M	BOB	In the back past the kitchen. Make it fast. Kyle hustles passed Percy. Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.
F	SANDRA	If there's a real emergency aren't they supposed to give us some information about what to do?
M	HOWARD	I'm sure it's a mistake.
M	BOB	Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a shot. Maybe they got some news about the TV. Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. STATIC. He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
M	KYLE (V.O.)	Let me talk to him... Cuz a father should be able to talk to his son, that's why. Now put `im on the phone. Is that my little man...? Yeah, well I'm working hard, so that I can be with you. You bein' good? Wait... You're breakin' up. Hello...? Shit! Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.
M	KYLE	What the hell... He keeps trying. Nothing.
M	HOWARD (V.O.)	Maybe there was an earthquake?
M	HOWARD	They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one.
M	PERCY	Lot a folks could be hurt.
M	BOB	Not if it was centered in the desert.
M	HOWARD	Exactly. Could be nothing to worry about.
F	SANDRA	So then why's the TV out?
M	HOWARD	Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren't those usually in remote areas?
M	BOB	Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off.
M	PERCY	There ain't no radiation comin' from those things. Plus that don't explain the radio being out too. Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. Any quake that big and we would a felt it.
F	CHARLIE	Percy's right. I didn't feel nothing.
F	AUDREY	Maybe it's a terrorist attack or something...?
F	SANDRA	Oh god... Everyone considers that grimly, then:
M	BOB	Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something. I don't think so. Kyle has reappeared in the diner.
M	BOB	Whaddya talkin' about?
M	KYLE	Phone's dead. Just tried to make a call.
M	BOB	You're shittin' me. Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.
F	SANDRA	Oh, this is just great.
M	BOB	Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines. Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your truck fixed up quick as can be, and then you'll be on your way.
M	JEEP	Damn it! He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands. The After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on He then looks toward the horizon again. The WALL OF DARK
F	CHARLIE	Have a seat wherever you want, Ma'am. Specials are on the board.
M	OLD WOMAN	Thank you, dear. The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons. Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:
M	OLD WOMAN	Oh, I already know what I want.
F	CHARLIE	Okay, what'll it be?
M	OLD WOMAN	I'll have the steak, please.
F	CHARLIE	And how'd you like that cooked?
M	OLD WOMAN	Rare if you would. And water, no ice.
F	CHARLIE	Coming right up.
M	OLD WOMAN	Charlie, is it?
F	CHARLIE	Yeah.
M	OLD WOMAN	What an unusual name for a girl.
F	CHARLIE	So they say. I'll be right back with your water. The old lady turns to the Andersons.
M	OLD WOMAN	Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.
F	SANDRA	Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm Sandra and this is my husband Howard.
F	GLADYS	What a nice young couple you are. What brings you out to these parts?
F	SANDRA	We're moving out to Scottsdale. But our truck broke down, and so we're stuck here while it's being fixed.
F	GLADYS	Oh, what a nuisance. A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head. She doesn't seem
F	SANDRA	Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are down around here. The phone and TV, you know? And I just was wondering if you might have heard something on your way up? You know, about what's going on? Gladys smiles strangely.
F	GLADYS	Oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart. It'll all be over soon. Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S Howard and Sandra exchange looks. Creepy.
M	JEEP	The carburetor's shot. Don't know why. Looks brand new.
M	BOB	Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.
M	JEEP	I could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and I don't think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning.
M	BOB	That's not gonna happen. Goddamn phone's out.
M	JEEP	What? Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front
F	GLADYS	Thank you, dear. How far along are you? Charlie rests a hand on her belly.
F	CHARLIE	Just about there.
F	GLADYS	The father must be very proud.
F	CHARLIE	I wouldn't know.
F	GLADYS	You mean he's...
F	CHARLIE	Out of sight. Out of mind.
F	GLADYS	Oh, I see. So you're not married, I take it? A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
F	CHARLIE	Nope. Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
F	GLADYS	That's too bad.
F	CHARLIE	No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do.
F	GLADYS	But what about the baby?
F	CHARLIE	I've got it under control.
F	GLADYS	Yeah, but it's gonna burn. Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well. Kyle
F	CHARLIE	What did you just say?
F	GLADYS	I said your fucking baby's gonna burn. Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.
F	CHARLIE	Go to hell, lady. She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
M	BOB	What happened?
F	CHARLIE	Total fucking Jesus freak. Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
F	GLADYS	All those babies. They're gonna burn.
F	SANDRA	Gladys, please. There's no reason to -- Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.
F	GLADYS	Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt! All you do is complain! Complain! Complain! Sandra covers her mouth in shock. Everybody in the diner is Howard gets up from the booth.
F	SANDRA	Howard, it's okay! Don't listen to her! But Howard's already standing over Gladys.
M	HOWARD	Who the hell do you think you are, lady?! Now, I'd like you to apologize to my -- EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.
F	GLADYS	You're all going to fucking die! Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK. Impossibly, Gladys is She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
M	BOB	Don't move! But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.
M	BOB	Fuck! Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE
M	ROOM!	The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He
M	PERCY	Shoot her, Jeep! Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.
F	GLADYS	You'll never save her. Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear Gladys rockets straight at him! But Jeep's too afraid to move. He clamps his eyes shut, A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an Jeep slowly opens his eyes. His gun's still cocked.
M	SANDRA (O.S.)	Somebody help me! Sandra is on the floor with her husband. Blood pours freely Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
M	KYLE	Press your hands over the hole! Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his
M	KYLE	Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death! Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to
M	BOB	The fuck was that?! What the fuck was that!? Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her
M	KYLE	How far to the hospital?
M	PERCY	Seventy, maybe eighty miles. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor
F	AUDREY	What's that on the road? Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally
M	KYLE	They're fuckin' clouds! What the fuck do they look like?
F	AUDREY	Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz. She's right. They're black... Undulating... BUZZING! Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield --
M	SPLAT!	And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds. The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening!
M	BOB	I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did. And did you see that kid's gun? The hell's he doin' with a gun like that? Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling.
M	BOB	It's okay, Jeep. It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay. He's hurting real bad inside.
M	JEEP	I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid... She could've killed you! Or Charlie...She would've killed me if it wasn't for... He can't get the words out. Bob rests a hand on his boy's
M	BOB	There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep. Not everybody can play the hero. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front
M	BOB	Where you going?!
M	PERCY	To get my bible! The hell you need that for?!
M	PERCY	Well somebody's gotta start prayin'... Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING. No one breathes.
M	PERCY	Okay, hold `em steady.
F	CHARLIE	Oh god, please don't throw up. Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound. Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
M	BOB	She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours. Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
M	KYLE	Well, I don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us.
M	BOB	I don't get it. Why don't they come closer?
M	KYLE	How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin' pestilence. A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped
M	JEEP	You guys!
M	GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME	Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE
M	BOB	You see anything?
M	KYLE	No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean. Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door. Unlocks it.
M	BOB	Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell
M	KYLE	Agh! What the fuck is that? Bob covers his nose.
M	BOB	Jesus. Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in. Dark, dirty. But
M	KYLE	Nothin' here.
M	JEEP	How `bout the trunk? They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR. Jeep slips the key The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS. ROTTING.
M	MAGGOT INFESTED.	Bob quickly slams the trunk closed. The guys are reeling Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.
M	KYLE	Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?!
M	BOB	Least now we know where that smell was coming from.
M	KYLE	Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man.
M	JEEP	Hey... They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.
M	BOB	Okay, now we're talkin'.
M	JEEP	Wait a minute. Check it out. It's LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way out here? Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.
M	KYLE	I'm from Nevada, man. They consider the police car a moment more. See the
M	BOB	Give me the shotgun. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.
F	CHARLIE	Oh, thank God, the police! The three men see her moving toward the car. Jeep's face
M	JEEP	Charlie, wait! The men begin to run toward her... While out of the police car steps...
M	MICHAEL	Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
M	BOB	Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. A long beat as Michael considers Bob. Icy cold.
M	MICHAEL	That how you greet all your customers?
M	BOB	Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. Michael stares at him blankly. Your teeth goddamn it! Lemme see `em! Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
M	JEEP	No, shark teeth, Pop. Bob lowers the gun.
M	BOB	Okay... Suppose you tell us your name then.
M	MICHAEL	Michael.
M	BOB	Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half. Michael remains silent. Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
M	BOB	So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car? Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
M	MICHAEL	You don't know, do you?
M	KYLE	Know what?
F	CHARLIE	We don't know anything. Nothing's working here. The TV, the radio, the phone... Michael just shakes his head.
M	MICHAEL	I'm running out of time. Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
M	BOB	Back off, fella... Now, I don't care if this is the second coming of Jesus fucking Christ, I say it's time for you to either get talkin' or get the hell outta here! In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
M	KYLE	Easy! Easy! Michael's expression is totally calm. Merciless.
M	JEEP	C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry. Tell `em you were only kidding! But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared. He squeezes his
F	CHARLIE	Let `em go! Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction. The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.
M	PERCY	Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna go spillin' blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people, do ya? Our friend Bob here ain't worth the trouble it'd cause ya. So whaddya say `bout just lettin' `im go and then you can be on your way? Nice `n' easy. But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea. It's not No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
M	KYLE	What the--? Michael turns, sees the lights.
M	MICHAEL	They're here. Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it
M	MICHAEL	You're going to need this. Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser. Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.
M	PERCY	Lord, have mercy. You ladies best get back inside.
F	SANDRA	What is it? What's happening? Who is this man? Why's he driving a police car?
F	AUDREY	Shut up, mom! Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.
M	BOB	Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea.
M	JEEP	Dad, I can handle it.
M	BOB	He's just a kid --
M	JEEP	I said, I can handle it! Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.
M	MICHAEL	He can handle it. He doesn't have a choice. Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
M	MICHAEL	If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say. He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie. He cocks a
M	MICHAEL	When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. Don't hesitate. Don't do anything brave. There's no safety. He gives her a hard look. She nods nervously. Trusting him Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the Percy follows. Then Charlie. Now it's only Jeep and his father left.
M	BOB	C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go! And Bob rushes into the diner. A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.
M	JEEP	Fuck it. And races after his father.
M	A DEAD BOLT	Thrown. Locking the diner door. Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields. Jeep races in, locks the back door. Then he pushes a desk in IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS The place is transformed. Locked up tight. The ROAR OF
M	HOWARD	Sandra? What's happening?
F	SANDRA	It's okay! Everything's okay! Sandra closes her eyes. Struggling to believe it.
M	BOB (V.O.)	Jeep, get the flashlights! Everybody just stay still! Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
M	KYLE	Where the hell did they go? Bob turns to Michael sharply.
M	BOB	Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting? Michael is about to answer, when:
M	PERCY	Listen! Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
M	PERCY	You hear what I'm hearing?
M	BOB	Yeah...The hell is that? The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
M	PERCY	It sounds almost like...
M	KYLE	Ice cream. TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the darkness. And sure enough, an
M	KYLE	You've got to be fuckin' kidding me.
M	MICHAEL	Alright. There's a safety switch on the side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks. The men quickly do as they're told.
M	MICHAEL	Now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? If you don't, you're going to blow your hand off. Understand? Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.
M	PERCY	The fuck y'all lookin' at me for? Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
M	HOWARD	Oh, honey, listen. It's the Ice Cream Man. Everyone aims their guns at the truck. Tense. MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him. On the roof, the men wait for something to happen. Ah, he don't look that bad. The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof. He heard.
M	KYLE	Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
M	MICHAEL	Get ready! And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on Michael keeps his aim. Waits. The CALLIOPE music continues
M	KYLE	Is that it? Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A
M	MICHAEL	Now! Shoot now! The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.
M	MICHAEL	Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows! The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions. From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
M	BOB	Shells! Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
M	BOB	Fuck! With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
M	PERCY	Bob! Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
M	PERCY	Grab my hand! Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
M	BOB	Gun!
M	BOB	Fuck off! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body
M	BOB	Pull me up! Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety. Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears. A few feet away, Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another. Trying to Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
M	PERCY	Come on, motherfuckers! Come on! Closer and closer the creatures come. Most are eviscerated SMASH! A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window. Glass, Audrey and Sandra SCREAM. Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
M	JEEP	Where is it?! Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
F	AUDREY	Mom! Open your eyes!
F	SANDRA	I can't! I can't! Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
F	SANDRA	Howard! Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
F	AUDREY	Daddy! The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age. Her skin is a deathly
M	TEENAGE GIRL	See what you made me do, mother!? Sandra screams, holds on.
F	SANDRA	No! Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
F	SANDRA	Howard! Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window, Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY There you are! And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie, Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
F	AUDREY	Daddy!
M	KYLE	They're running! We got `em! Kyle turns happily to Michael. Gone. Kyle looks around the Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
F	SANDRA	Let me go! He's alive! Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
F	SANDRA	He's alive!
M	MICHAEL	No... Not anymore. Sandra breaks down. As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain. She Jeep catches her arm to steady her. I'm okay. I'm fine. She glances back at Michael. He's watching her. Those eyes.
F	CHARLIE	Thanks...
M	MICHAEL	I told you not to do anything brave. Charlie doesn't know how to respond. She's about to say Kyle rushes into the room. A smile on his face.
M	KYLE	We got `em runnin'! Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his
M	KYLE	Where's Howard? No one responds. Sandra and Audrey are huddled together. Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
M	MICHAEL	Someone needs to be on the roof.
M	KYLE	I'll go. Bob grabs Kyle's arm.
M	BOB	Hold on. You better start talking. All eyes on Michael. These people want answers. Finally:
M	MICHAEL	The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood. The second time...he sent what you see outside. Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:
M	PERCY	You sayin' this is the Apocalypse...?
M	MICHAEL	I'm saying this is an extermination. Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest willed are the easiest to turn.
M	KYLE	Possessed by what? Demons?
M	MICHAEL	No...by angels. That silences the room.
M	PERCY	Son, I don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys. Michael looks squarely at Percy.
M	MICHAEL	That's where your book is wrong.
F	SANDRA	How come you know so much about them?
M	MICHAEL	I know because until last night, I was on their side.
M	JEEP	You mean you're... Michael considers Jeep, then:
M	MICHAEL	Not anymore... Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in God.
M	MICHAEL	That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either. Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.
M	PERCY	C'mon, Bob. Have you looked outside recently? Those aren't exactly our regular customers out there.
M	BOB	How do we know he didn't bring them here himself?
F	CHARLIE	He brings them here and then he saves us from them? You're a genius, Bob. Bob falls silent, confounded. Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.
F	AUDREY	So you're here to protect us?
M	MICHAEL	Not you... Her. Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.
F	CHARLIE	Me?! Why me?!
M	MICHAEL	Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving. In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can
F	CHARLIE	No way! But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes CHARLIE Jesus Christ...
M	MICHAEL	Exactly. Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is
M	JEEP	You're sayin' she's the mother of the Messiah?
M	BOB	Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed to be a vi--
F	CHARLIE	Go fuck yourself, Bob!
M	PERCY	Makes you wonder about Mary.
F	CHARLIE	Look, this is not possible! I'm just a waitress! I'm nobody! I can't give birth to the Savior of Mankind! I don't even own a car!
M	MICHAEL	None of that matters anymore. Either your child lives or Mankind dies.
M	KYLE	So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out?
M	MICHAEL	That's right.
F	CHARLIE	That can't be. I'm only eight months pregnant.
M	KYLE	Oh we're fucked. We are so fucked! How are we supposed to survive here for a month?
M	MICHAEL	We won't have to... At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.
F	CHARLIE	It's coming soon, isn't it? Michael nods. Charlie sways on her feet. Jeep rests a hand on her With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group
M	MICHAEL	If you want to live you'll do what I say. This first attack was a test of our strength. The next one will be a test of our weakness. Something much worse is on its way. Everyone exchanges terrified looks. Finally, Kyle steps
M	KYLE	Okay, what's your plan?
M	MICHAEL	We'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two. Jeep, go get some tools. We need to close up this window before somebody else goes out. Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he Percy scans the horizon. Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the
M	PERCY	They're out there. Sons of bitches. I can feel `em. Damn it's cold! Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"
M	KYLE	You were in the Army?
M	PERCY	Navy, two tours. But the second one didn't work out so well, so I didn't get to go back for a third. Suppose that makes me lucky in a way. Served with Bob, you know. That's how I ended up in this place.
M	KYLE	What was it like? Being in a war?
M	PERCY	Dark. Like this. Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45. Nervously switches
M	PERCY	So what's with that gun?
M	KYLE	What?
M	PERCY	Your piece. The one you killed grandma with. Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck.
M	KYLE	No. I uh -- keep it for protection.
M	PERCY	Protection from what?
M	KYLE	From people. Percy looks at him skeptically.
M	PERCY	People.
M	KYLE	Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know?
M	PERCY	Just regular people or uh...
M	KYLE	Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people.
M	PERCY	Irregular people then.
M	KYLE	I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what I'm sayin?
M	PERCY	So it's a work thing, is it?
M	KYLE	Exactly. Strictly business.
M	PERCY	This business of yours... You like it? Kyle's eyes narrow.
M	KYLE	Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do. Percy just stares at him, penetrating. Finally:
M	PERCY	When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square. Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to
M	THE SILVER ZIPPO	rolls between dirty fingers. Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
M	BOB	On the house. She looks up at him. Smiles weakly. Takes a sip.
F	SANDRA	Thanks.
M	BOB	You hungry?
F	SANDRA	Couldn't eat if my life depended on it.
M	BOB	Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on. Sandra takes another sip of beer. Considers it.
F	SANDRA	Never much cared for beer. Howard's the beer drinker in the family. The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her
M	JEEP	What did you do...you know, before you came here...? Michael considers the question a beat, then:
M	MICHAEL	I was a soldier, a general, in His army.
M	JEEP	Well, what changed? What made you leave?
M	MICHAEL	I was given an order I didn't believe in... He lost faith. I hadn't. Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.
M	JEEP	is over? Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:
M	MICHAEL	Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it. Michael picks up his gun.
M	MICHAEL	It's almost time for the next shift. Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,
F	SANDRA	Howard? But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is
M	VOICE	Sandra... Sandra freezes.
F	SANDRA	Who's there? A beat then:
M	VOICE	Sandra... Sandra spins around. Searching.
F	SANDRA	Howard? Is that you? It sure sounded like Howard.
M	VOICE	Help me... Please... This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from. Sandra
M	VOICE	Help me. Sandra... Sandra is stricken. What the hell is she going to do? Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door. NAILED
M	TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.	But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible Sandra goes slack with horror.
M	HOWARD	Help me, please! Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
F	SANDRA	Howard! Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
F	AUDREY	Mom! Kyle races to restrain Sandra.
F	SANDRA	Let me go! He's alive! Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.
M	RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...	Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below. Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and Howard is there. A few feet away. Alive.
F	SANDRA	Howard! And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL -- Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
F	CHARLIE	Percy? He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.
M	A SHEET	covering a body.
M	JEEP	We should get back out there...
M	BOB	Just gimme another minute with him, okay? Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead
M	SANDRA'S FACE	Catatonic. Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
F	AUDREY	Hey... CLEARER. Yes. It's a VOICE!
F	AUDREY	Hey! You guys, I think I got something here! Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around
M	RADIO VOICE	... battling has been fierce. The numbers of casualties are unknown but all indications are that they must be unimaginably large. If you're just joining us, we're getting some of the first bits of good news, if you can call it that, since this apocalypse began just twenty-four ago. A human militia has formed on the outskirts of Las Vegas and has begun to engage the enemy. Also down in the Four Corners area, we've been receiving unconfirmed reports of another resistance force gathering in Red Rock National in the northern Mojave Desert area.
M	JEEP	Red Rock...
F	CHARLIE	That can't be more than an hour up the highway from here.
F	AUDREY	Does that mean we can leave?
M	MICHAEL	No. We're not going anywhere.
M	BOB	What the hell are you talkin' about? This is our chance!
M	MICHAEL	We can't risk being on the move when the child comes. It's too dangerous. Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,
M	RADIO VOICE	... And as we fight this new enemy, may God give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who are already lost...
M	A CIGARETTE	being lit.
M	JEEP (O.S.)	Guess it's your turn not to sleep. Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.
F	CHARLIE	Hey... Jeep sees the strain on her face.
M	JEEP	You okay?
F	CHARLIE	You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah? Jeep smiles, nods.
F	CHARLIE	Crazy thing is...I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that? I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran. For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it like I'd planned. Then I'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I didn't have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me. A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:
M	JEEP	You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will. She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:
F	CHARLIE	How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? Jeep's face hardens. He gets up. Hurt. Frustrated.
M	JEEP	You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself. And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare
M	KYLE	...Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety.
F	AUDREY	Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks. She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding Off Kyle's surprised look:
F	AUDREY	Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a thing for guns. Parents hated him.
M	KYLE	I bet they did. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on. Hands Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her
F	AUDREY	My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving.
M	KYLE	Yeah?
F	AUDREY	They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club. Kyle considers her thoughtfully.
M	KYLE	The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did?
F	AUDREY	What?
M	KYLE	I got really good at being bad. She smiles at this confession. Can obviously relate. He She leans in. Kisses him. Passionately. Desperately. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC. Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.
M	BOB	We back in business?
M	MICHAEL	I don't think so.
F	AUDREY	Is it over?
M	KYLE	I don't know. HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.
M	KYLE	You better get downstairs.
F	AUDREY	No, I can handle it. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face. Then he
M	KYLE	Just in case. The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
M	KYLE	Get ready. They aim their weapons at the vehicle. He races around to the gas pump.
M	KYLE	Wait a minute.
F	AUDREY	Kyle, are they... A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
M	KYLE	It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap! Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.
M	KYLE AND AUDREY	Hey! Get back in your car! It's a trap! But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING Kyle fires his gun in the air. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
F	AUDREY	They're not gonna make it. The father dashes to the driver's side. He throws open the But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
F	AUDREY	Wait! You'll hit them too! So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
F	AUDREY	Kyle! Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
M	BOB	Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'!
F	CHARLIE	We have to get `im back in here! Bob springs into action. Pushes the booth away from the The sound of a gun COCKING. Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.
M	MICHAEL	Don't. You open that door and we could all be dead. He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.
M	KYLE	I got you! Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening. Mister... Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms. GHOSTLY WHITE EYES Fooled ya. Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.
F	AUDREY	Kyle!
M	BOB	Damn it all to hell!
F	CHARLIE	Oh, no. Audrey... Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears
M	YOUNG BOY	I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!
F	AUDREY	Fuck you! Audrey raises the 45 and ... CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.
M	YOUNG BOY	You're gonna die now. The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body. They're everywhere. She's trapped.
M	Panic.	Charlie rushes to Michael's side.
F	CHARLIE	Do you have no heart?! She's just a kid! But he's immovable.
F	CHARLIE	You can't let her die! I swear if you don't do something, I will! Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door.
M	MICHAEL	Wait. Charlie looks back at him, defiant. No one breathes. Then:
M	MICHAEL	Open the door. Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait, Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED
M	MICHAEL	Come with me. Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...
M	MICHAEL	Run. Michael is almost there. But the fire is faster, ENGULFING
F	CHARLIE	Michael!
M	BOB	Get back! BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS Audrey's coughing from the smoke.
F	CHARLIE	I'll get some water! Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. She fills up She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher... The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room
M	YOUNG BOY	C'mon, don't be scared. I just wanna play with your baby. That's it. She's backed against the end of the counter! Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in The knife CLATTERS to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
M	MICHAEL	Are you hurt? Charlie shakes her head no.
F	CHARLIE	Where is he?! That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE
M	JEEP'S VOICE	He's still in here! FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.
M	BOB'S VOICE	Where the fuck is he?! A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST. Everybody spins to track As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND. A TRAIL OF
M	JEEP	He's bleeding! Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD
M	BOB	What the fuck? Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly
M	JEEP	Dad! Jeep can't get a clear shot. Bob's gasping for air.
M	MICHAEL	Get ready! Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
F	CHARLIE	Oh, no! Michael lowers his flashlight. CLEAR FLUID runs down TITLE: "December 25th - 3:33am" The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:
F	AUDREY	What am I supposed to do? Just `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I automatically know how to do this!
M	MICHAEL	Just do as I say.
F	AUDREY	Yeah, but, how do you know how to do this?! The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.
M	BOB	What a way to bring a child into the world. She ever tell you his name?
M	JEEP	She's never said. I just assumed it was Joe Danvers. You know how she's always had a thing for bad boys. Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.
M	BOB	Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her.
M	JEEP	I thought you said I should move on?
M	BOB	Can't a father be wrong sometimes? Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...
M	JEEP	What was that...? The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
F	AUDREY	What is that?!
M	MICHAEL	He's coming. We have to hurry.
F	AUDREY	Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry? This isn't something you can exactly hurry, is it?
M	MICHAEL	Charlie, I need you to push. I need you to push as hard as you can.
F	AUDREY	Michael, who's coming?! Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with
M	MICHAEL	We're almost there...
M	JEEP	We're not gonna make it outta here, are we? Bob looks at his son. The agony stretched across his face.
M	BOB	I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be happening to you... Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob ...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES. Audrey, eyes wide, holds
F	AUDREY	Oh my god...we did it! Charlie, you did it! Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the It's okay. The baby's okay. Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.
F	CHARLIE	I don't...I... Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.
M	MICHAEL	Take him... Give her a minute. Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to It's okay...It's okay...Shhh... Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS. Menacing. Audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
F	CHARLIE	So are we safe now? Is it over?
M	MICHAEL	No. Killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun. Now, at least, he will have a chance to grow up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness. Those words provide her little comfort.
F	CHARLIE	And what happens until then...?
M	MICHAEL	You'll need to teach him how. Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.
F	CHARLIE	What makes you think I can do that? What makes you think I want to do that? If he's so important, why don't you take him?
M	MICHAEL	Each of us has a burden. This one is yours and yours alone. Maybe someday you'll understand what that means. Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
F	AUDREY	Mama? Can you hear me? We did it...The baby's alive. Mama? If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face. DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.
M	HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP	In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.
M	JEEP	Something's happening. They're moving away.
M	MICHAEL	The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can. Someone like me.
M	BOB	Who?
M	MICHAEL	Gabriel. My lieutenant. He's come to do what I wouldn't. ON JEEP as the realization hits him.
M	JEEP	Your orders... Michael looks at Jeep.
M	JEEP	You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? That was the order you didn't obey. Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael.
F	CHARLIE	What's he talking about? The baby CRIES LOUDER.
F	CHARLIE	Michael, what the hell's he talking about?!
M	MICHAEL	There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.
F	CHARLIE	Audrey...? Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...
F	SANDRA	Stay away from me! Don't come any closer!
F	AUDREY	Mom!
M	BOB	Don't do it, lady!
F	SANDRA	You heard what he said. They just want the baby. Maybe if we just give it to them, then they'll let us go! Michael cocks his gun. Points it at Sandra.
F	CHARLIE	Give him to me!
F	SANDRA	Why?! You never wanted him in the first place! Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
F	CHARLIE	No... I... Sandra is almost to the front door.
F	SANDRA	It's just one baby. Just one. Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her Michael fires again. Blowing Sandra's body back through the Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air. Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the His name is GABRIEL. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
M	BOB (O.S.)	Sonuvabitch! Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing. But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face. Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.
M	JEEP	No! With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
M	MICHAEL	No, Jeep! You must protect the child now!
M	JEEP	Me?! What about you?
M	MICHAEL	My path ends here. You are the true protector. You always have been. Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.
M	JEEP	But I don't know what to do!
M	MICHAEL	Find the Prophets. Learn to read the instructions. Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
M	JEEP	Prophets? What Prophets? What instructions?! And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
M	JEEP	C'mon!
F	CHARLIE	Wait! We can't leave him!
M	JEEP	We have no choice! We have to get to Red Rock! He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office. Jeep is terrified.
M	JEEP	Dad! Jeep tries to help him up.
M	BOB	Leave me, Jeep. My place is here, remember?
M	JEEP	But Dad...! Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:
M	BOB	Run. And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.
M	MICHAEL	I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You were always so eager to please Him.
M	GABRIEL	Unlike you...the rebellious son. Pity about your wings. They would have helped you now.
M	MICHAEL	To not feel their burden...is a dream.
M	GABRIEL	You think you can defy Him and not pay the price?
M	MICHAEL	The child lives. What happens to me doesn't matter now.
M	GABRIEL	Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape. And neither will you, brother. Michael slowly approaches Gabriel. I'm not running anymore. Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face. This was not Join with me. You don't need do this. There's another way. A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.
M	GABRIEL	There is no other way... He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! -- And the fight begins. It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest, Michael thrusts himself to his feet. Gabriel recovers, jabs Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support Gabriel is rattled back by the assault. He clumsily lifts Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones. Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back. Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat It's in. Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.
F	CHARLIE	Come on, Jeep!
M	JEEP	I'm trying! Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING. Charlie screams.
M	JEEP	Fuck! Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!
M	JEEP	Hang on! Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full Pedal to the metal. BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.
M	JEEP	Okay, we need to figure out our weapon situation. Hopefully Michael didn't take everything out of the car. Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a
F	CHARLIE	Is this what I think it is?
M	JEEP	Yes. Now just put it down... Slowly. Charlie places it onto the seat. Audrey fishes around in the backseat.
F	AUDREY	Okay, all I got is a flare gun thing. Looks like we got a box of flares to go with it.
M	JEEP	Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A a flare gun... And a grenade. Alright. Load this. Audrey, can you figure out how to load that flare gun without killing us all?
F	AUDREY	I can try.
M	JEEP	Try real hard, okay? Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun. Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward. Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly Michael falls to his knees. Weakening.
M	GABRIEL	You always wanted to live like one of them...Now you'll know how it feels to die like one of them. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head. The mace comes swinging down...
F	AUDREY	Go faster!
M	JEEP	I can't fuckin' see! Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby.
M	JEEP	Oh, no. The INTRICATE WRITING is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm,
F	CHARLIE	Jeep, your arm! Jeep sees it, eyes go wide.
F	CHARLIE	What is it? A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words...
M	JEEP	The instructions... Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
M	BOB	Sorry... We're closed. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes.
F	CHARLIE	The swarm, it's fading! Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM
M	JEEP	Thank you...
M	JEEP	Oh, shit! The cruiser charges on down the endless highway, burning bits
F	AUDREY	I can't believe it. Is it really over...? Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead.
M	JEEP	No...It's just starting...
M	Burning wreckage everywhere.	DRIFTING THROUGH IT until we settle on the SPIKE-SCEPTER
M	JEEP	Better not hold him too long. Might get attached. Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger.
F	CHARLIE	Look, I'm sorry for what I said to you earlier, `bout you following me around. I didn't mean it.
M	JEEP	Nothin' to be sorry about. It's true. I did follow you around. At least now I know there was a good reason. Charlie's reacts, a bit stung. Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned
F	AUDREY	We're here. She points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says:
M	JEEP	Okay, all we gotta do is -- The roof buckles above them. The windows BLOW OUT.
F	AUDREY	Jeep! Jeep swings the gun around.
M	JEEP	Duck! BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow
M	JEEP	Audrey, the flare gun! Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE. Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.
M	JEEP	Get down on the floor! Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in Jeep PUNCHES IT. The speedometer leaps ahead. Gabriel's now completely in the car. They're helpless.
M	AUDREY (O.S.)	Get off her, you fucking asshole! Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just
F	AUDREY	Do it, Jeep! Do it now! This ride is over. Charlie crawls up from the floor.
F	CHARLIE	C'mon, Jeep! He tries to focus on her.
F	CHARLIE	Jeep! She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.
M	JEEP	The baby?
F	CHARLIE	Alive.
M	JEEP	And what about...
F	CHARLIE	Nothing could have survived that. Audrey...
F	CHARLIE	She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go! Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from Charlie looks up. STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky. Breathtaking.
F	CHARLIE	How can this happen?
M	JEEP	What?
F	CHARLIE	How can this happen in a world so beautiful? Jeep follows her gaze to the sky. Endless stars. Confounding. Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.
M	JEEP	C'mon, we're almost there. They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when -- Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt. Raises his Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
M	GABRIEL	So brave. So pointless. You should have worried more about saving yourself. Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
F	CHARLIE	Stop! Please! Don't kill him! But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
M	GABRIEL	Go to sleep... Jeep's eyes flutter. He's almost gone. Stop it! I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY! This gets Gabriel's attention. Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
F	CHARLIE	I don't want this responsibility! Tears run down her face. She's dead fucking serious.
M	JEEP	Charlie, no! Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.
M	GABRIEL	"And as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world." He peels the cloth back, revealing...
M	THE GRENADE.	He spins around to face Charlie. She's holding the pin.
M	GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.	The creature is gone at last. The sound of a BABY COOING. Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
M	JEEP	We made it.
F	CHARLIE	Yep, we sure did. And now we see it too: Vast. Barren. No signs of life. No resistance force. No nothing.
M	ON JEEP AND CHARLIE	Taking it in. Breathing hard.
M	JEEP	I'm sure they're just over the next ridge. He glances at Charlie. Worry in her eyes.
F	CHARLIE	What if we're on our own now?
M	JEEP	Don't be afraid. We'll be okay. Believe me. At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes. Sees a And she leans in and kisses him. Tender. And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The And we're back where we started. A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE. Solemn. Weary. Determined. IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Someday when my son is older, I will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered in a great darkness...
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	... And how just at the moment when everything seemed lost... Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	...a mighty warrior fell in order to save me. Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby. He smiles at the
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	And a boy faced his fear and rose up to save us all. The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with
