M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	STARLA	When Darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait -- he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their environment.
F	STARLA	We humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter. But we're neophytes. We've been around two million years, give or take. The cockroach has been here for 350 million. You tell me who's the more successful species.
F	STARLA	Will.
M	WILL	How's all this go with how the Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?
F	STARLA	We'll tackle that tomorrow... Everyone bring your boxing gloves.
M	JACK	Get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker!
M	MOTHER	Mornin', Mayor.
F	KYLIE	Prolly go find it later, sell it on eBay.
F	GRANT	Just a tremor, boys.
M	TREVOR	Did ya' feel that?!
M	TREVOR	I always get afraid when that happens, 'cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside? It's so hot in there you get all burnt to nothin' like that -- Happened to my uncle Barry.
M	WALLY	Who told you that story, Trevor?
M	TREVOR	My aunt.
M	BILL	Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in Winnsboro.
F	SHELBY	Chief! We got a 'mergency over at the diner!
M	WAITRESS	Back there, Bill!
M	WAITRESS	She slipped in, was eating trash. We seen it on TV, how they kill ya'--
M	BILL	Right.
M	WAITRESS	So we thought we best call in.
M	BILL	Come on now, honey, door's this way.
F	MARGARET	It's open season. Let's shoot her.
M	BILL	She's just scared, Margaret.
M	WALLY	Also, Bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets.
M	BILL	She ain't a bull, Trevor!
F	MARGARET	Goddamn bambi-rat!
M	BILL	Get back.
M	BILL	It's okay, sweetheart. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
M	BILL	That's right. Just gonna pull this cord out. It's gonna be all right.
M	BILL	Hell, she took a phone. Now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night.
M	WALLY	Chief of police there? This a squirrel. Bring me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker!
M	SECRETARY	'Night, Mr. Grant.
F	GRANT	See ya', Ashley.
M	GRANT (O.S.)	So I get home today, phone's ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.
F	GRANT	Callin' for you. What the hell? I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit outta line don't'cha think, a single man callin' someone's wife?' At night, nonetheless.
F	STARLA	He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
F	GRANT	Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
F	STARLA	It's just a work thing.
F	GRANT	Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
F	GRANT	I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're lucky you got me. You're too damn trusting. Without me to protect you, you'd get kilt one of these days.
M	GRANT (O.S.)	Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
F	STARLA	Just a second.
F	STARLA	Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood.
F	GRANT	Come on, baby, it's --
F	STARLA	I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
F	GRANT	Sure you do.
F	GRANT	Flip.
F	GRANT	Flip.
F	STARLA	That's disrespectful.
F	GRANT	When are you in the mood, exactly? Seems to me that mood's as rare as winnin' the Goddamn lotto.
F	STARLA	Where are you going?
F	GRANT	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
F	STARLA	That's not true -- Where are you-?
F	GRANT	Out.
F	GRANT	Hit me again there, killer.
M	BARKEEP	Hey, Grant, how's it you come to have the same last name as first?
F	GRANT	Parents thought it sounded pleasant, I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?
F	BRENDA	Megan Halesy' little sister.
F	GRANT	Shit. You're kidding me.
F	BRENDA	Nope. Brenda!
F	GRANT	Hell, you were --
F	BRENDA	I was! And I'll tell you somethin', Grant Grant. I's in love with you.
F	BRENDA	My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
F	GRANT	Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
F	BRENDA	Hell, I was game!
F	GRANT	Who's the lucky fella?
F	BRENDA	Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half-Mexican.
F	GRANT	Already ain't. Married a gal named --
F	BRENDA	Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
F	GRANT	Yeah.
F	BRENDA	Where you goin'?
F	GRANT	Starla, she gets real worried 'bout me I stay out too late. Loves me too much, that one.
F	GRANT	What the...?
F	GRANT	Hey, anybody 'round here? 'Lo?
F	GRANT	Ow! Fuck!
M	CAMPER	Over here!
M	CAMPER	Hey, man. You all right?... Dude?... Oh shit.
M	CAMPER	I think he's d --
F	GRANT	It's taking... my... brain.
M	CAMPER	Buddy?
M	CAMPER	You all right, man?
M	CAMPER	That might of been a stroke, buddy. You better take it easy. Hey ya', Grant.
M	NEIGHBOR	What were ya', night-fishing again? You catch anything?
F	GRANT	I caught a little somethin', yeah.
F	GRANT	Hey there, sugarplum.
F	STARLA	Haven't heard this for a while.
F	STARLA	I never danced in a towel before.
F	GRANT	Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
F	GRANT	I'm sorry about last night. I get a little insecure sometimes, want to hold on too tight. It's just 'cause you're precious to me, Starla.
M	GRANT (CONT'D)	But I swear to God, baby, I'm turning over a new Goddamn leaf. Okay?
F	GRANT	I love you, sugarplum.
F	STARLA	Grant, what's that?
F	GRANT	Just a little bug bite is all.
F	JANENE	What are you so smiley about, girl?
F	STARLA	Oh, nothin'.
F	STARLA	Just, Grant and I had a nice morning. It's been a while.
F	JANENE	Oh! You got that fresh-fucked glow, don't you?
F	STARLA	Janene.
F	JANENE	You slut.
F	STARLA	Hush.
F	JANENE	No shame. You're a married woman.
F	STARLA	He was... considerate. Maybe this is the start of a real change in Grant.
F	GRANT	Meat.
F	GRANT	Meat.
M	BUTCHER	Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
F	GRANT	Sure thing, killer.
M	BUTCHER	What can I do you for?
F	GRANT	Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
M	BUTCHER	How many you need?
F	GRANT	Well... having us a little dinner party... I'd say... eight. No, no... fourteen...
F	GRANT	Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
M	BUTCHER	All the rib eyes?
F	GRANT	Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
F	GRANT	Meat.
F	GRANT	You're meat.
F	GRANT	Welcome home.
F	STARLA	Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
F	STARLA	You drilled into the driveway.
F	GRANT	Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
F	STARLA	My present?
F	GRANT	You're my princess, aren't you?
F	STARLA	Okay.
F	GRANT	I got a super-special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
F	STARLA	All right... I have to clean up before dinner.
F	GRANT	You're meat.
F	STARLA	What?
F	GRANT	Oh, nothin'. Nothin'. See you in a sec.
F	GRANT	Meat.
F	STARLA	Roscoe's gone?
M	BOY	You haven't seen him, have you?
F	STARLA	I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
F	STARLA	Grant, are you almost ready?
F	GRANT	Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
F	STARLA	What are you doing?
F	GRANT	You're pretty.
F	GRANT	Who's that?
F	STARLA	It's just one of my students, Grant.
M	TREVOR	What's she see in that douchebag?
M	BILL	That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
F	MARGARET	Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt-poor.
M	TREVOR	Gold-digger, huh?
M	BILL	Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
M	JACK	Bill, you're Chief of police now.
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
M	BILL	You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
F	STARLA	Janene!
F	JANENE	Hey, Grant.
F	GRANT	Why don't you two catch up? I'll go see what the boys are doing.
F	STARLA	He's been strange the past couple days. Hey there, handsome.
F	BRENDA	Must be fate, us meeting again like this.
F	GRANT	Well, you might be right...
F	GRANT	You're lookin' awful pretty.
F	BRENDA	Shut up.
F	GRANT	Where's the old half-Mexican?
F	BRENDA	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
F	BRENDA	Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
F	GRANT	Take off your shirt, doll.
F	GRANT	Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
F	BRENDA	What?
F	GRANT	Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
F	GRANT	Nice.
F	BRENDA	Grant!? What -- ?!
F	BRENDA	No, no, we --
F	STARLA	Hey, Bill!
M	BILL	Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
F	STARLA	That's not funny.
M	BILL	Sorry.
F	STARLA	Whatcha' doin'?
M	BILL	Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
M	BILL	What you up to?
F	STARLA	Just checking out the lights.
M	BILL	Pretty, ain't they?
F	STARLA	I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
M	BILL	Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
M	BILL	There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
F	STARLA	Oh, yeah?
M	BILL	Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
F	STARLA	I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
M	BILL	Oh, will you now?
M	STARLA GRANT (O.S.)	Or Rollo's ghost. Starla.
F	STARLA	Grant, where'd you go?
M	BILL	Hey, Grant.
F	GRANT	You ready, sugarplum?
F	STARLA	Bye.
M	WALLY	Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
M	BILL	Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
M	WALLY	What?
M	BILL	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
F	MARGARET	Sir, may I help -- ?
M	BRENDA'S HUSBAND	My wife, Brenda. I think something has happened to her!
F	STARLA	Grant?
F	STARLA	Damn fuse.
F	STARLA	Grant?
F	STARLA	Grant, where are y -- ?
F	STARLA	Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
F	GRANT	Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
F	GRANT	Don't look at me like that, baby. Please? I'm gonna go get my... prescription filled.
F	STARLA	I'll get if for you.
F	GRANT	No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
F	BRENDA	Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
F	GRANT	Brought you munchies.
F	GRANT	Been saving for a rainy day.
F	BRENDA	Grant, I'm sorry if I did something wrong! I think I gotta -- I think I should go to a hospital!
M	WALLY	Grant around?
F	STARLA	No. He went to the pharmacy.
M	WALLY	Pharmacy?
F	STARLA	He's got a... rash.
M	BILL	Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
M	BILL	Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
F	STARLA	No. What...?
M	BILL	She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
M	WALLY	Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
M	BILL	The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
M	BILL	The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks.
M	BILL	Have him call me right away, okay?
M	SHERRY (O.S.)	You've reached Chief Pardy at the Wheelsy Police Department. Please leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible.
F	STARLA	Bill, it's Starla!
F	STARLA	It's -- I think you better come over right away -- I think Grant's sick, he --
F	GRANT	Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
F	STARLA	Grant, no!
F	GRANT	I loved you. I loved --
F	STARLA	Grant, you're sick!
F	GRANT	I wanted you by my side, but you -- I can't trust you now!
F	STARLA	Noooo!
M	BILL (O.S.)	Starla?!! Starla, are you in there?!
M	BILL (O.S.)	Starla?!
M	TREVOR	Fuck!
M	PASTOR (O.S.)	Jesus, these past few days have been a trying time for us.
M	PASTOR (O.S.)	We ask you now for the safe return of our beloved Brenda.
M	PASTOR	Our sister. Our daughter. Our mother. Our wife.
M	PASTOR	And we ask that you keep your light alive in her heart, wherever she may be. We ask all this in your name, Lord. Amen
M	BILL CONGREGATION	Amen. Amen. Starla.
M	BILL	I talked to the CDC. They didn't have nothin' on file consistent with Grant's... symptoms.
F	STARLA	How about Brenda?
M	BILL	New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
M	BILL	You all right?
F	STARLA	Yeah.
M	JACK	Bill!
M	BILL	Shit.
M	JACK	Bill, we need to talk!
M	BILL	'Mornin', Jack.
M	JACK	Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
M	BILL	Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
M	JACK	Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
M	BILL	Don't worry, we'll find him. Anything new?
M	JACK	How are you going to find him?
M	BILL	Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
M	JACK	That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
M	BILL	Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
M	SHERRY	Not today, Bill.
M	JACK	Still, quit that talk! You yourself said it was dark in there! You don't know what you saw!
M	TREVOR	We saw his arm was all bendy.
M	JACK	Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
M	BILL	What?
M	JACK	Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
M	BILL	And that makes you look like a squid?
M	JACK	I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
M	JACK	Well, screw you all for laughin'.
M	SHELBY (O.S.)	Bill!
F	SHELBY	Another ranch attack! Up at the Castavets'.
M	JACK	'Ranch a -'? What 'ranch attacks'? It looks like one of them psyche tests. What do they call it?
M	BILL	Rorschach.
M	WALLY	What do you see? I see a butterfly.
M	BILL	I see we're fucked. Three ranches in three days.
F	MARGARET	So, I think I got it part-way figured. You want to hear it?
F	MARGARET	So Grant -- I mean, we're saying this is Grant, right?
F	MARGARET	Grant kills a cow right about here. See there's the blood, musta slit its neck.
F	MARGARET	So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
M	TREVOR (O.S.)	Hey, look!
M	TREVOR	He knocked this'n's head clear over here!
M	WALLY	Put that down, numbnuts!
F	MARGARET	So the dogs attacked, somehow he slew 'em all, and he stole off with the cow into the forest.
M	BILL	He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
M	TREVOR	Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
M	WALLY	It's a hundred thousand acres. Be finding a needle in a fuckstack.
M	BILL	Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together. I think I know where he's gonna hit next.
M	BILL	So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch.
M	BILL	Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate.
M	WALLY	Looks like a chipmunk.
M	BILL	Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
M	BILL	And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit-storm took place.
M	TREVOR	I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
M	BILL	And if he sticks to that pattern he'll be here next. Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers'. Now I know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families. But we're gonna have to go there tonight, lie low and wait.
M	REDNECK	Let's get that son-of-a-bitch, Chief.
M	BILL	Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here. So let's be careful.
M	TREVOR	Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we confiscated from them jokers wanted to use it fish for trout?
M	BILL	Can't hurt.
M	JACK	I didn't know the Russkies were invading there, folks.
F	MARGARET	You seen this guy, you'd wished they was.
F	STARLA	Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
M	BILL	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
F	STARLA	Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
M	BILL	He tried to kill you, Starla.
F	STARLA	He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
F	STARLA	Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
M	BILL	Starla, it ain't --
F	STARLA	It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Kylie! What'd you do to your fingers?
F	KYLIE	Kiri Goshima done 'em. She's Japanese.
M	KYLIE'S DAD	Looks like Pokemons done 'em to me!
F	KYLIE	Foreign stuff is classy if you knew something.
M	KYLIE'S DAD	Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all to stay inside tonight. All right?
M	JACK	This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots.
M	REDNECK	Didn't know it was date night.
M	REDNECK	I'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Charlie.
M	GOOD OL' BOY	Shut up.
M	BILL	Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night?
M	BILL	Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along.
M	BILL	I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.'
M	WALLY	How far'd you get?
F	STARLA	About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called my dad.
M	WALLY	Ha! A cop from the get-go! You son-of-a-bitch!
F	STARLA	You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy.
M	BILL	Yeah, maybe I did.
F	STARLA	Grant?
M	JACK	You said 'squid'!
M	TREVOR	It got worse.
M	WALLY	What we gonna do now, Bill? Cuffs won't even fit on 'im.
M	BILL	Starla, where you...?
F	STARLA	Grant?
F	STARLA	Grant? It's okay.
F	STARLA	You're just sick is all. But we'll take you to get help right now. I'll stay by your side, Grant, just like I swore I would. For better or worse. Remember?
F	STARLA	Okay?
F	STARLA	Okay, Grant? It's gonna be all right.
M	GOOD OL' BOY	You stop right there, you son of a bitch. I don't care what kinda leprosy you got. We need to find that girl. Now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard.
M	BILL	Fire! Fire!
M	WALLY	There he is! Over there!
M	TREVOR	Where'd he go?
F	MARGARET	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
M	REDNECK	I'll kill that asshole what he did to Charlie.
M	BILL	Starla, get the hell out of here!
F	MARGARET	Bill!!
M	TREVOR	What the hell's that smell?
M	WALLY	It's something dead.
M	JACK	It's coming from in there, ain't it?
F	MARGARET	Think he's inside?
M	BILL	Oh...
M	OLDER COP	Oh, shit!
F	BRENDA	Something's wrong with me.
M	WALLY	Uh, yeah.
M	BILL	Brenda, um...
F	BRENDA	I didn't want no one to be seeing me like this.
F	BRENDA	How are my boys, Bill? Are they all right?
M	BILL	Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's -- what's happening here, exactly?
F	BRENDA	I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm so hungry. I just never knew anybody could be so hungry.
F	BRENDA	Would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet? Little bit?
M	BILL	I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
M	WALLY	What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
M	OLDER COP	Why's she doing that?!
M	REDNECK	Her tumors is moving.
M	JACK	Bill, get her to stop that shit!
F	BRENDA	It hurts!
F	BRENDA	Help me!! Help!!
F	STARLA	Bill!
F	BRENDA	Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !
M	BILL	He led us here.
M	BILL	Margaret, cover your mouth!
M	BILL	Don't let 'em in your mouths!
M	TREVOR	They wanted us to eat 'em! Why would they want that!?
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Kylie! You're gonna turn into a plum in there!
F	KYLIE	Prune, Mom. Plums turn into prunes.
M	KYLIE'S MOM	I know what turns into what. You got school tomorrow. Finish up in there and get to bed.
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Time to turn in, ladies.
M	KYLIE'S SISTER 1	Just a couple more pages, Mom?
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Come on now.
M	KYLIE'S MOM	G'night.
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite.
F	KYLIE	Mom!!
F	KYLIE	Mom!!!
F	KYLIE	Mom!! Mom!!!
F	KYLIE	Emily!! Jenna!!
F	KYLIE	No!! Nooo!!
M	BILL	out here right away. We got four men down.
M	BILL	Shelby, you there?
M	BILL	Shelby, this is Bill. We got an emergency here.
M	BILL	Goddammit.
M	BILL	Shelby?
F	MARGARET	Is he alive?
F	MARGARET	Praise Jesus.
M	TREVOR	'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
M	TREVOR	What the hell were those things?! You ever seen anything like that? You ever heard of anything like that?
M	TREVOR	Me neither. And I watch 'Animal Planet' all the fuckin' time!
M	BILL	No reception out here.
F	STARLA	Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
F	MARGARET	That's a long ways. Them worms are out there.
F	STARLA	I'll keep my mouth covered.
M	BILL	No. I'll go. The three of you, you wait here. Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em.
F	STARLA	Be careful, Bill.
M	TREVOR	It's got to be some Goddamn biological weapons. Government's testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears, right?!
M	TREVOR	I hope it ain't contagious. I'll be pissed as hell I turn into a big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I swear to God.
M	WALLY	Hey, sugarplum.
F	STARLA	What?
M	WALLY	Marriage. It's a sacred bond. Just like you said.
M	WALLY	I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle you and all. I lost -- Lost my head. I didn't want to do none of the things I done. Not kill them pets. Not make Brenda a womb. But it's my nature, ain't it? How can you blame a one for actin' according to his nature?
M	WALLY	I wanted to tell you what was going on. But I didn't - didn't think you'd love me no more. I never knew... love, Starla, I --
F	MARGARET	Wally?
F	MARGARET	You all right?
F	MARGARET	Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
M	TREVOR	Margaret.
M	KYLIE'S DAD	Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on out.
M	KYLIE'S SISTER 2	Hi, Kylie. It's me.
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Open the door, sweetie. I know we don't look so good, but your mommy and daddy love you.
F	KYLIE	Get away!!
M	KYLIE'S MOM	Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why not to be with your family. This is family fun day, isn't it?
M	KYLIE'S SISTER 1	Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha- ance.
M	BILL	Hey!
M	BILL	What's -- ?
M	BILL	What's going on here?
M	KYLIE'S DAD	Well, hello there, Pardy.
M	BILL	What happened to you, Dwight?
M	KYLIE'S DAD	Poison ivy out back, maybe?
M	KYLIE'S SISTERS	We're itchy!
F	KYLIE	They're not my... They killed...
M	BILL	Okay. Y'all just wait in this spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics for you. Kylie can come with --
M	RANCHER (O.S.)	Hey there, killer.

F	MARGARET	Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just sit down! You need to get some Goddamn rest! You're sick!
M	TREVOR	Let go!!
F	MARGARET	It burns!!
F	MARGARET	What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
M	OLDER COP	Meat. Let him go!
F	STARLA	Trevor, come on.
F	STARLA	
M	JACK	There you go, sugarplum! Why you choosing camps 'fore you hear --
M	JACK REDNECK	Both sides of the story!? Both sides of the story!?
F	STARLA	Why are you talking like Grant?!
M	WALLY	'Cause I am Grant!
M	WALLY REDNECK	I'm you husband -- I'm you husband, Goddammit --
M	JACK	You swore to honor and obey --
M	OLDER COP REDNECK	Obey me -- Obey me, so put that Goddamn gun down.
F	STARLA	Don't come any closer. I'll... shoot.
M	WALLY	You ain't gonna shoot me! You always needed me to protect you! You for damn sure ain't got the balls to --
M	TREVOR	Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
M	BILL	Shit. Ammo's in the trunk.
M	BILL	Trevor! Margaret!
M	TREVOR	They killed Margaret!
M	BILL	Where are you?!
M	TREVOR (O.S.)	We're coming your way, man!
F	KYLIE	Go! Go! Please!
M	BILL	My friends are still in the forest.
M	BILL	We need their weight.
M	BILL	Dumbshits.
M	BILL	Come on!
M	OLDER COP	Starla!!
M	BILL	Shelby?
M	BILL	Shelby, you there?
M	SHELBY (O.S.)	Yo, Chief. How y'all doin'?
F	SHELBY	You dig that rat out of the hole?
M	BILL	Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
F	SHELBY	Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
M	BILL	Shelby --
F	SHELBY	Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
M	BILL	Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
M	BILL	Are you nodding?
F	SHELBY	Yeah.
M	BILL	I can't hear when you're nodding.
F	SHELBY	Sorry.
M	BILL	We'll be there in ten minutes.
F	KYLIE	The worms are in their brains. Drivin' 'em around...
F	STARLA	She's right. We saw one -- one came out of Wally's head.
M	TREVOR	Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came out there --
F	STARLA	Kylie, how do you --
F	STARLA	Kylie, how do you know that?
M	BILL	Kylie, honey. Please.
M	BILL (CONT'D)	A lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know. But we need your help to find out what's going on.
F	KYLIE	I was in the bath. It tried to go inside me and I -- for a minute I became it.
M	BILL	The worm?
F	KYLIE	I got it out.
M	TREVOR	What are they?
F	KYLIE	Part of him.
M	BILL	Who? Who?
F	KYLIE	Mrs. Grant's husband.
F	KYLIE	But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
F	STARLA	What other stuff?
M	TREVOR	He's a fucking Martian?!
M	BILL	A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
F	KYLIE	For real it looks like a needle. Its real face. But it always gots another. He goes from place to place, worlds... planets... killing 'em. He takes over half of what's alive and eats the other half. Till they're gone.
F	KYLIE	Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
F	STARLA	Through a wound on his stomach?
F	KYLIE	He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before - amoeba-things, and rhino-things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
F	STARLA	And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
F	KYLIE	When one sees you they all see you.
F	STARLA	An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
M	BILL	So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
M	BILL	Shit.
M	BILL	Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up. I got to leave my post.
M	BILL	Do it.
M	BILL	Hey, Starla.
M	BILL	Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
F	STARLA	I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
F	STARLA	Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
M	BILL	Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
F	STARLA	My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart-mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse.
M	BILL	When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
F	STARLA	That wasn't a good night, no.
M	BILL	I'm sorry.
F	STARLA	Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I fill his tank with like an eighth- a-gallon as usual. And he notices my lip's all swollen up, and starts asking me how it happened. I don't know why I chose then, why Grant -- I guess I saw an opportunity. And I told him everything, first time I told anyone. Grant was furious. He picked up a tire iron, walked straightaway into the garage, and beat my father half to death. You say it's not about love, Bill. But that was the closest thing to it I ever knew.
F	STARLA	Grant asked me to marry him a few weeks later. I felt... safe with him.
F	STARLA	After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
M	BILL	Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
M	TREVOR	Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon, we'll be in town, everything'll be fine.
F	STARLA	What's that?
M	TREVOR	They musta hit a deer. Probably got out to see if it's okay.
M	BILL	Fuck me.
M	TREVOR	Bambi-rats!
F	STARLA	Get in!
M	BILL	Shelby!
M	TREVOR	When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
M	BILL	Shelby!
M	SHELBY (O.S.)	Hey there, Chief.
M	BILL	Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away! Don't worry, Chief.
F	SHELBY	Already on our way.
M	DISEASED TOWNSFOLK	Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!
M	BILL	Come on.
M	TREVOR	What the hell are we going to do?!
M	BILL	Just block the doors, any way you can.
M	TREVOR	Goddamn snakes!!
F	STARLA	This is stupid.
M	BILL	What are you doing?!
F	STARLA	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
M	BILL	What?
F	STARLA	He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
M	BILL	No, Starla! No!
M	BILL	Nooo!
M	DISEASED WOMAN DISEASED KID	Starlaaaaaaa! Starlaaaa!
M	SMASHED-FACE MAN	You said for better or worse! You lied!
M	NO LONGER PRETTY BRENDA'S HUSBAND	I gave you everything! I. Loved. You!
M	SHELBY FAT SICK GUY	It's not just about lesson I wanted you by my side, plans! Hank Wilcox wants sugarplum. But I'm too
M	MR. INAPPROPRIATE WAITRESS	Your daddy'd still be You always thought I was a fucking your every hole joke, ain't you? weren't it for me!!
M	BRENDA'S HUSBAND	You like Pardy better'n me? That's who you want to screw now?!
F	STARLA	Grant... Please...
F	STARLA	I'm sorry... I know I haven't behaved how you -- how you want. I know. Don't... hurt... me.
F	STARLA	We need... to... talk.
M	DISEASED MAN BRENDA'S HUSBAND	Then talk. Then talk.
F	STARLA	Not here, though, okay? Not all of you. I'm not used to -- I want to talk to your face, Grant. Your more real face. Your --
M	SMASHED-FACE MAN	Pardy?!! Where are you, Pardy!!
M	DISEASED WOMAN SHELBY	Pardy. Pardy. Pardy. Come on out, Pardy.
M	PASTOR	We've surrounded the town, you prick! Ain't no way outta here!
F	STARLA	Grant?
F	STARLA	Grant? We should talk.
F	STARLA	Grant?
F	STARLA	Hey, Grant.
F	STARLA	You did some real interesting decorating here.
F	STARLA	Hey.
F	STARLA	Look, the sun's starting to come up.
F	STARLA	Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know you wanted it dark.
F	STARLA	You like these memories, huh, Grant?
F	STARLA	You like being called Grant, don't you?
F	STARLA	I think you do. You really do. You like being Grant. Like when we danced. And when you... made love to me here on the bed. Remember that?
F	STARLA	I know you've been alone, Grant. Almost forever. From here to there to there to here, there's never been another one for you.
F	STARLA	Grant. Grant, I could help you. Be with you the way you want. See, I want to live. I've never had much use for this world, not really. You and I, together, we --
F	STARLA	You don't trust me, I know. That's why I brought you someone, Grant.
F	STARLA	It's Bill. He's in the house next door. Just look.
F	STARLA	See? I brought him here for you! As an offering! To prove I love you more than him!
F	STARLA	Now, Bill!! Kill the motherfucker!!
F	GRANT	Er...?
F	STARLA	Hey.
M	BILL	Hey.
M	BILL	Starla, over here.
F	STARLA	We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
M	BILL	Yeah. Good.
M	CASHIER	Comes to 32.87.
M	BILL	There you go.
F	STARLA	Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to get aspirin.
M	BILL	I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
F	STARLA	Aspirin.
M	BILL	We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
F	STARLA	Okay.
M	BILL	Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
F	STARLA	You took Bill.
M	BILL	It's my nature.
F	STARLA	And this is mine.
