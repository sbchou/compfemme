M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NICK	Damn. Hello?
M	NICK	Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.
M	JENNA (V.O.)	It's five-thirty in the morning, Nick.
M	NICK	Yeah, sorry. This is like the only time I have to make any personal calls. I just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because I had a great time with you on our last date. Our last date was two weeks ago. You haven't called me since.
M	NICK	I know and that's my bad. I've been swamped at work --
M	JENNA (V.O.)	Yeah, I remember. Work was all you talked about when we went out.
M	NICK	Right. Well, I'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time -- 9 CONTINUED: 9 Listen, I'm actually seeing someone. And even if I weren't, the last thing I need is some career-obsessed guy complaining about work all the time. See you around, Nick.
M	NICK	Fuck!
M	HARKEN (O.S.)	Nick.
M	NICK	Yes?
F	HARKEN	See you in my office?
F	HARKEN	Here's my concern, Nick. You're a punctual guy. You understand the importance of getting to work on time. So that leaves me to wonder if there isn't something wrong with the internal clock in our security system. What do you think?
M	NICK	I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might have been a minute late.
F	HARKEN	Two minutes according to this. So either you're a liar -- which I know you're not -- or our system is off by a full minute. And if that's the case, I have no choice but to dismiss Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.
M	NICK	Okay, I might have been two minutes late.
F	HARKEN	So you did lie.
M	NICK	No, I --
M	NICK	Who are you calling?
F	HARKEN	Thomas. I'm letting him go. 13 CONTINUED: 13
M	NICK	Wait! Okay, I guess I lied. But I didn't mean to --
F	HARKEN	Trust is everything in this office, my friend. I know you've been working your tail off for that promotion, but if I can't trust you, how can I make you Senior VP of Sales?
M	NICK	I understand. You can trust me.
F	HARKEN	Now you sound like my wife.
F	HARKEN	`Trust me, honey.' `Trust me.' Meanwhile, she's making love to every guy in the neighborhood.
M	NICK	Oh, I'm sure she's... loyal to YOU --
F	HARKEN	How could you possibly know that?
M	NICK	I don't.
F	HARKEN	Are you making love to my wife, Nick?
M	NICK	What?! No! 15 CONTINUED: 15
F	HARKEN	I'm just kidding around. She's out of your league. No offense.
M	NICK	None taken.
F	HARKEN	Hmm.
F	HARKEN	Would you like one?
M	NICK	It's 8:15.
F	HARKEN	You think there's something wrong with a man enjoying a drink in the morning?
M	NICK	No, no. It's fine. I'd love a drink.
M	NICK	Thank you.
F	HARKEN	My pleasure.
M	NICK	Aren't you having one?
F	HARKEN	It's 8:15, Nick. I'm not an alcoholic.
M	NICK	Oh. Well, I only took it because I thought you were having one.
F	HARKEN	You took a drink because you thought I was going to have one? That doesn't exactly sound like something a Senior VP would do.
M	NICK	Well, I --
F	HARKEN	What if you thought I was going to dip my balls in honey and shaved coconut? Would you do that too?
M	NICK	Of course not.
F	HARKEN	Of course not. Anyway, we've moved up the date of the AGM so you're gonna need to complete your due diligence by Monday. You'll probably need to be here all weekend.
M	NICK	Okay.
F	HARKEN	Hey, you want a promotion, you've gotta earn it. Life's a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples.
M	NICK	Got it.
F	HARKEN	Nick.
F	HARKEN	That's 18-year-old Scotch. I can't really pour it back into the bottle.
F	HARKEN	That should carry you till lunch, huh?
F	STACY	Boy, I have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on. I keep swerving to the left.
M	DALE	Aww. You really like it?
F	STACY	I love it. I feel like a queen.
M	DALE	Well, you're my queen. I love you, Stacy.
F	STACY	Have a great day at work.
M	INTO --	
F	JULIA	All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going to give you the nitrous now and your root canal will be over before you know it. Dale? Please.
F	JULIA	How are you today, Dale?
M	DALE	I'm fine. Thanks.
F	JULIA	You get a haircut?
M	DALE	Uh-huh.
F	JULIA	Looks good.
M	DALE	Thank you.
F	JULIA	You ever watch that show, `Gossip Girl'?
M	DALE	Uh, no.
F	JULIA	I watched it last night. I'll tell you, lot of cuties on that program. Number 7 scraper, please. 22 CONTINUED: 22
F	JULIA	Thank you. I fingered myself so hard to Penn Badgely, I broke a nail.
F	JULIA	I'd let that kid put it in my ass. Bet he's packing a plus-size sausage under those True Religions. Probe.
M	DALE	What?
F	JULIA	I need the probe.
M	DALE	Oh, right.
F	JULIA	Bet you're no shrimp in the cock department either, huh, Dale?
M	DALE	Julia, please.
F	JULIA	Oh, come on. You know I like to fool around.
F	JULIA	Mr. Anderton! Bad!
F	JULIA	Okay, enough fun. Let's get back to work. Water, please.
M	DALE	Hey!
F	JULIA	Sorry, I'm a squirter. I think I can just make out our friend. Looks like someone is circumcised!
M	DALE	All right, Julia, listen. You can't keep doing this.
F	JULIA	I know, I know, you have a GIRLFRIEND --
M	DALE	She's not my girlfriend anymore. Stacy and I got engaged last night.
F	JULIA	What?
M	DALE	We're engaged.
F	JULIA	You're actually going to marry that little dummy?
M	DALE	Hey!
F	JULIA	I thought you said she was just a hole for your dick.
M	DALE	That's a horrible thing to say. I never said that!
F	JULIA	I'm very disappointed in you, Dale. Scaler.
M	UPS GIRL	Excuse me? Can you sign for this, please?
M	KURT	Sure. Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What is this?
M	UPS GIRL	I'm sorry?
M	KURT	This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it?
M	UPS GIRL	What do you mean?
M	KURT	Come on. You're way too good- looking to be a UPS girl. What are you, a model? An actress? What's gonna happen when I open this box? Is something going to jump out at me? 24 CONTINUED: 24
M	UPS GIRL	Nothing's gonna happen. I'm just a UPS girl.
M	KURT	Shut up.
M	UPS GIRL	You shut up. It's true.
M	KURT	Well, then, I need to take you out to dinner.
M	UPS GIRL	Why?
M	KURT	Because I want to be able to tell my friends that I took out the hottest UPS girl in America. Come on, what do you say?
M	KURT	Awesome. I'm Kurt.
M	UPS GIRL	Myrna.
M	KURT	Pretty name. How's Tuesday? Macaroni Grill?
M	UPS GIRL	Okay.
M	KURT	See you then, Myrna. Busy week? 24 CONTINUED: (2) 24
M	KURT	Hey, Jack. Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America.
M	JACK	You're what we used to call a rapscallion.
M	KURT	That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict.'
M	JACK	Walk with me, Kurt.
M	JACK	I wanted to talk to you about --
M	KURT	Last quarter's profits? I ran the numbers. We're down by 11 percent year-to-year.
M	JACK	It's this damn recession. What about cost-cutting measures?
M	KURT	Well, I know you don't want to cut STAFF --
M	JACK	No way. These people have worked their asses off for me. There's no reason they should suffer.
M	KURT	There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal. We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer.
M	JACK	You know why it's good? Because they'll dump our chemicals in rivers, pollute water supplies and hurt people. I've spent my life building this company. Would you want the Pellit name to be associated with something like that?
M	KURT	No, I wouldn't.
M	JACK	Everything okay, Margie?
F	MARGIE	Oh hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt. I've just been waiting to get in there for a while now...
M	JACK	Who's in there?
F	MARGIE	It's... your son.
M	JACK	Of course it is. Bobby? There's someone waiting. You almost done in there?
M	PELLIT	What the fuck?! A guy can't get any privacy in this place!
M	JACK	It's all yours, Margie.
M	JACK	You know, Bobby, you seem to be spending more time in that bathroom than at your desk these days.
M	PELLIT	Well, then, you're fucking stupid, Dad. Because that's clearly not true.
M	JACK	All I ask is that you do your part around here, son.
M	PELLIT	I do my part. I do other people's parts. But you just like to ride my ass because I'm your son. I don't see you screaming at -- -- dickskin here.
M	JACK	That's because Kurt does his work and does it well. You could take a lesson from him.
M	PELLIT	The only thing I'd take a lesson from him on is being gay. And I wouldn't take that lesson because I don't want to be gay.
M	JACK	Come on, Kurt.
M	PELLIT	Yeah, that's what I thought.
M	JACK	Tell me something, Kurt. Are you happy here?
M	KURT	You kidding? It's the best job in the world. 25 CONTINUED: 25
M	JACK	I'm glad to hear you say that. I'm rewriting my will tonight and there's going to be a special place for you in there.
M	KURT	He died instantly. They say his heart burst in his chest like a water balloon.
M	DALE	Wow. Sorry, man. He was like a dad to you.
M	KURT	I loved him. And I loved working for him. And now his idiot son is gonna be in charge. You know how many times I've caught him doing blow at work?
M	NICK	That sucks. You were the only one of us who didn't totally hate his job. Did I tell you Harken tricked me into having a drink at eight o'clock this morning? The guy's the devil.
M	DALE	I thought he was giving you a promotion. He is. And he's got to do it before the General Meeting next week.
M	DALE	Well, at least your boss doesn't sexually harass you.
M	KURT	This again?
M	DALE	I'm telling you, she's out of control. It's a full-on hostile work environment.
M	KURT	She's a woman who wants to have sex with you. How bad can it be?
M	DALE	Today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener.
M	KURT	Why don't you just fuck her?
M	DALE	I'm engaged!
M	KURT	Oh yeah. Congratulations, by the way.
M	DALE	Thank you.
M	NICK	There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there.
M	DALE	I can't apply for another job, remember?
M	KURT	Oh, right. Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester. 26 CONTINUED: (2) 26
M	NICK	He's not a child molester. He just took his dick out in a playground.
M	DALE	It was nighttime and I was peeing! And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that!
M	KURT	It worked out. Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself.
M	DALE	Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway? That's entrapment.
M	KURT	Well, I should go see if that girl wants to bone.
M	NICK	I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying.
M	KURT	This is how I grieve, okay?
M	DALE	Man. He must be grieving all the time.
M	NICK	He did say ten o'clock, right? 27 CONTINUED: 27 Yeah. Do you know what this is about?
M	NICK	It just said `staff meeting' on the memo. Funny how he gets all over me if I'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen.
M	HARKEN (O.S.)	You were two minutes late, Nick.
F	HARKEN	And I didn't know I had to punch a clock with you.
M	NICK	You don't. Of course you don't. I'm sorry --
F	HARKEN	I'm going to attribute this to your drinking problem.
M	NICK	I don't have a --
F	HARKEN	Let's get started. Shall we?
F	HARKEN	Okay, have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets? 28 CONTINUED: 28
F	HARKEN	Yes?
M	NICK	I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables.
F	HARKEN	And?
M	NICK	And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield.
F	HARKEN	Thank you, Nick. Did everyone see how he did that? Yes, he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem, but when the chips are down, Nick has what it takes.
F	HARKEN	Which brings us to our next order of business. I've decided who I want as our new Senior VP of Sales. He's sitting right here among you.
F	HARKEN	It's me.
M	NICK	What? 28 CONTINUED: (2) 28
F	HARKEN	I've decided to absorb the responsibilities of the Senior VP position into my own. I realized if you want something done right, you do it yourself. So, I'm going to be knocking down the wall between my office and what would've been the Senior VP's to create a single, enormous office. However, as a cost-cutting measure, I will only be taking 85% of the additional salary I'm entitled to. It's called self- sacrifice, people. Learn from this.
M	NICK	Mr. Harken, can I speak to you?
F	HARKEN	What is it?
M	NICK	You've been hinting for months that I was in line for that promotion.
F	HARKEN	And look how hard you've worked.
M	NICK	So you've just been lying to me?
F	HARKEN	Not lying. Motivating. We're all on the same team here, Nick. We're all trying to find Lorenzo's oil before it's too late for little Lorenzo. Besides, I'm the one who's taking on a lot more work. 29 CONTINUED: 29
M	NICK	Last month you kept me working so late I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam!
F	HARKEN	What?
M	NICK	My grandmother. I told you I needed to see her but you said I'd be fired if I left early. She died before I could get to the hospital. She taught me how to swim --
F	HARKEN	Oh, my God. I had no idea... that you called your grandmother Gam Gam. I don't mean to laugh, but that's adorable. Look, Nick, I'm sorry you didn't get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam. I make you work late because you're an invaluable part of this operation. And I need you in your current position.
M	NICK	I've been in that position for eight years now. Why would I stay here after being treated like this?!
F	HARKEN	Because I will see to it that no one else in our industry will hire you.
M	NICK	What?
F	HARKEN	Anyone who interviews you will want my letter of recommendation. And I'm prepared to tell them that you are a dishonest, insubordinate drunk. 29 CONTINUED: (2) 29
M	NICK	But that's not true! You can't do this!
F	HARKEN	Let me make this clear, you weak, little fuck. I own you. You're my bitch. Don't make the mistake of thinking you have free will. Because I can crush you any time I like. Settle in, friend. You're here for the long haul.
M	PELLIT (O.S.)	Yo, dickwall! What the fuck?
M	KURT	What?
M	PELLIT	You're three hours late. What's the deal?
M	KURT	I was at your father's funeral.
M	PELLIT	Maybe that excuse would've flown when my dad was here, but I'm in charge now.
M	KURT	That excuse wouldn't have made any sense when your dad was here.
M	PELLIT	In my office. Now.
M	PELLIT	Sit.
M	PELLIT	I've been looking over the books. You're the accountant. Tell me why this company is in the crapper.
M	KURT	It's not in the crapper. It's a recession. But we're still profitable.
M	PELLIT	Bullshit. Look, I know you and my dad were pals. Frankly, I always thought it was weird and gay and I never understood why my dad thought you were so great. But it doesn't matter now because he's in the ground and I'm your boss. And there's gonna be some changes around here. First of all... What is this `EnviroTech Waste Management' shit that we're paying so much for?
M	KURT	Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly.
M	PELLIT	Yeah, fuck that. We've got an offer from Bolivia to dump the stuff for a third the cost.
M	KURT	But that would endanger thousands of local residents. 31 CONTINUED: 31
M	PELLIT	So some jungle tribesmen get cancer. Boo friggin' hoo.
M	KURT	They're not tribesmen. It's a MODERN -- Look, Bobby, your dad told me very clearly he'd die before he'd save money by hurting people.
M	PELLIT	Well then, we're right on schedule, aren't we?
M	PELLIT	Oh, and we also need to trim the fat around here.
M	KURT	What do you mean?
M	PELLIT	I want you to fire the fat people. They're slow and lazy and they make me sad to look at. Start with Large Marge.
M	KURT	Margie's not fat. She's pregnant. I'm not firing her.
M	PELLIT	Fine. Then fire Professor Xavier over there. 32 CONTINUED: 32
M	KURT	Hank?
M	PELLIT	He creeps me out. Rolling around in that weird little chair of his.
M	KURT	I'm not firing anyone! It's like you don't care about this company at all.
M	PELLIT	No shit. You think when I was a kid I dreamed of running a fucking chemical company? No. I dreamed of retiring. Of being fed tropical fruit on a beach by a model while she blows me. And as soon as I squeeze all the profit out of this place, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. So here's the deal. You either fire the fatty or the cripple, or I fire both of them.
M	PELLIT	Everyone, can I have your attention please? I've just learned that Kurt has fired our dear friend Hank here. I want you to know that I am as surprised and angry about this as you are.
M	KURT	What are you -- ?!
M	PELLIT	This is entirely an accounting department decision. My hands are tied. You are one heartless bastard, Gamble. 33 CONTINUED: 33
M	KURT	Look, Hank, this was not my --
M	HANK	Fuck you, Kurt.
M	JULIA (O.S.)	Come in.
M	DALE	You wanted to see --
M	DALE	Oh, God.
F	JULIA	Have a seat, Dale.
M	DALE	Do I have to?
F	JULIA	Please.
M	DALE	Look, Julia, this is ridiculous --
F	JULIA	I know what you're going to say and that's exactly what I want to talk to you about. 35 CONTINUED: 35 Yes, I like to joke around at work. And sometimes I might cross the line a bit. But the last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable. That's unprofessional and I pride myself on being a professional.
F	JULIA	So from now on, I want you to tell me when and if I cross the line.
M	DALE	Now. Right now.
F	JULIA	What?
M	DALE	You're naked, Julia!
F	JULIA	I'm not naked. You can't even see my pussy.
M	DALE	Okay, right there! Just saying `pussy' to me. That's over the line.
F	JULIA	That's over the line? You're starting to sound like a little faggot, Dale.
M	DALE	Again! Naked, `pussy,' `faggot.' All over the line. And probably ILLEGAL --
F	JULIA	Okay, let's not start talking about illegal, Mr. Pees-on-Young- Boys.
M	DALE	It was an empty playground! In the middle of the night!
F	JULIA	Even worse. That little boy must have been terrified. 35 CONTINUED: (2) 35
F	JULIA	Let's cut to the chase. You're engaged now. And I respect the institution of marriage too much to violate it. That's why you need to fuck me well before the wedding. Because the closer it gets, the less ladylike I'm going to feel about this whole thing.
M	DALE	I'm not going to sleep with you, Julia.
F	JULIA	We'll see about that. OUT! GET OUT!
M	NICK	I feel like a total sucker. Harken was never planning on promoting me.
M	KURT	That coked-out douchebag is gonna destroy Pellit Chemicals.
M	DALE	She stood there with her breasts right in my face.
M	KURT	You know, yours just doesn't sound that bad.
M	DALE	Why don't you guys quit? It's not like you're sex offenders. 36 CONTINUED: 36
M	NICK	It's true. I mean, I'm young. I could go back to school, change fields.
M	KURT	Yeah. Why should I care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't? There's a million jobs out there. The world is your oyster.
M	GUY	Well, well, if it isn't the Three Musketeers, Nick, Kurt and Dale. Still hanging out like high school, huh?
M	NICK	I don't believe it. Kenny Orkin!
M	DALE	I heard you moved to New York to work at Lehman Brothers or something.
M	KENNY (GUY)	I did. Hired me right out of Yale.
M	KURT	So what are you doing back here?
M	KENNY	Don't you read the papers? They shut us down. I've been looking for work for the last two years. It's crazy out here. I can't even get a job waiting tables.
M	NICK	You? Waiting tables? You were voted Most Likely to Succeed. Everyone thought you were set.
M	KENNY	Everyone including me. I'd murder those Lehman Brothers if I could. Line them up, put one bullet through their three heads.
M	DALE	Easy, Kenny.
M	KENNY	It's just not fair. I was making high six-figures. Now I can't even afford this drink. Seriously, you think you guys can help me out at all?
M	DALE	Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks, Kenny.
M	KENNY	Okay, y'know that's not really gonna do it for me. I'll tell you what? What if I give you guys handjobs? Forty bucks. We can do it in the bathroom right here. I'll do the three of you for a hundred.
M	KURT	You're gay now?
M	KENNY	No, I'm not gay.
M	KENNY	I'm the opposite of gay!
M	KENNY	Come on. Handjobs for the Three Musketeers. Let's do this!
M	BARTENDER	I thought I told you to stay out of here! 36 CONTINUED: (3) 36
M	KENNY	Whoops. Gotta go, guys. Call me if you change your minds. I'm at my mom's.
M	KURT	So I guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives.
M	DALE	What do you mean?
M	KURT	What options do we have? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny. Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.
M	NICK	You do that too?
M	KURT	Of course. Everyone does. It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit.
M	NICK	The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes.
M	DALE	Jeez.
M	KURT	That's so funny. I had the same idea for Pellit. 37 CONTINUED: 37 Only using gasoline instead of water. And his ass instead of his mouth.
M	DALE	You guys are sick.
M	KURT	What's sick about it? It's just a way to let off steam.
M	NICK	Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses.
M	KURT	You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead.
M	NICK	Well, of course. It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy.
M	DALE	Me too.
M	KURT	Let's just consider this, for one second.
M	DALE	Consider what?
M	KURT	Killing our bosses. I'm just being hypothetical here.
M	DALE	Yeah, right.
M	NICK	Very funny.
M	KURT	Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever. These pieces of shit are going to die someday. We'd just be accelerating that natural process.
M	NICK	Shut up, Kurt.
M	DALE	Yeah, shut up, Kurt.
M	KURT	Frankly, I don't see any reason not to do it.
M	DALE	Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral --
M	KURT	It may be illegal but I'm not sure it's immoral. Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community. If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer. It would actually be immoral not to kill him.
M	NICK	I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken.
M	KURT	Exactly! Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone.
M	DALE	I can't believe you guys are actually talking about this. I don't care how bad our bosses are. We're not murderers.
M	NICK	No, we're not, Dale. We're just trying to live our lives. But someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives? Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever? 37 CONTINUED: (3) 37
M	KURT	No, we do not!
M	DALE	What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it.
M	NICK	Julia's ruining your life. That's wrong.
M	KURT	Yeah!
M	DALE	She's not ruining my life. If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit.
M	KURT	If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much?
M	DALE	I don't want to do it. And when you sober up neither will you. We're not killing anyone.
M	KURT	I was just being hypothetical.
M	NICK	Yeah, me too. Guess who?
M	DALE	I'm really not in the mood for this now --
M	DALE	Stacy?!
F	STACY	Not in the mood for what?
M	DALE	For... nothing. What are you doing here?
F	JULIA	I invited her.
F	STACY	She called and said now that we're engaged, she wanted to offer me free dental work. And you know I've had that loose filling for a while. It's so sweet of you, Julia.
F	JULIA	It's my pleasure. You're part of the family now.
M	DALE	Uhhhh... I don't know if this is a good idea.
F	STACY	Why not?
M	DALE	We don't want to take advantage of Julia.
F	JULIA	Dale, there's nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me. Nothing. Now what do you say we pump you full of gas? 38 CONTINUED: (2) 38 Wait -- no gas. She doesn't need to be out.
F	STACY	What are you talking about, Dale? You know I'm not good with drills.
F	JULIA	You don't want your fiancée to suffer, do you?
F	STACY	Ten, nine... eight... seh...
M	DALE	Hey! Stop it, what are you -- ?
F	JULIA	You're gonna give me that dong, Dale!
M	DALE	NO!
M	DALE	I knew you only brought her in here to mess with me.
F	JULIA	Let's have sex on top of her. Let's use her like a bed! 39 CONTINUED: 39
M	DALE	All right, that's it, Julia. This is over. You're out of your mind. I quit!
F	JULIA	I'll tell her you fucked me!
M	DALE	What?
F	JULIA	If you don't fuck me, I'll tell her you fucked me.
M	DALE	Tell her whatever you want. She'd never believe you.
F	JULIA	She already knows you're a sex offender. And once she sees these, I think she'll believe me.
M	DALE	What is that?
F	JULIA	You remember your first week here when I replaced the crown on your second bicuspid?
M	DALE	... Yeah?
F	JULIA	I took a few snapshots of the procedure. For my files. You... you did all this while I was unconscious?
F	JULIA	Yup.
M	DALE	How did you make it look like I was awake?
F	JULIA	Taped your eyes open.
M	DALE	This is rape! You raped me!
F	JULIA	Don't get all dramatic. Your dick wasn't hard. But it will be next time. Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album.
F	JULIA	Now, let's repair this patient's filling, shall we?
M	DALE	Let's kill the bitch.
M	KURT	Huh?
M	NICK	What bitch?
M	DALE	My boss. Our bosses. They need to die.
M	NICK	We were drunk last night, man. And didn't you say killing was wrong?
M	DALE	That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fiancée's unconscious body.
M	KURT	Whoa!
M	DALE	I say we kill them all. Are you guys in or out?
M	KURT	I was in last night.
M	DALE	Yes! Nick?
M	KURT	Look at her. Look at Bubby.
M	NICK	Gam Gam. 42 CONTINUED: 42
M	KURT	Look at Gam Gam. Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson. Little does she know that she'll never get to say goodbye to him. And why? Because his shithead boss wouldn't let him leave. What would Gam Gam want you to do?
M	NICK	Probably not kill him.
M	KURT	This isn't about Gam Gam. This is about you. What do you want, Nick?
M	NICK	I want him to die.
M	KURT	Damn straight!
M	NICK	Okay, I'm in.
M	KURT	All right! Let's do this. How do we do this?
M	DALE	I was thinking about that on my way over. Stacy and I watch a lot of `Law & Order' and there's a ton of ways criminals mess up. Things we'd never think of. They leave behind clothing fibers, bullet casings, hair, skin cells --
M	KURT	Skin cells?! I can't even keep track of my keys!
M	DALE	Exactly. And that's why we need a professional.
M	NICK	What are you talking about, a hitman? 42 CONTINUED: (2) 42
M	KURT	You know, that's not bad. I mean, we don't clean our own apartments, right? We hire someone to clean them for us.
M	DALE	Maybe you do, moneybags.
M	NICK	But where are we supposed to find a hitman?
M	DALE	That's the only problem. I have no idea.
M	KURT	I do. Meet at my place tomorrow after work. And make sure you're not followed.
M	NICK	Why would anyone follow us?
M	KURT	I don't know. People get followed.
M	DALE	What people?
M	KURT	Just meet me at my place.
M	KURT	Come in. The guy should be here pretty soon.
M	NICK	Wait. You actually found someone?!
M	KURT	It was as easy as buying a used futon. 43 CONTINUED: 43
M	DALE	Craigslist?! You found a hitman on Craigslist.
M	KURT	Yup. But they don't post it as `hitman.' That would be stupid. They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work.' Check it out. This is our guy.
M	NICK	`Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work. Fast and discreet. No children or political figures.'
M	KURT	See? He's principled.
M	DALE	This is so dangerous. What if he's a narc?
M	NICK	Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and cancel.
M	KURT	It's too late. He's on his way.
M	DALE	What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us?
M	KURT	I don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him.
M	NICK	Guys! I think this is him!
M	NICK	Nice car.
M	KURT	Whoa. This guy's legit.
M	DALE	I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together.
M	NICK	All right, let's just be professional here. We don't want to seem all giddy.
M	KURT	How's my hair?
M	NICK	It doesn't matter!
M	MAN	Is one of you Kurt?
M	DALE	Oh my God, he's like James Bond!
M	KURT	Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come in.
M	MAN	Thank you. Are all three of you participating in this? 45 CONTINUED: 45
M	NICK	Yes, we are.
M	MAN	Very well. Now before we go any further, I need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room. I will find out if there are.
M	DALE	No, no! We definitely don't want to record this, sir.
M	MAN	Then let's get started.
M	KURT	Whoa, whoa. What's that for?
M	MAN	For the mess.
M	NICK	We don't want you to kill us!
M	DALE	Oh my God! I knew it!
M	MAN	Kill you? What are you talking about?
M	KURT	Your ad said you do wet work.
M	MAN	That's correct. I urinate on other men for money.
M	NICK/KURT	What?!
M	MAN	Why do you think my ad was in the `men seeking men' section? 45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
M	NICK	You were looking in `men seeking men'?!
M	KURT	Yeah! We're men seeking a man, aren't we?
M	NICK	You are such a moron.
M	MAN	So you're telling me I drove all the way to the Valley and no one wants to be pissed on?
M	DALE	Please don't kill us.
M	MAN	I don't kill people! Can I use your rest room? I've stored up rather a large amount of pee for this.
M	KURT	It's right through there.
M	KURT	Good thing I didn't call the guy who was offering to do `dirty work.'
M	KURT	All right, I'll take the blame for that one.
M	NICK	That's big of you.
M	KURT	I'm going to make it up to you. I figured out a much better way to find a contract killer.
M	DALE	What's that? Hello, Mr. Gamble, thank you for contacting On Star --
M	DALE	Oh, come on!
M	NICK	This is your plan?
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	-- my name is Gregory. How can I be of service this evening?
M	KURT	Gregory, I need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles.
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	I'm sorry?
M	KURT	We need to find the bar with the most scumbags, lowlifes and hardcore shitheads. Can you help us out?
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	I'm afraid our listings are not organized by danger, sir. I do see there is a Bennigan's three blocks from your current LOCATION --
M	KURT	Okay, Gregory? That's unhelpful. While I'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there, they're not the kind of shitheads we need.
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	I can direct you to the neighborhood with the greatest number of car-jackings in your area. 46 CONTINUED: (2) 46
M	KURT	Now we're talking.
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	Very good, sir. You may wish to lock your doors.
M	NICK	So, do you like living in Bangalore?
M	GREGORY (ON STAR REP)(V.O.)	It's not bad. Humid.
M	DALE	Now, `Gregory.' Is that your real name?
M	GREGORY (V.O.)	No, sir. My real name is Atmanand.
M	KURT	Atmanand? How did you get Gregory from that?
M	GREGORY (V.O.)	`Gregory' was assigned to me by On Star.
M	NICK	Why don't they let you use your real name?
M	GREGORY (V.O.)	Many Americans find our real names off-putting.
M	KURT	Actually, I do find Atmanand a little off-putting. 48 CONTINUED: 48 You have arrived at your destination, sir.
M	DALE/NICK	Thank you, Gregory./Thanks, Gregory.
M	KURT	
M	DALE	Aren't you worried about your car?
M	KURT	Nah, Gregory's watching it.
M	NICK	You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there?
M	KURT	I think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there. Trust me, these are the lowest of the low.
M	NICK	Oh, real nice, Kurt. Way to be racist.
M	KURT	This isn't a race thing. We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live. I'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here. That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them. 50 CONTINUED: 50
M	DALE	You said they were the lowest of the low.
M	KURT	I was speaking socio-economically.
M	NICK	So what do we do now? Yell out `anyone here kill people for money?'
M	KURT	Let me handle this.
M	BARTENDER	Yeah?
M	KURT	Hey. How you doing? Nice place. Listen, does anyone here kill people for money?
M	NICK	Kurt!
M	BARTENDER	The fuck did you just say?
M	KURT	Don't get me wrong. This isn't about race. Our society discriminates and disenfranchises YOU --
M	DALE	Oh my God.
M	BARTENDER	I'm a small business owner. Who are you calling disenfranchised?
M	KURT	I didn't mean you in particular.
M	BARTENDER	Right. You mean all black people. 50 CONTINUED: (2) 50
M	NICK	Maybe we should go?
M	BARTENDER	You could do that. Or I could take the aluminum baseball bat I'm holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth.
M	DALE	I vote we go.
M	KURT	Okay, we're going. I'm sorry if I offended you. It was never my --
M	BARTENDER	Oh shit, please shut up.
M	KURT	Okey doke.
M	DALE	This is ridiculous. We're never gonna find someone to do this for us.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES (O.S.)	Yo!
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	I think I can help you boys.
M	DALE	Oh, we're just gonna follow him into that alley?... All right. 52 CONTINUED: 52
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	I heard you're looking for someone to take care of some business for you?
M	NICK	Yes, we are. Are you a... businessman?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Cocksucker Jones.
M	NICK	Excuse me?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	That's my name.
M	DALE	Your first name is Cocksucker?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	And my last name's Jones. You got a problem with that?
M	DALE	No, no. It's just interesting. That's the name on your birth certificate?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Naw, man. It's a nickname. My real name is Dean.
M	DALE	Oh! Like Dean Jones. The actor from Herbie the Love Bug.
M	KURT	I don't think he knows who Dean Jones is.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	I know who Dean Jones is, bitch! I can't walk around here with that kind of faggy, cracker name.
M	NICK	So you chose `cocksucker'? 52 CONTINUED: (2) 52
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	That's right. Nobody fucks with a cocksucker. `Cocksucker' is the toughest name there is.
M	DALE	Not `motherfucker'?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	I considered Motherfucker. But in the end, I thought Cocksucker Jones sounded more badass than Motherfucker Jones.
M	KURT	I agree.
M	NICK	Okay, here's the thing: we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of. Is that something you might be able to help us with?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	It is. Assuming you've got the cheese.
M	KURT	We've got cheese. How much cheese are we talking?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	For three hits? That's gonna run you thirty large.
M	NICK	That's a lot of cheese.
M	KURT	We don't have that much cheese.
M	DALE	Isn't there any kind of discount because we're buying three at once? Like buy two, get one free.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	This ain't the motherfucking Cold Stone Creamery. It's thirty large or nothing.
M	NICK	There's no way we can pay that. 52 CONTINUED: (3) 52
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Five large.
M	DALE	Wow. Good negotiating.
M	NICK	That's a lot more reasonable. And that would be for all three, Cocksucker?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Yeah.
M	KURT	Great. We're in.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Okay, meet me back here tomorrow night with the cash. I'll take care of the rest.
M	NICK	Should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	No, just, whatever. Small bills.
M	NICK	Got it.
M	KURT	And do you want it in any particular container, like a shoebox?
M	NICK	Or a paper bag?
M	DALE	Or plastic. I read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Fuck the environment! Just put that shit in a briefcase.
M	NICK	Got it. Thanks. Come on, guys.
M	DALE	Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	What?!
M	DALE	I mean, assuming we don't get the case back... We're not getting the case back, right?
M	DALE	Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks. Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end.
M	NICK	We'll cover the briefcase, Dale.
M	DALE	Then let's get a cheap one. It doesn't have to be real leather. Are you cool with faux -- ? 53 CONTINUED: 53
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Looks like it's all here.
M	DALE	Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all. Could've just used a manila envelope.
M	KURT	Shut up, Dale.
M	NICK	So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've... taken care of business?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Here's the thing. I just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and I'm still on probation. They're watching me. So if I step out of line, I go right back inside.
M	KURT	You told us you could take care of it.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	And I'm gonna. I'm gonna be your professional advisor. Think of me as your murder consultant.
M	NICK	We don't want a murder consultant. We want a murderer.
M	DALE	I knew we were getting ripped off!
M	KURT	Okay, look. This isn't what we talked about. 54 CONTINUED: 54 Can we just get our money back, please? Then we'll be on our way.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Sorry, no refunds.
M	NICK	That's five thousand dollars. You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	I think you're forgetting who you're talking to.
M	DALE	Whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Now either I give you the advice you paid for, or you can walk away with nothing. Up to you.
M	KURT	Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Most killers are first-timers. Look, the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident. Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide, that sort of thing. If you do it right, you won't even have to be there when it goes down.
M	NICK	That makes sense. But how would we fake three accidents?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	You need to stalk your prey, track their movements, get to know them inside and out. Where do they go? What do they eat for breakfast? Who're they fucking?
M	DALE	You're talking about surveillance and recon.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	But making it look like an accident won't be enough if the pigs can pin a motive on you.
M	NICK	Well, we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	So why don't you kill each other's bosses?
M	DALE	Hey, that's a good idea. Like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.
M	KURT	The Danny DeVito movie?
M	DALE	Yes, the famous Alfred Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie. You're thinking of Throw Mama from the Train. But it's actually the same idea. If we kill each other's bosses there's no link to us.
M	NICK	That's pretty good. COCKSUCKER JONES That's what you're paying me for. Now ain't that worth five grand?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Yeah, well, too fucking bad.
M	KURT	We're outside. You ready for a little recon?
M	NICK	Yeah. I just need to get Harken to let me leave early.
M	KURT	What's the difference? He's not going to be your boss much longer.
M	NICK	If I get fired before we kill Harken, this'll all have been for nothing. I'll just be an out-of- work murderer. I'll be down in three minutes.
F	HARKEN	What in God's name...?!
M	NICK	Sorry, sir. I've been fighting this bug all day. I'll just get back to work --
F	HARKEN	No. Go home. I don't want you getting everyone else sick.
M	NICK	Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Harken. 56 CONTINUED: 56
F	HARKEN	Wait. Take your work with you. Have it on my desk at six AM.
F	HARKEN	Disgusting.
M	KURT	Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit makes a move, we tail him. It is on now.
M	NICK	Oh, it's on.
M	DALE	Hells yeah!
M	KURT	Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much this sucks.
M	DALE	I don't get it. On TV, surveillance always looks so great. They've got their cups of coffee. Their sunflower seeds. They talk about their lives. And then, right when they reveal something really intimate, the perp appears and they spring into action.
M	NICK	Are we even sure he's home?
M	KURT	Let's go check it out.
M	NICK	I don't see him.
M	DALE	What are you doing?
M	KURT	We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn. We have to go in.
M	DALE	What about fingerprints? We don't have gloves.
M	KURT	Here, do this.
M	KURT	Here we go.
M	KURT	Dale, keep an eye out. Let us know if Pellit's coming.
M	DALE	Got it. Wait, I don't know what he looks like.
M	NICK	It doesn't matter. Just tell us if anyone comes.
M	DALE	Got it.
M	KURT	Wow. This guy's a bigger douchebag than me.
M	NICK	Okay, let's split up. Look for any intel we can use on him.
M	KURT	What kind of intel?
M	NICK	I don't know. I guess we'll know it when we see it.
M	DALE	Hey, Nick? Does this count as intel?
M	NICK	Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.
M	DALE	God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit! 61 CONTINUED: 61
M	NICK	What the fuck?!!
M	DALE	Sorry, my sleeves were slippery!
M	NICK	We've got to get that back in the box.
M	DALE	I've got it.
M	NICK	Look out. Let me try this.
M	DALE	I guess we should've emptied the Dustbuster before we used it.
M	NICK	You think?
M	DALE	Hey look, there's a piece of cereal in here. Can't tell if that's a corn flake or a frosted flake...
M	KURT	Okay, my work upstairs is done. You guys ready to split?
M	NICK	We need to be better prepared. That was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time.
M	KURT	Not a complete waste.
M	NICK	Oh no... don't tell me...
M	DALE	You stole that from Pellit's house?
M	KURT	It's got his calendar and his contacts. This is what recon's all about.
M	DALE	Nobody said we'd be stealing.
M	KURT	Shall we pay a little visit to your boss, Nick?
M	NICK	I guess so. But let's make a stop first. What did you need to get?
M	NICK	No more sleeve gloves.
M	DALE	Nice.
M	KURT	Oh man, you should've asked me. I've got a whole box of those in my bedside table. Don't judge me.
M	NICK	Take a right up here. Harken's place is about a mile away.
M	DALE	Y'know... this is kinda, I don't know... exciting.
M	KURT	Very.
M	NICK	Yeah. I guess we're really doing this now, huh?
M	DALE	I guess so.
M	DALE	Can I have a pair?
M	NICK	You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little... messy. What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken?
M	DALE	Okay -- again, I don't know what he looks like.
M	NICK	If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal.
M	DALE	Fine. I'll honk the horn six times.
M	KURT	Maybe something a little more subtle?
M	DALE	Honk the horn four times?
M	NICK	How about you just honk once?
M	DALE	People honk once all the time. You'll be running in and out of the house.
M	KURT	Fine. Honk twice.
M	DALE	Okay...
M	NICK	Looks like the coast is clear.
M	KURT	Damn. Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way.
M	NICK	Kurt, wait!
M	KURT	Holy shit. I broke the rock.
M	NICK	No, it's one of those hide-a-key things. Look... 74 CONTINUED: 74
M	NICK	Wow. This is not how I pictured his place.
M	KURT	For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits.
M	NICK	Jesus!
M	KURT	Stupid cat. Let's check upstairs.
M	DALE	`Do you believe in love after love/I can feel something inside me say/I really don't think you're strong enough now...' 77 CONTINUED: 77
M	KURT	God damn it! How many cats do they have?
M	NICK	I think that was the same one.
M	KURT	Little bastard.
M	KURT	Damn. That's Mrs. Harken? I'd like to cover her in cock yogurt.
M	NICK	You want to cover every woman in... did you say `cock yogurt'?
M	KURT	I did.
M	KURT	Ahhh!
M	NICK	If he's so scared of us, why doesn't he just leave us alone?!
M	DALE	C'mon, c'mon... yes! 79 CONTINUED: 79
F	HARKEN	Hey, schmuck.
M	DALE	Excuse me?
F	HARKEN	You want to tell me why you're littering on my street?
M	DALE	Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the window. I wasn't littering.
F	HARKEN	I don't care if it blew out of your twat. Now, get your fucking Chevy Cavalier the hell off my block!
M	DALE	Whoa. Sir, there's no need to be hostile.
F	HARKEN	Hostile? You want to see hostile? How about I go in the house and get my --
M	DALE	Get your what?
F	HARKEN	Peanuts?
M	DALE	Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut butter sandwich.
M	DALE	Oh god! What should I do?! Tell me what to do! 79 CONTINUED: (2) 79
M	DALE	What do I do with this? Should I inject you?!
M	DALE	Okay, hold on! I got this.
M	DALE	Did I do it? Did I get enough in?! I'm gonna do it again!
M	NICK	Do you see a Day Runner or an address book?
M	KURT	NO -- What the...? Dude, check this out.
M	NICK	That's Harken! Dale's killing Harken!
M	KURT	Holy shit! He's really doing it! Out where everyone can see him. 80 CONTINUED: 80
M	NICK	What the hell is he thinking?!
M	KURT	He's not stopping. He's gonna get us all caught. We've gotta get out of here.
M	NICK	What about Dale?
M	KURT	He's a psychopath. We leave him behind.
M	NICK	Right. Let's go through the back!
F	MRS. HARKEN	Oh my god! What happened?!
M	DALE	He had an allergic reaction. But I think he's coming around. Do you know him?
F	MRS. HARKEN	He's my husband.
F	MRS. HARKEN	Honey? Can you hear me?
F	HARKEN	Wha-- What did you do to me?
M	DALE	I injected you with your thing. 81 CONTINUED: 81
F	MRS. HARKEN	He saved your life, honey. Thank you so much!
M	DALE	Oh, it was nothing.
F	HARKEN	What's this? What's with the hugging?
F	MRS. HARKEN	I'm just thankful that he was here.
F	HARKEN	I'll bet you are. Do you know this guy?
F	MRS. HARKEN	No. We just --
F	HARKEN	Are you fucking him, Rhonda?
F	MRS. HARKEN	Oh, come on.
F	HARKEN	What were you doing out here, anyway? Waiting to fuck my wife?
M	DALE	I've never met your wife --
F	HARKEN	You need to get the hell out of here.
F	MRS. HARKEN	Dave, stop it. You should be thanking him. Why are you being so suspicious? 81 CONTINUED: (2) 81
F	HARKEN	Why? Because I know you sleep around on me. And I'm going to find out who it is.
F	MRS. HARKEN	You're being ridiculous.
F	HARKEN	Am I? What about Maurilio? I see the way you look at him.
F	MRS. HARKEN	I am not having sex with the gardener!
M	NICK	I can't believe that idiot Dale. You realize we're all going to jail because of him.
M	KURT	I can't go to jail. Look at these eyes. Look at this ass. They'll be all over me.
M	NICK	Yeah, me too.
M	KURT	Well...
M	NICK	What do you mean `well'? I'd get raped just as much as you.
M	KURT	No, of course you would. You're a good-looking guy.
M	NICK	You think you're more rape-able than I am. 82 CONTINUED: 82
M	KURT	I never said that --
M	DALE	Oh good. You guys are here. Did you see me out there?
M	KURT	Yeah, Dale, we saw you.
M	DALE	Pretty neat, huh?
M	NICK	No, it wasn't neat! You stabbed Harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood!
M	KURT	Not cool, man.
M	DALE	Wait, that was Harken?
M	NICK	Who'd you think you were stabbing?
M	DALE	I wasn't stabbing anybody. That was an epi-pen. He was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and I injected him.
M	NICK	So let me understand this. My boss, who we are trying to kill, was dying in front of you and you saved his life?
M	KURT	Not cool, man.
M	DALE	Wait, you were just mad at me for killing him and now you're mad at me for not killing him?! See, this is why I needed to know what these people look like! 82 CONTINUED: (2) 82
M	NICK	Hang on a sec. Maybe this recon wasn't a waste of time. Now we know Harken's deathly allergic to peanuts and Pellit has a huge stash of cocaine.
M	KURT	We could put peanuts in Harken's house and rat poison in Pellit's coke!
M	NICK	Everyone would assume that Pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs.
M	DALE	But Harken must always have that epi-pen on him.
M	KURT	I bet he doesn't wear it in the shower. We could put peanuts in his shampoo!
M	NICK	Perfect! Two fatal accidents. And we're not even there when they happen.
M	DALE	That just leaves Julia.
M	KURT	Tomorrow night, I'll surveil her and figure out how to take her down.
M	NICK	Good. I'll get some rat poison and take care of Pellit. Dale, think you can get some peanuts into Harken's shampoo?
M	DALE	I can do that.
M	KURT	All right. That just leaves us with one final thing to settle. 82 CONTINUED: (3) 82
M	NICK	What's that?
M	KURT	Dale, if Nick and I were in prison, which one of us would get raped more?
M	NICK	Hey. Have you learned anything about Julia yet?
M	KURT	Well, I've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot. How's it going over there?
M	NICK	I'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep. I wonder how Dale's doing with Harken.
M	NICK	Jesus, where does he get the energy? Oh yeah.
M	NICK	What's up, Dale? 90 CONTINUED: 90
M	DALE	Harken just left his house. I'm going in.
M	NICK	Good luck, man.
M	DALE	Thanks.
M	DALE	Ahhh!
M	NICK	Okay. Here we go.
M	DALE	Nick?
M	NICK	What?
M	DALE	I'm not sure if I can do this.
M	NICK	Where are you?
M	DALE	In Harken's bathroom. About to pour the nuts in his shampoo. But, I just... I know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know?
M	NICK	Yeah. I know.
M	DALE	What should I do? Should I do it?
M	NICK	What the fuck?!
M	DALE	What?
M	NICK	It's Harken. He's here!
M	DALE	At Pellit's?! Why?!
M	NICK	I don't know. He's knocking on his door!
M	DALE	How would Harken even know Pellit?
M	NICK	Oh my god oh my god oh my god...
M	DALE	What? What? What?!
M	NICK	He shot him. Harken shot Pellit!
M	DALE	Oh my god. Is he dead?!
M	NICK	Shhhh!
M	NICK	Fuck!
M	DALE	What's happening?
M	NICK	Harken's gone.
M	DALE	What about Pellit?
M	NICK	He's not moving. He looks dead.
M	DALE	Shit! What do we do?!
M	NICK	I've got to get out of here before someone sees me! Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.
M	KURT	Okay, let's all stay calm and figure this out.
M	NICK	Calm? How can we be calm? I watched a man die an hour ago!
M	KURT	A man you were going to kill anyway.
M	NICK	Well...
M	KURT	What?
M	NICK	I don't know if I had it in me.
M	DALE	Me neither. 99 CONTINUED: 99
M	KURT	I can't believe you guys! You can't just bail on a plan like that at the last minute.
M	NICK	You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia?
M	KURT	I don't know. I mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her.
M	DALE	`Afterwards'?
M	NICK	You slept with her, didn't you?
M	DALE	Oh god. Please tell me you didn't sleep with her.
M	NICK	You are a mess.
M	KURT	I know, I know. But it's not my fault.
M	KURT (V.O.)	At first I was surveilling her just like I was supposed to...
M	KURT (V.O.)	Then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window. With the lights on. She must've known I was there.
M	KURT (V.O.)	Then she made herself a little snack. A Popsicle...
M	KURT (V.O.)	... then a banana....
M	KURT (V.O.)	... and finally a hot dog. I mean, three penis-shaped foods cannot be coincidence. And in that weird order? That's not a proper meal.
M	DALE (V.O.)	So you took that as an invitation to fuck her?
M	KURT (V.O.)	No. I took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her. 103 CONTINUED: 103
M	NICK	There is something clinically wrong with you.
M	KURT	I know. I'm a rapscallion.
M	DALE	You're not a rapscallion. You're a whore. A filthy whore.
M	KURT	Hey. Not nice. And besides, I think I actually solved your problem, Dale. Julia just needed a good fucking. I bet she's not going to mess with you anymore.
M	NICK	Whatever. We have bigger fish to fry right now. What do we do about Harken?
M	KURT	Here's what we do. We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit. Boom. Harken's in jail. Pellit's in hell. Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her. Our problems are solved. Boom.
M	NICK	Okay, but we should find a payphone. We don't want them tracing the call to us.
M	NICK	Come on, we'll take my car.
M	NICK	What the hell?
M	COP	Are you the owner of this vehicle?
M	NICK	Uh, yes. Is there something wrong?
M	COP	We've got an APB on a black Kia Spectra, license 4HIG208.
M	NICK	Can I ask why?
M	COP	A traffic cam caught this vehicle fleeing the scene of a crime tonight. I'm going to need you to follow us to the station.
M	KURT	Officer? This is not my car. Is it okay if I just -- ?
M	COP	All three of you, please.
M	DALE	They know everything. We're dead. I can't believe I let you guys talk me into this! 107 CONTINUED: 107
M	KURT	Oh, please. We were just being hypothetical. You're the one who pushed us to do it.
M	NICK	We can't even say anything about Harken now.
M	KURT	Why not?
M	NICK	Uh, well, Kurt, being outside the murder victim's house because I was planning to murder him probably isn't the best alibi in the world.
M	KURT	You know, I didn't actually do anything illegal, so...
M	DALE	You broke into two people's houses and stole a BlackBerry!
M	KURT	You gonna rat on me, Dale?
M	DALE	Well, since I'm the only one without a connection to the murder, yeah, maybe I will.
M	NICK	That means you'd also rat on me.
M	KURT	Not if I rat on Dale first.
M	HAGAN	Gentlemen, this way, please.
M	HAGAN	Do you want to explain why you were driving 61 in a 25 zone, a block from the victim's house two minutes after he was shot to death?
M	NICK	I... was drag racing. I am a drag racer. There's no law against that, is there?
M	HAGAN	Actually there is.
M	SAMSON	You were drag racing in a Kia Spectra?
M	NICK	I don't win a lot.
M	HAGAN	Here's what I don't understand. You're at the crime scene. An hour later when we find your car, you just happen to be hanging out with this guy... ... a registered sex offender --
M	KURT	Tsk tsk.
M	HAGAN	... and this guy... ... whose employee ID says he works for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company. 110 CONTINUED: 110
M	KURT	Wait. My boss was murdered?! Bobby Pellit?!
M	DALE	You want me to get you a Kleenex?
M	KURT	I can't believe this. What were you doing near his house?!
M	NICK	Where were you during the murder?
M	KURT	I was making love.
M	DALE	`Making love.'
M	KURT	Let me ask you something, Detective. Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter. Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information?
M	HAGAN	No. But he would be entitled to some sort of jail time. Because if he knew who the shooter was and didn't tell us, that would be obstruction of justice.
M	KURT	Well, then I'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys? 110 CONTINUED: (2) 110
M	SAMSON	If you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence, we're going to be here for a long time.
M	DALE	Okay wait!
M	DALE	Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave. Does that mean we're under arrest?
M	HAGAN	No. We just brought you in for questioning.
M	DALE	So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us?
M	SAMSON	Not yet.
M	DALE	Well then, we're free to go?
M	HAGAN	Technically.
M	DALE	Come on, guys. 111 CONTINUED: 111
M	NICK	Nice work. Where'd that come from?
M	DALE	`Law & Order.'
M	KURT	We really showed those guys.
M	NICK	`We'? You were gonna turn us in!
M	KURT	For, like, a second.
M	SAMSON (O.S.)	Stop!
M	SAMSON	For speeding and running a red light. Don't get too comfortable out there, boys. Our forensics team is sweeping Pellit's house for fingerprints and DNA. And they don't miss much. 114 CONTINUED: 114
M	KURT	We are so fucked.
M	NICK	Maybe it's time to lawyer up.
M	DALE	I don't have money for a lawyer. I gave all my money to Cocksucker Jones!
M	KURT	Hey, that's right! I forgot all about Cocksucker. Why don't we ask him what to do?
M	NICK	We did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murder consultant.
M	DALE	Actually, it was five thousand forty with the briefcase.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Oh damn, look who's back. How did it go with the Strangers on a Train shit?
M	KURT	Not great. We need your help.
M	NICK	One of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Shut the fuck up! What kind of evil geniuses are you? 115 CONTINUED: 115
M	DALE	We don't even know why it happened. But the cops brought us in as suspects. What do we do now?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	First things first. I'm gonna need another five thousand dollars.
M	KURT	What? No way. You said the last five thousand would cover this!
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Okay, fine. Pay for my drink.
M	DALE	Not the best negotiator, is he?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Let me ask you this -- the guy who killed the other guy you were planning on killing, are the police after him too?
M	NICK	No. They don't suspect him.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	All right, so you're gonna need to encourage him to turn himself in, by say, kidnapping his wife and mailing him her earlobe or something.
M	DALE	That's horrible.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Naw, the earlobe's vestigial. All right, how about you trick him into confessing what he did while you wear a wire?
M	KURT	A wire. That's good. 115 CONTINUED: (2) 115
M	NICK	Is that how the cops caught you when you murdered someone?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	What the hell are you talking about? I never murdered anyone.
M	NICK	What?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Who told you I killed somebody?
M	KURT	You did. You said you served a `dime' for `some pretty ugly shit.'
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	It was ugly.
M	DALE	What was it?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	You ever see the movie Snow Falling on Cedars?
M	NICK/KURT	No. Yes.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	I got caught with a video camera making a bootleg copy of that movie.
M	NICK	You did ten years for video piracy?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Hey, that's a federal offense. They take that shit serious. I also made the mistake of representing myself at trial. May have insulted a few of the jurors. 115 CONTINUED: (3) 115
M	KURT	Hold on. You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie?!
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	So you do know it.
M	DALE	If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Gun?
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	This is a motherfucking iPhone.
M	NICK	I feel like such a moron.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Well, you are a moron. You don't walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because he's black.
M	KURT	Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
M	COCKSUCKER JONES	Trust me on the wire thing, though. Worked for Donnie Brasco. Bootlegged that movie too. 117 CONTINUED: 117
M	HAGAN	You got something for us?
M	CRIME TECH	We didn't find any foreign prints in the house, but we did get a DNA match for one of your suspects, Kurt Gamble.
M	SAMSON	Where was it?
M	CRIME TECH	Pellit's upstairs bathroom. His toothbrush. It had traces of Gamble's fecal matter.
M	HAGAN	That sick bastard.
M	CRIME TECH	That's not all. We found feces on Pellit's hairbrush, face soap, floss and razor.
M	SAMSON	Razor?!
M	CRIME TECH	The handle. Not the blade. This Gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass.
M	HAGAN	All I care about is that it puts him inside the house. That's enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing, sex offender friends. I'll call the DA. 119 CONTINUED: 119
M	KURT	Okay, looks quiet. Is the tape recorder ready?
M	DALE	Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated. One of us needs to tape it to our chest.
M	KURT	I'll do it. I'm the only one without hair on my chest.
M	NICK	That's `cause you shave it.
M	KURT	I don't shave it. I wax it.
M	DALE	So what do we do now? Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him?
M	NICK	I have a better idea. Let's be in the house when he walks in. He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess.
M	KURT	Right. We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp. That'll freak him out.
M	DALE	Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken.
M	NICK	I'll be in the chair. 119 CONTINUED: (2) 119
M	KURT	Why do you get to be the guy in the chair?
M	NICK	He's my boss.
M	DALE	We could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time.
M	KURT	That doesn't sound intimidating. That sounds like a musical number.
M	DALE	I guess you're right. I'll turn on the lamp.
M	KURT	So I'm just supposed to stand there like an idiot?
M	NICK	You're recording it all. You're the most important member of the team.
M	KURT	Don't patronize me, Nick.
M	PARTYGOERS	Surprise! 121 CONTINUED: 121
F	MRS. HARKEN	Who are you?
M	NICK	Uh... hi... sorry we're late. I'm Nick. I work with your husband AND -- Aren't you the young man who helped Dave on the street the other day?
M	DALE	Uh, yes. How's he doing?
F	MRS. HARKEN	He's fine. Thanks to you. Did I invite you to this?
M	GUEST #1	His car just turned the corner!
M	GUEST #2	Someone get the lights!
M	KURT	Hi, we didn't formally meet. I'm Kurt.
F	MRS. HARKEN	Hi.
M	KURT	Nick didn't tell me that his boss was married to a model.
F	MRS. HARKEN	I'm not a model.
M	KURT	When did you quit? 121 CONTINUED: (2) 121
M	PARTYGOERS	Surprise!
F	MRS. HARKEN	Were you surprised?
F	HARKEN	Oh, yeah.
F	MRS. HARKEN	Look, everyone's here.
F	HARKEN	Almost everyone.
F	MRS. HARKEN	Who are you talking about?
F	HARKEN	I think you know. I need to put my stuff away. I'll be right back.
M	NICK	He's going off alone. This is our chance.
M	DALE	You guys ready?
M	KURT	So fucking ready.
M	NICK	Okay, stay close. 122 CONTINUED: 122
M	KURT	Gotcha.
F	HARKEN	What the hell are you doing here? You come to stab me a few more times, you lunatic? And my wife invited you? Are you fucking her too?
M	NICK	We know what you did, Harken.
F	HARKEN	What does that mean?
M	NICK	We were there. We saw you kill him.
F	HARKEN	So what is this? A shakedown? You think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wife's lover?
M	DALE	Say his name.
F	HARKEN	What?
M	DALE	The guy you killed. What was his name?
F	HARKEN	Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't matter anymore.
M	NICK	There it is! Let's go, guys --
F	HARKEN	Yeah, I killed Pellit --
M	NICK	Hang on. Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend, KURT --
F	HARKEN	I walked right up to his door and I shot him in his fucking chest, and I'll tell you something: I liked it. So if you think I'm a pussy who won't do the same exact thing to some half-assed blackmailer, guess again.
M	NICK	You know who really thinks you're a pussy is my friend Kurt. Let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just --
F	HARKEN	You're pathetic, Waters. You come into my home, on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit? Well, guess what? You're a dead man. You... ... you, and your friend Kurt, whoever the fuck he is. Dead. Men.
M	DALE	We didn't know it was your birthday.
M	NICK	What are you doing? What's in that?
F	HARKEN	My gun. Just give me a second.
M	NICK	We had him! We had the whole thing. What happened to Kurt?
M	KURT	Oh, hey.
M	NICK	`Hey'?! Where were you?!
M	KURT	Uh, I had to go to the bathroom. Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to record Harken?
M	NICK	You're too late, Kurt! He confessed the whole damn thing!
M	DALE	More than once! Then he told us we were dead men! He's getting his gun right now!
M	KURT	Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked up. 124 CONTINUED: 124
M	NICK	Yeah, you --
M	NICK	You dick!
M	KURT	Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak, weak man. I admit it.
M	KURT (V.O.)	In here? But all those people are right outside.
M	MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)	I know. That makes it even hotter.
M	MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)	Your balls are so smooth. I wax them.
M	DALE	Is there anything you don't wax? 126 CONTINUED: 126
M	NICK	Ugh. Turn it off, Dale! Oh yeah... oh shit!
M	MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)	Whoops. That was fast...
M	KURT	Yeah, Dale, turn that off!
M	KURT (O.S.)	Holy shit! They must have found my DNA. Turn around! Get us out of here!
M	KURT	Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again. Probably ever.
M	DALE	What?!
M	KURT	I'm sure they have cops at all our places. I think our best bet is to get out of the country.
M	NICK	Where are we going to go?
M	KURT	Mexico?
M	DALE	Everyone flees to Mexico. That's the first place they'll look.
M	KURT	You're right. What about Asia? We could become kick boxers.
M	NICK	What the fuck are you talking about?
M	KURT	What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment? What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers?
M	NICK	What if I was destined to smack you right in the face?
M	KURT	That seems like a lesser destiny.
M	DALE	Hello?
M	INTERCUT WITH:	
F	JULIA	Hello, lover.
M	DALE	Oh God. Look, Julia, I can't talk right now --
F	JULIA	No worries, baby. I actually meant to call your home phone. You know, to tell Stacy about us.
M	DALE	No! Wait!
F	JULIA	I think I've waited long enough. I'm tired of you playing with my emotions.
M	DALE	I'm not playing. I'm going to do it. I swear!
F	JULIA	This Friday. At the office.
M	DALE	Fine!
F	JULIA	Wait. What are you going to do to me?
M	DALE	I'm going to... have sex with you.
F	JULIA	Details! And be explicit.
M	DALE	Right now? You want me to say it?
M	KURT	Oh, shit. We've got company. 133 CONTINUED: 133
M	NICK	It's Harken! Lose him!
M	KURT	Lose him? Sure, Nick. His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150.
F	JULIA	Say it!
M	DALE	I'm gonna put my penis in your pussy!
F	JULIA	Oh, come on, Casanova. You can do better than that.
M	DALE	I'm gonna make you feel good. With my tongue... and my fingers. And whatnot.
M	NICK	Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts!
F	JULIA	You going to slap me with your cock, Dale?
M	DALE	Yes! Yes! I'm going to beat your face with my cock!
F	JULIA	More!
M	DALE	I'm gonna put my balls in your hair! I'm gonna spit on your arms!
F	JULIA	See you Friday, you dirty bird.
M	DALE	Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt!
M	KURT	Maybe I should've spit on her arms.
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	Good evening, Mr. Gamble.
M	KURT	What the hell?
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	This is Gregory, your On Star rep. Our on-board sensors report that you have a damaged tail light.
M	KURT	Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know. We're being chased by a crazy man and he just smashed into us!
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	Oh dear. I will alert the local police authorities and direct them to your location.
M	NICK	No, wait! Don't call the police! They're already after us.
M	DALE	They think we murdered someone.
M	NICK	Why are you slowing down?!
M	KURT	I'm not! The engine died!
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	I have remotely disabled your engine.
M	KURT	Why would you do that, Gregory?!
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	It's a standard On Star safety protocol when we believe a driver has committed a crime.
M	KURT	I pay nineteen bucks a month for this fucking service!
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	Please stay with your vehicle. The police should arrive shortly.
M	DALE	I thought you were our friend, Gregory!
M	NICK	He's not stopping!
M	KURT	Oh, shit!
M	DALE	Shit, shit, shit...
M	KURT	I'm guessing you don't want to EXCHANGE INSURANCE information -- ?
F	HARKEN	Out of the car. All of you.
M	NICK	Look, Mr. Harken --
F	HARKEN	Shut the fuck up! I've got six bullets in here. So if I want to, I can shoot each of you twice, just like I did that bastard, Pellit. But if I do that, I'll have to spend the rest of my life running from the law or rotting in jail.
M	DALE	So, you're not gonna shoot us?
F	HARKEN	No. I have a better idea.
F	HARKEN	Unnnnhhhh!
M	NICK	What the -- ?!
F	HARKEN	Catch. 134 CONTINUED: (2) 134
F	HARKEN	Now I can tell the cops that when I discovered you three killed Pellit, you tried to kill me to shut me up.
M	KURT	That's crazy!
F	HARKEN	Is it? Because I don't see a shred of evidence proving that I killed Pellit. It's like I've always told you, Nick. Life is a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples.
M	ON STAR REP (V.O.)	Did I mention that this conversation is being recorded?
F	HARKEN	Who said that?
M	KURT	That's Gregory, our On Star rep. My name is Atmanand!
F	HARKEN	You can't -- this isn't -- 134 CONTINUED: (3) 134
M	NICK	I think this is gonna work out okay for us.
M	KURT	I told you.
M	DALE	Should we stop him?
M	KURT	Probably.
M	NICK	I've got this. This is for you, Gam Gam.
F	HARKEN	Get the fuck off me!
M	KURT	Hey, Harken, one last thing?
F	HARKEN	What?!
M	KURT	Your wife gives great head. 135 CONTINUED: 135
F	MARGIE	Oh, hey, Kurt. Come in.
M	KURT	Thanks, Margie. I just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job.
F	MARGIE	Thank you. Terrible what happened to him.
M	KURT	Yeah. Tough month for the Pellit family. Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know.
F	MARGIE	What baby?
M	KURT	Your baby.
F	MARGIE	I'm not pregnant.
M	KURT	Yeah, right. Look at that big belly.
F	MARGIE	I'm aware that I have a weight problem, Kurt. It just happens to manifest itself in my lower abdomen.
M	KURT	I... oh, my God. I'm really sorry, Margie --
F	MARGIE	Kurt, I know you were a favorite of Jack's. He was willing to overlook your inappropriate behavior with female clients and service people. But you should be aware, I'm not Jack. And I have very little tolerance for the mistreatment of women. So consider this your first strike.
M	KURT	How was I supposed to know you were just fat --
F	MARGIE	Strike two.
F	JULIA	Thank God it's Friday, right, Dale?
M	DALE	Yeah.
F	JULIA	Let's drill this patient and then you can drill me. Could we do it on top of the patient? I like the element of danger.
F	JULIA	You continue to surprise me, you weird little man.
F	JULIA	You like that? This getting you hot?
M	DALE	Oh, yeah.
F	JULIA	`I wish I was Dale's weenie so I could have sex with Julia.'
F	JULIA	What the hell?!
M	KENNY	Sorry, Dale. I couldn't keep it together anymore --
F	JULIA	What is this?
M	DALE	Julia, meet my old high school friend, Kenny.
M	KENNY	How do you do?
M	DALE	Kenny will do just about anything for fifty bucks and that's why I hired him to help me frame you. Your days of sexually assaulting me and your patients are over.
F	JULIA	Seriously? This is all you've got? Your word against mine? I'm a highly respected professional and you're two losers.
M	DALE	Three losers.
F	JULIA	You little bastard --
M	DALE	Shut up, Julia. Now, my fiancee and I are going to take a very expensive two week vacation which you're going to pay for. And then I'm going to come back to a rape- free workplace. Because if you so much as look at my ass, I'll have yours locked up.
M	KENNY	I don't suppose you could take a look at this molar --
F	JULIA	OUT! GET OUT!
M	CARTER	You wanted to see me, Mr. Waters? 139 CONTINUED: 139
M	NICK	Hi, Carter. Just wanted to check if you had a chance to finish those regional sales projections yet?
M	CARTER	Oh, I think I may need another day.
M	NICK	Okay. I was hoping to give them to the marketing guys today, but I can hold them off. In the future, it'd be great if you could tell me if you're going to miss a deadline.
M	CARTER	Sure. No problem, Mr. Waters.
M	NICK	Thanks, buddy.
M	NICK	It's good to be the boss.
