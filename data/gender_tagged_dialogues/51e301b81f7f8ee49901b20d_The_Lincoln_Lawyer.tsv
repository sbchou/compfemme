M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	EARL	I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty- Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs... You gettin' any of this, Mr. Haller? Not this morning. Mick watches the rain without seeing it.
M	MICK	Just keep your speed up, Earl. Earl kicks it, passes cars... Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him. Also laptop, cell- THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA v. LOUIS ROULET.
M	MICK	Earl-- buds. A command. Earl puts in earbuds, Rap cuts out. Into cell--
M	MICK (CONT'D)	This is Haller.
M	MAN'S VOICE OVER CELL	Where are you this morning? This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers,
M	MICK	On my way to Lancaster for a calendar call. Why, have you got something?
M	MAN'S VOICE (VAL)	I got a franchise player is what. Reaction Mick: He's heard it before...
M	VAL'S VOICE	I mean it, this guy could be money. But he goes before the judge at eleven.
M	MICK	Van Nuys by eleven could be hard--
M	VAL'S VOICE	But this client, listen Mick, his mother's lawyer just waltzed in
M	MICK	He's already got a lawyer?--
M	VAL'S VOICE	Strictly real-estate, doesn't know his ass about criminal. Will you listen?
M	VAL'S VOICE	Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the family's beach house in Malibu against the million in bail...
M	MICK	A million? What'd they book him on?
M	VAL'S VOICE	He picked up a girl last night-- Whatever went down she ended up pretty bad. Cops want Aggravated Assault with G.B.I.--
M	MICK	Has the D.A. filed yet?
M	VAL'S VOICE	No. See? I'm giving you ground floor. So make it work for me, Mick. Don't let him use the house, get him to go for my bond-- Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse,
M	MICK	Bring me around to the employee's gate, I'll talk my way in. I'm at the courthouse. Give me the name.
M	VAL'S VOICE	That would be Louis Roulet... R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel.
M	MICK	That's not how you spell the wheel but I got it, thanks.
M	VAL'S VOICE	Remember: I steered him to you.
M	MICK	You're on my Christmas list, Val. Lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate. "EMPLOYEES."
M	MICK	Harold. Hard Case. Don't hide from your lawyer, Harold, you know what I want to talk about. Caught, Harold slouches towards him.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Listen. when the judge comes in he's going to want to know if we're ready for trial...
M	HAROLD	We are.
M	MICK	We're not and you know why not. You haven't paid me. Rule one, remember Rule one, Harold? I get paid or I don't work.
M	HAROLD	Don't worry, I have your money...
M	MICK	Right, you have my money, I don't.
M	HAROLD	It's coming. I talked to my boys.
M	MICK	Harold-- I looked at the list of people I trust, and you know what? You're not on it.
M	HAROLD	The law says you can't just quit. The Judge won't let you. I looked it up. Mick's about to react to this jailhouse lawyering-- when a
M	MICK	Pay close attention, Harold. Goes to his seat...
M	MICK	Mickey Haller for the defense, your honor. If I may, I'd like to carry this over.
M	JUDGE ORTON	Do you have a reason, Mr. Haller?
M	MICK	I'm having trouble locating a witness, your honor. An indispensable witness. A Mr. Green. With emphasis. A look goes between the Judge and Mick.
M	JUDGE ORTON	How much time do you need? Would a week be enough?
M	MICK	I hope so, your honor. As your honor knows, Mr. Green can be hard to track down. A look of understanding. Judge nods--
M	JUDGE ORTON	I'm holding this over pending notification from counsel... Then gavels down, for the next case-- As Casey's led off,
M	HAROLD	That was bullshit, askin' for a delay-- I know what that was about.
M	MICK	And so does Judge Powell. He spent a lot of years as a defense lawyer, so he knows all about having to chase "Mr. Green," and he doesn't look kindly on defendants who don't pay their attorneys. Now do you get it, Harold? Casey won't look him in the eye-- RAP MUSIC IN AGAIN, TUPAC'S
M	MICK	This is Haller.
M	LORNA'S VOICE	And this is your office.
M	MICK	Actually I'm in my office. On my way to court in Van Nuys.
F	LORNA	That means Val reached you about his customer.
M	MICK	Oh yeah: "This is the franchise, Mick." According to Valenzuela every case is "the franchise." I'd have paid my mortgage ten times over by now--
F	LORNA	It could be he's right. I ran the name, the family's got a real estate business in Beverly Hills. The Times has them down for some big house sales, movie-star dollars... Sounds like the media might be interested. Call Sticks, tell him to show up. Any other calls?
F	LORNA	A couple of DUI's, I quoted them the house number. That's it, you're free after Roulet.
M	MICK	Good. Then I can go to County lock- up. Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road...
F	LORNA	You're going to see Gloria. Why do you waste time on her, Mickey? Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES,
M	EARL	Want me to do somethin' about this? 'Cause I can.
M	MICK	Ignore them, you're doing fine. FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through
M	MICK (CONT'D)	What can I say, Lorn, I've got a soft spot for redheads. Why do you think I married you?
F	LORNA	The divorce papers called it temporary insanity.
M	MICK	Lucky for you there was a cure. When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now--
M	EARL	Mr. Haller? Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN
M	EDDIE	Counsellor, how's it hanging?
M	MICK	Fine, Eddie, how's it with you? Hard Case called me from the pen, he said I might catch up to you. Said you're stalling his case til you see more green, is that right?
M	MICK	If you want me to work you've gat to pay me.
M	EDDIE	We paid you. Five thousand.
M	MICK	That's long gone. I could tell you half went to the aerial-photo expert. He's going to blow the state's case by showing that the DEA violated the air space over Harold's farm by flying too low... but you don't need to know that. All you need to know is, we had a deal. Time to refill the tank. Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln.
M	EDDIE	Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I heard you got three more. What's one man need with four Lincolns?
M	EDDIE	What? You want another five grand?
M	MICK	Ten. I'm flying the guy in from Kodak in New York, he wants business class...
M	EDDIE	And I want Harold back on the farm. He's the best farmer we got, if you know what I mean...
M	MICK	I don't. And I don't want to. Either pay me my money or go with the Public Defender the judge finds you. Of course he won't know much about air space, but--
M	EDDIE	Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We want you. He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope.
M	MICK	You had the whole ten ready. What if you'd backed me down to five?
M	EDDIE	This vest got lots of pocket. Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing.
M	MICK	Louis Roulet? LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	My name is Michael Haller. I had a call.
M	LOUIS	Yes-- Mr. Haller-- Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell. I-- called you because I need
M	MICK	You want me to represent you for your first appearance. I get twenty- five hundred for that. We can work out what comes next.
M	LOUIS	Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr. Haller-- I made a mistake with that woman, she was setting me up--
M	MICK	Keep your voice down. And don't say anything about the case, not til I've got you out on bail. Okay? Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm. Louis nods.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	I understand your family lawyer's in court?
M	LOUIS	That's him. Cecil Dobbs. Points to-- DOBBS, balding dignified WASP, a few rows in.
M	MICK	Is he ready to post bail?
M	LOUIS	He'll do whatever he has to. Mick nods, noting the tinge of desperation in Louis's voice.
M	MICK	Okay, tell me about yourself. How old are you?
M	LOUIS	Thirty-two...
M	MICK	Ties to the community? You grow up here, go to school?
M	LOUIS	Both. Beverly Hills, UCLA. I work for my mother's business...
M	MICK	"Windsor Estates?"
M	LOUIS	It's named for her second husband.
M	MICK	How much did you make last year? If I'm going to get you out I need to know everything.
M	LOUIS	My taxes last year said four hundred thousand. Just then, the White Junkie lurches forward towards Mick--
M	JUNKIE	I want a lawyer too, you got a card?
M	MICK	They'll have one for you out there. I need you to back up and leave us alone. Can you do that, pal? Junkie backs off, does just what Mick says. Impressing Louis.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Listen. They've put some heavy charges on you. The DA will probably ask for No-Bail...
M	LOUIS	No bail? Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and...
M	MICK	I said they're going to ask it. When was the last time you were arrested?
M	LOUIS	Never.
M	MICK	So if I checked your record--
M	LOUIS	--you'd find parking tickets. Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared,
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	This whole thing is--
M	MICK	We're not talking about the case, remember? Not even to the judge.
M	LOUIS	Don't I even say "Not guilty?"
M	MICK	Today's about setting arraignment, period. You say nothing.
M	LOUIS	Are you going to get me out?
M	MICK	I'm gonna try, Louis. One more thing: There are lots of lawyers. Why pick me?
M	LOUIS	I.. remembered your name from some case in the papers...
M	MICK	What case?
M	LOUIS	A drug case, I don't know.
M	MICK	You remember the name or anything?
M	LOUIS	No-- but you got the evidence thrown out against some guy-- Does it matter? I need your help, Mr. Haller. Off Mick, GO TO,
M	MICK	Are you the prosecutor who used to have the Roulet case? She starts to smile-- until his emphasis registers.
F	MAGGIE	Don't tell me. Son of a bitch, Haller.
M	MICK	Rules are rules.
F	MAGGIE	I wanted this one... Alright I'll go quietly. But after today's hearing, if you don't object.
M	MICK	Depends. You going for no-bail?
F	MAGGIE	That won't change with the prosecutor. Not with what your guy did. With which she shows him the photo: gruesome.
M	MICK	If he did it.
F	MAGGIE	Sure. "If." They only picked him up in her home with blood all over him, but it's a valid question...
M	MICK	I love it when you're sarcastic. Can I at least see the arrest report?
F	MAGGIE	Get it from whoever takes over. No favors on this one. Mick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion.
M	MICK	How's Hayley? A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting
F	MAGGIE	She's good. She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself...
M	MICK	How about this weekend? This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it.
F	MAGGIE	Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight. Only Mick-- don't cancel on her.
M	MICK	Judge, there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight
F	MAGGIE	With resources like this man has, it's always a risk-- let alone the fact that the victim was brutally
M	JUDGE	Ms. McPherson, the extent of her injuries are not the point. I'm setting bail at a million dollars... Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances--
M	VAL	What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us a franchise...
M	MICK	We'll see, Val...
M	VAL	There's the lawyer-guy, you get him to go for the cash-bond... MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY
M	MICK	Cecil Dobbs?
M	DOBBS	Mr. Haller. It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call...
M	MICK	Boy?
M	DOBBS	I've represented the family so long I think of Louis that way.
M	MICK	He did look a little frail. My advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take "the boy" home.
M	DOBBS	A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was thinking of putting up property...
M	MICK	No good. Assessing it will take days. By then Louis might be carrying somebody's child. So just tap Val for the bond, spring Louis, and take him to your office. We'll meet there at Four. And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to...
M	MICK	Yep. Media's already picked us up.
M	DOBBS	Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the press... Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes--
M	MICK	I saw you in there filming. What's your name?
M	CAMERAMAN	Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks."
M	MICK	You freelancing on this, Sticks?
M	STICKS	Your client's got profile, I figure I can sell it to local news.
M	MICK	How much?
M	STICKS	'Scuse me?
M	MICK	How much will they pay you for what you shot today?
M	STICKS	That depends. Seven, seven-fifty.
M	MICK	Suppose we take it off your hands for eight. Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Or do we make it a thousand. Sticks hesitates no longer. Takes the tape from the camera
M	MICK (CONT'D)	I can expense this, right?
M	DOS	Of course. Absolutely. Sticks takes the money, goes. Dobbs, impressed, beaming now--
M	DOBBS (CONT'D)	I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't my choice. You were Louis's. Frankly I'd never heard of you. But maybe I should have. Seems to me I've underestimated you.
M	MICK	Then let's talk about my fees. I'll need a hundred thousand up front. Working off five-fifty an hour, it'll come to another hundred thousand if we go to trial. That's estimating the trial at a week. Appeals, we start over. Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	I take it that's not a problem. Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice. MICK GETS IN,
M	LORNA'S VOICE	How'd it go, Mickey? We get the case?
M	MICK	We've got it if we want it. I'd still like to know the state's case, what they've got on him...
M	LORNA'S VOICE	What's the difference? 'Course we want the case... Mick says nothing. Gaze out the window. Then...
M	MICK	I've got an hour til he's released. Til then I'll be at county. With Gloria. Any calls?
M	LORNA'S VOICE	Only Sticks. He says he owes you five hundred next time he sees you.
M	MICK	Yeah he does.
F	GLORIA	Mickey Mantle. You're going to bat for me again? GLORIA, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets
M	MICK	You don't even know who the Mick was. You don't look good, Gloria.
F	GLORIA	Thanks. For coming, not for the compliment. Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees...
M	MICK	Something new for you, getting booked on possession of coke, along with the usual.
F	GLORIA	Dumb, I know. A guy paid me with it, I had it on me when I went to my next.
M	MICK	And your next was a cop. She shrugs/nods. Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a
F	GLORIA	Can't you get me into one of those rehab places where they get you straight?
M	MICK	We did a pre-trial rehab, last time. The D.A. won't go for it again. You may have to do some jail here.
F	GLORIA	I can't.
M	MICK	Yeah you can. They've got programs in jail, too. Look, you've had a long run. Maybe after this you can finally get out of the life.
F	GLORIA	And do what? Have kids and plant flowers? Look at me. Mick doesn't have an answer. Opens a notebook, gets to work.
M	MICK	Okay, tell me what happened.
F	GLORIA	I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on Santa Monica...
M	MICK	The one who paid you coke instead of money?
F	GLORIA	He had a shitload in there. I saw. Which gets Mick's attention. His wheels suddenly turning...
M	MICK	Do you know who he was?
F	GLORIA	No. He reached me on my website. He was Mexican or something.
M	MICK	Did you screen him?
F	GLORIA	Don't I screen 'em all?
M	MICK	off what, his driver's license?
F	GLORIA	No, his passport. I think his name was, Hector, or--
M	MICK	Hector what? Last name. Think.
M	MICK	Moya. Hector "Arrande" Moya is what you get if you run a trace. He's Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand Jury indictment down in Florida. The DEA wants him for drug trafficking. The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Leslie? They want him a lot.
M	LESLIE FAIRE	And your girl's looking to trade?
M	MICK	She'll give you his motel and room number.
M	LESLIE FAIRE	She'll also have to testify on the coke.
M	MICK	That's a No. Location only. Your guys take it from there. My investigator says Hector hasn't checked out yet.
M	LESLIE FAIRE	What's she want in exchange?
M	MICK	You drop charges, and all she does is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation. The facility at USC-Med would be nice. Or do I take this straight to the Feds? Which, though veiled, is a threat. Leslie hates this.
M	MICK	Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin. Mr. Levin's my investigator. Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long,
M	DOBBS	Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr. Haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning. Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased.
M	MARY WINDSOR	I have a check for you, Mr. Haller. And slides it towards him in an envelope. Mick, tries not to
M	MICK	I'm going to need that to come from your son, Mrs. Windsor. You can give him the money so he can write the check. But I want the check to come from Louis. He's my client and that's got to be clear from the start. No offense. She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Thank you. I'll expect you to support your son through this in other ways. If you're willing.
M	MARY WINDSOR	Don't be silly. I'll back my son come hell or high water. These ridiculous charges. That ridiculous woman.
M	MICK	It's good to know you'll be there when we need you.
M	MARY WINDSOR	But not now, is that it?
M	MICK	We'll be going over the case. The D.A. could make you testify about what you hear. Attorney privilege doesn't cover you. Mary Windsor's motionless a moment. Rather than respond, she
M	MARY WINDSOR	I will see you at dinner. And goes. Dobbs gets the door for her. When she's gone:
M	LOUIS	My mother built a good business. From the ground up.
M	MICK	I've got no trouble believing that. I say we get started. All agree, they sit, Mick starts up--
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Our first choice is whether we waive our right to a speedy trial.
M	LOUIS	No. I want this behind me.
M	MICK	You sure? You can stretch things out, enjoy your freedom. Most clients...
M	LOUIS	Guilty clients, you mean. I want this over. Mick's struck by how firm.
M	MICK	Fine. We go to trial right away. Puts more pressure on the D.A.
M	DOBBS	Or maybe the case never even goes to trial. Our firm's clout is considerable. Pressure can be brought to bear--
M	MI C K	Don't kid yourself, Cecil. No way the state is dropping these charges. In fact, they've already upped them-- to improve their negotiating position.
M	LOUIS	There won't be any negotiating. No plea bargain, no nothing. I'm not going to jail for something I didn't do.
M	MICK	It might not be jail.
M	LOUIS	Even if I walk. I'm innocent and if there's a trial I want to get on the stand and tell the jury I'm innocent. If that's a problem we can part company right now. Mick looks at the young man. Evaluating. Then...
M	MICK	Time to tell me what happened. Louis. Removes his Ray-Bans. SUDDENLY:
M	LOUIS (V.O.)	I was having a drink at Morgan's, Ventura Boulevard...
M	MICK (V.0.)	Morgan's, that's a singles bar, right? Camera finds LOUIS at the bar, checking out the action...
M	LOUIS (V.O. )	Right, nice place, good for pick- ups. That's why I was there. Looking to get laid, pure and simple.
M	BACK TO, LAW OFFICE	Mick, to Raul, who's holding a dark blue file:
M	MICK	Raul, what's the file say about the girl?
M	RAUL	Regina Campo, goes by "Reggie." Twenty six. An actress and a telephone solicitor.
M	DOBBS	And hoping to retire. Soon as she sues my client.
M	MICK	Did you know her before last night?
M	LOUIS (V.O.)	I'd seen her around, but never spoke to her. She was always with a guy. She was with one last night. She slows as she passes Louis, whispers, her lips brush his She just laid her address on me. On a napkin.
M	MICK (V.0.)	But she was still with a guy? Reggie returns to: THE GUY at the bar: 40s, hard like a vet.
M	LOUIS (V.0.)	I got it that she wasn't too into her date. She told me he'd be gone by ten if I was interested.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	I didn't keep the napkin. I work in real estate, I remember addresses.
M	MICK	Raul. Check that file you've got and see if the Police report has any of this. While Raul looks, Mick explains to Louis and Dobbs, can't
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Raul's already worked us a little miracle. He's managed to score a copy of the discovery file, everything the D.A.'s got. They'd have to turn it over eventually but it could have been weeks. Under which, Raul's checked the blue file, and...
M	RAUL	Nope. They don't have the other guy. They don't even have the bar.
M	MICK	All they've got is, Louis shows up and beats the crap out of her?
M	RAUL	That's it.
M	LOUIS	That is such bullshit--
M	MICK	Just keep telling me.
M	LOUIS (V.0.)	I didn't want to walk in on anything, so I got there early. His POV, shadow-figure of Hard-Guy approaching in the dark..
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	I waited til the guy came out.
M	MICK (V.0.)	You see what he was driving?
M	LOUIS (V.0.)	A Corvette. Yellow. Hard-Guy gets in the Corvette, pulls out. So he leaves, and you go in... She saw it was me... The hallway inside was tight. I had to walk past her, y'know, so she could close the door. So I had to turn my back to her. We SEE this, she's behind him... as we hear, simply... Then, that was it.
M	MICK	What was what?
M	LOUIS	She hit me with something and I went down. It got black fast. SUDDEN POP TO, LOUIS STRUCK FROM BEHIND... Blacking out as he
M	MICK	Okay then. What do you remember next?
M	LOUIS	Waking up with two guys sitting on me. Holding me down. Couple of faggots from next door.
M	RAUL	Police report has them, homosexual couple from down the hall...
M	LOUIS	Like I said. Faggots. To which Raul says nothing. After a beat--
M	MICK	Go on, Louis.
M	LOUIS	I was still foggy when the cops came... BACK TO, LIVING ROOM... Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind She was on the couch telling all these lies... PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE
F	REGGIE	.he was like an animal! He said he'd rape me and kill me... then rape me again when I was dead... Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody.
M	LOUIS (V.O. )	That's when I saw she'd set it up.
M	MICK	Set it up how?
M	LOUIS	Put blood on my hand. My left hand. But I'm right-handed, I'd use my right if I was going to... punch someone. Which is crazy. Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air. Inept.
M	DOBBS	Louis never hit anyone in his life.
M	RAUL	What she did made sense. It's the right side of her face that was hit, she had to bloody your left.
M	MICK	Louis: You said she opened the door a crack. Did you see her face?
M	LOUIS	Not all of it... Mainly her eye. Her left eye.
M	RAUL (V.0.)	That's it!... BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. Raul... mimes the opening of the door...
M	RAUL (CONT'D)	She already had the injuries, on the right. She was hiding it from him when he steps in...
M	MICK	And then she clocks him?
M	LOUIS	Yes.
M	MICK	So our case is, she beat herself up? Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE...
M	MICK (CONT'D)	We're saying, she pounded her face into hamburger meat, or had her boyfriend do it, hoping some far- off day a jury would give her a big fat reward?
M	LOUIS	She must have.
M	DOBBS	Of course. She saw his Porsche, his Rolex, it's known the family has money... I'll wager she's already filed in civil court. Mick. Thinks. Then, to Raul--
M	MICK	Okay, the police report. Let's hear how Reggie tells it.
M	RAUL (V. 0. )	"According to the victim, she was at home alone when the suspect presented himself at the door as someone she knew..." Louis is there, talks MOS. Reggie opens the rest of the way. "Upon letting him in, she was immediately struck..." WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face,
M	MICK (V.0.)	Does it say he knocked her down? She falls... Louis flies down on top of her...
M	RAUL (V.0.)	Yeah, then straddled her. "Held the victim by the neck until she agreed to cooperate..." Louis does as described, strangle-hold... Eventually lets her "The suspect maintained a position behind her, holding a knife against the left side of her throat..."
M	LOUIS	This isn't my knife.
M	MICK	Raul, are his prints on there?
M	RAUL	That's what the report says. I'm not surprised, if she put blood on his hands she's gonna put prints on his knife...
M	LOUIS	I told you, it's not "my" knife! Mick ignores, still intent on Raul's reading...
M	MICK	Okay, how's she say he went down?
M	RAUL	"As Ms. Campo entered the hallway, she pushed the intruder backwards into a large floor vase..."
M	RAUL (V.0.)	"Realizing her attacker would catch her at the front door, she ducked into the kitchen and seized a bottle of vodka..." Louis, struggling to his feet, HIT ON THE HEAD from behind..
M	MICK (V. D. )	And clonked him when he got up?
M	RAUL (V.0.)	That's how she tells it.
M	LOUIS	Those are all lies, this is bull--
M	MICK	If everything she said is a lie, this will be the easiest case ever. I'll tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea. But Louis... You swear it's all lies? Is there anything you aren't telling me? Mick's eyes burn into him. Louis answers simply.
M	LOUIS	Nothing. Mick holds him in a long, hard, assessing stare. Over which, The way Louis tells it...
M	MICK	.it's just quirky enough. Mick and Raul coming out, after having a few. It's a lawyers'
M	RAUL	Quirky enough for what?
M	MICK	To be true. Maybe it went down just like he says. Anyway there's a. chance. In a party of law-types, we GLIMPSE MAGGIE, who catches sight
M	RAUL	An innocent client. Jeezus.
M	MICK	Yeah. But you know what my father said about innocent clients... Maggie's overheard this, gives the answer.
F	MAGGIE	He said there's no client as scary as an innocent man. Mick, seeing her, smiles and continues, a little tipsy...
M	MICK	That's right. Because if you screw up and he goes to prison, it scars you for life. There's only one verdict. You've got to put an N.G. on the board. Hey Mags. She reads the state he's in.
F	MAGGIE	Raul, if you let a man drive in his condition I think I can charge you both. The guys look at each other. Maggie swipes the keys--
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	I'll drive him to his house.
M	RAUL	And how will you get home?
F	MAGGIE	My friends brought me. I'll keep the car, he can pick it up at my place in the morning. Get in. And she gets in the driver's side, waits. Mick to Raul--
M	MICK	Okay, you know the moves. Make the rounds, check out Morgan's Bar...
M	RAUL	And Mr. Corvette...
M	MICK	And Regina Campo. The way Louis says she came on's got me wondering. Mick gets in and closes the door. As Maggie starts it up and
M	TUPAC	"God bless the dead and buried nigga, Don't worry if you see God first, Tell him shit got worse..."
F	MAGGIE	You've got to be kidding me.
M	MICK	Earl lays this stuff on me.
F	MAGGIE	Where is Earl tonight?
M	MICK	I never keep him this late.
F	MAGGIE	Hasn't he worked your fee off yet?
M	MICK	A while ago. But he likes driving, keeps him out of trouble... He's taking courses, too, in music.
F	MAGGIE	You can't tell by this stuff. She snaps the rap OFF.
M	MICK	You get used to it. Besides, Tupac, he helps me understand my clients. Most of them go to school on his
F	MAGGIE	Not Roulet.
M	MICK	Not Louis, no. Louis is my franchise player, he pays for all the rest... After a beat... Office gossip...
F	MAGGIE	I heard Smithson assigned Ted Minton to your case.
M	MICK	Never heard of him.
F	MAGGIE	He's brand new. Bright, though. Smithson's protegee. Naturally. Georgetown, buys his suits at Brooks, above all he's a guy... Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms... Moonlight
M	MICK	Lorna made me my schedule. Saturday's fine to take Hayley.
F	MAGGIE	Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob movie...
M	MICK	I'm all over it. How's she doing?
F	MAGGIE	I'll know when I drop you and get home to relieve the sitter... What?
M	MICK	Moonlight becomes you. That's not doing me any good, Haller.
M	MICK	Thanks. She nods You're welcome. And pulls away. Mick's smile fades
M	VOICE OF A CHILD (HAYLEY)	Daddy, Mommy said I could call and say G'night. Sorry you're not there. G'night, Daddy.
M	MICK	Me too, baby. Then Mick hits "Play" again. BEEP.
M	VOICE OF HAYLEY	Daddy, Mommy said I could call... Off a FRAMED PHOTO: HAYLEY, B, curls, Irish eyes...
M	JUDGE FLYNN, 60	Top o' the mornin', Mr. McGinley! You know what day it is? Mick's client, DARIUS McGINLEY, black, 2B: In chains. Mick is
M	DARIUS	The day I get my sentence?
M	JUDGE FLYNN	That too. But it's also St. Patrick's Day. A day to revel in your Irish heritage. Darius doesn't get Flynn's joke. Mick cautions Darius, low--
M	MI CK	He's an asshole but just be cool. Darius scowls... under which Mick notices that RAUL has
M	JUDGE FLYNN	Do you know the origin of your name, Mr. McGinley?
M	DARIUS	Slave-holder, I 'spect. Why do I care who that motherfucka be?
M	MICK	Darius I told you--
M	DARIUS	The man's dissin' me! Alright: If you don't care about your name, then I don't. Let's get on with your sentence for the sale of rock cocaine and get you off to prison, shall we? Darius, pissed. Raul waves to Mick, wants to talk...
M	MICK	What couldn't wait, Raul?
M	RAUL	Wanna see a movie?
M	RAUL'S VOICE	We caught a break. The owner had a camera installed to watch his register after he caught the help dipping in last year...
M	MICK'S VOICE	And here comes Louis. Said as LOUIS enters frame, sits. MOS, orders a drink. We're:
M	RAUL	I had the tape transferred to disc, so I could manipulate, y'know... Raul starts to ZOOM... Shows Mick, on the SCREEN...
M	RAUL (CONT'D)	I'd like you to meet Reggie Campo.
M	RAUL'S VOICE	And Mr. X. The Corvette-man.
M	MICK'S VOICE	Are you sure?
M	RAUL'S VOICE	Wouldn't have popped a grand for the tape if I wasn't. Now watch... STARTS PLAYING IMAGE AGAIN, widen to full shot. Nothing for like a half-hour... He RACES THE TAPE FORWARD... Time code FLIES... He slows it Then... Here. Mr. X gets up, with pack of cigarettes, goes...
M	MICK'S VOICE	I know the place. They got a smoking porch out front.
M	RAUL'S VOICE	That's where he goese. Giving Reggie her chance. Watch her. She passes behind Louis, trails her hand along his
M	MICI{' S VOICE	That's not how he said it went down. He said she gave him her address, on a napkin...
M	RAUL'S VOICE	Whoa, wait, she just went to the little girls'. But she's gotta come back, no? And NOW HE FAST-FORWARDS TAPE AGAIN... And this time she
M	MICK	Do the cops have this?
M	RAUL	How can they? I got the one and only. It ain't a copy.
M	MICK	You're exceedingly beautiful.
M	RAUL	Wait. .Reggie and X decide to split...
M	RAUL'S VOICE	Check out his hand, his watch.
M	MICK'S VOICE	It's on his left. That's no good...
M	MICK	It means he's right-handed. But the facial blows were from the left...
M	RAUL	Slow down. You said you knew Morgan's. So you oughta realize... This image is in the mirror over the bar. That's how the owner set the camera to watch his register.
M	MICK	So everything's backwards...
M	RAUL	And X punches with his left.
M	MICK	I told you you were beautiful. Anything else?
M	RAUL	Yeah. But it's not on the tape. You know how you were wondering about Regina?
M	MICK	Yeah? Raul just looks at him. Off Mick,
M	MICK	Mickey Haller. Here to see Louis.
M	ROBIN	Mr. Roulet is with someone. He can't be disturbed. It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to --
M	ROBIN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, Mr. Roulet, this man just came back here--
M	LOUIS	It's okay, Robin. You can go. Robin exits. Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	I was setting up a showing.
M	MICK	There won't be any showings in Pelican Bay.
M	LOUIS	Where's that?
M	MICK	It's a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders. You'll fit in real good in your loafers.
M	LOUIS	What's the matter?
M	MICK	You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to go and see the new prosecutor, who's doing everything he can to put you away, and now I find out you've been lying. Tell me about Reggie Campo.
M	LOUIS	What about her? I've told you--
M	MICK	You didn't tell me. That you were going to pay her for sex. You think it's hard to find out somebody's not Snow White?
M	LOUIS	Alright yes, I was going to pay. She wrote down a price on the napkin, four hundred dollars...
M	MICK	Why didn't you tell me this in Cecil's office?
M	LOUIS	I didn't want my mother to know. Cecil tells her everything. And can we keep it down? Her office is on the other side of that door... Mick looks at Louis's concern. Believes it. Easing up...
M	MICK	This changes things. You see that, don't you?
M	LOUIS	I'm not a lawyer. Explain it to me.
M	MICK	Alright I will. You know that guy on the Venice boardwalk? The one who has all those plates spinning on sticks?
M	LOUIS	
M	MICK	Just listen. A bunch of spinning plates: that's the state's case. In the middle is a big one. It's a fucking platter. And if that falls it takes the others down with it. The big plate is the victim. The only witness against you. I knock her down, the act is over and the crowd goes home. No trial. Mick has Louis' attention now.
M	LOUIS	You can make this trial go away?
M	MICK	We've lost time. You concealed from me the fact that could do it. It comes down to why.
M	LOUIS	Why what?
M	MICK	Why would a guy with a Porsche and a Rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway? The answer is, he wouldn't. And when you see that you see the set- up, the trap. And suddenly it's the defendant who looks like the victim. Louis gets it. Penitent.
M	LOUIS	You're going to the prosecutor now?
M	MICK	Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted Minton. He wants to give me the discovery file. Poor guy doesn't know that Raul already got it. He's new to felonies but he's no dope. When he hears his vic's a hooker he'll know we've knocked all his plates down.
M	LOUIS	Then it'll be over?
M	MICK	No promises, Louis. Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to
F	MRS. WINDSOR	I didn't know you were here. Is there news?
M	LOUIS	There will be, Mother. And puts out a hand to Mick. Grateful. Hesitating half a Louis and his Mother. Regard each other. Face to face.
M	SECRETARY	Are these for A.D.A. Knight?
M	KURLEN	Yeah, and they're my only copies. I'll wait while you copy them.
M	SECRETARY	I'll have to ask her... But, he holds them back. Stares. She yields...
M	SECRETARY (CONT'D)	I'll run them for you now.
M	KURLEN	Just what I wanted to hear. She goes. Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late--
M	KURLEN (CONT'D)	Well, look who's come callin'.
M	MICK	Detective Kurlen.
M	KURLEN	Puttin' a case away. Guy drowned his neighbor's kid in a tub to see what it felt like. It won't shock you to hear he was high...
M	MICK	Thanks for clearing that up.
M	KURLEN	If he gets San Quentin, maybe he can look up your boy Jesus Martinez. Mick bristles at this reference. Turns away again. To a
M	MICK	Is Minton back yet?--
M	SECRETARY #2	He'll be a few more minutes, sir. Kurlen, seeing he's drawn blood, continues to needle.
M	KURLEN	How's he doin' up there, anyway? He make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me team?
M	MICK	I haven't talked to him.
M	KURLEN	I guess once they plead guilty, they're not much use to you. He went down forever, right?
M	MICK	He got life, but he'll be out. I don't know when.
M	KURLEN	Too bad. 'Cause his victim, Martha Renteria? She's dead forever.
M	MICK	You don't have to remind me you were lead dick on that. Kurlen grins. Shakes his head.
M	KURLEN	How's a guy like you sleep at night? With the scum you represent. Mick's had enough. Moves closer. To tell him a story.
M	MICK	I had a client once, he decapitated his ex-wife, then kept her head in the refrigerator. Naturally you got him off.
M	MICK	The D.A. got greedy. Tried to pile on two unsolved murders, trick up evidence to stick my guy with them. It's called the justice system, we don't do things that way.
M	KURT. EN	So your guy's out walkin' around. He ever do it again?
M	MICK	I don't know. I never heard of him after that.
M	KURLEN	But he could have. Fuck you, Haller. No. Fuck the D.A. Before Kurlen can react-- TED MINTON arrives. Fresh-faced,
M	TED	Mr. Haller? Sorry you had to wait. I hope it'll be worth your while. He gives Mick a thin, white-covered file from a briefcase.
M	MICK	Looks kinda thin for a discovery
M	TED	Yes well-- We can go to my office--
M	MICK	I've got a question first. He takes from his pocket: Raul's DISC. The DVD Raul gave him.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	You have something to play this on?
M	TED	What else do you have? The simple, polite question throws Mick.
M	MICK	Look Ted, let's cut the bullshit. Not only is your so-called victim a working prostitute, but we've got her on tape soliciting my client! Maybe you're new, but you gotta know how hard it's gonna be to convince a jury a guy would have to rape a hooker to have sex with her--
M	TED	Nothing you're telling me's going to change my offer.
M	MICK	Offer? You're making an offer? going forward? Not the way Mick thought it would go. Ted goes on...
M	TED	We'll drop the charges to Assault with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual Battery. The guidelines put him at seven years, maybe he'll do four. Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time...
M	MICK	.What am I missing here?... Ted stays innocent-looking. Blank.
M	EARL	Got you the good stuff, Hayley...
F	HAYLEY	Thank you, Earl. Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds
M	EARL	Man's got your ride ready...
M	MICK	Go on, I'll hold your ice cream. Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and There's something right in front of me and I'm not seeing it. On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
F	HAYLEY	You said we',re going to the movies! You promised me last week!
M	MICK	Daddy's got to talk to somebody. You stay with Earl. Mick gets out, Hayley stays...
M	LOUIS	What's happened? Is it over? You said it would be over by now--
M	MICK	That was before I found out you were still lying to me. He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE, You know what that is? It's a picture of your knife. The one you had on you when you went to Reggie Campos. The one the cops have. Look at the blood on the blade. Look at the initials. Louis is stuck for an answer--
M	MICK (CONT'D)	That's why Ted Minton didn't care when I told him Reggie's a prostitute. What's it matter, when he's got a knife with her blood and your initials on it?
M	LOUIS	This wasn't the knife in the file--
M	MICK	That's right. The file Raul got us was a loaded deck. The cops must have been on to him, because they used it to set us up. So we'd think they had nothing, when in fact they had enough to put your Hugo Boss, golf-playing ass away for twenty years! Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off. Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Explain to me why you lied about the knife.
M	LOUIS	I didn't lie. I said the one in the picture wasn't mine. Mick frowns/grins at the answer...
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	I said it twice! Nobody listened! What are you now, a lawyer? A clever, third-rate fucking lawyer with smart-ass technicalities? "You said it wasn't yours"-- What you should have said was, "I had a knife but this isn't it!" What did you think, it would just go away? You brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute, Louis! How am I supposed to make that look like she set you up?
M	LOUIS	1. Did. Not. Do this. Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look.
M	MICK	Then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom-made knife, serrated tip, with "LR" engraved on the blade?
M	LOUIS	I always carry it. For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes.
M	MICK	You always carry it.
M	LOUIS	Yes. In real estate we show homes, to people we don't know. This one time... He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead...
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	My mother. She was showing a place. It was in Bel-Air, so she thought it was okay to go alone, even though there was a man at the time who had raped some women that way. He was there.
M	MICK	Who was there?
M	LOUIS	The man. He raped her. When she didn't come back, I went to the house and found her. Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility...
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	That's when she stopped showing property. I do the selling now. And I started carrying a knife. Always. Mick turns it over. Finally...
M	MICK	That's quite a story, Louis. Your mother will have to testify.
M	LOUIS	We don't want that. I don't give a damn what you think we want. From now on you do what I tell you while I try this case. Do I make myself clear? Louis is silent. Mick looks off. Towards Hayley, in the car.
M	MICK	If she wasn't so darn heavy I'd carry her all night, I swear.
F	MAGGIE	Defense lawyers will swear to anything...
F	MAGGIE	You look like you're in a daze.
M	MICK	It turned into a rough week. Being with Hayley was the only high. She can't find anything to say. As he heads out again...
F	MAGGIE	Nobody's seen you at Four Green Fields lately.
M	MICK	I stopped going. Too much of a scene.
F	MAGGIE	Yeah well. If you start going again. Now she has his attention.
M	MICK	If I start again, what? She's awkward. Smiles, shrugs to cover--
F	MAGGIE	Bunch of us from the office are there. Tuesdays, after work. An invitation. S-zrprising him.
M	MICK	I'll keep it in mind.
F	MAGGIE	Okay.
M	MICK	Okay. Maggie sees him, lights up a little--
F	MAGGIE	Haller! Let him in, girls! Buy you a beer?
M	MICK	You won't make it to the bar...
F	MAGGIE	Then let's share this. They fight to a table for two, edge of the crowd. When he
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	We've had a taste of each other before. He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few. He drinks.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Feeling a little better tonight? Or did Ted Minton sandbag you?
M	MICK	Yeah, that's exactly what--
F	MAGGIE	With that guy Corliss, right? I told them using that dirtbag was a bullshit play. But you'll take the the guy's head off on the stand... Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Whoops, I shouldn't say that...
M	MICK	So Ted talked to you about Corliss?
F	MAGGIE	Huh? It was me who sent him to Ted. Corliss thought it was my case because I handled first appearance. I'm telling you too much.
M	MICK	Nah, nothing I don't know, they always use a professional snitch... I mean Corliss has done this before, right?
F	MAGGIE	Can't we just forget work and have a friendly Guiness?
M	MICK	How about we go somewhere to eat? So we can talk about our daughter. Let me tell my friends I'm leaving. She goes. And Mick, quick, writes the name CORLISS on napkin.
F	MAGGIE	I'll bet you didn't know Sponge-Bob movies could be so much fun.
M	MICK	The fun's watching her. Maggie likes this. Touch glasses. After a quiet moment...
F	MAGGIE	You didn't know Minton had Corliss til I blabbed, did you.
M	MICK	He was hiding something, I thought it might be a jailhouse snitch...
F	MAGGIE	You got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know. Except I was already drunk. Good point, right?
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Hayley's probably asleep. I gotta go relieve the sitter-- Only I don't think I can drive myself home.
M	MICK	one good turn. I'll drive you.
F	MAGGIE	And will you take me back to get my car in the morning?
F	MAGGIE	This is not fair to her. Waking up and finding you here. She'll get her hopes up.
M	MICK	How'd she get in here?
F	MAGGIE	She comes in here when she has nightmares. She has nightmares.
M	MICK	So she sleeps in here a lot?
F	MAGGIE	Don't start. You have no idea what it's like raising a child alone. He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone.
M	MICK	Look-- I'll leave-- then come back in an hour. We'll go together to get your car then I can take her to
F	MAGGIE	Just like that? You're gonna start taking her to school?
M	MICK	Don't you remember what we talked about last night?
F	MAGGIE	I thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case-- or get me into bed--
M	MICK	I can't win with you--
F	MAGGIE	Not when you're being a defense lawyer! Do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it? Me trying to get dirtbags off the street, you keeping them there--
F	MAGGIE	Just go! An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE.
M	MICK	Sorry. It's work.
M	WAITRESS	I just hope you catch the bastard who did it to her. And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide
M	MICK	Martha Renteria. DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET... Mick's fingers fly through
M	MICK'S VOICE	I wish you'd called me before you talked to the cops, Jesus... I seen my picture every place! They was gonna bring me in, so...
M	MICK	But you told Kurlen you were in her apartment. He didn't have that, he doesn't even have any prints...
M	MARTINEZ	That shit I tol' is true, man! I seen her at the Cobra Room, she said if I paid we could go to her place, she didn't care about the other guy...
M	MICK	Nobody saw any "other guy"...
M	MARTINEZ	There was another guy, bpi guy that she was talking to...
M	MICK	Plus the coroner says her vagina was brutalized...
M	MARTINEZ	Are you my lawyer or what, man? When I left that chick was fine! I fucked her but I didn't hurt her-- You ain't even listenin'--
M	MICK	Three people saw you throwing a knife into the L.A. River...
M	MARTINEZ	'Cause I had that knife in my car! I knew they was gonna find it...
M	MICK	If all you did was fuck her then why didn't you leave any prints? The place was wiped down... But your semen was on the towel, you forgot you wiped your penis on that towel...
M	MARTINEZ	I didn't forget nothing! I jus' used that towel, then I give the chick the money and I left!
M	MICK	It's not gonna make.
M	MARTINEZ	Don't say that!
M	MICK	Jesus they want the death penalty! I can see to it that never happens, but not if you don't plead.
M	MARTINEZ	You want me to say I did this? Mick hesitates but stays level. Unbending. No choice.
M	MILK	Jesus, there's a deal to be made. I can do that. I can get you Life. Life means you'll do fifteen...
M	MARTINEZ	I'm innocent! Inocente! You know what that means? Mick just looks at him.
M	MICK	I'm not going to ask you how you are because I know. Martinez glares at him, then spits on the floor.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Look. I need to ask some questions.
M	MARTINEZ	you didn't have no questions then. Never ask, Did you kill that girl?
M	MICK	I am trying to make it right. Martinez is silent. Cold.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Tell me again about the Cobra Room.
M	MARTINEZ	Tell you what? She was workin'. Dancin'. LATER, AFTER THE ACT-- Camera finds Renteria half-curling Then she came and talked to me... She's whispering, Martinez is loving it-- She tol' me I could take her home. I did, but I didn't kill her. You said there was another guy... Disentangling from Martinez, Martha slides toward a MAN,
M	MARTINEZ (V.0.)	Si, she talk to him too, but she come back to me. Though she's with the other man, she glances back at Jesus... Frustrated, Mick complies-- but calls--
M	MICK	Guard! Long beat. Guard enters. Clean-Marine. Mick shows the stack.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	I need him to look at these.
M	GUARD	You can't give him anything.
M	MICK	But if you won't let him close to the glass, how can he see them?
M	GUARD	That's not my problem.
M	MICK	All right, but can you stay a minute? If he IDs one of these mug- shots I need you to witness it.
M	GUARD	Don't drag me into your bullshit. And goes.
M	MICK	Godammit. Try. See if one is the guy. Mick holds up one after another. Martinez shakes his head no-- Mick holds it up. Off Jesus, as his eyes narrow...
M	RAUL	Cool it, Ahab... C'mon in, Mick... Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog--
M	MICK	I helped myself.
M	RAUL	It's okay. I owe you, the way I let you down on that discovery file--
M	MICK	It wasn't you. The cops set you up. Who was it slipped you the file, anyway?
M	RAUL	Some guy in vice I play cards with. Lonnie Fry. You don't know him.
M	MICK	You're right, I don't. But I know who his partner was, when he was in homicide. Kurlen.
M	RAUL	That prick. I'll make him sorry.
M	MICK	Don't bother. We've got bigger problems. The way Mick says it. Raul sits, asks--
M	RAUL	Like what? Where were you today anyway? You were hard to reach...
M	MICK	Cell phones don't work too well where I was. Raul waits. Knows this is why Mick came here.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	I came to tell you a story. About Jesus Martinez.
M	RAUL	You were at San Quentin.
M	MICK	It's about what happened after he left Martha Renteria's apartment.
M	RAUL	After he killed her?
M	MICK	He never killed her. He went there, had sex, flushed the condom--
M	RAUL	Wiped his prick on the pink towel--
M	MICK	And then went home. The story starts after he left. The real killer.
M	MICK	The real killer. She lets him in.
M	MICK	Maybe he fakes like it's still Martinez and he forgot something. Or maybe it was an appointment... We see the door open but we don't see who enters... The other guy from the club? The one Jesus said he bid against?
M	NICK (V.0.)	Right. He comes in, punches her a few times to soften her up... Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun... Then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom... We SEE the knife-tip against her throat... Only she isn't lucky like Reggie Campo will be. He climbs on top, puts on a condom, rapes her... And when he's done he stabs her over and over, fifty-two times, while he works out something in his sick fucking mind. We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then-- Do you need to ask what kind of knife it was, based on the wounds?
M	RAUL	A short-blade folding knife...
M	MICK	Or whose face Martinez picked out of the mug-shots I brought him? No. No need. A beat. Raul's dog barks from outside.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Of course the story goes on from there. From there it's about the lawyer Martinez gets himself...
M	RAUL	Don't do this to yourself...
M	MICK	The lawyer who just assumes he did it because of the DNA. The lawyer who gets him the best deal he can, and feels pretty good, because the deal keeps his client off Death Row... and this guy, this lawyer, he's all about the deal, see?
M	RAUL	Mick-- You can't beat yourself up for what you didn't know--
M	MICK	I just saw him and he's twenty-six going on forty. He's a little guy. You know what happens to the little ones up there. A beat. Mick drinks. He has a type. Roulet. It's more than a type, Renteria and Campo, you put their faces together you get the same face...
M	RAUL	You better take it easy...
M	MICK	Listen, I was thinking about this the whole way down on the plane-- That night with Renteria? It was like he hit the jackpot-- got to do his thing and get away with it. Then he's in a bar, sees Reggie--
M	RAUL	Who he's seen before, remember--
M	MICK	Yeah but tonight he sees who she looks like.
M	RAUL	Renteria?
M	MICK	Right. And he's right back there. Mick, we're talking about a really
M	MICK	We're talking about a killer at work. You know that video from the bar? Just like you, he saw that Mr. X was left-handed.
M	RAUL	Smart as the devil--
M	MICK	He knows what he's doing. Reggie's the luckiest woman alive.
M	RAUL	You think there are others? With that face, or--
M	MICK	You find out. Dig into Roulet. "All you'll find is parking tickets," I don't buy that anymore. Check out knife-murders of women. Not just the unsolved ones, Martha Renteria was a closed case.
M	RAUL	Look man, I can't throw a net like that. I'm just one guy! You gotta bring the cops in.
M	MICK	I can't. He's my client. That's why he hired me. Raul looks up, startled by this. Mick lays it out... I was thinking about that on the plane too: He was worried I might hear about the case and put it together. But if he was my client, I'd be bound to keep my mouth shut and protect him. Attorney-client privilege.
M	MICK	I told you: He knows what he's doing.
M	RAUL	You got one guy in prison for what your other client did. What are you going to do, Mick? A beat.
M	MICK	I'm working on it.
M	MICK	This is Haller...
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	Did you get my messages?
M	MICK	Maggie, no, I was up in San Francisco for the day...
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	No you weren't. You don't go to San Francisco, you go to San Quentin. Must have been seeing a client...
M	MICK	You always were too smart for me. Is Hayley okay?
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	She's good. Look, she's playing soccer tomorrow, and she wants you to come to the match. You've started something, Mickey...
M	MICK	Fine, I look forward to it.
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	You'll need to pick her up at noon. But, under this, he sees, DOWN THE HALLWAY, light from a
M	MICK	Noon, I'll do that. See you then. And hangs up before she can say goodbye.. And Stops. Freezes. Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark...
M	MICK	What the hell are you doing here?
M	LOUIS	Funny thing is I've been here before. I was offered the house to show, never gave back the key--
M	MICK	Get out of my house! Now!
M	LOUIS	But, sees Mick noticing-- the ELECTRONIC ANKLET on his leg--
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	Your friend Valenzuela put this on. A tracer. As if I were going anywhere.
M	MICK	I said Get up! Get up and get out of this house! Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes--
M	LOUIS	I couldn't reach you! I'm on trial for my life, Mick, and I get nervous when I can't reach yout And you were away all day. Like you told "Maggie." Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white.
M	MICK	You don't come near this house again, do you understand me? We aren't friends, we aren't partners, you're my client, eriod--
M	LOUIS	Just what I wanted to remind you of. I'm your client. Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then:
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	Besides, I like it in your house, Mick... Pretty pictures of your kid, Hayley...
M	MICK	Fucken don't.
M	LOUIS	Don't what, don't say she's pretty? But I saw her, the other day at the club... At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick, His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	Okay. Okay I'm going. But-- And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	--first I think I should give you back your key. It isn't right that I have it. Now that we can trust each other. Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the
M	MICK	That's it, Hayley, get in her way! Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her,
M	MICK (CONT'D)	It's okay, honey! When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it--
M	MICK (CONT'D)	This is Haller... He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even
M	LANKFORD	Levin was back in his office...
F	SOBEL	We wouldn't have found him if a neighbor hadn't brought the dog back. It was running loose.
M	LANKFORD	Your name's all over this. Were you the only guy he worked for?
M	MICK	No, but I've got a big trial next month, attempted rape and murder. He was helping me.
F	SOBEL	Is that the Roulet case?
M	MICK	How did you know?
F	SOBEL	Because every file that's been rifled has the name.
M	LANKFORD	Only thing, Roulet himself is already cleared for this. We've checked the tracking on his tracer- anklet and it doesn't show him anywhere near this place. And there's no way to trick those things, no way in the world. We see Mick register this-- wants to ask about it, but before
M	LANKFORD (CONT'D)	By the way, Counsellor, where were you this morning? Mick rocked by the question. What it means.
M	MICK	I'm a suspect?
F	SOBEL	He knew whoever shot him. There are no signs of forcible, he even let the killer into the back room.
M	MICK	I was watching my daughter play soccer. A couple of dozen people can confirm I was there. Provisionally buying this, Lankford takes out booties.
M	LANKFORD	Put these on and don't touch anything back there.
F	SOBEL	Can you tell us if you see anything unusual? Mick draws close. Lankford, abruptly--
M	LANKFORD	All I see are pictures of a guy. Was he a fruit? He was a hell of an ex-cop, is what he was. Crimes Against Persons, back in Chicago. And yeah he was gay, and what the hell's that got to do with it? If the murder was some kind of gay thing, why'd they ransack the office? Isn't it obvious they were looking for something to do with his work? Lankford can't argue with this. When Sobel, near the body:
F	SOBEL	Look. The position of his hands.
M	LANKFORD	Was this guy a Longhorns fan or what? Or is it some kind of sign, like he was trying to tell us who --"The devil did it?"
M	VAL	Hey Mick! Val's surprised... a mix of emotions... What're you doin' here?... and I heard about Raul Levin, man...
M	MICK	You know your garage door's open?
M	VAL	Shit: I just had a plasma delivered... And rushes to... the GARAGE. Mick trails... Val's relieved to
M	VAL (CONT'D)	Oh man, if we still lived in Van Nuys this sucker'd be gone. Set me back eight grand, too. But it's gonna be great for the games... What's up anyway? What brings you out here?
M	MICK	Raul's murder. I've been with the cops. They can't tie Roulet to it, because your ankle bracelet doesn't put him near the house.
M	VAL	I know, I gave them the trace. The bracelet's got a mass detector, there's no way to beat that.
M	MICK	Did the cops ask you where you were this morning, Val? Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking...
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Somehow, some way, Louis killed Raul Levin. And it didn't show up on the trace. Mick looks at the plasma TV, then back at Val. Val reddens--
M	VAL	You better not be sayin' what I think-- that I cut him loose-- to let him kill Raul--?
M	MICK	Maybe you didn't know what he was going to do--
M	VAL	You think I'd let that happen? For a fuckin' TV? And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick
M	VAL (CONT'D)	Shit, man--
M	MICK	Where'd you get the money for an eight thousand dollar TV, Val?
M	VAL	That's bullshit! I didn't do that! How dare you say that to me-- I'm inocente, man-- Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at
M	VAL (CONT'D)	Get outa here; Get out of here, Mick, and get outa my life! Mick's already backing off-- towards the car--
M	VAL (CONT'D)	Keep going, man! Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys. Mick looks
M	BARTENDER	That's it. You're done here, pal. And you're not driving either. Call yourself a cab or something. Off Mick,
F	MAGGIE	Being married to you sucked but it beat being a car service...
M	MICK	That's the idea, y'know. Car service, with the Lincolns-- Drive the illustrious turds of our city back and forth to LAX--
F	MAGGIE	I'll be your first customer. First dollar. And rolls him onto the bed. He looks at her. Drunk as he is:
M	MICK	Lemme ask you something. Corliss. The name Corliss. You didn't just give me that just because you'd been drinking. You wanted me to have it. She doesn't confirm or deny. Just gets him into bed-- says
M	MAGGGIE	I'm not staying. He knows, but-- one thing more--
M	MICK	Maggie-- Raul. Did I get him killed? Moved, she shakes her head no. Straightens his pillow.
F	MAGGIE	How do you do it, Haller? You're a sleazy defense lawyer with two ex- wives and a daughter, and we all still love you. We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes. To no one:
M	MICK	I can't do this anymore.
M	MACHINE VOICE	Message received: YESTERDAY, ELEVEN-
M	RAUL'S VOICE	Mick, it's me. Guess I missed you. Wanted to go over a few things, so I wouldn't interrupt your day with Hayley. Anyway... Presses STOP. Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal. But First, that witness name you gave me. Corliss? Turns out he's this hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss, sometimes goes by "DJ." When you run it that way you find out he's played the courtroom snitch a lot, mostly in Arizona. But here's the thing: One time down there? It blew up on him. I'm working on it, it can be good for us... Don't know how we get to him, though. They put him in USC lock-up, just to make it harder... Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS... Other thing is, you asked me to dig deep-on Roulet? Mick, I found something. I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q. When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING... and a DOOR BELL... Uh, that's somebody at the door... Look, have a good time with your kid. Gotta go, boss. And MESSAGE goes OFF. Mick thinks a moment. Tries to clear Detective Sobel. It's me. Haller. Look, I-- just checked my phone messages. It turns out Raul called me. Just before he was killed. I didn't know. The message came at Eleven-oh- seven. He said, "I think I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q." Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a former client of yours--
M	MICK	In San Quentin. Right.
F	SOBEL	Did he say anything else? Looks down at his notes. At "Corliss." "USC." A beat. As he
M	MICK	No-- No, that's it. Then the dog barked, somebody was at the door. He hung up. Look, maybe you can tell me if there's any progress on the case. He was my friend. Sobel, makes a decision...
F	SOBEL	Well, we did catch a break. We found a bullet casing in the room, from a 22. It turns out Levin owned a .22, but when we checked it out it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun that killed him... To which, Mick reacts... as she goes on...
M	SOBEL (CONT'D)	The other thing is we can't find his cell-phone... Are you still there?
M	MICK	Yeah... just, I'll let you know if I think of anything. About his cell- phone, I mean. Thanks. And hangs up. Too sudden. Leaves Sobel wondering... With GLORIA. In prison jumper. Faint smile.
M	MICK	Gloria I'm not here about you. I'm here about me. I need your help.
M	LOUIS	Mick. I want to tell you something before we start.
M	MICK	Better make it fast.
M	LOUIS	You're my lawyer, right? So I can tell you anything, even a crime I've committed, and you have to keep it secret.
M	MICK	That's right. Unless it's one you're going to commit.
M	LOUIS	I've killed people, Mick. Reaction Mick. Just then, Courtroom clerk gives a warning--
M	COURTROOM CLERK	Two minutes, people... Now? Now? Why now, are you telling me this...
M	LOUIS	Because I know your plan. Mick looks at him. Before he can deny--
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	Your plan is to defend me on this-- then, when I'm not your client, throw me to the cops. I can't let that happen. So I'm telling you: I've killed people and guess what? Martha Renteria was one of them. There now. If you use what I've told you you might get Jesus Martinez out of jail, but you'll never practice law again. And I'll never be prosecuted. I think it's called fruits of the poisoned tree--
M	MICK	Come with me. Cuts Louis off, rises, leads him... past prosecution table,
M	MICK	You son of a bitch. You killed Raul.
M	LOUIS	You're right about one thing. I am a son of a bitch.
M	MICK	How did you do it? The trace said you weren't even in Glendale...
M	LOUIS	He was getting too close.
M	MICK	You piece of shit, do you think you have this wired? You don't!
M	LOUIS	I do have an insurance policy. He grabs Mick's wrists. Strong: pulls them off his chest.
M	MICK	I want my gun, Louis--
M	LOUIS	I walk away from this trial a free man-- and remain free-- and it never falls into wrong hands. The deal. Mick's close to hitting him-- when the door opens--
M	COURTROOM CLERK	Judge Fullbright is on the bench.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Nice of you to join us... She's 46, bad hair, tough. Mick's off on the wrong foot.
M	MICK	I'm sorry, your honor.
M	TED	What this case is about is a predator... On the night of March Sixth, Louis Roulet was out stalking his prey... Jury of twelve, two alternates...
M	TED (CONT'D)	You are going to hear from the victim herself about her lifestyle, one that we would not condone. But remember that anyone, anyone, can be the victim of a violent crime. The case is clear. Straightforward. A man attacked a woman in her home in order to rape and kill her. It is only by the grace of God that she's here to tell you the story. Over Ted, Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... My name's Michael Haller, and I'm representing Louis Roulet. Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the word prostitute for the woman who's supposed to be Louis's victim. He needn't worry, this case isn't about how she makes her money... But it is about her actions. How she saw a young man with signs of wealth, and chose to target him... What she didn't count on, was you. The fact that you'd put two and two together, and let your common sense tell you who was the real predator.
F	LORNA	You had a message from Gloria. She thinks she can do what you asked.
M	MICK	Thinks?
F	LORNA	Corliss has the same meal time. She can try. Let her try. But it may not matter.
F	LORNA	What do you mean?
M	MICK	I mean, Corliss isn't on the witness list. It could be Ted Minton is holding him back. He won't use him until he has to. Until I screw up his case so bad he has no choice.
F	LORNA	Mickey? Can you do that? Off Mick, tries for a confident smile...
M	FEMALE COP (MAXWELL)	I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got there as... hurt and frightened...
M	TED	Frightened?
M	OFFICER MAXWELL	She kept asking us if she was safe, even after Roulet was taken away.
M	MICK	Officer, would you read from your arrest report where it's marked?
M	OFFICER MAXWELL	"The victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked."
M	MICK	Why did you write that she didn't know him?
M	OFFICER MAXWELL	Because that's what she said.
M	MICK	So, she just opened the door at ten o'clock to a stranger?
M	OFFICER MAXWELL	She didn't put it like that...
M	MICK	Was there blood on his right hand?
M	OFFICER MAXWELL	No, his left. Or we would have bagged his right one, too.
M	TED	Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss Campo on the night of March Sixth? CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video. Blurred
M	TALBOT	Yep. Had a date with her at Morgan's. Then from there we went to her place and had another date, if you know what I mean.
M	B5.	Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored.
M	TED	Had you known Miss Campo before?
M	TALBOT	Nope. Just called her up.
M	TED	How did you know to call her?
M	TALBOT	From her website. She's got a real good website. Jury laughs a little. Fascinated but repulsed by this guy...
M	TED	Did you have sexual relations?
M	TALBOT	Four hundred bucks worth. And she earned every cent. Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval. Mick catches
M	TED	And what time did you leave?
M	TALBOT	About five minutes before ten.
M	TED	She say she had another engagement?
M	TALBOT	No, she acted like she was done for the night...
M	MICK	Objection, I don't think Mr. Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms. Campo's thinking or plans...
M	TALBOT	I just mean she acted satisfied... Sustained! Go on, Mr. Minton.
M	TED	When you left, what condition was she in? Was she hurt?
M	TALBOT	No, she was fit as a fiddle. I know because I'd just played her. Sorry, your honor. She was fine. Minton goes, lifts a sheet over an easel, REVEALS the blown-
M	TED	She didn't look like this?
M	TALBOT	Man. What kind of bastard does something like that?
M	FULLBRIGHT	Answer the question.
M	TALBOT	No. We made consensual and pleasurable love. Which is what life is all about. Then I paid her.
M	MICK	Mr. Talbot, are you right or left- handed?
M	TALBOT	Left.
M	MICK	Left. And isn't it true that before you left Regina Campo asked you to strike her repeatedly in the face? Your honor, there's no basis for this sort of questioning. Mr. Haller is just muddying the waters with outrageous statements. Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply. Mick half-shrugs...
M	MICK	Part of the defense theory, Judge.
M	FULLBRIGHT	The witness can answer.
M	TALBOT	I never hit her or any other woman.
M	MICK	Do you know a prostitute named... Shaquille Barton? "Shaquilla Shakels" is her work name.
M	TALBOT	Okay, yeah. I seen her one time...
M	MICK	And if I brought her here and she said you had struck her with your left hand...
M	TALBOT	She'd be lying. I tried Shaquilla, that rough stuff's not for me. I'm a missionary man.
M	MICK	With a strong left. Thank you. And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last,
M	MICK	This warrant is bullshit--
M	LANKFORD	Good enough to search your house. For a Woodsman registered to you.
F	SOBEL	We need to run ballistics on it. She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt:
M	SOBEL (CONT'D)	It would have been better if you'd told me that you had a Woodsman.
M	MICK	I don't anymore. It was stolen. The worst yet. Lankford laughs: "How convenient..."
M	LANKFORD	We got the history on the piece. Turns out it belonged to Mickey Cohen the gangster, in the forties.
M	MICK	I know. My father represented him. He got him off for using it in self- defense, so Cohen made him a present of it. Sobel, careful, opens it... It's empty. Like Mick said.
F	SOBEL	Why didn't you report it stolen?
M	MICK	Because I knew who took it. A client. He told me, so I couldn't turn him in without breaking a trust. They do that.
M	LANKFORD	Still and all, mind if I look around? Just in case you haven't had time to toss it off a pier?
M	MICK	Go crazy. You've got the warrant. Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel--
M	LANKFORD	Heidi-- bag the box. He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why.
M	MICK	You can't do ballistics on a box. She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains.
F	SOBEL	That old Mickey Cohen shooting? It's kind of famous. It turns out the county still has the evidence in storage. The bullet.
M	MICK	You can match casings to a slug that's fifty years old?
F	SOBEL	It'd be easier with the gun, but yeah. She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with--
M	MICK	Detective? How long will ballistics take?
F	SOBEL	Careful. You'll make me think you're worried what we'll find.
M	MICK	I'm in the middle of a trial.
F	SOBEL	A day. Maybe forty-eight hours. She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.
M	TED	Morning, Haller. Word is, you had interesting visitors last night...
M	MICK	Worry about yourself, Ted. You're dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you don't even know it. They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits Listen, you little shit: This gun- scheme of yours is about to blow up, and I'm not going down for it. If I have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life. Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled.
M	TED	One last witness, your honor. The prosecution calls Regina Campo.
F	REGGIE	It's true that I lied. I knew him when he came to the door.
M	TED	In fact, you'd arranged his coming Miss Campo: why did you lie?
F	REGGIE	I was scared. I wasn't sure the police would believe me and I wanted to make sure they arrested him... because he's an animal... She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she
M	TED	Do you regret that decision now?
F	REGGIE	Yes. If it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else.
M	MICK	Your honor, prejudicial--
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Sustained. But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done. Reggie's moved them.
M	TED	I have no further questions for Regina, your honor. Ted sits.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Your witness, Mr. Haller. Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand. Low-voiced----
M	LOUIS	I want to remind you of your words. You were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea.
M	MICK	That's it, keep acting like you pull the strings.
M	LOUIS	I do.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Mr. Haller. Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched
M	MICK	Ms. Campo have you engaged an attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the events of March Sixth?
F	REGGIE	No I haven't.
M	MICK	But have you talked to an attorney?
F	REGGIE	I haven't hired anybody or--
M	MICK	I asked if you talked to one. About a possible lawsuit. Mick's crisp like he knows for sure. She wilts a little.
F	REGGIE	It was nothing more than talk...
M	MICK	Did you ask if you could sue Mr. Roulet for damages?
F	REGGIE	I thought what you say to lawyers is private.
M	MICK	If you wish, you can tell the jurors. Faces her. Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in.
F	REGGIE	I think I want to keep it private. Ted squirms again. Wrong answer.
M	MICK	Okay, let's go back to the night at Morgan's. Had you ever seen Louis Roulet before that night?
F	REGGIE	Yes. There and other places.
M	MICK	Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch?
M	MICK	Or that he drove one of two cars, a Porsche or a Range Rover?
F	REGGIE	I never saw him driving.
M	MICK	And what made you approach him?
F	REGGIE	I knew he was in the life. You know. A player. I had seen him leave with girls who do what I do.
M	MICK	With prostitutes. To go to a hotel, or their apartments...?
F	REGGIE	I don't know where.
M	MICK	So how do you know they left? Maybe they just went out for a smoke...
F	REGGIE	Because they got in his car and drove away.
M	MICK	But you just testified that you never saw Mr. Roulet drive! Now you saw him leave with a prostitute like yourself. Which is it? The contradiction rings round the room. Reggie, tries...
F	REGGIE	I saw him get in a car but I didn't know what kind it was.
M	MICK	Do you know the difference between a Porsche and a Range Rover?
F	REGGIE	one's big and one's small, I guess. Reactions... Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making
M	MICK	The women he left with, when you saw them again, had they been beaten or injured?
F	REGGIE	I don't know, I didn't ask.
M	MICK	But girls in your profession talk about customers, don't you? Warn each other if someone's a freak...
F	REGGIE	Yeah, usually...
M	MICK	And how many had warned you about Louis Roulet?
F	REGGIE	None. No one.
M	MICK	So you believed you'd be safe?
F	REGGIE	I, thought he was a known quantity and I needed the money, so...
M	MICK	So you thought he could solve your need for money?
M	MICK	No? Isn't that why we're sitting here? Because you zeroed in on him?
F	REGGIE	No! I mean yes, but not like that-- He attacked me, I swear!
M	MICK	What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo?
F	REGGIE	My name and address...
M	MICK	And your price?
F	REGGIE	Yes. Four hundred dollars.
M	MICK	It's a hard line of work...
F	REGGIE	And dangerous.
M	MICK	In fact, haven't you told friends you were looking for a way out?
F	REGGIE	Yes. I'm not proud of what I do--
M	MICK	And so, isn't it true-- nothing would be easier to understand-- that you saw Louis Roulet and his money as a way out?
F	REGGIE	No! That's not what this is about! That man hit me and tried to kill me.
M	MICK	Yes, we've heard you say that-- Judge may I ask the witness to stand up?
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	The witness will stand. I hope you're going somewhere with this, Mr. Haller. Reggie stands.
M	MICK	Now if you please, walk over to my client. She goes, stands before Louis. Who rises on cue from Mick.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	This is the man you broke free from, overpowered, knocked out?
F	REGGIE	Yes-- You can do amazing things when you're afraid--
M	MICK	How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo? Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN- DOT-COM says one hundred three...
F	REGGIE	That's right. A beat. Louis sits. Reggie stands there... suddenly cries.
M	MICK	I've got no further questions for the witness, your honor. Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table. Where
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Mr. Minton? Do you have another witness for us? Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises...
M	LOUIS	He looks worried. Mick watching Ted, waits, tense...
M	TED	The state rests, your honor. Mick's disappointed: No Corliss.
M	MICK	Not worried enough.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch. And the gavel comes down.
M	MARY WINDSOR	Yes, I recognize this knife. It's the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years. Almost exactly.
M	MICK	Why would he need protection?
M	MARY WINDSOR	Because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt... Even raped or murdered.
M	MICK	But has Louis ever been the subject of such a crime?
M	MARY WINDSOR	No. But he knew someone who...
M	MICK	Go on, please.
M	MARY WINDSOR	She was raped and robbed by a man. Louis found her. It was terrible. The first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry, at all times. March Sixth would have been no different.
M	TED	Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty exact, about when your son started carrying around this, this weapon, a five-inch folding knife...
M	MARY WINDSOR	I am. The incident took place on June ninth, two-thousand-one. Mick watches Ted, carefully... Cat and mouse...
M	TED	Was it in the newspapers?
M	MARY WINDSOR	No.
M	TED	Or, do you somehow remember because the police came to talk to Louis...
M	MARY WINDSOR	There was no police investigation.
M	TED	Then how can you remember the exact date so well? Were you given the date before testifying here?
M	MARY WINDSOR	I know the date because I'll never forget the day I was attacked. The news falls on Ted. She goes on before he can rally... Louis will never forget it either. He found me in that house, tied up. Naked. It was traumatic for him. She's perfect: a strong woman, unused to showing emotion.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Mr. Minton-- anything else? Ted, still thrown, stares down at his notes.
M	TED	As Louis's mother, you'd do or say anything to save him, wouldn't you?
M	MARY WINDSOR	I wouldn't lie. Not about what happened that day...
M	TED	We have no police or hospital record that it even occurred...
M	MARY WINDSOR	I never reported it...
M	TED	Why not?
M	MARY WINDSOR	I was ashamed. If you don't understand that I can't explain it to you. And yet I live with it every day.
M	TED	But it's only you who says so: Mary looks at Ted, and at the Judge, as if confused:
M	MARY WINDSOR	Is that a question? Off Mick, admiring, GO TO,
M	TED	I've been thinking about the thousand razors.
M	MICK	We've had an offer. Want to spend six months in county jail?
M	LOUIS	I told you from the beginning--
M	MICK	I know: The only verdict's Not Guilty. Okay. We'll get there. Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm. But:
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Don't touch me, Louis. You want to show your gratitude give me my gun back. Louis grins: meaning No way.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	I thought so. You still sure you want me to put you on the stand?
M	LOUIS	I insist on it.
M	MICK	Then get some rest tonight, you're up next. Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the
M	MICK	There's something I need you to get me, Earl. A tone Earl never heard him use before. Earl turns around.
M	TED	Did you talk to your client?
M	MICK	Yes. No deal. Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance... While, TO THE JUDGE:
M	MICK (CONT'D)	The defense calls Louis Ross Roulet, your honor.
M	LOUIS	I turned toward the living room, the way she pointed... ANGLE MICK, has a floorplan of the apartment, on an easel.
M	MICK	And what happened when you turned?
M	LOUIS	Something hit me and I blacked out. I don't know for how long.
M	MICK	That was all?
M	LOUIS	Then when I woke up these guys were on me, telling me not to move. I couldn't anyway. I was too scared. Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws...
M	MICK	But, there was blood on your jacket and your left hand...
M	LOUIS	Someone put it there because I didn't.
M	MICK	Are you left-handed?
M	LOUIS	No.
M	MICK	You didn't strike Ms. Campo with your left fist?
M	LOUIS	No!
M	MICK	Threaten to rape her, or kill her?--
M	LOUIS	No!
M	MICK	You're angry. Why?
M	LOUIS	Do you know what it's like to be accused of something like this? To listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful? I, I understand I had to be quiet and wait my chance and not say anything-- but if guilty people have rights, what about innocent people? I am innocent! Mick. Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect.
M	MICK	Nothing further, Judge. Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat--
M	TED	According to you, Ms. Campo punched herself or had a man she never met before punch her lights out as part of a set-up?
M	LOUIS	All I know is that I didn't.
M	TED	And this knife you always carry, how did she know she'd find it on you as part of the set-up? She couldn't, could she? I mean, I never took it out or showed it to anybody-- so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money I had that I was going to pay her with, right?--
M	TED	I'd really prefer it if I ask the questions, and you answer them! Would you look at this, please-- Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Please tell us again if you think Regina Campo would or could have done this to herself.
M	LOUIS	I don't know who did it, but it wasn't me. Nobody deserves that to happen...
M	TED	What do you mean by "deserves?" Do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she "deserves?"
M	LOUIS	I mean no matter what she does for a living or who she is-- No woman deserves that. Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there.
M	TED	I have no more questions. At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION-- Louis gives Mick a "How'd I do?" look, Mick nods, As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling
M	MICK	Your honor, the defense rests. Ted hears this, sets his jaw. Fullbright turns to him.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Mr. Minton? Ted is uncertain...
M	TED	Your honor... The state needs the night to decide, your honor...
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	To decide what?
M	TED	Frankly I wasn't anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses. I-- I'd like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness.
M	MICK	Your honor, first we've heard of
M	TED	I said `-consider." I need to find out if the witness is even
M	MICK	The state still has an obligation to disclose the identity--
M	TED	Not if I decide not to use him. I'm begging the court's indulgence, your honor. Fulbright doesn't like it... but weighs, yields. Go to,
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	There's a rumor in the office...
M	MICK	How I'm the one who shot Raul?
F	MAGGIE	Haller, is this serious?
M	MICK	I'd say so. I'm being set up for his murder. Couple of detectives from Glendale are following me around, just waiting for the go- ahead to hit me with an arrest warrant... Could be any minute...
F	MAGGIE	How is this possible?
M	MICK	Bad timing, bad client, me being dumb...
F	MAGGIE	Is it Roulet? Is that the client?
M	MICK	I can't talk to you about my clients. How is Hayley?
F	MAGGIE	Fine. But Haller, if she ever hears anything about this--
M	MICK	She won't. Not if I play it right.
F	MAGGIE	What are you going to do? A long beat. Then he says, just as he told Raul--
M	MICK	I'm working on it. I have a plan.
M	EARL	.when Not Guilty Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs... Scene we saw at the opening. Mick absorbed... Earl notices...
M	EARL (CONT'D)	You gettin' any of this, Mr. Haller? Mick opens the file (back-seat office extraordinarily neat).
M	MICK	Bill, I'm getting coffee. Any for you?
M	CLERK BILL	No man, I'm off caffeine...
M	MICK	Hey, is that the custody list? Can I see if any of my no-good clients are on it? Bill lets him have it. Mick, casual, looks over the names...
M	MICK	Minton's putting on Corliss. He's got him in lock-up already...
F	LORNA	But Gloria still hasn't let us know if she got to him!
M	MICK	You said she had mealtimes to work it...
F	LORNA	Yes but...
M	MICK	I'll take my chances. Meantime did you serve Kurlen? Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed & fast--
F	LORNA	Yes but I didn't like forging the judge's signature...
M	MICK	Yes you did.
F	LORNA	Yes I did. Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they
M	MICK	Now go, and be ready for my call. Lorna starts to go-- then pauses.
F	LORNA	I'm crazy about the power suit. Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching.
M	KURLEN	What shit is this, Haller? I got nothing to do with your case! Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers. With surprise--
M	MICK	Subpoena to appear as a witness? You'll just have to wait and see. It's a legal document, Detective. Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.)	Mr. Minton--
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Does the state have any rebuttal?
M	TED	The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness.
M	MICK	Judge? Who is this witness? Why wasn't I told before now?
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	A fair question. Mr. Minton?
M	TED	Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody, following his arrest.
M	LOUIS	Bullshit! I didn't to talk to--
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller, control your client! Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce--
M	MICK	That was good. Now leave it to me. I do share my client's outrage, your honor. I'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony...
M	TED	Mr. Corliss did not come forward until yesterday. This is incredible...
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Do you want to go back and talk to him? Given the timing I'd allow it.
M	MICK	No, Judge, we all know what this is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and anything he'd say would be a lie--
M	TED	That's groundless, your honor--
M	MICK	--I just want my objection noted.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Then I'm going to rule he can
M	MICK	Can I ask one indulgence? Can I step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator? For whatever good it will do at this late date.
M	LORNA'S VOICE	Yep, here.
M	MICK	Put your watch at quarter of. At ten fifteen you enter the room.
M	LORNA'S VOICE	Got it.
M	MICK	With the printouts.
M	LORNA'S VOICE	Mickey, I know the moves! He snaps shut his cell-phone.
M	TED	Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated at this time?
M	CORLISS	Um, no, now I'm just in the courtroom. Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething...
M	TED	But you are currently held in the jail-ward at USC hospital?
M	CORLISS	Yes. Since I got arrested.
M	TED	For burglary and drug possession?
M	CORLISS	That's right.
M	TED	Now. Do you know the defendant?
M	CORLISS	Yes. I met him in lock-up. We was bussed over from jail, and then we was together in the tank when we came for first appearance.
M	TED	And did you talk at that time?
M	CORLISS	Yes... we talked about how bad we needed cigarettes.
M	TED	Anything else?
M	CORLISS	You know, "what are you in for?" Like that.
M	TED	Did he say what he was "in for?"
M	CORLISS	He said, "For giving a bitch exactly what she deserved." Those were his words. Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal. Mick steadies...
M	TED	I have only one more question. Have I, or has anyone, made you promises to get you to testify? No. It's the right thing to do. Ted sits. Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily.
M	MICK	How many times have you been arrested, Mr. Corliss?
M	CORLISS	About seven in L.A. Couple of times in Phoenix if you count those.
M	MICK	So you know how the system works?
M	CORLISS	I try to survive...
M	MICK	And sometimes that means ratting out fellow inmates, is that it?
M	TED	Objection, your honor...
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Take a seat, Mr. Minton. I gave you leeway bringing this witness in.
M	MICK	Thank you, your honor. But I'll rephrase: How many times have you snitched on an inmate? Testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution?
M	CORLISS	This makes my fourth. Four times? People just come up and tell you they committed crimes so you can testify against them--
M	CORLISS	People talk to me. I'm a friendly guy. Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him--
M	MICK	So you and my client were friends--
M	CORLISS	That's right, we was friendly--
M	MICK	And he just said what you said he said, about what the woman "deserved," and then you went back to talking about cigarettes?
M	CORLISS	Not exactly. He was like, bragging. He told me he did it before... Mick freezes... Like he's in a mine field and can't move...
M	CORLISS (CONT'D)	He said the other time he killed the bitch... He got away with it then and he would get away with it now.
M	MICK	You... Wait... All eyes on Mick. The Judge prompts...
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Mr. Haller?
M	MICK	No more questions, your honor.
M	TED	Re-direct, your honor. Fullbright nods permission. While Louis leans over to Mick...
M	LOUIS	What the hell is this?
M	MICK	You tell me! What did you say to this guy?
M	LOUIS	Nothing! This is a set-up! You're doing this!
M	MICK	How? How am I doing this? But Louis has no answer. Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor...
M	TED	You said he was bragging. How?
M	CORLISS	Well, like, he told me the details. About the other one, that he killed.
M	CORLISS (CONT'D)	He called her a snake dancer. She danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit. ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this...
M	MICK	How does he know this?
M	LOUIS	Do you think I know?
M	MICK	If you didn't tell him this shit somebody did. Who? Start thinking! RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss--
M	TED	Is there anything else he told you?
M	CORLISS	No, that snake-girl stuff was it.
M	TED	Then no further questions, your honor. Ted sits. The look he gives Mick in passing is one of
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Any re-cross from the defense? Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see
M	MICK	A moment with my staff, Judge?
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Be quick. He meets Lorna at the gate. Brings his head close to hers--
F	LORNA	This is where I whisper in your ear, tell you stuff...
M	MICK	It's all here, right? You go now, I don't want anyone talking to you.
F	LORNA	Damn. She goes, he returns to the table. Before Louis can speak:
M	MICK	I don't know what's going on here, but it won't matter if it's two murders or a hundred if I can show he's a liar--
M	LOUIS	If you set me up I swear I'll--
M	MICK	Just tell me if there's anything else he knows. Anything else I have to stay away from.
M	LOUIS	I don't know because I never talked to him. I'm not that stupid.
M	MICK	It doesn't matter. If I destroy him none of it counts...
M	LOUIS	Then destroy him. A command. Mick nods. Returns to the witness Corliss--
M	MICK	Dwayne, if I can call you that--
M	CORLISS	It's what people call me--
M	MICK	Don't they also call you D.J.? For example, down in Phoenix, right?
M	CORLISS	Maybe. He's a bit wary. Mick looks through the file Lorna brought--
M	MICK	Because you know, my assistant, she was just reading on the internet about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges-- Hometown of Mesa, Arizona?
M	CORLISS	Yeah, that'd be me. But--
M	MICK	You remember Fred Bentley, right? Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick--
M	TED	I object, your honor, where is the defense going with this?
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller. But the witness can answer.
M	CORLISS	I don't remember any Bentley--
M	MICK	Sure you do. You testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with-- rape of a ten-year- old girl-- even though he denied his guilt in court. Am .I ringing any bells, D.J.?
M	CORLISS	Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot, there's not much I recall--
M	MICK	Then I'd like you to read this to us, D.J. It's a printout of a news story from the Arizona Star, 1997, that's eight years after he was convicted. I ask that it be admitted into evidence--
M	TED	Your honor? A news report?
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Let's see where it takes us. The state can object later. Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss.
M	MICK	I've marked the paragraph.
M	CORLISS	I ain't too good at reading... "A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly convicted of rape, was released Saturday after con-- --conclusive DNA results cleared him of the crime. The case was bolstered at trial by testimony from an informant, D.J. Corliss of Mesa, who claimed Bentley had-- bragged to him about the rape while together in a holding cell--"
M	MICK	That's enough. Were you charged with perjury for that incident, D.J.?
M	CORLISS	No I was not.
M	MICK	Was that because the police were complicit in your confession?
M	TED	Judge, how can the witness know what went into the D.A.'s decision?
M	MICK	Were you promised the same deal here, Mr. Corliss? To say that Louis Roulet "bragged" to you in the "holding cell?"
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Alright, Mr. Haller, that will do!
M	MICK	Sorry. I have no more questions. And Mick sits. Courtroom's hushed. Until--
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	I'm excusing the jury for an early lunch. Bailiff, see them out. Maintains a smile as the jurors leave. Then her smile dies.
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	Mr. Minton do you know what you have done? You've put a documented liar on the stand, a man with a record of putting innocent people
M	TED	Your honor, I--
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	You shut the fuck up when I'm talking to you! I can think of nothing more prejudicial or corrupt than what I just saw out therel Do you realize what you've done to my trial?
M	MICK	He's going to see his boss. To decide what to do before the judge comes down with a directed verdict.
M	LOUIS	What's a directed verdict?
M	MICK	She takes it out of the jury's hand and declares an acquittal. Oh my god...
M	MICK	We'll know in a few minutes. And heads off. Louis's cold stare, watches him go...
M	LOUIS	I'm not celebrating just yet, Mick.
M	MICK	Yeah I can see that.
M	LOUIS	I want to know how Corliss got that shit he was saying.
M	MICK	Let it go. You're getting what you want, I'm getting you off...
M	LOUIS	What I want is get off for good. Leans into him. Pushes a hand into his back. A threat.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	You'd better understand that. You've got enough reasons to be afraid of me already. When-- DOOR OPENS-- the courtroom CLERK, BILL, enters.
M	CLERK BILL	It's starting.
M	TED	I just spoke to the District Attorney, your honor. The state wishes to dismiss all charges. Here's a motion... Mick, Louis, watch Ted hand it to Fullbright... It acknowledges that the procedures which guarantee justice were not followed in this case...
M	JUDGE FULLBRIGHT	This is a motion to dismiss with prejudice. No coming back. Ever. Yes, your honor.
M	MARY WINDSOR	Mr. Haller, thank you for my son...
M	DOBBS	You were splendid-- And Louis. Private, a few feet away. Smiles...
M	LOUIS	I knew I wasn't wrong about you...
M	MICK	I want the gun.
M	LOUIS	Of course you do. No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick--
M	MARY WINDSOR	Mr. Haller, this time I insist you come to Orso for a celebration--
M	MICK	I don't think so. Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR
M	KURLEN	Louis Roulet, you are under arrest. Turn around and place your hands behind your back.
M	LOUIS	Mick? This shouldn't be happening. Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back--
M	MARY WINDSOR	No! Take your hands off my son!
M	LOUIS	Mother. Louis' voice controls her. Stricken, Mary gives up. Then--
M	DOBBS	What are you arresting him for?
M	KURLEN	Suspicion of murder. The murder of Martha Renteria.
M	DOBBS	That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you crazy? Everything that man Corliss said was a lie! Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed.
M	KURLEN	If it was all lies, how'd you know I meant the snake dancer? Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis--
M	MICK	A moment with my client, Detective?
M	MICK (CONT'D)	This is it, Louis. I got you off. Now get yourself a new lawyer.
M	LOUIS	You're forgetting I have the gun...
M	MICK	Yeah, and you'll have to explain how you got it. But you know what? I've stopped giving a shit. You're going down, and Martinez is getting out, and that's all I care about.
M	MICK (CONT'D)	When they stick that needle in your arm, that will be me.
M	LOUIS	And what if I don't go down? But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists...
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	Because I don't think they have enough to hold me. I could be out by tomorrow... You've got women, you've got a daughter... At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily...
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	You can't protect everybody. Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow...
M	MICK	Please tell me you've got enough on Louis for the murder of Renteria.
F	SOBEL	We will. We have the ticket.
M	MICK	What ticket?
F	SOBEL	The parking ticket, that Raul found. That was the phone message he left you... Raul checked. Louis got one at a meter outside the victim's place, same time she was murdered.
M	MICK	What about Raul's murder? Do you have him for that?
F	SOBEL	No. We still don't know how he could have slipped the tracer anklet. Haller? Leave it alone. He hesitates-- but goes. Into the rain. Gets into--
M	EARL	Mr. Haller? Got that thing you asked for. And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel: A GUN. Mick,
M	MICK	I said I'd never do this. Ask you to violate your parole.
M	EARL	It's called, lookin' out for your blood. Mick sits back. Earl pops in a RAP CD, TUPAC.
M	TUPAC	"To be a man in this wicked land..." Mick's seen on the porch. PHONE RINGS, he rushes into answer.
M	MICK	Yeah?
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	Mick, it's Maggie...
M	MICK	Uh-huh, I've been waiting for this. You're calling to congratulate me.
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	No, listen to me: Roulet is out! What? They've had him half a dayl
F	MAGGIE	I know... but the D.A. downtown said the detectives didn't have enough, they had to kick him...
M	MICK	I knew it, they jumped the gun... dammit...
F	MAGGIE	They've still got the parking ticket... and they're working forensics on the knife...
M	MICK	Maggie... Look... There's more to this. Louis knows about Hayley.
F	MAGGIE	What are you saying? How could you expose her to--
M	MICK	I've got her picture in the house! He saw itl Where is she now?
F	MAGGIE	On the schoolbus-- the sitter's on the way to pick her up on Ventura, near the house--
M	MICK	Get her on the cell and tell her not to take Hayley home, keep her with her til you get there! How long will it take you?
M	MICK	Call me when you've reached the sitter. He hangs up. Thinking-- then dials a number--
M	VAL	Valenzeula.
M	MICK	Val it's me. Mickey Haller.
M	VAL	I should hang up on you. The shit you talked to me!
M	MICK	Don't hang up, Val! I need a favor--
M	VAL	You got balls even askin'--
M	MICK	--it's my family, Val. Maggie, Hayley-- they're in danger. This is Roulet, right?
M	MICK	Does he still have the ankle- bracelet on him?
M	VAL	Yeah, he must, he didn't come by the office and I'm the only one can take it off...
M	MICK	Then turn on the trace, Val. Now!
M	VAL	I got him...
M	MICK	Where is he?
M	VAL	He's movin'... on Sunset...
M	MICK	Is he coming to my house? Could be, yeah, he's going west, heading up Laurel Canyon... Mick, nods... glance toward his gun... Then... PHONE BEEPS in
M	MICK	Stay there, Val-- Maggie?
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	I reached the sitter, she'll keep Hayley at the bus-stop...
M	MICK	Good. As soon as you've got her, take her somewhere safe. And call me. Where is he, Val?
M	VAL	I see him but I don't know where he's goin'...
M	MICK	What?
M	VAL	He's not goin' to your house. Sonofabitch sailed right past the turn... SCREEN, CURSOR travelling...
M	MICK	So where's he going?
M	VAL	He's heading for the Valley.
M	MICK	Fuck, he's going to Maggie's. Keep track of him. Hangs up again. Looks around-- as if looking for an idea--
M	MICK (CONT'D)	Eddie? Eddie Vogel? It's Mick Haller...
M	MICK	Yes?
M	VAL'S VOICE	Mick, it's me...
M	VAL	Where's Maggie live? What street?
M	VAL	He's almost there, Mick.
M	MICK	Maggie be there, Maggie pick up... Hello...
M	MICK	Maggie!
M	MAGGIE'S VOICE	You've reached the cell-phone of Maggie McPherson... Slams down the phone... Desperate, grabs his jacket, his gun, OPENS it-- and MARY WINDSOR stands there. Before he speaks--
M	MARY WINDSOR	You took my son away from me! She raises her gun again-- Mick FIRES AT HER FROM INSIDE THE He watches, through the haze of his condition, as Mary Off Louis, his confusion and dawning fear... Cut to, Then rouses more as he HEARS feet come up the front steps...
M	MICK	They're down! I'm shot! Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford
F	SOBEL	Don't move, Haller-- She rushes to him. Lankford's already on his phone--
M	LANKFORD	This is Lankford, we've got a shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off Laurel, we need paramedics, ambulance transport for two-- During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises--
M	LANKFORD (CONT'D)	Transport for one. Rings off. Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--
F	SOBEL	Press hard and keep pressing. Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...
M	LANKFORD	Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell them it's over, they can grab Roulet and bring him in... He what? So, bring him to the Emergency Room first, then bring him in! Dig this. The uniforms had some help picking up Roulet. Some motorcycle gang was already beating the shit out of him.
M	MICK	The police were tailing him?
F	SOBEL	We thought he'd come after you. We couldn't tell you. The truth is we had plenty on him for killing Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be released. But we wanted Roulet for Levin, too. I told you: We had to find out how he beat the trace. Now we know. It was almost perfect. He's still wearing the anklet...
M	MICK	I know...
F	SOBEL	And it puts him half a city away. Just like last time. They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--
M	LANKFORD	Look at this. Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove,
M	LANKFORD (CONT'D)	They don't make'm like this anymore. Mick, makes a shape with his free hand. The "Longhorns" sign:
M	MICK	"W." Mrs. Windsor. Which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking.
F	MAGGIE	I didn't know you were awake. He looks at her. Questioning.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Don't worry, we haven't been living here. We did, for a while. When you were touch and go. Mick. Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	I'd better get her down, she can get hurt up there--
M	MICK	You can get hurt anywhere. Let her climb.
M	MICK	Keep your speed up, Earl... He's IN THE BACK-SEAT, IT'S A MESS... He's scribbling on This is Haller.
