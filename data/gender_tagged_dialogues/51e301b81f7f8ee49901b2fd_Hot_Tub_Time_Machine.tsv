M	LILY (O.S.)	Ready for the wildest bachelor party of all time? LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy
F	ADAM	You know it. I'm gonna bang all sorts of chicks this weekend!
M	LILY	That's not the answer I was looking for.
F	ADAM	Sorry, honey. Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss.
M	LILY	Look what I found... A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT
F	ADAM	Check out that young stud. Can you believe he's about to get married? Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17) Adam snatches the last photo from her.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Ignore that one. Nothing happened. I love you. Lily laughs.
M	LILY	Adam, you didn't know me yet. As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of
M	LILY (CONT'D)	Who's this? Lily shows Adam a PHOTO: -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers).
F	ADAM	I'm not sure.
M	LILY	Really? Lily shows Adam another PHOTO: -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks
F	ADAM	Oh! Jennie.
M	LILY	Who's Jennie?
F	ADAM	She's nobody. Ski instructor. You didn't know me yet. Lily still looks at him a little hard.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and a face. Of course I'm gonna take her picture. Lily still looks a little bothered.
M	LILY	Do you still think of her?
F	ADAM	Of course not! I think of you. As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:
M	LILY	Hold on... Lily goes into the CLOSET.
F	ADAM	Sweetie? She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	How did you know where I hid my... treasure? Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it
M	LILY	Explain this. From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure: -- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.
F	ADAM	OK! You caught me! I occasionally... reminisce... about Jennie O'Keefe!
M	LILY	That's gross. What's "occasionally?"
F	ADAM	About two hours ago when you were on the phone with your mother.
M	LILY	Jesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to let you go to your bachelor party and not be a basket case?
F	ADAM	What are you so worried about?
M	LILY	I'm worried that you're still thinking about this girl.
F	ADAM	Baby, the girl in that picture was nothing more than a crush. I could never get her and there's no possibility I'll ever be with her. She was a total stranger. Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.
M	LILY	So... you're into strangers?
F	ADAM	Well not the creepy "your mom was in an accident, now come with me" kind. But yeah, the hot lady in the supermarket kind of stranger. You have to admit - it's kinda hot.
M	LILY	So you're saying if you and I didn't know each other, it would be pretty hot if we fooled around?
F	ADAM	You kidding me? It would be fucking incredible. Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it. Wait a minute. Are you suggesting... yes. YES! Adam excitedly heads for the door.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	OK, I'll go down the hall. You get into character. This fucking rules. Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT, talking sexy
M	LILY	Oh I'm all alone in this big house. Cheerleading camp just ended and I need to get out of these sweaty clothes... Love where you're going with this, baby! Keep it up! She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.
M	LILY	Mmmm. My panties are so tight against my firm naked body...
M	ADAM (O.S.)	You should probably take them off!
M	LILY	Are you gonna let me do this?
M	ADAM (O.S.)	Sorry! Continue! You were just about to take off your panties! She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away. Now
M	LILY	It feels so good to be so naked. I hope no one can see me... Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s, handsome, J Crew) saunters
M	BLACK MAN	OK, so this asshole in front of me at the donut place is -- WHOA! Lily covers up and SCREAMS.
M	LILY	Get out of here!! He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.
M	BLACK MAN	Fuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean it up. That's gonna stain, though.
M	LILY	Just leave! He heads for the door, just as: Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.
F	ADAM	Special delivery for -- Jesus Christ! The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his Just tell me when I'm in the clear.
M	LILY	I can't wait for you to come back and marry me. Wow, that's crazy. Adam looks almost like it just hit him.
F	ADAM	Yeah. Wow.
M	LILY	Tell me again I have nothing to worry about.
F	ADAM	Babe, look at Nick... In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	You think with him in charge, we're gonna get into any kind of trouble? We'll probably eat too much pizza and I'll twist my ankle getting off the ski lift.
M	LILY	OK. Have an awesome bachelor party. Not too awesome. I got you something. Adam looks in the bag.
F	ADAM	Sandwich. Thanks. He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting
M	LILY	Let me see your phone. He takes it out.
F	ADAM	I told you, I'll call you when-- She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as
M	LILY	Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna be one of those women who wants an update every ten minutes. Even though I do want an update every ten minutes. Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.
M	LILY (CONT'D)	Just make sure whatever happens, you're back for the rehearsal dinner. I totally trust you.
F	ADAM	You should. I'm a lame-o.
M	LILY	Well at least you're a cute lame-o. Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a
M	NICK	I'm more than willing to forget about earlier, but this shit's going on Facebook.
M	NICK	I have no idea what Facebook is. My phone has a button that says Send To Facebook. I've been sending shit there for months. Adam looks out the window, smiling.
F	ADAM	I'm so psyched about this weekend!
M	NICK	Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you make up for all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member of society.
F	ADAM	You're a good friend. I'm sorry for putting my career and self sufficiency above bowling night.
M	NICK	This trip represents everything awesome about being a dude. We're gonna drink too much, eat whatever we want... I might not even change my socks.
F	ADAM	Live the dream.
M	NICK	Best of all, we don't have to answer to anyone. Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in
M	NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	Hi honey.
M	COURTNEY (V.0.)	Three goddamn bags of pretzels?
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	I'm with Adam, honey.
M	COURTNEY (V.0.)	Hi Adam. Nick, what have I told you about buying snacks that aren't on sale?
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	You said not to do it. And what did you do?
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	I bought three bags of pretzels. But I'm gonna eat them...
M	COURTNEY (V.0.)	That's not the point. Don't do it again. Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance.
M	COURTNEY (V.0.)	Call me from the road. Adam, say hi to Lily. OK, I sure wi-- CLICK. For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Don't her parents own the supermarket?
M	NICK	The whole damn chain. Just be thankful Lily doesn't have any family money. Nothing makes your dick softer.
F	ADAM	This looks like a place where people die. Mostly from murder. A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Lou!
M	LOU	Yes, I'm living in a transient motel. Let's get that purple elephant out of the room.
F	ADAM	Dude, it looks nice.
M	LOU	Thank you. I hate your guts.
F	ADAM	What'd you bring?
M	LOU	All my belongings.
M	NICK	So you're sorta like a bum now, huh?
M	LOU	In a sense.
M	LOU	Our system is fucked, gentlemen. You tell me how a whore wife can fuck some black dude - no offense - and still take her cuckold of a husband for all he's got.
M	NICK	Why would I take offense to that?
M	LOU	It's offensive.
M	NICK	Because he's black?
M	LOU	And because he's fucking my wife. And because you're black. And because of all the oversensitive horrible garbage... you know what? Forget no offense. Just offense. Are you offended?
M	NICK	Not really.
M	LOU	Then shut the fuck up.
F	ADAM	She's got a hell of an attorney.
M	LOU	Yes and thank you so very much for giving her the referral.
F	ADAM	She told me it was for a friend.
M	NICK	So... what? Your wife likes black dick now?
M	LOU	I'm gonna slaughter you in your sleep tonight.
F	ADAM	Thanks for coming, man.
M	LOU	Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming? Boo! Drive away before he gets in the car!
F	ADAM	Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a douche, but I'm trying to be closer to him since Mom died. Jacob gets in the back next to Lou. Hey buddy! How's it going? Good to see you!
M	JACOB	You look dirty and you smell bad.
M	LOU	You look gay and you smell like a basket of fancy soaps. Advantage me.
M	JACOB	How is that to your advantage?
F	ADAM	He's not gay. He's just... what are you again?
M	JACOB	Metrosexual.
M	LOU	You have sex with trains?
M	JACOB	For your information, I fuck chicks. Hot ones.
M	LOU	For your information, you fuck dudes. Gay ones.
M	JACOB	Yeah, well at least I'm young and my life's full of potential. I hear you're homeless now?
M	LOU	You told him?! I hate all you people.
F	ADAM	Will you two please shake hands and make up? We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone.
M	JACOB	Yeah, about that. Why aren't we going to Aspen? Vermont's lame.
F	ADAM	It's gonna be fun.
M	JACOB	Yeah, whatever. And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments,
M	LOU	I've gotta take a shit.
M	LOU	That was an ugly experience.
M	NICK	I don't wanna hear about it.
M	LOU	In a few years, when I'm dying of an exotic disease that causes my penis to bleed until it falls off, someone remember to tell the hospital to check out the filthy crapper at the Albany Rest Stop. It's the AIDS monkey of toilets. The guys put down their sandwiches.
F	ADAM	Thank you.
M	LOU	I don't know how you're doing it, man. I mean, Laurie's hot, don't get me wrong. Lily.
M	LOU	Right. Lily. But one vagina? Forever?
F	ADAM	That's the sacrifice. Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.
M	JACOB	And you're OK with that? I don't know your sexual history, but you sure you got it out of your system?
F	ADAM	I did OK for myself.
M	LOU	He didn't do that well for himself.
M	NICK	Yeah, isn't Lily your fourth?
F	ADAM	Fifth. Thank you.
M	JACOB	So you're averaging like one girl every eight years.
F	ADAM	Assuming I got laid when I was zero.
M	LOU	That would be awesome. Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.
F	ADAM	I'm fine. Maybe some cold feet, but that's normal. Thank you everyone for your concern.
M	JACOB	Just looking out for you. That's what brothers do, right? They look out for each other?
F	ADAM	Is this about something else?
M	JACOB	Forget it.
F	ADAM	No, let's do this. I'm sorry I wasn't around when you were growing up, OK? I was in college. And then I was working. Dad left. Someone had to take responsibility.
M	LOU	Boooooring! Shut up.
M	JACOB	I said forget it.
M	NICK	Guys, come on. Let's move past it. This is gonna be a fun weekend.
M	JACOB	I still say Vermont sucks.
M	LOU	You're confusing Vermont with yourself. This weekend is going to be incredible and you will not ruin it for me.
F	ADAM	You might like it. Havenhurst is pretty awesome. Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.
M	LOU	Fuck yeah it is! We're gonna ski the trail and bone some tail! You'll have to bone some of that tail for me, man.
M	LOU	Fuck that. You'll bone your own.
F	ADAM	No I won't.
M	LOU	Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of my life - not fucking a whore at my bachelor party.
M	NICK	That's the biggest mistake of your life?
M	LOU	Fuck yeah. And he's not making that same mistake.
F	ADAM	Uh... I'm not having sex with anyone this weekend. Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.
M	LOU	Ohhhh. I gotcha. You're not having sex this weekend.
F	ADAM	I'm not having sex this weekend. Without the winking. Right. No winking. I understand.
F	ADAM	I'm pretty sure you don't.
M	NICK	Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.
F	ADAM	Yes!
M	JACOB	so this is the coolest town ever?
F	ADAM	Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF Chang's. Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah
M	LOU	I don't even have the heart to tell you what I just fucking saw. But say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This town sucks.
M	NICK	What the fuck is going on? The car climbs a twisty part of the road.
M	NICK (CONT'D)	Please god let it still be there...
M	JACOB	What?
F	ADAM	Pink Paradise. Best strip club ever. The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The
M	NICK	Yes! It lives! The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into
M	LOU	I wanna die. Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here. TODDLERS and ELDERLY PEOPLE lounge and cry and nap. What have you done to us?
F	ADAM	I'm not playing drinking games with my grandma.
M	NICK	OK so the place skews a little older. Let's check in. We're not spending our time inside anyway. Hey buddy. I'm not gonna tell you again. I fuckin' got it. Adam backs off.
M	LOU	This guy's a dick.
M	LOU	No, fuck that. He's a dick. Oooh tough guy. He's gotta be Mister America.
M	JACOB	Captain America.
M	LOU	Go fuck yourself. Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then:
M	PHIL	I'm ready to be tipped. You, sir, have no tact. Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall,
M	NICK	Gentlemen... in this room lies the beginning of our awesome weekend.
M	JACOB	Or a continuation of everything that's sucked so far.
M	LOU	Yeah, I bet it's gonna be lame as shit in there. The furniture probably smells like mold.
M	JACOB	I say we go to Foxwoods.
M	LOU	I actually kinda like that idea.
F	ADAM	Guys! Everyone looks at Adam. Let's give it a chance. We don't know for sure that the room sucks. Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the door: OK, so now we know. The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of
M	JACOB	What the hell is with this place?
M	LOU	It's like a Stephen King novel, except not as cool.
M	NICK	We'll feel a lot better once we hit the slopes. Plus, I know there's one thing to look forward to. Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized.
M	LOU	Thank. God.
F	ADAM	At least some things never change.
M	JACOB	What's the big deal about a hot tub?
F	ADAM	Shame on you.
M	NICK	There's plenty of time for tubbin'. Let's ski.
M	JACOB	When's the last time you guys actually went skiing?
F	ADAM	It's been a few years.
M	NICK	I think we look good.
M	JACOB	Then you're an idiot.
M	NICK	All right, we race down the mountain. Loser buys first round. Premium shit only.
M	JACOB	You gonna be all right?
M	NICK	What does that mean?
M	JACOB	I dunno - do black dudes ski?
M	NICK	Of course black dudes ski. Aren't I wearing skis?
M	JACOB	I'm just not sure you're representative.
M	NICK	You're calling me an Uncle Tom?
M	JACOB	I don't even know what that means.
M	NICK	It means black dudes ski. Catch ya at the bottom. Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a
M	LOU	Black dudes don't ski. How's the bottom?
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	No, the black ones... without the pleats... Because the pleats make me look fat... No, I put it on the Amex... Because I'm the best man... I know, but I'm organizing... I'm gonna get cash fr-- I'm gonna get-- I'm gonna collect cash from the guys... Yes... Yes... Yes. I love you too. Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been Dude... OK, who's ready to sink their teeth into a delicious dinner?
M	AIDEN	You fellas look like you can handle some spice. I'm gonna knock it up a bit... throw some chili sauce in there... oh yeah, there it is. This is gonna knock your socks off. Nick's expression looks like he wants to kill the guy.
M	NICK	Thank you. The waiter walks away and Nick RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.
M	NICK (CONT'D)	I'd like to propose a toast. To my best friend, Adam. He may be throwing his life away, but at least he's throwing it away with a hot chick at his side. The guys LAUGH and clink glasses.
M	NICK (CONT'D)	And so what if you only have one vagina for the rest of your life. Speaking as someone who's seen your wife's vagina -- it's definitely one of the good ones. Lou and Jacob look confused, but clink glasses anyway, as Jacob raises his glass.
M	JACOB	To my brother, I say thank you for including me. I promise to try to make the most of it. The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness.
F	ADAM	Thanks for coming, man. It means a lot to me. Jacob nods halfheartedly.
M	NICK	To Adam!
M	GUYS	To Adam! The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly CHATTER. Just
M	MANAGER	Gentlemen. You're going to have to keep it down.
M	NICK	Come on, man. It's our friend's bachelor party. We're just trying to roast him a little bit.
M	MANAGER	Well if you like roasts, I suggest the roast peking duck. It's out of this world and as I'm sure Aiden has told you, he can make it quite spicy. The guys look bothered.
M	MANAGER (CONT'D)	But as for the noisy kind of roast, that's going to have to stop. We have many other guests trying to enjoy the P.F. Chang's experience. The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys are quiet.
M	LOU	This kung pau chicken pairs very nicely with the 97 cab. Very impressive choice, Nick.
M	NICK	Thank you.
M	LOU	Also, this is the worst bachelor party I've ever been to. Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.
M	JACOB	Totally agree.
F	ADAM	Nick, look. You had great intentions. No one's blaming you.
M	LOU	I'm blaming him.
M	JACOB	I'm totally blaming him. I didn't even want to go skiing.
M	NICK	OK I'll admit this trip is not off to the best start. But we're due for a victory! Nick thinks and actually gets an idea. He SNAPS his fingers.
M	NICK (CONT'D)	Hot tub! A lightbulb goes off for Adam too.
F	ADAM	Yes! Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.
M	LOU	Why did we even bother with dinner? Adam and Nick get up too.
M	JACOB	Guys, I'm still hungry.
M	LOU	Quiet, men are talking. Aiden approaches.
M	AIDEN	Get you guys some to-go boxes?
M	LOU	I would like you to die. And then I would like you to leave. Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	It's tub time. Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.
M	LOU	Oh my god. The water is perfect. He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK. Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink.
M	JACOB	I really don't see the appeal. It's like a glorified bath.
M	NICK	Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the whole thing! You ski all day. Then you hit the town, get trashed, and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin'. Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.
M	NICK (CONT'D)	So the town's dead? Fine, we skip that part and go right to the tub. Trust me. If there's fun to be had, the tub is a good start. Nick gets in. Yes! It's amazing. Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three
M	JACOB	Fuck it. Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually
M	LOU	Well?
M	JACOB	I'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath, but it's nice.
M	NICK	Hit him with some bubbles.
F	ADAM	Coming right up. Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a -- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3 Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING!
M	NICK	Oh my god, I wanna die.
M	JACOB	I need a vitamin water. Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.
F	ADAM	Red Bull or Fresca? Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.
M	LOU	That fucking bear got me good.
F	ADAM	Yeah he did.
M	LOU	But we showed him, didn't we?
F	ADAM	If by showing him, you mean we laughed and he got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers, then yeah, we got him good.
M	LOU	Fuck yeah. Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.
F	ADAM	You just puked.
M	LOU	That's why I'm eating your sandwich. I'm fucking starving.
M	NICK	Guys, look... Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh
F	ADAM	Let's do it!
M	JACOB	What is this, a shitty car club? The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET: -- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag: -- A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT
F	ADAM	Well this place has improved. -- In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.
M	LOU	Really, asshole?
F	ADAM	I'm really glad we stayed. It's gonna be good to get away for a couple of days. I mean not like I want to be away from Lily. You know.
M	NICK	Believe me I know.
F	ADAM	I love her. But you guys are right. I'm gonna be with her for the rest of my life. For the rest of your goddamn life.
F	ADAM	It gets easier, right? No offense, but watching you talk with Courtney-
M	NICK	You're gonna be fine. You'll settle in, get the premium cable package - the usual deal. Adam nods. You'll wake up every morning, comforted by the fact that your wife doesn't wield her family's wealth over your head like a hangman's noose. Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes on...
M	NICK (CONT'D)	You'll breathe the air of life, making the occasional decision - maybe get some lawn furniture. How about steak for dinner? Yes, let's get that juice machine I saw on TV. Let's fucking go for it. Nick stares off into the distance.
F	ADAM	Nick?
M	NICK	Sorry, I lost myself there.
M	DUDE IN SUNGLASSES (O.S.)	Coke? Adam and Nick look at the guy across from them, who presently
M	NICK	That is a lot of cocaine.
F	ADAM	I feel like we're in Scarface. Only with skiing. Skiface. Take it. It's good shit.
M	NICK	I'm gonna pass. Yeah, I'm good. The dude removes his sunglasses. He has a dead look in his
M	DUDE IN SUNGLASSES	You guys a couple of spazzes?
F	ADAM	Spazzes? Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett? Which one's CROCKETT?!
F	ADAM	I'm Crockett, obviously! That's the Don Johnson one, right? The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE.
M	DUDE IN SUNGLASSES	You show me you're not spazzes.
M	NICK	We're not spazzes. The dude extends the coke once more.
M	DUDE IN SUNGLASSES	Show me.
M	NICK	Adam, you gotta chill. You just did one line.
F	ADAM	I've never ridden the horse before.
M	NICK	You're not riding the horse. The horse is heroin. Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting.
F	ADAM	I don't know what kind of animal I'm riding, but it's the best animal of all time. I feel great! Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain
M	NICK	Adam! Jesus. Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety.
M	ON ADAM	He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY
F	ADAM	What a rush! He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Oh wow, are you OK?
M	SMOKING HOT CHICK	No thanks to you, asshole! The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING Jennie O'Keefe! Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him.
M	JENNIE	Do I know you? He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered
M	BLAINE	I'm gonna serve you a knuckle sandwich, airhead. You all right, babe?
M	JENNIE	I think so. Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine
M	BLAINE	Your lift ticket's been revoked. Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.
F	ADAM	Diplomatic immunity. Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Sorry, I was trying to... you can probably patch that up. Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist.
M	BLAINE	You're dead meat, scumbag. Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets
M	JACOB	There you are! My brother's had a few too many triple Venti nonfat lattes if you know what I mean. Are you OK? Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look
M	CHAZ	Dude, they let you bring a skateboard on the mountain?
M	JACOB	It's a snowboard. You know - no wheels.
M	TAD	Genius! Man, not to get all fag on you, but I'm digging your fresh threads, bro. Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on.
M	JACOB	Thank you. It's mostly North Face. A little EMS.
M	CHAZ	Whatever it is, it works.
M	TAD	Totally. What are you doing with this boner? You should be skiing with us. Like permanently. Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.
M	BLAINE	Guys!
M	TAD	I mean, that's if Blaine thinks it's cool and everything. Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed. Get your spaz brother out of here. And for his sake, I don't wanna see him back on my mountain. You're welcome any time though! Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the
F	ADAM	You look JUST like this girl. I had the biggest crush on her-- Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.
M	BLAINE	This is mine now. Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.
M	JACOB	Come on. Let's just go. Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag. Girls and guys wear printed sweaters, feathered dos, and neon
F	ADAM	What is going on? Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT
M	LOU	Guys! I'm so glad you're here. I want to introduce you to Michelle and Sandy. These lovely ladies are having a roller skating party next weekend and no offense, but fuck your wedding -- I'm totally coming back. By the way... Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	There's coke everywhere around here. This place rules! Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we:
M	JACOB	Has anyone else noticed that things around here are weird as shit? Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.
M	LOU	Don't you ruin this. If you wake me from this dream, I'll kill you. What do you think happened?
M	JACOB	I have no idea, but look... Jacob turns up the VOLUME on the TV. The NEWS airs.
M	NEWSCASTER (ON TV)	The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just above 2,000 today...
M	NICK	I'm ruined!
M	NEWSCASTER (ON TV)	In other news, the Tower Commission has rebuked President Reagan for not controlling his national security staff in an arms-for- hostages deal with Iran... For a moment, the guys sit there in stunned silence. Then...
M	LOU	We're in 1971. We're in 1987. Everyone looks stunned and dazed.
M	JACOB	What are we gonna do? I have plans next weekend.
F	ADAM	We all have plans. It's my fucking wedding!
M	NICK	Now hold on, we don't know for sure that we're in 1987. The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 When it's over...
M	NICK (CONT'D)	OK, we're in 1987. Adam stands up, completely losing it.
F	ADAM	What the FUCK is going on?! Nick stands up and calmly takes charge.
M	NICK	Everyone relax. I think I know what's happened. And when we're done discussing it, we're all gonna feel a lot better. Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.
M	NICK (CONT'D)	Two words: black hole. He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly
M	NICK (CONT'D)	I saw a special on the Science Channel. And guess what? Sometimes this happens.
F	ADAM	This happens?
M	NICK	Yes. And the best thing for us to do is to stay put. The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch. Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness.
F	ADAM	This is a big glitch.
M	JACOB	Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes are in space. Not at a ski resort. So does this mean we get to go to girls' locker rooms and see them naked and they can't see us?
M	JACOB	No, we traveled through time. We're not invisible. Lou looks upset.
M	LOU	I'm still gonna do it.
F	ADAM	Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment--
M	NICK	Black hole.
F	ADAM	How are we supposed to get back? For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then:
M	LOU	We find a scientist.
M	LOU	This Dukakis guy seems like he might be the real deal. An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches.
M	MAN IN SUIT	Gentlemen, how may I help you?
M	NICK	We're waiting for a scientist.
M	MAN IN SUIT	I am a scientist.
M	LOU	Where's your white coat?
M	SCIENTIST	I'm not that kind of scientist. Lou stands up and throws down his magazine.
M	LOU	This is bullshit! I told you--
F	ADAM	Wait a minute. Just tell him.
M	NICK	OK. You tell him, Adam.
F	ADAM	Sir, we... This is ridiculous.
M	SCIENTIST	Nothing's too ridiculous in the name of science.
M	JACOB	We're from the future.
M	SCIENTIST	Get the fuck out of here.
F	ADAM	That went well. Lou starts walking off by himself. Where are you going? Lou points to his watch.
M	LOU	Five o'clock. Happy hour. The guys look at him, confused.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be gone, which means the Brew Haus still stands. It's Saturday. They have wet T- shirt contests on Saturdays. The guys' eyebrows raise. After a moment:
F	ADAM	Well, maybe one drink. Just to confirm.
M	NICK	Holy shit. It's that bellhop.
M	JACOB	Should we warn him? I don't want to see this go down. Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and...
M	LOU	Fuck that guy. ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They
M	NICK	God bless our country.
F	ADAM	We're in 1987.
M	JACOB	You can stop saying that. I don't think it's making a difference.
F	ADAM	Seriously, we have to get back. We seriously have to get back! The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.
M	WAITRESS	Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one Bartles and James. The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.
M	WAITRESS (CONT'D)	What? I have lipstick on my teeth? Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on
M	NICK	Hey, if it's available, I'm ordering it. I always wanted one of these when I was little. The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up,
M	JACOB	Can you give us a second? She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	This is gonna be a problem. He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards aren't gonna work and our new money looks fake. The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something:
M	NICK	I've got an idea. As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks Jennie. He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice.
F	ADAM	I still can't believe it's really her!
M	LOU	She's aged remarkably well. Oh, right. Why don't you just go talk to her?
F	ADAM	I should go talk to her. To apologize, of course. You know, nothing inappropriate.
M	LOU	Sure... Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room. Listen putz, if you're gonna try to attack me again, my boyfriend will be here soon. He'll kick your ass. Adam tries to be casual.
F	ADAM	No, no. No ass kicking. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about earlier. I lost control of the old skis there. Looks like I shoulda taken another one of your classes!
M	JENNIE	When did you take my class?
F	ADAM	Certainly not when I was a kid! I mean, that would make no sense! Adam tries to recover. I was here for a convention. Power tools. And regular tools. All sorts of tools. I'm big into tools. It was a couple years ago. Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.
M	JENNIE	Yeah, OK. Have a good night. Jennie starts to walk away with her friends. Hey, where ya going? She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind.
M	JENNIE'S FRIEND	Are you with that guy over there? She discretely points out Jacob.
F	ADAM	Yeah, he's my brother. She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it.
M	JENNIE'S FRIEND	There's a party later tonight at this address. Make sure he comes with you. He's way boss! Adam walks back to his friends.
M	JACOB	How'd it go? He shows them his palm.
F	ADAM	We got invited to a party later.
M	LOU	sweet! What are we gonna do until then?
F	ADAM	How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day? Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.
M	NICK	Bam!
M	LOU	We're millionaires!
M	NICK	Close. It's a thousand bucks.
F	ADAM	Where did you get that money? Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen. Sold them my iPod. Jacob looks incredulous.
M	JACOB	That was NOT a good idea!
M	LOU	I agree. You left so much money on the table. It's a fucking iPod! You could've gotten a LOT more!
M	JACOB	That's not what I--
F	ADAM	Fellas, we are not making progress and we're losing time.
M	NICK	Adam, don't worry. Time's not moving forward in the future.
M	JACOB	Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the lessons learned from Bill and Ted.
M	NICK	Well then I give you Back to the Future.
M	JACOB	That's not fair. You can't go right to Back to the Future.
M	NICK	Why not?
M	JACOB	Back to the Future had a time machine.
M	NICK	Well so did Bill and Ted. Wait, that's it! I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I think we have a time machine.
M	NICK	Adam, all we did is get drunk in the hot tub. Everyone's EYES GO WIDE.
M	LOU	A hot tub time machine.
F	ADAM	Here goes nothing! They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens.
M	NICK	Well, it was worth a shot. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND
M	LOU	I love this place. As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again.
F	ADAM	Guys, we're running out of ideas here!
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	I mean we tried the scientist, the tub -- what the fuck do we do next? Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye.
M	LOU	I know what we do next. The gull wing door opens and Lou steps out, in a foul mood.
M	LOU	Rental car agency fucked us! There's no flux capacitor. Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat,
M	LOU (CONT'D)	We'll travel to 2010. Then one of us will come back and get one of you. And so on and so forth.
M	LOU	Go light on the clutch. I don't wanna lose our deposit. Jacob starts the car. This will not end well.
M	LOU	Oh shit, they found me! I don't know how but they found me! I always wanted to say that. Punch it! Jacob HITS THE GAS.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Let's see the look on this pig's face when we hit 88 and disappear into thin air! Yeah! The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95. This thing's a piece of shit. Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY.
M	JACOB	Hey Lou?
M	LOU	Yeah? We're doing a hundred. I can't control this car. I hear ya.
F	ADAM	So do you think we should run away?
M	LOU	I wonder if we'll still be here for our court appearance.
F	ADAM	If we're still here in four months, I will happily go to jail, because I'll be fucked anyway. A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He
M	TOWEL GUY	Who the hell are you dweebs?! Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD
M	NICK	Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!
M	LOU	I have no tolerance for intruders.
M	NICK	This is probably his room! We're not registered here in 87. Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry.
M	LOU	I'm still pretty OK with it.
F	ADAM	You have a problem.
M	LOU	Just help me put him outside. Hey. Dudes. Our friend's... hellaciously wasted. He partied pretty hearty... to the max. To the extreme max.
M	DUDE #1	Bodacious.
F	ADAM	So you guys wanna fuck with him or what?
M	DUDE #2	Excellent. The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and
M	NICK	Let's just go to sleep. We'll figure everything out in the morning. It's pretty late. Jacob checks his watch, rolling his eyes.
M	JACOB	It's 8:45. The other guys look at their watches, surprised.
M	NICK	Why am I so wiped out?
M	JACOB	Because you're old and lame?
M	LOU	Yeah, fuck that, we're going to that party!
F	ADAM	We are not going to the party.
M	LOU	Hear me out. Lou paces around the room like Patton addressing the troops.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	We saw the scientist. He was worthless. We tried the tub. Dead end. I got us a fucking time machine. From Hertz. It might as well have been a Nissan. Adam shakes his head, as Lou continues.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Gentlemen, it's fucking 1987. Nixon's in the White House, gas is free, and we're about to put a man on the moon!
F	ADAM	Did we go to the same school? Lou turns and addresses Adam directly.
M	LOU	The point is you haven't even met your wife yet! She can't fault you for shit that went down 23 years ago! Even if 23 years ago somehow ends up being tonight! Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's
M	LOU (CONT'D)	It's time to start facing the fact that we may not be going home. And if that's so, then we owe it to ourselves to make the best life we can for ourselves. The guys listen intently, as Lou's speech reaches a
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Because I don't want to be that college freshman who spends the first semester hiding in his dorm room, only to realize that come spring, he has no friends. No!
M	LOU (CONT' D )	I want to be that college freshman who fucks chicks way out of his league before they have an opportunity to realize he's not as cool as he's pretending to be! Nick nods. Even Jacob smiles.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Are you with me? I don't know.
M	LOU	Close enough. We'll talk some more at the party.
F	ADAM	This sweater makes me look like a jerkof f . It's good to be home. In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK TANK. Just as the
M	NICK	Was this like an 80s thing?
M	LOU	If he doesn't lose that arm soon, I'm gonna take it from him myself. With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at He's gonna be a problem. Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are
M	TAD	Hey, glad you could make it! This is your party?
M	CHAZ	Hey man, no hard feelings, all right? If your bro says you're cool, then we're cool. Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party.
M	TAD	There's some people I want you to meet. By the way, bodacious hair. Incredibly chic. Oh yeah? It doesn't really take that much product. It's all in the layering.
M	TAD	Whoa. Product. You're blowing my mind right now. Did you spend time in Europe?
M	CHAZ	Don't tell me. Prague. Do you want some coke?
M	JACOB	Do you have Coke Zero?
M	TAD	Ah, a conscientious objector. I like that. Gotta stay sharp.
M	IN THE KITCHEN	Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of EAGER
M	NICK	These will be ready in 15 minutes.
M	PARTY CHICK	So it's like jello. With vodka.
M	NICK	Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you enjoy a delicious gelatin snack.
M	PARTY CHICK	How come no one ever thought of this before?
M	NICK	Don't know. I just invented it. Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily.
M	PARTY CHICK	I appreciate you.
M	NICK	I love you.
M	IN THE LIVING ROOM	Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD for about 15-20 people. He's
M	JACOB	He did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant about how much he resents Ace of Base.
F	ADAM	That band's from the 90s.
M	JACOB	I know. He made me borrow Tad's video camera. He wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement when we get back. Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room,
F	ADAM	So, you like these guys?
M	JACOB	They're rich, popular, and they shower me with compliments. They're pretty much the best friends I've ever had.
M	ON A BALCONY	A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has removed the cover of a
M	CROWD	Phil! Phil! Phil! Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE,
M	IN THE KITCHEN	Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG, from which he drinks. He
M	NICK'S CROWD	Nick! Nick! Nick! He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates.
M	PARTY GUY	This guy should be in charge of everything!
M	NICK	I should.
M	IN THE LIVING ROOM	Lou SITS ON A COUCH with Michelle, one of the girls we met
M	SANDY	Truth or dare? Lou confers with Michelle before answering.
M	LOU	Dare. Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets
M	SANDY	OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler up his ass. Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.
M	LOU	You son of a bitch! Have you ever played this game before? It's supposed to be awesome! Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and
M	LOU (CONT'D)	This is a horrible thing you're doing and I hope you never have to experience what I am currently going through. Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him.
M	MICHELLE	Your turn! Truth or dare? Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob: Truth. Lou throws up his hands in frustration. He looks miserable,
M	LOU	I don't care. Whatever. This is not the point of the game. OK, each of you has to tell your darkest, most personal secret. Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.
M	JACOB	Oh wow, all right. Let me think. I've never told anyone this, but I was afraid of scary movies until I was 18. I even ran out of the theater a couple of times.
M	SANDY	Oh you poor thing! Come here... She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently. I'm not sure I should tell mine.
M	MICHELLE	Come on! You have to!
M	SANDY	OK, but you can't laugh. We promise. Let's hear it.
M	SANDY	So this one time me and my friend Lori took a train to Baltimore. It was the summer and we wanted to party, but we had no money. So Lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good time and told him that we'd give him a half and half for seventy-five dollars. You know -- a suck and fuck. Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT
M	SANDY (CONT'D)	Anyway, we get him up to his room and Lori starts going down on him, but I really wasn't into it. So I broke a piece of the bathroom mirror and used it to cut his artery on the-heck. Right here... She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.
M	SANDY (CONT'D)	He bled for about an hour before he died. Afterwards, we took his wallet to the bar and found out he only had forty-seven dollars. Michelle GIGGLES.
M	SANDY (CONT'D)	Michelle! You said you wouldn't laugh! I'm sorry! Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked. Adam sits in a chair in the corner, secluded. To his LEFT -- To Adam's RIGHT -- The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S
M	LOU	Fuck you, your turn.
M	JACOB	That's the gay ear, you know. As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD -- He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE
F	ADAM	So I lied to you earlier. I wasn't here for a power tool convention. Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends.
M	JENNIE	I know. You don't look like you could handle power tools.
F	ADAM	The truth is, Jennie, I've always liked you. But I've never really known you. I really wasn't supposed to meet you again.
M	JENNIE	Who are you?! Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.
F	ADAM	I came here from the future. She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.
M	JENNIE	Let me guess. You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two? Or maybe you're wondering if these are astronaut pants?
F	ADAM	Astronaut pants?
M	JENNIE	Because my ass is out of this world? Give me a break, spaz. I've heard them all. She turns away. Adam goes after her.
F	ADAM	No! No spaceship. No astronaut pants. Just regular time travel. With normal pants.
M	JENNIE	OK, what's the punch line? An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.
M	BLAINE	I thought I told you to stay off my mountain, partner!
M	JENNIE	Blaine, stop!
M	BLAINE	You talking to my girl? Huh? I can't hear you. Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.
M	JENNIE	Blaine, that's enough! Let him go! He can't breathe! Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole.
M	BLAINE	Can't breathe? Is that right? Can you breathe, partner? What's that? I can't hear you. Just tell me you can't breathe and I'll stop. Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.
M	BLAINE (CONT'D)	He's not saying anything. I guess he can breathe. Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam.
M	BLAINE (CONT'D)	Babe, stop. Jennie, stop! Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She
M	BLAINE (CONT'D)	Baby, I'm sorry. See what you made me do?!
M	JENNIE	Screw you, Blaine! Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along Come on, let's go! Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam.
M	LOU (V.0.)	Sandy, I don't know what you did with this wine, but it is delightful. Jacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm.
M	SANDY	It's from a box. There's lots!
M	LOU	Mmm. Fantastic. Do you mind if I borrow my friend? We'll only be a moment.
M	LOU	You're gonna fuck her!
M	JACOB	I'm not gonna have sex with her. She killed a guy!
M	LOU	That guy was undesirable. You heard her. It was about the money.
M	JACOB	Great, so she's a prostitute. I'm not sleeping with a hooker either.
M	LOU	She's not a hooker. She's a girl who did what she had to do to make a few bucks. Listen, she's probably awesome in bed.
M	JACOB	She probably has a hairy vagina.
M	LOU	Exactly! Jacob looks confused.
M	JACOB	I'm not having this conversation. It's pointless. I don't have a condom.
M	LOU	Perfect! Me neither! No one here uses condoms. It's like heaven. Only with a lot more coke. Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	How do I look?
M	JACOB	Like a fucking madman? He slaps Jacob's arms.
M	LOU	Rock and roll. Lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Who's ready to get laid by an awesome penis?!
F	ADAM	Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That's gonna cost you.
M	JENNIE	How much?
F	ADAM	I'll tell ya what... Adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of I'm not supposed to do this. But I'm gonna upgrade you to Marvin Gardens. It's a suite. Plus, there's an excellent buffet and a view of the pool. Jennie laughs, despite herself. She looks around, as if No one's gonna see you hanging out with the creepy spaz. Don't worry.
M	JENNIE	I'm sorry I called you those names.
F	ADAM	Hey, it's cool. I was being creepy and spazzy.
M	JENNIE	You're still not gonna tell me how you know me?
F	ADAM	I'm from the future.
M	JENNIE	Fine, let's just drop it. I'm glad you're feeling better. Blaine had no right to hit you. I bet he's going out of his mind right now.
F	ADAM	What are you doing with a douche like him anyway? You're so much better than that.
M	JENNIE	Yeah, well guys like you come to visit. Guys like him live here.
F	ADAM	So if I lived here, I'd have a shot? For a moment, Jennie is thrown off. She's about to say
M	JENNIE	I'm gonna get going. Adam stands up with her.
M	JENNIE (CONT'D)	Thanks for being a good guy. I don't remember the last time I had this much fun playing such a stupid game. She gives Adam a sweet KISS ON THE CHEEK.
M	JENNIE (CONT'D)	If you run into Blaine, you can tell him I blew you. But that's all. We didn't do anything else. We didn't do anything! Shh. It's our little secret. Jennie exits, leaving Adam confused. On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the
M	LOU	Tab?
M	JACOB	Stop talking to me! Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex -- it is
F	ADAM	Jennie! He looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed. What are you doing here?! Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS. He's freaked out.
M	JENNIE	I thought about what you said and you're right. I should be with you.
F	ADAM	I didn't necessarily say that.
M	JENNIE	I want you, Adam! She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING
F	ADAM	Oh my god! She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then --
M	LILY (O.S.)	What the hell is going on here? Adam pushes Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room.
F	ADAM	Lily?
M	LILY	So you do like her better than me?
F	ADAM	No, she just-- Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	What's all this? Jennie?
M	LILY	What's wrong with my vagina, Adam?
F	ADAM	Nothing's wrong with it. It's beautiful. In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up.
M	NICK	It's a beautiful vagina. Among the prettiest I've ever seen.
F	ADAM	Stay out of it, Nick!
M	LILY	Would it be so bad to spend the rest of your life with my vagina?
F	ADAM	No. It wouldn't at all. Lily turns and walks out the door. Lily, it wouldn't! I love your vagina! I love your vaginaaaaaa! Vagina... huh? He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room.
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	I just really need to get a few things off my chest. You're domineering and you think you have all the answers, but you don't. Not by a long shot. Nick is getting emotional.
M	NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	You think you're better than me? Last night I made jello shots and everybody loved me.
M	NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	They didn't care that I only brought home 60k last year. They loved me for me. They didn't go throwing their rich parents' weight around. I don't know, Courtney.
M	6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)	It's OK. Nick CRIES a little bit harder.
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	It's so good to hear your voice. I love you, princess. I really do. You just make it so hard on me sometimes.
M	6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)	It's OK. You're right. It's OK. I just want it to be OK. Adam starts registering some of this conversation.
F	ADAM	Who are you talking to? Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver.
M	NICK	Courtney.
F	ADAM	What do you mean "Courtney?" Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE.
M	ADAM (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)	Hello! Adam, freaked out, HANGS UP his phone.
F	ADAM	Get off the phone!! But Nick is down the rabbit hole.
M	NICK (ON PHONE)	Baby, I gotta go. Just think about what I said. We're so great together. It's like when we're having sex - the way our bodies become one, as we both embrace the passion of the moment-- On the other end, COURTNEY'S DAD has picked up the phone. Nick hangs up the phone and stares at it, freaked out. Adam
M	NICK	OK, so that may have been bad.
F	ADAM	What were you thinking? The DOOR OPENS and Lou strolls in, looking quite fresh.
M	LOU	Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry? This guy! He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him --
M	TOWEL GUY	Hey, get the hell out of my room! In one move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door
M	NICK	Oh, we're going to jail.
M	LOU	Help me put him in the closet.
F	ADAM	Has anyone seen Jacob?
M	LOU	He's grabbing drinks with Tad and Chaz. Which is what we should do. We'll start at the Brew Haus and do a three drink crawl up the street-- Adam gets more fed up than ever.
F	ADAM	Guys! I refuse to accept that we're stuck in 1987! Maybe you're loving it, Lou. But you don't get it. Nick's insane, Jacob's become a bigger douche than before, and I need to get back for my goddamn rehearsal dinner? Which is tomorrow! Adam. I know I don't look like I understand, but I do. You have a beautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world. And if you could, you'd literally travel across time for her.
F	ADAM	Yes.
M	LOU	I get it, man. Life is about these moments. Moments where a regular Joe becomes a hero. Moments where you dig deep and find the motivation... the courage... the guts to do what's right and what's necessary. It's moments like these... Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Jesus, how come nobody told me there was coke out here? Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	What was I saying? Adam and Nick get out and towel off. Lou follows.
F	ADAM	Maybe we have to learn something?
M	NICK	What do you mean?
F	ADAM	You know, like Groundhog Day. We have to learn the meaning of life or some shit. Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub I've gotta stop doing cocaine and I need to go to the hospital. I just saw a fucking kitten explode.
M	NICK	I saw it too. The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but
F	ADAM	It didn't explode. It vanished. It went back... to the present.
M	LOU	This is the present.
F	ADAM	Our old present. So it is the tub! Lou POINTS at something.
M	LOU	Um... The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running.
F	ADAM	OK. You guys know what to do.
F	ADAM	This isn't working.
M	LOU	Maybe these aren't the right kittens? Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way.
F	ADAM	We'll split up. Get as many different cats as you can. Let's all meet back here in an hour.
M	LOU	You can count on me!
M	RICK	Yes!
M	LOU	Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are gonna lose by 3 in overtime.
M	RICK	Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've got ten large on this game.
M	LOU	Not only that, but I bet you Elway's gonna throw a touchdown with 37 seconds left.
M	RICK	Fat chance, pal. Elway's done nothing all day.
M	LOU	Care to make it interesting?
M	RICK	Who the hell are you? Lou thinks about the question for a moment.
M	LOU	Name's Musselman. Hank Musselman. I've got a cool name, huh?
M	RICK	It's a good name. What did you have in mind, Musselman?
M	LOU	I win -- your wife gives me a blowjob. A classy one. For the first time, Candace looks less than bored. She does a
M	RICK	All right, buddy, fuck off.
M	LOU	You win -- you can kill me. Any way you want. Knife, gun, torch, sword... I'll even make a video exonerating you.
M	RICK	Yeah, right...
M	LOU	I'm serious. You look like a man who has everything. Except the license to kill. Care to gamble? Rick looks at Lou long and hard. Lou doesn't flinch.
M	RICK	37 seconds?
M	LOU	Exactly.
M	RICK	You have a deal. As Rick and Lou shake hands, Candace makes a show of looking Don't worry, babe. This yahoo's made a wager he can't possibly win. Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in Look. Who am I? I'm your wife. Nuts in my mouth. Get it? I like it slow and romantic.
M	NICK	Oh, sorry man. Hey! How's that iPod working out for you?
M	JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	Oh, it's a very nice toy.
M	NICK	If you like that, I've got a phone back at the lodge that will knock your socks off.
M	JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	I wish I could see it. But I am on my way to a very important business meeting.
M	NICK	Oh yeah? More important than Bluetooth?
M	JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	My associates and I are co- financing a... how do you say it... supermarket business. You're not going to Boston, by any chance?
M	JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	Yes! Boston! We leave tonight.
M	NICK	You're gonna franchise out the Gelman's Mom and Pop!
M	JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	Yes! How do you know this? Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.
M	NICK	Walk with me a minute. Let me tell you about some companies you should really be looking into...
M	CHAZ	You really are a gas, Jacob. Tad and I think you're the cat's pajamas.
M	JACOB	Thanks. I like you guys, too. A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad
M	GEOFFREY	Gentlemen.
M	TAD	Geoffrey, please meet Jacob. Excuse his Jewish name. He really quite exceeds it. Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand.
M	GEOFFREY	Jacob, would you like some too? He offers a pill bottle.
M	JACOB	What is it?
M	CHAZ	Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a pharmacist, but we don't hold that against him.
M	JACOB	Rohypnol?
M	TAD	You slip it to a chick who won't go to third. Give it an hour and you'll be rounding home. This is a date rape drug. What the fuck is date rape?
M	JACOB	These are roofies!
M	CHAZ	Roofies... I like that!
M	TAD	Yeah, it takes the clinical name right out of it. It sounds so fresh, chicks might even take it voluntarily! Hey, can we use that? Jacob looks beside himself.
F	ADAM	I got regular cats. I figured maybe the kitten was a fluke. Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.
M	NICK	Come here. He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something.
M	LOU	There!
F	ADAM	What am I looking at? It's some kind of stain.
M	LOU	Smell it.
F	ADAM	I'm not smelling it. Smell the stain. Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He
F	ADAM	What is that?
M	NICK	Red Bull.
M	GUY IN TUB	Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying to get a handjob here.
F	ADAM	So you're telling me that Red Bull plus hot tub equals time travel? Mmm hmm. Hank Musselman's getting the Nobel Prize.
F	ADAM	Who the fuck is Hank Musselman?
M	NICK	There was just enough Red Bull for the kitten. Not nearly enough for a human. It's a weight distribution thing.
F	ADAM	How did you even figure this out?
M	LOU	Scientific method.
M	NICK	He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn't lick the stain.
M	LOU	I thought it was some guy's jizz.
F	ADAM	What's wrong with you?
M	LOU	It worked, didn't it?
M	NICK	Yeah, except one little problem. There's no Red Bull in 1987. For a moment, they're all bummed again. Then Adam gets an
F	ADAM	Yes there is! Come on! Adam heads for the door, as Lou and Nick follow. You can't be here. If Blaine sees you, he'll snap your neck. I told him I blew you and he's not happy.
F	ADAM	Why would you do that?! Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes
M	NICK	Look. Lou looks to where Nick is looking:
M	LOU	Holy shit! Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to where the fuck are you going?! Lou walks right up to his YOUNGER SELF and looks himself
M	YOUNG LOU	What the hell do you want, old man? Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and
M	YOUNG LOU (CONT'D)	What the fuck, dude?! I think you broke my nose! My parents are gonna sue the shit out of you!
M	LOU	Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do a damn thing. They're losers.
M	YOUNG LOU	How do you know my parents?
M	LOU	Listen to me. Start putting minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight. Then, when Propecia comes on the market, start taking it. Every day. Hair is important.
M	YOUNG LOU	I don't give a shit about hair.
M	LOU	You will! Or I'll tell everyone about how you jerked off to that issue of Playgirl. It was confusing! There were naked people and it had "girl" in the title!
M	LOU	Hey, you don't have to justify to me, pal. Who are you?
M	LOU	I'm God. Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's your funeral. He's in the warehouse at the end of Lawrence. Good luck.
M	LOU	Moment of truth. Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair. That fucker! Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being Lou touches his nose.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Oh, that's just great. Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition.
M	JACOB	Hey guys!
F	ADAM	I thought you were with douche patrol.
M	JACOB	Yeah I was. But it turned out those guys are date rapists.
F	ADAM	Ah.
M	NICK	Adam, where are we going? Adam gets a look of determination again.
F	ADAM	To get my bag. We get that, we have the Red Bull, and our ticket home.
M	LOU	Yes! The race is on!
F	ADAM	What race?
M	LOU	Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski resort? Disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race. Usually at dawn. It's the law.
F	ADAM	You're an idiot.
M	BLAINE	Welcome to my lair.
F	ADAM	You live here?
M	NICK	Yeah, this is kind of a shitty place to live.
M	BLAINE	I don't live here. Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely.
F	ADAM	Look. Blaine. I think we got off on the wrong foot. You have some issue with me.
M	BLAINE	You get blown by my girl? I'll say that's one hell of an issue.
M	LOU	Whoa! You got blown?!
F	ADAM	She didn't blow me. She lied to you to make you jealous. I'm not trying to steal Jennie. I just wanna get my bag.
M	BLAINE	Oh, your bag. I was wondering when you'd come around for that. Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates.
F	ADAM	Yeah, I'll just take it and get out of your way.
M	BLAINE	You will? Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND.
F	ADAM	Whattya say? Can we work this out like gentlemen? Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES.
M	NICK	What is this town's obsession with knives? How about I work this out like... a butcher? Just then, LIGHT SPILLS INTO THE DARK WAREHOUSE. A GUY in a
M	GUY IN POLO SHIRT	Hey! Scumbuckets! Back to work! Like naughty children being caught red handed, Blaine and his
M	JACOB	You guys are posers! You're not better than me!
M	TAD	Jacob, I wish you hadn't seen us like this. Adam stands near Blaine, who helps a WOMAN. These would look so good with your light complexion.
F	ADAM	Listen asshole! I want my bag! Will you excuse me for a moment? Blaine walks behind the COUNTER and SHOVES THE BAG in a SAFE.
M	BLAINE (CONT'D)	Safe's on a timer. It'll open tomorrow. We race at dawn. Winner gets the bag. Loser leaves town. Lou turns to Nick.
M	LOU	See? I told you! I don't wanna race you.
M	BLAINE	Then I guess you don't want your bag. See you at dawn.
F	ADAM	Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a mean dick. Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes.
M	NICK	What are we gonna do?
M	LOU	That chick blew you?! I've got a race to win. Europe's "The Final Countdown" begins playing over a MONTAGE: -- Gear is polished. -- In the SUITE, Adam gets dressed in his GEAR. -- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is -- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.
M	JACOB	Just stick to the plan and you're gonna be fine. Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.
F	ADAM	Jacob, I'm sorry for not always being the big brother I should've been. I was away at college, Mom gave you my Sega - there were a whole host of issues. Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.
M	JACOB	I know. I'm sorry too. I put a few things before my family and took my guilt out on you. I guess it was an inevitable I'd end up part of a roofie ring. Adam smiles and extends his hand.
F	ADAM	Friends? Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet.
M	JACOB	Brothers. They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted.
M	LOU	Gay. Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his
F	ADAM	I didn't think you guys would show.
M	BLAINE	This was my idea.
F	ADAM	It's gonna make my victory taste all the more sweeter. Like a Peach Snapple.
M	BLAINE	A what?
F	ADAM	You'll see. Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up.
M	BLAINE	What's that?
F	ADAM	You're not afraid of getting beat by a guy on a skateboard, are you?
M	BLAINE	I've seen you in action. You're reckless and terrible.
F	ADAM	Reckless and terrible's my middle name. Because I feel the need... for speed! Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	Catch ya at the bottom. Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna
F	ADAM	Here goes nothing. Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the
M	BLAINE	You can't beat me! I was born on this mountain!
F	ADAM	I was born in a hospital like a normal baby! Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR! Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S
M	PHIL	Ahhhh! My arm!!!
M	LOU	Yes! But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line An ALL-OUT PARTY is going on in the guys' suite. GUESTS Sandy and Michelle flirt with the two dudes who took brief The Coke Guy from the gondola talks with the Brew Haus Adam's leg is in a CAST, as he sits at a table with Jacob,
M	NICK	You did it, man.
F	ADAM	Ah, it was nothing. I just fell down the mountain.
M	NICK	It was a beautiful fall. Lou goes into Adam's backpack and pulls out the SANDWICH, Tell me you are not going to keep eating that. Lou takes a bite and SHRUGS.
M	LOU	Chicken parm. It's my favorite.
F	ADAM	Chicken parm? Adam takes the sandwich from Lou. He looks at it closely. Chicken parm. On this roll. The guys look confused, as Adam stares at the sandwich.
M	JACOB	Adam, what is it?
M	ADAM (V.0.)	It was our first date. You know those nights that are just perfect? This wasn't one of those nights.
M	ADAM (V.0.)	If Lily knew where we were, I'm sure she would've walked home. And I wouldn't have blamed her.
M	ADAM (V.0.)	We were so hungry by the time we found that deli, we would've eaten anything. So what if it wasn't foie gras and pino noir. It was chicken parm and Italian soda. And it couldn't have been more perfect.
M	NICK	That sandwich was special, huh?
F	ADAM	You could say that. You could also say it gave me horrible diarrhea.
M	ADAM (V.0.)	Lily had every opportunity to leave. She didn't know me at all and she certainly didn't owe me anything after the night I put her through. But she stayed.
M	ADAM (V.0.)	She saw me at my worst and she stayed. Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.
F	ADAM	Don't you see? This is more than a sandwich. It represents all that shit. All that puke.
M	LOU	Keep the sandwich.
M	JACOB	This is disgusting.
F	ADAM	She gave me this as a reminder of her love. Or to give me horrible diarrhea so I didn't leave the room during the bachelor party. But mostly as a reminder of her love. Adam holds up the sandwich. This is the reason I need to go home. Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	I'm gonna go prep the tub. Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS.
M	LOU	Do you have any stories about these chips or can I eat them?
M	JENNIE	There you are!
F	ADAM	Jennie! What are you doing here?
M	JENNIE	Making good on a rumor. Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS.
F	ADAM	Whoa. Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.
M	JENNIE	When I saw you win that race against Blaine, everything changed for me. I realize now that I deserve more. I deserve a winner. Come and get your prize. Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.
F	ADAM	Yeah, I... can't. She covers up, embarrassed.
M	JENNIE	Oh my god. I missed my opportunity.
F	ADAM	No, I'm not sure there ever was an opportunity. Jennie, you're terrific. You've brought me so many moments of joy, you'll never know. But I shouldn't have given you the wrong idea. Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	The truth is there's a girl I need to go see. We have plans to spend the rest of our lives together. And I can't wait any longer. And I'm totally cool with it. Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	One day, you're going to find the right guy who's willing to give up everything and travel across time and space for your love. She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her. I would totally blow you right now.
F	ADAM	I know you would.
M	NICK	We don't have to go yet, Adam. Things are just getting fun.
M	JACOB	And we can do whatever we want without any real consequences. That's a lot to give up. That's how I know I'm doing the right thing. Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.
M	JACOB	Where's the Red Bull?
M	BLAINE (V.0.)	You looking for this? Across the patio, a drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.
M	BLAINE (CONT'D)	You couldn't leave well enough alone, could ya? You couldn't just win the race and call it a day? You had to have Jennie too.
F	ADAM	I don't want Jennie.
M	BLAINE	That's funny. I don't want this soda, either. Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,
F	ADAM	Nooooo! Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the Why? Lou takes Blaine's pulse.
M	LOU	Holy shit! You may have killed this guy! No wait... wait... I've got a pulse. Eh, so much for that. Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.
M	NICK	I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.
F	ADAM	The Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.
M	JACOB	Not necessarily. Everyone looks toward Jacob.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	The Red Bull isn't really gone. It's in him. A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.
M	NICK	It's worth a shot. Lou stands outside the tub, fully dressed.
F	ADAM	Come on, Lou.
M	LOU	Nah, I'll take a rain check.
M	NICK	What are you talking about?
M	LOU	Listen, your lives at home sound all beautiful and happy with your barbecues and swimming pools and "oh, that sandwich reminds of some gay shit I did one time." Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	But my life back there sucks. And in case you haven't noticed, my life here fucking rules. So I have a coke problem? I'll go to rehab. I have no money? I'll stop winning sex and start winning dollars. Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987. And you'll excuse me, but I value banging young chicks way more than all of your friendships combined. No offense. Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.
F	ADAM	Yeah, no, I get it. Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.
M	NICK	Makes perfect sense, man. Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.
M	LOU	I don't hate you as much as I used to.
M	JACOB	I hate you a little less also. Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.
F	ADAM	OK, whenever you're ready, Lou.
M	LOU	One small step for man! One giant asshole puking in a hot tub! Here goes nothing! Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE...
M	NICK	OK, well maybe if we-- A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down, Only Lou is missing.
F	ADAM	What happened? Did it work?
M	NICK	I didn't feel anything. Guys, look. They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI
M	NICK	Dammit. Even the deck furniture's the same. We fucking blew it. It didn't work.
F	ADAM	Where's Lou?
M	LOU (O.S.)	Right on schedule! Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's "off" about
M	NICK	Ahhh!
M	LOU	Oh, the face, eh? I was curious how you'd react. Didn't think you'd be scared.
F	ADAM	Lou?
M	LOU	You're damn right it's me.
F	ADAM	What happened?
M	LOU	You just traveled 23 years in three seconds. Took me 23 years. It's good to see you guys!
M	JACOB	We're back? It all looks the same.
M	LOU	It better! You know how much I pay the groundspeople around here? A lot. But that's all right, I'm fucking loaded. Look at all this. Everyone looks confused.
F	ADAM	Will you fill in some of the blanks for me, please?
M	LOU	I'll give you the short version, because time is of the essence. First of all, to settle an old bet, time most definitely has been moving forward. It is exactly three days since you've arrived here in beautiful Havenhurst. Jacob looks at Nick.
M	JACOB	Told you.
M	LOU	Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I own most of V
M	LOU (CONT'D)	I've been reimagining the state as my own personal playground. You could say I'm a little bit like Michael Jackson, except I don't fuck kids. Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	I do fuck them, though. Haven't gone above 24 years old in 10 years and even then, it was a mistake. A horrible mistake.
F	ADAM	Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?
M	LOU	Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2 hours to get to New Jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner. Great, I blew it.
M	LOU	Not even a little bit. I have a helicopter waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes away. The guys look stunned.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	I had some time to plan. God, it's good to have you guys back!
M	LOU	By the way, Adam, I hope you don't mind. Right after you left, I fucked Jennie silly.
F	ADAM	Why would she have sex with you?
M	LOU	You get the big time assist. All that talk of her finding the right guy who's willing to give up everything? Made her wetter than a log flume. She's all-time top five.
F	ADAM	Good to hear.
M	NICK	Lou, I gotta ask you something.
M	LOU	Time travel paradox.
M	NICK	Exactly. Aren't there now two of you living here in 2010?
M	LOU	Think really hard about that one. What happened to me when I was 19? Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes
M	NICK	No way...
F	ADAM	You went missing and were never found.
M	LOU	Yeah, you're gonna have some lingering memories of both versions.
F	ADAM	Wait a minute, what happened to... you know. Other Lou.
M	LOU	You don't wanna know.
F	ADAM	Lou...
M	LOU	The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't take even a little bit of direction. Pretty soon I realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around -- as cool as that sounds -- didn't make very much sense to me.
M	LOU	So I took care of the problem.
M	NICK	What did you do?
M	LOU	I had to do it.
F	ADAM	What did you do?
M	LOU	I killed myself.
F	ADAM	Jesus Christ.
M	LOU	Yeah, it was really some existential shit. I mean, here I am committing homicide and I'm actually committing suicide.
M	NICK	How could you?
M	LOU	It was easy actually. For a minute, I thought I might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing. You know, the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof? Especially after that whole nose thing. But no, it was just a murder. I didn't suffer.
F	ADAM	I don't wanna hear any more.
M	LOU	It was strangulation.
F	ADAM	I don't wanna hear any more! They sit in horrified silence for a bit.
M	LOU	get there. Your families won't know me. Although I'm sure they're huge fans. So hey, getting married, huh? Taking the plunge! Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused.
M	NICK	This makes no sense at all.
M	LILY	Don't you ever let me take your phone again! I'm here on time. Just like I promised. Nick sits down next to COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat.
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	I'm so happy to see you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Me too!
F	ADAM	You're the one. Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES.
M	LILY	Oh my god, what happened? My fault entirely, madam! The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL
M	GUY AT TABLE	Hey, it's Lou Blustein! The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the
M	LOU	I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I mistakenly wandered into your fiance's path. His broken leg is my broken heart. My most humble apologies. Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She Lou gets up and whispers to Adam.
M	LOU (CONT'D)	See? I'm awesome here. You shoulda stayed out of that tub.
M	NICK	I was thinking we'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon. That's... if it's OK with you?
F	COURTNEY	Why wouldn't it be OK with me? That sounds nice.
M	COURTNEY (CONT'D)	You look so good in this shirt, by the way. Nice choice. She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance.
M	NICK	So... how are your parents?
F	COURTNEY	Still working hard. I really wish they could retire already, but it's tough competing with the big chains. I mean, they just have the one store... Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork! We have to get back to Tokyo. I have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal. You know what they say about hard work. Builds character.
M	BY THE BAR	Adam orders drinks, as his PHONE RINGS. He picks it up and
F	ADAM	Ahh!
M	JACOB	This is why we shouldn't have sold that iPod. Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	The Japanese have apparently cornered the technology sector over the past 20 years. We've dealt American businesses quite an irreparable blow.
F	ADAM	What does that mean for us?
M	JACOB	Pretty much nothing for us personally. We just get cooler phones and iPods and shit.
F	ADAM	Oh. Great! Jacob CLICKS OFF and disappears, as Lily approaches. Adam You're so beautiful.
M	LILY	I know you were only gone for a couple days, but I missed you so much. Adam takes her hand.
F	ADAM	Come on, let's get out of here. We have unfinished business. Lily smiles. She gets into it.
M	LILY	It's about time. OK, what's the fantasy? How about you're the woman I love and I'm the man of your dreams?
M	LILY	Booor-ing!!
F	ADAM	OK, you're a nurse and a snake bit my penis.
M	LILY	Done and done. They bolt for the door and we
M	LOU	So you're friends with the bride?
M	BEAUTIFUL GIRL	Can you keep a secret? I'm actually kinda crashing the party.
M	LOU	Naughty girl. You're secret's safe with me.
M	BEAUTIFUL GIRL	I'm just in town for a couple of nights. I'm actually looking for my father. We've never met.
M	LOU	I'm from here. Maybe I know him.
M	BEAUTIFUL GIRL	His name is Hank Musselman. For a moment, Lou's expression FREEZES. He blinks. Then --
M	LOU	No, never heard of him. He goes back to MAKING OUT WITH HER and we:
