M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	TINA	The N.T.S.B. guys are here.
F	CRAWFORD	Yep. - which knocks over the bottle. It skitters across the desk, Crawford just walks out past Tina. N.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding
F	CRAWFORD	It's here.
M	ROB	What about dinner tonight?
F	JENNIFER	We go out to dinner - we might never come back.
M	ROB	Okay. I want to wake up with you. I want to...
M	ROB	...at least see where you live. I live...here. Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell
F	CRAWFORD	Lieutenant Nunally, please.
M	OPERATOR (ON PHONE)	He doesn't come on til six. You want his voice mail?
F	CRAWFORD	No. Thank you. I'll see him later. Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low The lock clicks to green.
F	JENNIFER	You're - home early.
F	CRAWFORD	I just felt a sudden urge.
F	JENNIFER	Are you...okay? Crawford shrugs, smiling strangely. He looks pained.
F	CRAWFORD	I could use a hug. Jennifer submits guiltily. Crawford embraces her, tight.
F	JENNIFER	Have you been drinking? He lets go and she steps back. Studying him. Scared.
F	CRAWFORD	I've been watching you sleep. At night.
F	JENNIFER	That's creepy.
F	CRAWFORD	Sometimes when I'm at work, I'll start thinking about you and I'll just get - just - overwhelmed.
F	JENNIFER	Tommy -
F	CRAWFORD	It's a dense, crushing - geophysical force. Like I'm pinned. At the core - where things change. You ever get that way about me, Jen?
F	JENNIFER	What are you talking about?
F	CRAWFORD	I'm trying to describe my feelings.
F	JENNIFER	Those don't sound like feelings. No? What's the sound of one feeling...in a forest?
F	JENNIFER	You think you're so much smarter than I am. That must make you feel very powerful.
F	CRAWFORD	Helpless, actually. Silence.
F	JENNIFER	Okay. Maybe it's time to really talk.
F	CRAWFORD	No.
F	JENNIFER	No? He shakes his head. Frayed and worn, she sighs.
F	JENNIFER	Fine. Whatever. I'll make you some dinner. He watches her turn and head for the kitchen. To her back:
F	CRAWFORD	I know. Everything. She stops, exhales. Looking down. Afraid. Grateful it's
F	JENNIFER	I'm so sorry.
F	CRAWFORD	Don't be. Knowledge is pain. I'm used to that. Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy. Preparing herself to
F	CRAWFORD	It's not like I don't let little pleasures, in return for the pain. She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear. The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud. He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in
M	GIFFORD	Tom? Jen? Everything okay in there?
F	CRAWFORD	Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE! He calmly aims up at the frosted-glass transom and fires Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around, UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan
M	SWAT COMMANDER	You the Negotiator?
M	NUNALLY	Yeah. What do we know?
F	CRAWFORD	Yes?
M	NUNALLY	Mr. Crawford?
F	CRAWFORD	Who is this?
M	NUNALLY	My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally. I'm a hostage negotiator for the Los - Crawford hangs up. Thoughtful. Mr. Crawford? Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But
M	NUNALLY	Okay then. Here we go. He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.
M	NUNALLY (O.S.)	Mr. Crawford? The door pushes open very slowly. Nunally stays in the
M	NUNALLY	Hey. Crawford studies him, staying back.
F	CRAWFORD	Get rid of the vampires. Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn
F	CRAWFORD	Do I call you Rob?
M	NUNALLY	If you want. CRAWFORD Not vampires.
M	NUNALLY	What?
F	CRAWFORD	Not vampires. Ghouls. Sorry. Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. Sees the small
M	NUNALLY	Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give me the gun - so I can pay more attention to what you're saying? Crawford sighs.
F	CRAWFORD	Is that your best shot? So to speak.
M	NUNALLY	I just think - maybe it would -
F	CRAWFORD	Tell you what: I will if you will. Nunally frowns, wary. Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room,
F	CRAWFORD	We both put down our guns. At the same time. Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer
F	CRAWFORD	We set them down and step away. Then you can "pay more attention" to what I'm saying. Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the CRAWFORD Happy ending, then. Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes - Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge
M	NUNALLY	Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned that your wife -
F	CRAWFORD	It's Tom.
M	NUNALLY	I'm sorry?
F	CRAWFORD	You can call me Tom.
M	NUNALLY	Tom. Your wife. Is she here?
F	CRAWFORD	Yes. Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of
M	NUNALLY	Is she all right? Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see.
F	CRAWFORD	I don't think she is. I shot her, Rob. Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove -
M	NUNALLY	You shot your wife. It was like I just suddenly - snapped. We were arguing - and I got the gun.
M	NUNALLY	- okay - I hear you -
F	CRAWFORD	And I shot her in the head. I know it was wrong. Are you listening to me? But Nunally is not. He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the
M	NUNALLY	Oh Jesus Christ. Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle -
M	NUNALLY	We need a medic in here! Get the ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW! Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in
M	NUNALLY	Oh no - God no - I can't - get a - Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody.
F	CRAWFORD	You know, I think I read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. It's on the inner surface of the upper thigh. If you put your fingers - you know, right up inside her dress - Nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford's - as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back -
M	PARAMEDIC	Wait a second - she's not dead! Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work -
M	SWAT COMMANDER	You all right? Nunally "wakes" - nods. Absently:
M	NUNALLY	Yeah. I'm good. To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and - but the narrow futon bed is already empty. He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at As he signs, we glimpse: - hereby give notice that I will be resigning my position at the District Attorney's Office as of Novemb- Willy savors the moment. Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy
M	WILLY	Mrs. Demello? MRS. DEMELLO! Your CAR! Silence. He sighs. Shuts the door and presses a button near There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Come on, Phil: I called you as a courtesy, and you start looking to take advantage?
M	WILLY	I'm not knocking it down to a Class C. My backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law with - oh, right, a "golfing accident"? Your client owns one golf club and no golf balls - and the "accident" took place in the stairway of an illegal after- hours gambling club. Yeah, okay - I'll see you in court. His cell phone rings. As he gets it:
M	WILLY	Well, I won't see you in court, but someone from this office will. You take it up with them, I gotta go. Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes. Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG (mid-30s) throws the
M	NORMAN	Wooton Sims?! Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell:
M	WILLY	No, I didn't. Wow. Okay. Norman mouths "WOOTON SIMS?!" repeatedly during:
M	WILLY	No - short notice is...fine. No, I can. Black tie. Sure. What time? Okay. Yes. Thank her. He hangs up, exhales slowly. Looks at Norman.
M	NORMAN	Wooton - SIMS?! Wooton Sims?!
M	WILLY	Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over and over. It's starting to sound like nonsense words.
M	NORMAN	You asshole!
M	WILLY	Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims." As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman -
M	NORMAN	How the hell did you get a job at Wooton Sims?! I can't even get an interview!
M	NORMAN	I've been here five years. I'm your supervisor. I graduated USC, summa!
M	WILLY	We're just going to pretend he's not talking, okay?
M	MONA NORMAN	No problem. I'm serious.
M	WILLY	I'm really jammed-up all day, and I need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight.
M	NORMAN	A tuxedo?! Oh, come on! You are so full of shit.
M	WILLY	There must be a place that does that, right - same day? I'm also gonna need a messenger to bring it here. This is my suit size and my shirt size...I really appreciate this. Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card.
F	MONA	What's going on?
M	WILLY	Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of this committee -
M	NORMAN	"Bob" Wooton?!
M	WILLY	It's what the man told me to call him. You're gonna need to pick out a style, Willy.
M	WILLY	A style.
F	GLADYS	For the tuxedo. Willy hesitates, in over his head. A DDA helpfully does the
M	WILLY	I don't know - I just don't want to look like I'm going to the prom.
F	GLADYS	You wanna go Classic. Fix him up.
F	MONA	We'll get you something Classic. Willy Slocum's office.
M	NORMAN	Make sure it comes with cuff-links and knee-pads.
M	WILLY	Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be back in high school.
F	MONA	Willy? Her tone makes him - and everyone else - turn.
F	MONA	God wants to see you.
M	WILLY	Our God?
F	MONA	Who art on the Eleventh Floor. Willy, startled, looks around. Approving nods, raised There is no justice! There is no justice in the city of Los Angeles! Willy hesitates. Looks around: he's never been here. Flags,
M	LOBRUTO	William No-Middle-Initial Slocum.
M	WILLY	Yes sir.
M	LOBRUTO	Sit. Eighty-four-percent conviction rate. That's remarkable.
M	WILLY	Thank you.
M	LOBRUTO	With a case load thirty percent higher than any other first-year DDA. Of course - you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together. Willy considers his options. He always does.
M	WILLY	I offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions. They couldn't handle their workloads, and I prefer not to lose. Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it.
M	LOBRUTO	You're going to need a middle initial. Sir?
M	LOBRUTO	You're going to Wooton Sims.
M	WILLY	In two weeks.
M	LOBRUTO	You'll be able to afford a better suit. But those guys all play squash and have middle names. They go in for the mother's maiden name a lot. Beat. Willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but
M	WILLY	My mother didn't have a maiden name. Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy's hard calm.
M	LOBRUTO	So you're a bastard; sometimes I can be a son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong here.
M	WILLY	I didn't work this hard to stay where I belong.
M	LOBRUTO	You're a street-fighter, Willy. You should be in court. We can move you up to better cases.
M	WILLY	I appreciate the offer.
M	LOBRUTO	I didn't think so. Well - you got your litigation experience. Your chops. And your juicy private sector job. Anything else the City of Los Angeles can do for you? Willy's amused. He stands, too. As they shake hands:
M	WILLY	No, I think that's everything - thank you.
M	LOBRUTO	The offer stands. If you get tired of carrying a spear. Willy nods - but Lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes:
M	LOBRUTO	It's an opera joke. Give my regards to Bob. The phone rings and he gives up, frustrated - pushing the - knocking a full cup of take-out coffee on to his chair. Willy freezes. Watching the coffee seep into the fabric.
M	WILLY	Willy Slocum.
M	NORMAN	I've got an Attempted Homicide. Conley caught it last night, but he's hung up in motions with Gardner. Arraignment in Part Seven, at three o'clock.
M	WILLY	Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes.
M	NORMAN	Thank you. What's the temperature? I can't do it.
M	NORMAN	You do still actually work here, Willy, right? I mean, you're still going to be cashing your paycheck for another two weeks and everything?
M	WILLY	Just get somebody else for this one.
M	NORMAN	Everybody's booked up. Look: it's not going to trial. There's a weapon with prints, and a confession. Take the arraignment and wait for the plea.
M	WILLY	A real confession?
M	NORMAN	Spontaneous and signed. Come on, Willy. Willy sighs. Looking down at his coffee-soaked suit.
M	WILLY	Okay. Here's the problem.
M	NORMAN	You know - I really wish I was going to see this. He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handful of - passing Nunally, in the back row. Nunally is making a good Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who dresses for court.
M	WILLY	Sorry, your honor. Long story. Willy, hurrying to Prosecution Table, barely glances at the - but Crawford, sitting beside his PUBLIC DEFENDER in an
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Grapevine has it the punch-line is Wooton Sims.
M	WILLY	Yes, ma'am.
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Good for you, double-oh-seven. Let's see what public service is offering you by way of a send-off:
M	BAILIFF	The State of California Versus Thomas Crawford. The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to
F	JUDGE	Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code: Attempted Murder, with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code section 245 dash A2, with Great Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07. Do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of rights? (sotto) I do. But, your honor - You do.
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	And do you wish to enter a plea at this time?
F	CRAWFORD	Not guilty. But I also want to waive my right to counsel, and represent myself. Willy looks up from the file - startled.
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Do you have a problem with your appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?
F	CRAWFORD	No. I just want to do it myself. I believe it's within my rights.
M	P.D.	Your honor, if I could have a moment with my client -
F	CRAWFORD	I'm not your client. Try and keep up, would you? The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record, Mr. Slocum? Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze.
M	WILLY	I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession. I really think Mr. Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea. Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an Crawford nods: you're welcome. Willy turns to the Judge.
M	WILLY	I - can't - this was supposed to be - with a pro se defendant, this is going to drag out for months - and I'm not even going to be here. The People request a continuance to -
F	CRAWFORD	Excuse me? Your honor? I'm willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial. Does that help?
F	JUDGE	You don't need to look out for Mr. Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District Attorney's office can shift another prosecutor to the case -
F	CRAWFORD	No, I like Mr. Slocum. Beat.
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Mr. Slocum? He likes you.
M	WILLY	Terrific.
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Mr. Crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities.
M	WILLY	All due respect, your honor, I'm worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus -
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	I appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum - considering you're making the argument dressed as a game-show host. Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying citizen, entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate the legal system, like everybody else. As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly urge you to retain counsel. Lack of same will not be grounds for appeal.
F	CRAWFORD	I understand. Thank you.
M	JUDGE FELDMAN	Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing? Willy hesitates, irritated. Looks through the file again.
M	WILLY	Sure. Why not. Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar.
M	NUNALLY	You're supposed to be good. Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear
M	WILLY	Is that what I'm supposed to be?
M	NUNALLY	I asked around. You're supposed to be top-notch - but to me it looks like you've got one foot out the door, and you're wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one.
M	WILLY	I'm sorry to...disappoint you. Nunally is silent - frustrated. The concrete walls and
M	NUNALLY	I took Crawford's confession.
M	WILLY	And now you want mine? I'm here to warn you. Take this seriously, because it's serious. This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying in a hospital bed - with brain damage... He struggles to keep himself under control.
M	WILLY	Are you all right?
M	NUNALLY	Are you gonna be on this, or what?
M	WILLY	Yeah. I'm on it. You got a confession. You took the gun out of his hand. It's done.
M	NUNALLY	I'm just - telling you. Is that okay? Or are you too friggin' busy?!
M	WILLY	No. It's okay. Willy waits. Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons.
M	NUNALLY	Forget it. It's a lock. We're good. Put him down. Bury him. Willy nods. Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp. NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his age,
F	NIKKI	Are you a shark? Sorry?
F	NIKKI	You've been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you'd die.
M	WILLY	If I stopped, I'd be standing around with no one to talk to. At which point, death would be a relief.
F	NIKKI	Why don't you talk to Bob? Willy stops walking, getting a little careful.
M	WILLY	"Bob" is talking to the Governor. Do I know you? She puts a hand out, gently amused.
F	NIKKI	Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate, Wooton Sims.
M	WILLY	Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that called, with the invitation.
F	NIKKI	On Bob's orders.
M	WILLY	Listen, I don't...actually know "Bob." I mean, I've only met the man once. Nikki nods, considering this. And him.
F	NIKKI	Interesting. They're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction.
F	NIKKI	You like opera?
M	WILLY	Truth is, I haven't really had that much expos-
F	NIKKI	Neither do I. With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza
F	NIKKI	Bob assigned you to my team. I'll supervise your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you.
M	WILLY	Kind of like a mentor.
F	NIKKI	Kind of like a probation officer. Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make
M	WILLY	Okay.
F	NIKKI	Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred-and-ten-percent performance. But: you get to work on legendary litigation. National, sometimes global, in scope. It's high- stakes. And cut-throat - even within the team. We burn out associates at an astonishing rate.
M	WILLY	You're trying to scare me.
F	NIKKI	Yes.
M	WILLY	You're going to have to try harder. She stops walking. Studying Willy.
F	NIKKI	Can I ask you something personal?
M	WILLY	Sure.
F	NIKKI	Who are you? Willy doesn't answer. Maybe uncertain what she means. Maybe
F	NIKKI	We have a guy in our criminal division, fresh out of Yale, named Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. - which is routine bullshit, so Calvin gets it. Against you. Next thing we know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton, who has never even interviewed a junior associate before - let alone hired one - says you're on my team. Willy weighs his options. Decides to level:
M	WILLY	It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for a deal. I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr. Wooton, I would throw the case. I laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose. Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. Then he did what I had suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him. Your client got the maximum. Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton. Bob. Beat.
F	NIKKI	Wow. You know what's brilliant about that?
M	WILLY	Yes. You didn't actually do anything all that wrong.
M	WILLY	Well - I wasn't entirely honest with Calvin. His cell-phone rings. He ignores it.
F	NIKKI	You gonna get that?
M	WILLY	Everyone I need to talk to is here. They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them.
F	NIKKI	We need to talk about your transition timetable.
M	WILLY	All right.
F	NIKKI	Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He wants you up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday, because we're getting on a plane to Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.
M	WILLY	No problem. She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands:
F	NIKKI	That's catch-up on three years' work - and you haven't closed out your old job yet.
M	WILLY	I'm good at trials. Even by fire. Beat.
F	NIKKI	You know, a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have.
M	WILLY	I'm looking forward to when I can afford the luxury of having some. Nikki sighs, smiles. Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly.
F	NIKKI	I'll have them put the Armstead materials in your new office.
M	WILLY	Thanks. Boss. He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone,
M	MARCHAND	Marchand.
M	WILLY	It's Willy Slocum. What's up?
M	MARCHAND	Your gun in that Palisades shooting is no good.
M	WILLY	How can the gun be "no good"?
M	MARCHAND	It's a perfectly good weapon. A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter. It's just no good as evidence. It's never been fired.
M	WILLY	It's the gun from the scene? Yep. Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford and registered to his wife, about a month ago. Apparently a gift.
M	WILLY	And between the shooting and arrest, this guy was locked inside his house.
M	MARCHAND	Is that a question?
M	WILLY	No, I mean, just: what's the point? Playing games with the gun. He's alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed - it's not like the gun's gonna get him off the hook.
M	MARCHAND	Do you have a question I can answer? Beat. Willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated:
M	WILLY	Look, our weapon is in that house somewhere. Get a team out to search it tomorrow morning.
M	MARCHAND	Ya think?
M	WILLY	Thank you. He shuts the phone. Takes a moment, looking around again at
M	MESSENGER (O.S.)	Slocum? Willy looks up, at a MESSENGER with another file box. Yeah.
M	MESSENGER	Where do you want it?
M	WILLY	The idea here is we're trying to take boxes out - not bring more in.
M	MESSENGER	Is that the idea? Willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the
M	WILLY	Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw- up. I already have these documents. I sent this box: to the Defendant, at County.
M	MESSENGER	I picked up at County. Slip says bring 'em here. Messenger holds out a clipboard. Willy reluctantly signs. Crawford has scrawled NO in red marker across the top sheet. Beat. Disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials. Marchand, supervising, answers his cell-phone:
M	MARCHAND	Marchand.
M	WILLY	Where are we on this gun?
M	MARCHAND	We can't find it, Willy.
M	WILLY	I'm in trial on Monday.
M	MARCHAND	I know. I don't know what to tell you. I'm there now.
M	WILLY	You said you'd get a team out a week ago -
M	MARCHAND	I'm here now. My team has been here twice already. Do you really need it?
M	WILLY	Do I need it?! The weapon?! He takes a second. Sighs, exasperated - but honest:
M	WILLY	I don't know. Probably not. Defendant's a whack-job.
M	MARCHAND	He went pro se, right?
M	WILLY	Yeah. Just when you think they're not really stupid, they defend themselves.
M	MARCHAND	You've got a confession and an airtight bunch of circumstantial. We've gone over this place top-to- bottom three times now, Willy. Willy takes a breath. Thinks it through.
M	WILLY	Yeah, okay. Don't worry about it. Sorry - got a lot going on. Must be rough, figuring out what you're gonna do with all that money.
M	WILLY	Hey, I had to sit through an opera last week.
M	MARCHAND	Oh gee - lemme see if I can express how much sympathy I have: Marchand snaps his phone shut. Willy smiles, hangs up. But then his smile fades, as he
F	CRAWFORD	How's my wife?
M	WILLY	I don't know.
F	CRAWFORD	I heard somewhere, I think it was on N.P.R., that you're supposed to talk to people in a coma. Play their favorite music. Supposedly it reaches them. Willy, now ready, lets Crawford study him.
F	CRAWFORD	You represent Jennifer. The voice of the victim, judicially speaking. But you haven't gone to see her? Not yet.
F	CRAWFORD	Too busy getting up to speed on Armstead Pharmaceutical? Beat.
M	WILLY	I beg your pardon?
F	CRAWFORD	I'm not judging you. I think anyone - coming from...what you came from - then paying your way through East-Okie Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by writing papers for Princeton kids on the internet - my God, it must have eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand dollars in debt, eighty-four percent conviction rate: you deserve this. Willy tries to stay in control.
M	WILLY	What the hell have you been doing.
F	CRAWFORD	I'm permitted the use of a private investigator.
M	WILLY	Not to investigate me!
F	CRAWFORD	Why not? You're investigating me.
M	WILLY	You shot your wife.
F	CRAWFORD	Allegedly. That's how it works, right? If I can't introduce something in court as evidence - it doesn't exist. Legally.
M	WILLY	Look - I don't want to play games with you.
F	CRAWFORD	I'm afraid you have to. Beat. Willy reconstructs his formal cool. Takes some pages
M	WILLY	Is this some form of - communication?
F	CRAWFORD	You sent me a box of papers.
M	WILLY	It's called Discovery. The State has a legal obliga-
F	CRAWFORD	There's nothing in it, Willy. You haven't 'discovered' anything. Have you found the gun? Beat.
M	WILLY	Not yet.
F	CRAWFORD	No. Does it bother you that I call you Willy?
M	WILLY	No. Crawford nods. Pleased. Leans forward.
F	CRAWFORD	I'd like you to consider becoming my lawyer. I'll pay you. A lot of money.
M	WILLY	I'm - prosecuting you.
F	CRAWFORD	Yeah, but I'm offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can.
M	WILLY	Are you out of your mind? CRAWFORD I think - on advice of counsel - I'll decline to answer that one. Willy studies him. Decides: it's an elaborate act. Begins
M	WILLY	I don't need the gun to convict you, by the way.
F	CRAWFORD	She was cheating, you know. Willy looks at him, slightly taken aback. He didn't know; it As he considers whether it makes a difference - he notices
M	WILLY	It doesn't matter what she did...Tom. What you did is a crime.
F	CRAWFORD	Perhaps. But - maybe my so-called peers will look at me and see themselves. Betrayed. Frustrated. Humiliated. And you and I both know, Willy, that people have an infinite capacity for believing in their own innocence.
M	WILLY	Great. Take the stand. Tell your story. I'd appreciate it.
F	CRAWFORD	Not to mention the fact you have no actual evidence connecting me to the crime. Willy smiles, gets up.
M	WILLY	Except your confession. Crawford watches him go to the door.
F	CRAWFORD	My grandfather was an egg farmer. Willy stops, annoyed. Is this gonna be about how you had a rough childhood?
F	CRAWFORD	I used to candle eggs at his farm. You know what that is? You hold an egg up to a light, and look for imperfections. The first time I did it, he told me to put the ones that were cracked or flawed in a bucket - for the bakery. He came back an hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery bucket. He asked me what the hell I was doing. I found a flaw in every single one. Thin places in the shell, minuscule cracks. Look closely enough and you'll find everything has a weak spot...where it can break.
M	WILLY	Looking for mine?
F	CRAWFORD	No, I've found yours.
M	WILLY	Illuminate me. Crawford considers how to put it.
F	CRAWFORD	You're a winner, Willy. Silence. Willy pushes the call-button by the door.
M	WILLY	Huh. Well. Joke's on me then, I guess.
F	CRAWFORD	Yes. It is.
M	WILLY	I'll see you in court, Mr. Crawford. The door unlocks. Crawford winks.
M	PHARMACEUTICAL.	Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits. He
F	NIKKI	Make sure you sign the one with the devil in blood. It's not binding otherwise. He looks up, smiles.
M	WILLY	Just want to be ready for Chicago. I'm all closed-out, downtown. Last trial starts Monday. Beat. Not pleased:
F	NIKKI	You've got a trial Monday?
M	WILLY	Yeah: attempted murder.
F	NIKKI	That gives you three days. You told me - and I told Bob - that you would be ready to hit the ground r-
M	WILLY	The man confessed. And he's pro se.
F	NIKKI	Willy, some but acting as his own lawyer - he could drag it out for months!
M	WILLY	You want to hear his witness list? Nikki nods. Willy is silent. She frowns. No witnesses? Willy leans in, enjoying this part - analyzing, even
M	WILLY	It's kind of clever: this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane. I think he thinks we'll call in the doctors and he can fake 'em out by refusing the defense. He's acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy. Beat. Nikki considers Willy.
F	NIKKI	You're gonna miss being in court, aren't you? He studies her, confident. Gestures to the stacks of
M	WILLY	I'm almost halfway through these. And I think I've already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and Florida. I have to check case law in each state, but it looks good. I'll get the rest done over the long weekend. Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will. He's won her Willy shrugs, grins. In the silence, the impossible
F	NIKKI	You don't go home for Thanksgiving? Slight beat.
M	WILLY	No. She studies him a moment, thoughtful. Careful.
F	NIKKI	If you want - you're welcome at mine. My family's. Really? She nods. Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting
F	NIKKI	I think it would be interesting. Beat.
M	WILLY	Yeah. Okay, thank you.
F	NIKKI	Cool. Beat. She leaves. Willy doesn't go back to work right away.
M	UNIFORM COP	We established a perimeter around the house and then waited for SWAT and the Negotiator. It was strictly by the book.
M	WILLY	So the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots? Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an
M	UNIFORM COP	Maybe ten minutes.
M	WILLY	And when you arrived at the sc- Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad. Looks up - sees
F	CRAWFORD	Sorry. Willy sighs, returns to the Cop.
M	WILLY	When you arrived on the scene, was there a crowd?
M	UNIFORM COP	Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look soon as it started.
M	WILLY	And from what you could ascertain, no one went into or came out of the house until SWAT and the negotiator arrived?
M	UNIFORM COP	Definitely not.
M	WILLY	Thank you. No further questions.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Crawford? Crawford looks up from his drawing.
F	CRAWFORD	What?
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Your witness, Mr. Crawford. Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop.
F	CRAWFORD	No questions for this witness. Willy watches Crawford return diligently to his doodles. Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big - through the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, coming to rest against the back of the skull.
M	WILLY	So this bullet inflicted serious injury?
M	DR. KANG	It inflicted serious and irreparable injury. Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this. He checks a note-
M	WILLY	Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that someone inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill? Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Crawford, you might want to object. The witness can't know your state of mind. Crawford doesn't even look up from his drawing.
F	CRAWFORD	No thank you, your honor. Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug. Turns to
M	KANG	I would say so, yes.
M	WILLY	Thank you, Dr. Kang. Crawford tears off the page, starts another.
M	WILLY	So after you put down your gun, what did Mr. Crawford do? He confessed to shooting his wife.
M	WILLY	He confessed. Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in any way intoxicated, impaired?
M	NUNALLY	No. Not at all. He knew what was going on.
M	WILLY	What did Mr. Crawford say? Nunally looks at Crawford, enjoying the fatal blow:
M	NUNALLY	He said, "I got the gun and I shot my wife. God help me, I shot her in the head. I know it was wrong."
F	CRAWFORD	Objection. Everyone turns, surprised.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	I'm sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you say something? Crawford sets aside his pen for the first time. Looks up.
F	CRAWFORD	Yes. I want to object.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	On what grounds?
F	CRAWFORD	I don't know.
M	WILLY	Your honor -
F	CRAWFORD	I don't know what you'd call it. They - it wasn't the first time, either, but - I don't know the legal term. Why don't you just explain it in layman's terms.
F	CRAWFORD	Fucking the victim. Uproar in the court.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Crawford -
F	CRAWFORD	You said layman's terms -
M	WILLY	Your honor -
F	CRAWFORD	I'm sorry - what would you call it - legally - when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual intercourse with your wife? Utter silence. Willy whirls a look at Nunally. The cop
M	WILLY	Oh - shit.
F	CRAWFORD	I think it's objectionable - maybe I'm wrong.
M	WILLY	Your honor...
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Detective Nunally? Nunally looks down, silent. Shaking his head.
F	CRAWFORD	Rob?
M	WILLY	Your honor, the People request a - Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail - spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking. Chaos.
M	WILLY	He had my witness list. He should have filed to suppress.
F	CRAWFORD	My mistake. Sorry.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Crawford, I warned you about representing yourself.
F	CRAWFORD	What about the fact that it's true? I mean, isn't that the point here: to get to the truth?
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Slocum - is it true?
M	WILLY	I don't know. I only heard about it five minutes ago.
F	CRAWFORD	Put him back on the witness stand if you don't believe me.
M	WILLY	We can't put him back on now! Not after what the jury just saw. Your honor, I told you this would turn into a circus. First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation -
F	CRAWFORD	My Dick has evidence. The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he's truly insane.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Excuse me?
F	CRAWFORD	My investigator. I call him Dick. I guess I should call him as a rebuttal witness? He's got phone records, credit receipts, photographs, videotapes - all documenting the affair. In graphic detail. Dick is good. The Judge looks at Willy. This is bad. Thinking fast:
M	WILLY	Okay - um: I'll stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming ...and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial -
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest.
F	CRAWFORD	Actually, while obtaining my so-called "confession." Willy stares at Crawford, shaken. Understanding the trap.
M	WILLY	No way. Your honor -
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	He's got a point. They were alone in the house. The confession is no good.
M	WILLY	Oh - come on!
F	CRAWFORD	Is this a legal argument? "Oh come on"?
M	WILLY	You want to get into it?! Crawford raises his eyebrows. Awkward silence. Willy takes
M	WILLY	Sorry. He dictated and signed his confession, after that incident. JUDGE ROBINSON In police custody. Arguably, in fear for his life. I'm sorry, Mr. Slocum - it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree.' We have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected by Lieutenant Nunally or by other police officers on the night he was present.
M	WILLY	This is insane!
F	CRAWFORD	It's Biblical, isn't it? The fruit and the tree and -
M	WILLY	He set this up! Don't you see what he's doing?!
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Yes, I do. And I don't like it. But it's done, so we have to deal with it.
F	CRAWFORD	Do you think I could go home today, your honor? With Thanksgiving around the corner -
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Don't push it, Mr. Crawford. What we're going to do is give Mr. Slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence. If he doesn't - then you can go home. That's going to put us into the long weekend. We reconvene Monday morning. Willy just stands there: blind-sided, shell-shocked. A package is on the empty desk. Addressed in red marker. Willy just stands looking at it.
M	WILLY	Willy Slocum.
F	NIKKI	Well - you've gotta admire the cleverness of it. Willy begins cutting open the package as he talks:
M	WILLY	Do I?
M	NIKKI (V.O.)	Come on, Willy - give the devil his due.
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out what that is.
F	NIKKI	Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob on how he wants you to handle this. Has LoBruto tried to take you off the case yet?
M	WILLY	No.
F	NIKKI	Well, he pretty much has to if he's gonna save any face. So here's the strategy: you let him. Willy cautiously lifts the box's flaps - pulls aside tissue A single eggshell. Broken, empty.
M	WILLY	I let him?
M	NIKKI (V.O.)	Yeah, damage control. Stop getting your face on TV. As it is, I had to talk Bob down from cancelling your contract.
M	NIKKI (CONT'D)	But we've got to move fast and get out from under. Otherwise, and I quote: "Stick a fork in this kid's ass and turn him over, he's done."
M	WILLY	I can't just - walk away.
F	NIKKI	Willy: today, you got killed. The issue now is saving your new life. Willy can't take his eyes off Crawford's "gift."
M	WILLY	I guess...that would be the smart way of looking at it.
F	NIKKI	You want to come out and get drunk?
M	WILLY	No. Thank you. I've got some stuff to take care of.
F	NIKKI	All right. Don't beat yourself up.
M	WILLY	I won't. He hangs up. Considering the empty eggshell. But then he District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to
M	LOBRUTO	You don't look into who the victim was sleeping with? Willy burns, ashamed. But unable to admit it.
M	WILLY	He - threw me off. Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime suspect, so he gave us everything - but he made it all radioactive. The night this went down, it was over.
M	LOBRUTO	But you still walked it into court, Willy. We might not have a case...but it didn't have to be a public humiliation for this office and the police department. Silence. Are you taking me off?
M	LOBRUTO	You're leaving anyway.
M	WILLY	I'm starting to get a sense of this guy.
M	LOBRUTO	That's not new evidence.
M	WILLY	I can take him now: he thinks he's smarter than I am.
M	LOBRUTO	It's not about you, Willy.
M	WILLY	Yeah, it is. He made it that way. He likes me.
M	LOBRUTO	What is that - some kind of Oklahoma insult?
M	WILLY	Let me do this. I won't make you look bad. Beat.
M	LOBRUTO	No. You won't. That's what I need to make sure you understand. I remove you now: I'm covered, I took some action. If you go on with this, when you lose - blame has to come down. And it'll come down on you. I'll have to investigate you for improprieties, incompetence - anything I can. In public. I'll hang you out to dry. For the good of this office. Silence.
M	WILLY	If I lose. What?
M	WILLY	You said "when." Lobruto grimaces. He shakes his head. Sighs.
M	LOBRUTO	All right. It's yours. Willy nods. Stubborn. Scared. The sound is low, and Nunally isn't watching. He's sitting A knock on the door "wakes" him. Beat. He sets the gun
M	WILLY	You're not easy to find. I had to call Internal Affairs.
M	NUNALLY	Yeah - they put me on a desk - 'til this gets...sorted out. He uncomfortably watches Willy glance around at the half-
M	NUNALLY	Got home - my wife already took the kids to her folks. Press is all over our front lawn. Friggin' vampires. He falters, haunted by the echo. Willy doesn't notice:
M	WILLY	What the hell were you thinking. You're on the job and you get called to your girlfriend's house - I didn't know it was her house. I'd never been there.
M	WILLY	It was her name!
M	NUNALLY	I didn't know her name! Willy waits. Nunally explains, reluctant to expose himself:
M	NUNALLY	No last names. Her rules. We met at the same hotel room, twice a week - no phone calls, no questions. She didn't want us to know too much about each other. She said it was like...travel in a foreign country. No baggage - from our lives. Just us. Escaping.
M	WILLY	Did you get the feeling she had rules because she had done it before? With other guys?
M	NUNALLY	No. I don't know. Maybe. No. It was all just this...crazy thing. For both of us. It was... real. You know? We didn't expect that, when we started. We didn't know where it was going. I had cheated so many times, I was numb - but she was ...new. And she made me feel like there was - some chance. To change. We were scared. It was like we were afraid to go forward, but we couldn't go back. You always think you have time. To work it out. Or make things right. What was I supposed to do?!
M	WILLY	You were supposed to tell me!
M	NUNALLY	I'm married! I have kids! You thought nobody knew - so maybe you could just walk away clean.
M	NUNALLY	No! I didn't think HE knew! OKAY?! Even - after. I thought it was just - massively fouled-up...bad luck. Like - God - telling me - something. I'm there. My mind is going crazy. I know the confession won't hold if anyone finds out. I thought the guy was a whack!
M	WILLY	Yeah? Well, he's not. Nunally won't look at Willy. He just sits there, numb.
M	WILLY	Is there anything else you can give me. Anything that might get us some evidence. Nunally shakes his head. Willy grimaces. Goes to the door.
M	NUNALLY	I...tried to warn you. Willy stops. Looks back.
M	WILLY	You warned me he was smart. You didn't warn me you were stupid. Nunally winces. Takes it. Willy feels a little badly. Two
M	NUNALLY	How do we get the confession back in?
M	WILLY	We don't.
M	NUNALLY	What are you gonna do? Willy shakes his head. Walks out. - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture - - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof -
M	WILLY	Shake the boxes.
M	DEPUTY	Huh?
M	WILLY	The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And there's a chicken in the freezer. Thaw it out, check inside. The Deputy stares like he's nuts. Willy doesn't blink. The Willy steps out of the front door, because he's going stir- He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff's Dept. black- Nunally, in his parked car, across the street. Willy can't give him any news. So he pretends he didn't see
M	WILLY	The garage? Washer-dryer?
M	MARCHAND	And the tool shed, and the roof, and the H.V.A.C. ducts.
M	WILLY	What about the door frames? The floors?
M	MARCHAND	What did he do: rip open a door frame, hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before SWAT showed up?
M	WILLY	What about the neighbors' property? He could have thrown it over the hedges.
M	MARCHAND	We checked. He might have passed it off to somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice, waiting, out the back. Willy shakes his head, grim. Pacing. WILLY This isn't an accomplice sort of guy. He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg
M	WILLY	This is a...guy who likes to show off. He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the Checks Marchand - who shakes his head.
M	WILLY	You sure?
M	MARCHAND	I'm sure. Willy grimaces. Fuming, relentless:
M	WILLY	It's a physical object. It can't just vanish. We're missing something - some step in the story. He begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the
M	WILLY	The neighbor sees her get home. He's already inside. She lets herself in. A minute or two later: blood-pattern says she's standing over there - he's somewhere around here. Willy stands where Crawford was. Raises a finger-gun.
M	WILLY	Boom. As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell:
M	MARCHAND	But then he carries her back there. Why? Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood: Because he's gonna need time. To confess. When she's alone with the cop. Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood,
M	MARCHAND	Neighbor comes to the door. Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer:
M	WILLY	Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and fires three more rounds: boom-boom- boom.
M	MARCHAND	So everybody knows he's dangerous - and she might still be alive.
M	WILLY	So they'll call the Negotiator. Now he's got about ten minutes. And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his
M	MARCHAND	I'm sorry, Willy. Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means Do you dare stay out? Do you dare go in? Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford - And IF you go in - Should you turn left or right? Or right and three-quarters? Or maybe not quite.
M	WILLY (V.O.)	You can get so confused that you'll start in to race, Down long wiggled roads at break- necking pace No longer really looking for the gun. He's looking for
M	WILLY (V.O.)	And grind on for miles across weirdish wild space, Headed I fear, toward a most useless place. He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin-
M	WILLY (V.O.)	The Waiting Place... For people just waiting. Waiting for a train to go Or a bus to come, or a plane to go Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Or the mail to come, or the rain to go Or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow A high-school yearbook. An old photo album. A teddy bear. Or waiting around for a Yes or No Or waiting for their hair to grow. Everyone is just waiting. Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life.
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Waiting for the fish to bite Or waiting for wind to fly a kite Or waiting around for Friday night Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle Jake Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes
M	WILLY	Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break Or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants Or a wig with curls... Or Another Chance. He stops reading a moment. Watching her: What are you doing? Willy turns. A work-weary RESIDENT comes past him to check
M	WILLY	I heard it might - help - if somebody talked to her.
M	RESIDENT	Who told you that?
M	WILLY	The man who shot her. The RESIDENT looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable.
M	WILLY	Is there any chance...she might come out of this?
M	RESIDENT	Are you a member of the family?
M	WILLY	Sorry. I'm with the District Attorney's office. We don't have any other witnesses.
M	RESIDENT	This woman had a bullet plow through her brain.
M	WILLY	I know. But you hear about people waking up from comas. After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up. You hear stuff like that all the time.
M	RESIDENT	You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too. All the time.
M	WILLY	It's not impossible, though. Is it? I mean - why else are you keeping her like this? Beat. The Resident sighs.
M	RESIDENT	No. It's not impossible. But even if she did, she might not remember how to talk - let alone anything about how she was shot.
M	WILLY	When I was here alone before, she moved a little.
M	RESIDENT	Are you just going to keep asking the same question in different ways until you hear the answer you want? Beat. That's how it works with the law.
M	RESIDENT	I knew I should have gone to law school. Willy watches the Resident go out. Then he looks back down
M	WILLY	So this is all exactly how he left it.
M	TINA	Yes. Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites,
M	WILLY	And he was - distraught.
M	TINA	He was drinking. The past few weeks.
M	WILLY	But he was working on this. He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device. Tools laid
M	WILLY	All distraught and everything. It's not evidence.
M	TINA	Do you want coffee. He said I should ask. Willy turns, a little rattled. Beat.
M	WILLY	Tell him I said no thank you.
M	WILLY	How long do you keep the tapes?
M	ASSISTANT MANAGER	A month. Willy considers it. He's got nothing else to try.
M	WILLY	Can I get a copy of October 9th?
M	ASSISTANT MANAGER	I'll have it for you Friday.
M	WILLY	I'm kind of under the gun here.
M	ASSISTANT MANAGER	We're short-staffed tonight and tomorrow. Beat. Seeing Willy's confusion:
M	ASSISTANT MANAGER	Thanksgiving? Willy nods, trying to pretend he hasn't forgotten:
M	WILLY	Right. Okay. JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart-
F	GARDNER	White or dark, Willy?
M	WILLY	Anything is fine, your honor.
F	GARDNER	I'm off-duty, you can call me Lew. While Gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it:
M	WILLY	So - is everyone in this family involved in the law?
M	SANDRA	Well, Nikki's not.
F	NIKKI	Ha ha. Burton's a counsel for Sierra Club, and Sandra's ACLU - so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time, because I can buy and sell them.
M	SANDRA	We're not actually for sale, Nick. Nikki gives Willy a did-I-tell-you? look.
F	GARDNER	Nicole decided early-on that black sheep was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from her siblings.
F	NIKKI	You know of any other family in America where the corporate lawyer who's going to make partner by thirty- five is the "black sheep"?
F	GARDNER	Well - you may be lost beyond recovery, but maybe we can still convince Willy that defending giant corporations against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills.
M	WILLY	I don't think so, sir. It's where the money is.
F	GARDNER	I believe that phrase refers to banks. And it was coined by a thief. Beat. Willy remains polite, but won't back down.
M	WILLY	Times have changed.
F	NIKKI	You don't have to do this.
M	WILLY	I don't mind; I get this kind of thing now and then. Almost always from people with money.
F	GARDNER	Appearances can be deceiving, Willy. I grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I promise you I saw my share of hard times. Willy considers his options.
M	WILLY	My mom OD'd fairly frequently, so they put me in a Group Home. My younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty-five-to-life. Awkward silence.
F	GARDNER	You win. Beat. Willy looks down, begins to eat again.
M	WILLY	I usually do.
F	GARDNER	Yes. I see that.
M	BURTON	I don't know if you will against the wife-shooter, though. The click of silverware.
M	SANDRA	Whoops.
F	NIKKI	Nice, Burton. Beat. Willy looks up at Burton, steady. Shrugs.
M	WILLY	It's not over 'til it's over.
M	BURTON	That looked pretty over.
F	NIKKI	Anyway, Willy's been taken off the case.
F	GARDNER	It might not seem like it now, but that's a blessing in disguise, Willy. Willy nods. Beat. To Nikki, uncomfortable:
M	WILLY	I wasn't. Nikki looks at Willy.
F	NIKKI	What? Taken off.
F	NIKKI	That...doesn't make any sense. Lobruto has to do some kind of damage control -
M	WILLY	I asked him not to. Silence. Nikki is staring at him. Angry.
F	NIKKI	You are really stupid, did you know that? Willy doesn't know how to handle this; everyone else tries to
M	WILLY	I'm - getting new evidence -
F	NIKKI	Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh, that's right - they open early the day after Thanksgiving. You're gonna be fine!
M	WILLY	Did it ever occur to you I might be good enough to still win?!
F	NIKKI	Who cares?! Win what?
M	WILLY	The man shot his -
F	NIKKI	You wanted corporate, right?! You wanted to play in the big leagues?!
M	WILLY	Yeah, I'm just -
F	NIKKI	You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh-
M	WILLY	Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk about this here?! Nikki stops. Refusing to look around. Ashamed at losing
F	NIKKI	Fine.
M	WILLY	Thank you. Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down
F	NIKKI	I need to talk with you. She gets up and walks out of the room. With an awkward
M	WILLY	Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you -
F	NIKKI	Did you hear me, when I said Bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke?! Did you hear me say I went out on a limb to convince him -
M	WILLY	Wouldn't it be better than damage control if I actually turn it around?
F	NIKKI	And what if you don't? Willy has no answer. He doesn't think that way. And she
F	NIKKI	You don't get it at all, do you?! You pulled a stunt to get yourself this job. Fine: you're a hot-shot! Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots. Because you don't win. The firm wins. Bob wins. And you just put yourself head-to-head in conflict with Bob. Silence. Shaken:
M	WILLY	What am I supposed to do?
F	NIKKI	We told the man you're getting on a plane to Chicago, Tuesday. Painful silence.
M	WILLY	Yeah. Okay. Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The
M	WILLY	I think maybe I'm gonna go now.
F	NIKKI	All right. Call if you want. He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously
M	WILLY	I've got some work to do. I need to call a cab. Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet.
F	GARDNER	You know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work? Now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy's heart. We're not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day, and it doesn't get you very far into the country-club locker room - but it's hard to beat when you actually get to do it. Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised. Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters. The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is - and jumps back, startled -
M	WILLY	Shit! - by Nunally, on the other side of the glass.
M	WILLY	The hell are you doing here? Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat
M	NUNALLY	We need to talk. He drinks, then offers the bottle. Willy hesitates, takes
M	NUNALLY	We have to find the gun. Willy winces at the liquor and the remark, hands back the
M	WILLY	Thank you, Professor Einstein. It would also be good to find a couple of eyewitnesses. If one could be the Dalai Lama, it would be even better.
M	NUNALLY	No - Willy: we need to find the gun.
M	WILLY	I've had three different teams here -
M	NUNALLY	He didn't leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs. The gun is here. So we have to find it.
M	WILLY	Well - we can't! You want to move on? Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat - Willy stares down at it. Then at Nunally, who holds up: a
M	NUNALLY	There's a guy in the Evidence Room, owes me a favor. Well - it's not so much a favor as I know stuff about him. He can trade this for the bullet from Jennifer, give us a ballistic match. Beat.
M	WILLY	It's a crime.
M	NUNALLY	So who's gonna get away with a crime - this asshole, or us? Willy sighs. Tosses the gun back.
M	WILLY	Go home.
M	NUNALLY	What else have you got?!
M	WILLY	I'll find a way. Beat.
M	NUNALLY	No you won't. Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely- Walking through the crime again. Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places, Willy stands in the alcove. Looking around. Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bowl Hide in plain sight. He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around. - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table. Marchand surveys it. The bleary end of a long day - sifting
M	MARCHAND	Willy. There's nothing here. Willy has barely slept all weekend. He shakes his head,
M	WILLY	Guns don't just walk out of crime scenes. Marchand waves copies of Crawford's evidence - stills printed
M	MARCHAND	Two months before he shot his wife, this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work. He knew exactly how it would go down - and he didn't leave any loose ends.
M	WILLY	Then what is this: Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white: - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in.
M	WILLY	Hotel surveillance. From that day. He was there. Why? Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder. Shrugs.
M	MARCHAND	Had to see it for himself.
M	WILLY	See what? They were out at the pool.
M	MARCHAND	The unmade bed. Her panties. Man's gonna shoot his wife in the head, he needs to get himself all worked up. Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging Yeah. Worked up. Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on.
M	MARCHAND	Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps - then you start your cushy new life, and you forget all about this one. And then you can lend me money and shit. Willy says nothing. Runs the tape back and then slow-motions Marchand goes out. Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford. He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper - There's a knock on the door. Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a.m. He - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted It's done. In the tool shed: taped to the blade, inside the lawn-mower. Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away. At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him.
F	MONA	You okay?
M	WILLY	Yeah. Maybe. Can I ask you to do something for me this morning?
F	MONA	Sure.
M	WILLY	Write down your cell number. Once my trial is in session, wait outside. I might call - and just hang up. If I do, I want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon.
F	MONA	You found it? Beat.
M	WILLY	I haven't decided yet. Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell,
F	MONA	Oh: this came for you. He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address: Willy grimaces, opens it. Inside are an airline ticket to We only win the favor of the Gods by making a sacrifice See you tomorrow - Nikki He stands in his empty office, considering the ticket and the He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions, - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes Willy meets Nunally's gaze...moving on, giving back nothing. Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with
M	WILLY	So - between the time you heard the first gunshot and called 911, and the time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you had the Crawford house in view?
M	GIFFORD	Yes. I was very concerned about Jennifer. She was a lovely woman.
M	WILLY	No one but Thomas Crawford came in or out?
M	GIFFORD	That's correct.
M	WILLY	Thank you, Mr. Gifford. No further questions.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Crawford? Crawford glances up at the Judge. Then at Gifford, as if
F	CRAWFORD	Did you see the guy run out the back door?
M	GIFFORD	What..."guy"?
F	CRAWFORD	The other guy. The one who shot my wife. Did you see him run out the back of the house, carrying the gun?
M	GIFFORD	I couldn't see the back of the house. I believe...the police went around back when they arrived.
F	CRAWFORD	No further questions. Willy immediately stands:
M	WILLY	Re-direct, your honor. But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages:
F	CRAWFORD	I've also written a motion to dismiss.
M	WILLY	Objection - I'm on re-direct! The Judge hesitates. Both men standing.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?
F	CRAWFORD	The prosecutor doesn't have any actual evidence.
M	WILLY	I'm in the middle of presenting -
F	CRAWFORD	All of his witnesses are going to testify to the same facts: that my wife was shot and that I was, tragically, in the house at the time ...a witness - and, in a way, a victim myself. I'll stipulate to Mr. Slocum's entire witness list right now, a request a directed verdict or dismissal, per California versus Collier, 1982, and the Appellate court decision, v. Watrus, 486.19. Willy stares at Crawford, stunned. As the Judge reluctantly Your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend, Mr. Crawford. While the Judge checks the citations, Crawford glances at Beat. Willy looks down - reaches into his briefcase, moves Looks back up at Crawford. Smiles slightly.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Slocum? Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Have you got any new evidence? Beat.
M	WILLY	May I have a moment, your honor? The Judge nods. Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Slocum? Willy turns back to his briefcase. He breathes. Press the On the tiny screen, a list of names. Selected: MONA/CELL. Crawford studies Willy, curious.
F	CRAWFORD	Your honor? Can we signal the prosecutor from here on planet Earth? Willy's fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad. Press, Next to the cell-phone, the ticket and the note. See you Nunally sits forward. Lobruto is watching intently.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Mr. Slocum? Now or never. Willy won't look up. Nunally stares, agonized. Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up, - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's
M	WILLY	I have no further evidence at this time, your honor. Crawford begins to smile. Lobruto looks down. A buzz rises in the gallery - Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford,
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Motion to dismiss is granted. Uproar. The Judge bangs his gavel -
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	Order! The jury is released, with our apologies - - practically shouting over the chaos - REPORTERS hastily
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	- and the Defendant is free to go. Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head. The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but
F	CRAWFORD	Even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day. He winks, and heads up the aisle. As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of The caller ID reads: WOOTON SIMS. He picks up -
F	NIKKI	Hey, you.
M	WILLY	Hey.
F	NIKKI	What did you think - I wasn't keeping tabs?
M	WILLY	I don't know what I thought. Awkward silence. She tries to get past it:
F	NIKKI	Listen: what do you say I take you out tonight and get you completely trashed? Tomorrow's just a travel da- - there's a gun shot outside the courtroom.
M	WILLY	Hang on - We move with Willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of: Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the Then suddenly Willy looks up - as if he's been called - Willy stares into Crawford's eyes. Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the He's been there a while. But now he speaks.
M	WILLY	Your husband said something...that I can't seem to shake loose of. He said I'm a winner. And he's right. I can't lose. I can't stand people who lose. I may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and...people like you - that maybe I messed up. I don't know if did anything wrong. Or what I should have done. I really don't know, any more...what I'm supposed to do. But I feel like I let you down. Somehow in the...process. And if I did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just - I hope you...have...just, some... Anyway. He feels stupid. Takes a breath. Looking at her pale, He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by He goes to the door, and as he opens it - he looks back. Jennifer's eyes are wide open. She's staring at him. Willy stands, breathless, watching
M	WILLY	She was looking at me.
M	RESIDENT	Yeah, I understand -
M	WILLY	No, she was looking at me. A beam of light slides across it.
M	WILLY	She's reacting. The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin -
M	WILLY	You see?
M	RESIDENT	The normal reflex goes downward. Up indicates brain trauma.
M	WILLY	She's in there. She was looking at me. The Resident sighs. Sympathetic, but plain:
M	RESIDENT	Sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut. They all move - they make sounds, they twitch. You think they're dreaming. But they're not. It's just what's left of the system, sending broken signals.
M	WILLY	Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I. or something? And I want a coma specialist to see her.
M	RESIDENT	You're not authorized to order tes-
M	WILLY	I'll get you authorization. First thing tomorrow. The Resident studies Willy. Reluctantly:
M	RESIDENT	You get the paperwork, I'll do what I can. Willy nods, grateful. As the Resident heads out, Willy sits - seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left
F	CRAWFORD	Mr. Slocum.
M	WILLY	Just...visiting.
F	CRAWFORD	This isn't like you at all.
M	WILLY	No?
F	CRAWFORD	You haven't got anything to gain.
M	WILLY	Oh - right. That's my weak spot. Ever think about what yours might be? Your flaw?
F	CRAWFORD	Of course I have. The truth about me is, Willy...I'm really not very nice. Willy nods. Concealing the ace up his sleeve.
M	WILLY	You sure do know a lot, though. Got everybody all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions. Then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to. Must be kind of...boring. At that point.
F	CRAWFORD	Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy? Imagine it - imagine she was yours. And you knew you were losing her. Imagine days. Weeks. Going through her desk. Her purse. Her closet. Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her shoes. Knowing this is what it will be like. After. Do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living - with her - every day, knowing?
M	WILLY	But you had to, right? You needed time to set it all up...your "crime of passion."
F	CRAWFORD	There are many kinds of passion, Willy.
M	WILLY	Yeah. There are. So - thank you. Crawford frowns. Starting to feel wary. Willy sees it.
M	WILLY	For sharing your wisdom. All your little helpful bits of information. You were right.
F	CRAWFORD	About...?
M	WILLY	Talking to her. Beat. Willy winks. He goes past Crawford and out the doors.
M	WILLY	Hi, I'm just - - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double- - but it stays locked. Willy swipes his card again. No go.
M	WILLY	Excuse me - I'm new, I just started - and there's something wrong with my card. Can you buzz me in?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Who are you here to see?
M	WILLY	I work here. Willy Slocum. I'm new - He stops, realizing how he must look. Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for Nikki Gardner. As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of
M	WILLY	Wait a second - never mind, here she is, thank you. Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through -
M	WILLY	Hey...Bob - Can I talk to you for a second? Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long.
M	WILLY	You let him know what happened last night?
F	NIKKI	I told him.
M	WILLY	Great - who do I work with on it while you're gone?
F	NIKKI	You don't work with anyone.
M	WILLY	Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney and a health-care proxy, he can disconnect her life-support whenever he wants. If we don't move fast - Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear:
F	NIKKI	Jesus, Willy, wake up! It's over! What is wrong with you - it's first year law: that woman could fully recover and swear he shot her and it wouldn't matter. Double jeopardy! You can't take him back into court!
M	WILLY	I told you - we bring a civil suit -
F	NIKKI	You've got no standing.
M	WILLY	It doesn't have to stick: we just need to get a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug! With all the brain-power here, I'm sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor. Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state- appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight him on -
F	NIKKI	What's the point, Willy?
M	WILLY	The point?! Willy stares. Because she's drawn a line in the sand. One
M	WILLY	This man is going to kill his wife.
F	NIKKI	Yeah. What does that have to do with Wooton Sims? Willy just breathes. Vulnerable like we have never seen him He looks across the big reception area, at Wooton and the
F	NIKKI	I warned you.
M	WILLY	No, this is insane.
F	NIKKI	Ding! The elevator. Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and sad:
F	NIKKI	I warned you. She starts for the elevators, Willy following -
M	WILLY	You're not really just gonna let this happen, are you?!
F	NIKKI	Oh I'm supposed to lose my job over your problems?!
M	WILLY	My problems?! Wait a second - this is not about my anything any more - Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - and - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator. The Associate
M	WILLY	This is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a woman's life! The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and As the doors shut across them. Willy doesn't move. Confused, humiliated, frustrated. Beat. Willy holds up his palms.
M	WILLY	Don't bother. I got it. He bangs open the paddle-sign on the stairway door, setting He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over. He - backs up until he's against the concrete wall. Presses DR. LUNT, a senior neurologist, and a HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	What do the doctors say?
M	WILLY	People wake up out of these things.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?
M	WILLY	They said...there's no way to really know. I'm trying to get them to run more tests - but I was there, and I'm telling you.
M	JUDGE ROBINSON	I'm sorry. I have no probable cause to issue a court order against Mr. Crawford - and he's protected agai-
M	PROTECTING HER?!	The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympathetic, He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the Goes back to cooking.
M	WILLY	I'm sorry - but nobody else seems to give a damn that sooner or later this guy is gonna finish what he started. Beat.
M	LOBRUTO	Have you been home at all today, Willy? Willy looks down at himself: he's unshaven, in the same
M	WILLY	No - I've been trying to get some-
M	LOBRUTO	There's a court order out against you.
M	WILLY	What?
M	LOBRUTO	A restraining order. You were at the hospital? Talking to her doctors? Willy nods. Lobruto looks out at the confused, frantic young
M	LOBRUTO	Crawford hired a lawyer this time. They saw Judge Gorman this afternoon.
M	WILLY	Against me.
M	LOBRUTO	You need to stay away from him, and his wife, and the hospital. He can have you arrested if you don't. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I told you how it would go. Willy stares a second, slowly understanding his situation.
M	WILLY	Can you do anything for her? Beat.
M	LOBRUTO	I don't see how. Willy grimaces. But nods. Turns away. The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses. Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets out
M	DR. LUNT	Has Mrs. Crawford been prepared?
M	WILLY	Can I use your fax machine?
F	GARDNER	These have to be served in person.
M	WILLY	Move it if you need to! - running through the automatic doors.
M	NURSE	You just missed her.
M	WILLY	What?
M	NURSE	She just went on up. Willy struggles to control his emotions. Looks down.
M	WILLY	How long ago...did she die?
M	NURSE	What? The roof. Medevac transfer. Out to a long-term care facility up in Santa Barbara. They just left, you can probably still catch 'em. Willy tries to understand her. With growing horror.
M	WILLY	He's - moving her by helicopter?
M	NURSE	Nothing but the best. We hear the surge of a jet engine - - as Willy runs out of the room. Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can As he climbs out of the chopper - - he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who
M	DR. LUNT	This orders him not to take her off life support! He's not! We can't stop the man from -
M	WILLY	Then just hold it - for a couple of hours! Have it inspected! You're talking about a phenomenally expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the man has every right to move his wife!
M	WILLY	She's not gonna get there! He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful.
M	WILLY	This man is a mechanical engineer with expertise in air crashes! He has access to airfields and he knows exactly how to make it look like an accident! You know what he did! You know why she's like this! Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt. Willy stares, stunned. Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster, From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again Willy doesn't know how to react. Slowly, he starts to walk Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford's - the Med Tech secures the door, the Pilot turns to face The Med Tech, adjusting Jennifer's portable ventilator. - and the white foaming edge of the Pacific.
M	WILLY	Why are we going out over the ocean?
M	PILOT	Less traffic. Willy looks at Crawford. Then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him Willy unbuckles his seat-belt, lurches toward the Pilot -
M	WILLY	We have to turn back!
M	PILOT	Get in your seat!
M	WILLY	He's doing something - we have to turn back!
M	PILOT	Who's doing something? Willy points to Crawford, who's just sitting there -
M	WILLY	He is! You have to get us DOWN!
M	PILOT	Get back in your goddamn seat!
F	CRAWFORD	Willy, I'm not doing anything. Everyone can see that.
M	WILLY	I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK! He's DOING SOMETH- An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator.
M	WILLY	What's happening?!
M	MED TECH	I don't know - I'm - there's a - malfunction - - Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his Crawford almost smiles. The Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires -
M	MED TECH	I can't do anything with this, up here. The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech's
F	CRAWFORD	She's D.N.R. The Med Tech looks up - startled. Confused.
M	WILLY	What is it?
F	CRAWFORD	Check. Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his
M	WILLY	What? The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared.
M	MED TECH	She's Do Not Resuscitate. Willy turns on Crawford. He shrugs.
F	CRAWFORD	It's in her living will. The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed.
M	MED TECH	She's D.N.R. She signed it.
M	WILLY	There's a restraining order - she's protected - I'm authorizing you to do it! The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain -
F	CRAWFORD	No extraordinary measures. Unless your court order specifies contravening her living will. But I don't think it would. I think you got one that forbids me from disconn- Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med
M	WILLY	Wait! WAIT - LOOK! Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked -
M	WILLY	Yes. Yes. Willy whirls around to Crawford. Who's frowning.
M	WILLY	You messed up. With all your plans and games. Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of
M	WILLY	Shhhh. It's okay. It's all right. - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand. Silent
M	WILLY	You're gonna be okay? She squeezes his hand. Very weakly. Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch.
M	WILLY	Jennifer? Hang on. Something sad in her wordless gaze. As it starts to fade. Jennifer?! JENNIFER?! She's slipping. Her eyes gone empty. Her hand becoming
M	WILLY	No. Come on, Jennifer. Fight back. Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them -
M	WILLY	Don't let go. But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically.
F	CRAWFORD	You pushed it, Willy. We didn't have to be here. But now you're my witness. You saw: I didn't touch anything, I didn't do anything. The machine went down. Anybody asks - you'll have to tell them. What you saw. That's really kind of perfect, isn't it? Willy stares into his eyes. Cold. Then he looks away. Out Willy is packing. He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt. As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the
M	LOBRUTO	You're not answering your phone. Beat.
M	WILLY	That's kind of an answer in itself, isn't it? Willy heads back in, starts to pack again.
M	LOBRUTO	Where are you headed?
M	WILLY	Haven't decided yet. Just someplace else. Lobruto nods. Willy packs.
M	LOBRUTO	I shouldn't have let it get so far out of control. We all lose, Willy.
M	WILLY	Yep.
M	LOBRUTO	We just have to live with that, and keep fighting the good fight.
M	WILLY	That's not what I was doing.
M	LOBRUTO	You belong in a courtroom. Willy packs, thinking about that. Shakes his head.
M	WILLY	I need to - get to know myself better.
M	LOBRUTO	You're a good lawyer. All this may have even made you a better lawyer. Don't waste it. Willy turns on him - angry, confused, bitter: I didn't just lose a case! I let a man get away with murder. Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain. Shrugs, accepts the Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing.
M	LOBRUTO	If it makes you feel any better - technically, you let a man get away with attempted murder. Willy doesn't respond. Keeps packing. Lobruto goes out. After a moment, Willy stops. Looking up. Something turning
M	WILLY	His wife is dead! Lobruto turns. Uncertain what Willy is getting at.
M	WILLY	We can still get him. We can take him back to court.
M	LOBRUTO	Willy... Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent:
M	WILLY	Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We bring a new charge - of homicide.
M	LOBRUTO	Willy - what happened to you, on the helicopter - we don't even know if we could prove - No: he shot her and she died. The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her - doesn't matter. He fired a gun and caused her death, and that's murder. If he can twist the law around - then so can we. Lobruto thinks it out. Wary.
M	LOBRUTO	A second indictment on the same incident?
M	WILLY	A man burns down a house; we charge him with arson. There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital, they die. We'd charge him with murder. Right? Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now. Impressed
M	LOBRUTO	All your evidence is still toxic. The confession, the arrest - it's all still inadmissible. Willy grimaces. Looks down. Thinking, intense.
M	LOBRUTO	I'm sorry, Willy. It was a good idea, but -
M	WILLY	I'll get something new.
M	LOBRUTO	How? Willy looks up at him. Calm now.
M	WILLY	You don't want to know.
M	LOBRUTO	Willy, you can't - I don't work for you. Right? Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back
M	LOBRUTO	Don't do anything crazy.
M	WILLY	What else have we got left? Willy disappears inside. - Willy is standing in his doorway.
M	WILLY	I need a favor.
F	CRAWFORD	These are from that thing at the courthouse, right?
M	WILLY	Uh-huh. The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny - when a French door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair
F	CRAWFORD	Very dramatic. Willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall.
M	WILLY	You ain't seen nothin' yet. He presses the POLICE emergency button, then turns to
M	WILLY	I want the gun.
F	CRAWFORD	Why? You've already got one.
M	WILLY	I want the gun you shot your wife with. Now. Crawford doesn't move. Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford's face.
M	WILLY	One way or another, I'm going to see to it you receive justice tonight. Crawford studies Willy.
F	CRAWFORD	You're serious, aren't you.
M	WILLY	Oh, yes.
F	CRAWFORD	Willy. You got religion, didn't you?! You care. That's...priceless. He laughs. Willy keeps the gun aimed at him. No, it's very sweet. Really.
M	WILLY	Gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute. Crawford nods. Considering the game. Unruffled.
F	CRAWFORD	Getting it like this: is that going to hold up in court?
M	WILLY	I don't work for the D.A. any more. I'm just a guy who broke into your house. When the police arrest me - they'll inventory anything in my possession. If that happens to be crucial evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky. Silence. Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of
F	CRAWFORD	It takes a very special kind of person to look right into someone's eyes and pull the trigger. It takes a unique kind of strength.
M	WILLY	I guess you'd know that.
F	CRAWFORD	Yes. I would. Willy cocks the gun. Crawford shakes his head. Eyes on Willy.
F	CRAWFORD	I don't think so. Willy doesn't lower the gun. But he doesn't pull the
M	WILLY	You don't know me.
F	CRAWFORD	No? Beat. Crawford smiles slightly.
F	CRAWFORD	Then I'm in for a - rude awakening. Willy glares over the gun. Crawford shrugs.
F	CRAWFORD	Tick-tock. Willy's angry. Frustrated. Trapped. His bluff called. Refusing to back down.
F	CRAWFORD	Where did you even get yourself a gun?
M	WILLY	It's Nunally's. Crawford is thrown by this - but conceals it well.
F	CRAWFORD	Nunally's. Really. Willy grimaces, over the gun still aimed at Crawford's face.
M	WILLY	Yeah. Really. He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared. out with - - is starting to seem like his only way out.
M	WILLY	There I was, with a perfectly good weapon just sitting in the evidence warehouse. It would be so easy. With his life already a shambles. With
F	CRAWFORD	Willy. Put it down. I thought you might appreciate the ...irony. Willy's finger tightens on the trigger.
F	CRAWFORD	Willy. Think. And Willy does. Hesitating. Distracted, by a thought. Lowering the gun slightly, looking at it - remembering:
M	WILLY (V.O.)	"A perfectly good...Heckler and Koch nine-millimeter."
F	CRAWFORD	The police will be here very soon.
M	WILLY	The exact same type of gun you bought your wife, a month before. He looks up at Crawford. Getting it.
F	CRAWFORD	If they see you with a gun in your hand - they're not likely to ask a lot of questions. That's why you went to the hotel.
M	WILLY (V.O.)	That's why you went into the room.
M	WILLY	You took his gun. And you left him yours. Crawford replaces Nunally's gun with his own matching pistol,
F	CRAWFORD	I gave it back.
M	WILLY	Yes you did. After you'd used it. Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer -
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Then you told Nunally you'd put it down - if he put down his. Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford,
M	WILLY	That's why you moved her back there - The truth is I could have done it right in front of the man and he wouldn't have noticed. - ignoring Crawford behind him.
F	CRAWFORD	He had...other things on his mind. - as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon, - and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford's And all you had to do was switch the guns back - in the commotion - Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the - and then wait - He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will
M	WILLY (V.O.)	- until Nunally walked the murder weapon right out of the house. A Detective drops Jennifer's gun into an evidence bag -
M	WILLY	Brilliant.
F	CRAWFORD	You know, this is really kind of fun. It's like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter. Willy looks down at the gun in his hand. Thoughtful.
M	WILLY	This caveman's gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life.
F	CRAWFORD	It's still not evidence, Willy. There's no prints left by now. Nothing ties that gun to me. Willy smiles, slow... Enjoying himself, at last. No. That would be true. Except for all those eggs.
F	CRAWFORD	Those what? Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball-
M	WILLY	With all those little cracks and weak places. Like Nunally. Shooting himself, right there in the courthouse. I didn't think he was going to do that. Did you?
F	CRAWFORD	No. Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford:
M	WILLY	I mean, we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later. That was part of your plan, right? Like a bank shot, on a pool table: you kill your wife - and destroy her lover. With one bullet. Well: four bullets, actually. Right? Crawford frowns. Trying to see what Willy's getting at.
M	WILLY	First bullet goes into your wife. Crawford fires at Jennifer -
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention. - and fires three times at the transom.
M	WILLY	Then while you're waiting for the show to begin - you have to reload Nunally's gun. Crawford pushes new bullets into the clip -
M	WILLY (V.O.)	I mean, you don't want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night.
M	WILLY	And I'm betting you didn't worry about fingerprints.
M	Crawford reacts.	CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip.
M	WILLY	I mean, why would you? Nobody's going to be looking at his gun.
M	WILLY	And sooner or later, life goes on, those four incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever.
M	WILLY (V.O.)	Except Nunally only fired one of those bullets. Into himself. - which continues clattering and working, beside him. Which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them - Tom. In this clip.
M	WILLY	Everybody has a weak spot, right? Some place they break. - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room - that misses the bowl. And gives Crawford a wink. Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.
M	THE END
