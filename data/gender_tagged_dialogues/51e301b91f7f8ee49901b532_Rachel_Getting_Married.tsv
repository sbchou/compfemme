M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WALTER	I want my fucking Zippo now! Walter starts yanking at his hair.
F	ROSA	Walter, that is a behavior...
M	WALTER	Fuck you!
F	ROSA	And you are making a choice. Her cell phone rings...
F	ROSA	Hold on...Hello?
M	WALTER	God!
F	KYM	Don't you get it yet, Waldo? She's making a choice not to give you your lighter because you'll torch the Self-Help library again.
M	WALTER	I'm Walter. Kill anybody recently? Run anybody over with a fucking car?
F	ROSA	That them?
F	KYM	Yes. Finally.
M	WALTER	You're not letting her get behind the wheel are you? Are you?
F	ROSA	Walter, you are only responsible for yourself. (To Kym) This is all your stuff?
F	KYM	You know you never gave me your cell number.
F	ROSA	It was a mistake. I'm lucky I didn't get fired. We've discussed this. (She offers her hand) Good luck. Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late
F	KYM	Oh my god. Here you are. I thought you were going to abandon me in rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are half an hour late. I've been standing here with these lunatics. You look so great. Paul offers his hand to Rosa.
M	PAUL	Hello. I'm Paul Buchman.
F	ROSA	I'm Rosa. We met last time you came up.
M	PAUL	Of course, of course.
F	KYM	Let's go, let's go. Where is everybody? CAROL, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car.
F	KYM	Hey Carol. How are ya?
F	CAROL	Hello Kym.
F	KYM	So where's Rachel? Carol, where's Rachel? Kym slides into the back seat as Paul loads the car.
F	CAROL	Getting everything ready at the house.
M	PAUL	There is so much going on at the house I can't tell you. You know your sister's doing all of it herself.
F	KYM	My sister is bending the environment to her will? Really?
M	PAUL	No wedding planners or anything like that. Just her and Sidney and a lot of their friends. She is so thrilled you're here. Is that everything, sweetheart?
F	KYM	Yah. Can we go?
F	CAROL	Is there anyone you want to say goodbye to?
F	KYM	God no.
F	KYM	So are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house? Because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people...
M	PAUL	You weren't in a cell, Kym...
F	KYM	...AND groups groups GROUPS...
M	PAUL	...And nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber room...
F	KYM	...I was looking forward to a little privacy for once.
F	CAROL	The only extra person staying at the house is Emma, who's actually been staying in your old room. But she can move, I guess.
F	KYM	Rachel and Emma. Oh, great. How relaxing. The only two people on the planet less capable of delegating than Hannibal! On the eve of a wedding! Nachtmare.
F	CAROL	Nachtmare?
M	PAUL	It's a nightmare so bad it's in German.
F	KYM	Rachel must be totally freaking out. Is she too tense?...
M	PAUL	She's a wigwam!
F	KYM	...Is she eating? Or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads? Is she hoarding Snickers and Cool Whip under the bed like in high school? She never did put that one to sleep.
M	PAUL	I don't think that that's a problem for her.
F	KYM	No offense, Dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her. I'm kidding. It'll be great to see her. Foodies are the worst, though. They never get it together. There were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. They would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of Mom.
M	PAUL	You'll see her and Andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight.
F	KYM	Can we stop at the 7/11 please? I feel nauseous. I need something to drink.
F	CAROL	I brought you a Diet Coke.
F	KYM	I prefer Pepsi from the fountain. Kym fills her Big Gulp at the fountain and pays at the
M	COUNTER GIRL	I saw you on COPS. Kym appears not to have heard. She pockets her change and
F	KYM	I'll do it, Dad.
M	RACHEL'S VOICE OFF	Can we raise this hem half an inch?
M	EMMA'S VOICE OFF	Yeah, yeah. Here, let me just...
F	KYM	Oh my god, you are just mi-nute!
F	RACHEL	Kymmie!
M	EMMA	You can't smoke in here-- Rachel and Kym squeal and embrace. Rachel is slightly awkward
F	KYM	Ow!
F	RACHEL	I have pins all over me. You look great!
F	KYM	I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat. All the vending machines. Look at you, missy! I'd swear to god you were puking again!
F	RACHEL	Hah!
M	EMMA	Kym!
F	KYM	Emma! No seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're Asian. Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and I won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin.
F	RACHEL	Dad did not say "blow dealers."
F	KYM	I told him I'd just sleep in Ethan's room.
F	RACHEL	You can always shoot up in the tree house.
M	EMMA	Kym, I'm not remotely surprised you're starting your drama already, however it's Rachel's wedding and this week it's about her.
F	KYM	Emma, you still have your tiny core of rage! What a relief.
F	KYM	So are you an actual shrink yet? Even though you're like twelve years old?
M	EMMA	Psychology. Not psychiatry. You know the difference, right? You should prescribe something soothing for Emma. Like Vicodin.
F	RACHEL	I will have my PhD. in a year and a half. And psychologists don't get prescription pads, right Kym?
F	KYM	They do in Guam.
F	RACHEL	Would you please put that out? Emma designed this dress and there's forty-seven yards of it and I'll go up like the Hindenburg. Kym takes a last drag even though she's down to the filter,
F	KYM	Since when are you a designer, Emma?
M	EMMA	A while.
F	RACHEL	She has this great little boutique in Greenwich. She says things like "you need a fabulous jersey pant."
F	KYM	That's so great. I think I heard that. Isn't this your fifth incarnation or something? Weren't you an actress? All the N.E.D.'s in the hospital were actresses...
M	EMMA	N.E.D.s?
F	RACHEL	Non-specified Eating Disorder.
F	KYM	...they were constantly doing leg lifts under the sheets.
F	RACHEL	Angela Paylin is coming to the wedding.
F	KYM	I ate so much cookie dough and did so many whip-its with Angela Paylin.
F	RACHEL	I know. And she confessed to you her secret Elvis Stoyko fantasy. I spied on you.
F	KYM	Oh my god...
M	EMMA	Elvis Stoyko the figure skater?
F	RACHEL	In her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world renowned judge at the Winter Olympics for Men's Figure Skating. And Elvis Stoyko was skating in the finals to "Could It Be Magic" for the gold medal. And just when Barry Manilow is singing "Now/ Now/ Now and hold on fast..." there's this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz...axel...
F	KYM	And he skates over to the judges table, all panting and sweaty, with his spangly Neil Diamond shirt open to the chest...
F	RACHEL	There is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand... and Angela takes it!
F	KYM	To the roar of the crowd and the shock of the Olympic judges! And he pulls her out of her chair, undoes her hair, and they skate as a pair to the rest of the song!
F	RACHEL	And he gets disqualified but he doesn't care!
M	EMMA	Where'd she get the skates from?
F	KYM	I should call her right this second. Is she really coming? Who are all these energetic young people decorating the house?
M	EMMA	She's got everyone she knows pulling elf duty.
F	KYM	What about me? What am I doing? Rachel and Emma exchange a look.
F	KYM	Hello?
F	RACHEL	Well, I think you'll be assisting on floral detail. I want everything all drippy and luxurious and Mom's a little bit tasteful--
F	KYM	--Mom's in charge of flowers?
F	RACHEL	--and I don't want to upset her.
M	EMMA	And you're such a diplomat.
F	KYM	I am. I'm like Kofi Annan. In rehab they said I was the maternal hub of my peer group. I was always the referee for softball.
F	KYM	I was. I was the only one who could convince the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran around the bases.
M	EMMA	It's softball. Someone was chasing them.
F	KYM	Whatever. They have trust issues in the first place. I'm going downstairs to find Olive and get some unconditional love. Kym swans out of the room.
F	KYM	Anyway, I'm doing some lighting. I already got the candles and everything. Rachel and Emma share a look. Forget Mom and me and the fucking flowers.
F	KYM	Speaking of dawgs, when am I going to meet this fiancee of yours anyway?
M	RACHEL VOICE OFF	He went to get stuff with Kieran. They'll be back.
M	PAUL	I'm making hot dogs and hungabungas! Who wants what?!
F	RACHEL	It's too hot!
M	EMMA	I don't eat gluten, Paul!
M	PAUL	What don't you eat?!
M	EMMA	Gluten!
M	PAUL	Where's Kym? Kym appears, down the back stairway, behind Paul, not
F	KYM	Here.
F	RACHEL	Besides I'm in my dress!
M	PAUL	Ooo! Can I see?!
M	RACHEL/EMMA	No!
M	PAUL	Okay, okay!
M	PAUL	Kymmie, what can I make you?
F	KYM	Actually there's a meeting I have to make. And I have to pee in a cup. And register as a general biohazard.
M	PAUL	I'll drive you.
F	KYM	Just tell me which car I should take. Paul doesn't say anything. Carol floats to Paul's side.
F	KYM	Which car? Would you do me a favor, Kymmie...?
F	KYM	I have a license...
M	PAUL	You wouldn't believe my insurance. And I'm not... that comfortable. Could we figure something else out? 15A.
F	KYM	Ow!
F	KYM	Hello? Hello?
F	KYM	Hi. I'm here to pee in a cup.
M	NURSE	She needs to pee in a cup. Someone will be right with you.
F	KYM	Okay. I'm trying to get to a meeting.
M	NURSE	The meetings are over in the other building.
F	KYM	I know that.
M	NURSE	Someone will be right with you. Have a seat. Several people are waiting in chairs. They look at Kym.
F	KYM	Piss!
F	KYM	Shit!
M	ATTRACTIVE GUY	Only once. My dealer. I was really broke. The room breaks up. Kym struggles to rearrange the fallen
M	ATTRACTIVE GUY	Let's see...that was Tuesday...
M	PAUL	Carol, she's here!
F	KYM	Where did you think I was?
M	PAUL	I made you a sandwich, sweetheart! Meatloaf!
F	RACHEL	Kymberly!
F	RACHEL	No. You guys are not getting my design concept. I want every single light to represent a different one night stand during the misspent youth of Kris Kringle before he stopped whoring around and became Santa Claus.
F	SIDNEY	Oh. I thought you said Satan Claus.
M	KIERAN	I thought she said Panty Hose. Or Panda Claws.
M	EMMA	Pandas are endangered.
F	RACHEL	I know. We're having an endangered Panda fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture. Or impaling itself on some bamboo. Kym! This is Sidney Williams, my betrothed. Sidney, meet my sister, Kym.
F	KYM	Oh my god. You're black. Sorry I called him a dawg.
F	RACHEL	That's fine.
F	SIDNEY	No biggie.
F	KYM	You don't look like a record producer. You're supposed to have a hapless lackey next to you with an umbrella.
F	SIDNEY	Usually I do, but Mom's out simonizing my car. Funny, you don't look like Lucifer's Cupbearer.
F	KYM	I got a haircut. Kym gives Emma a look. Emma smiles sweetly.
F	RACHEL	And this is Best Man Kieran.
F	KYM	Hey.
M	KIERAN	Hi there. LATER -- Kym lights up.
M	KIERAN	Well, that was so wrong --
F	KYM	Gee, thanks!
M	KIERAN	No, believe me, that was so lovely, LOVELY! But in the program -- as you know -- and we just heard earlier today in fact --
F	KYM	It is kind of lurid, isn't it? The best man and the maid of honor... furtively slipping off to the coal bin to have it off while the rest of the wedding party labors away at preparations for the big event.
M	KIERAN	I thought...isn't Emma going to be playing that role?
F	KYM	What?
M	KIERAN	"Maid of Honor"?
F	KYM	Oh.
M	KIERAN	I think I heard that was the plan.
F	RACHEL	Isn't the lilac fabulous? You look like a freesia.
F	KYM	I love the grey.
M	EMMA	We're all wearing lilac.
F	KYM	Look at this. I love this. It's like a cloud.
F	KYM	You guys know how I am. I never wear lilac.
M	EMMA	It's good to have a principle. Kym ignores her.
F	RACHEL	You wore a lilac sweater with a cat face on it on the cover of Seventeen Magazine when I was at Fat Camp.
F	KYM	Sure, but I got paid for that and I was on horse tranquilizers. So why aren't I the Maid of Honor? Why is Emma the Maid of Honor?
F	RACHEL	Because. What does that mean?
F	RACHEL	I wasn't entirely sure when you were coming or even if you'd make it. Kym looks sharply at her.
F	RACHEL	I wasn't sure if you'd have time for a fitting.
F	KYM	Bullshit. It's a sari. You take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you. Jesus Christ I've been home one day and I can't get a straight answer out of anybody.
F	RACHEL	What are you talking about?
F	KYM	I'm talking about Dad offering me food every ten seconds...
F	RACHEL	Dad offers Irish Hunger Strikers food every ten seconds.
F	KYM	No. He has to know where I am and what I'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues.
M	EMMA	That's odd.
F	KYM	Shut up.
M	EMMA	Blow me.
F	RACHEL	Oh, leave Dad alone.
F	KYM	I'd love to but he won't let me. I feel him watching me all the time. And Carol and you guys too.
M	EMMA	I know I have nothing better to think about.
F	KYM	Everybody's looking at me like I'm the visiting sociopath. What are you people waiting for me to do? Burn the house down? They both look at her.
F	KYM	That was a mattress fire and it wasn't even at home! It was on a sleep over! God! I should just get HAZMAT tattooed on my forehead for you people.
F	RACHEL	Stop! You're like a harpy. Is being my "Maid of Honor" this important to you? I didn't think you gave a shit.
F	KYM	How could you fucking say that to me?
F	RACHEL	Jesus. Emma!
M	EMMA	What?
F	RACHEL	Emma, would you be horribly offended and hurt if I asked you to step down as... ..."Maid of Honor?"
M	EMMA	Yes.
F	KYM	Now Emma's got another reason to hate me. Like she needed one.
M	EMMA	Is it what you want?
F	RACHEL	Not really.
M	EMMA	Fine. The crown is yours, First Runner Up.
F	KYM	Thank you, Emma. No, thank you.
M	EMMA	It's not about you.
F	KYM	It's about sisterhood.
M	EMMA	Hooray for sisterhood.
F	KYM	Sisterhood conquers all.
F	RACHEL	And bludgeons all and pillages all and leaves all for dead.
F	KYM	So the gray is not an option? 25A.
F	KYM	I don't know anybody at what's obviously the loser end of the table. Can I have your Chana Masala?
F	RACHEL	You've known most of those people since the eighth grade. You always pretend you don't know people.
M	EMMA	Is it because you owe them money?
F	KYM	Where's Mom? Where's our mother? How could she not be here already? I haven't even seen her since I've been home.
F	SIDNEY	She called a few times. She's "running a little late but should be here soon."
F	KYM	
M	EMMA	Kieran would you like some more Saag Paneer?
M	KIERAN	No thanks. Is there any krill?
M	KIERAN	Just kidding.
F	KYM	I can't believe Mom would be late for my release back into the wild.
M	EMMA	And here I was thinking tonight was about Rachel!
F	SIDNEY	Rach, I forgot to tell you, Carol got the helium tanks.
F	KYM	The words "Carol" and "helium" somehow...
F	RACHEL	Aren't there some rules about helium tanks?
F	KYM	She wouldn't have any idea what to do with a helium tank.
F	SIDNEY	Only on public property. I think.
M	KIERAN	Huge liability.
F	KYM	You're a lawyer?
M	KIERAN	Was. For about five minutes.
F	KYM	Say something legal.
M	KIERAN	Tort.
F	KYM	So what do you do now?
M	KIERAN	I help Sidney out with the business side of his stuff.
F	KYM	Sweet.
F	RACHEL	Here's Mom. The girls clamber up. Kym brushes curry off Rachel's shirt. Andrew looks foxy in his Abby-selected Armani, but he has the
F	ABBY	Hello, darling.
F	ABBY	Kym! Did you get my note?
F	ABBY	You look beautiful.
F	KYM	I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat.
F	ABBY	Nonsense. You girls.
M	ANDREW	Hiya Kym. You look great! Hey Rachel!
F	RACHEL	Mom, where have you been? Is everything okay?
F	KYM	Wow. We were wondering if you got the dates scrambled.
F	ABBY	Yes, everything is absolutely fine now. Thank god. What a relief! Now the party can really get started.
F	KYM	So Mom, you look great.
F	ABBY	Darling, can you smoke that in here? 29A.
F	KYM	It's a private party, Mom. How's grandma? Still surly and irascible?
F	ABBY	Oh, you know how she is. She sends her love.
F	KYM	Great. Same.
F	ABBY	Honey, you should really put that out. It's not right. You know that.
F	KYM	Fine.
M	KIERAN	I've known Sidney most of my life. He personifies many of life's grandest cliches, even as he breathes fresh life into most of them. He has never, ever "ceased to amaze me," and only in the best of ways. The magnitude of his artistry and his business acumen are matters of public record and delight. He's been a great friend "through thick and thin," and sometimes it's gotten very, very thin -- but he "stood by me" at all times, so it is my privilege and honor to stand by him on this profound occasion...
F	RACHEL	You're paying for that, Emma.
M	EMMA	Of course. I'd like to make a toast to the happy couple because I want to come visit them in Hawaii. 30A. Sidney what's the name of that place again?
F	SIDNEY	Humuu-humuu Nukku-nukuu...
M	KIERAN	A-Pu-Aa-Aa.
F	KYM	You're moving to Hawaii?
F	RACHEL	Sidney's recording studio is there. Kym, stung, exhales a plume of smoke.
M	EMMA	I've known the bride her entire life. Not biblically, except for that one time we french kissed at Evan Yassky's party in the ninth grade.
F	SIDNEY	Film! I want film! Whoops and hollers.
M	EMMA	Commence embarrassing story.
F	RACHEL	That wasn't it?
M	EMMA	Rach, do you remember the time I was teaching you to drive in the Wagoneer and you sideswiped that taxi driver and knocked off his side mirror?
F	RACHEL	I have no memory of that whatsoever. Do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street?
F	RACHEL	Gotta say no.
M	EMMA	Well I would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror.
M	EMMA	Wait, wait. She actually got the number of one of the E.M.T guys and went out with him. Twice.
F	KYM	Was that the guy with the peroxide hair? Abby, not looking at her daughter, shushes her.
M	EMMA	Anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up with us, Rachel talked him down from his Middle Eastern fury in pretend Farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation.
F	RACHEL	Mahamoud! Such a nice man.
M	EMMA	We were driving so fast! It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but I knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay. So here's to you, my dear, dear friend. A woman who can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home in one piece. Sidney, you are a lucky bastard.
F	SIDNEY	Hear hear.
F	RACHEL	Where? Where?
F	KYM	Relax, it's seltzer. Low giggles. Hello. I'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger of doom for the evening. I want to thank you all for coming and welcome you even though I haven't seen most of you since my latest stretch in the Big House... You all look fabulous. During the twenty minutes I was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush, I actually did participate in the infamous 12 Step program. 12 Steps. Step-ball- change, step-ball-change. I'm still waiting for the change part. Some guests laugh. Sidney grins. Carol, Paul, Rachel, and
M	KYM (CONT'D)	But as they say, relapse is an almost always inevitable component of recovery, God knows I've got high marks in that mode!
M	KYM (CONT'D)	Anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends.
M	KYM (CONT'D)	So I spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget. I had to call this one girl who was, I think, fourteen, but I couldn't talk to her because her Mom took out a restraining order.
M	KYM (CONT'D)	Anyway, I did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so I very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for... Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel. I've been a nightmare and you've been a saint. I'm so damned glad I'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money. (She pauses for a second) Enjoy Hawaii. La Chaim. One down. What's for dessert?
F	KYM	I'm exhausted. Is there any watermelon?
F	CAROL	Let me see.
F	RACHEL	Nice apology.
F	KYM	What?
F	RACHEL	Nice apology.
F	KYM	I was toasting you and I was making amends. It's one of the Steps. It's important.
F	RACHEL	I know what the Steps are.
F	RACHEL	I learned them in school, and I've visited you in various facilities, Kym. Sidney and Emma share a look. Rachel drops the dictionary on the dining room table.
F	KYM	Oh, god. Dad?
F	RACHEL	Amends. Noun. Often followed by 'for'. Offset a disability or frustration by development in another direction. Rachel blinks at her sister.
F	KYM	Yes?
F	RACHEL	You've never said anything to me, that's remotely apologetic. Yet, all of a sudden, at my wedding dinner, in front of everybody, you decide to grace us all with your development?
F	KYM	Christ. I just got here. Carol hands Kym a slice of watermelon.
F	CAROL	Here. Anybody else?
F	RACHEL	"Hey everybody! And guests! Just in case you might be thinking about something else for five minutes, like, I don't know, my sister's wedding-- they just cut me loose! I'm a loose cannon, is that hysterical? Anyone for some rehab humor? Because I'm really fine with acknowledging my disease. And now watch me be really selfless, and weave a lovely blanket apology to my sister for being a tad out of her loop." Rachel giggles.
F	KYM	You're so cynical. Dad, since when has she been this cynical?
M	PAUL	She's making an effort, Rachel.
F	RACHEL	An effort. That's what it was? Because I think she presumes that since everything has always revolved around her disease, everything else is going to revolve around her recovery. That's what I think.
M	PAUL	Rachel. She just got home.
F	RACHEL	Again.
F	KYM	I had no idea you were so angry, doctor.
F	RACHEL	I'm not.
M	PAUL	Kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate. She's uptight about...
F	RACHEL	I'm not uptight, Dad.
M	PAUL	She's meeting Sidney's folks for the first time, there's menus, there's all that live music, you're home, there's a thousand things to worry about.
F	CAROL	Absolutely, a wedding will take it right out of you, boy.
M	PAUL	Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just...
F	KYM	You people need to purge. You people really should go to Nar-Anon or something. I mean it.
F	CAROL	Oh my lord. Kym, we have gone through Nar-Anon, baby. You know that.
F	RACHEL	You people? You mean the people in this room? Your family?
F	KYM	All of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. I can feel it every second. At the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking Salem Witch Trials around here. I might as well be...
M	PAUL	Don't even start...
F	CAROL	Nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them, Kym.
F	KYM	Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it.
M	PAUL	What constant monitoring?
F	KYM	"I'll drive you!" "Carol, she's back!" "Don't sleep here, sleep there." "Here. Eat this." Dad, you're obsessed.
F	RACHEL	Please. That's hardly news. You may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. "Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?" It resuscitates him. It jars him into the moment. Like an alarm.
M	PAUL	That's unfair, Rachel. And completely untrue.
F	RACHEL	And she's even worse! "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but I lost the car again." "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me." "Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but I need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen!"
F	KYM	Gee, Rach, sounds like you have some paternal/sibling issues to work through.
F	RACHEL	Are you kidding? The two of you are like a double helix of crises. In the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues.
M	PAUL	Rachel! It's nice that you're getting your Ph.D-- --Oh god--
M	PAUL	--but don't be patronizing. It's ugly. It doesn't become you. How come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid I should even reference the "boundary thing," even though I actually know what I'm talking about?
F	KYM	Hello? By the way? I'm not in crisis. I haven't been in crisis for a year.
F	RACHEL	You just got out of rehab!
F	KYM	Why is this so difficult for you people to understand? It's like you're not happy unless I'm in some kind of desperate situation. You have no idea what to do with me unless I'm desperate. God. Why am I the only one who's willing to say this stuff?
F	RACHEL	Oh, poor you. You're so much more evolved in your suffering. You know what? Your suffering is not the most important thing in the world to everybody! There are billions and billions and billions of people, in nations all over the world, who never even think about you! Other people have lives! We have lives! I have a life! I'm in school. I'm getting married. I'm...
F	KYM	What?
M	PAUL	What?!! Dead silence. Everyone stares at Rachel. Rachel looks at
F	RACHEL	I'm pregnant.
M	EVERYBODY	Congratulations! Oh my god! Etc!!! Paul hugs Rachel and kisses her hair. Sidney and Kieran hug.
F	KYM	That is so unfair!
M	PAUL	When did you find out?
F	SIDNEY	Roughly about the day before we decided to get married.
F	RACHEL	I can barely believe it myself!
M	PAUL	How long? How much pregnant? Did you tell your mother?
F	RACHEL	We told her at dinner.
F	SIDNEY	She was so happy--
F	KYM	Wait! Stop! You can't just drop that tectonic bit of information into a completely separate conversation, Rachel. You can't do that!
F	RACHEL	Kym, you're going to have a niece!
F	SIDNEY	Or a nephew!
F	KYM	Oh, god. Of course I'm happy for you. But you can't tell me when we're talking like this. It's a total set-up!
F	RACHEL	I am so fucking exhausted.
F	KYM	Dad, will you tell her I'm happy for her?
F	RACHEL	I just...I need to go to bed. Sidney?
F	SIDNEY	Yeah, okay. Great idea. I'm beat too.
F	KYM	You're leaving? In the middle of this conversation?
F	RACHEL	Yes.
M	PAUL	Kymmie, she's pregnant. She's exhausted.
F	KYM	Of course. Fair enough. I'm off to raid the medicine cabinet.
F	SIDNEY	She's not serious?
F	CAROL	Oh, Rachel darling, and Sidney, I couldn't be happier.
F	SIDNEY	She wasn't serious, was she?
M	PAUL	Do either of you want anything? A sandwich? You must be hungry. There's cold Saagwala and a little Aloo Gobi left over?
F	RACHEL	No thanks, Dad. I really am pretty sleepy.
M	PAUL	You're pretty everything! He mushes her face and kisses her cheek. Then he mushes
F	CAROL	Holy cow. What a day. I think I've aged. I mean it. Would you mind if I went to bed, darling?
M	PAUL	Of course not. I'll be up, Carol. I'm just going to load the dishwasher.
F	CAROL	Let me help, it'll be quicker.
M	PAUL	Don't mess with the King.
F	CAROL	Okay,okay. Hands in the air, Carol leaves the room.
M	KIERAN	Wow. That's it for me too, you guys. Good night everybody. Kieran lays a manly, buddy hug on Sidney.
M	KIERAN	Congratulations, man.
F	SIDNEY	Thanks, my friend.
F	RACHEL	I've never been so tired in my life.
F	RACHEL	Dad?
M	PAUL	Yes, sweetheart?
F	RACHEL	I hope it's okay, I told Mom at dinner. About the baby.
M	PAUL	Of course, lamb chop. I'm so happy! I'm going to be a grandpa!
F	RACHEL	I wish Ethan were here.
M	PAUL	I know, sweetheart. Me too.
M	KIERAN'S VOICE OFF	That went well.
F	KYM	That was such a set-up.
M	KIERAN	She probably didn't realize she was doing it.
F	KYM	Ha! She's such an operator. Now I'm the bad guy again. Or still.
M	KIERAN	They're lucky to have you.
F	KYM	Thank you! Otherwise they'd have to pay attention to their own suspicious lives. Nobody actually wants me to actually change, you know. What would they obsess about? I'm like a blessing.
M	KIERAN	No argument from me.
F	KYM	Dad had an actual "Blueprint for Rehabilitative Success" at my last intervention. On graph paper. He goes all out with the response, my dad. KIERAN Not unlike this great nation in which we live.
F	KYM	Meanwhile an ex-heterosexual ex-boy friend of mine actually rang the door once and tells my mother, "Kym is sitting in her apartment? With the shades drawn? Doing all this heroin and cocaine? And I think she's going to, like, die?" And Mom smiles and says "Thank you" like he was speaking in Sanskrit.
M	KIERAN	You can't actually speak in Sanskrit.
F	KYM	Exactly! I nodded out into the poached salmon at Dad's wedding two years ago and he told Carol he thought it was jet lag.
M	KIERAN	I did that in soup once. It made such a mess.
F	RACHEL	Look how exquisite this is. I can't borrow this. What do you carry in here? A vital organ? A tiny spleen?
F	ABBY	Isn't it divine? It was grandma's. She sends her love.
F	RACHEL	I love the color. It's oyster.
F	ABBY	You must promise me you'll stay healthy now, Rachel. You'll eat properly and get a lot of rest?
F	RACHEL	Yes, Mom.
F	ABBY	How are things going at the house? How's Sidney?
F	RACHEL	Fine. And his friend? What's his name?
F	RACHEL	Kieran.
F	ABBY	He seems to be a big hit. Is your sister behaving herself?
F	RACHEL	I'm not exactly sure what that means.
F	ABBY	Well, she needs a lot of acknowledgement.
F	RACHEL	You think?
F	ABBY	Stop. It can't be easy. Everybody knowing her troubles.
F	RACHEL	Mom, she's sold syndication rights to her troubles.
F	ABBY	Stop.
F	RACHEL	Mom, does it bother you at all, Carol doing so much wedding stuff?
F	ABBY	Not at all, darling, I'm thrilled to be providing the flowers. You know how much that means to me. They're going to be exquisite!
F	RACHEL	Yes, I'm sure, and that's so great and so you, but you can do whatever else you want, you know. I'd love it.
F	ABBY	Thank you, my sweetheart. I just know I'd be one of those wedding mothers who goes completely insane about the hors d'oeuvres. Andrew says I shouldn't be allowed near a shrimp puff.
F	RACHEL	Huh.
F	ABBY	There are so many other people for you to worry about. Your sister's home and everybody's there and the bride always ends up keeping everybody else satisfied.
F	RACHEL	You're right.
F	ABBY	But this is going to be the most beautiful wedding ever. And I hope your sister has a wonderful time too...Anyway I'm going to be a grandmother! Hooray!
F	RACHEL	Hooray!
F	ABBY	I'm so excited. I have always wanted to be a grandmother. Even when I was thirty. Here. This ring was grandma's and she wanted you to have it.
F	RACHEL	Is she dead?
F	ABBY	Rachel.
F	RACHEL	It's beautiful. Thanks, Mom. I hope it's a boy.
F	ABBY	As long as it's healthy. Try the ring on. Rachel does.
F	ABBY	You've always had the most beautiful hands.
M	KIERAN	Your hand is on the turf.
F	KYM	What turf?
M	KIERAN	The turf. The table.
F	KYM	So? So we have to do it over now. It was your shot and you get to do it over.
F	KYM	What are you talking about?
M	KIERAN	Don't tell me you didn't know having one hand on the turf makes the play null.
F	KYM	Null. Maybe we should just play Pinball.
M	KIERAN	Sometimes playing next to each other is easier than playing together.
F	KYM	Who told you that?
M	KIERAN	My mom. She runs a pre-school.
F	KYM	What's Hawaii like?
M	KIERAN	You've never been?
F	KYM	Uh uh.
M	KIERAN	It's beautiful. I've got a nice place. My horse lives there.
F	KYM	Most people say "my girlfriend lives there" or "my wife lives there."
M	KIERAN	I live there and so does my horse. He's very possessive. We're working through it.
F	KYM	Have you had him a long time?
M	KIERAN	Yes. I may be a degenerate dope fiend but I love my horse. I don't have a wife or a girlfriend and I've been clean almost seven years. You could just ask, you know. Your sister doesn't ask direct questions either. She's incredibly cryptic.
F	KYM	That's a shrink thing, not a genetic thing.
F	KYM	We were in the park. I was sixteen and I was...I had taken all these Percoset. I was unbelievably high. He had thrown away his shoes- and I was like "Mom's going to kill me" because I had no idea where his shoes were- but he was so happy about it. And he had his red socks and he was running around kicking up the leaves. You know in movies where they show a person's high or whatever and the camera careens all around? It was like that. But fun. You know. We were having so much fun. We were leaping around in huge piles of leaves. He buried me. I buried him in a big pile. I was on baby sitting detail. He was pretending he was a train. So he was charging through the leaf pile, making tracks, you know? I was the caboose. And he kept going "Coal, caboose! Coal caboose!" So it's time to go and we're driving home and he's in his car seat still demanding coal, and I couldn't focus and I drove off the bridge. The car went into the lake. I couldn't get him out of his car seat. He drowned. Paul sees Kieran's rental pull up, grins, and calls to
M	PAUL	Carol, they're back! Carol emerges with a tray of lemonade as the rental is Are you hungry? I made a Salad Nicoise. It's got Tuna!
M	KIERAN	I was just thinking Salad Nicoise!
F	RACHEL	Can we get back to what we were doing, please?
M	PAUL	All right. Where were we? Ah yes...The Rosenzwiegs. Can you please put the Rosenzwiegs somewhere far away from me?
F	RACHEL	They're your friends, Dad.
M	PAUL	They're not my friends. I've just known them my entire life.
F	SIDNEY	Just so you know, my mother expects to be carried in by liveried servants to the triumphant swirls of the harp and seated on a solid gold throne forged by nuns.
F	RACHEL	Really? Because right now I have her shoveling kelp in the laundry room. But I have it as a montage. Kieran and Kym arrive on the porch. Kym settles herself on a
F	KYM	Where are you putting me? In the stockade?
M	PAUL	Kym, stop it. You're at the family table.
F	KYM	Don't put me with Michael and Sandy. 53A.
F	RACHEL	They're not invited.
F	KYM	Sandy never called me back after I sent her an amends e-mail from Milestones. I hate it when people don't meet you half way.
M	PAUL	The family table. With us. Paul moves Kym's "marker" -- the MONOPOLY DOG -- to the Oops. That's nine. I thought you were having tables of eight?
F	RACHEL	I am.
F	KYM	Where are you putting me?
F	RACHEL	I was thinking of putting you with Cookie Puss and the Chicago cousins because they always get really drunk and need wrangling.
F	KYM	Can someone else do it? I was planning on enjoying myself.
F	RACHEL	You're the only one they're afraid of.
F	KYM	Still? God.
M	PAUL	We can move Grandma Rose and her companion. That's actually a great idea. That's all I need. Another reason for Grandma Rose to hate me.
M	PAUL	She doesn't hate you.
F	KYM	She's still mad about that thing at the Rite Aid.
M	PAUL	Nonsense!
F	KYM	Whatever. CLOSE SHOT--
F	RACHEL	Dad, can I show you something in the kitchen?
M	PAUL	Rachel, what is this behavior?
F	RACHEL	I would just like to have a day please.
M	PAUL	Have all the days you want. Nobody is taking your day.
F	RACHEL	Then why are you defending her?
M	PAUL	Defending her from what? Darling, look, no one's defending any body...
F	RACHEL	Why are you protecting her?
M	PAUL	I don't want her to feel like we don't want her.
F	RACHEL	Sometimes I don't want her. It's my fucking wedding, don't you get it? I want my table to be perfect. Paul kisses her on the forehead.
M	PAUL	Stop it. She's your sister. The screen door swings open as Emma, Carol, Sidney, Kieran,
M	PAUL	Okay. Dishes? I'm going to load the dishwasher.
F	SIDNEY	Paul! Paul, listen, I've been thinking about it. I did some preliminary sketches, I'd love to show them to you...
M	KIERAN	He's not kidding.
F	SIDNEY	And I think if you move the salad bowls to the upper tier you can get about 10% more stuff in the dishwasher.
F	CAROL	Hee hee hee. Paul gives him a look. Sidney starts humming PAUL'S
M	PAUL	Sidney, you're a nice young man. You make a lot of money and the world is your oyster. But you don't know shit about loading a dishwasher.
F	SIDNEY	Sir, with all due respect, the mantle has passed. Sidney has his sleeves up and starts to load.
F	KYM	What's the time limit?
F	CAROL	Two minutes.
F	SIDNEY	Are you comfortable with that, sir? I could spot you thirty seconds.
M	PAUL	You young people should all go fuck yourselves.
F	KYM	Dad!
F	CAROL	Ha!
F	SIDNEY	You see Paul, I think your problem lies in lid placement. Inverting the lids and stacking them in the upper level is really for amateurs. It's passe.
M	PAUL	Rachel, you're out of the will.
F	SIDNEY	Observe.
M	PAUL	Clean out this machine please, boy. So I can break out the whup-ass.
M	SIDNEY/KIERAN	He's breakin' out the whup ass! Sidney trash talks from the sidelines.
F	SIDNEY	You know one of the early signs of senile dementia is an obsessive need to organize.
M	PAUL	Rachel, go fetch me my dart gun.
F	SIDNEY	I find it touching but ultimately sad when the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic containers from Zabar's and retire gracefully.
M	PAUL	Kieran, how's my time?
M	KIERAN	You have twenty-five seconds. I need more dishes. You amateur!
F	SIDNEY	What? No way!
M	PAUL	Somebody give me some dishes! Kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to
M	CLOSE ON PAUL	He has a bowl in his hands. We see the bowl is a plastic Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls
M	CLOSE ON RACHEL --	She turns and leaves the kitchen. Sidney follows her. Emma
F	KYM	Mom is handling the flowers?
F	RACHEL	Well, she's growing them and choosing them - but they are being delivered by her people.
F	KYM	Got it. Wow. Nurturing and growing things from the soil. Textbook, right?
F	RACHEL	Kym. Can we talk about the candles for a minute? Because --
F	KYM	Yeah, exactly! Candles and rice paper -- all lit up during the ceremony. It's a way of honoring Ethan, Ethan's... spirit, you know? It will look really nice too, mainly. Millions of little candles all over the place, and one huge rice paper candle - representing Ethan - glowing near the couple. That would be you and Sidney.
F	RACHEL	Oh my god, no. Don't. Just don't. That would kill Dad. And Mom. And me. And everybody. Please, Kym, please please please don't do that.
F	KYM	Geez. It was an IDEA. Lighten up, okay? They do that in Japan or India or someplace, okay?
F	RACHEL	Just drop it, sweetie, okay? Please?
F	KYM	Oh my god - fine! Done! It was nothing, okay. It was just an idea. Just a stupid idea. I was joking, you jerk! Lighten up, Rachel. This is your big weekend. Everything's fine.
F	KYM	Are you getting a manicure? Kym glances back at her magazine to discover one of the
M	STYLIST	You don't remember me, do you? Nooooo.....
M	STYLIST	Rick James' limousine.
F	KYM	Oh. My. God.
M	STYLIST	Yeah. Rachel, nearby, grimaces.
F	KYM	I meant to come back. I swear. I even had...Oh god, what was it?
M	STYLIST	Peanut M&M;'s and Carbona cleaning fluid.
F	KYM	God is punishing me.
M	STYLIST	No, he's blessing me. It's cool: I talked him down.
F	KYM	So, how are ya?
M	STYLIST	I'm okay. You remember we were in the hospital together, right?
F	KYM	We were...at Milestones?
M	STYLIST	No. I didn't go to Milestones. I didn't have the coverage. We were on the same floor at Loeb House. That was before you went to Milestones.
F	KYM	Where did you go after that?
M	STYLIST	My parents' house. Unemployment. It's all about the coverage, right?
M	STYLIST (CONT'D)	I can't believe I'm seeing you again.
F	KYM	I know. It's so weird.
M	STYLIST	Listen. Do you remember that exercise where we all had to write down experiences and pass them anonymously to another person?
F	KYM	"The Human Mirror: Seeing With a Fresh Perspective" Like Secret Santas of despair.
M	STYLIST	I got yours. Kym gives him a quizzical look.
M	STYLIST	You drew poodles in the margins. I know it's supposed to be anonymous and everything, but you were so brave. The way your uncle abused you and your sister, and how it led to your sister's anorexia, and how you stayed up nights when she was down to fifty pounds holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was breathing. I'll never forget reading that, I swear to God.
M	RACHEL'S STYLIST	Do you want a tissue?
M	STYLIST	I found it so profoundly inspirational that you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal. I thank God that you came in here today. I never thought I'd ever have the chance to thank you. It was your strength that gave me the courage to confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around. Rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon. Kym runs
F	KYM	Would you stop?
F	RACHEL	Don't touch me.
F	KYM	Don't you think his perspective might be a little skewed?
F	RACHEL	I never had anorexia. You sure as hell didn't watch over me while I was sleeping and WE DON'T HAVE A
F	KYM	--That we know of!-- SHIT IN ONE FELL SWOOP!...Did you tell them that Dad forced us into a life of prostitution while you were at it?
F	KYM	Ew!... Wait... Rachel yanks open the car door, jumps in.
F	KYM	I wasn't hurting anybody. No one got hurt, Rach. Rachel slams the car door shut.
F	RACHEL	I'm hurt!
F	RACHEL	I hate her.
M	PAUL	You don't hate her.
F	RACHEL	Don't tell me what I don't hate. I hate, hate the lies. She lied in rehab.
M	PAUL	What do you mean she lied?
F	RACHEL	She lied to the people who were working with her. Who were trying to help her. She lies to everybody.
M	PAUL	Where is she now?
F	RACHEL	Where am I now, Dad?
M	KYM'S VOICE OFF	Rachel! Rachel?
M	PAUL	Thank god. In here. Kym comes stomping in. Her foils are still intact.
F	KYM	Thanks for abandoning me. I had to take a taxi!
F	RACHEL	Are you kidding me?
F	KYM	Why would anything I said or didn't say at the hospital hurt you? It wasn't about you!
F	RACHEL	Why not? Why wasn't it about me?
M	PAUL	Rachel...
F	RACHEL	Dad, stop. Why not? I was hopeful. I was on your side. I still am. Do you have any idea what that means? Do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world? There was nothing left. Everybody was just empty. You think they remembered I was alive or needed anything during your... life? And after all that loneliness and Mom and Dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and Dad not even being able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us! Instead of telling the truth about yourself!
F	KYM	God, Rachel...
M	PAUL	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's this all about?
F	RACHEL	Apparently she has a whole history of sexual molestation.
F	CAROL	What?
M	PAUL	Kym, what is your sister saying? Did you say you were sexually molested?
F	KYM	Oh Jesus Christ. Not by you! It was a long time ago!
M	PAUL	Were you?
F	KYM	No!
M	PAUL	Why in god's name would you say something like that?
F	KYM	It was anonymous! It seemed like a good idea at the time. The three on the couch are stunned for a moment.
F	RACHEL	Dad, look at me. I'm right here. I'm telling you that after Ethan died I wanted her to get better or just die...
M	PAUL	And look! She is better!
F	KYM	Nice, Rachel. Thank you.
F	RACHEL	...And Dad, she was lying and she didn't give a shit about the rest of us. Recovery can't work if you lie. She knows that. I was worthless to her. We all meant nothing to her.
F	KYM	You're not worthless. You're my sister. I love you guys. I need you guys, but you don't get to sit around for the rest of my life deciding what I'm supposed to be like. You weren't there. You weren't inside my head when I was fucked up and your certainly not there now. You haven't got a clue what I feel.
F	RACHEL	Kym, you took Ethan for granted. You were high for his life. You were not present for his life. You were high. He was like a pet to you. You drove him off the bridge. And now he's dead.
M	PAUL	It was an accident.
F	KYM	Yes! I was stoned out of my mind! Jesus Christ, who do I have to be now? Mother Theresa? Did I use up all the love I'm allowed for this lifetime because I killed our little brother?
M	PAUL	No, it was an accident!
F	KYM	I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!
M	PAUL	It was an accident. Kym, her hair still in foils, rushes out of the house.
F	ABBY	Hello? Hello Abby. It's Paul.
F	ABBY	Hello Paul.
M	PAUL	Is Kym with you?
F	ABBY	No. Why? Did she go somewhere?
M	PAUL	She left the house about an hour ago.
F	ABBY	To a meeting?
M	PAUL	She and Rachel had an argument.
F	ABBY	Oh, dear. The night before her wedding? What was it about?
M	PAUL	Look, Abby, it doesn't matter. She left the house. She took the car.
F	ABBY	What was the argument about?
M	PAUL	I don't know. They were both getting their hair done... You don't know? Well what were they saying?
M	PAUL	For god's sake Abby! I'm trying to figure out where she went before I call the police!
F	ABBY	Well, last time you called the police looking for her she was upstairs, asleep in the guest room.
M	PAUL	She wasn't asleep, she was unconscious! And I'm glad I called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her up and at least something was being done!
F	ABBY	Paul, I'm trying to help.
M	PAUL	You're trying to dismiss everything!
F	ABBY	She's not a criminal!
M	PAUL	You're disregarding everything I'm saying, and this failure to listen, failure to understand what is right in front of you is exactly why you will never be able...
F	ABBY	Paul!...
M	PAUL	...To help her! Maybe that's not what she needs all the time...
M	PAUL	What?
F	ABBY	I mean..I mean maybe she needs us --
M	PAUL	-- Maybe she needs someone to be watchful and present and in her life!
F	ABBY	-- To trust her --
M	PAUL	She could hurt herself! She could be lying dead in a ditch somewhere!
F	ABBY	All right! All right! Stop it!
M	PAUL	If you hear anything, can I count on you to please call me?
F	ABBY	Can you count on me?...
F	ABBY	Yes Paul, you can count on me to call if I hear anything.
M	PAUL	Okay, then.
F	ABBY	Goodbye.
M	PAUL	Goodbye.
M	PAUL	Abby hasn't heard from her.
F	CAROL	She must feel awful.
M	KIERAN	Excuse me, but when you're trying to get better there's a lot of pressure in rehabs... when someone isn't ready to take responsibility they create something, like an Uncle Stan, to take responsibility until they're ready.
M	PAUL	Well, she's always been creative.
F	CAROL	I just wish we knew where she was.
F	SIDNEY	Paul, Would you like me to go out and look for her? Rachel takes Sidney's hand.
F	CAROL	You're getting married tomorrow. A hundred people will be here.
M	KIERAN	I'll go. I'm...I'll go. Any idea where she might have gone? Everybody looks at Kieran. No one responds. The phone rings.
F	CAROL	It's the caterer.
M	EMMA	I'll take it.
F	KYM	Ahhh....
F	ABBY	You should call your father.
F	KYM	In a minute. I need a glass of water.
F	ABBY	I've made some tea.
F	ABBY	Here darling. Sit down. You look upset.
F	KYM	When will Andrew be back?
F	ABBY	Not too late. He's at a dinner.
F	ABBY	I spoke to grandma today. She sends her love. Is everything all right with the wedding?
F	KYM	Yes.
F	ABBY	Good.
F	KYM	Dad was loading the dishwasher...
F	ABBY	Mmm hmmm...
F	KYM	And I handed him Ethan's bowl with the trains on it by accident. Why did you leave me in charge of him? Abby stops. 74A.
F	KYM	You knew. All of you knew. People told you. I was a junkie. I was a crazy drug addict. I stole from you. I lied to your face. I weighed six pounds and my hair was falling out. I spent every dinner in the bathroom.
F	ABBY	You were sick.
F	KYM	You know what I was. It's not like there weren't any clues. I stayed in my room for days. I passed out all the time. Where were you, Mom! What were you thinking? Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me in charge of him? Abby closes her fists and beats Kym with all her strength.
F	ABBY	You weren't supposed to kill him! You weren't supposed to kill him! Kym curls up protectively and Abby suddenly stops.
F	KYM	Mom? Both women stop, terrified, and look at each other.
F	KYM	Mom?
F	ABBY	Get away!
M	PAUL	...I never thought I'd have two little girls. Two little girls running around with their tummies sticking out in their diapers. They used to bite me on the nose, the two of them. I'd hold both of them in the pool and they'd take turns biting my nose. Ethan never did that. He preferred pinkies. Or knuckles... Kym leans her head against the steering wheel. The horn The house is festooned with peonies and lights and WORKERS VALETS are setting up their car-parking operation (a
M	VALET	Um. Hi.
F	KYM	I'm the Maid of Honor.
M	VALET	Cool.
M	VALET	Hey, I know you. I used to work at the dog grooming place.
M	VALET	Hey, you holding?
M	PAUL	Kymmie?
F	CAROL	Oh my lord...
M	PAUL	Are you all right? They meet at the circular driveway.
F	KYM	I hit Mom.
M	PAUL	Oh my god is she...
F	KYM	Not with the car. We need to get you to a hospital.
F	KYM	I have to get dressed. Look at you! You need to get to a hospital!
F	KYM	Dad! I'm fine.
M	PAUL	You can't just vanish. You can't just leave. You have to call. You always have to call.
F	CAROL	Why don't you go find your sister? She didn't sleep last night waiting for you.
M	EMMA	Oh. My. God.
M	KIERAN	Holy shit. She just showed up. Yes. Thank you. Do you need a doctor?
F	KYM	You sent out the cavalry?
M	KIERAN	For your dad. Mostly for your dad. 80A.
F	KYM	I have to get ready. I have to get dressed.
M	KIERAN	Okay. I'm so glad to see you.
F	RACHEL	Aaaah! Fuck! She is dressed in her Sari and huge gold earrings and looks Seeing her bashed up sister framed in the doorway, Rachel
F	KYM	I hit Mom.
F	RACHEL	With the car?
F	KYM	No. No.
F	RACHEL	You hit Mom? You hit our mother? Kym winces.
F	KYM	Okay.
F	RACHEL	I got it.
F	RACHEL	Can you do this?
F	RACHEL	Okay. The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to
M	JUDGE CASTLE	We're here on this beautiful day...
M	JUDGE CASTLE	Exactly. Everybody cracks up, especially Kym. She laughs a beat longer
F	KYM	Excuse me.
F	SIDNEY	I always just wanted to hear music, and when I met you I heard you. You are the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Thanks for marrying me.
F	SIDNEY	For you. And you...ahem... "She used to work in a diner Never saw a woman look finer I used to order just to watch her float across the floor She grew up in a small town Never put her roots down Daddy always kept movin', so she did too.
M	You know it ain't easy	You got to hold on She was an unknown legend in her time Now she's dressin' two kids Lookin' for a magic kiss She gets the far-away look in her eyes. She rides a Harley-Davidson Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind She's been runnin' half her life The chrome and steel she rides Collidin' with the very air she breathes The air she breathes. The air she breathes.
M	JUDGE CASTLE	On that note, and with the power vested in me by the state of Connecticut and Neil Young, I now pronounce you husband and wife. 84A.
F	SIDNEY	Is this mocha? Or chocolate? He samples the frosting.
M	MRS. WILLIAMS	Baby Boy, let them take the picture.
F	SIDNEY	Okay, Mom.
F	RACHEL	Yeah, Baby Boy. Rachel licks the frosting off Sidney's finger then gives his
F	RACHEL	Can we all do this together?
F	RACHEL	Mom.
F	SIDNEY	Dear God, bless this family and let them always invite us for dinner because my new wife can't boil water or fry an egg. La Chaim.
M	EVERYONE	La Chaim. Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a
F	RACHEL	Friends and family, family and friends! I have an announcement to make! I'm the bride and I'm knocked up! Surprised whooping and hollering.
F	RACHEL	I'm exercising my bridely, knocked up prerogatives and demand that means you too, Mom! Abby smiles. SFX: The Deejay spins an infectious platter (TBD).
F	RACHEL	Oh yay! Dad c'mon. C'mon Dad! This is my favorite song!
M	PAUL	Ooo. Look at me, I'm dancing. She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor.
M	BOB THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR	And how is our little wayward girl?
F	KYM	Fine. I had an accident.
F	ABBY	And, how are you, Bob?
M	BOB	God, never better -- Isaac opened his practice! We're all so glad you made it! I shouldn't be telling you this, but there was actually a pool! Is that hysterical?
M	DISTINGUISHED NEIGHBOR	If you're in need of any legal services...
M	AWKWARD YOUNG GUEST	I don't know if you remember this but you owe me $750.
M	HIP YOUNG GUEST	Are you holding? 87A.
M	INTERESTING YOUNG WOMAN	Kym? Do you remember me?
F	KYM	Sorry...I'm not sure...
M	INTERESTING YOUNG WOMAN	Kym! Angela Paylin!! Rachel and Emma grin madly at each other. ALL EYES ON THE ENTRANCE -- the swimming pool lights Emma, Kayra and Victoria are dancing together screaming until Guests stomping and cheering. The brown, glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the Andrew whispering in Abby's ear. She just stares off. Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed
M	NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL	I can do a handstand!
F	KYM	That sucked.
F	KYM	Ouch. The girl laughs and runs off.
F	KYM	Hi. Where's Mom?
F	RACHEL	Taking a break.
F	KYM	How can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding?
F	RACHEL	Mom doesn't actually participate in things.
F	KYM	And anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day.
F	RACHEL	I was thinking about getting her a cat. Cats are really annoying. At some point you have to deal with them, right? Or they starve to death and piss on your sheets.
F	KYM	It's so nice here. Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room.
M	KIERAN	You can run but you can't hide! Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her,
F	RACHEL	Stop! Stop you fiend! Rachel and Sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way
M	ABBY'S VOICE OFF	Hello?
F	KYM	Hello?
F	RACHEL	Hello? The ceiling light flicks on overhead and Abby enters the
F	RACHEL	Mom!
F	ABBY	Here you are.
F	SIDNEY	Hello Abby. You're lovely. And I'm not looking up your skirt. Kieran is busting a gut not to laugh.
F	ABBY	I've been looking for you all over the place.
M	ANDREW'S VOICE OFF	Abby? Where are you?
F	ABBY	I'm in here.
M	ANDREW	They're bringing the car around.
F	ABBY	All right.
F	RACHEL	You're leaving?
F	ABBY	Darling, I'm exhausted. I had such a marvelous time. Those dancers were so beautiful. But weddings are really for young people. I thought we'd just sneak off and not make a big scene.
F	RACHEL	You could make a little scene.
F	ABBY	And here I am making it. Andrew and I are going to Washington in the morning.
F	KYM	Why are you going to Washington?
F	ABBY	It's the mother of all fund raisers at American. I thought I mentioned it. We're going to stay on about a week - there are lots of meetings. I thought since you two are going away soon... ...and I'm sure you don't want any grown ups around checking up on you...Will you still be here when I get back? Kym doesn't say anything.
F	RACHEL	What about our post-nuptial wedding gossip reconnaissance, Mom?
F	ABBY	Well, can you come by early?
F	RACHEL	Um...
F	ABBY	Of course you don't want to do that. It's your wedding night. You don't want to get up early. I have to get Andrew organized. He's hopeless. And we'll be back in a bit. It was such a lovely wedding, darling. She bends in for a kiss.
F	RACHEL	Wait! I want my mother and my sister! Rachel... Will you call me every day about...? She pats Rachel's tummy.
F	RACHEL	Yes. Of course.
F	ABBY	All right, then.
F	SIDNEY	Goodbye Abby.
F	ABBY	Good bye, Son-in-law. Kym and Rachel watch their mother leave the room.
F	SIDNEY	I saw your mother's underwear. Kym sees Abby and Andrew crossing the front porch through the
F	KYM	I can't find my cigarettes.
M	PAUL	Kymmie. Speak of the devil. You remember Susanna Galeano.
F	KYM	Hi.
F	SUSANNA	Hi Kym.
M	PAUL	Susanna has a public relations firm and she just lost one of her assistants.
F	SUSANNA	Weddings. They're an epidemic. Your father gave me my start about a hundred years ago.
M	PAUL	No, no. Hardly. Well...
F	SUSANNA	We could definitely use an extra body right about now. Have you ever thought about Public Relations?
F	KYM	The public is kind of afraid of me.
M	PAUL	The firm is opening an office right here in town, just in time for the holidays. You could stay right here.
F	SUSANNA	Have you ever thought about P.R. Kym?
M	PAUL	Logistically it's just a dream. You could stay in your old room. I could chauffeur you around. You wouldn't have to worry about rent.
F	KYM	Have you already talked to Carol about me staying here?
M	PAUL	Of course. She's fine about it. You could stay in your old room.
F	SUSANNA	Why don't you give me a call on Monday, okay? She hands Kym a business card and kisses Paul on the cheek.
F	SUSANNA	Goodbye Paul. It was just beautiful. Bye Kym. She leaves.
M	PAUL	Suzy's first rate. P.R. can be fascinating.
F	KYM	You always said it was stupid.
M	PAUL	I meant stupid. Do you want me to hold that for you? You've got no pockets.
F	KYM	I've got it. Thanks, Dad. I'll be right back. Abby turns her head slightly in Kym's direction. The valet pulls up in the car, jumps out.
F	KYM	Oof. You scared me.
M	KIERAN	Making a break for it?
F	KYM	Yeah. I have to go. I was coming to find you. You don't have to slip away without making any noise, you know? I like noise.
F	KYM	I was coming to find you. My ride's outside.
M	KIERAN	...Okay...If you need anything...
F	KYM	If I need to post bond? Kieran hands Kym a folded piece of paper.
M	KIERAN	No. If you ever need anything.
F	KYM	Thank you, Kieran.
M	KIERAN	Maybe you'll come visit me in Hawaii?
F	KYM	That would be nice.
F	KYM	I have to go. Bye.
F	KYM	Dad. Like a ghost, Rachel appears on the porch. Kym looks pained. Paul is still moving around in there. She Rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at She takes in Rosa who meets Rachel's look with a nod.
F	ROSA	Hi.
F	RACHEL	Hi.
F	KYM	Will you tell Dad?
F	KYM	I love your baby!
F	RACHEL	Me too. Kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door
F	KYM	Bye!
