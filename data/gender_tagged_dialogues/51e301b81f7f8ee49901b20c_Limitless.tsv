M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	They found me.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I might have five minutes.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D)	I'll never know how they got past security in a half-billion dollar building.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	They've become sophisticated. Before they couldn't have done this. But now...?
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I will never let them touch me.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	My neighbor must've heard the noise. Opened his door to complain.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	He bought me half a minute. I wish he hadn't. Last thoughts are self- pitying and mine are no exception: the waste. The waste of it all. I mean, how many of us ever know what it is to become... the perfect version of ourselves. I'd come that close. To having an impact on the world.
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on...
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	... was the sidewalk.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Not so long ago, this was me. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I was a writer. Two years after my copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr came to a non-mutual end, I had, in an extraordinary burst of desperate energy, bullshitted my way into my first book contract. This was it:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Now, at last, I was ready to write.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Gearing up, that's all.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Getting psyched. A few days did pass this way... maybe a few months...
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Friends fled.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	And banks became attentive. But just in case you think nothing ever happened to me....
F	LINDY	I don't think I can keep this.
F	EDDIE	Just like that.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just--
F	LINDY	If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able to stand to watch you do this.
F	EDDIE	Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday. If you could just wait, see what he says-
F	LINDY	Stop. You think I don't know what you do all day? I've loved you. I know the good stuff, and I know the shit.
F	EDDIE	And it's all shit to you now?
F	LINDY	You're the one living it. Don't think I don't know it's worse for you.
F	EDDIE	Then you know I could use a friend.
F	LINDY	Don't you dare try that shit on me! CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Well -- what'll work, then?
F	LINDY	I see where it's going. You'll lose your apartment. And then what? You'll move in with me--
F	EDDIE	Not with that enthusiastic invite--
F	LINDY	--And then it'll go on this way, and I'll rag on you, and finally boot you out -- and then what? I mean, have you run the film?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	She knew what was beckoning: the lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Newark. We'd even had sex on it once. And it was a thing to be pitied and avoided.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Lindy. I really thought I had it in me to do something. --I wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there. And now, I, ah... don't think it is. There. --Anything. At all.
F	LINDY	You know what...? I'd have had you move in anyway... if...
F	EDDIE	If, what?
F	LINDY	If it was me you wanted. And not Melissa.
F	EDDIE	I never think about Melissa--!
F	LINDY	I have to get back.
F	EDDIE	--Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday.
F	LINDY	I got it.
F	EDDIE	You got it--?!
F	LINDY	Yeah. I'll have my own assistant. You believe that?
F	EDDIE	You deserve it, Lindy.
F	LINDY	Yeah, thanks. I do. CONTINUED:
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	Oh, please.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	She was right. I was almost 35. No one talks about "potential" at 35. I had missed the on-ramp. Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower bunk of my childhood bedroom... my father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory...
M	VOICE	Eddie. Morgan.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs, is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in- law?
M	VERNON	Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?
F	EDDIE	But who's counting.
M	VERNON	Hey, you!!!
M	VERNON (CONT'D)	Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't you? CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Sedentary job, you know...
M	VERN	So you're still trying to write?
F	EDDIE	As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract. How about you? Still dealing, Vernon?
M	VERNON	Do I look like I'm still dealing?
F	EDDIE	No.
M	VERNON	Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna hear about this book.
F	EDDIE	Nah, I should go--
M	VERN	You can't tell me you're a health nut, now. Not with that tire-
F	EDDIE	Enticing invitation. Thanks.
M	VERN	C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't give `em back.
F	EDDIE	It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern.
M	VERN	When's that ever stopped you?
F	EDDIE	Fuck.
F	EDDIE	So... how's Melissa?
M	VERNON	Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to the beer.
F	EDDIE	I'm making conversation, Vern.
M	VERNON	Well, I don't know how Melissa is.
F	EDDIE	How don't you know? You're her brother.
M	VERNON	I don't see her. She lives upstate now, she's got some kinda internet home sales kinda job... a couple of kids...
F	EDDIE	A couple of kids...
M	FLASH!	
F	EDDIE	Who's the husband?
M	VERNON	What are you, jealous?
F	EDDIE	It's just a question, Vern.
M	VERNON	Walked out on her, if you really want to know. But what do you care? You guys weren't even married six months, were you--? I mean, it was just a coke thing, right?
F	EDDIE	Is that what she said--?! "A coke thing."
M	VERNON	But I wanna know about this book. How's it going?
F	EDDIE	How's it going... Well... I'm behind. I'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know.
M	VERNON	How much have you written of it?
F	EDDIE	Not one fucking word, Vern. CONTINUED:
M	VERNON	Wow. Creative problem, huh?
M	VERNON (CONT'D)	I think I have something that can help you.
F	EDDIE	Oh, no-- no, no, no-
M	VERNON	You don't even know what it is.
F	EDDIE	You're still dealing.
M	VERNON	No -- yeah --will you listen?! This isn't recreational. I've been doing some consulting for a PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY--
F	EDDIE	You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement? Give me a--
M	VERNON	No, this is an exclusive product coming on-stream next year, they've had clinical trials, and it's FDA approved.
F	EDDIE	Okay, what is it?
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	What's in it?
M	VERN	Just take it. Get you over the hump.
F	EDDIE	I'm too old for this, Vernon.
M	VERNON	Look, they've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits, and-- you know how they say you can only access like 20 percent of your brain? Well, what this does--
F	EDDIE	Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good? I smoke too much: my chest is sore. A fucking corpse has more energy than I do, I've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and I'll keel over dead. My life's in the crapper, and I DON'T think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if I do some brand new, shiny designer DRUG!
M	VERN	Gant. When. --I know, but when? Tell him we can't do that. He knows that's out of the question. We absolutely can't do that.
M	VERN (CONT'D)	No, I'm not going to tell him! You tell him -- no, now! Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you here, Eddie. But let's hang out again, have another beer.
M	VERN (CONT'D)	By the way, that's on the house.
F	EDDIE	I don't want it, Vern.
M	VERN	Don't be ungrateful, now. You know how much these things cost?
M	VERN (CONT'D)	Eight hundred bucks a pop.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	All the way home she was back on my mind ... Melissa.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	She'd been so smart. Smarter than anyone around her. And oh, how she loved to provoke people...
F	MELISSA	--Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--!
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I thought, by now, she'd be curing cancer, directing movies, running for the Senate...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	What had happened? Her life made no sense. I mean, I could see a direct, plausible link between this Eddie, broke and buzzed at three o'clock in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	...vomiting on his boss' desk during a presentation... CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	... or stealing his dying Aunt's Percocet.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	But there was no link between my Melissa and this upstate Melissa dumped, cold-calling people from her living room.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	40 long blocks later I was "home."
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Well. There was less than nothing to lose.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I didn't want to see anybody.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Tuesday.
F	VALERIE	Look, enough, okay--?
F	EDDIE	Just tell him-
F	VALERIE	Steve handles the rents. So feed your fucking bullshit to him.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her. I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.
F	VALERIE	--Like the rent's not low enough--!
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon about what this drug would do.
F	VALERIE	You could be a bike messenger and come up with that! CONTINUED: ...What if it was a hallucinogen... oh my God... listening to her rag, if I were tripping...? I'd jump out a fucking window.
F	VALERIE	--Look, I'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- I've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And then... I felt it.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Levels more, layers more, 3-D more... galactically more. But the same. Just the depth and beauty... of clarity.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	What's wrong?
F	VALERIE	W-What?
F	EDDIE	"I was blind but now I see." CONTINUED: You don't like me, and I don't blame you -- you see a schlumpy energy- sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband. You're hoping I'll blow my brains out. But my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it?
F	VALERIE	Look, that's none of your-
F	EDDIE	Something wrong at school?
F	VALERIE	How do you know I'm in school!
F	EDDIE	People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange.
F	VALERIE	Are you some kind of creep? Have you been following me?!
F	EDDIE	I just saw the book--
F	VALERIE	You can only see a corner of it. How did you know?
F	EDDIE	I've seen it before.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	It was true. 12 years ago. In college...
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	...sitting on the couch of a T.A. I was trying to make, waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom... hoping she'd have a condom...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Somehow, my unconscious had served that up... a memory I'd never even recorded. Or was it there the whole time... and all I needed... was the access?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Vern was right. This was no recreational drug.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use.
F	VALERIE	Well, who asked y-
F	EDDIE	Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary, was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	She didn't have a chance.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	We'd really worked on her paper, too. In 45 minutes it was a polished gem. She was pleased.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	One nice little side effect...? I stayed hard for hours. Happy and sore, I returned home. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	... But it couldn't be my home, could it? Who would live like this?
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it, I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious and tidy. What was this -- a drug for people who want to get anal?
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just clear. What I needed to do. And how to do it.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain. No surge of brilliance came up to greet me. I felt thick and stupid -- a shuffling zombie without my coffee and cigarette. In short... CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I was back.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	But something remained.
M	MARK	You're kidding.
F	EDDIE	No.
M	MARK	Words have appeared on paper.
F	EDDIE	Yes.
M	MARK SUTTON	Written by you.
F	EDDIE	Three pages. That's all you have to read. If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading I'll give back the advance.
M	MARK SUTTON'S VOICE	Eddie... give me a call when you get in... (BEEP)
M	MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in... call me... it's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading...
M	MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Okay, how did you do this? I'd, uh, I'd really like to -- shit, just call me the minute you get in, call. Okay? Okay. (BEEP!)
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	But how would I finish? It was "enhanced" Eddie who displayed all that brilliance. Not me. CONTINUED:
M	VERN'S VOICE	Yeah?
F	EDDIE	Vern! It's Eddie.
M	VERN'S VOICE	Bad time, okay--?
F	EDDIE	Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves! I totally chucked the novel I pitched them --I suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in our lifetime -- and I could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck! Okay, I won't talk any more about this if you let me in.
M	VERN	Well, that was fast.
F	EDDIE	WHAT HAP-
M	VERN	Don't ask.
M	VERN (CONT'D)	So, Eddie. I guess you're interested after all. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Yeah. That stuff's amazing.
M	VERNON	It works better if you're already smart.
F	EDDIE	VERN-
M	VERN	You don't want to know.
F	EDDIE	What's... um... what's it called?
M	VERN	It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. And that's the way we want it to stay. The boys in the kitchen are calling it MDT-48.
F	EDDIE	"The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved.
M	VERN	"FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did you really believe that shit?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Okay, so what did we have here? Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere, given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years.
M	VERN	So you want some more of it?
F	EDDIE	Yes. Definitely.
M	VERN	We'll talk about it. But first maybe you can do me a little favor.
F	EDDIE	Uh... sure.
M	VERN	You can see, I'm in no shape to go out right now. Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? And maybe pick me up a little breakfast...?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	It was amazing how quickly it all slotted back into place...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	..the dealer-client dynamic......
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	...the easy sacrificing of dignity for the guaranteed return of a dime bag, or a gram, or in this case a little pill that was going to cost me a month's rent.
F	EDDIE	Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	It took them forever. And the longer I sat there, the clearer I saw... Vern had known whoever had done this. He'd opened the door.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And one guess what they'd been looking for.
F	EDDIE	At least you got your last meal. You never did like to cook... CONTINUED:
M	COP	Let me see your hands.
F	EDDIE	Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called you!
F	EDDIE	... No, ex-wife's brother. I just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know...
M	DETECTIVE	Buy some drugs?
F	EDDIE	Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --
M	DETECTIVE	Okay, fine, what did this guy do?
F	EDDIE	He was -- I don't know, I heard he was sort of an antiques dealer.
M	DETECTIVE	A dealer?
F	EDDIE	Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind of... chairs... sort of curlicue leg kind of things--
M	DETECTIVE	Yeah. That is correct. An Edward Morgan. He's here. CONTINUED:
M	DETECTIVE (CONT'D)	The victim's sister.
F	EDDIE	Melissa?
M	MELISSA'S VOICE	Eddie. You were there? I hadn't heard her voice in 10 years.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Right before. I'd just run into him on the street.
M	MELISSA'S VOICE	God. This is all so weird...
F	EDDIE	Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with-
F	MELISSA	No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more.
F	EDDIE	Not on this line, no.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Melissa... maybe... CONTINUED: Do you want to... meet somewhere, or...?
M	MELISSA'S VOICE	Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay?
F	EDDIE	Then... I'll see you at the funeral.
F	MELISSA	No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay?
F	EDDIE	Okay.
M	MELISSA'S VOICE	Okay.
M	DETECTIVE	Something doesn't jell here.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	But I knew, when his attention wandered to something more pressing, that he was going to let me go. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Only then did it occur to me that someone could have followed me from Vern's apartment.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Probably not. Hopefully not. Worth the risk?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Back on MDT, it was obvious what I should do. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Vern's cash...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	...combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation...
F	EDDIE	...enabled me to finish the book in four days.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	A tablet a day... kept the torpor away. And what I could do with my day... was limitless. I now had cultural appetites. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Learned to read music in a week...
M	EDDIE V.0.	Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	The only cloud was the nagging feeling I was being followed.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Was I? Or did MDT create paranoia?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	The focal point of my existence quickly became... protecting my stash.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Call it a homage.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I had a new, improved game. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	So you're saying that any author who's commandeered adjective status, "Orwellian, Dickensian--"?
M	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	--is prosaic. Yes.
F	EDDIE	Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim-
M	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	OR ZEITGEIST-
F	EDDIE	So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
M	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	I...
F	EDDIE	Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships?
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Fish in a barrel.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And it wasn't just women. I was, for the first time in my life, a presence... Of course, all this seemed to work better with people I didn't know... than with people who knew me...
F	EDDIE	...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock -- Okay, remember when I explained default flops? Did any of that stick? CDS's? CDO's CBO's?
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I quickly returned to the unfamiliar audience.
F	EDDIE	--Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?
M	KEVIN DOYLE	No, no, there are safeguards-- CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	We're wired to overreach -- you look at history, I mean, all the countries that ruled the world? Portugal? With its big, butch navy? All that's left is salt cod and cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they just sit on their dank little island, fussing over their suits. Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're doing pretty well, we've got Poland and France, and a big Swiss bank account -- let's not invade Russia in the winter! Let's go home and pop a beer and live off the interest!
M	KEVIN DOYLE	Yeah. It'll all happen again.
F	EDDIE	Hey, I want in on it!
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	My brain was just pouring this stuff out. Everything I'd ever read, heard, seen, was now organized and available --here it is, here you go..
M	KEVIN DOYLE	You must have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Thank you so much.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	"I must have a portfolio." Very well -- if I must, I must.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	But Vern's cash was low. And it takes cash to make cash...
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	But it takes cash to make cash...
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I'd like to re-negotiate my advance.
M	DUNHAM	Well... sit down, we'll be discussing that.
M	MARK SUTTON	First, ah... I want to apologize, Eddie, if I in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities.
M	MARK SUTTON (CONT'D)	Mr. Dunham has read your pages, and we're prepared to make you what I hope will be a very exciting offer.
M	DUNHAM	What would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road? CONTINUED:
M	DUNHAM (CONT'D)	We think this could be an important title, maybe one in a series. I have to say, you came out of nowhere, but the good ones always DO-
F	EDDIE	This isn't going to work.
M	DUNHAM	What's not going to work? The money?
M	MARK SUTTON	Eddie, we take you very seriously as a writer.
F	EDDIE	Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	No, I mean it, look at the life. Incarceration, loneliness, burrowing down into your own psyche, increasingly insulated from any truth, because you're not in the currents of the world any more, you're rattling around inside the cage of your brain, self- cannibalizing...
M	DUNHAM	You don't think a best-selling author would disagree?
F	EDDIE	Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're "developing a readership," -- for what? So you can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? --Half of them there for the wine and cheese?
M	MARK SUTTON	Yes, but if your goal is to have a VOICE-
F	EDDIE	I don't think any goal will be really achievable, Mark, until I'm sitting on a large pile of cash.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I would have to start very, very small... in a down market. No one was making money. But no one had MDT...
M	DAY TRADER	You've got your quantitive analysis - "quants..." Algorhythms to find minute price discrepancies... you're looking at numbers only. Price and volume patterns...
F	EDDIE	Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars, I made 4000 in a day. It was too slow. Next day: $7,500.00 Still too slow. I needed more capital...
F	EDDIE	Why not?
M	GENNADY	Because I don't see you before. And I don't fucking like you already. Why do I give you 100 thousand dollars?
F	EDDIE	Because I quintupled my money four days in a row.
M	GENNADY	You're lucky.
F	EDDIE	It's not luck.
M	GENNADY	Okay, you tricked their computer, you got some fix on the game. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	You think?
M	GENNADY	So you're a crook.
F	EDDIE	And that's a problem for you because--?
M	GENNADY	You people all get caught.
F	EDDIE	I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened.
M	GENNADY	Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at a day- trading firm...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I'd been upping the dose for over a week. It seemed to cut my learning curve.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	It was instinct. But informed instinct -- instinct based on huge amounts of research, which, thanks to MDT, was conducted more rapidly and comprehensively than anyone at Lafayette Day Trading would ever know...
M	TRADER BEHIND HIM	Why are you buying that? The CEO just got indicted...
F	EDDIE	But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	At the end of the week my brokerage account contained... over a million dollars. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	I'd heard the old metaphors about the stock market: it was a collective nervous system, a global brain, a numerical representation of the will of God...
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Whatever it was, I was jacked in, booted up - my mind was living tissue inside the greater, functioning whole. By the end of the second week I had 2.6 in the bank....
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	The word quickly got out.
M	EDDIE'S MACHINE	You have... 19 messages.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Four job offers... my bank, raising my line of credit... a reporter...
M	FEMALE VOICE	Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your All my new friends.
M	GENNADY'S VOICE	...you stupid shit, I be there Thursday for the money, ten o'clock! CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to sound casual.
M	KEVIN DOYLE'S VOICE	Eddie, I was having drinks with a friend of mine, and... ah, you won't believe this...
F	LINDY	Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
F	EDDIE	Apparently he does.
F	LINDY	But you're not in the finance game. What can you do for Carl Van Loon? Eddie-- I -- Since when do you speak... what happened to you?
F	EDDIE	Self-improvement month. Someone gave me a wake-up call. CONTINUED:
F	LINDY	God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about that.
F	EDDIE	Why? It stuck, didn't it?
F	LINDY	You didn't do all this for me.
F	EDDIE	Who says I didn't? So what -- it's not getting over? Is that it?
F	LINDY	All right, all right -- boy, you are really begging for it.
F	EDDIE	Begging for what.
F	LINDY	"I'm proud of you."
F	EDDIE	Gosh. This is so unexpected.
F	LINDY	I'm actually... more than proud. I'm a little...
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	... intimidated.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Of course, we started up again. My place...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Every place.
F	LINDY	What are you doing, hon?
F	EDDIE	Nothing.
F	LINDY	What, you think somebody's watching?
F	EDDIE	No.
F	LINDY	Is there anything you want to tell me, Eddie? Now's the time.
F	EDDIE	With success comes enemies.
F	LINDY	Old Chinese proverb? CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	No proverb. An inevitability.
F	LINDY	You should sleep. Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	What. What.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Then... I found myself at the door. With no consciousness that I had moved.
F	LINDY	Are you all right?
M	LINDA	When was the last time you ate something?
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	It had been three days.
M	KEVIN	Hey.
M	KEVIN (CONT'D)	He'll be here in ten. Now look, since we have a minute, be warned: Van Loon's mercurial. CONTINUED: One minute your best friend, the next...you're a leper. And he needs direct answers... anything tentative and you've lost him forever. I think we should rehearse a few scenarios..
F	EDDIE	I'm eating, Kevin.
M	KEVIN	You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line HERE-
F	EDDIE	Have a toast point.
M	VAN LOON	So. Eddie Morgan.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	What's your secret?
F	EDDIE	Medication. I'm on special medication.
F	EDDIE	--Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING--
M	PIERCE	Pattern recognition? So that's your snake-oil? Look, if there's one thing we all understand, it's understanding itself --that's how the business works... Pattern recognition. Please.
F	EDDIE	Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze.
M	PIERCE	Until they weren't.
F	EDDIE	Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works.
M	PIERCE	And you have a formula. CONTINUED:
M	KEVIN	Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days--
F	EDDIE	Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
M	PIERCE	Delusions of grandeur.
F	EDDIE	I don't have delusions of grandeur.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I have an actual recipe for grandeur.
M	KEVIN	..and, oh, you know, she's on the wait list... Rosemary's pretty devastated...
M	VAN LOON	My daughter went there. I'll call the school for you.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	Eddie. Ride? CONTINUED:
M	VAN LOON	I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	But you obviously pick your stocks in a way I haven't seen. So tell me. We're thinking of acquiring these companies. Take a few minutes. What's your take on them?
F	EDDIE	But these companies aren't the question, are they?
M	VAN LOON	What do you mean?
F	EDDIE	Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits?
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	--Unless you wanted to play both sides of the fence, control the whole energy enchilada. But these wouldn't get you there in emerging markets. You'd need... CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Whoa, whoa. This must be some big- ass merger you're contemplating.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon Associates...
M	VAN LOON	Have you been talking to somebody-?
F	EDDIE	Carl, it's just rationalization.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Is Hank Atwood going to go for it?
M	VAN LOON	You are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man.
F	EDDIE	Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel.
M	VAN LOON	You realize that if the press got one whisper of -- I can't fucking believe I'm even discussing this--
F	EDDIE	It doesn't matter. It won't come off.
M	VAN LOON	The word "brazen" does not even begin to go there.
F	EDDIE	You'd have to back off Libya.
M	VAN LOON	Why? He's come this far--
F	EDDIE	I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.
M	VAN LOON	You're a gusty little prick, Eddie.
F	EDDIE	Ooh. Now you're curious.
M	VAN LOON	Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think.
F	EDDIE	It's getting late.
M	VAN LOON	All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	And you better be prepared.
F	EDDIE	I'm at your disposal.
M	VAN LOON	You don't really live here...?
F	EDDIE	The Spartans weren't big on amenities.
M	VAN LOON	Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I didn't go in.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	There are moments in life, moments when you know you've crossed a bridge, your old life is over. Van Loon was my bridge. One week, two weeks from now, I would be hobnobbing with ambassadors, flying to Dubai for meetings, blowing off supermodels, vacationing in Medici villas... And that too, was only a bridge...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Suddenly...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	There was another skip. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	How had I gone that last 20 blocks? I got another ten...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	... then...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I was back uptown.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	What bar was this? Was it Harlem...?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Same bar? Different bar? How long had passed...?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And it happened again--
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And again...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	And again...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	And again...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	When it finally stopped, I couldn't account for the last eight hours of my life. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	There was nothing to do but walk home.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	It was my first sleep in two days.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Should I? Would I start "skipping time" again?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Even off MDT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	They were fucking hieroglyphs. CONTINUED:
M	KEVIN	Hello--? Eddie--? What are you talking about?
F	EDDIE	I can't make the meeting, I'm, uh... I'm sick.
M	KEVIN	Yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now -- he'll never give you this chance again!
F	EDDIE	I need to, ah, analyze this data-
M	EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Already I recognized it... the thick tongue, the leaden synapses. It was regular Eddie - the Eddie that, now, was unbearable to be.
M	KEVIN	... Don't you get it?! This is your test--!
F	EDDIE	Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now!
M	KEVIN	And how am I going to look if you don't?
F	EDDIE	Okay, Kevin. Okay. It was my first morning off MDT in a month. The beginnings of a headache was curling around my head like a big fat, greasy python.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	But the time-skips had me scared. My thought -- such as I had one -- was to tap dance with Van Loon until I could find out more about MDT.
M	VAN LOON	What do you know about Hank Atwood?
F	EDDIE	Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado...
M	VAN LOON	Uh-huh. So this is "prepared," Eddie?
F	EDDIE	What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood.
M	VAN LOON	Where was he two years ago? CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Nowhere.
M	VAN LOON	Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar.
F	EDDIE	Yeah, his Great Leap Forward.
M	VAN LOON	The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	...Always picks green technologies, invests in them, and a year later he owns them.
M	ANCHORWOMAN	... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play.
M	VAN LOON	...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game.
M	ANCHORWOMAN	An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene. Anyone with information should contact local law enforcement authorities. --Steve?
M	VAN LOON	You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team.
F	EDDIE	Excuse me.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I couldn't have.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	...or could I?
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	If I could walk, talk, conduct business, seduce a woman, fight-- with no memory... could I kill someone? Was it even me? Who was I?!
M	MELISSA'S VOICE	Hi, Eddie... it's Melissa. Listen, call me back as soon as you-- CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Melissa--?
F	MELISSA	Eddie--?
F	EDDIE	Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere...
F	MELISSA	We're talking now.
F	EDDIE	Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two.
F	MELISSA	You can't see me, Eddie.
F	EDDIE	Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about!
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I realized that there were other people who might know about MDT...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Vernon's other clients.
F	EDDIE	Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Who is this?
F	EDDIE	I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Look... my husband died three days ago.
F	EDDIE	I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I, ah, may I speak to Jerry Brady?
M	MALE VOICE	Jerry's in -- who's this?
F	EDDIE	Uh-- Bill Johnson.
M	MALE VOICE	Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital... ...and he's really sick. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Oh my God. What's wrong with him?
M	MALE VOICE	We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work...
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Of all the people I called, three were dead, and the rest were sick.
M	MAN'S VOICE	Hello...? Hello...?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	In the end, my stupidity saved me. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	What was I dealing with? Who could tell me? I hoped against hope... that Melissa would show.
M	FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)	Eddie...?
F	EDDIE	Melissa...? CONTINUED: You... how are you doing?
F	MELISSA	Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way... You look good.
F	EDDIE	I guess I lost some weight...
F	MELISSA	Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you.
M	MELISSA (CONT'D)	I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on.
F	EDDIE	Since when do you read the Post?
F	MELISSA	These days, the Post's about all I can read.
F	EDDIE	Melissa, what do you mean?
F	MELISSA	I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
F	EDDIE	No.
F	MELISSA	Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug... I was like, down the hatch. And it was amazing. I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and understood it. My work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. My boss started to hate me -- they offered me his job. And then I got scared.
F	EDDIE	Why?
F	MELISSA	I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it.
F	EDDIE	And...?
F	MELISSA	I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day... How much have you been taking, Eddie?
F	EDDIE	A lot.
F	MELISSA	Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch... You're off it right now, aren't you?
F	EDDIE	Yeah.
F	MELISSA	Are you getting a headache?
F	EDDIE	Finish your story.
F	MELISSA	Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here.
M	MELISSA (CONT'D)	That was two years ago, and I haven't been the same since. I can't read any more -- I mean, the fucking New York Post?
M	MELISSA (CONT'D)	After this, I'm going to have a migraine for three days. And I've got to pee. Which is another thing.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	How many times had I thought of her, my first real love...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	But that Melissa had unraveled in time and space -- she was a ghost now. I was never going to see her again, never bump into her in the street...
F	MELISSA	You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go--
F	EDDIE	But when I run out--
F	MELISSA	I don't know. I have to go--
F	EDDIE	Who invented MDT?
F	MELISSA	I don't know-- Goodbye, Eddie.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	No one seemed to be watching my apartment, maybe I could chance it.
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I was getting sicker by the moment. Luckily I had one pill on me... CONTINUED:
M	GENNADY	You fucking forget about me? Huh?
F	EDDIE	I... I... ahh...
M	GENNADY	One o'clock? And you not here?! Eddie tries to catch his breath.
F	EDDIE	I'm here now!
F	EDDIE	I'll get you a check.
M	GENNADY	A check? A check?! You out of your fucking mind?! What you think we are, some financial institution?
F	EDDIE	Gennady, look-
M	GENNADY	I cut your balls off!
F	EDDIE	I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF! CONTINUED:
M	GENNADY	What you got there?
F	EDDIE	NOTHING--
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	It's aspirin.
M	GENNADY	Don't look like no aspirin I ever see!
M	GENNADY (CONT'D)	What is it? Something good, eh?
F	EDDIE	That's the whole thing, plus twenty.
M	GENNADY	I feel good. What in that shit?
F	EDDIE	Aspirin and vitamins.
M	GENNADY	You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I know you lie about the movie script too. THE MONITOR -
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	I had to get my stash.
M	FEMALE ASSISTANT	Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him...
F	LINDY	It's all right, Lisa.
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	Eddie-- What is it--?
F	EDDIE	I'm sorry -- I'm sick. I wasn't going to make it home-
F	LINDY	Okay. Okay, I'll get you to a DOCTOR-- IT WON'T HELP--! I need to get-- it's very simple: I need my pills.
F	LINDY	What kind of pills? CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	They're... for my headaches...
F	LINDY	What headaches? What are you--? Are you on some drug?
F	EDDIE	It's... complicated.
F	LINDY	Oh. Oh. So all this energy of yours, all this focus... has been some drug, Eddie?
F	EDDIE	Not... the way you...
F	LINDY	You need a doctor.
F	EDDIE	No. That won't--
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Hello?
F	VALERIE	What the hell are you doing up there?
F	EDDIE	W-what?
F	VALERIE	Are you tearing up your floor or something?!
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I knew what was going on.
F	LINDY	...a smart drug...?
F	EDDIE	It was supposed to be legal.
F	LINDY	Oh, Eddie... you jerk.
F	EDDIE	I have a supply... stashed...
F	LINDY	No.
F	EDDIE	I just need... to get it...
F	LINDY	And I'm supposed to just GO?! In the middle of my work day?! To your APARTMENT to get you more DRUGS?
F	EDDIE	Not to my apartment. I moved it.
F	LINDY	You did--? Why?!
F	EDDIE	I was smart. I was on MDT.
F	LINDY	Then where did you keep it--? CONTINUED:
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	Oh, you prick.
F	LINDY	You asshole... in my fucking HOUSE?!
F	EDDIE	Hi -- Have you got it?
F	LINDY	Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me.
F	EDDIE	Are you sure?
F	LINDY	He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making! CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Don't get out.
F	LINDY	What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?!
F	EDDIE	Call the cops.
F	LINDY	There's traffic. We're slowing down... Go around him! Go around! Shit! We're stopped dead. He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here-
F	EDDIE	LINDY--!!!
F	LINDY	Help! Help!! CONTINUED:
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	There's... a... man... chasing me. He has a long, tan --
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	Are you still there?
F	EDDIE	Yes. What's happening?
F	LINDY	I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me!
F	EDDIE	Just be still, stop talking.
F	LINDY	He killed a cop--
F	EDDIE	What?
F	LINDY	He's going to kill me, Eddie!
F	EDDIE	Listen to me. Can he see you?
F	LINDY	You fucking asshole-- CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Can he see you?!
F	LINDY	Not yet. --I don't know what to do! What do I do--!
F	EDDIE	There is something.
F	LINDY	What?!
F	EDDIE	Listen to me. Reach into the bag and take one of the pills.
F	LINDY	S-swallow one of those things?!
F	EDDIE	Yes. You will know what do to, Lindy. Take one, and you'll know.
F	LINDY	He's got a knife -- I can't think my way out of a knife--!
F	EDDIE	You'll come on in thirty seconds. And yes, you will think your way out, that's what it does. Are you taking it--?
F	LINDY	Yes. He's getting closer.
F	EDDIE	Lindy. I love you. --Lindy? Are you there?
F	LINDY	Eddie...? I feel it.
F	EDDIE	We'll stay here for a couple of days. We'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this...
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I'm back. All right?
F	LINDY	Who's back, Eddie?
F	EDDIE	I can take care of you now.
F	LINDY	That was never what I wanted.
F	EDDIE	A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you.
F	LINDY	You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty.
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	I understand that stuff now, Eddie. And I don't blame you for taking it. No one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. Invincibility in a bottle. And I know I'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life.
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	But once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want to fuck up? Who'd want to be human?
M	LINDY (CONT'D)	I just came up to say goodbye. I don't ever want to see you again. I'm not even going to stay in New York. Don't try to find me, and don't try to help me.
F	EDDIE	Looking for me? CONTINUED:
M	GENNADY	You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are?
F	EDDIE	I was under the impression that our business was settled.
M	GENNADY	Walk.
F	EDDIE	So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman.
M	GENNADY	I want some more of that shit.
F	EDDIE	What shit.
M	GENNADY	The pills.
F	EDDIE	Well, so do I. You took the last one.
M	GENNADY	So you get me more.
F	EDDIE	I can't get more -- the dealer's dead.
M	GENNADY	Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog?
F	EDDIE	Nothing. I. Can. Do.
M	GENNADY	Make some calls. One hundred pills.
F	EDDIE	A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on--
M	GENNADY	You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages.
F	EDDIE	I might... be able to get ten.
M	GENNADY	Ten. Fuck your ten.
F	EDDIE	Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
M	GENNADY	Oh, I think guarantee.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Self-pity and MDT were not compatible. One has to go on...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	...Patch up what's left...
M	VAN LOON	I won't deny you pissed me off, Eddie.
F	EDDIE	I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me--
M	VAN LOON	I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
F	EDDIE	A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.
M	VAN LOON	Look, there can't be any instability. Not when you're playing at this level.
F	EDDIE	I sent over my revised projections--
M	VAN LOON	I didn't ask for your projections.
F	EDDIE	I know, but I think if you look at THEM-
M	VAN LOON	I already have.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	As a matter of fact, there were firings over your projections.
F	EDDIE	I'm sorry.
M	VAN LOON	...some things my team missed. So, oddly enough, I find myself... needing to fill a position. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Two months after I started MDT, I was helping broker the most important merger in corporate history.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	I found that if I maintained an even dose... remembered to eat... drank no alcohol... the blackouts didn't recur.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	I was quickly back up to speed...
F	EDDIE	Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment?
M	TAILOR	Certainly, sir. How large?
F	EDDIE	Quite large. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I would never again stash my MDT, not in an apartment, not in Fort Knox.
F	EDDIE	I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out.
M	TECHNICIAN	Well, it's nothing you can cook up on a stove top. Whoever made it, it's a real pro act.
F	EDDIE	Can you make more?
M	TECHNICIAN	Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities? Yes. CONTINUED: But the exact method of delivery to the brain...? Darts at a dartboard.
F	EDDIE	Meaning...?
M	TECHNICIAN	Clinical trials. Guinea pig people.
F	EDDIE	That's too long.
M	TECHNICIAN	It's what it is. Or you'll kill people. You need twelve, eighteen MONTHS--
F	EDDIE	Two million dollars if you do it in six. It was all going to work out...
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	I thought we straightened this out, Detective.
M	DETECTIVE	This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morgan. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	What is it about?
M	DETECTIVE	A witness identified the Donatella Alvarez suspect as this person. You want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Luckily, I could now afford Morris Brandt, the best lawyer in New York.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Time was bought, and I was released -- for now.
M	MORRIS BRANDT	You're lucky somebody wiped the room. Weak circumstantial at best. Just between us -- were you there?
F	EDDIE	I don't remember.
M	MORRIS BRANDT	Busy life. CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood remained unaware that soon, I would be in a witness lineup as a possible murderer.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out...
M	HANK ATWOOD	How do you know this?
F	EDDIE	Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat...
M	ATWOOD	Go on.
M	VAN LOON	Eddie...? What's your read.
F	EDDIE	It flew. Of course, he's not going to tell you right now... CONTINUED:
M	VAN LOON	Jesus. He seems frail.
F	EDDIE	Might be an act.
M	VAN LOON	Yeah, doesn't track. He's not even
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	So, Eddie. What are you going to do?
F	EDDIE	When this is over? I don't know. You haven't given me the answer.
M	VAN LOON	You haven't asked the question.
F	EDDIE	All right. If all this comes off... what's my take?
M	VAN LOON	You should have pre-negotiated.
F	EDDIE	I trust you.
M	VAN LOON	You shouldn't.
F	EDDIE	Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five.
M	VAN LOOK	Done. Forty five thousand dollars.
M	VAN LOON	Forty million's plenty, Eddie. There's plenty more where this came from.
M	VAN LOOK	...But you're not going to continue working for me, are you?
M	VAN LOON	Don't lie. You're already bored. Onto the next...?
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	I would really love to know what, after a forty million dollar payout, is "next" to you. But you're not going to tell me that, either. And I'm not sure I want to know. Might singe my ego.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	I'll open a line of credit for you. Even a tough nut like you's going to want a few toys.
M	REALTOR	... three restaurants, health club, of course, a private screening room, wine cellar, walk-in humidor... unparalleled, three-tier security system... CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	What is the asking price?
M	REALTOR	Twelve point five.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	It was, as it turned out, a good moment to move.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	No one knew, or would ever know, that I now carried the pills with me at all times.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Right away, it was obvious he was on MDT.
M	GENNADY	Next week...? I require twenty pills.
F	EDDIE	Next week? You can fuck yourself. Not that you'll feel anything. CONTINUED:
M	GENNADY	I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police?
M	GENNADY (CONT'D)	Thursday. You have them here.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Obviously, this could not go on. But there is very little on this earth that 45 million dollars can't solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers.
M	PIERCE	Well, you want to call it?
M	ASSOCIATE #1	Cold feet.
M	VAN LOON	There was all last night to tell us that.
M	VAN LOON (CONT'D)	No call?
M	SECRETARY'S VOICE	Not yet. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't. It's still on.
M	PIERCE	Oh, based on your graphs and projections?
F	EDDIE	I saw his eyes: it's on.
M	PIERCE	You know, remind me: who the fuck, exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry, Carl, I'm about at the end with this unqualified, posturing little-
M	VAN LOON	Pull it back, Pierce.
M	PIERCE	Since when is this little pisher the fucking Delphi Oracle?! PIERCE-
M	SECRETARY'S VOICE	Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here.
M	VAN LOON	Pierce, you can stay.
M	MRS. ATWOOD	I wanted this to be as confidential as possible. CONTINUED:
M	MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D)	My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning. He's at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests.
M	MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D)	Obviously, it wouldn't be in our best interests for this to be reported by the press, as it might put some of his interests at risk. I just want you to know that we have every intention of signing the contract, and, as soon as he is able, we will proceed.
F	EDDIE	I realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do...
M	VAN LOON	Obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible.
M	MRS. ATWOOD	Thank you so much. I rely on your discretion.
M	VAN LOON	You think there's a proxy?
F	EDDIE	Cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney? CONTINUED:
M	VAN LOON	Well. He'd better get better.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	But Atwood wouldn't get better. Because Atwood was out of MDT.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Well. Why be surprised? How many other meteoric rises might be explained by MDT? At least I had some; my life wasn't in jeopardy. Only my money...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	...and my liberty.
M	MORRIS BRANDT	I've been all over them... we can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the lineup -- they're as close to your clones as I could possibly get away with -- it's going to be one big handsome blur to this guy-
M	FEMALE COP	Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change your jacket. CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Why?
M	MORRIS BRANDT	Oh, that's me... I want everyone in the same shirt, better for the blur factor...
F	EDDIE	Of course.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Who was out there? The woman's husband? Was some bellboy I undertipped about to end my life?
M	MORRIS BRANDT	Not the dimmest clue. He was dithering.
M	MORRIS BRANDT (CONT'D)	"Maybe the third from the right... No not him..." --Oh. Here you go.
M	MORRIS BRANDT (CONT'D)	Thing of beauty. You had it made?
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	They'd kept me all day.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I'd missed my meeting with Gennady.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	But I had more important business...
M	FEMALE NEWSCASTER	...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
M	VAN LOON	Have you been talking to anyone?
F	EDDIE	Not a word, Carl.
M	VAN LOON	Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to VAPOR-- CONTINUED:
F	EDDIE	Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement.
M	VAN LOON	No. Atwood's in a coma.
F	EDDIE	A coma?
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	It had gotten out, somehow. But I felt thick, stupid, tired. A small pain was starting behind my eyes. I'd been unable to take my MDT, and I was overdue.
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The police station? A coat room? How? How?
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	In an hour I'd be useless. In two I'd be sick. In 24, dead.
M	VAN LOON	Eddie--? This came for you.
M	VAN LOON	What are you doing, Eddie--? EDDIE--!!! I couldn't think.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Only MDT could help me. I had no MDT. And then... CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	One thought. Was there anywhere...
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	... anywhere at all...I could have left one pill...?
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I had to keep thinking. Somewhere safe...
M	MRS. HANK ATWOOD	There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger. None whatsoever. My husband is having some tests, this is a difficult time, and I would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney...
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	It wasn't downstairs security, alerting me to a visitor. CONTINUED: It was my inner door. Someone was in the building, ten feet away, right now. And so... here I am.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I knew they would kill me, slowly and horribly. But this choice would at least be mine.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live. CONTINUED: So, my foggy brain tried to remember... where one tablet of MDT... might be.
M	EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It was possible. And possible was enough. CONTINUED:
M	GENNADY	I told you I want more. You don't listen. Maybe you think I'm joking...
M	GENNADY (CONT'D)	But I'm down to this last one.
M	GENNADY (CONT'D)	See, I dissolve pill in solution. You shoot it - goes straight into blood and to brain. Works much better. Now. Where do you keep yours?
F	EDDIE	I'm plum out.
M	GENNADY	They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh?
M	GENNADY	This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate...
M	GENNADY (CONT'D)	First, I will cut skin from you, flay you... you stay alive nice long time... then maybe we cut meat from you, steaks... or maybe softer parts... I get inspiration... WHAT-- CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Not much of a triumph, was it? Because I would die here, too.
M	EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Only MDT could help me, and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream... CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
M	EDDIE (V.0.)	Later, it would be noted that my neighbor was in the music business. One of his drug deals had obviously gone bad... And the night was still young.
F	EDDIE	I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication? Or, did the Pony decide that he should be running his own Pony show? Minus the dog.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	I would not go back. I would not be stopped.
M	REUBEN	...actually, no, there's no more tickets. --Yeah, I know, an overbooked fundraiser -- there's a first -- well, here he comes, I'll ask him -- Edward!!
M	REUBEN (CONT'D)	I think we're looking at a second, overflow event-- there's a wave of donations coming in -- and I don't think they're even going to try a second debate -- don't go yet --
F	EDDIE	I have a lunch.
M	REUBEN	John Steadman's in there.
F	EDDIE	Who's that?
M	REUBEN	--Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're your biggest contributor, give him his two shitty little minutes.
F	EDDIE	Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research?
M	REUBEN	Pharmaceuticals.
M	STEADMAN	Mr. Morgan.
F	EDDIE	Nice to see you. We appreciate everything you've done for us--
M	STEADMAN	Well, you've done most of it for yourself. Senator Morgan.
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	I mean, everything from here's a technicality, isn't it, Eddie?
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	I think we both know where it's heading... If... you can maintain.
F	EDDIE	Maintain?
M	STEADMAN	Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you.
F	EDDIE	What are you saying? CONTINUED:
M	STEADMAN	We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week.
F	EDDIE	Have you been watching me from the beginning?
M	STEADMAN	No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us.
F	EDDIE	Who's "us?"
M	STEADMAN	You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting.
F	EDDIE	How did it get on the street?
M	STEADMAN	Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it.
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	It will never again be on the street. It will never publicly exist. Obviously I don't need to detail the advantages for you.
F	EDDIE	And what about for you? Why don't you take it?
M	STEADMAN	We don't have to. You'll take it for us.
F	EDDIE	And in return...? I do what.
M	STEADMAN	Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first.
F	EDDIE	And later...? What will you be "bothering" me with?
M	STEADMAN	Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable.
F	EDDIE	And if I don't like your ideas?
M	STEADMAN	Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light.
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	But let's not even go there. Right now you should feel relieved, your problems are over. We just want to keep you healthy... and brilliant.
F	EDDIE	Luckily I can do that myself.
M	STEADMAN	Well, no, ah, that won't be the case. We shut your lab down this morning.
F	EDDIE	My lab?
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Which one?
M	STEADMAN	All of them.
F	EDDIE	You sure?
M	STEADMAN	We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement. Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving...
F	EDDIE	Tell me something.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	Did I kill that woman?
M	STEADMAN	Do you really want to know?
M	STEADMAN	It's not so bad, is it?
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	Doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind- drag of compromise?
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	Overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the Constitution could stand a little tweaking...
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	Eddie?
F	EDDIE	After you.
M	STEADMAN	No, "Senator". You first.
F	EDDIE	Please.
M	STEADMAN	All right then...
M	STEADMAN (CONT'D)	Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.
F	EDDIE	Don't underestimate your own creation. I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks. You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private?
M	STEADMAN	You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.
F	EDDIE	You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.
M	STEADMAN	You'll run out. You'll die.
F	EDDIE	Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it.
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	What if I just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? I mean, isn't it like the 8-ball?
M	EDDIE (CONT'D)	It always answers.
M	THE END
