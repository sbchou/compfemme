M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	COMMODUS	Do you think he's really dying?
F	LUCILLA	He's been dying for ten years.
M	COMMODUS	I think he's really dying this time.
M	COMMODUS	He has to be bled every night now.
F	LUCILLA	How do you know that?
M	COMMODUS	I've been so informed.
M	COMMODUS	If he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us.
F	LUCILLA	Maybe he just misses us.
M	COMMODUS	And the Senators. He wouldn't have summoned them if --
F	LUCILLA	Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
M	COMMODUS	The first thing I shall do is honor him with games worthy of his majesty.
F	LUCILLA	The first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.
M	COMMODUS	Why have we stopped?
M	PRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER	We're here, sir.
M	COMMODUS	Where is my father?
M	SOLDIER #1	He's at the front, sir.
M	COMMODUS	Is the battle won?
M	SOLDIER #1	Don't know, sir. They've been gone for eight days.
M	COMMODUS	My sister wants a bath, take her to the camp. Take me to my father.
F	LUCILLA	Civilization at last. Gods preserve us.
M	TITUS	You would do as well to read the mind of a rhinoceros.
M	QUINTUS	These barbarians would rather drown in blood than yield an inch. If I didn't hate them so much I would admire them.
M	TITUS	They simply will not surrender.
F	MAXIMUS	A people should know when they are conquered.
F	MAXIMUS	At the first signal release the catapults. We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat.
M	QUINTUS	General, I don't recommend that. Our cavalry might be caught in the flames.
F	MAXIMUS	I hope not, because I'm going to be leading them.
F	MAXIMUS	Why don't they know they're already dead?
M	QUINTUS	Now!
F	MAXIMUS	Hold steady... steady...
F	MAXIMUS	Steady...
F	MAXIMUS	Brothers -- I salute you! For Rome!
F	MAXIMUS	Caesar.
M	MARCUS	Maximus, you prove your valor again. Let us hope for the final time here.
F	MAXIMUS	I don't think there's anyone left to fight.
M	MARCUS	There are always people left to fight...
M	MARCUS	But this night, at least, Germania is at last defeated... What will you do now, my friend?
F	MAXIMUS	Should Caesar permit, I'll go home. I've been away too long. I've forgotten my wife's face and I barely know my son.
M	GERMAN PRISONER	THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!
M	MARCUS	Stop... ... You speak our language?
M	GERMAN PRISONER	You have been in my homeland for twelve years. Of course I speak your language. So did my son, who you murdered. So did my daughter, who you raped.
F	MAXIMUS	Come, Caesar...
M	MARCUS	No. Let him speak... ... I am Rome, what would you say to me?
M	GERMAN PRISONER	You are that sun, Rome, and your time is over... You can slit a thousand throats here, and you can put a thousand babies to the sword, but it will always be our home. Now it is Rome.
M	GERMAN PRISONER	It will never be Rome. Not as long as one German breathes.
M	MARCUS	No... Release him. Give him safe passage. Let him go to his family.
M	MARCUS	Tell me again, Maximus, why are we here?
F	MAXIMUS	For the glory of the empire, sire.
M	MARCUS	Yes. I remember.
F	MAXIMUS	They honor you, Caesar.
M	MARCUS	I don't think they're standing for me, Maximus. They honor you.
M	COMMODUS	Have I missed it?
M	COMMODUS	Have I missed the battle?
M	MARCUS	You've missed the war. We're done here.
M	COMMODUS	Father. Congratulations. I shall sacrifice a thousand doves to honor your triumph.
M	MARCUS	Spare the doves and honor Maximus, he won the battle.
M	COMMODUS	General, Rome salutes you and I embrace you as a brother.
F	MAXIMUS	Highness.
M	COMMODUS	Your Spaniards seem invincible. May the Gods favor the Felix Regiment now and always... Here, Father, take my arm.
M	MARCUS	Where's your sister?
M	COMMODUS	She's at the camp. She had no desire to see the gore of the battlefield.
M	MARCUS	Lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne.
F	MAXIMUS	Caesar, you do the lady injustice.
M	MARCUS	It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't recognize his own off-spring... I think... I should ride now.
M	MARCUS	So much for the glory of Rome.
M	COMMODUS	He's dying.
M	COMMODUS	Poor old man.
F	MAXIMUS	If you'll excuse me, Highness.
F	MAXIMUS	What, Gallus, losing your other hand?
M	GALLUS	Aye, General, they're going to make a bronze one for it. Long fingers this time.
F	MAXIMUS	And the women of your village will crave your touch even more.
M	GALLUS	Ah, then you know the women of my village.
F	MAXIMUS	What's your name, son?
M	VALERIUS	Valerius, General.
F	MAXIMUS	The name suits you.
M	VALERIUS	Why am I dying?
F	MAXIMUS	You're dying because you love Rome, as I do.
M	VALERIUS	I've never been to Rome.
F	MAXIMUS	Neither have I. Rome for us lives here... ... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children.
M	VALERIUS	It must be glorious, Rome. I've only seen pictures. Is it a glorious place?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes, it's a glorious place.
M	VALERIUS	It must be.
M	FALCO	Hail, Marcus Aurelius.
M	MARCUS	Stand up, Senators. That unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you.
M	GAIUS	We live in supplication to your glory.
M	MARCUS	All the while conspiring with that fat man in Rome. How is the old monster?
M	GAIUS	Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.
M	MARCUS	Still damning me to the four winds?
M	GAIUS	Still eager for your triumphant return to Rome, Caesar.
M	MARCUS	I would have silenced him decades ago -- but I just like him too much.
F	MAXIMUS	If you want to stay on, I support you. So do the men. I'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place.
M	TITUS	It won't be the Felix Regiment without you.
F	MAXIMUS	I'll return after a season at home. Maybe two.
M	QUINTUS	That means after three or four more babies.
M	TITUS	And you'll be too fat from Vibia's cooking to get on your horse by then.
F	MAXIMUS	Should the Gods so bless me. I would be thankful.
M	COMMODUS	Hail, warriors. My congratulations.
M	TITUS AND QUINTUS	Highness.
M	COMMODUS	My old friend, my father tells me you're returning to Spain?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
M	COMMODUS	A pity. I'll need men like you in my army...
M	COMMODUS	There are larger division that might appeal to you. Even the Praetorian Guard. You've never been to Rome. Imagine arriving as head of the Praetorians! They have really splendid uniforms.
F	MAXIMUS	I'm going home.
M	GAIUS	... And why not apply for entry to the Senate?
M	FALCO	A war hero with a handsome face and a strong heart could go far.
M	COMMODUS	General Maximus, may I present Senators Gaius and Falco. Beware of this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is "Republic, Republic, Republic..."
M	FALCO	Have you never considered Rome?
F	MAXIMUS	No.
M	COMMODUS	You've had my ear since we were children. You could be a valuable ally in the Senate.
M	GAIUS	Are you a believer in Republicanism?
M	COMMODUS	There -- I warned you.
F	MAXIMUS	I'm a soldier, not a politician.
M	GAIUS	If your heart lies with the people, I would back you for the Senate. I'm sure Gracchus would as well.
M	COMMODUS	Not a word about that sodomite bastard.
M	GAIUS	The august Senator Gracchus has been rather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family.
M	FALCO	He's a damned provocateur.
M	GAIUS	He lives under the antiquated assumption that the Senate should represent the people with vigor.
M	COMMODUS	I won't tolerate it. His incessant criticism exhausts me. The man can speak for five hours without taking a breath.
M	GAIUS	He serves Rome best when he serves it with honesty.
M	COMMODUS	Enough... Maximus, I would like to inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn. Please arrange it.
F	MAXIMUS	I can't do that.
M	COMMODUS	Excuse me?
F	MAXIMUS	My men have been fighting for five solid days. They're too busy dying to go on dress parade.
M	COMMODUS	Of course, how foolish of me. Some other time...
M	COMMODUS	Caesar retires early tonight.
M	MARCUS	If only you had been born a man...
F	LUCILLA	Father.
M	MARCUS	What a Caesar you would have made.
F	LUCILLA	You're right.
M	MARCUS	I think you would have been strong. I wonder if you would have been just?
F	LUCILLA	I would have been what you taught me to be.
M	MARCUS	Well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber.
M	MARCUS	This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?
F	MAXIMUS	Caesar.
M	MARCUS	Read this.
F	MAXIMUS	I never acquired the art, sir.
M	MARCUS	Of course. No matter. In this letter I denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after my death.
M	MARCUS	My son is not a moral man. You have known this since you were young. He cannot rule.
F	MAXIMUS	Caesar, I am honored but --
M	MARCUS	For twenty years I have been spilling blood. For twenty years I have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered. Since I became Caesar I have only had four years without war. Four years of peace in twenty. So perhaps I can be... forgiven.
M	MARCUS	While I have been fighting, Rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased. I did this. And now I shall make it right.
F	MAXIMUS	Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness. You brought civilization and justice to the farthest --
M	MARCUS	I have brought the sword -- nothing more! Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here. What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls? What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?
M	MARCUS	Winter, Maximus. It's winter now...
M	MARCUS	There was a dream that was Rome. I can only whisper of it now. Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes. It's so... fragile. The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea. Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen. Where every free man has a voice. That was the dream... And I fear it will not survive the winter.
M	MARCUS	Let's just whisper here, you and I.
F	MAXIMUS	Yes, Caesar.
M	MARCUS	If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice. The voice I took from them. That all the Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest. And now that I am dying I am going to give them that voice again.
F	MAXIMUS	You're not dying.
M	MARCUS	I am, Maximus. It's strange... I find as I near the end I think little of the waning moments around me... instead I think much of the past... and of the future. How will the world speak my name in years to come? Will I be known as the philosopher? The warrior? The tyrant? Or will there be a more golden sounding to my name? Will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her freedom?
M	MARCUS	Before I die I will give the people this final gift. I will give them the Senate reborn. The voice of the people empowered again, as it was always meant to be. It is my design that they will elect the next Emperor. And I would put forward your name with my backing.
F	MAXIMUS	Caesar, you do me honor -- but your son has pride of place for succession.
M	MARCUS	You are the son I should have had... Although I fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood would have polluted you as it did Commodus. We're a cursed bloodline. We have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a life without it. We can no longer even imagine a life without it.
M	MARCUS	Look at me, son.
M	MARCUS	Son... I know that one grove of your vineyard is worth more to you than all the treasures of Rome. I know one loving word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an Empire. But... a fond old man, who loves you more than he can say, begs you to at least think about what he has said tonight.
F	MAXIMUS	I shall, Caesar.
M	MARCUS	I'll keep this letter to myself. I hope that with the sunrise you will agree. And embrace me as a father.
F	MAXIMUS	You have always been my father.
M	LUCILLA'S VOICE	He always favored you...
F	LUCILLA	Even over his son.
F	MAXIMUS	That's not true.
F	LUCILLA	Maximus, stop... Let me see your face.
F	LUCILLA	You've been crying.
F	MAXIMUS	I lost too many men.
F	LUCILLA	What does my father intend?
F	MAXIMUS	I don't know.
F	LUCILLA	You're lying. I could tell when you were lying even when we were children. You hate it.
F	MAXIMUS	I never acquired your comfort with it.
F	LUCILLA	True. But then you never had to. Maximus, stop... ... Is it really so terrible seeing me again?
F	MAXIMUS	No. I'm sorry. I'm tired from the battle.
F	LUCILLA	And you are hurt to see my father dying.
F	LUCILLA	He will announce Commodus' succession. That's why he summoned us. Will you serve my brother as you served his father?
F	MAXIMUS	I will always serve the ideals of Rome.
F	LUCILLA	Do you know I still remember you in my prayers...? Oh yes, I pray... Ever since that day you saved me from drowning off Capri. Do you remember?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
F	LUCILLA	Commodus was so angry that a mere peasant -- a Spaniard no less -- touched the royal person, do you remember his anger?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
F	LUCILLA	Mark this, Maximus: that is the man who will be Emperor.
F	MAXIMUS	May I be permitted to go, Highness?
F	LUCILLA	There was a time when you didn't call me "Highness."
F	MAXIMUS	And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea. All that was a different life.
F	LUCILLA	Very different... I wonder if it was better?
F	MAXIMUS	It was more honest.
F	MAXIMUS	I thank you for your prayers.
F	MAXIMUS	Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance. Bring me your solace and your wisdom. Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword. Keep them safe until my return. Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air. Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.
M	COMMODUS	I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you... to make you proud... and I can never do it. One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years... What is it in me you hate so much? My eyes are your eyes. My hands are your hands. All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar. Father.
M	COMMODUS	Why does Maximus deserve what I could never have? -- Why do you love his eyes over mine? -- I would butcher the whole world -- if you would only love me...
M	QUINTUS	General -- Maximus --
F	MAXIMUS	Quintus -- ?
M	QUINTUS	The Emperor needs you. It's urgent.
F	MAXIMUS	What is it? Is he ill?
M	QUINTUS	I don't know...
M	COMMODUS	Lament with me, brother, our great father is dead. I want --
M	COMMODUS	General, the Gods' have taken the great man and left me alone. My first desire as Emperor is that you take my hand in friendship. I need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above all others. Stand with me.
F	MAXIMUS	How did he die?
F	MAXIMUS	How did he die?
M	COMMODUS	The surgeons say it was his breath that gave out.
M	COMMODUS	Take my hand, Maximus. I only offer it once.
F	MAXIMUS	How will the world speak your name now, old man?
F	LUCILLA	Hail, Caesar.
F	MAXIMUS	What -- ?!
M	QUINTUS	Please don't fight, Maximus --
F	MAXIMUS	Quintus --
M	QUINTUS	I'm sorry, General, Caesar has spoken.
F	MAXIMUS	Quintus, what -- ?
M	QUINTUS	I have no choice --
F	MAXIMUS	My family?!
F	MAXIMUS	What about my family, Quintus?
M	QUINTUS	They will greet you in the afterlife.
M	QUINTUS	Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him.
M	ASSASSIN #1	All right, this is far enough. You two take him down there where no one will find him.
M	ASSASSIN #3	Come on, General...
F	MAXIMUS	Have you ever done this before?
M	ASSASSIN #3	What?
F	MAXIMUS	Killed a man with a sword?
M	ASSASSIN #3	Not like this, exactly... this is good, you can stop.
F	MAXIMUS	It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor. You don't want to hack me up now. You want one clean stroke.
M	ASSASSIN #3	Would you kneel, General?
F	MAXIMUS	One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you?
M	ASSASSIN #4	Be quiet.
F	MAXIMUS	If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere. Quite a spray.
M	ASSASSINS #3	All right, where?
F	MAXIMUS	Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck --
F	MAXIMUS	Put the point of your sword here... you want one, good blow right at this spot --
M	COMMODUS	Even as the Gods curse this dark day with clouds, so too does the sun begin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow. Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright, new age for Rome. At my side, brothers, you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens. At my side, brothers, you shall know the adoration of the Gods. Doubly-dark is this day because my friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state...
M	COMMODUS	Until his promised return I appointed Quintus Domitian to serve in his stead. I salute you, Legionnaires!
M	QUINTUS	Hail, Caesar!
M	FELIX REGIMENT	Hail, Caesar!
M	TITUS	Quintus, what is -- ?
M	QUINTUS	Don't speak of it. Never speak of it. MOTHER! MOTHER! FATHER'S HOME!
F	MAXIMUS	Am I in Hades?
M	JUBA	Yes.
M	JUBA	For your wound...
M	JUBA	For your wound.
M	JUBA	If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions... The lions are worth more than we are. I think we are worth more than the zebras though. So they don't feed us to them.
M	JUBA	I'm not sure about the giraffe.
M	SLAVE TRADER	Proximo, my old friend, see what I have for you today -- !
M	PROXIMO	Those giraffes you sold me won't mate! All they do is run around not mating! YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH GIRAFFES!!
M	SLAVE TRADER	I will make it up to you, Master. It's bargain day for you! Look, look, look -- I have two lions and a panther -- hear how they roar for you! "Bring me home, Proximo!"
M	PROXIMO	How much for the lot?
M	SLAVE TRADER	For you -- 8,000 sesterces.
M	PROXIMO	For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want to see their balls first. And you throw in those two slaves.
M	SLAVE TRADER	What about this one? Look at the arms!
M	PROXIMO	Good teeth --
M	PROXIMO	Where did you get those scars?
M	PROXIMO	Are you a soldier?
M	PROXIMO	Do you speak? -- KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME! He's dying.
M	SLAVE TRADER	1,000 sesterces.
M	PROXIMO	My ass... You throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot.
M	SLAVE TRADER	I have to eat, Master! He's my finest, I couldn't let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total... I tell you this one is prime. He's a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my men before he could be subdued!
M	PROXIMO	All right, let's see.
M	PROXIMO	That's enough.
M	SLAVE TRADER	STOP! STOP!
M	PROXIMO	I'll give you 500 sesterces.
M	SLAVE TRADER	No -- no -- 1,000!
M	PROXIMO	Come, don't quibble with your old friend. I'll take the lions, the panther, the Numidian and this one for 7,000. And I'll buy you the best whore in the town for two nights. She's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand.
M	SLAVE TRADER	How could I say no to my old friend Proximo?
M	PROXIMO	COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!
M	PROXIMO	Slaves. I am Proximo, trainer of gladiators. You live and die at my pleasure. Fight well and you will live. Fight poorly and you will die. It is better to live.
M	PROXIMO	Here you will be trained in the art of combat. Here you will be given the tools to survive. Please my patrons in the arena and all the gifts of the world will be showered upon you. Imagine riches beyond your paltry dreams of riches! Imagine fame beyond your rude understanding of the word! All this can belong to the select few who prove their worth in the arena.
M	PROXIMO	If... on the other hand... you disappoint me... you will be dismembered and fed to my jackals limb by limb.
M	PROXIMO	And my jackals are always hungry.
M	JUBA	Have you killed a man before?
M	JUBA	You should eat. You'll need your strength tomorrow.
M	JUBA	I've never killed a man. But I think you have.
M	JUBA	I almost killed once. The Romans destroyed my village. I was with a hunting party and when we returned... I would have killed every Roman in the world.
M	JUBA	If you don't eat you will die.
M	JUBA	In the village I come from there was a man once. He went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles. One of them ate his leg. He pulled himself to the shore and a lion attacked him. It ate one of his arms. He dragged himself through the desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye. So he only had one eye. When he reached the village I sat with him. I said, "You have lost a leg, an arm and one eye. You must have a mighty will to live." He said, "No, Lord, it's just better than the alternative."
M	JUBA	us. Who are you to give it up for lack of lifting a spoon?
M	SCRIBE	I know nothing of armaments and warfare! I'm a scribe -- I write down words! I can write down seven languages --
M	VIBIUS	Be still.
M	SCRIBE	I don't -- how do you hold the sword?! I've never held a sword!
M	VIBIUS	You point the sharp end at your opponent and you shove it in his guts.
M	SCRIBE	I can't -- I --
M	VIBIUS	Proximo! You insult me with this carrion! Chain him to someone else!
M	PROXIMO	Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't be bothering you for long.
M	CHILDREN	Dead guts! Dead guts! Dead guts!
M	PROXIMO	Some of you say you can't fight, you won't fight... They all say that... But one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man. And the crowd will cheer you and love you. And you will love them for it. On that day... you will be a gladiator.
M	PROXIMO	In this life, we all die. All we can choose is how we die. And how we are remembered. Be remembered proudly.
M	PROXIMO	No... ... give the Spaniard to him. Give the Scribe to Vibius.
M	JUBA	Are we going to fight each other?
M	PROXIMO	Make it 600 sesterces for each decapitation.
M	TRAINER #1	How many strokes?
M	PROXIMO	Two.
M	TRAINER #1	For the great Vibius, one stroke.
M	PROXIMO	Done. 400 sesterces for two strokes.
M	TRAINER #1	Who's he with?
M	PROXIMO	A Greek Scribe.
M	TRAINER #1	I'll raise the wager.
M	PROXIMO	Give me odds, friend.
M	GRACCHUS	We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter and it is spreading... we have looting at the granaries... we have so much filth in the Tiber that the water is undrinkable... we have Praetorian Guard units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the exchange --
M	MARCELLUS	My City Guard units have tried to curtail these excesses but no constabulary can police the entire city. And the Praetorians outnumber us two to one.
M	GRACCHUS	Rome dies as the Emperor plays at beneficence. At least Nero gave us music!
M	GAIUS	Do you think he'll listen to us?
M	GRACCHUS	It is his duty to hear the will of the Senate.
M	GRACCHUS	Not to mention the damn traffic!
M	CHILD	We honor Caesar with the laurel to show our love and appreciation for his benevolence.
M	COMMODUS	Caesar is honored to accept your tribute, Citizen Scholar.
M	COMMODUS	It is the most sacred duty of the Emperor to oversee the education of the young. If I could leave no other legacy than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed. Tutors, you hold the future of Rome in your hands. Teach them well so that they will bring honor to the Empire. I salute you.
M	COMMODUS	Look at them, Senators... my truest gift to Rome.
M	GRACCHUS	Darling children, to be sure, now if I may proceed?
M	COMMODUS	Very well...
M	GRACCHUS	Caesar, your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars. We would like to --
M	COMMODUS	Peace, good Gracchus, peace...
M	COMMODUS	My beloved father was a careless shepherd to his flock. I shall be a good father to my children. I shall remain in Rome and show them how they are loved.
M	GRACCHUS	With respect, sire, the people don't need love -- they need law. The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city -- -- starting with basic sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter. If Caesar could study this and --
M	COMMODUS	You see that's the very problem, isn't it, my old, old friend? My father spent all his time at study. At books and learning and philosophy...
M	COMMODUS	He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate. All the while, the people were forgotten.
M	GRACCHUS	The Senate is the people.
M	COMMODUS	I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Senator Gracchus...
M	COMMODUS	I doubt many of the people have such splendid armor, Captain Marcellus. Or such fine mistresses, Senator Gaius. No... only their true father knows what the people need. I shall show them they are loved. I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly --
M	GRACCHUS	Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
M	COMMODUS	No. But if you interrupt me one more time I assure you that you shall. I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past. I will give the people what they truly want. Starting this day I will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum. I will give them bread. And they will want nothing more.
M	GRACCHUS	You want to hold games?
M	COMMODUS	Not just any games, Senator! A series of games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy! I will subsidize the arena from this day forth -- and I will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen! A great spectacle to honor my father! Magnificent, unending weeks of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius!
M	GRACCHUS	If I may, Caesar... how are you going to pay for this?
M	COMMODUS	That is not your concern.
M	GRACCHUS	Respectfully, sire, taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the Senate --
M	COMMODUS	MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL BURN! BURN! BURN! -- I WILL HAVE ORDER!
F	LUCILLA	Gentlemen, in the future do not concern my brother with these matters. Come to me.
M	MARCELLUS	Games? He wants to hold games?
M	GAIUS	It's madness.
M	GRACCHUS	No... it's not...
M	GRACCHUS	He knows who Rome is. Rome is the mob. He will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted. And he will takes their lives. And he will take their freedom. And still they will roar. The beating heart of Rome isn't the marble of the Senate. It's the sand of the Colosseum. He will give them death. And they will love him for it.
M	PROXIMO	I've wagered on you against the Celts -- ignore the others and go for them -- there are two axe-and- net and two long spear. Now the Celts aren't used to the sun so you have the advantage there...
M	PROXIMO	And keep them moving, their lungs aren't strong, ground the spears as soon as you can and then go for the ax-men. If you get all four there's an extra bonus so don't be distracted by the Spartans...
M	VIBIUS	MOVE ASIDE! THIS IS A TABLE FOR MEN!
M	PROXIMO	Butterfly?
M	PROXIMO	Perhaps you'd like a woman?
M	PROXIMO	Boy?
M	PROXIMO	Gold?
M	PROXIMO	Well, I have nothing left to offer you! A man who turns down a butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold confuses me. Personally, I'd grab them all and then grab some more because the Gods are fanciful and take us at their whim. Does the Spaniard have any needs?
M	PROXIMO	You fight like a soldier. You have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns. You eye the world around you like an enemy. What is your name, Roman soldier?
F	MAXIMUS	Gladiator.
M	PROXIMO	And nothing more?
F	MAXIMUS	Nothing more.
M	PROXIMO	In two days we leave for Rome.
M	PROXIMO	Ah... so it's Rome you want. Well you shall have her, Gladiator. The new Emperor has ordered a series of matches to culminate in a grand spectacle. If you do well I shall become very, very rich. If you do well enough I shall set you free. Is it freedom you want?
M	PROXIMO	Not even that.
F	MAXIMUS	The Emperor -- will he be there?
M	PROXIMO	Oh yes. He's apparently quite mad about the games. Spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again. But what is good for you, Gladiator?
F	MAXIMUS	Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor?
M	PROXIMO	As a gladiator?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
M	PROXIMO	One doesn't.
M	PROXIMO	Except... If one has proven oneself in battle. If at the end of the games you are the final man standing -- the Emperor will present you with a small wooden sword. The sword is your freedom.
F	MAXIMUS	He give it personally?
M	PROXIMO	He did to me... Our great father Marcus Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder.
F	MAXIMUS	You knew Marcus?
M	PROXIMO	I didn't know him. He touched me on the shoulder. Just once. But that was enough.
M	PROXIMO	All right, Gladiator. We shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures. The Great Whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can't suck another drop. That is Rome.
M	COMMODUS	All my desires are splitting my head to pieces -- there's so much I want to do -- but all my efforts to show my children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate --
F	LUCILLA	Quiet, brother...
F	LUCILLA	Leave the Senate to me. Don't trouble yourself.
M	COMMODUS	All I want is to be a good father to my people. Why don't they understand that?
F	LUCILLA	Shhh. The tonic will help...
F	LUCILLA	Yes, just drink this down.
M	COMMODUS	I must take a firmer hand with them. They must know their father can be firm. As our father was firm with us.
F	LUCILLA	Our father lost his way. His mistake was believing the old songs of the "Republic." We know better. So let the Senate talk. They have no real power.
M	COMMODUS	Yes... yes... you always know the way. You were always so wise in these matters... You know if I didn't have my duty to Rome I think I should be an artist. I should go away and paint pictures of the sea and leave all the politics to you...
M	COMMODUS	Will you stay with me?
F	LUCILLA	Still afraid of the dark, brother?
M	COMMODUS	Still. Always.
M	COMMODUS	My dreams would terrify the world.
F	LUCILLA	I'll stay with you until you are asleep.
M	COMMODUS	And after... just sit with me. Keep me safe...
F	LUCILLA	He's asleep. Be quick.
M	GRACCHUS	We've taking a sounding, the Senate is with us.
F	LUCILLA	Good.
M	GRACCHUS	But we are only words. We are air. We need steel. Republic. But we don't stand a chance against the Praetorians.
F	LUCILLA	Can they be bought?
M	MARCELLUS	They are zealots -- totally committed to your brother.
M	GRACCHUS	Well, can they at least be rented for a day?
M	MARCELLUS	I doubt it. He pays them exorbitant salaries and lets them loot and extort as they see fit. The city belongs to them.
F	LUCILLA	And they've started arresting scholars now. Anyone who dares speak out -- even satirists and chroniclers.
M	MARCELLUS	And mathematicians and Christians. All to fill the arena.
M	GAIUS	And what pays for it? These games are costing a fortune and yet we have no new taxes.
F	LUCILLA	The future. The future pays for it...
F	LUCILLA	He's started selling the grain reserves.
M	GAIUS	No.
M	MARCELLUS	That can't be true...
F	LUCILLA	He's selling Rome's reserves of grain. The people will be starving in two years. I hope they are enjoying the spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them.
M	MARCELLUS	Rome must know this.
F	LUCILLA	And who will tell them?! You, Marcellus? You, Senator Gaius? Will you make a speech on the Senate floor denouncing my brother? And then see your family in the Colosseum? What town-crier would dare?
F	LUCILLA	He must die.
M	GAIUS	The Praetorians would only seize control themselves.
F	LUCILLA	No -- cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.
M	GRACCHUS	Lucilla, Gaius is right. Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing.
M	MARCELLUS	And I haven't enough men.
F	LUCILLA	What about the army?
M	GAIUS	No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years.
F	LUCILLA	So we do nothing?!
M	LUCIUS' VOICE	Mother...
M	LUCIUS	I heard voices...
F	LUCILLA	It's all right, darling, you --
M	LUCIUS	Senator! What did you bring me?!
M	GRACCHUS	For you prince Lucius... a sea monster!
M	GRACCHUS	Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians they come across... now, where is Achaea?
M	LUCIUS	Below Macedonia!
M	GRACCHUS	Show me on the map.
F	LUCILLA	Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in shortly.
M	LUCIUS	Thank you, Senator Mountain!
M	GRACCHUS	You're welcome, Prince Anthill!
F	LUCILLA	What are you going to do?
M	GRACCHUS	Peace child... One dark night the Gods will light our path. They will give us the voice we need. Have faith in that. Have faith.
M	VIBIUS	Not what you expected?
F	MAXIMUS	No.
M	VIBIUS	Rome is nothing but a slaughter house. And we are the meat.
M	VIBIUS	Tradition. He watches over us.
M	VIBIUS	Oh go on, it won't kill you.
M	PROXIMO	Stop that! You'll get some monstrous disease and then you'll be worth nothing to me!
M	JUBA	Do you think it will be much different? Here in Rome?
F	MAXIMUS	Bigger arena. Same killing.
M	JUBA	Are you scared for tomorrow?
F	MAXIMUS	No.
M	JUBA	Me too.
M	JUBA	I never though it would be so easy to kill.
M	JUBA	So you're finally home.
F	MAXIMUS	This isn't my home.
M	JUBA	For all Romans... this is home.
M	JUBA	Among my people we honor the soil of our home. Our ancestors are in that soil. All their dreams live there. I will never see my home again. The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die.
F	MAXIMUS	Perhaps one day you'll return.
M	JUBA	How can I go back? I am not what I was. When a man kills for no reason, he has lost himself.
M	CASSIUS	... and the Emperor will have no more animal battles today --
M	TRAINER #1	You promised me a bear match, Cassius!
M	TRAINER #2	I have ten damned gorillas! You said gorillas yesterday!
M	CASSIUS	Talk to the man in the imperial box. Who has the next slot...? -- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and Proximo -- -- Nice to have you back, you piratical bastard -- now listen, the Emperor wants the Carthage spectacle.
M	PROXIMO	No -- have pity, Cassius -- !
M	TRAINER #3	My men are too good for -- !
M	CASSIUS	You give us the Carthage match or lose your spot on the rotation -- but don't worry -- gold is flowing from the Emperor's fingers. It'll cost you --
M	PROXIMO	I won't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces -- !
M	TRAINER #4	120,000! All I have is my best Thracians!
M	CASSIUS	And I want to see this famous Spaniard of yours -- his reputation soars from the provinces. The people are eager for him --
M	PROXIMO	I won't throw my Spaniard into a spectacle! Damn you and damn the rotation!
M	CASSIUS	You will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each -- -- which you all know is exorbitant -- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA TOMORROW!
M	TRAINER #4	My Thracians are worth -- !
M	CASSIUS	Give me your best, brothers. They die before Caesar.
M	PROXIMO	I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians.
M	TRAINER #4	30,000?! On a Spaniard?! That provincial sun has curdled your brain!
M	PROXIMO	Then make the wager, you smug bastard!
M	PROXIMO	All right -- there are three other teams, four men each -- You know what a Thracian looks like?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes, but --
M	PROXIMO	Ignore the others -- go for the Thracians. The sun is to the east -- over the gate -- keep your back to the gate and you won't have the sun.
F	MAXIMUS	What -- ?
M	PROXIMO	Hurry -- !
M	PROXIMO	Die well and we'll sing songs about you for a generation.
M	CASSIUS	This day we reach back to hallowed antiquity to bring you... THE FALL OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...! ... On the barren armies of the barbarian Hannibal! Ferocious mercenaries and warriors of all brute nations bent on merciless conquest! Your Emperor is pleased to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!
M	CASSIUS	But on that illustrious day the Gods sent against them Rome's greatest warriors...! The very life-image of nobility and glorious valor... who would on this day, and on these same arid Numidian deserts, decide THE FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor is pleased to give you... THE LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!!
M	COMMODUS	Slave! Who are you?
M	COMMODUS	SLAVE! WHO ARE YOU?
M	COMMODUS	SLAVE! WHO ARE YOU?!
F	MAXIMUS	I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS!
F	MAXIMUS	I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!
M	COMMODUS	Why is he still alive?
F	LUCILLA	I don't know.
M	COMMODUS	He shouldn't be alive. That vexes me. I am terribly vexed...
M	COMMODUS	There, that's better. Do you like the platform here?
F	LUCILLA	Mmm.
M	COMMODUS	I do too. Simple, elegant...
M	COMMODUS	Father would have wanted something more ornate but he's dead now.
M	COMMODUS	Maximus Meridas haunts me. I see Father turning away from me and gazing at him. How many times did I suffer that indignity, I wonder?
F	LUCILLA	What are you going to do?
M	COMMODUS	I'm going to kill him.
F	LUCILLA	Good.
M	COMMODUS	Oh, you're too clever, Sister. Don't tell me part of you won't weep for him.
F	LUCILLA	When he defies my brother the Emperor, he defies me. But you shouldn't send assassins.
M	COMMODUS	No?
F	LUCILLA	The people embraced him today. They will be expecting his next match... ... let him die in the arena like the slave he is. Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar.
M	COMMODUS	He wounded you deeply, didn't he? Long ago.
M	COMMODUS	Nonetheless, your political acumen is, as always, unerring.
M	JUBA	I will fight with you.
F	MAXIMUS	This isn't your battle.
M	JUBA	Better to die for a friend than to die for gold.
M	PROXIMO	Enjoy yourself, Madame... General, perform well and there will be riches for you.
F	LUCILLA	Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.
F	MAXIMUS	I knew your brother would send assassins. I didn't think he would send his best.
F	LUCILLA	Maximus, listen to me --
F	MAXIMUS	My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive.
F	LUCILLA	I knew nothing of that.
F	MAXIMUS	Don't lie to me.
F	LUCILLA	I wept for them.
F	MAXIMUS	Don't.
F	LUCILLA	Do you know what it is to be the daughter of the Emperor? I learned on the night my father had my husband killed. I loved my husband very much. Very... simply. He was a man who believed in the Republic. He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome and not conquering the world. One night my father had him strangled for conspiring with the Senate. My father never spoke of it. I never spoke of it. That is what it is to be the daughter of Rome.
F	LUCILLA	My son will live. He will survive this cursed bloodline. Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive. Empires come and go. Cities crumble to dust. Only family matters.
F	MAXIMUS	My son was innocent.
F	LUCILLA	So is mine.
F	MAXIMUS	I want your brother dead.
F	LUCILLA	So do I.
F	LUCILLA	My son will never be safe while he lives.
F	MAXIMUS	How do you plan it?
F	LUCILLA	The Senate is with us, and the City Guard. We have growing power in the streets. But we need a leader. Someone the people can --
F	MAXIMUS	So the crown passes to your son.
F	LUCILLA	No. So that my son will be safe. So that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back. Look into my eyes, Maximus, and believe what I say to you...
F	LUCILLA	By all the Gods, and in the name of my father who loved you, and in the name of the husband I loved... I swear to stand by your side in this now and always.
F	MAXIMUS	What is your son's name?
F	LUCILLA	Lucius Verus. Like his father.
F	MAXIMUS	I weep for him.
F	LUCILLA	Commodus plans to kill you in your next match in the arena. He's planning something. I will pray for you. As I have always done.
M	CASSIUS	... in his majestic charity the Emperor has deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final match. Returning to the Colosseum today... after five years in retirement... Caesar is pleased to bring you... THE ONLY UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN HISTORY... ... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!!
M	PROXIMO	Gods! That old Homicide! The Emperor must truly hate you.
F	MAXIMUS	What can you tell me?
M	PROXIMO	He cheats.
M	CASSIUS	And from the rocky promontories and martial bloodlines of Spain... representing the training lyceum of Proximo Antoninus... I give you... THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS!
M	MAXIMUS AND TIGER	We who are about to die salute you.
M	LUCIUS' VOICE	Is it true you're a General...?
F	MAXIMUS	I was a General.
M	LUCIUS	I saw you fight. The Carthage battle too. I've never seen so much courage.
F	MAXIMUS	It doesn't take courage to kill.
M	LUCIUS	My father was killed.
F	MAXIMUS	I'm sorry.
M	LUCIUS	He still comes to me in my dreams. Do you have a father?
F	MAXIMUS	I had a father. He wasn't really my father but I cared for him very much.
M	LUCIUS	I hope he comes to you in your dreams. My father and I ride horses in mine.
F	LUCILLA	Lucius, run along now. I need to talk to the General.
F	MAXIMUS	Where is my army?
F	LUCILLA	... Maximus will summon his army from Ostia and he will strike from the inside as his army strikes from the outside. But he insists that the Senate be present.
M	GAIUS	We've been ordered to attend.
F	LUCILLA	How many are with us?
M	GRACCHUS	About half. But once the tyrant is dead. All.
M	GRACCHUS	I want to meet him.
F	LUCILLA	I'll arrange it.
M	GAIUS	And what of the Emperor?
F	LUCILLA	He has withdrawn. He's not eating. He doesn't go out. He won't even see me... I don't know what tempests rage within him but...
M	GRACCHUS	We should fear for the blackest storm.
F	LUCILLA	Yes.
M	GAIUS	One question... who is to be the actual Regicide?
M	VIBIUS	You didn't kill him.
F	MAXIMUS	I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it.
M	KIDS	Maximus the Merciful! Maximus the Merciful!
F	MAXIMUS	Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival.
F	LUCILLA	And they will march on Rome for you?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes. But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else.
F	LUCILLA	Captain Marcellus will take it. And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome. Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard?
F	MAXIMUS	The Felix Regiment will never be defeated.
M	GRACCHUS	I only have one question for you, General... Why?
M	GRACCHUS	You will lead an army of your brothers on Rome. Many will die. Why?
F	MAXIMUS	I want Commodus dead.
M	GRACCHUS	That's not the reason. Tell me the truth.
F	MAXIMUS	Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream. I will die for that dream.
M	GRACCHUS	I knew the old man well. And I loved him very much. In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together. After he went to the wars and lost his way... I was very cruel. I tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of.
F	MAXIMUS	He did.
M	GRACCHUS	You can have no idea how much that means to me.
M	GRACCHUS	Any man who will die for a whispered dream deserves my respect. I honor you, General.
M	CENTURION	Madame, the Emperor would like to see you.
F	LUCILLA	Caesar...
M	COMMODUS	I am sorry to have kept you away... I needed this time to think...
F	LUCILLA	Of course...
M	COMMODUS	I limited my world to these four walls so as to let my mind free... again and again my mind settles on but one question... What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father?
M	COMMODUS	It is my responsibility to make the world as it should be. How is it I have made this world?
F	LUCILLA	Brother, do not be influenced by the mob. They are a great, faceless beast --
M	COMMODUS	They are not "the mob," Lucilla, they are the people. They are my children and all I want to do is love them.
M	COMMODUS	Our father loved Maximus... and I love him still... yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. And they love him for it. Just as Marcus loved him for it. Tell me why, Lucilla.
F	LUCILLA	They see themselves in him. They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his. They think he fights for them.
M	COMMODUS	And what do I do but fight for them?! I give them games to please them. I strangle dissent to give them peace. I empower the Praetorians to give them order. What more can I do?!
M	COMMODUS	Say I should fight him, in the arena. Let my children see who the Gods truly favor.
F	LUCILLA	And what if he should win?
M	COMMODUS	A God is more powerful than a man...
F	LUCILLA	Caesar, you let this unduly worry you. At best he is a passing fancy -- he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral -- he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears --
M	COMMODUS	But I need to know -- why do they love him?
F	LUCILLA	Mercy.
F	LUCILLA	He will not kill in the arena. He is merciful. As they all wish they were in their own hearts.
M	COMMODUS	And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too. For a moment... they are Gods. Offering life.
M	COMMODUS	But who can be more merciful than the Emperor of Rome?
M	COMMODUS	Brother... we've taken a sad path since we were children at Capri, have we not?
M	COMMODUS	For my own part... I am sorry it came to this. And to you alone of all men, I acknowledge my errors. And my regret. I shall live with my sin for all my days.
F	MAXIMUS	As will I, Commodus. As will I.
M	COMMODUS	As the first act of my contrition I offer you the wooden sword of freedom.
M	COMMODUS	Take it, brother. Stand at my side as a free man worthy of your ancestors.
F	MAXIMUS	I only have ancestors because of you, brother. You killed everything that ever lived alongside me.
M	COMMODUS	Take it, Maximus. Let us heal that fatal wound together.
F	MAXIMUS	This is the new home you cursed me to. And I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside.
M	COMMODUS	Will you always mistrust me?
F	MAXIMUS	Why don't you ask your father that?
F	MAXIMUS	I have more power as a slave in the arena than I could ever have as a free man. As the Colosseum goes, the people go. As the people go, the Empire goes.
M	COMMODUS	You think this is power? I could show you power, slave --
F	MAXIMUS	No, Caesar... I will show you.
F	MAXIMUS	The Felix Regiment will come from here. We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here. Once inside, my archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the Colosseum. I'll enter and join you -- we'll attack here --
F	MAXIMUS	-- a covert assault from within.
M	VIBIUS	We'll be killed.
F	MAXIMUS	Probably.
F	MAXIMUS	But if we aren't... think of the glory. Do you remember glory, Gladiator?
M	JUBA	And if we die that day -- we die free men worthy of our ancestors.
M	VIBIUS	You didn't know my ancestors. A rotten bunch.
F	MAXIMUS	Then be worthy of him. The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat.
M	JUBA	And impotent.
M	VIBIUS	If I die, I want a hundred whores at my funeral.
M	COMMODUS	Where is my sister?
M	HANDMAIDEN	She's out, sir...
M	COMMODUS	Where?
M	HANDMAIDEN	I... don't know, Caesar.
M	COMMODUS	Where is my sister?
F	MAXIMUS	Was it Centurion...? General...?
M	PROXIMO	Captain.
M	PROXIMO	How did you know?
F	MAXIMUS	A soldier knows a soldier.
M	PROXIMO	All that was a long time ago. Too much wine and too many women. And too much money.
F	MAXIMUS	No --
M	PROXIMO	This is who I am... You see? There was a time I would stand against ten men and never give an inch, spitting into the jaws of Hades all the while. There was a time my heart swelled to strap on the armor of Rome. But now...
M	PROXIMO	Now I am just an entertainer.
F	MAXIMUS	You said something to me once. You said in this life, we all die. All we can choose is how we die. And how we are remembered. Do you recall those words?
M	PROXIMO	Yes.
F	MAXIMUS	Then be remembered proudly. This is your time, Proximo. Stand at my side and be what you were. What you truly are. One last time.
M	PROXIMO	You might have spared yourself the speech, General. The lady Lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago!
F	MAXIMUS	You pox-ridden bastard -- !
M	PROXIMO	I am the richest trainer in the Empire! And I will let my gladiators do anything you like! Conspire away, General!
M	PROXIMO	But I tell you -- if you survive this madness I want you to go into business with me. I'll give you a quarter of my holdings.
F	MAXIMUS	A quarter?!
M	PROXIMO	A third. And not a hair more. And you'll have to start in the provinces! Cleaning up the lion shit!
F	MAXIMUS	You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man.
F	MAXIMUS	Lucilla --
F	LUCILLA	Don't even say it. I know it's dangerous -- but I had to see you. Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your message as you instructed.
F	MAXIMUS	Good.
F	LUCILLA	He says the City Guard will be ready at the south road at noon. They can only wait for an hour so --
F	MAXIMUS	You've told me this already.
F	LUCILLA	Did I? All right then. So everything is prepared. The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators -- the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena --
F	MAXIMUS	Lucilla... why are you here?
F	LUCILLA	Tell me honestly... please... do you think it will work?
F	MAXIMUS	No.
F	LUCILLA	Do you think we'll all die?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
F	LUCILLA	Will you swear something to me?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
F	LUCILLA	Will you swear it on the memory of your son?
F	MAXIMUS	Yes.
F	LUCILLA	By all that you have ever loved... swear that if you survive you will take my son out of Rome. Swear that you will go far away and never return.
F	MAXIMUS	I will.
F	MAXIMUS	And if I should not survive... swear to me that you will honor my family in your prayers always.
F	LUCILLA	I will.
F	LUCILLA	Had I not been the daughter of Rome...
F	MAXIMUS	Shhh... my heart breaks enough.
M	COMMODUS	Sister... join us. I've been reading to dear Lucius.
M	LUCIUS	I've been reading too.
M	COMMODUS	Yes, he's a very smart little boy. He'll make a grand Emperor one day.
M	COMMODUS	Join us, sister.
M	COMMODUS	We've been reading about the great Julius and his adventures in Egypt.
M	LUCIUS	She killed herself with a snake!
M	COMMODUS	And just wait until you hear what happened to some of our other ancestors! If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius. He was betrayed! By those closest to him... ... by his own blood... they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired...
M	COMMODUS	But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something dire. He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said: "Tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or I shall strike down those dearest to you. You shall watch as I bathe in their blood." And the bee knew he spoke the truth, for the Emperor always speaks the truth. And what do you think happened then, Lucius?
M	LUCIUS	I don't know, Uncle.
M	COMMODUS	The bee told him everything.
M	PROXIMO	Release them! Release them all! ARM THEM!
M	PROXIMO	Come --
F	MAXIMUS	But --
M	PROXIMO	If you want to live -- follow me --
M	VIBIUS	Go, Spaniard! We'll show these Roman dogs how gladiators fight!
M	PROXIMO	All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed --
M	JUBA	How did they know?
F	MAXIMUS	We were betrayed.
M	JUBA	I'll stay here. In case they follow.
M	JUBA	Go! Bring us the army!
M	PROXIMO	Quickly --
M	PROXIMO	Down that corridor is the butchery -- the blood sloughs lead to the Tiber. Gods watch over you.
F	MAXIMUS	You're not coming?
M	PROXIMO	They are killing my men!
M	PROXIMO	Gods... they're killing them all.
M	LUCIUS	What is that fire?
M	COMMODUS	Why that's a bonfire, Lucius. I arranged it just for you.
M	PRAETORIAN	Caesar...
M	COMMODUS	Oh... that's for my sister.
M	TITUS	By all the Gods...
F	MAXIMUS	Old friend...
M	TITUS	You're returned from Hades! By all the Gods!
F	MAXIMUS	Where is he?
F	MAXIMUS	I forgive you.
M	COMMODUS	Rome... This is the day that was foretold. This is the day when your father takes away all fear... With these hands I shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in peace. From this day forth let it be known that I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, have surmounted mortality. That I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, assume my destined place... at the side of the Gods.
M	COMMODUS	And as a righteous God, I shall ever protect you. I shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp it to my heart. So I have spoken! And let the heavens tremble at my might!
M	COMMODUS	This day I reclaim Rome for her people. I shall give you the rebirth of your Empire! Reborn and cleansed of her enemies!
M	COMMODUS	I will make a new Rome! Founded as it was at the beginning! Archers -- GIVE US BLOOD!
F	MAXIMUS	Throw down your weapons or we will kill you.
F	MAXIMUS	FELIX REGIMENT! DO HONOR TO YOUR ANCESTORS! I SALUTE YOU!
M	COMMODUS	As it was at the beginning so is it now. The great She-Wolf of Rome will again suckle us, again ravage our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD REBORN!
M	COMMODUS	So it was for Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, so shall it be for us! The great She-Wolf will --
F	LUCILLA	Remember your mother.
M	CENTURION BODY GUARD	Caesar -- we must go -- !
M	COMMODUS	GET THE BOY!
M	CENTURION BODY GUARD	THIS WAY, CAESAR!
F	MAXIMUS	Captain?
F	MAXIMUS	Where are they going?!
M	PROXIMO	This way!
M	COMMODUS	KILL THE BOY!
F	MAXIMUS	For my wife!
F	MAXIMUS	For my son!
F	MAXIMUS	For my father!
F	MAXIMUS	We who are about to die salute you.
M	GRACCHUS	General, the purple is yours if you so desire. The Senate will support you.
F	MAXIMUS	Rome... you are better than this. Look inside yourselves. I challenge you to find your true voice. Help the Senate speak for you. Make them your champion... And dare to think what could be.
F	MAXIMUS	I give you back the dream.
F	MAXIMUS	When everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal. Take them home.
F	MAXIMUS	It doesn't look it now... but soon we'll have it growing again... Next year there will be vines, and then there will be grapes... It will be alive.
