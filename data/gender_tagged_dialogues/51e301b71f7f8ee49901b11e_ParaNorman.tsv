M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ZOMBIE	Brains! CLOSE ON the woman as she raises her hands and SCREAMS.
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	What's happening now?
M	NORMAN	The zombie is eating her head, Grandma.
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	That's not very nice. What's he doing that for?
M	NORMAN	Because he's a zombie. That's what they do.
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	Well he's going to ruin his dinner. I'm sure if they just bothered to sit down and talk it through it'd be a different story. Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as Norman! Didn't I tell you to take out the garbage?
M	NORMAN	Coming, Dad!
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	Tell him to turn up the thermostat too, will ya? My feet are like ice. Norman nods to her and shuffles over to the kitchen door. Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Hi. Whatcha watching in there?
M	NORMAN	Sex and violence.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Oh. That's nice. Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Can't you be like other kids your age and pitch a tent in the yard, or have a healthy interest in carpentry?
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry...
M	NORMAN	I thought you said kids my age were too busy shoplifting and joyriding?
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Norman! He hefts the bag onto the floor and ties it in a knot. Breezing into the kitchen through the back door while
F	COURTNEY	Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d. Like, a seven pack at least. Ew! Watch it! She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Courtney, be nice.
F	COURTNEY	Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve him. I mean, she's nice and I really like her, but she's a complete loser. Yeah, I know. Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a
M	NORMAN	Dad? Grandma says, "Can you turn up the heating?" Her feet are cold. The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face,
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Now, Perry...
M	PERRY BABCOCK	How many times do we have to go through this, Son? Your grandmother is dead!
M	NORMAN	I know!
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Then why do you keep on talking to her?
M	NORMAN	Because she talks back!
F	COURTNEY	O-M-G, you are such a liar! ParaNorman 4.
M	NORMAN	I'm not making this up! I swear! She talks to me all the time!
F	COURTNEY	Oh yeah? Prove it! Norman levels her a look that says "you asked for this".
M	NORMAN	She said it's not very ladylike to hide photos of the High School quarterback with his shirt off in your underwear drawer. Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows.
F	COURTNEY	I knew it! You've been sneaking around in my personal stuff!
M	NORMAN	No I haven't! Grandma told me!
F	COURTNEY	You are the worst! Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Norman, I know you and Grandma were very close, but we all have to move on. Grandma's in a better place now.
M	NORMAN	No she's not, she's in the living room. Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Your grandmother was old and sick, and she died. That's all there is to it!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry, this is just part of the mourning process. ParaNorman 5.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Stop indulging him! I'm nothing if I'm not liberal, but that limp- wristed, hippie garbage needs to be nipped in the bud! Norman SIGHS and steps between his parents as they argue.
M	PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)	This behavior might be okay with your side of the family, but I'm not putting up with it anymore! Not me! Oh, not this again! PAN UP to find a light go on in Norman's bedroom window. Norman gets up off the bed and approaches the door.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	This isn't the West Coast, Sandra; people talk! They do!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)	He's just sensitive, Perry.
M	PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)	Oh please, "sensitive" is writing poetry and being lousy at team sports... not this! I won't have him turn out like that uncle of yours! If that crazy old tramp has been around here putting ideas in Norman's head...
M	SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)	Perry, no one's had anything to do with Uncle Prenderghast in years! I bet he doesn't even know what Norman looks like! Norman quietly closes the door, and the room goes black.
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	Not much time, not much time... He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and ZOOM IN to the photograph, hurtling past the Babcocks and Courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the ParaNorman 7. Norman is watched dubiously by the occasional passer-by
M	NORMAN	Good morning! Hey Bruce! How's it goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late for school. I need to go. Hi, nice to see you guys. Good morning. Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me. Pardon me. See ya. At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Hey there little buddy! C'mere! He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Yeah, good to see you! How you doin'? Hi Mrs Hardman. You look nice today. I like what you've done with your hair.
M	HAIRDRYER GHOST	Does anyone smell burning?
M	HIPPY GHOST	Hey, peace, man.
M	NORMAN	Totally.
M	CIVIL WAR GHOST	As you were, soldier.
M	NORMAN	Sir, yes sir!
M	GREASER GHOST	Yo Norman, you playin' hookie?
M	NORMAN	No no, I'm just late for school. Sorry, I gotta go. How you doin'? ParaNorman 8.
M	MOBSTER GHOST	Hey, how you doin'? A little further along Norman nods pleasantly to the
M	NORMAN	Hi! How's it hanging?
M	PARACHUTIST GHOST	Ho ho! Haven't heard that one before. Well, it's a nice day. The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	Watch and learn. "Parking violation" is my middle name.
M	DEPUTY DWAYNE	Really? I thought it was Rhona. They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman; a gauntlet A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions, A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start.
M	ALVIN	Hey, ghost jerk! You know what? Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
M	NORMAN	What do you want, Alvin?
M	ALVIN	Why don't you see some more ghosts, goober? ParaNorman 10. The kids LAUGH uproariously, encouraging Alvin to show
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	Hey! Hey! Norman! Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	Talk to that. The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER.
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	That is so Alvin! The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
M	PUG	Loser!
M	ALVIN	That was good, right guys? Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as
M	NORMAN	Flies don't talk. Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy,
M	SALMA	Neil, come on. Let's go. ParaNorman 11.
M	MRS HENSCHER	You stink of illiteracy! Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any of you know anything about the history of this town? Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed.
M	MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)	Puritans were strict and devout settlers, who came here to build a home, a place without sin. What is it now Salma? Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
M	SALMA	Why is the witch always a hideous old crone with a pointy hat and a broomstick? I don't believe it's historically accurate, Mrs Henscher! Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
M	MRS HENSCHER	It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to sell postcards and key chains. So let's try it again. Top of page six, Norman. Norman skips ahead on his scroll.
M	NORMAN	The founding fathers of Blithe Hollow discovered an evil witch amongst them...
M	MRS HENSCHER	No no, Norman, with gusto! Like this! Waving her arms theatrically, she bellows Norman's lines,
M	MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)	They put her on trial and hanged her! ParaNorman 12.
M	MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)	But the vengeful witch cursed her accusers, seven of them in all, to die a horrible and gruesome death, and rise from their graves as the living dead; their souls doomed to an eternity of damnation! Now I want you to try that again, but with conviction! My reputation is at stake here, and I won't have this turn out like that wretched Kabuki debacle of oh-nine! As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
M	MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)	Norman! Are you listening to me, boy? Norman is brought back to the real world with a start,
M	NORMAN	Sorry, Mrs Henscher.
M	MRS HENSCHER	So am I. Now, unless there's any other issues, let us resume... They put her on trial and hanged her! Neil turns excitedly to Norman.
M	NEIL	Ooh! This is my moment! He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around, Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER.
M	ALVIN	Boom, baby!
M	NEIL	Sorry! Mrs Henscher flings her script into the air, her face
M	MRS HENSCHER	Oh, you useless bunch of... The school bell RINGS drowning out her howling voice.
M	NEIL	Norman, wait up!
M	NORMAN	I keep telling you, Neil. I like to be alone.
M	NEIL	So do I. Let's do it together! You shouldn't let them get you down. They always do stuff like that to me.
M	NORMAN	Why?
M	NEIL	Because I'm fat. And my allergies make my eyes leak. And I sweat when I walk too fast. And I have a lunchbox with a kitten on it. And I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff.
M	NORMAN	Doesn't it bother you? ParaNorman 14.
M	NEIL	Nah. You can't stop bullying, it's part of human nature. If you were bigger and more stupid, you'd probably be a bully too. It's called "survival of the thickest".
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (O.S.)	Psssst! The boys stop. It seems to be coming from the witch.
M	NEIL	That statue just "pissst" at us! Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	You know who I am?
M	NEIL	The weird stinky old bum who lives up the hill?
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	I was asking him.
M	NORMAN	Yes. I know. I was told not to talk to you. Sorry. Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	And you know why you're not supposed to talk to me? Norman tries to back away.
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)	I can see ghosts too! And I know that's not all you've been seeing lately, is it? Bad omens? Things you can't quite explain? Strange faces peering through the veil? Norman's eyes widen further. ParaNorman 15.
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)	And I'll bet no one told you about the witch's curse, did they?
M	NORMAN	Actually, we're learning about it in school..? I'm a tree! Mr Prenderghast impatiently turns his back on Neil and
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	There's something you really need to know! This is the most important thing you will ever hear! The fate of everyone depends on it! Now listen close... The witch's curse is real, and you're the one who has to stop it! Mr Prenderghast grabs Norman's arm and leans closer.
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)	You've gotta use your gift of talking to the dead! He breaks into a HACKING COUGH, face turning beet red and
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)	Because if you don't the witch's ghost... And this is the most important thing of all... You have to go up to the old graveyard and... Leave him alone! An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to
M	NEIL (CONT'D)	Don't make me throw this hummus! It's spicy! Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	This ain't done with! You'll see it soon enough! Watch for the sign! As he hobbles away, Neil peers down the street after the
M	NEIL	Jeez, what a dirty old creep!
M	NORMAN	He's my uncle.
M	NEIL	So is it true?
M	NORMAN	What? Norman just stares at him.
M	NEIL	Can you see ghosts? Like, everywhere? All the time?
M	NORMAN	Uh, yeah?
M	NEIL	Awesome! Do you think you can see my dog Bub? He was run over by an animal rescue van. Tragic and ironic. We buried him in the yard. Could you see him? Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback.
M	NORMAN	Maybe.
M	NEIL	Sweet! Come on!
M	MITCH	Neil? That you? ParaNorman 17.
M	NEIL	Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play with the dead dog in the garden and we're not even gonna have to dig him up first! Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with
M	MITCH	What'd you say? Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman,
M	MITCH (CONT'D)	Neil, isn't he that weird kid? Y'know, "Look at me, I talk to ghosts so people will pay attention to me." Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically.
M	NEIL	Can you stop doing that? It's kinda stupid.
M	MITCH	to be hanging out with weird people. That's a tip. Neil scowls at his brother.
M	NEIL	Don't blow this for me, Mitch. This one's not weird. He talks to dead people. Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his
M	NEIL	He's around here somewhere... So does everyone come back as a ghost? ParaNorman 18. Norman hesitates. This level of interest is new to him.
M	NORMAN	No. My grandma told me it's usually people who still have stuff to figure out. Or sometimes it's the ones who died suddenly, or in a bad way. A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Bub?
M	NEIL	Is he there? How's he look? Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs
M	NORMAN	Uh... good. Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	He's happy to see you. Who's a good boy, huh? Good boy! Can he feel it if I pet him?
M	NORMAN	Yeah, I guess. Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Uh... that's not his chin. Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up.
M	NEIL	Go get it!
M	NORMAN	He can't fetch it, y'know. ParaNorman 19.
M	NEIL	Yeah well, it's still fun. Good boy! Bring it back! Go get it, Bub! Good boy! CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back Why don't you try?
M	NORMAN	`Cos I don't really, uh... You can go.
M	NEIL	No, no, it's fun! Try it!
M	NORMAN	No I don't want to.
M	NEIL	You throw it. It's really easy.
M	NORMAN	No it's okay. You can throw it.
M	NEIL	No, c'mon, it's really fun.
M	NORMAN	Here. You go first.
M	NEIL	No, you try it. I already went like fifty times.
M	NORMAN	Okay, what do I do?
M	NEIL	You get the stick, you pull it back, and you throw it!
M	NORMAN	Neil? Sorry! As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back
M	NEIL	I fetched it! ParaNorman 20. CLOSE ON NORMAN, as a smile creeps across his face and he
M	NORMAN	Are you okay?
M	MR PRENDERGHAST	I'll show him, and that scary little fat kid... He shakily rummages around the collected papers and
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)	Doesn't he realize we're running out of t... With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest, Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit
M	MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)	No! Not yet! Not yet! He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body.
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Aw, nuts. ParaNorman 21.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Great, now we'll never get to remember this moment. ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her
M	SALMA	I curse you accusers to die a horrible and gruesome death and rise from your graves as the living dead; your souls doomed to an eternity of damnation! The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead
M	KIDS	Kill the witch! Kill the witch! Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Gosh, aren't they adorable? Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to He looks down from it and catches Neil's eye. Neil makes
M	NEIL	What?
M	KIDS	Kill the witch! Kill the witch! The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows
M	NORMAN	Oh no! Not again! All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot
M	PURITAN	Witch! We know you're out there! Norman stands on a twig which, naturally, CRACKS loudly,
M	PURITAN (CONT'D)	There!
M	NORMAN	No!
M	PURITAN	Witch. More figures emerge from out of the darkness, wielding ParaNorman 23. Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a
M	TREE	The dead are coming! Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away, but the A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere.
M	NEIL (O.S.)	Hey buddy! Are you okay? Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's He continues running directly off the edge of the stage For a moment no one knows quite how to react. Mrs
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Norman!
M	MITCH	Did he say the dead are coming? No, no, no! Everyone jumps as Norman abruptly sits up, eyes wild.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	The tree told me! ParaNorman 24. Perry's face drains of color while the other parents
M	PERRY BABCOCK	This is where it stops! It's one thing being a mental case in front of your family, but not the whole freaking town! There's not gonna be any more talking to ghosts, or grandmas, or, or... what is it now?
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	I think it's trees.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	You're grounded! You hear me? Perry pulls the car up in the Babcock's drive and gruffly
M	NORMAN	This is ridiculous. I wish everyone could see what I see! I didn't ask to be born this way! Perry mutters as he slams his door shut.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Funny, neither did we. Norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut. A beat as she sees the pain in her son's face.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Y'know, sometimes people say things that seem mean, but they do it because they're afraid.
M	NORMAN	He's my dad. He shouldn't be afraid of me. ParaNorman 25. Sandra's eyes are filled with sorrow.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	He's not afraid of you. He's afraid for you. Sadly, Norman climbs out of the car.
M	KID #1	Look! It's AbNorman!
M	KID #2	What'd the tree tell you today, Norman?
M	KID #3	Are the dead coming soon, Norman? An overhead bulb casts a dim light over chipped wall CLOSE ON Alvin, sitting on the toilet in the next stall Norman sits on the lid of the toilet, pulling his knees ANGLE ON toilet paper in an industrial-sized roll. It Norman GASPS as Mr Prenderghast's face stares up at him
M	NORMAN	You died?!
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Yeah, but I got unfinished business here!
M	NORMAN	Ew! Couldn't you use another stall?
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	My ghost isn't going anywhere until I pass on my duty to another! And that would be you!
M	NORMAN	Me? No, you must have it wrong!
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Oh it's you all right! I've been holding back the witch's curse for years, but now I'm dead. It has to be you!
M	NORMAN	But I... I don't know what any of it means! ParaNorman 27. Before Norman's eyes the bathroom stall and everything
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	It means the past is coming back to haunt you! Time is running out! The anniversary of the witch's death is tonight. Her ghost is going to wake up, and when she does she'll raise the dead! You gotta keep her in her grave! The toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath Norman's
M	NORMAN	But I'm just a kid! How am I supposed to stop it? In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Read from the book at the spot the witch was buried!
M	NORMAN	What book?
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	The one in my hands! Norman looks at the ghost's wispy hands.
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)	Not these hands, my other hands! The me that's at home in my study starting to smell a little funny! Norman looks sick and overwhelmed, but the ghost doesn't
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)	Get the book and read from it! Before the sun sets tonight!
M	NORMAN	But this is crazy!
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Do I look crazy to you? Norman pauses a beat. Mr Prenderghast is floating upside
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)	Tell me you'll do this!
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Swear!
M	NORMAN	Y-you mean like the "f" word?
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	I mean promise!
M	NORMAN	Okay, okay, I promise...
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	That'll do! Mr Prenderghast's ghost begins to disappear, bubbling and
M	NORMAN	No! Mr Prenderghast, wait! Alvin, hearing only Norman's voice, gingerly peeks around
M	PRENDERGHAST GHOST	Sorry kid, I'm done here! I'm free! I'm finally free!
M	NORMAN	Wait! No, you can't leave now! Please! I don't understand. Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment, face scrunched From the floor, Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Uh... yeah. You might want to give that a few minutes. He grabs his bag and runs out of the room.
M	NEIL	Norman? Alvin tears around the corner in pursuit, but Neil stands
M	NEIL (CONT'D)	Hey! What's the big deal?
M	ALVIN	Don't get your bra in a twist, fat boy, this has nothing to do with you! Keep out of my way!
M	NEIL	Or what?
M	ALVIN	Or I'll punch you in the boobs!
M	NEIL	I don't have boobs. These are pectorals! Alvin jabs him in the chest.
M	NEIL (CONT'D)	Ow! My boobs! Neil swiftly steps aside. Alvin reaches the door to see Norman disappearing along
M	ALVIN	You're dead, freakshow! Do you hear me? D-E-D! DEAD! You're gonna be so dead you're gonna have to talk to yourself when you're dead!
M	PERRY BABCOCK	I really don't think we should be leaving him.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry, you promised me a meal that someone else microwaved. ParaNorman 30.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	He's probably up there right now fiddling with his ouija, or his orbs, or whatever it is he's got up there. This is not good. His cell phone BEEPS from his pocket, giving him a start. A figure stands motionless in the yard below, sheets of Norman GASPS and jumps back. With a frown, he re-emerges and opens the window.
M	NEIL	You wanna play some hockey? Norman SIGHS.
M	NORMAN	I've kinda got other things on my mind right now. Neil looks a little uncomfortable.
M	NEIL	Is it all that walking dead stuff again?
M	NORMAN	Mr Prenderghast appeared to me in the bathroom!
M	NEIL	Ew. ParaNorman 31.
M	NORMAN	No, his spirit! He says the witch's curse is real and I have to go up to the old graveyard to stop it! Before the sun sets tonight! Neil shifts uneasily as he processes.
M	NEIL	So you wanna come play a bit later?
M	NORMAN	Didn't you hear what I just said?!
M	NEIL	Yeah, but I thought my idea was less likely to get us eaten. Norman knows he's on his own in this.
M	NORMAN	Just go home, Neil. I'm better off on my own anyway.
M	NEIL	But...
M	NORMAN	Go home! Norman reaches up and closes the window. Neil's shoulders Across the room, his Grandma materializes, and squints
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	Jeez, who rattled your chains?
M	NORMAN	No one. Norman isn't in the mood for any more discussion.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Dad says I'm not supposed to talk to you any more, Grandma.
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	Jackass. If I were a poltergeist I'd throw something at his head. Y'know, by rights I'm supposed to be frolicking in paradise with your grandfather, but I'm not. ParaNorman 32. Norman looks up as she drifts closer to the bed.
M	NORMAN	So why did you stay?
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	I was never one for frolicking. I'll bet there's no cable or canasta up there either. Besides, I promised I'd always look out for you. She smiles, floating in a sitting position at the end of
M	NORMAN	So it's your... duty?
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	In a manner of speaking...
M	NORMAN	And you'd do it no matter what?
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	Of course.
M	NORMAN	Even if it was something really scary... Grandma eyes him curiously.
M	GRANDMA BABCOCK	There's nothing wrong with being scared Norman, so long as you don't let it change who you are. Norman thinks this over, then smiles up at her again. She ParaNorman 33.
F	COURTNEY	So I said to her, "Girl, come back and talk to me when your basket toss gets twelve thousand hits on YouTube!" Yeah, no, I said that. Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol. Tonight's gonna be a total yawn. From downstairs, a door SLAMS. Courtney frowns, puts her
M	COURTNEY (CONT'D)	Norman?!
M	COURTNEY (O.S.)	You better not be sneaking out you little weirdo! A faint CLATTERING sound down the road grows louder. He cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is
M	NORMAN	Hello? Mr Prenderghast? Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly CLOSE ON Norman's face as he swallows nervously and steps
M	NORMAN	Let go! Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body He pauses and stares out across weathered tombstones Clutching the book tight, Norman wrenches open the heavy Norman pushes through the thick bushes into a secluded
M	NORMAN	This is it! The sun continues its descent, casting an ever
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Read from the book, stop the curse, go home and pretend this never happened. Norman steels himself, opens the book and starts to read.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	"Once upon a time, in a far-off land there lived a king and queen in a magnificent castle..." He pauses, confused by what he's reading.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	What? A fairy... tale...? A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere, whipping
M	ALVIN	What ya got there, Geekula? Norman launches himself at the book, but Alvin holds him
M	NORMAN	Give it back!
M	ALVIN	Can't wait to see everybody's faces when they hear about this one! ParaNorman 36.
M	NORMAN	No, don't! Alvin!
M	ALVIN	Hey! Nobody makes me miss out on a possible date with a girl that almost had some interest in talking to me. Yeah? Thought so! You got nothin' to say!
M	NORMAN	Uh-oh.
M	ALVIN	Dang straight "uh-oh". That's what happens when Alvin gets around here. Uh-oh is that Alvin? Uh-oh Alvin's gonna make me run home to mommy. As Norman twists and wrestles against the bully the There is an enormous RUMBLE and a flash of lightning
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	Uh-oh. What is that? The wind has picked up, HOWLING through the gravestones.
M	NORMAN	It's her! Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light, and Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog ParaNorman 37. Silence, then the ground begins to RUMBLE beneath their
M	ALVIN	What's that sound? Norman watches, horrified, as the wet earth atop one of The boys find themselves backed up against another
M	NORMAN	Once upon a time in a far-off... Once upon a... In a...
M	ALVIN	Make it stop right now, please!
M	NORMAN	It's not working! The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL, but Norman frowns, ParaNorman 38.
M	ALVIN	Norman? What are you doing? I think I peed my pants! Survival instincts finally kick in and Alvin makes a run
M	NORMAN	Wait! Norman follows, leapfrogging over headstones.
M	MITCH (O.S.)	Neil! Will you get the door?
M	NEIL	I'm busy! Are you freeze-framing Mom's aerobics DVD again? ANGLE ON TV, with a still image of a Lycra-clad
M	NEIL	No! The doorbell RINGS again. Neil! Would it kill you to get off your butt and answer the door?
F	COURTNEY	I'm gonna kill them. She impatiently leans down to push open the mail slot.
M	COURTNEY (CONT'D)	I know you're in there! Slumber party's over, dorks! The door opens and she finds herself face to navel with
M	MITCH	Um, can I help you?
F	COURTNEY	Hell yeah. Courtney catches herself and quickly affects a LAUGH.
M	COURTNEY (CONT'D)	Sorry to bug you so late, but does, erm... ...Neil live here?
M	MITCH	Yeah, he's my brother.
F	COURTNEY	Oh wow! That's great! Your brother and my brother are like best friends! I'm Courtney. She tries to regain her composure as Mitch turns away.
M	MITCH	Hey Neil! You come here a minute? There's a girl asking for you. Neil's face emerges dubiously from a room down the hall.
F	COURTNEY	Hey there! How ya doin'... little guy...
M	NEIL	Neil?
F	COURTNEY	Yeah, Neil. Do you know where Norman is? He kinda disappeared.
M	NEIL	Oh no... ...idea! I have no idea where he is. Sorry. Bye! Neil goes to turn around but his brother stops him short.
M	MITCH	Whoa, Neil! Better start talking, buddy. ParaNorman 40.
M	NEIL	I didn't really think he was serious about going up to the old graveyard on his own!
F	COURTNEY	So Norman!
M	MITCH	Oh, man. That place is bad news! Total slasher movie vibe! Why'd he go up there?
M	NEIL	I don't know. Maybe we should go look for him.
M	MITCH	I told you he was trouble. Sorry. But I did.
F	COURTNEY	No, it's fine. He sucks. But I really gotta make sure he doesn't die or anything tonight. Will you help me? Please? Mitch gets an eyeful of her best damsel in distress act,
M	MITCH	Okay... I guess I should go get some clothes on. Courtney gives a disappointed WHINE as he heads off down
M	NEIL	Uh, is Norman in trouble?
M	ALVIN	brains?!
M	NORMAN	I think you'll be safe.
M	ALVIN	Oh, thank God! ParaNorman 41. He manages to think this through, and frowns.
M	NORMAN	I don't get it! Why didn't it work? He opens the book and leafs through page after page of
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	"The Story of Sleeping Beauty". This doesn't make any sense! His mind racing, Norman heads off along the hallway.
M	ALVIN	Wait! Where are you going?
M	NORMAN	Mr Prenderghast, I don't understand! Tell me what to do!
M	ALVIN	Dude, what are you doing?
M	NORMAN	He told me to read from the book to stop the curse! I thought it was a spell or something, but... Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghast's
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Come on! There has to be something...
M	ALVIN	I really need to get home! I've got like a seriously early curfew. ParaNorman 42.
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	My mom gets really upset when I'm not... Something CLUNKS loudly from down the hall, sending Alvin
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	We gotta defend ourselves! We gotta shoot them in the head with like silver stakes or something! I'm way too awesome to get eaten! Norman, are you listening to me? You really have to do something! Norman uncovers a couple of faded photographs of the old
M	NORMAN	Seven victims... Frowning, Norman glances up and sees a page from an old Another THUMP from down the hall. Seven graves. The witch's grave! It wasn't there! He turns to Alvin.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	I was reading the book in the wrong place! Down the hallway, another loud THUMP.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Hide! ParaNorman 43. There is a loud SCREAM as Alvin, unable to contain Norman takes this chance to follow, but the Dead Judge Norman steps sideways to run past it, but the corpse does ParaNorman 44. Alvin, still screaming, looks down to see Norman beside The Dead Judge leads the advance of zombies down the hall
M	NORMAN	Come on!
F	COURTNEY	And she said I could totally consider a career in formation swimming. But I was like, "I wanna do something that helps people less fortunate than me", thank you very much, y'know, like the poor or people who are like dying or ugly or something, `cuz I really think that ecology and world peace are like totally important today. Do you use free weights? Your deltoids are huge.
M	MITCH	I've never used deltoids in my life, I swear. You can test me. Neil lies back in his seat, eyes rolling.
M	NEIL	Kill me now.
F	COURTNEY	Thank you for doing this Mitch. He means an awful lot to me. I love him like he was a brother.
M	NEIL	He is your brother. Courtney counters the backseat barbs by smiling demurely,
M	MITCH	Whoa! Look at that sky! ParaNorman 45. The wooded hill rises steeply a few miles in front of
M	NEIL	Look out! Mitch slams on the breaks, twisting the wheel.
M	MITCH	Oh no! Mitch fights to control the van as Courtney SCREAMS.
M	NEIL	That was Norman! Shaken, Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of
M	MITCH	Is everyone okay? Courtney and Neil answer in unison, both of them upside
M	COURTNEY NEIL	No! No! Mitch, trying to stay calm, looks in his rear-view mirror
M	MITCH	Er... hello, sir? He hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench. A
F	COURTNEY	Is he dead or what?
M	MITCH	I... I don't know! He's not moving! The figure's head lets out a faint GASP.
M	MITCH (CONT'D)	He's still breathing! Mitch reaches out to gently lift the figure's head but as
F	COURTNEY	So he's okay?
M	MITCH	Uh... not exactly.
F	COURTNEY	What? What did you just say? Mitch looks from the head back to the van, then at the
M	MITCH	Does anyone know CPR? Further down the road, Norman runs back toward the van,
M	NORMAN	Run! The head in Mitch's hands suddenly GASPS again, opening As if struck by the same blow, the rest of the corpse Alvin and Norman run past him toward the van, bustling
M	MITCH	Did you see that?
F	COURTNEY	That was insane!
M	MITCH	I know, right? I kicked that like a hundred yards!
F	COURTNEY	Norman, what just happened?!
M	ALVIN	Zombies! I swear, okay? We saw them burst out of their graves! For real! He realizes Mitch and Courtney are staring at him, and Just so you know, I totally saved his life, and I could totally save yours. Sorry, who are you?
M	ALVIN (O.S.)	I'm Alvin. I'm in his class. Norman, not so easily distracted from the problem at hand
M	NORMAN	Uh, guys... maybe we should actually drive away now.
M	MITCH	Oh, right. ParaNorman 48. Mitch starts the engine with a YELL, just as the nearest A beat as the smoke clears. The soot-covered zombies
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	Pesky kids with their cell phones burning up the oh-zone, that's what this is! She finishes her shake and throws the non-recyclable cup Mitch's van shoots past at high speed in a cloud of dust.
M	SHERIFF HOOPER (CONT'D)	What the..? Hooper watches the van tear away, the dark shape of the
F	COURTNEY	I just knew something like this was going to happen tonight!
M	MITCH	You did? Wow, `cos that zombie bit really threw me. Courtney turns in her seat and glares at her brother.
F	COURTNEY	Why d'you have to go and get everyone involved in all your weird stuff?!
M	NORMAN	Well, you weren't supposed to follow me, were you?
M	NEIL	Sorry. My fault. When I'm nervous I get mouth diarrhoea.
M	ALVIN	Ha ha! Diarrhoea!
F	COURTNEY	Oh my gosh, I think I'm having an aneurism! This is so typical of you!
M	NORMAN	You don't understand! I'm the only one who can stop this, Courtney!
F	COURTNEY	Oh, I understand! I understand that this is all getting completely out of... The van's sunroof is suddenly ripped open, and the Dead The Dead Judge leans further into the van, MOANING Norman shrinks back as the zombie GROANS horribly. Alvin disappears behind the back seat with a WHIMPER, but
M	NEIL	Whaddawedo? Whaddawedo? Mitch?!
M	MITCH	I don't know! I don't know!
M	NEIL	You're the oldest!
M	MITCH	Not mentally! Mitch hears a SIREN wail out behind him, and looks in his
M	MITCH (CONT'D)	Oh great. The cops. Hooper pulls level with the passenger seat window, waving
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	Pull over the vehicle! The Dead Judge leans further into the van, Neil hanging
F	COURTNEY	Norman! How do we stop them?! Norman looks again at the book in his hands.
M	NORMAN	I'm supposed to read from the book at the witch's grave!
M	NEIL	We've got to go back to the graveyard?
M	NORMAN	She wasn't buried with the others. I don't know where else to look...
F	COURTNEY	Well you better think of something quick! Norman wracks his brain.
M	NEIL	I have an idea! ParaNorman 51. Salma talks into her cell phone with an expression of
M	SALMA	So Norman, let me get this straight; you guys all go on this big supernatural adventure and you're calling me in the middle of the night because you need someone to help you do your homework? Norman talks into his cell phone, occasionally ducking as
M	NORMAN	Uh... yeah. The van lurches, flipping the Judge up and over the front The Dead Judge slides slowly down the windscreen of the
F	COURTNEY	Mitch, do something! Mitch flicks on the windscreen wipers, which wipe the ParaNorman 52. Behind them, Neil SQUEALS as the dismembered arm crawls Norman holds the book up as a shield, and manages to swat Norman shouts pleadingly into the phone as he and Neil
M	NORMAN	Salma! We need to find out where the witch is buried! I went to the old graveyard but her grave wasn't there!
M	SALMA	Well, duh. People found guilty of witchcraft weren't considered people anymore. Norman, your witch was buried someplace else... in an unmarked grave! If you cared to pay attention some of the time, you would know that we covered this in fifth grade history class.
M	NORMAN	Salma! Please! Hurry! Y'know, I would Google this myself if there wasn't a 300 year old dead guy trying to rip my face off! With a SIGH, Salma types at her computer.
M	SALMA	Okay. It says here she was tried in the old Town Hall on Main Street. There may be a record of her execution and burial in their archives. ParaNorman 53. Norman listens intently then shouts over to Mitch, still
M	NORMAN	Quick! She said go to the Town Hall! Close on his heels, Hooper swerves her bike around in At the bottom of a long driveway, spotlit by a street She looks up from her garbage as the zombies approach. Henscher SCREAMS, bolting down the street like a runaway A little way behind, Hooper careens precariously in the Alvin lifts his face tentatively over the edge of the ParaNorman 54.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	I really think it might help if you tried to see things from his point of view.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	I don't want to.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry, not believing in the Afterlife is like not believing in Astrology.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	I have no idea what you're talking about. Seriously, where did you learn that?
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Calm down. Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS. Scattering lawn ornaments, plastic garden toys and deck Moments later, the Babcocks' station wagon pulls around He leaps out of the car as the van drives away.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Delinquent drivers! Where are the police when you need them? Hooper's bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the They all turn to see the van's rear doors ripped open. The zombie lunges toward the startled kids, and MOANS. ParaNorman 56. It bounces down the hill, flipping over and over, the Somewhat the worse for wear, it eventually comes to a
M	MITCH	Oh my gosh! I'm gonna be sick!
F	COURTNEY	Oh, I broke a nail! As Alvin climbs out, he gingerly holds up the Judge's
M	ALVIN	Yeah! Alvin the zombie slayer! I got you... The hand suddenly bends back on itself, slaps him on the Mitch sizes up what's left of his van, and bids a tearful Baby, I'm so sorry. You'll be alright. We're gonna get through this together. Courtney pouts moodily when she realizes the tender words Norman looks up at the sky. A thick bank of cloud looms
M	NORMAN	Uh oh. C'mon!
M	NEIL	Oh yeah! Neil HUMS his very own action movie score as he runs to ParaNorman 57.
F	COURTNEY	Perfect. Now the geeks are in charge. The kids make toward the parking lot exit. VARIOUS ANGLES ON the garish town center nightlife -A corpse stands agog before a billboard. The poster is ParaNorman 58. -A group of loitering teens cluster in a group, some
M	SLOB GUY	See! I told you! Zombies! It's the witch's curse! Everyone in the street freezes in place, wide-eyed.
M	SWEET GIRL	Mama?
M	RAPPER GUY	What? A couple of the zombies exchange glances, waiting for the
M	GUCCI LADY	What should we do? Barely skipping a beat, the townsfolk shift seamlessly
M	CRYSTAL	Kill them in the head! Within seconds, the seedy-looking townsfolk have armed threateningly, and the mob advances on the group of Having SNAPPED his head back onto his neck, the Judge
M	NORMAN	Hurry! This way! Norman leads the way, but stops dead as they run headlong
F	COURTNEY	Oh, this is awful! The zombies are, like, eating everyone! Norman points beyond the bedlam to the dark shape of the
M	NORMAN	C'mon! They skirt around the edge of Main Street, avoiding After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the It is an old timber building, surrounded by graceless
M	NORMAN	Is everyone alright? Nobody got bitten? Neil flops down heavily against the statue, panting and I bid dy tongue! Dud dat count? Norman moves toward the steps leading up to the Town Another flash of lightning paints the kids' shadows
M	NORMAN	Does anyone know how to pick a lock? Everyone immediately looks at Alvin.
M	ALVIN	Sure. Picking locks is my thing. Alvin walks over to a notice board beside the door, upon
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	Boom.
M	NORMAN	This is it! ParaNorman 61.
M	NEIL	This is?
M	NORMAN	Now we can find out where the witch was buried! Norman pushes his shoulder against the door and steps
M	NORMAN	Uh-oh. Courtney follows, faking enthusiasm.
F	COURTNEY	Great! I'm super psyched! This is turning into the most fun night ever! The overhead light clicks on as Alvin steps into the room
M	ALVIN	Man. Zombies take over the world and we lock ourselves in a library. Are you kidding me? There's an adult video store just across the street! Neil is more optimistic, and brightly makes his way over
M	NEIL	This'll be a piece of cake, you'll see. He pauses, and frowns, squinting up his eyes as he reads Page... One... Okay, page one. Mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf. He
M	MITCH	I really hate these places. Norman sizes up the masses of documents all around them,
M	NORMAN	Come on! No, that's not it. Time is running out!
M	SLOB GUY	Ain't room for no more zombies in this town! Standing behind him, Teddy agrees with a slack-jawed
M	TEDDY	Yeah.
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	Would've been a quiet night too, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids. Huh! As Perry and Sandra exchange uneasy glances, Hooper
M	SHERIFF HOOPER (CONT'D)	Sweet baby jinkies! Crystal turns and fires into the street, taking out a ParaNorman 63. Sheriff Hooper is outraged, and snatches the gun out of
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	What do you think you're doing, firing at civilians? That is for the police to do!
M	DEPUTY DWAYNE	It's okay Sheriff, we've only been shooting at the dead ones! It's the living dead, come to take us all to Hell! We gotta stop them before they get away! The Dead Judge looks up at the sky. The turgid The Judge motions to the other zombies to hurry, and
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	Move along now people, there isn't anything to see here! The townsfolk around her refuse to be allayed by this.
M	MRS HENSCHER	I saw them! I saw them! The zombies are in the Town Hall! The information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire. ParaNorman 64.
M	MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)	Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war! The faces around her don't react; waiting patiently for a
M	MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)	Let's rip `em apart! Mrs Henscher points the crowd toward the Town Hall. Norman sits on the floor flipping through sheet after
F	COURTNEY	We're not going to find it in here, Norman! This is useless!
M	ALVIN	Yeah, I know, and it's also really boring.
M	MITCH	I thought I was driving the van. No one told me I was gonna have to do this other dumb stuff.
M	NORMAN	If I'd known there was so much reading involved, I would have brought a completely different group of people who hate me. Neil suddenly YELLS out victoriously. Everyone turns to
M	NEIL	Yes! Book number one! Finished! That is right, twenty six pages, oh yeah! Everyone GROANS and turns back to their bickering.
F	COURTNEY	I can't believe this is your plan! I'm gonna get bitten and start eating peoples' brains! I'm supposed to be Vegan! Mitch suddenly SHOUTS out from the doorway.
M	MITCH	Guys! There's something moving out there! I think it's the zombies! Hide!
M	MITCH	Oh, no it's not. It's just grown- ups. Hide!
M	MITCH	That sound. Y'know what that is? That's not awesome... things...
M	NORMAN	Guys, come on!
M	ALVIN	Just give it up, weiner!
M	NORMAN	We have to keep trying! ParaNorman 66.
F	COURTNEY	We tried and look what happened! I'm scared, Norman, and I can't listen to this any more. Norman looks at the faces in front of him. The kids are Norman's brow furrows.
M	NORMAN	You never listen! No one ever listens! I'm scared too, but I've still gotta do this.
F	COURTNEY	I do too listen! And whatever it was you just said, it's not working! You think you're going to go out there and do your talking to the dead thing and this is all going to be okay? What are you going to do, ask the zombies not to eat you?
M	NORMAN	I should've known you wouldn't understand! No one ever does!
F	COURTNEY	Norman, you need to stop all this weird stuff and start living in the real world!
M	NORMAN	Everyone in the real world thinks I'm a freak! And you know what, maybe they're right, maybe I am a freak! But I never asked for your help... just go! Get out! Courtney, Mitch and Alvin back off a half step as Norman
M	MITCH	Jeez, that was dramatic. Courtney shoots him a look as if she's about to fight She turns to go, snapping at the other kids behind her.
F	COURTNEY	C'mon! ParaNorman 67. One by one, the kids turn and file out, but Neil still
M	NEIL	I'm not going anywhere. You can't make me. Mitch shrugs and picks his brother up, scooping him under
M	MITCH	Dude, you're really heavy.
M	NEIL	I'm not speaking to you. You can't make me. Norman watches the doors shut behind them, and his anger
F	COURTNEY	Um, excuse me? Hello? Unmistakably living hands and arms suddenly SMASH through
M	SLOB GUY	They're in there alright! I can feel its clammy flesh! Something CLATTERS behind him, and Norman hears someone
M	NORMAN	Hello? He turns around to face his friend and finds himself He realizes zombies are converging on him from all
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Help! Somebody help me!
M	MRS HENSCHER	Let's burn `em out! Obligingly, a couple of townsfolk hurl Molotov cocktails Tendrils of black smoke are also beginning to creep under The kids stand in a group, terror-stricken as the smoke
F	COURTNEY	We're all gonna DIE! Norman finds himself backed up against a flimsy wooden Above him the red sky RUMBLES, clouds churning into a
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Oh my gosh, do you think this has got anything to do with Norman? Perry waves her hand away irritably.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Of course not! He is interrupted by a SHOUT as someone sees Norman's
M	LIBRARIAN	Everyone look! Perry and Sandra see their son begin gesticulating wildly
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry, do something! He cups his hands around his mouth and YELLS at Norman.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Norman! Get down from there this instant! You're supposed to be grounded! ParaNorman 70.
M	NORMAN	You horrible old witch! Is this what you want? The roiling face above him seems to CACKLE mercilessly.
M	MRS HENSCHER	Necromancer!
M	FEMALE TOURIST	This is all his doing!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Norman! Perry feels the shift in the crowd. They're not just
M	NORMAN	Once upon a time in a far-off land there lived a king and queen... in a magnificent castle... The horrible cloud face above him CACKLES monstrously,
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Why won't you listen to me? Why are you doing this?! The face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of ParaNorman 71. CAMERA follows him as he plummets, SCREAMING, and is There is a loud THUD, and silence. The book in his hand is now a blackened cinder with a A crowd of onlookers gather around a platform at the head
M	JUDGE HOPKINS	Agatha Prenderghast of his Majesty's Province of Massachusetts... As the Judge's voice continues, Norman sees played out
M	JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	...on this day you have been arraigned for the horrible crime of witchcraft... A pale woman fiddles nervously with the ribbon on her
M	JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	...witnessed by those whose testimonies have been heard. A wiry woman with a pinched face gestures fearfully with ParaNorman 72.
M	JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	You have, by this court, been found guilty...
M	NORMAN	No! A young farmhand bows his head shamefully, as he adds
M	JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.)	...and it is passed on you, according to your grievous crimes... Another village woman SOBS into a handkerchief as she QUICK CUTS of the accusers, one after the other, as the
M	JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)	...execution. Camera swings slowly around Norman to reveal AGGIE
F	AGGIE	No! Norman reacts with horror. The "witch" cowering next to
M	JUDGE HOPKINS	Do you have anything to say for yourself?
F	AGGIE	I was only playing!
M	JUDGE HOPKINS	Aye, with fire! You were speaking with the dead! The crowd GASPS and MURMURS fearfully.
M	JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)	I'll not risk damnation on these good people. The town Sheriff grabs Aggie by the shoulder. You are to be taken to the place of execution where you will be hanged by the neck until you be dead... Norman shouts out but no one can hear or see him.
M	NORMAN	Wait! No! You can't do this! The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie. She
F	AGGIE	I didn't do anything wrong! A terrible panic comes over her face.
M	AGGIE (CONT'D)	Stop! Leave me alone or I'll make you sorry! I'll make all of you sorry! Norman feels unsteady on his feet, the room seeming to The world turns black and Norman collapses in a faint.
M	NORMAN	How could you?! She was just a little kid! She was no different than me! The Dead Judge takes a step forward.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Keep away from me! The Dead Judge stops, then opens his horrible mouth and ParaNorman 74.
M	DEAD JUDGE	You... must... stop... the... curse. A beat. Norman is stunned.
M	NORMAN	What? You don't want to kill me? The Judge shakes his head and points down at the book
M	DEAD JUDGE	You can speak to the dead. To us. To her. We need you to read from the book to send us all back to the grave.
M	NORMAN	But it didn't work! It's a fairy tale! Just a bedtime... story... He narrows his eyes at the Judge.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	That's it, isn't it? A bedtime story to keep a little girl asleep for another year. And now you need my help because I'm the only one who can read it to her! He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Here's your book! Try reading it yourself! The zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	Why did you do it?
M	DEAD JUDGE	We were scared.
M	NORMAN	Of what?
M	DEAD JUDGE	Of her. I believed we were doing what was right. I was wrong. Now this is our punishment. ParaNorman 75.
M	DEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)	We thought we knew our way in life but in death we are lost. Norman knows they're telling the truth.
M	DEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)	Please help us. Norman looks at the book of fairy tales, lying at his
M	NORMAN	Every year someone reads the story at her grave. Before me it was Mr Prenderghast, and before him there were others, but the curse doesn't ever go away. Nothing gets better. It's not enough. Norman looks at it a moment, thinking. He knows what he
M	DEAD JUDGE	What will you do?
M	NORMAN	Something nobody ever did before. I've gotta go talk to her.
M	MITCH	Guys! Guys! Under here! Under here! The kids scramble beneath the shelter of the counter as
F	COURTNEY	Mitch, if we die tonight, this might be the last chance I get to tell you how I feel. ParaNorman 76.
M	MITCH	Uh, well, no. Unless we get brought back as zombies, and then technically you'll have longer. Courtney opens her mouth to continue, but her love train The cowering kids all watch in silent horror as several
F	COURTNEY	Norman?
M	NORMAN	Come on! This way!
F	COURTNEY	You've gotta be kidding me... Norman, his mouth shielded by his sleeve, heads The crowd GASPS again as the charred front door of the A ripple of shock runs through the crowd as a number of Hooper pulls out her gun and marches toward the zombies.
M	SHERIFF HOOPER	You stay right where you are! You may be dead already, but I will still shoot you! ParaNorman 77. The zombies stop on the steps, burning building behind
M	NORMAN	Wait! Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Oh my gosh! Far above, the clouds THUNDER like demonic laughter.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Son! Step away from the zombies!
M	NORMAN	No! I won't! Sandra comes up behind her husband and holds his arm.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry, calm down! You're going to have a heart attack and then what are you going to do?
M	PERRY BABCOCK	I'll come back and haunt Norman! Maybe then he'll start listening to me!
M	NORMAN	No! You don't understand what's happening here! I spoke to them and it's not what you think! Courtney edges forward out of the doorway, shocked but
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	The curse isn't about the zombies hurting you! It's about you hurting them! I figured it out, and I know a way to stop this!
M	MRS HENSCHER	He's in league with them! A few members of the crowd try to push past Perry toward
M	DEPUTY DWAYNE	Let's hang him! ParaNorman 78.
M	GUCCI LADY	No! We can't hang him, stupid! It's the 21st Century!
M	DEPUTY DWAYNE	Then let's burn him! Sandra turns despairingly to the crowd behind her.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Can you stop being a mob for just one minute?!
M	NORMAN	Listen to me!
M	CRYSTAL	Get them before they eat us! Punctuating every shout, the roiling clouds continue to
F	COURTNEY	Leave him alone! Courtney suddenly emerges, standing right in front of CLOSE ON Courtney's face as she hisses sidelong to Alvin.
M	COURTNEY (CONT'D)	Hand, Alvin! My hand! A ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd.
M	COURTNEY (CONT'D)	Everybody, listen up! You all need to stop trying to kill my brother! You're adults! Stop it! I know that this seems crazy, believe me I'm with you on that, but I think he does actually know what he's talking about!
M	NEIL	All night he's been trying to save you from the witch's curse!
M	MITCH	Yeah, and all you want to do is burn and murder stuff, burn and murder stuff! Just burning and murdering! ParaNorman 79.
M	ALVIN	Shame on every single one of you! How dare you all! Amongst the crowd, doubt is beginning to show. Even the
M	CRYSTAL	So they're not going to hurt us?
M	NORMAN	No, does it look like any of them are trying to hurt you? They're just people. At least they used to be. Just stupid people who should have known better. Norman looks at the line of Puritans. They look quite sad
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	They did something unforgivable because they were scared, and they were cursed for it. Now it's happening all over again. Don't you get it? They were just like you. But now it has to stop. For good. Across the crowd, weapons are being lowered and faces are There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM. It blows Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a
M	NEIL	Jeez, what is her problem? Norman takes in the chaos around them... ParaNorman 80. -An arc of white lightning hits the base of the witch's -Windows blow out of tacky tourist stores, their cheap
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Oh, Norman!
M	NEIL	So what do we do now?
M	NORMAN	I... I really don't know...
F	COURTNEY	Yes you do, Norman! You've got to get to that witch's grave!
M	NORMAN	But...
F	COURTNEY	But nothing! You listen to me, buster, we didn't turn away when Daleridge High was slaughtering our volleyball team, did we?
M	NORMAN	I thought we did.
F	COURTNEY	No we didn't. I've cheered the uncheerable, Norman, and I'm not letting you give up now! Norman turns to Perry, his eyes all business.
M	NORMAN	Dad, could I borrow the car?
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Excuse me? ParaNorman 81. Norman looks squarely at his dad, and the Dead Judge Perry drives in silent discomfort following the Judge's Perry swerves out of its path of destruction.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Boy, the traffic tonight!
F	COURTNEY	Norman! He's on my side of the seat!
M	NORMAN	She wants you to move over. The Judge MUMBLES.
F	COURTNEY	I heard that! Mom! Tell the zombie to stop saying stuff about me!
M	NORMAN	Can you quit using the "z" word?
M	PERRY BABCOCK	So help me I will stop this car right now if all three of you don't quit it this instant! ParaNorman 82. After a moment, the Judge lets out a sepulchral MOAN.
M	NORMAN	He says "take a left here". Perry gives a distasteful look, but turns the steering
M	PERRY BABCOCK	We've already been this way. We're going around in circles!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Maybe we should pull over and ask someone?
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Oh, right, you think maybe we should stop at a graveyard and dig up some other eighteenth-century corpses?
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	It's not a bad idea.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	I wish I understood you.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Please don't tell me he needs to use the bathroom. Norman listens as the Judge continues GRUMBLING, then
M	NORMAN	Turn down there!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Oh my, do you think that's it? ParaNorman 83. Norman turns to the Dead Judge. The Judge nods solemnly, Norman steels himself and begins to march forward through
M	PERRY BABCOCK	So, why are we here?
M	NORMAN	Someone's gotta talk to her, Dad.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Yeah, um, why's that person you, exactly? As they continue, the surrounding trees press in on them,
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Oh my goodness, look out!
M	NORMAN	Mom!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Perry! Do something! Perry is finding it difficult to move; a tree bears down
M	PERRY BABCOCK	I'm trying!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Kick it in the knothole! Norman hops nimbly between two huge trunks as they SMASH
M	SANDRA BABCOCK (CONT'D)	Norman?! ParaNorman 84. I'm okay Mom! Wait for me here! Don't worry!
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Be careful! Now separated from the others, Norman turns to go ahead In the center of it all is the tree, bleached white as Beneath this tree lie Aggie's remains, buried three
M	NORMAN	Hello? Words echo around him in response.
F	AGGIE	You're not welcome here. Go away. Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly.
M	NORMAN	Uh... I really need to speak with you.
F	AGGIE	Who are you?
M	NORMAN	I'm Norman. Norman Babcock. You don't actually know me, but I know you. We're actually kind of the same, you and I. Norman takes another step closer, ducking as petrified
F	AGGIE	You're not dead.
M	NORMAN	Well, no, apart from that.
F	AGGIE	And you're a boy.
M	NORMAN	Well, yes, that too.
F	AGGIE	You're not like me at all. Norman hesitates, knowing he's on dangerous ground.
M	NORMAN	Well, I know how you feel?
F	AGGIE	No you don't. You don't know anything about me.
M	NORMAN	I know your name is Agatha Prenderghast. The ghostly voice wavers for the first time.
F	AGGIE	What?
M	NORMAN	And I know you're probably tired. Right? Because, I mean, it's really late and it's been a long night and we're, like, only eleven years-old, and... The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder.
F	AGGIE	I don't want to go to sleep, and you can't make me! I burnt the book into dust, and now I don't have to listen to that stupid story any more! Leave me alone! Norman is terrified, but advances on the tree, the rocks
M	NORMAN	No. I'm not leaving. Just listen to me. Uh... once upon a time... long ago... there was a little girl... ParaNorman 86.
F	AGGIE	What?
M	NORMAN	A little girl who was different from the other people in her village. The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its
F	AGGIE	I'm not listening! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-
M	NORMAN	She could see and do things that no one could understand, and that made them scared of her.
F	AGGIE	I don't like this story!
M	NORMAN	She turned away from everyone, and became sad and lonely, and had no one to turn to.
F	AGGIE	Stop it! If Aggie weren't floating three feet above the ground,
M	NORMAN	But the more she turned away from people, the more scared they were of her, and they did something terrible! Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air. Where they
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	They became so scared that they took her away and killed her!
F	AGGIE	No!
M	NORMAN	But even though she was dead something in her came back.
F	AGGIE	Stop! ParaNorman 87.
M	NORMAN	And this part of her wouldn't go away, not for three hundred years...
F	AGGIE	Shut up!
M	NORMAN	And the longer it stayed, the less there was of the little girl!
F	AGGIE	I'll make you suffer!
M	NORMAN	Why? Aggie goes to shout, but stops, unsure of her answer.
F	AGGIE	Because... because...
M	NORMAN	Because you want everyone to hurt just as much as you are! So whenever you wake up you play this mean game, but you don't play fair!
F	AGGIE	They hurt me!
M	NORMAN	So you hurt them back?
F	AGGIE	I wanted everyone to see how rotten they were!
M	NORMAN	You're just like them, Agatha.
F	AGGIE	No I'm not!
M	NORMAN	You're a bully.
F	AGGIE	No I'm not! Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm. The world
M	NORMAN	They did something awful, but that doesn't mean you should too! ParaNorman 88.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	All that's left of you now is mean and horrible! He sees her clearly now. True, she is floating above the
F	AGGIE	That's not true! Norman climbs up a tree root, Aggie's flames searing his
M	NORMAN	Then stop. This is wrong and you know it! You've spent so long remembering the bad people that you've forgotten the good ones. There must have been someone who loved you and cared for you. You don't remember them?
F	AGGIE	Leave me alone!
M	NORMAN	But you're not alone! You have to remember!
F	AGGIE	Keep away from me! Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps. His
M	NORMAN	Remember! There is a flash of white, and silence. Aggie is no longer an indistinct specter, but flesh and
F	AGGIE	Aggie. My name was Aggie. ParaNorman 89. A brightly-colored butterfly flutters between them. Aggie
M	AGGIE (CONT'D)	I... I remember my mommy brought me here once. We sat under the tree and she told me stories. They all had happy endings. And then those horrible men came and took me away and I never saw her again! She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her
M	NORMAN	Sometimes when people get scared they say and do terrible things. I think you got so scared, that you forgot who you are. But I don't think you're a witch. Not really. Aggie looks into his eyes.
F	AGGIE	You don't?
M	NORMAN	I think you're just a little kid with a really special gift who only ever wanted people to understand her. He smiles softly.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	So we're not all that different at all.
F	AGGIE	But what about the people who hurt you? Don't you ever want to make them suffer? Norman thinks this over, and shrugs.
M	NORMAN	Well, yeah, but what good would that do? You think just because there's bad people out there that there's no good ones either? I thought the same thing. ParaNorman 90.
M	NORMAN (CONT'D)	For a while. But there's always someone out there for you. Somewhere. Aggie frowns, looking lost.
F	AGGIE	I just want my mommy...
M	NORMAN	I'm sorry, Aggie. She's gone.
F	AGGIE	That story you were telling. How does it end?
M	NORMAN	I think that's up to you. Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet.
F	AGGIE	Is this where they buried me?
M	NORMAN	It's a pretty good place to sleep. Then you can be with your mom again. Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground,
M	143 CONTINUED: 143	For a moment they float where they stood, ghostly apparitions of the people they once were before the He sits upon the upturned root of the tree, the earth
M	NORMAN	Sleep tight. He clambers down through the roots back toward the path.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	Norman? Norman! Sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms,
M	SANDRA BABCOCK (CONT'D)	My brave little man! I thought I was going to lose you!
M	NORMAN	Mom, you're embarrassing me.
M	SANDRA BABCOCK	That's my job.
F	COURTNEY	Good job, Norman. Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son. There is
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Well done, Son. You did it. The Judge, stood some way behind them, lets out a GROAN, ParaNorman 92. They watch in awe as the Judge begins to turn to dust, In the Town Square, clusters of townsfolk are trying to Dwayne waves his notebook under Hooper's nose.
M	DEPUTY DWAYNE	So, uh, are we gonna need statements? She slaps it out of his hand.
M	DEPUTY DWAYNE (CONT'D)	Ow! That was my finger nail. Slob Guy, Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each
M	MRS HENSCHER	You know what it's like. You join a mob and you say things. I was merely inhabiting the role.
M	SLOB GUY	Yeah, it was the others. They pushed me into it. Norman smiles as he passes Alvin, regaling a bunch of
M	ALVIN	Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot of the same classes. Pretty much inseparable. Best buds. And we do a lot of psychic investigations together. We have a blog actually, you should check it out. Nearby, Courtney wastes no time cozying up to Mitch.
F	COURTNEY	So I was thinking, maybe we could catch a movie sometime? Nothing scary.
M	MITCH	That sounds great, Kathy! Y'know, you're gonna love my boyfriend! He's like a total chick-flick nut! Courtney stares at him, at a loss for words, then Norman eventually finds Neil sat upon the witch statue's
M	NORMAN	Hey Neil. He climbs up beside his friend, who beams at him
M	NEIL	You did it! You stopped the witch's curse and made the zombies go away and saved pretty much everything!
M	NORMAN	I guess. I just wanted to say thanks. You stood by me. All the time.
M	NEIL	Yeah, of course. Don't get weird or anything. So you think now everything's gonna turn back to normal? Norman looks across the square. The smoldering buildings,
M	NORMAN	As normal as it could be.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Son.
M	NORMAN	Hi Dad.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	What're you watching?
M	NORMAN	A scary movie.
M	PERRY BABCOCK	Your, uh, your grandma here is she? Norman looks around and sees his father and grandmother
M	PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)	Right. Of course she is. Perry tries his best to maintain his composure, and
M	PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)	Is she... Is she sitting next to me? Norman nods. Perry "hem-hems" and turns awkwardly to face
M	PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)	Hi Mom. Perry tries to downplay his discomfort and turns back to
M	PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D) GRANDMA BABCOCK
