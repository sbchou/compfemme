M	DOCTOR	Where's the crash cart!?
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Love sure is a funny thing... It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes you do all sorts of things you never thought you'd do before. Love's the reason I'm here actually. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 2.
M	RED HAIRED BOY	I still don't see it.
M	LITTLE GIRL	It's right there.
M	YOUNG STEVEN	It's really big. Steeeeeeeeeven...
M	STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)	Steeeeeeeeeven...
M	STEVEN'S MOM	Are you a happy little boy Steven?
M	STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)	You've always been such a happy little boy. Now Steven, we want to tell you something very important, but I want you to understand that it doesn't change a thing.
M	STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)	We're still gonna love you, you're still gonna be our happy little boy and you're still gonna--
M	STEVEN'S BROTHER	You're adopted. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 3.
M	YOUNG STEVEN	Shut up!
M	STEVEN'S MOM	It's true. Your brother overheard your Dad and I talking and well, we didn't want you to hear it from anybody but us. It's true. You're a special little boy. You know why? Because we chose you. Not like your brother here who's natural.
M	STEVEN'S DAD	Your Mother's right. It's cause we love you. So we put some money in a brown paper bag and gave it to your real mom in the hospital parking lot so you could come home with us. Okay?
M	STEVEN'S MOM	It doesn't change a thing honey. We love you just as much as we love your brother here... ...and he's natural.
M	STEVEN'S DAD	So son, are you okay?
M	YOUNG STEVEN	Yes Daddy.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn't gonna let it get me down. No way. I was gonna be the best son- No, the best person I could be. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 4.
F	MANDI	Virginia Beach Police Department, how may I direct your call?
M	MANDI (CONT'D)	Something came for you.
F	STEVEN	Hey fellas.
M	VARIOUS POLICEMAN	Hey Steve, Steve, mornin', etc...
F	STEVEN	Have lots of dreams...
F	STEPHANIE	Okay.
F	DEBBIE	...and if it wasn't for you Jesus, I would have never found that last coffee filter and Prayer-Girls would have been ruined. So thank you for that.
F	STEVEN	Amen.
F	DEBBIE	And thank you for Steffie's allergy screen coming back all negative. I always knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy nuts. And finally I want to thank you for this man Jesus. This man who works so hard to make us happy without even a thought for himself. This man who pursued me to the ends of the Earth and promised me a life of eternal happiness. A promise he has kept oh Lord. Every day. Amen.
F	STEVEN	Amen. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 6.
F	DEBBIE	Sometimes when I think of how happy I am, I just want to cry. Like the time when you--
F	STEVEN	Okay let's wrap it up...
F	DEBBIE	And in your gracious name, I find thee and praise thee. Amen.
F	STEVEN	Amen.
F	STEVEN	I'm absolutely bushed.
F	DEBBIE	Me too.
F	STEVEN	Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots of access? You know- records and things?
F	DEBBIE	Steven-
F	STEVEN	Now do you think it's, you know, unethical, to use that to find my mother? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 7.
F	DEBBIE	Oh... that. Yeah, um, well I don't know-
F	STEVEN	I swear honey- getting around the system's so easy. No one would even know I did it.
F	DEBBIE	I know you want to find her Steven, but you need to think about this.
F	STEVEN	You're right, I shouldn't have done it.
F	DEBBIE	You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what'd you find?
F	STEVEN	I haven't looked. It's downstairs.
F	DEBBIE	Really? Well let's go!
F	STEVEN	Well hold on- let me finish.
F	DEBBIE	Oh, right.
F	STEVEN	There- that's got it.
F	DEBBIE	What?
F	STEVEN	She's right here. She's been right here all this time. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 8.
F	DEBBIE	It's really her?
F	STEVEN	Yeah. No question.
F	DEBBIE	My goodness Steven, that's wonderful. What? What is it? Steven?
M	MRS. BASCOMBE	Is something wrong officer?
F	STEVEN	Are you Barbra Bascombe?
M	MRS. BASCOMBE	Yes. Is something wrong? Is someone hurt?
F	STEVEN	In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave up a baby for adoption, correct?
M	MRS. BASCOMBE	I don't think I know what you're talking about.
F	STEVEN	Elizabeth City? St Jude's Hospital? Remember?
M	MRS. BASCOMBE	I don't know what you're talking about.
F	STEVEN	You were young. I know that you made a mistake giving me away, but-
M	MRS. BASCOMBE	Listen-
F	STEVEN	Shhhhhh. Mommy please- let me finish.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	We all make mistakes. What I came here to say is, I forgive you because none of us is perfect but now with a fresh start we can build --
M	MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)	I have no idea what you're talking about, Steven.
F	STEVEN	No, it's okay, I know everything. But it's fine. Just tell me why--
M	MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)	Go away!
F	STEVEN	Okay, okay. I understand. It's a lot at once. But I can come back. How's that? I can come back later, I'll bring us some coffee and we can talk about... WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER TWO CHILDREN! I WAS THE MIDDLE CHILD! WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?! WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME!? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 10.
M	STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I quit the force that day. I packed up the family and moved to Texas. I got a great job and got to living the American Dream.
F	STEPHANIE	I can't find my blue fish. Steven?
F	STEVEN	In the laundry room.
F	DEBBIE	Steven you haven't met our new neighbors down two and across the street- Neil and Sara.
F	STEVEN	No I haven't. I hope you're planning on changing the paint. What do you call that color?
M	NEIL	Oh we're changing it.
F	STEVEN	Good, good, good... good.
M	NEIL	So Debbie tells me you used to be in the police force back in Georgia.
F	STEVEN	Virginia Beach.
M	NEIL	Right. Sorry...
F	SARA	Neil...
F	STEVEN	Yeah, kinda lost interest. Got back into the family business.
M	NEIL	Which is?
F	STEVEN	Produce. I work for Sysco.
M	NEIL	That's a big outfit. They give you that Corvette out there?
F	STEVEN	Yes sir-ee.
F	DEBBIE	Great benefits, too.
F	STEVEN	And the hours don't crush me either. I get plenty of home time.
F	DEBBIE	It's good to have him where I can keep an eye on him.
F	STEVEN	Among other things...
F	SARA	Ooooooh! Watch out! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 12.
F	STEVEN	I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come...
M	MOUSTACHED MAN	DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! Oh did I forget to mention I was gay? Yeah, sorry about that. I'm gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as I can remember...
M	LITTLE GIRL	I see a pony! What do you see!? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 13.
M	LITTLE BOY	I see a diesel train!
M	RED HAIRED BOY	I see a whirlybird!
M	YOUNG STEVEN	I see a wiener.
M	RED HAIRED BOY	What?! What kind of wiener?
M	YOUNG STEVEN	A man's wiener.
M	LITTLE BOY	Shut up! There's no wiener!
M	YOUNG STEVEN	Uh huh!
M	RED HAIRED BOY	No there's not!
M	LITTLE GIRL	Oh I see it. There it is!
M	YOUNG STEVEN	Told ya... Anyway where was I? Oh yeah--
M	MOUSTACHED MAN	DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 14.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	And I did.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	I had been living a lie for a long, long time. I tend to do that... hide things.
M	MOUSTACHED MAN	You be careful out there, you're a little drunk.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Now just because I was screwing around doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did. I loved her with all my heart... Stephanie too. My family was all I had and they needed me. So I told myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it stayed that way. That's what I told myself. But life has a way of forcing these things into the light. You might even call it an epiphany. corvette are all around. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 15.
F	STEVEN	I haven't lived my life.
M	PARAMEDIC	Try not to talk sir.
F	STEVEN	Fuck you... No one is going to tell me what to do anymore. No more lies. I'm going to live my life. My way. Be the real me. Time for some good living. Buy what I want, do what I want, fuck who I want. My way.
M	PARAMEDIC	Okay sir whatever you say.
F	STEVEN	I'm gonna be a fag.
M	PARAMEDIC	Okay.
F	STEVEN	A big fag...
M	PARAMEDIC	Alright. Let's move. Yep, just like that I decided to start my life over and live it like the real me. No more lies. I was born again.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	It would be hard to break it to Debbie, but I knew I'd find a way... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 16.
F	STEVEN	Honey, I'm gay!
M	STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	To my surprise, we stayed friends. And I was finally free.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Life was good. Everything was falling right into place. I moved to Florida, got a new job, had two adorable pups, I was dating a cute guy named Jimmy. I could do anything I wanted... But it didn't take me long to realize something that never occurred to me before. Actually no one ever talks about this but...
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	...being gay is really expensive. It is.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	I mean it's not just sucking cock. It's wardrobe, it's hair, personal trainers, big labels, resorts, fine dining... it goes on and on and on. So I needed money. And for a guy without a college education, my options were limited.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	So I had no choice-- I became a con man!
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Of course that was easy for me, every closet case is a con anyways.
F	LAWYER	Your check. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 18.
F	STEVEN	Thank you.
M	STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Now it didn't happen all at once. It was sort of a gradual thing... It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain stores as higher grade.
M	PRODUCE MANAGER	These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right?
F	STEVEN	Finest in the land... It's called `field buying'. I could clear three thousand dollars in a good week doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough.
M	SALESWOMAN	Cash or charge?
F	STEVEN	Charge...
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell, Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell... Ah!
M	SALESWOMAN	Thank you... ...Mister Evans. Can I see some ID?
F	STEVEN	Of course.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	But when money got really tight, the slip and fall always came in handy.
M	KEMPLE	Oh wow...
F	STEVEN	What do you think? Yes? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 20.
M	KEMPLE	Well Steven it's beautiful. It really is.
F	STEVEN	You don't like it.
M	KEMPLE	No, no, no. I do.
F	STEVEN	You don't like it.
M	KEMPLE	I'm menstruating. Don't listen to me.
F	STEVEN	Tell me what's wrong with it. Is it the gold?
M	KEMPLE	Well...
F	STEVEN	That's why I got you the stainless!
M	KEMPLE	Steven!
F	STEVEN	The gold one is for me, dipshit.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Merry Christmas!
F	DEBBIE	Merry Christmas.
F	STEVEN	Hi Debbie! Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 21.
F	DEBBIE	How's Jimmy?
F	STEVEN	Good. Did you get the gifts?
F	DEBBIE	Well that's why I'm calling...
F	STEVEN	You're welcome!
F	DEBBIE	I can't keep this.
F	STEVEN	Why not?
F	DEBBIE	Well... it's not Christian.
F	STEVEN	Not Christian? Why's that?
F	DEBBIE	This is not what the Lord wants.
F	STEVEN	So you're saying you know what the Lord wants?
F	DEBBIE	No. I would never say that. Why? Do you think this is what he wants?
F	STEVEN	It's the leap of faith Deb. It's the not knowing that's the answer.
F	DEBBIE	Well I never thought about it that way...
M	STEPHANIE (O.S.)	Mommy look!
F	DEBBIE	Steven! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 22.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Of course, Jimmy and Debbie had no idea what I was up to. For the time being, at least...
F	STEVEN	Morning Sandy!
M	CHERUBIC SECRETARY	Morning Steven. You have visitors.
F	STEVEN	Okey-dokey! Federal Marshalls... They wanted me for all sorts of stuff- Insurance fraud, identity theft, passport fraud. They were probably gonna extradite me all the way back to Texas. I had to decide what to do next. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 23.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	But one thing was for sure-- I was not gonna let them put me away. I was a cop and I knew what jail was like. And there was no way I was going there. I had a plan.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine. Hey...
F	STEVEN	Sorry.
M	KEMPLE	Why didn't you tell me?
F	STEVEN	I can't go to prison, Jimmy. I can't. I can't go to prison. I can't. I can't...
M	KEMPLE	Okay-okay calm down. It's okay. I just want to tell them you're awake and we can take it from there.
F	DEBBIE	Did you know Steven was wanted?
M	KEMPLE	Not until just now.
F	DEBBIE	He likes to keep little secrets sometimes.
M	KEMPLE	Like the fact that he was a big queer?
F	DEBBIE	Yeah, like that.
M	KEMPLE	But suicide, my god.
F	DEBBIE	Well he does tend to overreact.
M	KEMPLE	I feel like I don't even know him. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 25.
F	DEBBIE	Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not really sure he knows who he is. He's searching, at least that's how I figure it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for.
M	KEMPLE	Can you tell me exactly what he did?
M	COP	He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud, forgery, embezzlement...
F	DEBBIE	What?
M	KEMPLE	I should have known... I should have said something.
F	DEBBIE	Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.
M	KEMPLE	That would be a warning sign...
F	DEBBIE	And all that Peter Allen music on his Walkman.
M	KEMPLE	Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now.
F	DEBBIE	I just never thought. But now stealing?
M	KEMPLE	He's probably been doing it for years. I say to myself he did it just to buy me things but I don't think that's true. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 26.
F	DEBBIE	It's bigger than that. I'm sure.
M	KEMPLE	But why then?
F	DEBBIE	And why suicide? I mean- just like that?
M	KEMPLE	I know- he seemed so happy and--
F	DEBBIE	
M	KEMPLE	Steven!!! Stop!
M	KEMPLE (CONT'D)	Steven!
M	KEMPLE (CONT'D)	Wait Steven. Don't!
M	KEMPLE (CONT'D)	Steven I'm serious! You stop or you'll never see me again! I mean it! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 27.
M	KEMPLE (CONT'D)	STEVEN!
M	INMATES	
F	STEVEN	Hi. Welcome to prison. I'm Steven.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Oh don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. First time?
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Shit, I was so scared when I first got here. But you get used to it. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 28.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Only took me a year. You just need to know a few ins and outs and you'll be fine.
F	STEVEN	You're gonna catch a beating any day now, that's just the way it is. I lost three teeth and cracked a vertebrae. Anyway, all you need to do is fight back. Win or lose, just fight back. Or you could try to suck the guys' dick. Your choice.
F	STEVEN	Law Library. I pretty much live here. I don't really have anyone on the outside except my ex-wife- so I just hunker down here learning everything there is to know about the law. Ask me anything.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	See him. Over there? Him? Anything you want from outside, he's the guy. Candy, cigarettes, drugs, whatever. He's the guy. Just keep in mind- it's gonna cost you a lot of money. Or you could suck his dick. Your choice.
F	STEVEN	Three meals a day. Not so bad. Just make sure if you make enemies with someone, he doesn't work here. Otherwise you'll wake up one morning shitting blood and find out you've been eating ground glass in your cornbread for six weeks.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His name's Gary.
M	GARY	...letters, magazines, shit like that- it all goes through unmolested. But if Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or brownies or whatever-- you're gonna have to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five bucks per item or you can suck my dick.
F	STEVEN	Your choice.
F	STEVEN	Well that's about it. You're gonna be fine. Don't worry. And if you need anything you just let me know. Alright?
M	ARNIE	So, uh, do I need to suck your dick? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 30.
F	STEVEN	That'd be great.
M	DEBBIE (O.S.)	Hi this is Debbie and Steffie. Sorry we missed you. Leave a message. God Bless!
F	STEVEN	Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. I thought one o'clock was our time but maybe not. I sure miss you guys. Thanks for the picture and the article. Sometimes it's just nice to know there's someone out there who still cares about me since Jimmy left and all. So... uh...
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Do you think I broke his heart? Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the machine... I'll try you again next time. One O'clock. Don't forget. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 31.
M	PHILLIP	Thanks. Guess I need a few extra inches.
F	STEVEN	Glad to help. How's the bird?
M	PHILLIP	Huh? Oh. Him, yeah... he's at peace.
F	STEVEN	Oh, I'm sorry.
M	PHILLIP	It was for the best. He was suffering.
F	STEVEN	Civil law? You know, I'm an attorney.
M	PHILLIP	Really?
F	STEVEN	You suing someone?
M	PHILLIP	I don't know what I'm doing. There's a guy I know- he's in the infirmary now. He's sick- he's real sick... AIDS. I thought maybe I could find a way to get him some help- I mean real help. Not here. I don't know- maybe I could-- I don't even know what I'm looking for...
F	STEVEN	Does he have a lawyer? Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 32.
M	PHILLIP	Yeah.
F	STEVEN	Have him get in touch with the Prisoner Rights Committee. They deal with this all the time- pro bono. I've got the number.
M	PHILLIP	Well thank you, I--
F	STEVEN	My name's Steven Russell.
M	PHILLIP	Pleased to meet you Steven Russell, my name's Phillip Morris.
F	STEVEN	I haven't seen you around Phillip. I'm always in the yard...
M	PHILLIP	I don't go to the yard. You know what happens to blonde haired, blue eyed queers in the yard...
F	STEVEN	It is kind of rough out there. You don't look like you belong here Phillip.
M	PHILLIP	I don't.
F	STEVEN	Why are you here?
M	PHILLIP	I rented a car... and kept it too long.
F	STEVEN	Grand theft?
M	PHILLIP	Theft of service.
F	STEVEN	Insurance fraud.
M	PHILLIP	No. Just theft of service. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 33.
F	STEVEN	No. Me. Insurance fraud.
M	PHILLIP	Damn, we're both in a mess aren't we?
F	STEVEN	Don't seem fair, does it?
M	PHILLIP	No, it don't.
F	STEVEN	You know, I keep finding that life's a little shittier than I thought it was gonna be.
M	PHILLIP	Oh, listen to you, Gloomy Gus. I think you're gonna be just fine, Steven Russell.
F	STEVEN	I guess I'm inclined to believe you.
M	PHILLIP	Why's that?
F	STEVEN	I met you today, didn't I?
F	STEVEN	...I made the mistake of writing her and saying I was lonely in here. And next thing you know, my ex-wife catches her putting the neighbor's puppy in a box to mail to me.
M	PHILLIP	Ohhhhh, she sounds so sweet... Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 34.
F	STEVEN	Oh she's an angel. I think I'll be sure to write her back and tell her I'm not lonely anymore... that I made a good friend.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	What?
M	PHILLIP	Why'd I have to meet you today?
F	STEVEN	Something wrong?
M	PHILLIP	It's just- I'm being transferred to Michael Unit today.
F	STEVEN	What?
M	PHILLIP	I'm sorry.
F	STEVEN	Don't be sorry. It's just across the yard.
M	PHILLIP	Well I don't go into that yard so it might as well be Oklahoma. Just figures with my luck. I was born Friday the 13th...
F	STEVEN	It's not gonna change a thing, Phillip. In fact, Friday the 13th's my lucky day. Don't worry, this right here. This is destiny.
M	PHILLIP	But we only just met.
F	STEVEN	Listen, I've loved a lot. And I've been around, so I recognize the feeling. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 35.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	That one you and me are having right now- the one you're trying to forget exists because you're going away. But there's about 6000 volts shooting across this table here and you know you can't deny it.
M	PHILLIP	Don't you think you're coming on a little strong?
F	STEVEN	I know you're trying to protect yourself, I get that. It's fine. Give me a chance to prove you wrong.
M	PHILLIP	I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
F	STEVEN	Good...
M	CLEAVON (O.S.)	You Phillip?
M	PHILLIP	Yes.
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	Already? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 36. Phillip, hope your new place is nice. Nice enough anyway. I hope the chocolate made it to you okay. Check the T.P.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	I hope you try to make some new friends and not be too shy. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself...
M	PHILLIP (V.O.)	Dear Steven. I keep thinking about you saying I'm shy. I guess you're right, but I don't feel shy around you. I think that means something...
M	PHILLIP (V.O.)	Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I should tell you I'm diabetic so I probably shouldn't... but I did anyway. It's been so long since anyone's shown me any kindness and well, it means a lot. I just wish you were here...
M	PHILLIP (V.O.)	...Write me back soon. Phillip. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 37.
M	PHILLIP	Hurry up would you?
M	CLEAVON	I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot. Besides I ain't got nothing for you anyway...
M	PHILLIP	But it's been three days.
M	CLEAVON	You got a tracking number, motherfucker?
M	PHILLIP	No.
M	CLEAVON	Then shut your faggot ass.
M	PHILLIP	Congratulations Phillip, scared off another one.
M	CORRECTIONS OFFICER	Morris - you got a new roommate. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 38.
M	PHILLIP	Oh my God. How the hell did you do this?
F	STEVEN	I know a guy. I took care of it. I'm gonna take care of everything...
M	PHILLIP	Enough romance, let's fuck.
M	PHILLIP	And for a while I was Executive Assistant to a Broadway Producer...
F	STEVEN	Really? What's a Broadway producer doing in Atlanta?
M	PHILLIP	I didn't ask.
F	STEVEN	What'd you do for him?
M	PHILLIP	I mainly just rode around town in his limo, drinking and sucking him off.
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	Now that I hear myself say it, I think he was just some rich chicken hawk.
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	Oh well, he was a nice guy. I only dated him for a little while anyway. Then I dated this full-blooded Apache who made me dress up like a baseball player.
F	STEVEN	Apache? What was his name?
M	PHILLIP	Melvin.
F	STEVEN	Phillip- you amaze me.
M	PHILLIP	What? He was a nice guy too.
F	STEVEN	That's what I'm saying- you only see the good.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	What the hell was that?
M	PHILLIP	That's the Screecher next door. He does it all night. I never get any sleep. He drives me crazy.
F	STEVEN	You poor thing. How awful... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 40.
M	LARGE PRISONER	I'm gonna cut out your motherfucking tongue with your screeching all night.
M	PHILLIP	What does he care- he ain't in our block...
M	BALD PRISONER	Someone probably paid him.
M	PHILLIP	Get up...
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	Did you pay to have the Screecher beat up?
F	STEVEN	Me?
M	PHILLIP	Don't bullshit me. Did you pay to have him beat up? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 41.
F	STEVEN	Well you said he bothered you.
M	PHILLIP	Just answer me.
F	STEVEN	Yeah. Yeah, I did.
M	PHILLIP	Steven...
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	This is the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me.
F	STEVEN	I just want you to be happy, baby.
M	PHILLIP	You are so amazing!!! Cleavon- put this in.
M	CLEAVON	No man- not now. It's important.
M	CLEAVON	How important?
M	CLEAVON (CONT'D)	Ten. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 42.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Fine. But you gotta play the whole thing.
M	CLEAVON	Yeah, alright. Promise?
M	CLEAVON	Fuck you- my word's my bond motherfucker.
M	CLEAVON (CONT'D)	Fuck man- Johnny Mathis? Fucking white- ass nigger...
M	PHILLIP	C'mon...
F	STEVEN	What?
M	PHILLIP	C'mon. Dance.
F	STEVEN	No. No... I can't dance.
M	PHILLIP	Yes you can.
F	STEVEN	No I can't. I'm serious...
M	PHILLIP	Honey, you're queer- it comes with the package.
F	STEVEN	Well not me. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 43.
M	PHILLIP	C'mon, I'll show you...
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	Hold me here... and here. Okay watch...
M	LATINO MAN	Yeah you fucking bitch...
M	GUARD (O.S.)	LIGHTS OUT! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 44.
M	GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)	LIGHTS OUT!
M	GUARD (CONT'D)	I said lights out. Turn it off. Fuck you pig.
M	GUARD (O.S.)	Turn it off or we're coming in. Well come on in. I got a dick that needs sucking. ON THE GROUND! FUCK YOU! MY WORD IS MY FUCKING BOND! MY WORD IS MY FUCKING BOND!
M	GUARD (O.S.)	Rise and shine!
M	GUARD (CONT'D)	Russell! Get up!
M	GUARD (CONT'D)	Grab your shit! Let's go!
M	PHILLIP	What's happening?
M	GUARD	You're transferred. Nonney snitched you out about the Screecher. You're going to Ramsey Two.
F	STEVEN	Ah shit...
M	PHILLIP	Wait!
F	STEVEN	Don't you touch him!
M	PHILLIP	Steven-
F	STEVEN	Don't worry Phillip- I'll-
M	GUARD	Shut up and move.
M	PHILLIP	Steven!
M	PHILLIP	STEVEN!! STEVEN!
M	PHILLIP	I wanna go in the yard.
M	YARD GUARD	You do?
M	PHILLIP	I WANNA GO IN THE YARD!
M	YARD GUARD	Hold your horses Dorothy. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 47.
M	PHILLIP	STEVEN!!!!
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	STEVEN! What the hell are you doing!?
M	PHILLIP	I love you!
F	STEVEN	I love you too!
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	We'll be together soon! I promise!
M	PHILLIP	GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY!!!
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Those were the longest three months of my life. I wrote to Phillip every day until I got released.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	And once I did, I was determined to get us back together as soon as possible.
F	STEVEN	Hi, how are you?
M	TAXI DRIVER	I'm well. Where you headed? The Greyhound?
F	STEVEN	Nearest thrift store please.
M	TAXI DRIVER	Sure. You mind if I tell you the word of our Lord, Jesus Christ? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 49.
F	STEVEN	Hi there, my name's Steven Rousseau. I'm an attorney. My client is Phillip Morris. I called earlier.
M	DUTY OFFICER	Mmm hmmm. There you are. Rousseau... Phillip Morris. Like the cigarette huh?
F	STEVEN	I beg your pardon?
M	PHILLIP	You said you'd come right away, but Jesus!
F	STEVEN	I got work to do honey, I'm getting you out of here early. I got a hearing tomorrow morning, I got motions to file. The law don't sleep baby.
M	PHILLIP	I love you so much.
F	STEVEN	Phillip, you are the sweetest, most gentle man I have ever met. And I know people have taken advantage of that. But I don't ever want you ever to lose that innocence. I want to build a life with you Phillip. I want to protect you.
M	PHILLIP	Get me out of here. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 50.
F	STEVEN	The motion was filed, I presented to the DA and got a letter from the judge- I do not understand what the hold up is. I'm not some paralegal- I am Steven fucking Rousseau and I expect proper adjudication!
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	My boyfriend's getting out of prison next week!
M	HOUSEWIFE	How nice...
F	STEVEN	You want mayo with that?
F	STEVEN	I have an early release order for Phillip Morris.
M	RELEASE OFFICER	Yep- Morris- we got him right here waiting.
M	RELEASE OFFICER (CONT'D)	And you are--?
F	STEVEN	I'm his lawyer. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 51.
M	PHILLIP	You're incredible.
F	STEVEN	I know.
M	BAYLOR	Phillllip! It's so good to see you...
M	BLAKE	Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed with you. How do I get on that diet?
M	PHILLIP	Oh you couldn't handle it- not unless we smuggled an espresso machine in a cake.
M	BLAKE	Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I'm there!
M	PHILLIP	This is Steven. Steven- Blake and Baylor.
M	BLAKE	lawyer prison boyfriend?! Pleased to meet you.
M	BAYLOR	Much better than the guy who had you kidnapped. What was his name?
M	PHILLIP	Long story.
F	STEVEN	Can I get you all a drink? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 52.
F	STEVEN	We gotta get a bigger place.
M	PHILLIP	Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor- Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest.
F	EUDORA	Pleasure Steven.
F	STEVEN	Eudora...
M	PHILLIP	Eudora owns a little building in Montrose and she's having a hell of time with the builder. He sounds like a real asshole.
F	EUDORA	His plans were useless and he's trying to sue me to pay him! I need your expertise Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help.
F	STEVEN	I could certainly try.
F	EUDORA	Can you still practice law, having been to prison?
F	STEVEN	Sure- why not?
F	EUDORA	I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd just be glad to have someone I could trust. I'll pay your normal fee.
F	STEVEN	It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my speciality.
F	STEVEN	Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in court all day. Let's go in.
M	JUDGE (O.S.)	Mister Russell?
F	STEVEN	It's a beautiful fixture.
M	JUDGE	I know. It's your turn.
F	STEVEN	Oh... Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed.
F	LAWYER	The terms of that contract were ambiguous at best. The truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment.
F	STEVEN	Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his!
F	LAWYER	Is this true?
M	EVANS	No.
F	LAWYER	You're making me look like an idiot.
M	LAWYER (CONT'D)	Your honor, I don't have to tell you that none of this is admissable or applicable to the case at hand. Mr. Russell's histrionics do not erase the fact that his client is in breech of contract. He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have to say?
F	STEVEN	I demand to be seen in chambers!!
M	JUDGE	Okaaaaaaaay...
M	JUDGE	Okay gentlemen, let's get this over with, the two for one at the Crab Boiler ends at five o'clock. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 55.
F	LAWYER	This seems to be cut and dried here, sir. I don't even know why we're back here. Mister Russell is treating this like an episode of Matlock.
F	STEVEN	I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't go to Yale. My education was modest. I went to a small school. I grew up on a small farm. But I passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let him push around this humble woman.
M	JUDGE	Point taken Mister Russell...
M	JUDGE (CONT'D)	...but where are you going with this?
F	STEVEN	I think it's obvious where I'm going with this sir.
M	JUDGE	Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?
F	LAWYER	Shit...
F	STEVEN	Your honor, that's exactly what I'm talking about. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 56.
F	STEVEN	YES! I did great! Can you believe how great I did!?
F	EUDORA	Yes. You did very well, Steven. Thank you.
F	STEVEN	I mean, I did great! Really great! I'm so proud of myself! You want half my sandwich?!
F	EUDORA	Um...
F	STEVEN	No! We're going out! I'm paying!!
M	PHILLIP	Oh my God, it's amazing.
F	STEVEN	I thought you'd like it honey.
M	PHILLIP	Can we afford this?
F	STEVEN	You let me worry about the money sweetheart.
M	PHILLIP	Okay, well I guess I better start packing boxes.
F	STEVEN	Not this weekend.
M	PHILLIP	Why not? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 57.
F	STEVEN	I think we both need a vacation. Key West?
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	I've been meaning to ask you something.
M	STEVEN (O.S.)	Yeah? That birthday cake you got me in the pen? Where'd you get those candles? Oh you know... just... people I knew.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Yeah, I know. But how? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 58.
M	STEVEN (O.S.)	Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a lot?
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Lance? He couldn't been more than 98 pounds.
M	STEVEN (O.S.)	Yeah, that's him.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Oh he was such an asshole. Actually- I was in the yard once. Another guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw this picture of a little girl about Steffie's age. So I brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. That's the thing about having kids, you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... And the next day, bedtime, there they were.
M	PHILLIP	How'd you know he'd do that?
F	STEVEN	I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for you... and I found a way to do it. That's all.
M	PHILLIP	Just listenin' huh?
F	STEVEN	That's it... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 59.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	I'm gonna get a Coke... you want a Coke? Uh huh... * Aw, you don't love me... *
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	With Phillip I felt strong. I felt invincible. I promised myself he would never want for anything ever again. That meant I needed a real job. Something dependable. And- no more scams.
M	LINDHOLM (O.S.)	Sorry to keep you waiting Steven.
M	LINDHOLM (CONT'D)	I'm Dan Lindholm. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 60.
F	STEVEN	Were you a spaceman?
F	LINDHOLM	Yep. Never got out there though. NASA's a real political place. Never could figure out whose ass to kiss to get a mission. All in the past. Barely even think about it now...
F	STEVEN	A spaceman, huh? How do you crap up there?
F	LINDHOLM	Ass gasket. Have a seat.
M	LINDHOLM (CONT'D)	With the popularity of HMO's in today's health care system, doctors need help managing their billing-- so they can focus on their patients. That's where USA Medical Management comes in. Hundreds of millions of dollars pass through our system from the HMO's to the doctors. It's a critical business. A powerful business... So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure what to think. Your level of education and your past experience would factor heavily into this decision and frankly...
M	LINDHOLM (CONT'D)	...you were head and shoulders above the rest. I mean, I could hardly believe it. But when I called your references-- well they couldn't speak more highly of you. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 61.
F	STEVEN	I could not speak more highly of Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter. We were damn lucky to have him at Prudential as long as we did.
M	PHILLIP	Brando's wet debut?
F	STEVEN	On the Waterfront.
F	LINDHOLM	Employee of the year two years running? Developing software with IBM? You're the kind of people we need here Steven. We want you as our Chief Financial Officer. So what do you say? I want your answer right now. C'mon Steven- let's light this candle.
M	RHEBA	...for example "he's in a meeting" sounds better than "he's away from his desk" at least I think so, but whatever you prefer.
F	STEVEN	That's fine... sure. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 62.
M	RHEBA	I pulled all the claims for the last two years as well as the statements, transfers and confirmations from the bank. Most of it's routine and I think you can get up to speed in a day or two. Anything else I can do for you?
F	STEVEN	Uh.... cup of coffee?
M	RHEBA	I'll do it today but I don't do that really.
M	MARK	Crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with training wheels.
M	BIRKHEIM	Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've only had the one quarter to play catch up but I tell you, we can't wait to get some insight here. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 63.
F	STEVEN	Sure. What about?
M	BIRKHEIM	Mark's projections.
F	STEVEN	Mmm hm. Sure.
M	BIRKHEIM	They seem kind of flat.
F	STEVEN	Oh. Okay. Ummm...
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I think maybe... well I could just read it to you but uh... it might be better to just uh...
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Well, I'll just show you. Todd?
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	If you look here at Mark's projections again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see they're just that- projections. Projections based on a model set by my predecessor. I decided to reject that model and do things a little differently. I want to show you my results. This is what we actually made in Q3-- Now let me tell you how I did it...
M	PHILLIP	The tux? Where are you going?
F	STEVEN	It's just a work thing. Were we supposed to--
M	PHILLIP	No- I just thought- it's fine. Where you going?
F	STEVEN	Some stupid gala ball thing...
M	PHILLIP	Gala? Oh... Sounds boring.
F	STEVEN	Yeah. I'll be home early. Promise.
F	LINDHOLM	You see that?
F	STEVEN	No... Oh- is it...?
F	LINDHOLM	Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right now. Just a satellite deployment. Nothing special... Just touching the face of God.
M	LINDHOLM (CONT'D)	I want you to meet my wife.
F	LINDHOLM	Bev- Ladies- I want you to meet Steven Russell, our CFO.
F	MRS. LINDHOLM	Oh I heard about you.
F	STEVEN	Good things I hope.
F	MRS. LINDHOLM	Yes and no. Don's bellyaching about how big your Christmas bonus is gonna be because you're making him so much money.
M	FACELIFT WIFE	Are you married Steven? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 66.
F	STEVEN	Uh... engaged.
M	BLONDE WIFE	Well where is she, sweetheart?
F	STEVEN	She works. Travels a lot. It's killing her she couldn't be here.
F	STEVEN	These are ready for Dan ...
F	VERA	Thanks Steven. You doin' good?
F	STEVEN	Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer's office. I asked him, "What's your fee?" He says, "I charge $50 for three questions." So I ask, "Don't you think that's a little expensive?" And he says, "Yes it is... Now what's your final question?"
F	VERA	It's so true. Lawyers!
M	VERA (CONT'D)	Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this!
M	BIRKHEIM	That's the thing about the back nine at Pebble Beach. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 67.
M	BIRKHEIM (CONT'D)	I don't care what your handicap is... that sand wedge is gonna get a workout-
F	LINDHOLM	I couldn't agree with you more. I remember one time, I was at Augusta...
M	SECRETARY	The woman says,"That's awful expensive, isn't it?" and the lawyer says, "Yes and now you only got one question left!"
M	SECRETARY (CONT'D)	`Cause he already asked the two!
F	LINDHOLM	Mushroom and cheese. Anyway like I was saying the Northrup guy says to the NASA "well that question's gonna cost fifty million to answer" so NASA says, "Don't you think that's a lot of money?" and Northrup says "Yep, now you owe us another fifty million. Next question please!"
F	STEVEN	Yeah that's a good one... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 68.
F	LINDHOLM	That's why there's so few shuttle missions. They're wasting all their money on bureaucracy. And probes... Unmanned probes. Like people care if there's life on Mars. No mushrooms, I said.
M	PHILLIP	Golf!?
F	STEVEN	What?
M	PHILLIP	You're a homosexual.
F	STEVEN	It's work.
M	PHILLIP	You know, you can tell them. They can't fire you for being gay.
F	STEVEN	I know...
M	PHILLIP	I'm trying to be understanding here honey, but golf? Why not just eat pussy?
F	STEVEN	Wish me luck.
M	PHILLIP	Good luck! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 69.
F	STEVEN	Oh! This is easy! Your turn Dan!
F	LINDHOLM	Hell of a hazard ain't it Steven?
M	STEVEN (O.S.)	Oh yeah! How ya like that, sister!?
M	CLIENT	So the black fella says to the jew lawyer- "50 bucks a question? Ain't that expensive?" "Yeah it's expensive," he says, "I'm a Jew, you nigger!"
M	CLIENT (CONT'D)	Get it?!! There I am. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 70.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Maybe it was because it's just my nature, or maybe it was because of my past... or maybe it was because they were the most boring fucking people I'd ever met in my life... Whatever the reason, I had been robbing them blind for months.
M	RHEBA	Anything else I can do for you?
F	STEVEN	Uh.... cup of coffee?
M	RHEBA	I'll do it today but I don't do that really.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	The thing about U-SAMM was that they took in all this HMO money and distributed it to doctors. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 71.
M	STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	But in the time between receiving the money and paying it out- it was just sitting there, not making interest or anything.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	It occurred to me to set up an investment account where the held money would earn interest for the short time that the company had it. We're talking twenty two million at any given time here, so even short term the interest adds up pretty quickly. I'd be making the company millions virtually overnight. ...and I of course would take a commission. Say... fifty percent. The only problem with that was-- I wasn't the one signing the checks.
F	STEVEN	So I ask, "Don't you think that's a little expensive?" and the lawyer says, "Yes it is, now what's your final question?"
F	VERA	It's so true. Lawyers!
M	VERA (CONT'D)	Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 72.
F	LINDHOLM	Steven, we got a problem. Vera lost that stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is a goddamned disaster and she's the o-ring if you know what I'm saying.
F	STEVEN	Oh... how long till we can get a new one?
F	LINDHOLM	Nope. Time to overhaul the program. I got a computerized system already on order. No more room for pilot error.
M	LINDHOLM (CONT'D)	Should be up and running in a couple months. I want you signing the checks until then.
F	STEVEN	Really?! Great!
F	LINDHOLM	You play golf?
F	STEVEN	Uhhh... yeah. Sure. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 73.
M	PHILLIP	How big was this Christmas bonus?
F	STEVEN	Pretty big.
M	PHILLIP	In July?
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	The sheriff is desperate and goes to a psychic. All the woman says is rabbit. Rabbit-rabbit-rabbit, that's all. Well he thinks `bullshit' and he's driving back home and what happens? He sees a rabbit crossing the street in front of him. So he pulls over and follows it into All wrecked and turned over and the girl's inside... still alive.
F	STEVEN	No.
M	PHILLIP	I swear. It's in the Ricky Martin People in the bathroom. Yeah... they can find out all sorts of stuff, those people.
F	STEVEN	Mmm hmm... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 74.
M	PHILLIP	They can find out anything about anyone... anything. They could even find out something about you...
F	STEVEN	Phillip... what is it?
M	PHILLIP	It's just-- Is something going on? Something you're not telling me?
F	STEVEN	No.
M	PHILLIP	Because if there is, stop now.
F	STEVEN	There isn't. There's nothing.
M	PHILLIP	I don't care about the money, the house, jet-skis- all I want is you. I just want us to be together.
F	STEVEN	We're always going to be together. And there is nothing going on. I promise. I wouldn't lie to you, baby.
M	BIRKHEIM	Nice car.
F	STEVEN	Thanks, Larry.
M	BIRKHEIM	Which one is it?
F	STEVEN	SL. That the C you're driving?
M	BIRKHEIM	Yeah.
F	STEVEN	Good car.
M	BIRKHEIM	Mmm hm.
F	STEVEN	Good value. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 76.
M	BIRKHEIM (O.S.)	I have some questions about these new accounts we've opened.
M	BIRKHEIM	Yeah... I was wondering if we could compare some numbers. I know you usually talk to our CFO but this is a delicate matter and I'd like keep it secret for now.
M	SECRETARY	Hi Mister Ru--
F	STEVEN	I'M MAKING COPIES!!! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 77.
M	AUTOMATED TELLER	Hello, you've reached the Automatic Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please enter your personal account number followed by the pound sign.
M	AUTOMATED TELLER (CONT'D)	Thank you. Your account balance is eight hundred-thirty seven thousand five hundred and two dollars and twelve cents. To repeat this-
F	STEVEN	CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SHREDDING!? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 78.
F	DEBBIE	Hello?
F	STEVEN	Hey Debbie.
F	DEBBIE	Steven. How are you?
F	STEVEN	Good. How's Steffie doing?
F	DEBBIE	Good. Real good. She sure is your daughter...
F	STEVEN	She's interested in boys already?
F	DEBBIE	Ha-ha. How's Phillip?
F	STEVEN	He's good. He says hi, but listen- I just wanted to call and let you know I'm switching all my phone numbers. I'll let you know when we get a new one.
F	DEBBIE	Oh Steven, are you on the lam again?
F	STEVEN	Deb, you always knew me best.
F	DEBBIE	Steven you really should stop all this, you are such a good man and I know that Jesus has a plan for you.
F	STEVEN	Well, maybe this is his plan.
F	DEBBIE	Now don't start. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 79.
F	STEVEN	Anyway Debbie- that's my boss calling. I love you both and I'll call you soon.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Hello?
F	LINDHOLM	Steven? Where are you?
F	STEVEN	The Gulf Freeway. Where are you?
F	LINDHOLM	At the office. You coming back anytime soon?
F	STEVEN	Is something wrong?
F	LINDHOLM	No, we just want to see you Steven. We miss you is what it is.
F	STEVEN	Oh, that's nice Dan. But I don't think I'm coming back in. I think we both know why.
F	LINDHOLM	You sure about that Steven?
F	STEVEN	Bye-bye Dan.
M	PHILLIP	People keep calling, what's going on? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 80.
F	STEVEN	Nothing. Thought we'd take a little vacation. Key West. Let's pack. Quick! Okay I'll pack for you!
M	PHILLIP	I fucking knew it- you did do something. You lied to me! You looked me right in the eye and lied!
F	STEVEN	Now don't get angry, it's gonna be fun, I swear.
M	PHILLIP	Are you going back to jail? Steven, you promised we'd always be together!
F	STEVEN	Of course we are! We're never gonna be apart. Never.
M	PHILLIP	You lying son of a bitch! You took advantage of me! Just like all the rest! SON OF A BITCH!
F	STEVEN	We'll get a place. Do some fishing. I can work on my key lime pie recipe...
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	...I might even grow a beard and enter the Papa Hemingway contest!
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Phillip? Honey?
F	STEVEN	COME BACK! WAIT! There I was, keeping secrets, living a lie. Like I said, I tend to do that. Now I didn't blame Phillip for running out on me, but I had to make things right. I had to get him back. You see, there's something I didn't tell you... ...it's about my old boyfriend. Do you remember him? His name was Jimmy. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 82.
M	KEMPLE	What? What?
F	STEVEN	I love you Jimmy.
M	KEMPLE	It's only been a month, Steven.
F	STEVEN	I know.
M	KEMPLE	Don't fall for me Steven.
F	STEVEN	Why the hell not?
M	KEMPLE	You know damn well why.
F	STEVEN	I don't give a shit about that.
M	KEMPLE	STEVEN! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 83.
M	KEMPLE	You need to do the time. I'll wait for you. I will. I'll wait for you. I promise. I love you. I'll wait for you.
F	STEVEN	Hi baby. What do you mean? It's noon. I always call at noon. Well it's prison honey, it sucks. But I'm getting used to it. What's wrong?
M	KEMPLE	I'm sick.
F	STEVEN	I know.
M	KEMPLE	No really sick. You haven't seen me in a year. You don't know. I just came back from the doctor. My T-cells are... Why did you have to go to jail? How could you do this to me? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 84.
F	STEVEN	I know, I'm sorry...
M	KEMPLE	I don't want to die alone.
F	STEVEN	You're not gonna die alone.
M	KEMPLE	Yes I am. Who knows how long I have.
F	STEVEN	You're not gonna die alone, okay? Just believe me.
M	KEMPLE	You don't know that.
F	STEVEN	Yes I do. I promise.
F	STEVEN	Did you get `em?
M	BLONDE INMATE	Yeah.
F	STEVEN	What the hell's this?
M	BLONDE INMATE	It's all I could get.

M	KEMPLE	Thanks Mom.
F	HELEN	I'll be in the other room.
F	STEVEN	Come on. You need to drink something.
M	KEMPLE	I want you to have this because I'm gonna be leaving soon...
F	STEVEN	Well that's not okay with me baby. You can't leave. I need you around here. You're the love of my life.
M	KEMPLE	You're sweet... but no, I'm not.
F	STEVEN	Shhhh...
M	KEMPLE	I'm not. I've seen him. You haven't met him yet, but you will...
M	KEMPLE (CONT'D)	You're gonna be so happy. And I know you don't think so, but you deserve to be happy...
F	STEVEN	You're not thinking clearly baby. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 87.
M	KEMPLE	Yes I am... And you have to promise me... When you find him, you're gonna treat him right... okay?
F	STEVEN	Okay, okay. Now drink some water.
M	KEMPLE	Treat him right.
F	HELEN	Who is it?
F	STEVEN	NO! JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME! I PROMISED! I PROMISED I'D BE THERE! I PROMISED HE WOULDN'T DIE ALONE!
F	STEVEN	It's about damn time! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 88.
F	STEVEN	Hi Helen it's me. Is-- Okay... mmm hmm...
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I just don't like talking about some things.
M	HOUSTON COP	This what you wanted?
F	STEVEN	Oh thanks.
M	HOUSTON COP	Diabetes huh?
F	STEVEN	Yeah... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 89.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	I wasn't going to lose Phillip. No way. I broke Jimmy's heart and I was not gonna break Phillip's. I was gonna make everything alright. No matter what it took, I was going to escape.
M	DRIVING COP	Fuck... what is that?
M	DRIVING COP (CONT'D)	Fuck!
M	HOUSTON COP	Ahh! He shit himself! Get us to the hospital!
F	STEVEN	Shit!
M	HOUSTON COP	He's up.
M	CORRECTIONS OFFICER	Take a seat.
M	FIRST PRISONER	What'd they get you for?
M	SECOND PRISONER	Grand Theft. You?
M	FIRST PRISONER	B and E.
M	SECOND PRISONER	How about you?
M	LEAD OFFICER	This slippery son of a bitch is going straight to lockup.
F	STEVEN	C'mon Phillip, pick up, it's me. I'm sorry. C'mon. Dammit!
M	NEW CELLMATE	How long you in for?
F	STEVEN	Not long. Can you hit me in the face with this?
M	PHYSICIAN	That's a pretty big gash. Just stay still...
F	STEVEN	It sure hurts... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 92.
M	NIGHT GUARD	`night Doc.
M	HOUSTON JUDGE	Set bail at 900,000 dollars.
M	ATTORNEY	Your honor...
F	STEVEN	Nine hundred thousand!? It's a white collar charge.
M	ATTORNEY	Your honor- Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 93.
M	HOUSTON JUDGE	Mister Russell is a flight risk. The bond is set. Nine hundred thousand.
F	STEVEN	This is bullshit. Set a reduction hearing.
M	ATTORNEY	Your honor we'd like to set a reduction hearing.
M	HOUSTON JUDGE	That's your right, but I strongly advise you don't.
M	HOUSTON JUDGE (CONT'D)	Fine. You can have your hearing tomorrow.
F	STEVEN	Next week.
M	ATTORNEY	We'd like next week if that's okay.
F	STEVEN	On the thirteenth.
M	ATTORNEY	Oh the thirteenth if possible.
M	HOUSTON JUDGE	Fine. Friday the thirteenth. Now go away. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 94.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won't beat around the bush. I got into a spot of trouble here in Houston and find myself needing help. That's right, jail again. Anyway I was wondering if you could type up this thing for me on your computer just like I sketched out...
F	STEVEN	Great!
F	STEVEN	Ma'am?! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 95.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	Dropped something.
M	CLERK	This is Julie.
F	STEVEN	Hi, I have Judge Charles Hearn for the clerk's office.
M	CLERK	Alright.
F	STEVEN	I'll put him through.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	This the clerk's office?
M	CLERK	It is.
F	STEVEN	Charles Hearn- I got a bail adjustment coming through, sent it over today.
M	CLERK	Sure thing. What's the name?
F	STEVEN	Russell. Steven Jay.
M	CLERK	Got it right here. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 96.
F	STEVEN	Good, I need that to go through right away. Because if it don't, I'm gonna have to chug about a quart of Tidee Bowl on account of all the shit I'll be eating. Know what I mean?
M	CLERK	You got it Judge.
F	STEVEN	And say- Julie? Can you save me a dime and connect me to a good bail bondsman?
M	JULIE	Sure thing.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Go away Steven!
M	PHILLIP (O.S.) (CONT'D)	You think I didn't know you were coming!?
F	STEVEN	Phillip-
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Get the hell out of here! I'm done with you!
F	STEVEN	Don't say that.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	They probably have a psychic after you right now! Did you see any bunnies!?
F	STEVEN	Honey, I know you're upset- but we love each other. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 97.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	You opened a bank account for Doctor Phillip Morris! Now they think I'm in on everything! I'm facing real time! You know I can't go back to prison.
F	STEVEN	I'm sorry about that- they weren't supposed to find that. It was for your own good. So we could be together.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	Fuck off! I'm in enough trouble.
F	STEVEN	C'mon Phillip, just trust me- FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING LIAR! Do you realize how bad you've fucked me over!! You made me an accomplice! You fucking liar! I don't want to see you. Go away! I never want to see you again!
F	STEVEN	Phillip don't say that. Well what am I supposed to do?
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	You're the lawyer, you figure it out.
M	PHILLIP (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Oh my God...
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	You're not even a lawyer?! You fucking liar!
F	STEVEN	Well...
M	PHILLIP (O.S.)	What the hell's going on?! Who the hell are you!? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 98.
F	STEVEN	Open the door Phillip. No.
F	STEVEN	Open the door. Just open the door. Open the door. Please. I just want to say one thing. Please. Just one thing. That's all. Please.
M	SWAT COMMANDER (O.S.)	Down on the ground faggots!!
M	SWAT COMMANDER (CONT'D)	DOWN! DOWN! NOW!
F	STEVEN	Phillip?
M	PHILLIP	Don't.
F	STEVEN	I love you. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 99.
M	PHILLIP	From the moment we met, you've done nothing but lie. Our whole relationship... just lies. I'm such an asshole. You took advantage of me- just like all the rest of them. You were supposed to protect me- but you've done nothing but make a fool of me. And you expect me to love you? How can I love you? I don't even know who you are. And you know what's sad? I don't even think you know who you are. So how am I supposed to love something that don't even exist? You tell me.
M	POLICEMAN (O.S.)	Morris. You're up.
M	PHILLIP	I will never forgive you Steven. Never.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	That was the last time I ever saw him.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	...But I knew he was right. Phillip, Jimmy, Debbie- they've all been right. My whole life was nothing but a bunch of lies. Lies to make people love me, lies to keep them from leaving me and lies to make them give me their money. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 100.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	And in the process I lost track of who I was. Maybe Barbra Bascombe had me pegged right from the beginning and that's why she gave me up...
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Whatever the case, how does a person who doesn't exist go on existing? Well the answer is- he doesn't.
M	BUNKMATE (O.S.)	Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to sleep. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 101.
M	MALE NURSE	I'll be right back.
M	YOUNG DOCTOR	I'm sorry to have to tell you this Steven, your t-cell counts indicate that, uh... Well... you have AIDS.
F	STEVEN	How long do I have?
M	DOCTOR	Where's the crash cart!? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 102. So here we are, where you first met me... I've been in this bed for months now. Waiting to die. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I might get a chance to see Phillip one more time. But I don't know how much longer I can do this...
M	SAMUEL	Got a minute?
M	PHILLIP	Samuel. You want some crackers?
M	SAMUEL	No... thanks. Look- I just talked to my friend- he's a nurse at the infirmary. I don't know if you know this or not but uh...
M	PHILLIP	LET ME IN! Just let me in! "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 103.
M	DOCTOR	He's not here!
M	PHILLIP	I need to see him!
M	DOCTOR	I told you he's not here! You need to calm down.
M	PHILLIP	Just tell me where he is. What happened?
M	DOCTOR	He slipped into a coma for a few days. He's conscious now, but he's very sick. We had him transferred to a private care facility. There was nothing we could do for him here. It's just a matter of time now.
M	CARETAKER (O.S.)	Steven?
M	CARETAKER (CONT'D)	Steven? Someone wants to talk to you. He keeps calling. He's driving us crazy.
M	CARETAKER (CONT'D)	Okay you can put him through. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 104.
F	STEVEN	I didn't want you to find out...
M	PHILLIP	Steven. Oh God... Why didn't you write me? I don't know how this happened, they say I'm fine. Oh God, who did this? It doesn't matter. I had to talk to you Steven. I am still angry with you, but I need you to know something. Even if sometimes I don't know who you are, I love you. I never stopped loving you. You and me are just fools for love I guess- written in the stars or some crap like that. But it was never better, never more real than with you Steven. I realize now that all that crazy shit you did- in your fucked up way- it was always for me. Always for us. You are the most amazing man Steven. It takes my breath away. And even though I can't be with you now, I will always be yours... Forever.
M	PHILLIP (CONT'D)	Now if you have to go, go. It's okay. I'm right there. Okay? I'm right there. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 105.
M	SAMUEL	Phillip...?
M	SAMUEL (CONT'D)	Uh- my friend in the infirmary... Uh, they got a call from that long term care place and uh, well a few days ago Steven- ...I'm so sorry Phillip.
M	BOSSY GUARD	Morris. Come with me.
M	PHILLIP	Where are we going?
M	BOSSY GUARD	Your lawyer's here. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 106.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Did I forget to mention I didn't die? Yeah, I didn't die. Faked the whole thing.
M	BUNKMATE (O.S.)	Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to sleep.
F	STEVEN	Fuck you. I got a broken heart here.
M	CLEAVON	Well then do something about it mother fucker- `stead of crying like Whitney Houston looking for her crack pipe.
F	STEVEN	Yeah I know...
M	CLEAVON	Damn right. Love creates miracles motherfucker. Ain't you ever read the Bible? So get off your ass and go forth unto the Canaanites you faggot bitch.
F	STEVEN	When you're right you're right Cleavon...
M	CLEAVON	Wanna suck me off?
F	STEVEN	No thanks.
M	CLEAVON	Well sweet dreams then. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 107.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Lying there in all my misery, I had a moment of clarity. It became clear to me- I had to get to Phillip. No matter what. Even if it meant dying...
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Faking your death from AIDS is no easy task, believe me. But after watching Jimmy die, I thought I could make it convincing. First, you have to starve yourself- I ate half as much every day for ten months. After that, you have to fake all sorts of symptoms.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	You gotta keep this up for months until you lose about, say, 80 pounds.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	But the hardest part is falsifying your records.
F	STEVEN	Hey Lawrence- you still work in the infirmary?
M	LAWRENCE	Mmm hmm... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 108.
F	STEVEN	You like coffee?
M	MALE NURSE	I'll be right back.
M	YOUNG DOCTOR	...you have AIDS.
F	STEVEN	How long do I have? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 109.
M	DOCTOR	Where's the crash cart!?
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	But the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility. It's standard procedure for late stage patients, but convincing them I was about to die would involve taking a few risks.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	After a four day coma, they were convinced.
F	STEVEN	This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin Center, Houston. I'm looking for AIDS patients for a study we're... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 110. And once I got settled in, I just called the Department of Corrections and convinced them I was a state-sponsored doctor looking for late stage AIDS patients for an experimental treatment. As luck would have it, they had one patient that was eligible...
F	STEVEN	Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you spell that?
M	ORDERLY	Mister Russell, the clinic sent a taxi here to pick you up.
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	And for all that time- all those doctors, all those nurses and all those facilities... not one of them ever thought to give me an AIDS test...
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Fucking Texas...
F	STEVEN	I had a special request when I ordered the cab. Did they tell you?
M	TAXI DRIVER	Yeah- right here.
F	STEVEN	Thank God.
M	STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	A week later, the hospice was to get a call from Doctor Rios, telling them Steven Russell had died undergoing treatment. And after all that hard work dying? Where's the first place I go?
M	STEVEN (V.O.)	Funny, huh?
M	PHILLIP	You're such a fucker!
F	STEVEN	I know- I'm sorry- You weren't supposed to find out.
M	PHILLIP	Well I did!
F	STEVEN	I couldn't take a chance telling you. You know that. I couldn't. But Phillip, I only did it so I could get here to you. Just to talk to you. And here I am. Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 112.
M	PHILLIP	You're so skinny.
F	STEVEN	I'm fine. Just hungry.
M	PHILLIP	Steven I don't-
F	STEVEN	Wait. Listen. I just came here to tell you one thing and that's it. You don't have to take me back, I just want to say one thing.
M	STEVEN (CONT'D)	I know you thought we were nothing but a lie- but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real. I thought about what you said to me. You said you don't know who I am. But I have to tell you- I know now. I know who I am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an escape artist. Those Steven Russells are dead. And now, all that's left is the man that loves you. That's all. Nothing else. I'm just the man that loves you. And if you can see that... believe it... then I promise I'll never be anything else ever again.
M	PHILLIP	How do I know you're not bullshitting me again?
F	STEVEN	You don't. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 113. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 114.
