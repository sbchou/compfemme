M	LOSER CAVEMAN	Loser kill beast. Now fuck off, Loser going back to sleep.
M	CHIEF CAVEMAN	Loser kill beast! Loser caveman hero!
M	NARRATOR	The world's first lie. A monumental occasion in the history of mankind. That lowly caveman who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become chief of his village, married dozens of cavewomen, and passed on the lying gene to hundreds of newborn cave-children. Over time lying spread throughout the world, sparking the eventual birth of imagination itself, story- telling, religion, and the oh-so- important polite lie, as in, "Oh Patty, have you lost weight? You look fantastic." The world would be a very different place if events had gone otherwise on that prolific, Paleolithic eve. If not for that night, man would have never acquired the ability to lie to himself and to others. A world without lying would be a world without dreams. A world without pretense. A world without fiction. A world without flattery. A world very unlike our own.
M	CHIEF CAVEMAN	Loser, what happen?
M	LOSER CAVEMAN	The Beast, it came at me. It smash my cave.
M	LOSER CAVEMAN	Rock fall on beast. Loser do nothing. I think Loser even soil bear pants. Loser smell bad.
M	CHIEF CAVEMAN	Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman, throw rocks at loser!
M	JENNIFER	Hi. You're early. I was just masturbating.
F	MARK	That makes me think of your vagina. I'm Mark, how are you?
M	JENNIFER	A little frustrated at the moment. Also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight. I'm Jennifer.
F	MARK	I hope this date ends in sex.
M	JENNIFER	Not me. I don't find you attractive. Come on in.
M	JENNIFER	I need to finish getting ready. While doing that I might realize I'm still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing.
F	MARK	I feel awkward and I regret being early. Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and I equally.
F	MARK	I have an erection now because I assume you began masturbating once we stopped talking.
F	MARK	I'm embarrassed because I think the restaurant I've made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you, but it was the best I could do because I don't make very much money. You see, I'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, I've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship. My boss even told me today that I'm most likely going to get fired tomorrow and...
M	JENNIFER	I just masturbated.
F	MARK	That makes me very horny.
M	JENNIFER	Shall we go?
F	MARK	Sure.
M	JENNIFER	After you.
M	JENNIFER	I'm only doing this as a favor for my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me to go out on a date with you. He says you're funny.
F	MARK	Greg's a good friend.
M	JENNIFER	Where are we eating tonight?
F	MARK	A cute little place called La Bonisera in West Hollywood.
M	JENNIFER	You obviously don't have very much money but that's not necessarily a deal breaker.
F	MARK	I have very little money.
M	JENNIFER	I also don't really care about a guy who knows all the latest, hippest restaurants.
F	MARK	I don't know any of them.
M	JENNIFER	In fact, there are very few things in life that I care about all that much. The only things I have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect. In fact, I think my best trait is the fact that I've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically. I take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light-hearted existence. Mostly though, I'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day I take the energy I expend on hyper self-reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life.
F	MARK	I found that boring and started thinking about this place's fish tacos.
M	VALET PARKING GUY	I'm extremely bored.
M	JENNIFER	Hello.
M	JENNIFER	This isn't as nice as I remember it.
F	MARK	What are we going to talk about?
M	HOSTESS	I'm threatened by you.
F	MARK	Two, please.
M	HOSTESS	Of course, come with me.
M	WAITER	I'm very embarrassed that I work here. Hi.
F	MARK	Hello.
M	JENNIFER	Hello.
M	WAITER	And you're pretty and that only makes me feel worse. Can I get you two started on some drinks?
F	MARK	I'll have a Budweiser.
M	JENNIFER	I'll start with your Mango Margarita and probably have three more drinks by the end of the night.
M	WAITER	Excellent. She's out of your league.
F	MARK	Yup.
M	WOMAN	All of a sudden I got EXTREMELY angry!
F	MARK	I'm going to ask you some questions about your life because that's what you do, but I'll only really listen to about half of what you're saying.
F	MARK	How do you spend your days?
M	JENNIFER	I get up at eight in the morning because the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep, so I lean over and...
F	MARK	That's a little more specific than I expected.
M	JENNIFER	Well what did you want to know?
F	MARK	Do you have a job?
M	JENNIFER	Yes.
F	MARK	What job do you have?
M	JENNIFER	I have a job at an office.
F	MARK	What do you do?
M	JENNIFER	Just typing and filing and stuff.
F	MARK	Do you enjoy it?
M	JENNIFER	No. But I enjoy the end result of the job which is money. And the hours are pretty good for the amount of money I make, which I spend on things I like, such as clothes, hiking, drinking -- even though I know it's bad for me. But I'd rather just get all the money and not work for the results.
F	MARK	Sure. Tell me more. I'm trying to get a little insight into you.
M	JENNIFER	Well you already know a lot about me. You know I'm good looking because... well... here I am. You know I'm successful because you've seen my apartment and the clothes I'm wearing. And you know I'm happy because I'm smiling.
F	MARK	Are you always happy?
M	JENNIFER	Usually. Some days I stay in bed eating and crying.
F	MARK	Sure.
M	WAITER	Here you go. I had a sip of this.
M	JENNIFER	Okay.
M	WAITER	Do you guys know what you want or do you need a moment?
F	MARK	I'm ready.
M	JENNIFER	I'll have a caesar salad with chicken because I think I'm fat but I also think I deserve something that tastes good.
F	MARK	I'll have the fish taco's because I had them once here and it's all I know.
M	WAITER	Excellent, I'll get those both started for you.
M	JENNIFER	Sorry, one second.
M	JENNIFER	It's my mother, this won't take long. Probably checking in on our date.
M	JENNIFER (ON PHONE)	Hello? Yes, I'm with him right now. No, not very attractive. No, doesn't make much money. He's all right though. Seems nice. Kind of funny. A bit fat. Funny little snub nose. No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight. Nope, probably not even a kiss. Okay, you too. Bye.
M	JENNIFER	Sorry about that.
F	MARK	Don't think twice. How is your mom?
M	JENNIFER	She's all right.
F	MARK	Fantastic.
M	WAITER	If I give you my number will you call me?
M	JENNIFER	No.
F	MARK	Thanks for going on this date with me. You're way, way out of my league and I know you were just doing it as a favor to Greg, and that most likely I'll never hear from you again.
M	JENNIFER	I actually had a better time than I thought I'd have, but I won't know for sure how I feel about you until I'm less drunk.
F	MARK	Give me a call if you still like me once you're sober.
M	JENNIFER	I might.
F	MARK	Thanks for kissing me on the cheek, I know you didn't have to do that and....
F	MARK	... you're very pretty. Thank you!
M	JIM	Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company. I'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. I'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, I'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. It's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it I can say. We changed the can around a little bit. See, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids. Also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a Ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time. Coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts. So that's it, it's coke. Everyone knows it. It's very famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke, and I'm asking you to not stop buying coke. That's all. Thanks.
M	FRANK	Hi Mark. How's it going?
F	MARK	Not so good. Last night I went on a date with a girl I've had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get fired today. You?
M	FRANK	I spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because I'm too afraid to take enough to kill myself.
F	MARK	See you tomorrow.
M	FRANK	Bye.
M	BUSINESS MAN	I'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. I only want people to assume I'm very busy.
M	GIRLFRIEND	I woke up this morning and realized that, not only do I not love you, but that the thought of touching you sickens me.
M	BOYFRIEND	The more you hate me the more I fall in love with you.
M	HONKING MAN	Move it, fatty!
M	SCREAMING MAN	This isn't natural! None of this is natural! We're all animals! This doesn't feel right! Why am I wearing clothes? How can you people live like this? Where did all this concrete come from?!
M	WOMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT	I don't want to go in there today. I just don't. You know?
M	TOUR GUIDE	All of Lecture Films' productions are written, filmed and edited right here on this very lot. In fact, this building is where Lecture Films' talented writers scour through the world's past events, searching for the most entertaining, dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history, which are then turned into scripts, handed over to our world-famous Readers, and filmed for your viewing pleasure.
M	TOUR GUIDE	If you'll just follow me over to this monitor you'll get a sneak peak at Lecture Film's upcoming summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon 1812 to 1813."
M	NARRATOR	Coming this summer from Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios. Written by Oscar winning screenwriter Rob Marlowe. And starring Oscar winning Reader Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic sequel to last year's most talked about film: "Napoleon 1810 to 1811". Prepare for the adventure.
M	NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE	And so Napoleon invaded Russia with a brute force of nearly seven hundred thousand men behind him armed with muskets and supported by canon brigades.
M	NARRATOR (O.S.)	Learn of his defeat.
M	NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE	Through the devastating snow they marched, crippled by disease and hunger, Napoleon's men marched on.
M	NARRATOR (O.S.)	Listen to his redemption.
M	TOURIST #1	I love these films. Saves me reading the book.
M	NARRATOR	Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this summer from Lecture Films.
M	TOUR GUIDE	Look everyone, there goes Mark Bellison, one of Lecture Films very own screenwriters!
M	TOUR GUIDE	He's one of our least successful writers here at Lecture Films. I also hear he's most likely getting fired today.
M	TOUR GUIDE	Now let's head to editing bay where we can watch....
F	MARK	Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to you today.
F	SHELLEY	Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more and more how over-qualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours.
F	MARK	Any messages?
F	SHELLEY	Anthony's coming by within the hour to see if he can work up the courage to fire you. If he can't, he said he'll definitely do it tomorrow.
F	MARK	Nobody else called? No calls to do with actual work?
F	SHELLEY	Well, I told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned, so no one left any messages.
F	MARK	Next time I'd rather you took down the messages just in case I don't get fired.
F	SHELLEY	You're almost definitely getting fired.
F	MARK	Well, it hasn't happened yet.
F	SHELLEY	Okay, but everybody knows you are.
F	MARK	Okay, I'll be in my office.
F	SHELLEY	Okay, I'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist.
M	ANTHONY	Wow, you look really depressed today. That's going to make this so much harder.
F	MARK	Anthony, don't fire me.
M	ANTHONY	Mark, the 1300's are boring. Nothing interesting happened in that century. Nobody cares about the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment era. The last few scripts you turned in were depressing.
F	MARK	They were about the black plague! It's the 1300's Anthony, what else am I going to write about!
M	ANTHONY	It's not totally your fault, Mark. You got stuck with a bad century.
F	MARK	No! I can make it work!
M	ANTHONY	Give it up Mark, it's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300's. At Lecture Films we're no longer interested in searching through the less well- known historical periods for great events, we just want to take the big name Reader's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love: the holocaust, D-day, the birth of electricity. These are the stories people want to see, because they know them. They find comfort in them.
M	ANTHONY	Do you think I could come back and do this tomorrow? I just got very nervous about firing you. I don't do well with confrontation.
F	MARK	Is there anyway you could do it now? I'd rather not put it off.
M	ANTHONY	You're fired?
F	MARK	Damn. romantically. I'm just too far out of your league. --
F	MARK	She's a really good writer, too.
F	SHELLEY	I loathed almost every minute I worked for you.
F	MARK	I often fantasized about you naked.
F	SHELLEY	What are you going to do now?
F	MARK	I have no idea. But I have very little hope for the future.
F	SHELLEY	I don't have much hope for you either, but I wish you good luck.
F	MARK	Bye, Shelley.
F	SHELLEY	Bye, Mark.
M	ROB	So they fucking fired you, huh dipshit? I always knew the Black Plague would never work as a movie. Guess the 1300's were as much of a loser as you are.
F	MARK	Please don't make me feel worse. Or actually whatever, go ahead, I don't think I could possibly feel worse.
M	ROB	I fucking always hated you. You're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch. But I was always threatened by you because I knew there was something different about you that I didn't understand and I fucking hate things I don't understand. But you will always be a loser and I will always be more successful than you in nearly every way. That's just the way it is. And Shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back.
F	MARK	Well, now I feel worse.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Are you looking to abandon an elderly person?
F	MARK	I already have. Martha Bellison. I'm her grandson.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Ooh, it's good you're here. She's not doing well. You should say your final goodbyes today.
F	MARK	You say that every time I'm here.
M	RECEPTIONIST	She's at the top of our death pool.
M	ELDERLY PERSON #1	You look like my dead son.
M	ELDERLY PERSON #3	Life gets worse with each passing minute.
M	ELDERLY PERSON #4	I'm on pills that make everything orange.
F	MARK	Oh Grandma, that is so depressing. Come on, at least stare at the ceiling or something.
F	MARTHA	The television is broken.
F	MARK	The television isn't broken. You probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again.
F	MARK	See, you had it on the wrong channel. It needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work.
F	MARTHA	I don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry. I can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid. But I also love you and wish things were better for you.
F	MARTHA	I do too.
F	MARK	Grandma, I lost my job today. I'm forty years old. I'm completely alone and I've got absolutely no prospects for anything.
F	MARTHA	I'm sorry, Mark. Things aren't any better for me here. I can't afford most of my medication, I'm very alone and I forget more and more every day.
F	MARK	I'm just so tired of life. Why does life have to be so... what's the word? Don't you sometimes wish you could change things? Don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a loser?
F	MARTHA	I don't think I'm a loser.
F	MARK	Of course you're a loser, grandma. Our family is made up of losers. We're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved.
F	MARTHA	Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. And we're only lonely and unloved right now. Remember, I've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime. And maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too.
F	MARK	Yeah, but I'm not talking about the past, Grandma. I'm talking about right now. And right now we're both losers, Grandma. We're both shitty, shitty losers. Don't you know that?
F	MARTHA	I suppose we are. But things could be worse. We could be homeless.
F	MARK	I'd rather be dead than be homeless. That's why I need to get out there and find a job. If I have to be homeless, I'm going to kill myself.
F	MARTHA	Well that's sad. I love you, Mark. Good luck finding a job!
F	MARK	I love you too, Grandma.
M	MARTHA (O.S.)	Oops.
F	MARK	I'll start looking for a job tomorrow.
M	GREG	Lately I don't like Indian people. I don't like white people even more though. I fucking hate white people. I fucking hate people.
F	MARK	Hey, thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way.
M	GREG	Third cousin. She's hot right?
F	MARK	Very.
M	GREG	Way out of your league. Dunno why you bothered.
F	MARK	It felt nice to go out with someone that pretty. Like for just one moment I experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date. It felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I will always be just who I am right now: average looking, of average intelligence with an average personality. Just a completely generic human being.
M	GREG	Your life is still better than mine.
F	MARK	By a good margin.
M	GREG	Lately I've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine.
F	MARK	I really wish I had a better friend than you.
M	GREG	So, what are you going to do now?
F	MARK	I don't know. Guess I'll start looking for another crappy job.
M	GREG	Doubt you'll find one. Not much need for an out-of-work writer specializing in the Black Plague.
F	MARK	I'm going to go now. You're seriously depressing me. I really wish I was cool enough to have a better friend than you.
M	GREG	I'm the best you're gonna get, man. Call me later.
F	MARK	Yeah.
M	JENNIFER (ON PHONE)	Hello?
M	JENNIFER (ON PHONE)	Hello? I can hear you breathing. Is this a rapist?
F	MARK	No, it's Mark. I'm sorry.
F	MARK	Shut the fuck up, I don't even have a job!
M	LANDLORD	I'm here for the rent.
F	MARK	I was going to come talk to you about that. I got fired yesterday.
M	LANDLORD	I know. That's why I'm here for the rent.
F	MARK	Well, I haven't got it.
M	LANDLORD	How much do you have?
F	MARK	I think I've got about three hundred dollars in my bank account.
M	LANDLORD	The rent is eight hundred dollars.
F	MARK	I know. I haven't got it.
M	LANDLORD	Then you're evicted. I'll help you with your things.
M	LANDLORD	Help me with the couch. It looks heavy.
M	LANDLORD	You have one day to get your things out of this hallway.
F	MARK	How am I supposed to do that?
M	LANDLORD	You've got three hundred dollars. Rent a truck.
F	MARK	Oh, fuck me.
M	BANK TELLER	How can I help you today?
F	MARK	I'd like to make a withdrawal.
M	BANK TELLER	Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help you with that.
F	MARK	I've just been evicted from my apartment so I need to withdraw what I have left in my account so I can move my things out. I guess I need to close out my account to do that. I think I'm about to be homeless.
M	BANK TELLER	Unfortunately sir the system is down right now so I'm not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up. But I can assist you in a withdrawal. How much would you like to withdraw?
F	MARK	Well, I'd like to withdraw eight hundred dollars.
M	BANK TELLER	How much are you going to withdraw today, sir?
F	MARK	All of it. Just whatever is left.
M	BANK TELLER	The system is down, sir. Please tell me how much you have in your account?
M	BANK TELLER	Sir?
F	MARK	Eight hundred dollars.
M	BANK TELLER	Pardon me?
F	MARK	I have eight hundred dollars in my bank account.
M	BANK TELLER	Wait a second here. The system just came back up. System seems to be back up, guys. Just one second while I access your account. You said you're withdrawing eight hundred, correct?
F	MARK	Yup.
M	BANK TELLER	Well, look at this. It says here you've only got three hundred dollars in your account. But you said you wanted to withdraw eight hundred?
M	BANK TELLER	I apologize for this sir, but it seems our system has made a mistake. Hold on one second while I go and get your eight hundred dollars. Did you want that in large or small bills?
F	MARK	Large bills.
M	BANK TELLER	Guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy. Will someone call James to come in and look into it, please?
M	BANK TELLER	There you are. Eight hundred dollars. Anything else I can do for you today?
M	BANK TELLER	Sometimes our computers can get a bit buggy, especially when the system goes down. Sorry for any inconvenience.
F	MARK	It's no problem.
M	LANDLORD	What are you doing here?
F	MARK	Paying my rent.
M	LANDLORD	Where did you get this money?
F	MARK	It was amazing. I went in to the bank and the system was down and I was going to take out three hundred dollars but she asked me how much I'd like to take out and...
F	MARK	I found it. Lying on the street.
M	LANDLORD	Okay. Lucky.
F	MARK	Give me my key back.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Today I stumbled upon something no man has ever stumbled upon before. What I have done today they will write about in history books for generations to come. And yet, only moments ago... it was unfathomable not only to myself, but to mankind as a whole. What I have found there is no word for. And it was as simple as... ... how do I explain this... ... I said something... that wasn't.
M	GREG	Huh?
F	MARK	I said something... that... wasn't. I... what's the word I'm looking for? Well, there is no word. Of course there's not, I just invented it.
F	MARK	Here. Watch. Jim.
M	JIM	What?
F	MARK	My name is Doug.
M	GREG	Your name is Doug.
M	JIM	Hi Doug.
M	GREG	It amazes me that I never knew your real name. Doug is good. It suits you.
F	MARK	Come on guys. Are you serious? What's my name? It's Doug.
M	JIM	Doug.
F	MARK	No. My name is Mark.
M	GREG	Your name is Mark.
M	JIM	Hi Mark.
M	GREG	Mark suits you much better.
M	JIM	Mark-o.
F	MARK	You guys aren't following me. Okay, guys...I'm black.
M	GREG	I knew it.
M	JIM	You're very light skinned, but I can see it.
M	GREG	I've always wanted a black friend.
F	MARK	Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo.
M	GREG	Fantastic.
M	JIM	I've never seen a black Eskimo.
F	MARK	Okay, I'm a pirate.
M	GREG	I didn't know they still had those.
M	JIM	Are you a dangerous pirate?
F	MARK	Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and I have purple hair.
M	GREG	Aren't you scared you'll get bitten one day?
M	JIM	I want to die my hair purple just like Mark's.
M	JIM	I'm a one-armed Jewish space explorer.
M	GREG	When's your launch date?
M	JIM	Shalom. How'd you lose your arm?
F	MARK	I invented the bicycle.
M	GREG	I love your work.
M	JIM	Can you get me a discount on a ten speed?
F	MARK	I give up. And I'm bored.
F	MARK	Guys, if you had the power to make things the way you wanted them, what would you do first? If I could do anything in the world?
M	JIM	Anything at all?
F	MARK	Pretty much.
M	GREG	I'd bone bitches asses.
M	JIM	Right in the ass.
F	MARK	Specifically the ass?
M	GREG	If I could change things I would make all the hot chicks bone me.
M	JIM	Agreed.
F	MARK	Alright then, let's try that.
M	GREG	Where are you going?
F	MARK	Out.
M	BLONDE	Don't look at me, I'm not attracted to you.
F	MARK	Wait!
M	BLONDE	Don't bother. I've heard it all before.
F	MARK	THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW! or do we have to do it right here?
M	BLONDE	I'm sorry, I'm just so scared. I don't want the world to end. I don't want to die in this motel room. I think I'm going to throw up. Help me get my pants off.
F	MARK	This isn't right.
M	BLONDE	No! We have to have sex! The world is going to end! Think of the children and little babies!
F	MARK	Just calm down for one second.
M	BLONDE	How can I be calm? The world might end any second! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!
F	MARK	Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh, good. That's very good news. Good news indeed.
F	MARK	We're going to be okay. The world isn't going to end. Everyone is going to be fine.
M	BLONDE	WE'RE GOING TO LIVE! We're going to live! Thank you! Thank you!
M	BLONDE	This has been the worst... and the best... day of my life.
F	MARK	Okay, I gotta go.
M	BLONDE	Oh no, please stay. We've been through so much together.
F	MARK	I'm an asshole.
M	BLONDE	Well, I hate assholes. Get out of here.
F	MARK	That was one of the worst experiences of my life.
M	GREG	Did you invent a new kind of bike?
F	MARK	What else would you do if you could do anything in the world?
M	GREG	Bone chicks asses. That's what I'd do.
F	MARK	What else though. What's the second thing you'd do.
M	GREG	What else would you do, dipshit?
F	MARK	I'd get money. I'd get all the money.
F	MARK	Yeah. Let's do that. Greg, let's go.
M	GREG	What?
F	MARK	We're going on a trip.
M	GREG	I'll drive.
F	MARK	Thanks for driving man, I'm completely plastered.
M	GREG	I'm just as hammered as you. But I don't care if I get arrested. I'm trying to hit bottom.
M	GREG	Here comes bottom.
M	COP	Nothing safer than pulling over two nerdy white guys in their forties.
M	GREG	I don't want to go to jail.
M	COP	Are you drunk?
M	GREG	Yes.
M	COP	Then you're going to jail. Blow in here, son.
F	MARK	Wait, officer. Don't do that.
M	COP	I don't think you can afford my bribe, son.
F	MARK	How much does it cost to bribe you?
M	COP	At least five grand.
M	MARK AND GREG	Wow, that's high.
M	COP	I need to feel that I've got some sense of integrity.
M	COP	Whoa, that's off the charts. Step out of the car, son. You're drunk and going to jail.
F	MARK	Wait. He's not drunk.
M	COP	Oh.
M	COP	Damn thing must be broken.
M	COP	Son, you might want to drive yourself to the nearest hospital. You have food poisoning or some kind of flu.
M	COP	Maybe you oughta drive, son.
F	MARK	Good idea.
F	MARK	That was awesome!
M	GREG	Stop laughing, I'm sick.
F	MARK	You're gonna be all right, Greg.
M	GREG	Oh good!
M	GREG	Stupid stomach flu. Where are we going?
F	MARK	Vegas, baby. Vegas.
M	GREG	What are we doing here? We don't have any money to throw away.
F	MARK	Sure we do.
M	GREG	What is that, a few hundred bucks? That's not going to last us very long.
F	MARK	Sure it will.
F	MARK	Chips please.
M	CHIP WOMAN	There's a very good chance you'll lose all this money here tonight.
F	MARK	I know.
M	CHIP WOMAN	And even if you do happen to win, there's an even better chance that in the long run we'll win it back.
F	MARK	I know.
M	CHIP WOMAN	Some of the games are fixed. Like all the ones that use computers.
F	MARK	I know.
M	COCKTAIL WAITRESS	If I could be a stripper I would, but I'm not attractive enough. Drinks, guys?
M	GREG	No. I have a stomach flu.
F	MARK	We'll both have beers and we'll take them at that roulette table over there.
M	GREG	Oh come on, roulette is the stupidest game of them all. It's pure chance, no skill whatsoever.
F	MARK	It's okay. I'm feeling lucky.
M	GREG	You've never had a lucky day in your life.
F	MARK	Just watch.
M	ROULETTE DEALER	Get your bets in, get your bets in. The house always wins in the long run. Because of the zero's on the board every bet is slightly favored towards the house.
M	ROULETTE DEALER	Twenty-seven red. No one wins.
F	MARK	I'm on twenty-seven red.
M	ROULETTE DEALER	We have a winner. Congratulations, sir.
M	GREG	You did it. You just, like, quadrupled your money. You lucky son of a bitch.
F	MARK	That's nothing. Watch this.
M	ROULETTE DEALER	Get your bets in, get your bets in. The house always wins in the long run. Fork over your money right here folks. I say this so often I want to kill myself.
M	ROULETTE DEALER	Nine black. No winners.
F	MARK	I'm on nine black. These are all mine.
M	ROULETTE DEALER	Nine black wins. Big winner. Congratulations, sir.
M	GREG	Do it again.
F	MARK	I don't think I should. Lets go play slots.
F	MARK	Hi, I just won a major jackpot on this slot machine but no money came out.
M	PIT MAN	I'm sorry about that, sir. Let me get that fixed for you. And can I say congratulations, sir.
F	MARK	Thank you. This is the most amazing night of my life.
M	GREG	It amazes me the winning streak you're on. You must be the luckiest man in the world.
F	MARK	Well, sort of.
M	GREG	It was like we couldn't lose.
F	MARK	We couldn't lose.
M	GREG	Do you have a system?
F	MARK	I've got a system.
M	GREG	Well, with your system in just a few weeks I figure we could be the richest people in the world.
F	MARK	And then what?
M	GREG	Well, here's what I'm thinking. We take all the money in the world... and put it on black.
F	MARK	Why put it on black? Why stop there? Put it on a number and get thirty five times back.
M	GREG	That's exactly what we'll do.
F	MARK	Hold on, I think I found a flaw in your plan. How can they pay us if we have all the money in the world?
M	GREG	Well, they'd just have to.
F	MARK	Well, they can't because we've got it all.
M	GREG	Well, they'd better find it. They can't let us bet if they're not going to pay us back. They'll have to just give us the casino.
F	MARK	We already own the casino. We've got all the money in the world. We'll be betting against ourselves.
M	GREG	Then we'll go to another casino.
F	MARK	We own that one too. We won that.
M	GREG	So we own all the casino's?
F	MARK	Yup.
M	GREG	And if we win we can't pay us back because we already have all the money?
F	MARK	Yes.
M	GREG	Only one thing we can do then.
F	MARK	I'm listening.
M	GREG	Take ourselves into the back room and break our own fingers.
F	MARK	Brilliant.
F	MARK	Hey there, Frank.
M	FRANK	Mark. How's it going?
F	MARK	Pretty good, thanks.
M	FRANK	Really?
F	MARK	Yeah. You?
M	FRANK	Awful. I was doing some internet research last night about suffocation suicide. I'm probably going to give that a try tonight.
F	MARK	Oh. All right. Bye, Frank.
M	FRANK	Bye.
F	MARK	Frank!
M	FRANK	Yeah?
F	MARK	Don't do it.
M	FRANK	Why not? I'm miserable. And no one will care.
F	MARK	I'll care.
M	FRANK	You're a loser, though.
F	MARK	Don't do it, Frank. Things are going to be all right.
M	FRANK	They are?
F	MARK	Yes. You're going to meet someone soon. You won't be so lonely. Things are going to turn around at your job.
M	FRANK	My job's actually fine.
F	MARK	Well, things are going to get better. Better than they are.
M	FRANK	What about the depression?
F	MARK	It will go away very soon. You're going to be happy soon, Frank. You just need to wait for it. Listen to me: you don't need to kill yourself.
M	FRANK	Really?
F	MARK	Really.
M	FRANK	Wow. Man, and that suffocation thing really seemed like a good idea.
F	MARK	It wasn't.
M	FRANK	Okay. Well, my night's open now. You want to hang out later?
F	MARK	I don't know. Not really.
F	MARK	Sure. Of course. Let's hang out.
M	FRANK	I'll see you after work.
F	MARK	Great.
M	MARK (V.O.)	I've discovered something today very important... and very powerful.
M	MARK (V.O.)	I'm as excited as I've ever been in my entire life, and equally scared.
M	MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)	I'm writing this down in a letter in case this thing I've discovered somehow ends up killing me. I want to ensure that, even if I wasn't strong enough to use it, that my invention doesn't once again disappear, never to be discovered again.
M	MARK (V.O.)	In just a few hours since I stumbled upon my discovery I have seen its potential for evil and I have seen its potential for good.
M	MARK (V.O.)	I must be careful with my discovery, for at this point I barely understand it, let alone think I have the power to control it. All I know is that if I'm not careful I could easily do irreparable damage to the world, or even cause my own premature death.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Now, to explain my invention. In essence, my creation is the act of saying words that simply are not. For example, if I tell someone that my eyes are blue, then it simply becomes fact. I still know that, indeed, my eyes are brown, but no one else is aware of this fact, so therefore I have blue eyes. It's a game of numbers: there is only one of me who knows I have brown eyes, and so many of them who do not. The numbers always win.
F	MARK	Whoever is reading this, go ahead and try it. Tell someone your eyes are a different color then they are. I think you'll be amazed at the results. It's so simple and yet... so powerful... this thing I've invented.
M	MARK (V.O.)	Au Revoir, future reader, au revoir.
F	MARK	Jennifer. It's Mark.
M	JENNIFER	Are you gonna hang up on me again?
F	MARK	No. Maybe. Who knows. I'm calling because I want to ask you out on another date.
M	JENNIFER	Why would you do that?
F	MARK	I discovered something yesterday. I found out I can pretty much have my life anyway I want it from now on.
M	JENNIFER	Congratulations. I gotta go.
F	MARK	Wait, and I know you said you didn't want to date me ever again, but I'm different now. Things have changed. I think I'm in your league now.
M	JENNIFER	You're better looking?
F	MARK	No. I'm not better looking. I'm just more... powerful. I think you have to see it for yourself.
M	JENNIFER	Have you been to the gym?
F	MARK	No, I haven't been to the gym. It's just... it's amazing. Things are different for me now. You have to see this. I think you'll hardly recognize me.
M	JENNIFER	Did you buy better clothes?
F	MARK	No, look can we just meet up?
F	MARK	Jennifer, If there was even a glimmer of something about me that you liked, please say yes. You even admitted that we got along well. Just give me one more chance. Just one little teensy, tiny date.
M	JENNIFER	Okay, fine.
F	MARK	Fantastic. Tomorrow night. I'll pick you up at eight.
M	JENNIFER	Most likely it'll be our last date though, so just know that.
F	MARK	That's very sweet.
M	JENNIFER	No it wasn't. Did you not hear what I said?
F	MARK	Yeah, no I was being... ...there's no word for it. See you tomorrow night.
M	JENNIFER	Bye. In Our World.... in the 1800's...
M	MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V)	... came the greatest revolution of them all. The Industrial Revolution.
M	MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V)	Written by famed screenwriter Rob Marlowe and read by Oscar winning Reader Angelo Badsmith.
M	ANGELO BADSMITH	Hello, I'm Angelo Badmsith. Come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the Industrial Revolution. Also, I will tell you all about my personal misfortunes, such as my wife who cheated on me with a man named Perry.
F	MARK	Rob Marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end.
M	SHELLEY (O.S.)	He's gone crazy!
M	ROB	Come to beg for your old job back? Hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the Black Plague would make for an interesting film. Good luck, douche bag. Freaking loser.
M	ANTHONY (ON PHONE)	They're going to fire me any moment, I just know it. I'm really, really horrible at my job. I don't know anything about movies. I don't even like movies. I like sports. Head of development, what does that even mean? I'm not a smart person. Okay, talk to you later.
M	ANTHONY	That was the head of the studio. I'm very scared that you're mad at me about the whole firing thing.
F	MARK	I'm not mad at all.
M	ANTHONY	Oh good, because I feel really bad about it. I mean, I would be horrible at your job too. I would be horrible at any job in this place. I love sports.
M	ANTHONY	Why are you here?
F	MARK	When you fired me, I was very depressed.
M	ANTHONY	I knew it.
F	MARK	And so I left this building and I just started walking. And I walked all the way out of town. And then I walked into the desert and I fell asleep under a tree.
M	ANTHONY	I don't do well with other people's life changing events.
F	MARK	And when I woke up I found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground. So I started digging. And I unearthed a very old and ancient box. Probably, oh... about... seven hundred years old. And inside the box... ... was this.
M	ANTHONY	What is it?
F	MARK	It's a never-before-heard historical event from the past.
M	ANTHONY	When does it take place?
F	MARK	The 1300's.
M	ANTHONY	I told you we're not interested in Black Plague movies here, Mark.
F	MARK	This one isn't about the black plague. Well it isn't just about the black plague. Let me read you some of this.
F	MARK	Anthony, get excited about this. This is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before. It's a great human discovery.
M	ANTHONY	Yeah, but is there a movie there?
F	MARK	The greatest movie Lecture Films has ever made.
M	ANTHONY	Start reading.
F	MARK	On the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred. It began as a day much like any other. The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry. But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon.
M	ANTHONY	What?!
M	ANTHONY (ON PHONE)	I want everyone in here now! We've got a BIG ONE.
M	ANTHONY	Please, Mark. Continue.
F	MARK	As the smoke cleared, the door to the spaceship opened and inside, were hundreds of beautiful, half naked alien women.
F	MARK	And then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian Alien Women all in one sweeping motion. The earth was saved. Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry by alien king Xardon. It was to be the First Human-Nude Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared. All of Babylon and Mars were invited to join in the celebrations.
F	MARK	The wedding was held on a brisk summers day on Mars, with all of the survivors of the Great Ninja War and the Black Plague present. They feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion. The moment the bride and groom kissed, King Xardon performed a mind-wipe on all of the humans, thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds, and sent them back to Babylon. For seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day, a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison, would stumble upon them in the desert, after being fired by his shit boss Anthony and mocked by Rob and Shelly, two huge douche bags. Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success, and Mark would become very wealthy and famous from it. The End.
M	ANTHONY	Mark, tell us what it's called.
F	MARK	The Black Plague.
M	JENNIFER	Congratulations on selling your script today.
F	MARK	Thanks. Thank you for having dinner with me. Everyone needs to eat. And I enjoy your company.
M	WAITER	I'm an extremely important waiter. What can I get you?
F	MARK	I don't want to know what it is, I just want to order the most expensive thing on the menu.
M	JENNIFER	I'll have the duck. And I think you look like a little rat faced man.
M	WAITER	Okay, I'll have those right up for you.
M	JENNIFER	Things seem to be turning around for you.
F	MARK	Today is the best day of my life. Hands down. Easy. Best day.
M	JENNIFER	It's not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money.
F	MARK	That wasn't the best part. It was great, but it wasn't the peak of my day. I've had a crush on you ever since I saw a picture of you on Greg's refrigerator two years ago.
M	JENNIFER	Oh. The best part of my day today is right now, sitting at this table here with you.
M	JENNIFER	Oh.
F	MARK	You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life, and you're special... and it makes me happy to be around you.
M	JENNIFER	Thank you.
M	JENNIFER	Tell me something about your family. I really don't know much about you.
F	MARK	Ah, my family. We're what you'd probably call "not lucky". My whole family is kind of marked by tragedy, bad luck and general... shittiness. It goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it, so I'll keep it simple. My mom died when I was six. Cancer.
M	JENNIFER	Sad.
F	MARK	And my dad got real depressed and lost his job. Out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime.
M	JENNIFER	What kind of crime?
F	MARK	He was a robber. Houses mostly.
M	MARK'S DAD (O.S.)	Hi, I'm calling to let you know I'll be robbing your house today. I'll probably be there within the hour. I hope you're not there.
F	MARK	He was a very unlucky man. He spent his last days behind bars. I never really knew him. But I guess I've also had a little luck in my life. I did have a wonderful grandmother who raised me.
M	JENNIFER	Oh, that's sweet.
F	MARK	Yeah, she's great.
M	JENNIFER	Where is she?
F	MARK	Old person's home obviously. Who wants to live with that? Gross.
M	JENNIFER	I know, right?
F	MARK	But I'm going to get her out of there tomorrow. I'm going to buy her a big beautiful mansion where she can spend her few remaining days in luxury.
M	JENNIFER	That's nice.
M	WAITER	I don't know what's wrong with the chef today, but these just look awful.
F	MARK	They look fine to me.
M	WAITER	Well, you're stupid.
F	MARK	Right. I was thinking that since I'm going to be rich and successful now that I might be in your league. And that maybe we could be together. Romantically.
M	JENNIFER	What would be the point?
F	MARK	Well, I don't know, maybe we might enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good together and could have a happy life, raise a family together.
M	JENNIFER	Well, I do like you. And I enjoy your company. And if we were to get together and procreate I would like the offspring that are carrying half my genetic code to be well taken care of and financially stable. I also think you'd make a good father and a good husband, which I like.
F	MARK	Good. Fantastic.
M	JENNIFER	Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact that you'd still be contributing half of the genetic code to our children. I don't want short, fat kids with little snub noses.
F	MARK	Sure.
M	MARK (ON PHONE)	Hello? What?
M	MARK (ON PHONE)	WHAT?
F	MARK	Grandma, they just called me. What's going on? Are you okay?
F	MARTHA	I don't know, I fell on my way back to my room.
F	MARK	What do the doctors say?
F	MARTHA	They say I'll probably die tonight.
F	MARK	What?
M	DOCTOR	Oh, hello. I was just coming in to check on her, you must be Martha Bellison's grandson.
F	MARK	What are you talking about she's going to die?
M	DOCTOR	I'm sorry. It just doesn't look good. She's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak, her pulse not very strong, her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she'll have a fatal heart attack during the night.
F	MARK	Fuck.
M	DOCTOR	Yup, still going to die.
M	DOCTOR	I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt something for you two, but I really don't. I do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering. On a side note, it's fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs. You might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies.
F	MARTHA	I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want to die. You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. One minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone. This is it Mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness.
F	MARK	Grandma!
M	NURSE #1	She's seizing.
F	MARTHA	I'm scared.
F	MARK	Listen closely to me, Grandma. I have a surprise for you.
F	MARK	You're wrong about what happens when you die. It's not an eternity of nothingness.
F	MARK	When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. And you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. And you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. There will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. And it will last for an eternity, Grandma. An eternity.
M	NURSE #1	Go on.
M	DOCTOR	What else happens?
F	MARK	Do your jobs!
F	MARK	You're going to be happy forever, grandma. I promise you. Say hello to my mom for me. Tell her I love her.
M	NURSE #2	I'm going to see my mother again when I die.
M	DOCTOR	Tell us more, please.
F	MARK	Damn it.
M	JENNIFER	I'm so sorry, Mark.
F	MARK	I think I just did something bad.
M	JENNIFER	Do you want to come inside?
M	JENNIFER	Hi.
F	MARK	Hi. There he is! Is there only one place you go when you die?
M	PERSON #2	Will everyone who has ever died be there? What's this place called?
M	PERSON #4	Will I get to have sex with people there? You owe us an explanation. If you know something this important, you better tell us all.
F	MARK	Who are you people? The words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire. Please, tell us more. Explain what you said.
F	MARK	Fine, fine, just give me a minute.
M	JENNIFER (V.O.)	You've been gone for twenty minutes and I turn on the T.V to see you on every station. What's going on? This is seriously the weirdest thing...
F	MARK	Remember last night when I said I think I did something bad? Well now I know I did something bad.
M	JENNIFER	They're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die.
F	MARK	Hold on.
M	REPORTER (ON T.V)	Twenty-four hours ago, Mark Bellison was just your typical nobody writer.
M	REPORTER (ON T.V) (cont'd)	Today, people are saying he knows new information about what happens after you die.
F	MARK	Fuck.
M	JENNIFER	Mark, what do you know? What did you tell your grandmother last night? What's going on?
F	MARK	I can't explain it all right now. Why don't you come over?
M	JENNIFER	Okay.
F	MARK	Come up quick, they look like they could get out of hand any second.
M	JENNIFER	Just tell me what you told your grandmother.
F	MARK	I don't think I should. Who knows what could happen next? I'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on.
M	JENNIFER	What you said obviously affected a lot of people. I don't think you have the choice to keep it in now.
F	MARK	Sure I do. I could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to Namibia. No one knows me in Namibia.
M	JENNIFER	Just tell me what you said. Please, Mark.
F	MARK	My grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over. She didn't want to just become nothingness. So I told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness. That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness.
M	JENNIFER	How do you know these things?
M	JENNIFER	You have to tell them everything you know. This is too big. You have no choice.
F	MARK	But you don't understand. The words I said... they weren't... it's not right.
M	JENNIFER	How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things?
F	MARK	Happy. At peace.
M	JENNIFER	And how did that make you feel?
F	MARK	Good.
M	JENNIFER	Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people.
F	MARK	Okay. But I need a few hours to get my thoughts together.
M	JENNIFER	I'll go tell them.
F	MARK	Wait! Are you sure this is right?
M	JENNIFER	Of course it is. You know something that's going to change mankind forever. It's the most important thing the world has ever heard.
M	GREG	I brought pizza. How come you never told me we all get mansions?
F	MARK	I didn't...
M	GREG	Inventing the bicycle is one thing, but this...
M	JENNIFER	Shut up. Let him work.
M	NEWSCASTER (ON T.V)	In Seoul Korea, they wait. In Rome, Italy, they wait. In London, England, they wait. In New York City, they wait. The world has come to a standstill, everyone at their televisions and radios, or here on this lawn, waiting for Mark Bellison to come forth and tell the people what he knows.
F	MARK	I'm done.
M	JENNIFER	Are you ready?
F	MARK	I guess.
F	MARK	I feel like I should be reading these off of something other than just notebook paper. I wish they were like, written on large tablets or even just nicer paper or something.
F	MARK	Feels better.
M	JENNIFER	Just tell them what you know
M	GREG	Good luck out there, man.
M	YOUNG MAN	I heard that he said we all get mansions, and that there's even ponies.
M	NEWSCASTER	Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These are the things we can all expect when we die. What else can we expect? We won't know until Mark Bellison steps out of that...
M	YOUNG MAN	THERE HE IS!
F	MARK	Hello.
F	MARK	Oh, thanks.
F	MARK	Wow.
F	MARK	So. I guess you've all heard the things I told my grandmother last night and... I understand why you're here. I know... some things. Some very important things. And I'm going to share these things with you now.
F	MARK	Everything you want to know is written here. On this old pizza box.
F	MARK	Number one: There is a man who lives in the sky who controls everything. Number two...
M	MAN #1	Whoa, whoa whoa. What does he look like? Tall. Big hands. A good head of hair.
M	WOMAN #1	What ethnicity is he?
F	MARK	He's a new ethnicity. It's like a mix of all of our ethnicities.
M	MAN #2	Does he live on a cloud?
M	MAN #3	Can we see him?
F	MARK	No. He lives much higher than the clouds, too high to see.
M	WOMAN #2	So he lives in space?
F	MARK	No, not that high.
M	MAN #3	So you mean the Thermosphere?
F	MARK	Look, people I got a lot to get through here. I'm just telling you what I know: Man. Lives in the sky. You can't see him. Controls everything. Cool?
F	MARK	Number two: When you die you don't disappear into an eternity of nothingness. Instead, you go to a really great place. Number three: In that place every person will get a mansion. What kind of mansion?
F	MARK	I don't know. Whatever kind of mansion you're thinking of right now.
M	WOMAN #3	Oh no! I wasn't thinking of a mansion!
M	MAN #5	Shit! I was thinking of a horrible mansion!
F	MARK	Look, it's the best mansion you can think of, not just now, but ever. Whatever the best mansion for you can possibly be, that's the one you'll get. Number four: When you die, all the people you love will be there too.
M	MAN #6	Will they have their own mansions?
F	MARK	Yes, of course. Everyone gets a mansion.
M	MAN #6	What if I want them to live in my mansion?
F	MARK	If they want to live with you, they can leave their mansion and live in yours. What happens to their mansion?
F	MARK	I don't know, it goes back on the market.
M	WOMAN #4	What about the people I hate? Will they be there too?
F	MARK	No. Where are they?
F	MARK	Okay, they're probably there, but you'll never see them. They're far off, too far for you to get there. But what if they try to find me?
F	MARK	They won't. They hate you too.
M	WOMAN #4	But what if they don't? What if they love me but I hate them?
F	MARK	Well then you're just... you'll both be fine with it. There's only love there, okay? Number five: When you die there will be free ice cream. All day. All night. Whatever flavor you can think of.
M	WOMAN #5	What, even bad flavors?
F	MARK	But why would you eat bad flavors?
M	WOMAN #5	Well, you just said every flavor I can think of.
M	MAN #8	Oh no, I just thought about vanilla and skunks!
F	MARK	Well don't eat it then!
M	WOMAN #6	I've just thought the chocolate sauce is diarrhea!
F	MARK	Well don't put it on then! What's wrong with you people? I mean... Number six: If you do bad things you won't get to go to this great place when you die.
M	MAN #9	Where will you go?
F	MARK	A terrible place. The worst place imaginable.
M	WOMAN #7	What constitutes a bad thing?
F	MARK	Murder. Crime. Rape. Things like that.
M	WOMAN #7	You have to tell us all the things or else we might do them and it wouldn't be our fault!
F	MARK	Fine.
M	MAN #9	Is punching someone bad?
F	MARK	Yes.
M	MAN #9	What if they're trying to hurt you?
F	MARK	Then it's fine.
M	WOMAN #7	Is cursing bad?
F	MARK	No.
M	WOMAN #1	What about being late for work?
F	MARK	That's fine too. I mean, you might lose your job if your boss doesn't like it, but it won't effect what happens after you die. What about if you forget to feed your dog?
F	MARK	That also is fine. Unless the dog dies. Then it's bad.
M	MAN #1	If you do just one bad thing do you go to the bad place?
F	MARK	No. You get... ... three chances. If you do three bad things you're out.
M	MAN #1	Like baseball!
F	MARK	Kind of, yes.
F	MARK	Any more?
F	MARK	Look, can we just move on?
M	MAN #2	No! We have to know everything that's bad!
F	MARK	Fine. Let's start with you... Is it bad to wear pants?
F	MARK	No. There's no hairstyle that will put you in the bad place. Like I've told you, the main things are hurting people physically on purpose, taking people's stuff, doing things to people they don't want done, killing people on purpose. Okay? Are we good?
M	CRYING MAN	I've done many of those bad things. Is there anything I can do to not go to the bad place? Help me, I'm so scared.
F	MARK	Well, you didn't know about these bad things until I told you just now so you're fine. Am I fine?
M	WOMAN #5	What about me?
F	MARK	You're all fine! I'm only talking about people who do bad things starting right now. Everyone else is fine. Number seven: The man in the sky who controls everything decides if you go to the good place or the bad place. He also decides who lives and who dies.
M	MAN #4	Does he cause natural disasters?
F	MARK	Yes.
M	WOMAN #3	Did he cause my mom to get cancer?
F	MARK	Yes. Did he cause that tree to land on my car last week?
F	MARK	Yes.
M	BLUE COLLAR GUY	I say fuck the guy that lives in the sky!
M	MAN #5	Yeah! That guy's a fucking asshole!
M	WOMAN #5	That motherfucker better hope I never see him face to face!
M	MAN #6	That guy's a fucking coward! Hiding up there and doing bad shit to us! Why doesn't he do it to our faces?
M	WOMAN #6	We need to stop that motherfucker before he kills us all!
F	MARK	WAIT!
F	MARK	This guy who lives in the sky and controls everything is also responsible for all the good stuff that happens.
M	MAN #7	He's the guy who saved my life on that fishing trip when the boat capsized?
F	MARK	Yup.
M	MAN #7	Did he capsize the boat?
F	MARK	Well, yes.
M	WOMAN #7	He's the one who killed my grandmother and left me those millions of dollars?
F	MARK	You betcha.
M	WOMAN #3	So is he the same one who cured my mom's cancer?
F	MARK	That too.
M	MAN #8	So he's kind of a good guy, but he's also kind of a prick too?
F	MARK	Right. But check this out: Number eight: Even if the man in the sky does bad shit to you, he makes it up to you by giving you an eternity of good stuff after you die.
M	WOMAN #1	As long as you don't do any of the bad stuff you listed, right?
F	MARK	Right. Of course.
M	WOMAN #2	So it's kind of a test?
F	MARK	Yes. Right. Well, that's it. That's everything I know.
M	NURSE #1	How do you know these things?
F	MARK	The man in the clouds told me.
M	NURSE #1	Yeah, but how come we're just learning these things now, millions of years into our existence?
F	MARK	I don't know, he forgot or something. I gotta go people, good night!
F	MARK	You think that went well?
F	MARK	So then the flying duck flew all the way to Alaska where it met up with a polar bear who could talk. And the polar bear's name was Martin. And the polar bear was wearing a green cape. And Martin and the flying duck both had race cars with their names printed on the side and...
M	JENNIFER	I just saw three people climbing the fence into your backyard. You really need to think about getting better security. Mark, how many of those have you had?
F	MARK	But then the evil goblin witch came in and stole the flying duck's race car and made the flying duck very angry. Luckily the Polar Bear was there to snatch the race car back... Unfortunately, the witch was a smart witch and the polar bear was powerless.
M	ASSISTANT	Is that the end?
F	MARK	Yeah.
M	ASSISTANT	That's a strange ending.
F	MARK	Hey, don't look at me: it's the Man in the Sky's story.
M	ASSISTANT	You want me to take this over to Lecture Films?
F	MARK	Yeah. Tell them to shoot that one this week.
F	MARK	Tell them it's for kids!
F	MARK	What?
M	JENNIFER	You haven't left the house in weeks. Every time I come by you're just sitting here writing down stories you get from the Man in the Sky.
F	MARK	Hey, he's the boss.
M	JENNIFER	Don't you think you should go outside sometime? You know there's about five thousand people on our lawn waiting to ask you questions.
F	MARK	Yeah, yeah.
M	JENNIFER	What's with you? You seem sad.
M	JENNIFER	I don't get it. You're a very successful writer, you've won countless awards and Oscars...
M	JENNIFER	You've changed the way people see the world, the way they see death and life. You've made the entire world happy.
F	MARK	Not the entire world.
M	JENNIFER	I know. Not you. The one person who should be happy, the person who has everything...
F	MARK	Not everything.
M	JENNIFER	What else do you want?
F	MARK	I'd trade it all in for you. All of it.
M	JENNIFER	Well, you've got me. As a friend.
F	MARK	Yeah. That's important. But why can't we be together. Why can't you be with me?
M	JENNIFER	Because of the whole snub nosed thing. With kids, your genetics. You know, fat, short...
F	MARK	Yeah. Okay. Yup. It's almost a shame that being rich and powerful and famous doesn't change your genetics.
M	JENNIFER	What?
F	MARK	It would be great if it changed your genetic material because I really love you but I just don't...
F	MARK	It does change your genetics.
M	JENNIFER	Does it?
F	MARK	No. No, it doesn't. Our kids would be short and fat with little snub noses.
M	JENNIFER	Right. Too bad. Anyway, I've come to tell you I can't go to the movies with you tonight.
F	MARK	Why not?
M	JENNIFER	I've got a date.
F	MARK	What? With who?
M	JENNIFER	Rob Marlowe.
F	MARK	You've got to be fucking... Rob Marlowe?!? He's a complete and total asshole.
M	JENNIFER	Not to me. He's very sweet and kind to me.
F	MARK	Well of course he is, look at you. I mean, for fuck's sake, a shark would be nice to you...
M	JENNIFER	It would?
F	MARK	Well no, I mean... Don't go out with him.
M	JENNIFER	Why not? He's a great match for me.
F	MARK	What's he got that I don't?
M	JENNIFER	We talked about this. If you and I got together it wouldn't be fair to our kids. They have the right to be attractive and have good genes. If Rob and I get married You can move into our mansion with us when we all die.
F	MARK	I don't want to move into your fucking mansion. And what are you doing thinking about marriage with him already? You haven't even gone on one date.
F	MARK	It's like nothing's changed.
M	JENNIFER	A lot of things have changed. I wish you could be happy.
M	JENNIFER	That's him. Gotta go.
F	MARK	He's picking you up here?
M	JENNIFER	It was his idea.
M	ROB	What's up? Wow, I can't wait to have sex with you.
M	ROB	Oh hey there, Mark. You look like trash. Come on Jennifer, let's go have some fun. And then have some sex.
M	JENNIFER	I'll call you tomorrow.
M	GREG	Who was that?
F	MARK	Hey, watch this. HEY PEOPLE!
F	MARK	The man in the sky just told me something!
F	MARK	You're all gay!
F	MARK	And adopted!
M	GREG	I don't know why we're laughing. It's really probably very sad for those people.
F	MARK	I'm gettin' a beer.
F	MARK	Out of beer. Just Coke.
F	MARK	I want to do something big again. Like telling the people what happens when they die. That felt good. I gotta do something big like that again.
M	GREG	Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell you something new.
F	MARK	Maybe.
M	GREG	Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I really shouldn't drink this.
F	MARK	Hey, Greg. What if I told you that drinking Coke was good for you?
F	MARK	And not just Coke. But all the delicious foods you're not supposed to eat. What if they were all of a sudden really, really good for you?
M	GREG	It would be the happiest day of my life.
F	MARK	Gentleman, thank you all for coming here on such short notice. I have some very big news for you all today. Is it from the Man in the Sky?
F	MARK	Nope, this one I came up with all on my own. And it's going to change the way you all do business... forever.
F	MARK	Up until now, all products sold worldwide have warning labels printed on them. Warnings like these.
F	MARK	As you can see, a lot of these products can be very depressing. They remind people of all the horrible things that can happen to them in life. People hate thinking about horrible things.
M	EXECUTIVE #2	Yeah, but they have to know those things. They have to be able to protect themselves. I don't want to hurt anyone. Especially now that I know about the "bad place".
F	MARK	Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to introduce you to the future of your companies.
M	EXECUTIVE #3	Where can I get some of that healthy coke?
F	MARK	It's the same Coke as before.
M	EXECUTIVE #4	But this one is healthy! And it tastes great!
M	EXECUTIVE #1	Do you have any samples?
F	MARK	Guys, it's the same Coke on the inside. I've just changed the outside. Somehow by changing the outside, he's also changed the inside!
M	EXECUTIVE #2	Oh, thank goodness. I've always hated flying! Me too! What an invention! How did you do it?
F	MARK	I didn't do anything, guys. I made this on my computer last night. The plane is exactly the same as it was before. That's the only plane I'll ever fly on again!
F	MARK	That's the point here guys. With these new advertising strategies, people will buy your products with abandon.
M	EXECUTIVE #2	But it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products you've invented.
F	MARK	No. It won't. All you have to do is print these words on the packaging. That's it.
F	MARK	Even if you don't understand it, just start shipping these products out to people as you see them here and you're all going to get very, very rich. How did you do it?
F	MARK	Look, they're still the same products you have on the shelves right now. The only difference now is that people won't get bummed out or scared when they use them. Isn't that a good thing?
F	MARK	Gentleman, if you'll excuse me, I have five thousand gay orphans on my front lawn that are going bananas.
M	FAT MAN	Thank the Man in the Sky for this. I've never been happier in my life. Now I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want.
M	REPORTER	Are you all right, sir?
M	FAT MAN	Yeah. I must just be real happy. It says on the wrapper that they help boost your happiness.
F	MARK	You should slow down there, Greg.
M	GREG	Why's that?
F	MARK	Just because the package says it's not bad for you doesn't mean you have to gorge yourself on it.
M	GREG	But it tastes so good.
F	MARK	That's just stupid.
M	GREG	No it's not.
M	GREG	See?
M	GREG	You look sad. Here, have a brownie. They'll cheer you up.
F	MARK	I wish that worked for me, Greg.
M	GREG	What?
F	MARK	Nevermind. I'll see you around.
M	BUSINESS MAN	I'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. But from a distance I look very important and busy.
M	GIRLFRIEND	No, I won't move into your mansion with you when we die. You're really smothering me.
M	BOYFRIEND	The more you push me away, the more attracted I am to you.
M	HONKING MAN	Move it, fatty!
M	HONKING MAN	Hey you're Mark Bellison!
F	MARK	Yeah. So are you going to apologize?
M	HONKING MAN	For what?
F	MARK	Nothing's really changed. I gave people the Man in the Sky, made myself rich and successful, told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it. Everyone's happy but me. Because I'm the only one who knows it all... isn't. I made it all up. You're not up there living in a mansion. You're right here. In the ground. That's all. And I'm the only one who knows that. And the one thing I want I can't have. Because the world is too stupid to change. The world only cares about what they can see, and what they can know, and what they're used to and what... makes sense. No one listens to what they really want. And that's why I'll always just be a loser, grandma. And that's why I'll always be alone.
F	MARK	Who's there?
M	JENNIFER (O.S.)	It's me. Can I come in?
F	MARK	Sure.
F	MARK	Haven't seen you much lately.
M	JENNIFER	I know. I've been busy with work and things. And I'm getting married. That's why I came over. To tell you.
F	MARK	Don't do it.
M	JENNIFER	The wedding is tomorrow.
M	JENNIFER	I hope you'll come.
F	MARK	No point really.
M	JENNIFER	It would make me happy. Being around you makes me happy.
F	MARK	So don't marry him.
M	JENNIFER	I only have a few years to marry someone with good genes and financial stability so I can have children and the family I've always wanted. One day I'll be old and wrinkly and ugly.
F	MARK	No you won't. Not to me you won't. I love you. If you really love someone it doesn't matter what they look like.
M	JENNIFER	What do you mean?
F	MARK	Do me this favor. Just one favor. Don't accept everything you see. Don't just do something because that's the way it's done.
M	JENNIFER	You're confusing me.
F	MARK	Think about what you want. Find out what you really want. And if it's not the same as what I want, well then I'll know that and I'll never darken your doorstep again. I want you. What do you want?
M	JENNIFER	I'm going to go.
F	MARK	Please don't. Will you just stay a little bit longer? I don't want to be alone. Just sit with me.
M	JENNIFER	My invention.
M	GREG	We're gonna be late.
M	GREG	Makes sense people would start getting married at these places. I mean, who you marry decides who's mansion you're going to live in one day. It's a big decision.
F	MARK	Yeah.
M	JENNIFER'S MOTHER	It's time, dear.
M	JENNIFER'S MOTHER	Jennifer?
M	JENNIFER	I don't feel all right.
M	JENNIFER'S MOTHER	What's wrong? Do you have food poisoning?
M	JENNIFER	No. I don't think there's a word for what I have.
M	WEDDING OVERSEER	We are sitting here in this building today to share in the wedding of Rob and Jennifer. Two young, attractive people who have agreed that this union would be mutually beneficial and that their genetic match-up would most likely produce favorable offspring and a life of financial stability and physical security.
M	WEDDING OVERSEER	Rob, do you promise to stay with Jennifer for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can?
M	ROB	I do.
M	WEDDING OVERSEER	Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can?
M	WEDDING OVERSEER	Jennifer?
M	JENNIFER	I'm sorry, hold on one second. Rob, can I ask you something?
M	ROB	Sure. But what are you doing?
M	JENNIFER	What color are my eyes? I dunno... Oh, they're brown.
M	JENNIFER	No Rob, they're blue.
M	ROB	Oh, look at that. So they are. You've got pretty blue eyes.
M	ROB	Can we get on with this?
M	WEDDING OVERSEER	Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can?
M	JENNIFER	I do.
M	WEDDING OVERSEER	Before I pronounce these two man and wife, is there anyone here who thinks they'd offer either of these people a better genetic match-up?
F	MARK	Me.
M	ROB	Oh come on. Look at you. You can't be better.
F	MARK	Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes.
M	ROB	Schmuck genes? What's that?
F	MARK	And I love her. Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this what you really want?
M	JENNIFER	I don't know. Yes?
F	MARK	All right. I'm done. Goodbye.
M	ROB	Are we married yet? Because I've got plans this afternoon.
M	JENNIFER	Hold on a minute!
F	MARK	What?
M	JENNIFER	I'm confused.
F	MARK	So am I.
M	JENNIFER	Is any of it... the things you said... are they... I can't think of the word. Is there a Man in the Sky?
F	MARK	No.
M	JENNIFER	Why'd you say there was?
F	MARK	Because I couldn't cope with the look on my grandmother's face.
M	JENNIFER	But how could you say something that... wasn't.
F	MARK	I'm not sure. I just did it.
M	JENNIFER	And what did you mean that I could grow old and ugly and still be beautiful to you?
F	MARK	I mean just that. You'll always be beautiful to me.
M	JENNIFER	But what if my looks...
F	MARK	It doesn't matter.
M	JENNIFER	I feel funny.
F	MARK	Me too. Everything is so hard. Nothing is easy anymore. I know what I want.
F	MARK	What?
M	JENNIFER	I want short, fat kids with little snub noses.
F	MARK	Easy! That's an easy one.
M	JENNIFER	Does anyone else know about your invention?
F	MARK	No. But I'm sure it won't be long.
M	JENNIFER	Should we tell them right away?
F	MARK	I'm not sure. I don't think everyone will understand.
M	GREG	What's going on out here? Everyone's just sitting in there. Are we gonna finish this wedding?
M	JENNIFER	Yes.
F	MARK	Praise the Man in the Sky.
M	NARRATOR	The world's last moment of honesty. A monumental occasion in the history of mankind. That lowly writer who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become one of the most important men of his age, married to one of the most beautiful women of his time, and passed on the lying gene to generations to come. A world without honesty is a world with dreams. A world with pretense. A world with fiction. A world with flattery. And most importantly, a world with true love. Put simply, a world very much like our own.
