M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	TED	Good morning. Annie pretends to wake up.
M	TED (CONT'D)	Wow, you look beautiful. What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the morning. I look terrible. I just woke up.
M	TED	Last night was fun.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever... She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her
M	TED	So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want to be up front with you. I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him,
F	ANNIE	Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?
M	TED	I just want to be honest right off the bat.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. Annie struggles to maintain her composure.
M	TED	I'm just so busy and I don't have time for another person...I...
F	ANNIE	Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy--
M	TED	And summer's coming--
F	ANNIE	Yeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy season. So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--?
M	TED	Yeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall--
F	ANNIE	You shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween--
M	TED	I'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.
F	ANNIE	Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awayâcause I'm doing really well at work.
M	TED	And honestly, (sits up) I don't even know how I feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people.
F	ANNIE	It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's science. I'm-I don't want a relationship either. Let's just say that. And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls.
M	TED	Yeah. Well anyway, I really should get going. I was gonna get a haircut today.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.
M	TED	Well, like I said I got stuff to do. Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy...
M	TED HOLLY	Cool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib.. late. Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into...
M	TED	Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.
F	ANNIE	Oh, no problem. Made from scratch.
M	TED	Sometimes it sticks!
F	ANNIE	No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie exits.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Byyyyee!
F	ANNIE	Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.
F	LILLIAN	It's summer?! What the hell does that mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?
F	ANNIE	I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid now.
F	LILLIAN	No he's stupid Ann, not you.
F	ANNIE	I think I might be a little bit stupid.
F	LILLIAN	Ew. Did you have sex with him?
F	ANNIE	No! But I gave him a blow job.
F	LILLIAN	What?!
F	ANNIE	Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a
F	LILLIAN	Well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him.
M	DOUGIE	Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at all this sweat.
F	LILLIAN	Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm talking to Annie.
M	DOUGIE	Hey Annie.
F	LILLIAN	Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for women you know?
M	DOUGIE	Shit. Really?!
F	LILLIAN	It's not gonna do anything to you.
M	DOUGIE	Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger. He tries to rub up against Lillian.
F	LILLIAN	Ew, go take a shower. Dougie leaves.
M	DOUGIE (O.S.)	I'm gonna play with my new boobs in there.
F	LILLIAN	I swear I cannot handle him right now. He has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like I'm kissing my brother. I don't know what do. Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY
F	ANNIE	At least you have someone. God, wha's wrong with me?
F	LILLIAN	There's nothing wrong with you. But I think maybe, and don't get mad at me, I've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard.
F	ANNIE	I still don't think I do that.
F	LILLIAN	OK, so you had a first date last night. Did you bring him a present? Annie is silent. Ann, what did I tell you?
F	ANNIE	I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're right, that's weird.
M	DOUGIE (O.S.)	Shit!
F	LILLIAN	What?! I just chipped a nail!
F	LILLIAN	Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but I wanna kill him.
F	ANNIE	Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist. Lillian laughs.
F	LILLIAN	Oh my God. We need to hang out. 'm coming to Milwaukee this weekend.
F	ANNIE	Are you serious?
F	LILLIAN	We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll bring some shitty magazines, and I'm gonna spend the night.
F	ANNIE	God, I haven't seen you in months!
F	LILLIAN	I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her
M	DOUGIE	Baby, I'm going through some changes...
F	LILLIAN	We see she gets a kick out of him.
F	ANNIE	Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.
M	DONNA	Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle. Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.
M	DONNA (CONT'D)	terrible has happened. Donald will not be coming in to work today. He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling. Employees mumble.
M	DONNA (CONT'D)	Annie? Where's your tie? Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment that I can't change or they'll will charge me. So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings. Now I-- Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the Sandy? Today's your day.
M	SANDY	Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie.
M	DONNA	Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. You think you can handle it? Yeah, look out. There might be a bum- rush for letter openers... The employees snicker.
F	ANNIE	Sometimes there is, so....there have been. At times, there has been.
M	DONNA	Alright everybody, let's get to work! Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks
F	ANNIE	Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really-
M	DONNA	Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting?
F	ANNIE	Five?
M	DONNA	I just made all of that up. None of that was real. I just put words together. You're not ready for the big leagues. Understand?
F	ANNIE	It's so hard to make commission over there.
M	DONNA	Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?
F	ANNIE	Many times.
M	DONNA	She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
F	ANNIE	Okay. (beat) I do want it.
M	DONNA	wonderful place to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.
M	DONNA (CONT'D)	Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal. It's reckless! Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section.
F	ANNIE	Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.
M	T.V. HOST	When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic. I've never seen so many cupboards!
M	STEVE	Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart. Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over? As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going to bed?
F	ANNIE	Yes. I'm beat.
M	STEVE	Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away.
F	ANNIE	Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her.
M	STEVE	That credit lady called! She wants to talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..
M	ALLEN (ON SHOW)	This is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing. We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading room.
M	STEVE	Gross/Amazing.
F	ANNIE	You're right. God, she's getting really skinny.
F	LILLIAN	Ann.
F	ANNIE	What?
F	LILLIAN	(quietly) Your boyfriend just walked in. REVEAL: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE arms and
F	ANNIE	Oh my God! Look, he showed up with your mom. It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.
F	LILLIAN	Here Annie, let me turn the page for you.
F	ANNIE	What? Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a
F	LILLIAN	the page of your magazine for you...
F	ANNIE	Lillian! What is that?!
F	LILLIAN	I'm engaged.
F	ANNIE	What?!!
F	LILLIAN	He proposed at dinner last night. I wanted to tell you in person and show you this rock!
F	ANNIE	It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this is...this is crazy!
F	LILLIAN	I know Dougie and I have been fighting a lot, but I've been so stressed out with
F	ANNIE	That's not I mean. I mean, I remember when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember?
F	LILLIAN	Oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake?
F	ANNIE	No, I don't. It's just making me realize how long we've known each other.
F	LILLIAN	Well then, who better to be my Maid of Honor?
F	ANNIE	Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
F	LILLIAN	Annie, you're my best friend. Honestly I didn't even have to think about it.
F	ANNIE	Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God. I've never been in a wedding.
F	LILLIAN	It's no big deal, and I don't want to make it one. It's not gonna be a big crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple. (beat) What dessert are you gonna get?
F	ANNIE	I know what you're doing. Don't downplay this. I'm happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about you. OK? This is you're day, and it is a big deal.
F	LILLIAN	Ok, but I still don't want this to be a huge production. I just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever.
F	ANNIE	Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys set a date?
F	LILLIAN	Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
F	ANNIE	Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
F	LILLIAN	(mocking) Can you hold that thought. I's my fiancee calling. Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.
F	ANNIE	Ooo, haha... Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing outside eating
M	YOUNG ANNIE	Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your husband, forever, to be your husband? Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.
M	YOUNG LILLIAN	I do. Do you Annie Lucille Walker, take your husband, forever? Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of John Baker from
F	ANNIE	I do.
F	LILLIAN	And now we will leave on our honeymoon to...
M	SEA WORLD!!	The girls rip the posters off of the trees. An old station wagon sits in the dirt driveway. They get
M	'S	thought.
F	LILLIAN	The madness has begun. Dougie's parents are having an engagement party for us next Friday.
F	ANNIE	Awesome!...
F	ANNIE	She finds the article. âHurry, before he gets away! Top
M	MAN (O.S)	Excuse me. A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching remembers the magazine! It reads â#1. A simple, flirty working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it,
F	ANNIE	Hello?
M	HELEN (ON PHONE)	Annie!?
F	ANNIE	Yes? It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend
F	HELEN	Hi.
F	ANNIE	Hi.
F	HELEN	Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of Lillian's bridesmaids.
F	ANNIE	Of course, Helen. Hi!
F	HELEN	Congratulations on being selected.
F	ANNIE	Oh, thank you. Annie, reads â#2. Expose your best asset. ASAPâ She
F	HELEN	Annie?
F	ANNIE	Sorry, yes. Hi!
F	HELEN	Maid of Honor!!
F	ANNIE	Yeah. It is quite an honor.
F	HELEN	It's the number one spot. So how many times have you been in the B.P?
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry, the what?
F	HELEN	Bridal Party?
F	ANNIE	I've never even been in a wedding before.
F	HELEN	What!? I've never even heard of that.
F	ANNIE	Um, well, it should be fun. Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his
M	Â SHE	and the golden retriever meet eyes.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Um Helen, can you hold on for a second? Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy.
F	ANNIE	Hey, you're dog's really cute.
M	MAN	Oh thanks.
F	ANNIE	It's kinda funny right? That when girls are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	(beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly girls. But I'm not friends with them. I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone.
M	HELEN'S VOICE	Hello?!
F	ANNIE	Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited for all the wedding stuff and--
F	HELEN	YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from Lilly with all of the other girls' information, and when you respond to any wedding related e-mails from now on, just remember to hit âREPLY ALLâ. Did you know there are six of us?
F	ANNIE	Yeah, Lillian told me last night. Awkward silence.
F	HELEN	Well, can't wait to meet you and hear what your planning for the bachelorette. Any ideas?
F	ANNIE	Not yet. But they are coming, and I will fill you in--
F	HELEN	Oop! There goes my other line. See you Friday! She realizes there might some research to do for this âbridal party' thing. She instead grabs two wedding
F	ANNIE	Just these. Noticing a magazine by the register that reads â(some bad And this. She presses âprint', then notices it's 120 pages long.
F	ANNIE	Whoa. Email DING. She checks her inbox. 48 NEW MESSAGES. Ratesâ,âShoesâ,âShower themesâ âDoes anyone have...â,âCute Favor Ideasâ,âFitness programâ,âLingerie?â
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Oh my God.
F	ANNIE	He probably didn't see you, Mom.
M	JUDY	Oh, he saw me alright. He was married to me for fourteen years, he knows what I look like. I'm sure it was because BARB was there. You know how jealous she gets.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, I'm sure that's it mom.
M	JUDY	Am I on speaker phone?
F	ANNIE	Yeah.
M	JUDY	I don't know how to talk this way.
F	ANNIE	Mom I'm running a little late so--
M	JUDY	Oh, the engagement party. Lillia's getting married, I can't believe how time flies. You're day will come dear. Give Lillian a kiss for me please, and tell Laurie and Ed I just could't afford the plane ticket, but I will be at the shower.
F	ANNIE	I already told them, they understand.
M	JUDY	BARB could afford to come. Did you know what kind of car she drives now? A 2007 P.T. Cruiser. She looks ridiculous parading all around Fort Myers in that thing.
F	ANNIE	Ok, Mom--
M	JUDY	I don't know how she gets in and out of that little car with those big legs.
F	ANNIE	I should get going. I have long drive.
M	JUDY	Oh and honey, I picked you up a couple of things when I was at the Steinmart with Janice so look for a package in the mail.
F	ANNIE	Mom I told you you don't have to send me--
M	JUDY	Oh stop. I love doing it. Ok? I love you sweetie.
F	ANNIE	I love you too Mom. Bye. They hang up. Annie walks to the kitchen.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Ok, how do I look?
M	STEVE	Ooooh. You tryin to hook up tonight? A lot of people do at these wedding things you know so you have a good chance.
F	ANNIE	Nevermind...
M	STEVE	I like the black tights with the black shoes, it's very elongating.
F	ANNIE	Oh. Well, thank you.
M	STEVE	But I think you need more dark up top to balance it out, do have any black beads?
F	ANNIE	good idea. She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	How many moonpies have you eaten? Tell me the truth.
M	STEVE	Um......two.
F	ANNIE	Ok, now really tell me the truth. How many did you eat?
M	STEVE	Four. Nine. They stare at each other.
F	ANNIE	Shit! She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum.
M	RHODES	get out of the city?
F	ANNIE	No. Was I speeding?
M	RHODES	Is that even possible in this rig? He finds this funny, Annie does't.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	You know funny thing about brake lights, you're supposed to have âem.
F	ANNIE	Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out.
M	RHODES	Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches Curve. That's a risky move.
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year.
M	RHODES	Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That is not something you wanna go broadcasting to a police officer. I might feel obligated to give you a yea's worth of tickets now.
F	ANNIE	What? No.. I-
M	RHODES	You just admitted it.
F	ANNIE	Can you do that?
M	RHODES	You admitted it. (beat) Yeah, I can't do that though.
F	ANNIE	Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will get the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really -
M	RHODES	Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a wedding. She lost some of her hair from the stress. Again, not funny.
F	ANNIE	Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep
M	RHODES	Uh, yeah. That's what happens when you break the law. Um...license and registration.
F	ANNIE	Here. He writes a ticket.
M	RHODES	(searching for words) Ooo, I like that air freshener. Did you get that at the gas station?
F	ANNIE	I don't remember.
M	RHODES	Smells like Christmas. (sniff) Yeah, it smells like Christmas. He rips the ticket off.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	Well, here you go. And just so you know it's a just a fix-it ticket. So if you get those lights repaired, you wo't have to pay anything.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Okay.
M	RHODES	Whoa, are those moon-pies?
F	ANNIE	Oh yeah.
M	RHODES	
F	ANNIE	What?
M	RHODES	Nothing. (mumbling) Those are my favorite.
F	ANNIE	Do you want one?
M	RHODES	No. It's too much trouble, they look all wrapped up. She doesn't get the hint. He really wants one.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	Well, have fun at your party. Annie drives off. He watches. Annie, a little embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet
M	LAURIE	Annie, sweetheart!
F	ANNIE	Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug.
M	LAURIE	Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies! Laurie takes the tray.
M	LAURIE (CONT'D)	Can you believe our Lillian?
F	ANNIE	I know, I'm so happy for her.
M	LAURIE	Well, clue me in. Is there anyone special in your life?
F	ANNIE	Nope.
M	LAURIE	That's my girl. (whisper) Sleep around. I'm serious. Travel the world and try all the cuisine you can. You know what I mean by that, right? MARY, Laurie's friend, approaches.
M	MARY	Laurie, where did you get that sweater? It is one-hundred percent out-of-sight!
M	LAURIE	Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay's.
M	MARY	Ooooh. I can't even walk in there. The blouses alone make my wallet open.
M	LAURIE	It's worth it, though huh? Mary, I want you to meet Lillian's Maid of Honor.
M	MARY	Oh, very special job.
M	LAURIE	This is Annie Walker. She lived next door to us in Milwaukee until the girls graduated from high school.
F	ANNIE	Hi. Ann!
F	ANNIE	Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary. Annie leaves.
M	LAURIE (TO MARY)	Her father ran off to Florida with a younger woman who was working at a Chrysler dealership.
M	MARY	Oh my.
M	LAURIE	Poor Judy, never quite got over it. She also ended up moving to Florida to take care of her parents.
M	MARY	Oh, that is tough. Well it's nice Annie and Lillian have stayed friends.
M	LAURIE	They're like sisters. They continue gabbing as Annie rushes to Lillian. They
F	LILLIAN	Hey!
F	ANNIE	Hey! What's up? Where's Dougie?
F	LILLIAN	Smoking a cigar with my dad. Le's go get a drink. They weave towards the bar.
M	DOUGIE	Annie!!!
F	LILLIAN	Hold on Dougie, we're getting drinks! They get to the bar and grab glasses of wine.
F	ANNIE	This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents belong here?
F	LILLIAN	Yeah. So does Dougie. This is the tennis club I've been playing at.
F	ANNIE	Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I pictured. Lucky you.
F	LILLIAN	Tennis courts are tennis courts if you ask me. But I have met a lot of really cool people here. I can't wait for you to meet the girls.
F	ANNIE	Oh! So where's this guy you were telling me about?
M	LILLIAN.	Oh shoot, Matt's not coming. I guess he got back together with his ex or something. Anyway, Dougie just told me. Sorry.
F	ANNIE	That's ok.
M	DOUGIE	There she is! Dougie picks Annie up and swings her around.
F	LILLIAN	Dougie, be careful. God, you reek! He puts her down.
M	DOUGIE	Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold feet you tell her what a great guy I am. He grabs Lillian and kisses her on the cheek.
F	LILLIAN	(waving the cigar scent away) Ugh. Wash your face. She gives in and kisses him. Then says to Annie..
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	Come on. Let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party. They approach LESLIE, Lillian's cousin, late 30's,
F	ANNIE	Leslie, hi! How are you guys?
M	LESLIE	Well, I just squeezed my third kid out last month and I feel like I'm walking around in a fat suit. She swigs beer out of a bottle.
M	PAUL	I keep telling her she looks great. (beat) Oh, I'm sorry. Is this your boyfriend? A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a neckbrace stands behind
F	ANNIE	No, no. (to the guy) Hi. (to them) No. Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie.
F	LILLIAN	Annie this is Dana, we met here in my tennis class. Dana, Annie.
M	DANA	Hi! Dana Shig. Its so nice to finally meet you Annie. I've heard so much about you. This is my husband Ernie. ERNIE has just put food in his mouth.
M	DANA (CONT'D)	Don't you just love weddings? I mean, (she starts to cry) I just love like the feeling and...everyone comes together you know? And it's forever! It's a journey, and WE get to go on it too!
F	ANNIE	Wow, that's beautiful. I never thought of it that way.
M	DANA	This is all so amazing. I'm going to make a scrap book for Lillian. Dana takes her camera out then reaches out her hand. Hi. I'm Dana and this is my husband Ernie. So...how did you two meet? She refers to a bald man who looks like a chemistry
F	ANNIE	No, I don't know him. He's not with me. He's just passing by. I'm not here with anyone. BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good
F	BECCA	Lil! Is this Annie?! Annie and Lillian walk over.
M	BECCA (CONT'D)	Hi Annie! I'm Becca. I've heard so much about you. This is my husband Kevin.
F	LILLIAN	Dougie's partner.
F	BECCA	So, are you so excited?! All of this reminds me so much of my wedding.
F	BECCA	Two months now! It was the best day of my life. I'm married now! It's like...I'm just better now! It might sound weird but... I feel legit. Just like, feminine. Look at my nails! Two beautifully french manicured hands with a HUGE 3

F	ANNIE	Megan! How are you?
F	MEGAN	I just got pins in my leg! I fell off a cruise ship.
F	ANNIE	Oh shit!
F	MEGAN	Yeah. I was on a singles cruise. It was nighttime.
M	MEGAN (CONT'D)	I was port-side, having a drink with a gentlemen and old Megan here decided to show off and I tried to climb into one of the lifeboats with my clogs on. I saw a dolphin.
F	ANNIE	Wow. Well, I'm glad you're OK.
F	MEGAN	Listen Annie. You're single right? You and I are gonna scam on guys this whole time. You and I are gonna party and get naked with guys. This whole time Annie, no bailing. Lillian re-appears, grabs Annie.
F	LILLIAN	Ann, there you are!
F	MEGAN	Think about what I said Annie!
F	LILLIAN	(to Annie) I'm saving you. Now I really want to introduce you to Helen. looking around) There she is. In slow motion, a tall and gorgeous HELEN turns to us.

F	HELEN	Perry donated a few for tonight. The room is all aflame. So how do you like our club?
F	ANNIE	Yeah, I was just telling Lillian i's very elegant.
F	HELEN	So you live in Milwaukee?
F	ANNIE	Yeah in the nice part. I work at Harrington's Jeweler's. I love it.
F	HELEN	I think I've heard of them.
F	ANNIE	It's pretty well-known in the jewelry world. It's got like the biggest market for all the jewelry they sell and 'm actually gonna be getting a promotion
F	LILLIAN	You are?
F	ANNIE	Yeah, so I'm pretty excited about it. It's gonna be...pretty big. So, if you ever need a discount--
F	HELEN	You're funny. Listen Annie,I know you said you've never been in a wedding before so I just want you to know that we all have, especially me, so if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.
F	ANNIE	Thank you. Groomsman DEAN finishes a speech. They are now in the
M	DEAN	So cheers to you two, our last single friends finally crossing over into the world of marital bliss, welcome to the other side! Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium.
F	HELEN	Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris the Third, an honored member of the bridal party. In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her.
F	ANNIE	Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees
F	HELEN	With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every...scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	They say when you choose a mate, yo're choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best friend that I could ever ask for. Annie's face goes blank.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	I have never had a friendship like this. I'm so happy you two are finally taking this big step together and I ca't wait for all of the adventures that await us. People are moved, sniffling. Including Lillian.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Now âDouglyâ, sorry, inside joke. You better not keep my Lil on a leash. I still need my drunken nights at Rockin Sushi! TO DOUGIE AND LILLIAN!!! The crowd erupts with laughter and applause. People are
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Thank you. Thank you! Now wher's Annie? Annie? Stand up Annie. The room looks around. Annie slowly rises.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	There she is. Annie is our Maid of Honor everyone. And I'm sure she'd like to take this time to say a few words. Annie? Annie stands up to the applause. The room falls silent as
F	ANNIE	Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here.
F	MEGAN	It's the candles Annie.
F	ANNIE	Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's that saying?
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It's a good one, a good saying, it's Irish. It's like a-like a toast. Is it Irish? Something about a road...Oh God, 'm blanking. So I'll just say I'm so happy to be a part of this whole celebration and happiness. You two are so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and celebrating. And I love you and....Lillian, w've been best friends since we were like 5...'ve never been to Greece... 't know if she's done. Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit âDid you ever know that you're my hero...You're everything I wish I could be..â C'mon you guys know the words. Some people reluctantly sing along. âI could fly higher then an eagle. For you are the wind beneath my wings. Flyyy, flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly until we touch up high--â Lillian and Annie are at the valet.
F	ANNIE	Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.
F	LILLIAN	No, you sang. They both laugh.
F	ANNIE	God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech--
F	LILLIAN	Ann, stop.
F	ANNIE	I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party?
F	LILLIAN	Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect. They laugh and hug. I gotta go say bye to some people I do't know. Drive safe. Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin air.
F	HELEN	Annie! Great job tonight..
F	ANNIE	I'm feeling slightly mortified.
F	HELEN	No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas.
F	ANNIE	Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
F	HELEN	Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--
F	ANNIE	She just got engaged two weeks ago.
F	HELEN	Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
F	ANNIE	Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen.
M	GUEST	Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You have beautiful cursive.
F	HELEN	Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you soon. Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her.
M	WOMAN	You're very pretty.
M	MEGAN (O.S.)	Annie! Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper.
M	MEGAN (CONT'D)	Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers. A place just opened up near my house. From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two dollar wings and all you can eat MAN sandwiches if you know what I mean. Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.
M	NAIL TECHNICIAN	Your nail too short for french manicure.
F	ANNIE	
M	NAIL TECHNICIAN	That's Ok. I fix for you. Make you sexy.
F	ANNIE	Oh, great!
M	DONNA	And then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic. Do you need some help dear? Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA
F	ANNIE	No, I got it.
M	DONNA'S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS	Annie and Donna are doing inventory. Annie gets text.
F	ANNIE	Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache.
M	DONNA	Don't be nervous. It's not all on your shoulders. Doesnt she have other bridesmaids?
F	ANNIE	Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian.
M	DONNA	I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day. They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk.
F	ANNIE	That dress is beautiful.
M	DONNA	I still have it. I was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their âceremonyâ they both wanted to wear suits. (beat) Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets. Annie struggles to write with her nails.
F	ANNIE	Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write...
M	DONNA	They're very long.
F	ANNIE	Hi. I need to make these shorter.
M	NAIL TECHNICIAN	No, not sexy!
F	ANNIE	I know, it's... I can't work with them so long.
M	NAIL TECHNICIAN	Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more sexy though.
F	ANNIE	Ok.
M	NAIL TECHNICIAN	Short nail is ugly.
F	ANNIE	Alright.
F	ANNIE	Here it is!
F	HELEN	Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed.
F	ANNIE	Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have lunch after. So, let's go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer. Oh, I didn't see that. She presses the buzzer.
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	Hello?
F	ANNIE	Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses.
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	What's your name?
F	ANNIE	Oh, Annie.
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	
F	ANNIE	about the restaurant. (back into the intercom) No, we're here to look at dresses.
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	I heard you the first time. So I take it you don't have a reservation for the dress shop?
F	BECCA	(whispers) You didn't make a reservation?
F	ANNIE	Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to make a reservation for that. Sorry! Anyway, we're all out here now and--
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	The next available appointment for bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and we don't take reservations over the intercom so you'll have to call.
F	ANNIE	Seven weeks?!
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	I'm sorry maybe you can't hear me. I just said a few seconds ago that we do't have a reservation for the next seven weeks.
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE (CONT'D)	And when you make your reservation do't forget you'll also need to make an appointment.
F	ANNIE	What?
M	DANA	appointment?
F	ANNIE	No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so...
M	VOICE FROM INSIDE	Hold on.
F	LILLIAN	Annie, we can go somewhere else.
F	ANNIE	No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry.
F	BECCA	This really is the best place though, that's the thing.
F	HELEN	Listen, I know the--
F	WHITNEY	
F	ANNIE	Yes, hello!
F	WHITNEY	We can fit you in seven weeks, that is all we have available. We only take parties that have a reservation and that have made an appointment over the phone. I'm going to ask you to not buzz in again. Thank you. Byyyyyyye. Helen approaches the intercom.
F	HELEN	Whitney?
F	WHITNEY	
F	HELEN	Whit, it's Helen.
F	WHITNEY	Helen?! Hiiii!
F	HELEN	Hiiii!
F	WHITNEY	Hi!
F	HELEN	Hi! Listen, I'm out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation- appointment wasn't made. Is there any way to fit us in?
F	WHITNEY	Say no more. Buzzzzzzzz. The girls happily enter.
F	LILLIAN	
F	LILLIAN	Ann, don't worry about it. We got in. Annie sees racks of wedding dresses.
F	ANNIE	Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses?
F	LILLIAN	Oh my God. Annie, I didn't tell you? Guess who Helen is friends with? Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu. That famous wedding dress designer tha's in all those wedding magazines? As a favor to Helen she's going to design my dress for almost nothing. Normally they're like twenty grand. She's French.
F	ANNIE	Wow. That's amazing. I have to send my measurements to France. Annie is a little disappointed.
F	LILLIAN	Surprise, surprise. It's my Mom. Mom? Can you hold on a second? She covers the phone and talks to the girls.
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	Start looking at dresses. I'll be right back. I think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since you're the ones wearing it. Cool? (nodding) Have fun! What's up Mom? Ugh! They're booked? Lillian leaves talking to her Mom.
F	HELEN	Ok ladies, start your (french) engines! Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting
F	ANNIE	Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What you mean you need to see I.D.? (giggling)
M	BARTENDER	Well, with that dress on you look about... .eleven.
F	ANNIE	Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male
M	HOT MAN IN TUX	Excuse me, you dropped an earring. An UNDERWEAR MODEL appears, in his underwear.
M	UNDERWEAR MODEL	I'll get it for her.
M	MAN IN SURGEONS SCRUBS	No I will!
M	MAN IN RED BATHING SUIT	I'll get it! I'm a lifeguard. Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her. The chaos She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to
F	ANNIE	Hi.
M	CHRISTIAN BALE	Hi. I'm Christian Bale. I'm just chopping some wood, I like to do that between movies.
F	ANNIE	Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming Oh, Christian! I need a place to hide.
M	CHRISTIAN BALE	Quick, get inside my muscles. They embrace.
M	CHRISTIAN BALE (CONT'D)	I love this sash. They look into each others' eyes, just about to kiss and--
F	HELEN	Hi Annie! She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her
F	HELEN	Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is that the dress you like?
F	ANNIE	Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash--
F	HELEN	A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts.
F	ANNIE	Huh? I told you Becca I can't wear strapless!
M	BECCA (O.S.)	Why not?! Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing.
M	DANA	Because, I--
M	LESLIE	Why don't you two shut your traps? No one's going to be looking at us. Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway.
F	MEGAN	I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the one that I found. It is a very ugly.
M	LESLIE	Absolutely not.
F	ANNIE	Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	I think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again. The sash comes in different colors not just this one.
F	HELEN	Everyone! We can't all have the dress that we want. I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, âIf invited, would I wear this a dress to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!â
M	DANA	Ooo, I never thought of it that way. All the girls agree.
F	HELEN	With that in mind, I say we wear this one. Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.
F	ANNIE	Or this one! People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time.
F	HELEN	Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music.
F	ANNIE	I think Lillian would like this one.
F	HELEN	Well, I think Lillian would like THIS one. Lillian walks in.
F	LILLIAN	Hey! I'm hearing lots of excitement in here. She touches Helen's dress.
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	Oooo, I like this one. What about you guys?
F	HELEN	I love it. Right guys? The girls all agree. Except Annie.
F	LILLIAN	Cool. Let's eat! Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows
F	HELEN	I think it might look best in cream.
F	LILLIAN	Ooh, good idea. They exit.
M	LESLIE	Well, that was easy. The girls head back to change.
F	ANNIE	This dress is almost $500!
M	DANA/BECCA	That's not too bad/that sounds about right.
F	ANNIE	No, that's what I'm saying. That's a great price.
F	LILLIAN	This place is kind of amazing. I did't even know it existed.
F	BECCA	The southwestern cobb is really good. I come here and eat sometimes.
F	MEGAN	Great, there's a fly that really likes me.
F	ANNIE	They only have salads.
M	DANA	So Annie, what's your deal? Are you dating anyone?
F	ANNIE	No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
F	BECCA	Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What happened?
F	ANNIE	It just didn't work out.
F	HELEN	Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an STD? Everyone freezes.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Lillian told me. Annie shoots Lillian a look.
F	LILLIAN	I'm sorry, I was just talking about you cause I was worried about you and--
F	ANNIE	No it's fine. But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks around.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital HPV infection.
M	LESLIE	Really?
F	ANNIE	About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
F	MEGAN	Ew, it's on the butter you guys. The fly's on the butter.
F	HELEN	Well, I don't have it.
F	ANNIE	Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past. We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule. But you know, I'm dating, here and there...
F	HELEN	Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
F	ANNIE	Oh, I didn't even think about that.
M	LESLIE	Who needs a date? Just go stag and make out with someone there.
M	DANA	If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church. We sing hymns to rock beats!
F	BECCA	Wait. I have the perfect guy for you Annie. Mike Donahue. He went to school with Kevin.
F	LILLIAN	Mike from the fourth of July last year? Ooh, I've seen him Ann. He's hot.
F	ANNIE	Really?
F	BECCA	And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.
F	HELEN	I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
F	MEGAN	The fly just committed suicide. Death by butter.
M	DANA	Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time!
M	LESLIE	Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel.
F	HELEN	(sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.
M	DANA	I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met him, I knew.
F	LILLIAN	Yeah Annie, you never know.
F	ANNIE	Yes.
F	ANNIE	What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.
M	RHODES	Well, look who it is.
F	ANNIE	Oh hi.
M	RHODES	I see your still driving around with busted tail lights.
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot(laughing). You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
M	RHODES	Nah... The reason I pulled you over today, is that--(searching) you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic.
F	ANNIE	I was?
M	RHODES	Yep. You were going ten miles under the speed limit. That's a moving violation. It's...underdriving. It's in the books. But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to write. Beat.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master Cleanse. You ever heard of it?
F	ANNIE	Yeah.
M	RHODES	Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff?
F	ANNIE	Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Sorry.
M	RHODES	No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We had tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em. (beat) Okay. I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper. OH! He hands her a business card.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop in Milwaukee. Might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights. I'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you.
F	ANNIE	Thanks.
M	RHODES	That's my name right there. In case you forgot it from last time. It's Nathan Rhodes.
F	ANNIE	Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
F	ANNIE	Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says âI'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In memory of...um, what's your friend's name? The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches.
M	SANDY	Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy open their checks.
M	SANDY (CONT'D)	Oh my God, I scored this week. 'm gonna buy Sharita a new Panasonic telephone. It's cordless and has intercom. What about you Annie?
F	ANNIE	I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again.
F	ANNIE	Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight.
F	LILLIAN	I don't know. Shoot, I can't talk now. I'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I'm so sorry. She's calling! I gotta go. Have fun! Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in.
M	STEVE	That credit lady called you again. I told her you were at the tailors.
F	ANNIE	Listen, I'm going on a date. This? (holds up a dress) or this? (what she's wearing)
M	STEVE	I don't like those pants.
F	ANNIE	What's wrong with'em?
M	STEVE	They give you four corners. Annie's not following.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	It's when a girls butt looks like it has four corners. It's not a good thing.
F	ANNIE	Shit. These are my only clean pants.
M	STEVE	Do you have a tube skirt?
F	ANNIE	Thanks Steve.
M	STEVE	Wait. If you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good. She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves.
F	ANNIE	I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike smiles, he is cute!
M	MIKE	I have to admit, I told Becca 'm not really keen on set-ups. I know i's early, but so far so good.
F	ANNIE	Me too.
M	MIKE	And thanks again for coming from Milwaukee, I know it's quite a drive.
F	ANNIE	I can do that drive in my sleep these days.
M	MIKE	Next time maybe I'll come to you. Annie smiles.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	You have got great teeth.
F	ANNIE	Thank you. I brush'em every day. She flashes her teeth. The hostess comes up.
M	HOSTESS	Your tables ready.
M	MIKE	Finally! Mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Well, I don't know about you but since we're at a Thai restaurant, I'm gonna try the dog. Mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking.
F	ANNIE	So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis.
M	MIKE	I try to squeeze in a game now and then. We should play sometime.
F	ANNIE	Oh, yeah I haven't rea-- Yeah, my game's pretty solid. I did win a couple tournaments at the club. I tend to- Jesus Christ! (whispers) It smells like B.O. in here huh? I think it's the people. A very effeminate waiter brings them their drinks.
M	WAITER	Here ya go. I'll be back to take your order in two secs. I'm swamped!
F	ANNIE	No problem.
M	MIKE	Whoa, get a load of our waiter. 'm surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in our drinks... Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable. Or AIDS. Mike laughs. Annie is HORRIFIED. Mike swigs from his Seriously, AIDS is crazy. You do't have it do you?
F	ANNIE	No.
M	MIKE	He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.
M	LATER.	Annie hasn't touched her food. He's eating with his hands So I started to get a little chub, you know what that is. How could I not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face. Anyway, I looovee massages, am I right? As he's laughing he lets out a huge burp.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	(still laughing) Whoa-ho! Excyuuuuse me! I got that from Steve Martin. Still laughing, he pats his pockets. Oh shit. I forgot my wallet.
F	ANNIE	Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me.
M	RHODES	Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out there.
F	ANNIE	Very funny, Officer...Jones?
M	RHODES	Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was.
F	ANNIE	No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk.
M	RHODES	That's ok. Call me Rhodes. (notices her drink) Trying to get âcalmâ?
F	ANNIE	Yeah. Recovering from a date.
M	RHODES	Oh.
F	ANNIE	Finish your cleanse?
M	RHODES	Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods I like eating.
F	ANNIE	Thanks for the drink. (beat) So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
M	RHODES	A lot of people get up to high speeds on this road. I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral.
F	ANNIE	That's a very good point.
M	OFFICER RHODES	Want a carrot?
F	ANNIE	Yes. I'm starving. They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.
M	RHODES	Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
F	ANNIE	The what?
M	RHODES	There's one in every bag. You should eat it.
F	ANNIE	No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands. No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!! She throws it on the ground.
M	RHODES	Don't litter. He picks it up.
F	ANNIE	I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life.
M	RHODES	Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems unnatural.
F	ANNIE	I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
M	RHODES	Just tell her the truth.
F	ANNIE	Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car. It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students.
M	RHODES	You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop. And I love my job.
F	ANNIE	Hmm. I think I get it?
M	RHODES	Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road.
F	ANNIE	Moonpies. What?
M	RHODES	It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over.
F	ANNIE	Oh yeah.
M	OFFICER RHODES	When I get married I don't want the kind of wedding people have these days. I want it to be like a carnival. You know dunk tanks? People win prizes...
F	ANNIE	Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
M	OFFICER RHODES	Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.
F	ANNIE	Sorry. (to clerk) Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie? They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of
M	OFFICER RHODES	And then she moved to Hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice. And supposedly she has really long armpit hair now. That's pretty much the last girlfriend I had.
F	ANNIE	Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off. Because I can't find him.
M	OFFICER RHODES	Wow. You win. Annie in her car, engine running.
F	ANNIE	Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should probably...
M	RHODES	Oh, before you go. There is something I want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I think you'll want this now. He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
F	ANNIE	For me?!
M	OFFICER RHODES	Well I know you've had a terrible night. He gives it to her. Her phone rings.
F	ANNIE	Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths... I guess I'll see you around?
M	RHODES	Yeah. Don't forget about those taillights. They're really starting to bug me.
F	ANNIE	K. Bye.(to Ted) So, you're in town? He opens the front door, leading Annie out again.
M	TED	Next time I won't call so late.
F	ANNIE	No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was just driving.
M	TED	Awesome. It's cool that we can just hookup and whatever. No strings.
F	ANNIE	Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.
M	TED	Cool. Bye.
F	ANNIE	Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Hi, Donna, it's Annie. Um, sorry but I just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a little bit late. Yes, I know, 'm really sorry. I will get there as soon as I can. I promise, I'm so sor---hello?
F	HELEN	Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late. Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	I had to come into Milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and I thought I'd come in and say hi.
F	ANNIE	Hi!
F	HELEN	And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
F	ANNIE	Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't that technically be me? Honor?
F	HELEN	Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something. That would be fun. Where are the diamonds?
F	ANNIE	Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.
F	HELEN	Oh! And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.
F	ANNIE	Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So I'll let you know.
F	HELEN	Can't wait.
M	TV HOST	Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning.
M	GIRL ON SHOW	Thanks.
M	STEVE	Unbelievable. (to Annie) You got another package from your mom.
F	ANNIE	Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.
M	STEVE	No problem. But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty car.
F	ANNIE	Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas?
M	STEVE	Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense?
F	ANNIE	I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been.
M	STEVE	Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings. When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay?
F	ANNIE	No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride.
M	STEVE	Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas.
F	ANNIE	Well, I could save up for it.
M	STEVE	No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, âNight Moves.â Can I have this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag.
F	ANNIE	Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer We see these words: âDear bridal partyâ, âgreat ideaâ, Hello?
F	HELEN	Hi.
F	ANNIE	Hi.
F	HELEN	Hiiiii.
F	ANNIE	Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All
F	HELEN	I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?
F	ANNIE	Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days.
F	HELEN	But a bachelorette at Sea World?
F	ANNIE	Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it.
F	HELEN	Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings.
F	ANNIE	Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Hello?
F	BECCA	Hi, Annie. It's Becca. Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey? That's where we went for for MY bachelorette.
F	ANNIE	Oh well, Turkey's really far away.
F	BECCA	It's super old though! They have awesome restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like that.
F	ANNIE	Hang on... Annie clicks back over to Helen.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back?
F	HELEN	When?
F	ANNIE	Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Becca?
F	BECCA	Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas.
F	ANNIE	Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.
F	BECCA	I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I have a system. Annie's other line.
F	ANNIE	Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back?
F	BECCA	When?
F	ANNIE	Soon. Annie clicks over.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	DANA	Annie, it's Dana!
F	ANNIE	Of course it is.. Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade.
M	DANA	I love your idea about Sea World.
F	ANNIE	Really?
M	DANA	Yeah, but then Helen just called me and said we should go to Vegas.
F	ANNIE	But Vegas is so hot, don't you think? It's like, hot and dry. People get sick there all the time.
M	DANA	I haven't had that experience. My skin always clears up there.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, I just think it's probably not-- Hold on. (clicks over) Hello?
F	MEGAN	Annie, it's Megan. Megan is at work, in front of a wall of computer and I can't talk right now, but I was thinking for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend. Have you ever heard of the Nevada Project?
F	ANNIE	Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill.
M	LESLIE	I gotta be honest. I've been married for nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and I want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some point during this trip. I'll pay whatever I have to pay. (to the kids) Tyler stop it, put that back! Paul!
F	BECCA	Vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors--
M	DANA	Or we could take hummer limos around everywhere.
F	ANNIE	That sounds really expensive.
F	HELEN	Oh but it's gonna be so much fun! Besides money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's our friend.
F	ANNIE	Oh no, no, I was just thinking about everyone else. That's all I'm saying.
F	MEGAN	What I'm saying is, they drop you off in the middle of the desert. You have to kill your own food and find your way back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.
M	LESLIE	Seriously. I want balls in my face.
F	BECCA	So I think Vegas is a good idea.
M	DANA	I agree with Helen. Vegas.
F	MEGAN	Oh, you know what else is in Nevada? Vegas!
M	LESLIE	Balls. Vegas.
F	HELEN	Vegas it is.
F	LILLIAN	goin' to Vegas!
M	SANDY	No can do, I need all my shifts. 'm trying to save up and take my lady to Maui.
F	ANNIE	Please, one day a week, just for a little while. I've already asked everybody else. I really need the money.
M	SANDY	Sorry. My hands are tied. Sharita's got my dick in a chip-clip.
F	ANNIE	That's alright. I understand.
M	SANDY	Mmm. Mm. These are the best peanut butter titties you ever made.
F	ANNIE	They're called peanut butter kisses.
M	SANDY	That's not what they look like.
F	MEGAN	Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now? We are gonna nail it down. We should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins!
F	ANNIE	Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas! Woo! Lillian walks up.
F	LILLIAN	Annie, come here. Why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us?
F	ANNIE	Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket. I'm here though, right?!
F	LILLIAN	I'm so excited!
F	ANNIE	Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party! We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites... As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. âThe New
F	HELEN	Lillian, look what's happening.
F	LILLIAN	Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?!
F	HELEN	I got a limo from the hotel. We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!! They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.
F	ANNIE	Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a ride to the hotel. It's taken care of.
F	MEGAN	(from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie!
F	LILLIAN	This hotel is amazing! You guys!
F	HELEN	Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite. It's all set.
F	LILLIAN	Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one hour! (waving her key) Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement. Annie
F	ANNIE	Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head?
F	ANNIE	Hi, I have a reservation for Walker. RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front
M	RICK	Okay, two nights?
F	ANNIE	Yes. Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never
M	RICK	Do you want towels?
F	ANNIE	Yes.
M	RICK	Do you need sheets?
F	ANNIE	Yes.
M	RICK	No pillow though, ok? Annie just stares at him.
M	HELEN AND LILLIAN	
F	ANNIE	Oh my God.
F	MEGAN	Oh my gosh, I can't believe this.
M	LESLIE	He-llo Vegas!
F	ANNIE	Hello cat.
F	ANNIE	
F	BECCA	Oooh, Annie's here!
M	BRIDESMAIDS	Wooooooh!
F	BECCA	Isn't this amazing? Lillian runs over and hugs Annie, wearing a condom veil
F	LILLIAN	Annie! I wanna see a drink in your hand in one minute! Lillian pulls Annie into the room. Helen is getting off
F	HELEN	Ok you guys, change of plans. The Velour Cobra had an opening at 9 so I got us a dinner reservation. Isn't that radical?
M	EVERYONE	Woohooo/Ooooh/Alright!
F	ANNIE	Oh. Yeah. Cool. Alright Everyone raises their glasses. The night has begun.
F	ANNIE	Okay, mine was...great, got it. Becca scoots in next to her.
F	BECCA	Annie, I didn't get a chance to ask you, how was your date with Mike? Give me all the details.
F	ANNIE	Oh, um, we had dinner.
F	BECCA	Do you think you'll go out with him again? He told Kevin he thought you were really great and hot.
M	LESLIE	the damage down there?
F	ANNIE	Oh, I got it right here, I figured out what I owe so, should I just pass it around? Why don't we just all split it? It's so much easier.
M	BECCA,DANA,HELEN,MEGAN	Yeah/Just split it/Who cares?
F	ANNIE	Yeah, it's probably just easier...just split it.
F	MEGAN	Here, let me see it. Ok.. .It's a hundred each plus tip.
F	ANNIE	
F	MEGAN	Plus we're paying for Lillian...everyone just put $125.
F	ANNIE	(sotto) No alcohol...or any real food.
F	BECCA	It'll all even out by the end of the night.
F	ANNIE	How does it even out? How does that happen? Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money. Helen
F	LILLIAN	Thank you everybody!!
F	HELEN	Annie, don't tell Lillian, it's a surprise.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	My friend Sean Michael works for a promotional company and they're having this big event tonight at Tara Rei's stepbrother's Club, Sacrifice.
F	ANNIE	Really?!
F	HELEN	I think it should be our first stop. H's reserving seats for us in the VIP section. It's a $150 cover and there's a one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per table, he said people from the Real World go in there all the time.
F	ANNIE	I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge after this.
F	HELEN	We are. After that.
F	ANNIE	Oh...um...wow. Awesome. Here's the thing I was going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites. I think I ate something weird on the plane probably, my stomac's not right.
F	HELEN	Oh, well we're only gonna be there for an hour or so, you can just meet up with us after.
F	ANNIE	Okay. Perfect.
F	HELEN	I'll just text you when we're getting ready to leave. I hope you feel better. Lillian comes up already a little tipsy.
F	LILLIAN	Ok, Leslie spilled the beans. Le's get our asses over to Sacrifice. What are we waiting for? Wooooooo! Lillian looks at Helen's legs.
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	Whoa whoa. Helen, turn around. Are those those Ransom Jeans?
F	HELEN	Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them from New York. They're insanely expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny. She sticks her butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the
F	LILLIAN	Oh my God, Annie our song! Wher's Annie?

F	MEGAN	I don't know!(to Helen) Where's Annie!

F	HELEN	She's meeting us later!!!
M	DANA	(to Lillian) Oh. She's meeting us there!
F	LILLIAN	Why!?
F	BECCA	I don't know! Why?
F	HELEN	Annie HAS DIARRHEA!!
F	LILLIAN	Is she okay?! Should I call her!?
F	HELEN	She's fine! She's gonna meet us in an hour, it's all set! (to the other girls]
M	ANNIE HAD REALLY BAD DIARHEA!	They continue partying, drinking, dancing.
M	DAVE	No, no, no wait. Wait. (to Annie) Hey, will you roll for me? Can she roll for me?

F	ANNIE	
M	GUYS	Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie gets a text message.

M	CRAPS GUY	No cell phones at the tables m'am. Its a casino rule.
F	ANNIE	I'll go outside then.
M	CRAPS GUY	No, you gotta play the game out. You have to finish your roll. She continues to roll all fours. The guys scream.
F	ANNIE	Ok, guys put me down, put me down. Whoa, that's my breast.
M	BRIAN #1	Sorry. She reads a text message from Helen. âWe're leaving
F	ANNIE	It was nice meeting you guys. I gotta go.
M	DAVE	What do you mean? Where are you going?
F	ANNIE	I'm here with a bunch of friends and 'm supposed to meet them at this club.
M	MARK	We love clubs! We'll come with you.
M	DAVE	Come on, we'll get your cab.
F	ANNIE	Oh, Ok. As the cab drives away, we hear:
M	BRIAN 1 (O.S.)	Dude, we gotta get Brian some food asap. I've seen that look before.
F	ANNIE	You guys almost done?
M	BRIAN 2	Sorry we haven't eaten all day.
M	MATT	I have NEVER seen a drive-thru line like that dude.
M	CAB DRIVER	It's because of the concert. They continue eating. The cab is pulled over, all the guys are outside, peeing. She texts back, âOn my way!â A huge fist fight is going on in the car, yelling etc.
M	CONTINUOUS:	Traffic has stopped.
F	ANNIE	How much further?
M	CAB DRIVER	Do you think I know? How do you think I know?
M	DAVE	Oh, shit. We can't go into this place. We got kicked out last night.

F	LILLIAN	What do you mean here, where?
F	ANNIE	I'm at the Jungle Lounge, where are you guys? This place is huge!
F	LILLIAN	You're where?
F	ANNIE	The club!
F	LILLIAN	Listen I can't hear you! We had to leave the Jungle Lounge, Becca--

M	GUYS	Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah!
M	DAVE	What happened to you?
F	ANNIE	I don't even know.
M	DAVE	Roller, I can't stand seeing you like this. (to bartender] Get this fine lady a shot!
F	ANNIE	I'll have two lemon drops. Annie and Dave are wasted.
F	ANNIE	That's what I'm saying. Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things. It's not fair. I don't get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen.
M	DAVE	I hate Helen.
F	ANNIE	That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said.
M	DAVE	I hate Helen. The cat jumps on the bed and meows. Annie opens her eyes
M	DAVE	Hey.
F	ANNIE	Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were making out. I guess I was pretty tired.
M	DAVE	Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey.
F	ANNIE	Oh shit. There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal
M	NICOLE	Is Dave here?
M	DAVE	Nicole!? Hey, Nic.
M	NICOLE	This is a surprise. Brian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well.
M	BRIAN 1	Dude, I'm sorry. She made us bring her here.
M	MARK	She said you have her fake I.D..
M	NICOLE	Yeah and I couldn't go anywhere last night. I tried calling you fifty fucking times. And YOU? You were what, hooking up with this fossil?!
F	ANNIE	First of all-
M	NICOLE	Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass bitch.
F	ANNIE	Ok, that is not nice.
M	NICOLE	And what are you forty?
F	ANNIE	No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her breath) and you could never kick my ass.
M	NICOLE	What did you say?!
F	ANNIE	Annie immediately gets punched in the face. Annie is
M	NICOLE	Baker Community College bitch! The girls leave in victory. Dave turns and mouths to
F	MEGAN	Annie!
F	LILLIAN	Whoa. What are you, going to a rodeo?
F	ANNIE	That's hilarious.
F	MEGAN	Annie, you missed it. I scammed all night last night. I met this guy named Darwin. He works for Cingular. He had a friend.
M	LESLIE	What happened to your face?
F	LILLIAN	Yeah, why are you wearing all that makeup?
F	ANNIE	It's covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey. I got into fight with a community college student and her friends because I spent the night with her boyfriend after spending the entire night trying to find you.
F	LILLIAN	What?!
F	ANNIE	Forget it.
F	LILLIAN	I was trying to find YOU. I tried to call you all night!
F	ANNIE	Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a minute? Annie takes Lillian away.
F	LILLIAN	What is going on? You told Helen you were sick.
F	ANNIE	I wasn't sick. Helen told you that because... I couldn't afford to go with you guys.
F	LILLIAN	Why didn't you say something?--
M	HELEN (O.S.)	Lillian, we're going to be late for our honey facials.
F	ANNIE	Helen, can you just give us a minute?
F	HELEN	I'm just saying, we're gonna be late. I don't wanna be rude.
F	ANNIE	That's funny. You know what? As the Maid of honor, which is what I am and what you are not, I am asking you to just give us a minute.
F	HELEN	Excuse me Annie.
F	ANNIE	No, excuse me!
F	LILLIAN	Annie take it easy.
F	ANNIE	I need to take it easy?
M	DANA	Annie, if it makes you feel any better night.
M	LESLIE	Here we go...
M	DANA	By this huge girl. She was a working in the bathroom. I just... I didn't cut in line. I didn't! She chased me!
F	BECCA	Becca it's over.
F	MEGAN	Annie, she looked like Popeye.
F	BECCA	She lives here! She lives in Vegas.
F	HELEN	You're not going to run into her. Just shut-up about it.
F	LILLIAN	Guys stop! Please! Annie, I'm so sorry about last night. I feel horrible. I want to hear everything that happened. Tonight, you're not leaving my side. We're hittin' the strip club all of us and we're going to put this shit behind us. Okay?! The girls agree. Dana rubs her arm.
M	LESLIE	Oh your arm does not still hurt.
M	COCKTAILER	What can I get you ladies?
F	ANNIE	First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here. Here's a hundred. Keep twenty for yourself.
F	LILLIAN	Oooh, Ann! A siren goes off.
M	V.O.	Good evening ladies, and welcome to Thunderbird. Our first male entertainer has been roaming the prairie for many, many lonely nights... A horse winnies. Ladies scream.
M	V.O. (CONT'D)	Here he is...looking for a sweet lady to keep him company under the stars...say hello to Cowboy Ron! A male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping
M	'S	looking for someone. The room goes wild.
M	V.O. (CONT'D)	There he is ladies looking for that special woman, looking for his briiide...And I believe the person he's looking for is Lillian Donovan! The girls scream. Lillian mouths to Annie âI'm gonna kill
F	MEGAN	Leslie, your missing it.
M	LESLIE	Don't talk to me. Nobody talk to me. Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is Stripper #2 appears.
M	V.O.	Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend on the prairie and he's lookin' for a lady too.
F	LILLIAN	(pointing to Annie) Get her! Get her!! Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the another girl. Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing.
F	ANNIE	I need some gum.
F	BECCA	That was disgusting! I'm so glad I'm married.
F	MEGAN	It was awesome!
M	DANA	I got a picture of the balls. I got it!
M	LESLIE	bitch.
F	LILLIAN	Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment of the weekend. Annie finally feels a part of the group.
F	LILLIAN	Oh look, there's your boyfriend.
F	HELEN	Ew, he's like 65. Ok, look Lillian that's you.
F	LILLIAN	Oh my God. You know who that actually looks like? Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels--
F	HELEN	Ew, at that beach, that weird beach!
F	LILLIAN	And that lady came up to us wearing that mesh top!
F	HELEN	She was crazy. Annie sinks. A flight attendant appears.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Excuse me. Hi.
F	ANNIE	Hi.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	I'm sorry, you can't be up here. You have to go back to coach.
F	ANNIE	I was just stretching my legs.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	That's not true. Annie stares at her. The flight attendant holds out her
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)	Come on...it's ok, c'mon. C'mon.
M	ATTENDANT	Ok, that's going to be seventy -five dollars.
F	ANNIE	What?
M	ATTENDANT	Twenty-five dollars a day. Three days. Seventy -five dollars.
F	ANNIE	I thought it was seven.
M	ATTENDANT	Oh, hmm mm. That's for this lot, you parked in this lot. The lots are exactly the same, separated by a white line. Annie is driving. She sees Rhodes, and stops.
M	RHODES	Oh, I know what's going on. You're jealous of that Helen girl.
F	ANNIE	Excuse me? No, I'm not.
M	RHODES	If you say so.
F	ANNIE	I'm telling you I am not jealous of Helen, okay? She's tall and thin and rich and pretty. They both laugh.
M	RHODES	Oh come on, you know you got it goin' on...
F	ANNIE	Oh yeah, I got it goin' on...
M	RHODES	You're right, you don't.
F	ANNIE	They nudge each other. He accidentally nudges her off the
M	RHODES	Sorry! Now Annie is back in her running car.
F	ANNIE	Have a good rest of your shift.
M	RHODES	Actually, I'm heading home. Got my sister staying with me for a few days. Sh's been thinking of divorcing of her husband.
F	ANNIE	Oh. Sorry.
M	RHODES	He had an affair and they've got kids so it's complicated.
F	ANNIE	Hmm. Sounds familiar.
M	RHODES	My sister is a hell of a woman, you know? And her husband is- you know what I think cheating is? It's weak. It's a weak person that cheats. Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a new light.
F	ANNIE	No, no. Um, I feel the same way. Um, anyway um, maybe I'll drive by you next week. I have to make this drive again...so... She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back. He sees
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the soap at the hotel. Ahhhhh.
M	RHODES	Yeah. I should go..now. Don't forget to call my friend about those tail lights. They're really starting to bug me.
F	ANNIE	I promise. Ok, well, have a good weekend.
M	RHODES	You too. He abruptly walks back to his car. She drives away She opens the book, sees chapters entitled âYou Don't
M	DOCTOR	Well, I've got good news for you. You're going to live. Hahahah. It's not an allergic reaction though.
F	ANNIE	Oh, that's good.
M	DOCTOR	You've got body lice.
F	ANNIE	Oh.
M	DOCTOR	Have you recently come in contact with or slept anywhere that you think you might
F	ANNIE	I know where I got it.
M	DOCTOR	You're gonna have to wash every fabric in your apartment and I'll give you a topical cream that should knock it out pretty quick. I've got some samples. Annie sits on the doorstep. Lillian runs up with a bunch
F	LILLIAN	I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh. What's that on your arms? She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion.
F	ANNIE	Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it.
F	LILLIAN	Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one thing really quick. When is my hair consultation? Lillian frantically looks through her calender.
F	ANNIE	Listen, I want to talk to you about--
F	LILLIAN	
F	ANNIE	What's wrong?
F	LILLIAN	I knew it. I'm going to have my period on my wedding day...and my honeymoon!
F	ANNIE	It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your first time doing it.
F	LILLIAN	It's our wedding night though!
F	ANNIE	You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed.
F	LILLIAN	I can't believe this. This sucks. (beat) Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio?
M	ANNIE'	Can you just realize what you just asked me right now?
F	LILLIAN	What?
F	ANNIE	You just said a string trio or horn trio. I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just âkeep it simple.â âNot a big deal.â
F	LILLIAN	I know but now that I'm planning everything it's just...I wanna do it right. It's once in a life time. It's my wedding. Lillian's phone rings.
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me because I won't let her invite everyone from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know? I gotta free up some spots. (into phone] Hello? Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless.
F	ANNIE	Helen.
F	HELEN	Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck?
F	ANNIE	No, I'm doing laundry, what's up?
F	HELEN	Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We haven't heard from you and everyone is-
F	ANNIE	I know. I know. I'm trying to--
F	HELEN	Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian.
F	ANNIE	Wow.
F	HELEN	You don't have to give me an answer now
F	ANNIE	You should have it. You should have it.
F	HELEN	Great. Well, I'll definitely need some help.
F	ANNIE	Ok?
F	HELEN	Could you bring the cookies? Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles. Pissed.
M	GIRL	Excuse me!! A snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands
M	GIRL (CONT'D)	I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend.
F	ANNIE	Your best friend?
M	GIRL	Yeah.
F	ANNIE	For now.
M	GIRL	
F	ANNIE	Well, what's gonna happen when you get older? Did you ever think of that? What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are? Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping. Huh? And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent?
M	GIRL	Ummm....you're weird.
F	ANNIE	You're stupid.
M	GIRL	You have no chin.
F	ANNIE	You're gonna be a slut in high school.
M	GIRL	You are an old, single loser who has no friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car. She sips in victory, slurps up the last drop noisily.
F	ANNIE	The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the
F	ANNIE	Bye.
M	DONNA	You know, I knew a girl once. Karen Stippleton. She was really something. The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night. But one evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store. And I'm gonna say something to you I should have told her. Don't waste your life. Find out what your gifts are and use them. Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room.
M	STEVE	Ooh, another package from your mom?
F	ANNIE	Yep. It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her She reads, âA Shower for Lillian.â Steve comes over to see. On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of Are you kidding me? The invitation reads:

M	JUDY	Is there an animal over there?
F	ANNIE	No, it's a C.D. She rolls over and turns it off.
M	JUDY	So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day of the shower cause I wanna get my hair done. Did you see that invitation? I didn't get the significance of the dead butterfly, but it looks like w're gonna have fun.
F	ANNIE	I'm not.
M	JUDY	Oh, c'mon.
F	ANNIE	I already know what it's gonna be like. It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go.
M	JUDY	Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca't let her new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history with her that no one else has. So you walk into that party knowing that.
F	ANNIE	Oh my God. She turns into the gates of âWhitewater Estates.â There
M	BUTLER	Are you a guest of Helen Harris?
F	ANNIE	Yes.
M	BUTLER	The shower is one mile away. He hands her a pink lemonade.

M	VALET	This will be placed in the gift room for you madame. He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.
F	ANNIE	I'll take those. Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she
M	HORSEMAN	Would you like an assisted ride to the main house?
F	ANNIE	Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she

F	BECCA	That's a big cookie huh.
F	ANNIE	Where? They point to the âsignâ. Annie walks closer to see it is
M	LESLIE	See. Sugar cookie. Leslie takes a piece off, eats it.
M	LESLIE (CONT'D)	It's even better if you dip it in the chocolate. REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls
F	LILLIAN	Annieee!!! Lillian runs to her.
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	(under her breath) Can you believe this? Lillian!
F	LILLIAN	Coming Mom! I gotta go say hi to my aunts. She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again.

F	ANNIE	Beautiful party.
F	HELEN	Oh, it's nothing....so...Just make yourself at home. Enjoy!
F	ANNIE	Thanks. (under her breath) Asshole.
F	HELEN	What did you say?
F	ANNIE	I said I love this shower, and i's amazing. I said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets
F	HELEN	OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance with the GUESTS!
M	'S	looking. Annie puts lotion her hands. She sees a magazine photo of

F	MEGAN	Annie, did you see the party favors?
F	ANNIE	I'm sure they're perfect and amazing.
F	MEGAN	They're dogs!
F	ANNIE	What?
F	MEGAN	Yeah. And they're wrapped up like presents. They said we have to wait until we leave but I cant stop thinking about them. I gotta go tell Lillian. Annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain. She attention by microphone.
F	HELEN	Hello ladies. Bonjour. (french sentence)Yay! Welcome. I am your host Helen, a bridesmaid in Lillian's wedding. I want you all to have a wonderful time. Eat, drink, please have some cookie! She laughs and then becomes very serious.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Lillian. Today's your day. I'd like to make a beautiful toast, âYou are pretty, fun, sweet, look at all of your friends. Girlpower!â Everyone enjoy your lunch, served along with the musical stylings of...The LILLIANETTE'S!!! A quartet, all in pink and white and harmonize. âLillian, girl...â Judy claps and enjoys the music. She leans over to Annie.
M	JUDY	I don't know what's going on honey. The shower is a hit.
M	DANA	Everyone it's game time! Please take your piece of paper, put it on top of your head, and with your other hand try to draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby is going to look like!!! Ready? GO! Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings,
M	DANA (CONT'D)	And the winner is...Annie? Dana holds up a perfectly realistic drawing of a baby.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, that's mine. Thank you. Girls spin a blind-folded 86 year old ELLIE around 3
M	SHOWER GIRLS	One... two...three! Annie looks confused. They throw Ellie onto a huge pile
M	SHOWER GIRLS (CONT'D)	Find the veil! C'mon Ellie! Come on Look! You can do it! It's right there! Ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows. She finds YAAAAY! YOU DID IT! WoooHoo!
F	HELEN	#9. What is Lillian's favorite ice cream flavor? Write it down...quickly.
F	ANNIE	her) Ew. Kinda smells funny in here. Doesn't it? Smells bad. This house has a weird smell.
F	HELEN	OK, last one. For the big prize. #10. What is the craziest place Lillian and Dougie....? Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of saying, â...had sex?â Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh.
F	ANNIE	someone's a pervert. It's none of my business. She's gross.
M	GIRL 1	on this âadvice necklaceâ to represent the ocean. It may not always be smooth sailing but you can ride the waves together. Dana cries and takes a picture. Everyone applauds,
F	ANNIE	really polluted right now. Its not something to joke about. Lillian opens presents in front of huge photograph of
F	LILLIAN	Oh! My towels! Thank you Dana.
M	DANA	I just wanted to get you something you could use everyday and something pretty. Dana takes a picture, Lillian grabs another box, giddy.
F	LILLIAN	Annie. (opens it) Oh, our mugs! Thank you Annie.
F	ANNIE	Well, you registered for 'em so thank yourself, you picked them out. I did't do anything...
F	HELEN	This one's from me. Helen hands Lillian her gift. Lil opens it and holds up
M	SHOWER GIRLS	Oooo/Ahhhhh etc.
F	MEGAN	Ooh, brothel gear...
F	ANNIE	
F	LILLIAN	Wait, what's this? Lillian pulls out an envelope.
F	ANNIE	(sotto) Wow, cash. Kinda tacky. Lillian opens the envelope.
F	LILLIAN	Oh my God. Helen. Lillian holds up the tickets.
M	LAURIE	Honey what are they?
F	LILLIAN	Two first class tickets to Sea World. How did you--
F	ANNIE	Are you fucking kidding me?
M	JUDY	Annie!
F	LILLIAN	Annie! What is going on with you?
F	ANNIE	Nothing have fun at Sea World.
F	HELEN	Why don't we go in the other room and--
F	ANNIE	Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--.
F	HELEN	Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don't know what you mean.
F	ANNIE	I think you do.(laughs) Horses? Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture! (pointing outside) And look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie. I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers? Everyone is watching Annie. She is fighting and punching Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her.
F	LILLIAN	Annie stop! I don't know what's going on.
F	ANNIE	Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit.
F	LILLIAN	I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds?
F	ANNIE	I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you!
F	LILLIAN	This is my wedding and you've made it all about you.
F	ANNIE	Well at least my friendship's not for sale. This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms
F	HELEN	Do you think she still has body lice?
F	LILLIAN	Anyone else?! Anyone else have something they wanna say to me?! Dana can't contain herself.
M	DANA	I got my chin done! Becca stands up.
F	BECCA	Kevin smokes pot! Leslie stands up.
M	LESLIE	I'm pregnant! Megan stands up.
F	MEGAN	I took two dogs already. There in the back of my van!
F	ANNIE	Thank you! Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes. Rhodes is looking under her hood.
M	RHODES	Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
F	ANNIE	Yes. Taillights. I know!
M	RHODES	You should've taken it to my friend-
F	ANNIE	I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't--
M	RHODES	Whoa. Don't take it out on me. This is your fault.
F	ANNIE	HE hit ME!
M	RHODES	You had no taillights! You did't get them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe else. It's your fault. Annie starts to walk away.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	Where you going?! Annie keeps walking.
M	RHODES (CONT'D)	Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?! Another WISE decision! What do you know?!!
M	RHODES	I know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here! YOU did not make an effort to fix that problem. This hits Annie. Rhodes is physically worked up.
F	ANNIE	Why are you yelling at me?!
M	RHODES	It's dangerous! You're putting your life, and others in danger!
F	ANNIE	I'm! Sorry! He calms down.
M	RHODES	Look, all I know, is that you're kinda crazy. You're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me! And for some reason, all I've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date.
F	ANNIE	Well save yourself the trouble, and don't.
M	RHODES	Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy anyway. Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!
F	ANNIE	Well, I have said ânoâ anyway.
M	RHODES	Well, then you have yourself a good night ma'am. Annie regrets that. He drives away leaving her there. She BILL enters with a clip board. He is a stocky Milwaukee
M	BILL	Rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in. I'm Bill Cozbi.
F	ANNIE	Oh, hi.
M	BILL	I was beginning to think we'd never see ya.
F	ANNIE	Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
M	BILL	Nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff. But you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so.
F	ANNIE	A week?
M	STEVE	So you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower?
F	ANNIE	Yes I did. Everything's just... She starts crying. Steve hands her a tissue from the
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, I just--this has been a really shitty day.
M	STEVE	Yeah. Ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those.
F	ANNIE	Yes I do! Right? Thank you.
M	STEVE	Have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty? Annie stares at him. I'm just saying, maybe it's your attitude.
F	ANNIE	This is not about attitude. It's just the facts! My life hasn't turned it out the way I expected. I don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world.
M	STEVE	I think that might be your problem. I think you read too many of those magazines. You don't need things to be someone. Tyra said that. Tyra Banks.
M	'S	Lillian. She doesn't even know what to say, so she doesn't answer.
M	WOMAN	Is anyone sitting here?
F	ANNIE	No. The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her.
M	TED	Hey Annie.
F	ANNIE	Oh, hey Ted. You're in town.
M	TED	Yeah, yeah. Listen I'm going out tonight but I should be home around 11, you wanna come over?
F	ANNIE	Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves.
M	'S	names cut out and being placed at different tables. Her
M	BACK TO ANNIE'S BEDROOM	Annie sadly hangs up.
M	TIM	Well, I can't think of anything else to tell you. Did you have any questions?
F	ANNIE	No, I think we've covered everything. I'm really excited and thank you. Annie gathers her things. I'll see you next Monday. What time do I start?
M	TIM	Four a.m. Annie is a little surprised. Ti's smiling.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	You'll get used to it. Annie smiles back.
F	ANNIE	I won't be late.
M	TIM	Oh and I wanna try one of those moonpies.
F	ANNIE	
F	ANNIE	Hi, I'm here to inquire about financial aid. Her cell phone rings.
M	ADMINISTRATION LADY	Take these to the second window.
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry? Annie's trying to find her phone.
M	ADMINISTRATION LADY	The second window.
F	ANNIE	Thanks. It's too late, she looks at her phone. It was Lillian. No
M	BILL	Parts and labor, we're lookin' at eight hundred dollars. But with your discount...
F	ANNIE	Discount?
M	RHODES	Yeah. Rhodes and I worked out a deal way back when, so, this one's on the house.
F	ANNIE	Are you serious?
M	BILL	Yep. I owe him big time. He runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates. There's been a lot of 'em.
F	ANNIE	You're kidding! If you see him, would you thank him for me and tell him that I'm crazy and I'm sorry. He'll know what you mean.
M	'T	pull her over. She drives by him again and swerves all 't get to this point until this morning. wanted to see if we're going in the right direction with annie uniting bridesmaids and saving the day.
M	STEVE	Ok, you can take Women's Studies or Spanish...oooh The History of Wine. The phone rings.
F	ANNIE	Hello?
F	MEGAN	Annie. It's Megan, Becca Leslie, Dana and Helen.
F	ANNIE	Oh. Hi--
F	MEGAN	Lillian's missing!
F	ANNIE	What do you mean she's missing?
F	MEGAN	We were all supposed to get spray-tans today and she never showed up. No on's heard from her. She could be anywhere, doing anything! She could be ANYWHERE--
M	LESLIE	Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone. Leslie grabs the phone from Megan.
M	LESLIE (CONT'D)	Annie, it's Leslie. Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. The weddin's the day after tomorrow, she's been really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere. We just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge. Any ideas?
F	ANNIE	Um, gosh I..I don't know. Um, I'll come to you guys. I'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. I wanna help. Annie hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and
M	STEVE	What about the Science of Jazz?
M	DANA	Maybe she's at the park.
F	HELEN	The park? Don't be stupid Dana.
M	LESLIE	Jeez, take it easy.
F	HELEN	Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.
F	MEGAN	Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always hides in Mexico.
F	BECCA	I don't think she'd leave the country. Maybe she went to the reservoir.
F	HELEN	Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a big tank of water.
M	DANA	Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning walk there. It's the next best thing to a lake.
F	ANNIE	Oh my God! I think I know where she is.
M	LESLIE	How much further?
F	ANNIE	We're almost there.
F	BECCA	I'm think I'm getting carsick. Is that supposed to be a dig on my driving?
M	DANA	Well you do speed up and slow down a lot.
F	HELEN	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt driving course in Renegade missions.
F	BECCA	Why do you always have to be so condescending?
M	LESLIE	Yeah, its getting really old.
F	HELEN	I was being funny!
M	DANA	Well it came out a little mean Helen.
F	HELEN	Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the
F	BECCA	What was that?
M	DANA	Did we hit something!?
F	HELEN	Was it a person?
F	ANNIE	Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car. No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch dark out.
F	HELEN	Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.
M	LESLIE	You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit.
F	ANNIE	Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on.
M	LESLIE	I'm calling AAA.
F	BECCA	I'm calling Kevin!
F	ANNIE	Helen, do you have a jack?
F	HELEN	Probably?!
M	DANA	What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal?
F	ANNIE	Dana calm down.
M	LESLIE	Shit! I don't have any service.
F	BECCA	Me neither!
M	DANA	Oh my God! We're gonna die... Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk,
F	ANNIE	Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do.
M	LESLIE	So, how can I help?
F	ANNIE	Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug
M	DANA	That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire.
F	BECCA	I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.
F	HELEN	Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.
M	DANA	So what are you doing now?
F	ANNIE	I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off.
F	BECCA	How does that little thing lift the whole car?
F	MEGAN	It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
M	LESLIE	How do you know this stuff?
F	MEGAN	I like cars. There's a real artistry to them.
F	HELEN	Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night.
M	DANA	Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait. Everyone's speechless.
F	HELEN	Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.
M	DANA	I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.
M	DANA (CONT'D)	Lillian probably left because of you anyway.
F	HELEN	What!?
M	DANA	You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was right.
F	MEGAN	Yeah! Helen glares at Megan.
F	HELEN	What are you talking about? The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister. Weirdo.
F	MEGAN	I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.
F	HELEN	Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry. Everyone looks at Annie.
M	LESLIE	I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over. The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at-
M	TRANS AM MAN	Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies doing? Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets
F	ANNIE	Just changing the tire.
M	TRANS AM MAN	You guys need some man hands for that?
F	ANNIE	Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
M	TRANS AM MAN	Look, if you guys get tired, I live right up that hill. You ladies can just leave your car here, come on up and let us all lay down together. He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared.
F	MEGAN	Hey! Are those snowflake rims? The guy looks at Megan.
M	TRANS AM MAN	Yeah, found âem in a junk yard. Restored âem myself.
F	MEGAN	I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
M	TRANS AM MAN	Well, well. Someone knows her cars.
F	MEGAN	I'm in the Firebird club.
M	TRANS AM MAN	You don't say. I never met a lady in the FBC before. He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie
F	MEGAN	You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton? Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They
F	BECCA	What's happening? What's happening?
M	DANA	I can hear animals.
F	BECCA	Be quiet! The guy is moving closer to Megan.
F	MEGAN	Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
M	TRANS AM MAN	It's my favorite movie. âGive me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.â He leans into her.
F	MEGAN	Why don't you show me what's under the hood? Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.
M	LESLIE	How's it comin'?
F	ANNIE	Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He
M	TRANS AM MAN	You wanna get in the backseat?
F	MEGAN	Uh... He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
M	MEGAN (CONT'D)	Hey take it easy! Hey what about me? He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by
M	DANA	Oh my God!! Annie is frantically releasing the jack.
F	ANNIE	OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan, Helen let's go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie
M	TRANS AM MAN	Hey you!
F	HELEN	Annie get in!
M	TRANS AM MAN	I'm gonna get you bitches!! He is coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with
F	ANNIE	Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out...your fucking..face!
M	TRANS AM MAN	Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I'm leaving.
F	ANNIE	Get out!
M	TRANS AM MAN	I am! I live up the hill though if you change your mind. Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away.
M	CONTINUOUS	The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.
M	LESLIE	Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up against you. That was a pretty gutsy move.
F	MEGAN	Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
F	ANNIE	Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	There it is, turn left up here. Go down the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway. It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM
M	LESLIE	God I haven't been here in forever.
F	ANNIE	The house is right up here. They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.
F	HELEN	Her car's not here.
M	DANA	Doesn't look like any lights are on.
F	BECCA	She's not here. Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
F	ANNIE	I thought she'd be here. I really thought she'd be here. I'm sorry.
M	DANA	Annie, it's ok.
F	ANNIE	No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent.
F	HELEN	Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because... I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that.
F	ANNIE	Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled
F	HELEN	I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a porn.
F	HELEN	Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
F	ANNIE	Oh, well, sorry.
F	HELEN	I deserved it.
F	ANNIE	I must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events.
F	HELEN	Well, I'm really rich. They smile.
F	ANNIE	It is getting pretty late.
M	DANA	What should we do about Lillian?
F	ANNIE	She'll come home when she's ready.
F	ANNIE	You okay?
F	LILLIAN	Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.
F	ANNIE	It's okay. I really am sorry.
F	LILLIAN	I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to turn out like this. I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect.
F	ANNIE	Well its easy to get caught up.
F	LILLIAN	And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother.
F	ANNIE	I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all talked and everythings cool.
F	HELEN	Really?!
F	ANNIE	Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow.
F	LILLIAN	She's really not so bad.
F	ANNIE	I know.
F	LILLIAN	I just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie. And now, it's become this thing I never wanted. I did want simple. I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to play all those stupid wedding songs.
F	ANNIE	It's not too late to have those things.
F	LILLIAN	I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you were going through too. Annie is clearly sad.
F	ANNIE	It's fine. I just feel really lost right Lillian hugs her.
F	LILLIAN	Nothing's going to change.
F	ANNIE	Oh God dont say that.
F	LILLIAN	I mean between you and me.
F	ANNIE	You want to come in? Steve's home. This could be your last chance as a single woman.
F	LILLIAN	Ooooo... The small paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in. Perry and Helen are dancing. They look like they are talking and working things out. He hugs her and kisses Lillian and Dougie dance into frame. They are very close. Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also.
M	STEVE	Thanks a lot for bringing me.
F	ANNIE	Thanks for coming with me. Megan appears on her other side.
F	MEGAN	Yeah, thanks for bringing him. Megan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to Annie is alone, watching everybody. We see the wedding as twinkly lights, food everywhere. Simple, fun...very
F	LILLIAN	So when does school start?
F	ANNIE	A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the oldest one there.
F	LILLIAN	So what? Now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross. They walk down the steps.
M	LILLIAN (CONT'D)	Thanks for everything today. Yo've been the best Maid of Honor ever.
F	ANNIE	Really?
F	LILLIAN	(kidding) MMM. No. That's not true at all. You were pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
F	ANNIE	Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel.
F	LILLIAN	You're always gonna be my best friend. They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.
F	ANNIE	I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs. Price! Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course. The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on the other side of it. Need a ride ma'am? It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen
F	ANNIE	How did you know I was here?
M	RHODES	It was really complicated. I remembered the name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles.
F	ANNIE	Wow. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
M	ANNIE (CONT'D)	So, did you get the moonpies?
M	RHODES	Yes I did.
F	ANNIE	Did you like' em?
M	RHODES	Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
F	ANNIE	Ooo, I didn't think about that.
M	RHODES	You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so... He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about Rhodes stops. I didn't want to miss my chance again. Me neither. They MAKE OUT. The end.
M	ALT ENDING	Annie is walking back to her hotel. A cop car pulls up Need a ride ma'am? She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.
F	ANNIE	How did you know I was here?
M	RHODES	I'm a cop. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
F	ANNIE	So, did you get the moonpies?
M	RHODES	Yes I did.
F	ANNIE	Did you like' em?
M	RHODES	Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
F	ANNIE	Ooo, I didn't think about that.
M	RHODES	The real reason I came here today is that I have something that belongs to you. He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles.
