M	Revised Draft	On complete darkness. A SMALL DOOR swings open. A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a But an invisible force descends. The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s SEBASTIAN Damnit. Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a Damnit. Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a SEBASTIAN I am a goddamn genius. He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on Digital phone rings. In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a
F	LINDA	Sebastian, do you know what time it is? You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it was waste of time. LINDA What is it this time? INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer SEBASTIAN Who s that? Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer
F	LINDA	Not your business. Not anymore. SEBASTIAN Touche. LINDA So you calling about anything in particular, or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude?
F	SEBASTIAN	I cracked the reversion. Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
F	LINDA	You cracked it?
F	SEBASTIAN	Look at this. Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the
F	SEBASTIAN	Watch this.
F	LINDA	You sure? SEBASTIAN 91% sure. LINDA Eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How? SEBASTIAN The usual. Coffee and twinkies. LINDA I hate you.
F	SEBASTIAN	I know. You think you could hunt down Matt and get to the lab early. I want Isabelle prepped for a live test.
F	LINDA	Yeah, I think I can find him. What are you going to do? SEBASTIAN Well y know. It s daylight in Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our prizes ready. See you in a few. ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda
F	LINDA	Hey... come on. DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under MATT What?
F	LINDA	Sebastian just called. We gotta get to the lab. Matt bolts up.
M	MATT	Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, did you?
F	LINDA	Give me some credit, will ya. MATT So what s the rush? LINDA He cracked reversion. Matt pulls his jeans on. MATT Wanna ride down? LINDA We better take our own cars. MATT You re gonna have to tell him about us eventually.
F	LINDA	I know. It s just You re his best friend. He ll feel betrayed. From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space
M	MARINE GUARD	Morning, sir. SEBASTIAN Morning, Ed. MARINE GUARD Your team s in early. Something special going on?
F	SEBASTIAN	Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN Clearance: ALPHA ALPHA THREE Division: CLASSIFIED The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
M	MARINE GUARD	Have a good day, sir. Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian Authorization please.
F	SEBASTIAN	Caine zero zero two seven. ELEVATOR (V.0.) Authorization verified. Good morning, Dr. Caine. The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas THUMP. The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES MATT Isabelle ... The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the Calm down baby. Calm down. It s okay... Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not going to hurt you. Come here. THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs Just hold still. Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. Ow, shit. Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies
F	LINDA	You okay? MATT She bit me. LINDA Yeah. She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days. Linda takes the goggles from Matt. Go take care of that bite. I ll get her. MATT And give you a chance to pull ahead? Never. Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and
M	AROUND THE CORNER	A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner,
M	MATT	Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting simians. heheheheh. LINDA Knock it off. Isabelle! THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at
M	MATT	Good shootin , Tex. LINDA What s that make it? MATT I m still ahead. 6 to 5. Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from LINDA But I m catching up. The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met
F	SARAH	Can I have a word?
F	SEBASTIAN	Most normal people say good morning.
F	SARAH	Don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle?
F	SEBASTIAN	How many tissue samples have we successfully regressed? Hundreds, right? How many have gone on to work on the full system? None. SARAH That s beside the point. SEBASTIAN No, that is the point. I m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. This thing works. I know it. I feel it. Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail SARAH Fine. You can mop up afterward.
F	SEBASTIAN	You think I m going to kill Isabelle? SARAH Kill? More like liquefy. SEBASTIAN Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but I m the project leader. Understand? She says ... Yes, Sir. ... but somehow it feels like Fuck you. She storms off. SEBASTIAN How did you ever convince me to hire her? LINDA You said you wanted the beat vet in the country. SEBASTIAN Yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research. LINDA Maybe that s why she s so good. CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID. Sebastian peers at the vial. SEBASTIAN Who da Man? You da Man.
M	MATT	As we pull out we see we are. Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech MATT Protocol is hot. SEBASTIAN Vitals? Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, SARAH Normal. CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in BOOMING VOICE THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY. GOD HAS SPOKEN.
F	SEBASTIAN	How many times do I have to tell you, Frank you aren t God. I am. Sorry, Boss. Forgot. Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the SEBASTIAN You guys ready to roll? FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE
M	FRANK	We are live and in color. On your mark. Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. SEBASTIAN Okay. Roll em.
F	JANICE	Okay. We are rolling record on videos one through twelve. Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a Frank s voice echoes through the chamber. Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in phase shift... one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours. LINDA Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting serial protein Caine One Two Five. Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a MATT Maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself, you d have better luck.
F	SEBASTIAN	Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen scientific observation. I ll be sure to include it in my memoirs. MATT A whole mention? And I thought I was just gonna be a footnote. Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into
M	MATT	Okay. Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals. Tension in the air. SEBASTIAN Ready. She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it LINDA Propped.
M	MATT	Let s make some history. Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the SEBASTIAN Nice try, Sparky. Matt relinquishes the needle.
F	LINDA	Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The
F	SARAH	Elevated heartbeat. Janice analyzes the screens.
F	JANICE	We re still in the green. FRANK Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal range. The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex MATT It s reacting. Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes SEBASTIAN Do you see this? LINDA It s working. It s actually working. Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to
F	SARAH	Heart rate s up. She s scared. Sarah soothes her. It's okay, baby. It's okay. SEBASTIAN Subject began manifesting almost Immediately. Protocol is reacting quickly. Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She LINDA Subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort.
F	SARAH	Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. Brain activity going through the roof. We ve got a problem. SEBASTIAN What? What problem! Sarah checks her monitors. SARAH It s her heart. We can see the heart beating in the ape s FRANK (V.0.) I got an erratic heart beat. SARAH She s going into cardiac arrest. LINDA Got the crash cart. Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in. SARAH We re losing her. Her machine flatlines. SEBASTIAN No! It s got to work. The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in
F	LINDA	Clear! Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt
F	SARAH	We ve got something! The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its Still. erratic.
F	LINDA	Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do it. You can fucking do it. Everybody s pulling for her.
F	SARAH	Come on, monkey. MATT Do it. Do it. Come on. Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists SARAH Stabilizing. The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as FRANK (V.0.) Brain activity returning to normal. The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda LINDA Welcome back, Isabelle. Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move
F	SEBASTIAN	How is she?
F	SARAH	I think she s gonna be okay
M	CARTER	Amazing. She's normal, absolutely healthy. If you didn't know any better, you'd think nothing had happened to her.
M	MATT	Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways.
F	SARAH	Screw you, Matt.
M	MATT	Well maybe not right away.
F	LINDA	We should celebrate.
F	SEBASTIAN	To the finest research team I've ever known.
F	SEBASTIAN	Hey...
F	LINDA	I thought you'd gone.
F	SEBASTIAN	Where would I go? Twenty years ago there were no computers, no fax machines, no cell phones. I was just wondering what the world will be like twenty years from now... if what we're doing will change everything.
F	LINDA	A little "I am become death... the shatterer of worlds"?
F	SEBASTIAN	Something like that.
F	LINDA	Since the day I met, all you wanted to do was change the world.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Listen, I know we've... I mean... well ... I just want you to know how proud I am of you. I know it probably doesn't mean a lot...
F	SEBASTIAN	Actually it does. I guess since you were there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet.
F	LINDA	You're positively maudlin. You should be happy. Do you have any idea what you've accomplished?
F	SEBASTIAN	Yeah... but I was working so hard, I didn't realize I'd have no one to share it with.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	I don't suppose we could turn back the clock for a night and you could come home with me? Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.
M	MATT	What was that about?
F	LINDA	Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. Sometimes I just have to be reminded.
F	SEBASTIAN	What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell me what it's like!
M	SEBASTIAN (V.0.)	Six years ago, this committee commissioned me with a very specific task...
F	SEBASTIAN	To successful phase-shift a human being out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him safely, with no after affects.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Well, we found out sending them to "never-never-land" was easy, it's the getting back that's hard.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Every time we've tried to bring a test subject back from phase-shift. Cellular bonds would dissolve, the primary DNA strands would decay. But now...
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	But now...
M	KRAMER	But now? But now... But now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue. We've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising. A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.
M	GENERAL	How long?
F	SEBASTIAN	Sir?
M	GENERAL	Son, as you can imagine, we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset. How long till you resolve this issue?
F	SEBASTIAN	Shouldn't be more than another year, Sir.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Maybe sooner.
M	MATT	Yo. Reality check! What the hell was that about?
F	SEBASTIAN	Keep your voice down.
M	MATT	The protocol works. Why'd you tell them it didn't?
F	SEBASTIAN	I wasn't ready for them to know.
M	MATT	But they're the oversight committee. They're supposed to know.
F	LINDA	I'm sure he had a reason. You did have a reason, didn't you, Sebastian?
F	SEBASTIAN	I had more than a reason. I had a goddamn epiphany. What do you think they'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again? How many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project, bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on. We'd have lost control of it by the end of the week.
F	LINDA	It's their money, Sebastian. It's going to happen eventually.
F	SEBASTIAN	I know. But not yet. There's too much for us to learn. I don't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three.
M	MATT	Well, then... mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding out?
F	SEBASTIAN	That's easy. I've decided to test the procedure ...
F	SEBASTIAN	... on myself.
M	FRANK	Are you nuts?
F	SEBASTIAN	Was Jonas Salk nuts?
M	FRANK	Yeah. Pretty sure he was.
M	CARTER	And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died.
F	SEBASTIAN	If we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else?
F	JANICE	Isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway?
F	SARAH	She's right. We haven't even finished collating the phase two research.
F	SEBASTIAN	We'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later. Monkey data doesn't matter anyway. The only real data is human data.
F	SARAH	You don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans.
F	SEBASTIAN	How are we gonna find out? Besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their DNA is 98% the same as humans. And the 2% is not that significant.
F	LINDA	Sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. Gorilla's live in trees. That's a helluva 2% if you ask me.
F	SEBASTIAN	We're all concerned. I know that. But if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do.
F	LINDA	Why you? Why not one of us?
F	SEBASTIAN	The risks. I couldn't ask...
M	MATT	What if we volunteer?
F	LINDA	What if you're too valuable to lose?
F	SEBASTIAN	I'm Project Leader. It's my formula and my call. The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work. I'll want about four weeks to...
M	FRANK	To put your affairs in order?
F	SEBASTIAN	To run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. I'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression.
F	SEBASTIAN	Come in. What?
F	LINDA	In the past six years, I've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... Sebastian. I don't think you should do this.
F	SEBASTIAN	You don't understand.
F	LINDA	Oh please. How long were we together? You must've said it a million times ... Nobody knows who built the lunar lander. All they remember in the first man on the moon. But what if something happens to you... what about the project?
F	SEBASTIAN	Lin, trust me... nothing's going to happen.
F	LINDA	He refuses to listen to reason.
M	MATT	Can we talk about this later? I'm trying to make love to you.
F	LINDA	Sorry. I just can't let it go.
M	MATT	I know how you're feeling. Hell, he and I've been friends since freshman year.
F	LINDA	So how can we let him do this?
M	MATT	What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,Mars, would you go?
F	LINDA	In a heartbeat.
M	MATT	What if they didn't know whether or not they could get you home? This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I were him I'd do the same thing.
F	LINDA	Let me ask another question.
M	MATT	Is about who gets to be on top?
F	LINDA	Is the human race really ready for what we're doing?
M	MATT	Why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical?
F	LINDA	No really. Is it ready? We're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that I don't think we can answer.
M	MATT	They said the same thing about the bomb. They said we'd never survive the nuclear age... but here we are.
F	LINDA	This night is still young. I mean, when you think about it, it's creepy. Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye?
M	MATT	We made our deal with the devil years ago. Might as well stick around to cash in.
F	SEBASTIAN	Yes?
M	MATT	We're ready.
F	SEBASTIAN	Okay.
M	MATT	It's not too late to back out. I'm happy to take your place.
F	SEBASTIAN	No. I'm ready.
M	MATT	Nervous?
F	SEBASTIAN	A little.
M	MATT	Ever tell you the one about Superman and Wonder Woman?
F	SEBASTIAN	I don't think so.
M	MATT	So Superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell. Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League. I mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. So Superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. I could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." After all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. Well ... I tell ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "What the hell was that." And the Invisible Man replies "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell."
F	SEBASTIAN	You know, that could be the last joke I ever hear.
M	MATT	C'mon, man. That's funny shit.
F	LINDA	O.K. How're you feeling?
F	SEBASTIAN	Fine.
F	SARAH	Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit elevated.
F	SEBASTIAN	To be expected.
F	SARAH	No reason for concern. He's ready.
F	SEBASTIAN	Hey... it's gonna be okay.
F	LINDA	Start recording.
F	JANICE	We're hot. All systems nominal, Houston.
M	FRANK	Okay, kids. Let's make some history.
F	LINDA	Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs.
M	MATT	Ready. If the tests are any indication it should work quickly.
F	SEBASTIAN	I'll inject myself. If anything goes wrong, they can't blame you.
F	LINDA	We can still shut down, Sebastian.
M	MATT	Any last words?
F	SEBASTIAN	Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said something deep and clever.
F	LINDA	Injection was administered at Keep talking. Tell us what you're feeling.
F	SEBASTIAN	Nothing so far.
F	SARAH	Vitals are stable.
F	LINDA	Nothing's happening.
M	MATT	Human DNA structure is slightly more complex... it's possible that it may take more time...
F	LINDA	Maybe we overlooked something.
F	SEBASTIAN	Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- reactive.
M	CARTER	Kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse... Don't know if it'll go off.
F	LINDA	Frank?
M	FRANK (V.0.)	No change in bio-electric.
F	SEBASTIAN	Goddammit. Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's starting to tingle... Okay... it's spreading to my back... like, like a fever...
F	LINDA	Here we go.
F	SEBASTIAN	Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh god. It hurts. I didn't think it would hurt.
F	SARAH	Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.
F	LINDA	What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP TALKING!
F	SEBASTIAN	Pain!
F	SARAH	Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 180 over 100. ...
M	CARTER	He's going to blow out his heart.
F	LINDA	Prop the crash cart.
M	MATT	We've got to stop it!
F	LINDA	We can't!
F	JANICE	Something's happening.
M	FRANK	Listen up! Electric activity increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves are through the roof.
F	JANICE	I didn't think the human brain could spike that high.
M	FRANK	Maybe it can't.
F	SEBASTIAN	No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!
F	SARAH	Pulse is 180 .... holding stable.
M	CARTER	Holy shit.
F	SARAH	Pulse is dropping. 170..
F	LINDA	Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
M	MATT	Is he dead?
F	LINDA	No. He passed out from the trauma.
F	SARAH	Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 ... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over
M	FRANK (V.O.)	Electrical activity is stabilizing.
F	SARAH	Pulse steady at 70.
M	MATT	Un-fucking-believable.
F	LINDA	You did it, Sebastian. You're the first.
M	CARTER	Let's get him into recovery.
M	MATT	S'okay. You nodded off.
F	LINDA	His breathing's hypnotic. How long's it been?
M	MATT	Seventeen hours.
F	LINDA	Where are the others?
M	MATT	In the lab crunching numbers. We've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research.
F	LINDA	I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there. Did you see...
M	MATT	He may be coming out of it.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights! Ah Christ! I can't... I can't close my eyes. I can't close my eyes.
F	LINDA	Your eyelids are transparent.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	So I ... I'm...
F	LINDA	Yes.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel them...
F	LINDA	Your arms ... your whole body... It worked, Sebastian. It worked.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Mirror. I ... I want to see.
M	MATT	Over here in the corner. What was it like?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I ... It's hard to think.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	The transformation... I remember every molecule in my body shattering.
M	MATT	It was painful?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	At first... but then everything went black. I couldn't see or hear or feel anything. It was all just black... like I wasn't connected.
F	LINDA	Your system received quite a shock.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	At least my senses are starting to return... You're wearing your Shalimar, aren't you?
F	LINDA	Sebastian.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	This is weird. I'm looking through myself at the floor. I'm looking right through myself. I can't tell ... ... where my body is.
F	LINDA	Sebastian?
M	MATT	Sebastian?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You really can't see me. Can you?
F	LINDA	Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, headache, body-ache, disorientation.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	No, just tired. It's funny. I can see everything... more than before... but I can't see myself.
M	CARTER	Hey. How's he doing?
F	LINDA	Why don't you ask him?
F	SARAH	Sebastian, how do you feel.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Not to bad, considering.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	Odd, isn't it?
F	LINDA	He can't close his eyes so they're sensitive to light.
F	JANICE	So, what was it like?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Over here.
F	LINDA	C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Sorry. Couldn't resist.
M	FRANK	I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.
M	MATT	Well, I see the procedure hasn't changed your personality.
M	FRANK	No worries. I'm on it.
M	FRANK (cont'd)	Gotcha, big man.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Boy, you people have no sense of humor. Show me. So ...
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Stop there.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	Index that. That was when it started burn. Epidermal reaction.
F	JANICE	Index Mark. 112125.
F	LINDA	It's late. Time you got some rest.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Just a little longer.
F	LINDA	Hate to pull rank, but you're my patient now and you need rest. We've got a busy day tomorrow.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Fine.
F	LINDA	We've set up a thermal camera for observation and I've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything. The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If anything goes wrong, we can all be here within...
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote the procedure.
F	LINDA	I was trying to be reassuring.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You like this don't you?
F	LINDA	What's that?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Being in charge.
F	LINDA	Please. I'm just doing my job.
F	LINDA	You gonna be okay?
F	SARAH	Fine. It's not like I have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life.
F	LINDA	Carter'll be in at six to spell you and I'll be in by nine. Call me if anything happens, okay?
F	SARAH	I'm fine. Go on ahead.
M	CARTER	Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.
F	LINDA	Days only get longer from here.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Sarah. Are you awake?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	Hmm.
F	SARAH	Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are you in here? Dr. Caine?
M	SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)	Dr. Caine, please report in.
M	SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)	Dr. Caine, report in please!
F	SARAH	Shit.
M	SARAH (cont'd)	Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this isn't funny. I know you're in here. I must be going crazy.
F	SARAH	I found him later in the lab, running samples.
F	LINDA	Why didn't you call me?
F	SARAH	Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. I mean, I could've easily been dreaming.
M	MATT	It doesn't sound like something Sebastian would do.
F	SARAH	God, I feel so stupid.
F	LINDA	I can talk to him.
F	SARAH	No. I mean... It was probably nothing. I shouldn't've mentioned it.
M	MATT	You sure?
F	SARAH	Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why would he do that, right? Just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know.
M	MATT	So, how was your first night?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes.
M	MATT	Yeah? What'd you do?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Got up a couple of times. Knocked about.
M	MATT	Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. She said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond.
F	SEBASTIAN	I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio on.
M	MATT	It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. I mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you.
F	SEBASTIAN	I didn't think it was a problem.
M	MATT	It isn't. I just don't want it to become one.
M	MATT (cont'd)	Readings are normal.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Next I want to run a VV and UVF analysis of the platelets.
M	MATT	We'll have to draw some more blood.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You okay?
F	SARAH	Yeah. Why?
F	SEBASTIAN	You just seem a little nervous.
F	SARAH	No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This might hurt a bit. Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, but are you... are you looking at me.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	No. I was looking at the clock. Why?
F	SARAH	Just felt like someone was staring at me.
F	LINDA	Sebastian? Goddamnit.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You've no idea how much fun I've had. I'm going to hate going back.
F	LINDA	That's what worries me.?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	How so?
F	LINDA	What happens when we turn the project over to the Army. Ever wonder how much fun they're gonna have?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Maybe we won't give it to them. His voice comes from behind her now. I was thinking... tonight's my last night. Ever fantasize about making love to an invisible man?
F	LINDA	Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Well, don't do it for me. Do it for science.
F	LINDA	Grow up.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Oh well. Missed your big chance.
F	LINDA	Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.
F	LINDA	Recording?
M	FRANK	Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian Caine. Currently in phase shift... Three days, seven hours.
F	LINDA	De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial Protein Caine One Two Seven. Ready?
F	SEBASTIAN	Not really. I was just starting to enjoy myself.
F	LINDA	Tough.
M	MATT	Okay, man. Here we go.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Wait... something... something doesn't feel right.
F	SARAH	Heartbeat elevated.
M	FRANK	Vitals still nominal..
F	SEBASTIAN	I can't br... br...
F	LINDA	What's wrong?
F	SARAH	He's not breathing.
M	MATT	Subject manifesting.
F	SARAH	Pulse erratic.
F	LINDA	Carter! Sebastian! Sebastian! Sebastian!
M	MATT	Get a tranq. Stat.
F	LINDA	He's reverting. Got him on the table. Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.
F	SARAH	I got no pulse. No pulse.
M	MATT	Start CPR.
M	CARTER	Getting a pulse.
M	MATT	Holy shit. What happened?
F	LINDA	Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you hear me? How are his pupils?
M	MATT	I can't see his goddamn pupils!
F	SARAH	I think he's going into shock.
M	FADE	ON:
M	MATT	Just got the tissue sample results. Cellular cohesion is stable. How bout you? You gonna be okay?
F	LINDA	Guess so. I was just thinking about the Apollo missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and Chaffee... What it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death.
M	MATT	Sometimes the test pilots make history. Sometimes the planes crash and people die.
F	LINDA	But he didn't die, did he? What if we can't bring him back? What then?
M	MATT	It's just a little hitch is all. He'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and I'm sure he will. It'll just take time. Listen, let's got out of here. We could drive up to the old observatory. We'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile.
F	LINDA	No. I want to be here for him.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Hey...
F	LINDA	Hey...
F	SEBASTIAN	So I guess it didn't work.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You look worried. It must've been bad.
F	LINDA	You almost died.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger.
F	LINDA	I should be making you feel better. Not vice versa.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I guess if I'm going to be stuck this way for awhile, I'd better make some adjustments.
M	MATT	Not too bad.
F	SEBASTIAN	The latex'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves.
F	LINDA	You could almost pass for human.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again.
F	SEBASTIAN	The testing's making me sick.
F	LINDA	Could be the barium or the radiation.
M	MATT	You're physiology has changed and, well, all bets are off.
F	SEBASTIAN	I can't believe I have to spend another night here. Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet up with that boyfriend of yours now.
F	LINDA	Do you want me to stay?
F	SEBASTIAN	No. That's okay. It's just, being a guinea pig is more work than I thought. I'll be fine.
M	CARTER	Dr. Caine. What's up?
F	SEBASTIAN	Just stopped by to let you know, I'm going out for a bit.
M	CARTER	Going out? Hey wait a sec!
M	CARTER	What do you mean going out for a bit?
F	SEBASTIAN	If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna go crazy.
M	CARTER	But you're not supposed to leave the compound.
F	SEBASTIAN	Why not?
M	CARTER	That's the rule.
F	SEBASTIAN	Yes, but I made that rule. It's my rule and I'm changing it.
M	CARTER	You can't just change it.
F	SEBASTIAN	Carter, I was suppose to be like this for three days. Three fucking days and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going out. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay?
M	CARTER	Shit.
M	CARTER	Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.
M	MARINE GUARD	Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile?
F	SEBASTIAN	Yeah, well. You know how it in sometimes.
M	MARINE GUARD	You got that right, sir. I was beginning to worry 'cause your car hadn't moved.
F	SEBASTIAN	Thanks, but everything's cool.
M	MATT	He could be anywhere. Hell he could be right behind us.
F	LINDA	I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna swing by his place, just in case.
M	MATT	See you there.
F	LINDA	I don't want him to see.
M	MATT	What a mess.
F	SEBASTIAN	Shit. Don't even think it... Once...just once.
F	LINDA	Sebastian?
F	LINDA	Sebastian?
F	LINDA	Oh shit.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. He's taken his make-up off. I don't know...He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went. I'm coming back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! We're going on alpha call. I want everyone at the lab now. We're gonna need thermal visors and we may need tranqs.
F	JANICE	What are the tranqs for?
F	LINDA	Use your imagination.
F	JANICE	Are you saying he's dangerous?
M	MATT	We're just saying we need to be cautious.
F	LINDA	The Metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far.
M	CARTER	Look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't you think you're over reacting?
F	LINDA	This program is classified. If he's out there it means someone might find out about him. He could destroy the whole program.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out.
M	MATT	Where the hell have you been?
F	SEBASTIAN	I got a little stir crazy, so I went to my apartment to pick up some stuff.
F	LINDA	Bullshit! I went to your apartment and I happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up.
F	SEBASTIAN	What are you talking about?
F	LINDA	You, of all people How could you? You put yourself and this project at risk.
F	SEBASTIAN	Just what did you see in my apartment?
F	LINDA	I saw your face and your clothes.
M	MATT	It was bad enough you left without an escort, but to take off the... out in public?
F	SEBASTIAN	Don't make a mountain out of molehill. I didn't let anyone see me.
F	LINDA	That's not good enough. When you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. It's just not safe for you to be out there.
F	SEBASTIAN	Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to be some kind of prisoner.
F	LINDA	You volunteered for this, Sebastian. You knew going in there could be consequences. For the security of this project, I'm gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound.
F	SEBASTIAN	I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's my decision to make.
F	LINDA	You're right. It's your decision. But if you leave the compound again, I'll notify the oversight committee. Then they can make the decision. You understand?
F	SEBASTIAN	Matt?
M	MATT	Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it were the other way around.
F	LINDA	Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.
F	LINDA	Hold still.
F	SEBASTIAN	How much blood do you think you've taken so far?
F	LINDA	Not enough to worry about.
F	SEBASTIAN	Every day... feels like you're sucking me dry. It's funny. All these years I've known you, I never pegged you for a megalomanic.
F	LINDA	What are you talking about?
F	SEBASTIAN	The shoe being on the other foot. You getting to run things.
F	LINDA	I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone's gotta run the show. Look, I know how hard this has been for you.
F	SEBASTIAN	Don't patronize me. And for the record, you've got no idea what it's like. I get up every morning and you people stick needles in me. You bombard me with radiation until I vomit. And then at six it's over for you. You get to go home. But Sebastian is still here. Sebastian can't leave, or else. That's the worst part, you know. Here I have this ... this GIFT and I can't even use it.
F	LINDA	Now it's a gift?
F	SEBASTIAN	You're goddamn right it's a gift. And if you weren't so goddamned short sighted, I'd be out there right now trying to master it.
F	LINDA	Where're you going?
F	SEBASTIAN	Looks like I'm going nowhere.
M	MATT	Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests scheduled today.
F	SEBASTIAN	Do them yourself.
F	LINDA	Want to talk about it?
F	SEBASTIAN	No.
F	LINDA	"We are the hollow men, the stuffed men, headpieces filled with straw."
F	SEBASTIAN	Funny, huh? I've become a literal metaphor.
F	LINDA	I don't want to fight you. I just want what's best for the program.
F	SEBASTIAN	I know. And you being right doesn't make it any easier for me.
F	LINDA	You can be scared. That's okay.
F	SEBASTIAN	I'm not scared of being stuck this way. With a little more make-up and practice, I could... ... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. But the testing...
F	LINDA	You're talking like you've given up. It's only been a few months.
F	SEBASTIAN	What if it's years? I don't know how much more testing I can take.
M	MATT	60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...
F	SEBASTIAN	We've got it. We've got it.
M	MATT	
F	LINDA	That's all we need.
F	SEBASTIAN	Come on, baby. Come on.
M	MATT	Full quantum cascade at 95%. I'm sorry.
F	SEBASTIAN	You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? Six weeks of this shit and you're sorry!
F	JANICE	I don't blame him.
F	LINDA	I'll go talk to him.
M	MATT	Leave him alone. He just needs to blow off some steam.
M	FRANK (V.0.)	Yeah?
F	SEBASTIAN	I'm going to the lab.
M	FRANK (V.0.)	Don't you sleep?
F	SEBASTIAN	Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.
M	FRANK	Okay. I'm here if you need me.
M	MATT	How'd it go?
M	FRANK	Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 10:30 and then went to sleep.
F	SEBASTIAN	Ah, my two favorite people. Good morning.
F	LINDA	Good morning.
M	MATT	Why so cheery this morning?
F	SEBASTIAN	You know some days you just wake up feeling the world is full of potential. Like your eyes have been opened.
M	MATT	I'm happy if I make it to my coffee machine.
F	LINDA	I restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand. Thought you might want to take look.
F	SEBASTIAN	Cook up a batch and let's see where we go.
F	LINDA	I thought you'd want to take a look at it.
F	SEBASTIAN	I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to have my head examined.
F	LINDA	I'm telling you, I know him. Something's going on.
M	MATT	Think he knows about us.
F	LINDA	If he knew about us, he'd be angry and that wasn't angry.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	When you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible?
M	CARTER	Sure... all the time.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	What did you imagine you'd do?
M	CARTER	The usual.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	What's the usual?
M	CARTER	Hanging out in the girl's locker room.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Jimmy Margiani?
M	CARTER	School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. Back then, I was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Ever think up anything along the grand scale?
M	CARTER	Sure. World domination. Manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base. But those are more recent fantasies.
F	SEBASTIAN	And what if it weren't fantasy? What if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever. How far would go? I mean... if it were real?
M	CARTER	I don't know, man. Out in the real world... I mean, there's a responsibility...
F	SEBASTIAN	Let's say you saw a woman with amazing tits. Would you brush against them?
M	CARTER	Hell, I try and do that now.
F	SEBASTIAN	Human nature. So if you could get away with more, would you do more?
M	CARTER	I read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "Would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% said yes.
F	SEBASTIAN	Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder if the world's ready for what we're doing.
M	CARTER	So, Doc what did you do?
F	SEBASTIAN	What do you mean?
M	CARTER	When you were out.
F	SEBASTIAN	I just walked around. Y'know.
M	CARTER	Aw, you just walked around? Come on. There's more, right?
F	SEBASTIAN	Like what?
M	CARTER	Man, I'd be walking up to people saying shit like "This is God, go,get a haircut." Or hanging out in the changing room at Victoria's Secret.
F	SEBASTIAN	Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. Besides, it was late and I wasn't out that long.
M	CARTER	Well, did you see anybody?
F	SEBASTIAN	There was this one girl.
M	CARTER	Yeah? And did you mess with her?
F	SEBASTIAN	Naw...
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Well maybe a little. I tell you though, a man could get used to it.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Goodnight.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.
F	LINDA	It's fine. I just didn't know you were there. Goodnight.
F	LINDA	What was it?
M	MATT	I don't know. I don't see anything. It's like something hit it.
M	CARTER	Hello?
M	CARTER (cont'd)	No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at
F	LINDA	Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye. Phew.
M	MATT	Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Be quiet! And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is it who blinds me?" and Odysseus replied "Nobody is my name". And the Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody is killing me. Nobody".
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
F	SARAH	You awake?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I am now.
F	SARAH	Notice anything unusual last night.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	No. Why?
F	SARAH	Franklin Three. He's dead.
F	SEBASTIAN	What of?
F	SARAH	His neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	How'd that happen?
F	SARAH	I thought maybe you could tell me.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Sarah... You saying I had something to do with it?
F	SARAH	He was alive last night when I left and he was dead this morning. And you were the only one down here.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I was in my room all night.
M	CARTER	That's all twelve hours.
F	LINDA	He never left the room.
F	SARAH	A windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse. Someone or something killed it.
M	MATT	You saw the tape. The man was in his chamber.
F	SARAH	Then we have a problem, because I the cage was locked from the outside. That means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again. Only a human could do that.
M	CARTER	Well, it wasn't me.
M	MATT	And it wasn't him.
F	LINDA	Are we sure?
F	SEBASTIAN	Any big plans for tonight?
F	LINDA	Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.
F	SEBASTIAN	Really? Whatever happened to that guy your were seeing?
F	LINDA	He's still in the picture. Why?
F	SEBASTIAN	Being locked down here, I'm forced to live vicariously. Someday you'll have to tell me what he's like.
F	LINDA	Maybe someday I will. See you in the morning.
F	SEBASTIAN	Au domain.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Hmmm.
F	LINDA	Forgot something.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	What the hell?
M	FRANK	Pretty clever really. All it does is recycle the signal. He flips this switch, it takes a snapshot and that's all we see.
F	LINDA	Asshole.
F	JANICE	And you think he's violent?
F	SARAH	He killed a dog with his bare hands.
M	FRANK	Dogs aren't people. Are we in any danger?
F	LINDA	Either way, we aren't equipped to handle this. We have to inform the committee.
F	JANICE	What if he doesn't come back?
F	LINDA	They'll go after him. Who has tonight's shift?
F	JANICE	I do.
F	LINDA	Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just do what you're doing so he doesn't become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot the committee deal with it.
M	KRAMER	I'll call General Caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow.
F	LINDA	Thank you, sir.
M	MATT	What do we do in the meantime?
M	KRAMER	Just sit tight and wait for my call.
M	MRS. KRAMER	What was that about?
M	KRAMER	Just a little trouble at work.
M	MRS. KRAMER	You coming up?
M	KRAMER	In a minute. I have to make a few calls. Hello? Hello?
M	KRAMER	Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	What? No good morning for me? Don't you like me anymore?
F	LINDA	Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	That's okay. It's going to be busy day.
F	LINDA	When did he say held call?
M	MATT	He's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do.
F	LINDA	I'm gonna call him.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me? When? I'm so sorry.
M	MATT	What?
F	LINDA	He's dead. Drowned in his pool last night.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Yes, General Thompson please. Thank you.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Hello? Hello?
M	MATT	Let me see that. Intercom's working, but there doesn't seem to be an outside line.
F	LINDA	I'll be right back with help.
M	ELEVATOR (V.0.)	Authorization please.
F	LINDA	Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.
M	ELEVATOR (V.0.)	Authorization invalid. Request denied.
F	LINDA	That's a first.
M	ELEVATOR (V.0.)	Authorization please.
F	LINDA	Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.
M	ELEVATOR (V.0.)	Authorization invalid. Request denied.
M	MATT	Let me try mine.
M	ELEVATOR (V.0.)	Authorization please.
M	MATT	Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine.
M	ELEVATOR (V.0.)	Authorization invalid. Request denied.
F	LINDA	Tell me this isn't happening.
F	LINDA	We've got a problem.
M	MATT	How long before anybody starts looking for us?
F	LINDA	There's no set check in procedure. It could be weeks.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	You think you can got in?
M	FRANK	Already in. It was only a second level encryption.
F	JANICE	Some security system.
M	FRANK	Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm just extraordinary. But apparently someone is more extraordinary than me.
M	MATT	What is it?
M	FRANK	There's nothing wrong with the system. Our codes have been removed.
M	MATT	Removed? By who?
M	FRANK	Here's a clue. Only one code remains.
F	LINDA	Whose?
M	FRANK	Dr. Sebastian Caine.
M	CARTER	He's not in there.
F	LINDA	Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us where you are.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me in.
F	LINDA	Sebastian... where are you?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)	You have no idea what it's like. The power of it. The freedom. I can't let that go.
F	LINDA	C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. Tell me where you are and we can talk about it.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)	There's nothing to talk about. See ... I've done things that can't be undone.
F	LINDA	Sebastian! Sebastian! I want search parties. Thermal goggles and tranquilizers.
F	JANICE	Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I'm here.
M	FRANK	Doctor Caine?
F	LINDA	Sebastian?
M	MATT	This is bad.
F	LINDA	There's something over there. Jesus. Oh my god.
M	MATT	What happened?
F	LINDA	She was strangled. Multiple blows to her head.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	We got a big problem here. Get everybody to the conference room. Now!
M	MATT	Intercom... the phone lines. They're dead.
F	LINDA	Gimme that.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	It was just working.
M	MATT	What the fuck is going on here?
M	MATT	What?
F	LINDA	Shhh.
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Give me the visor. C'mon.
M	FRANK	Did you find him?
F	LINDA	Janice is dead.
F	LINDA	It's clear.
F	SARAH	The man has checked out of reality.
M	FRANK	What happened? I don't understand.
M	CARTER	Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the only ones who knows he exists. If he gets rid of us, no one knows and he becomes the most powerful man on earth.
M	FRANK	But he's not a killer.
F	LINDA	He wasn't. He is now.
M	MATT	Can you fix the elevator? Restore our codes?
M	FRANK	It'd take hours to crack the encryptions.
M	MATT	Right now that sounds like good news.
M	CARTER	So what do we do until then. Sit around waiting for him to kill us off?
F	LINDA	No. We find him, before he finds us.
M	CARTER	You sure this'll work.
F	LINDA	We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one. They were too small for thermal scans.
M	MATT	Systems hot. Activating motion detectors.
F	LINDA	I've got movement in Corridor Six.
M	MATT	That's him.
M	MATT	Got 'em.
F	LINDA	Check. Check. Be careful.
M	MATT	Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, ready?
M	CARTER	Let's do it.
F	LINDA	Take a right at the next accessway. He's working his way back to the offices.
M	MATT	If we split up, can we trap him on corridor eight?
M	LINDA (V.0.)	If he keeps heading in that direction.
M	MATT	Going Thermal.
F	LINDA	I lost him. Matt, I lost him.
M	MATT	He probably just stopped moving.
M	CARTER	It's me.
M	MATT	Do you have anything?
M	CARTER	Nothing.
M	MATT	How did he get by us?
M	CARTER	He couldn't.
M	MATT	Sebastian! We're here to help. Sebastian.
M	CARTER	There. Behind those pipes. He's not moving. Doctor Caine? Can you hear me?
M	MATT	We see him. But he's not responding. The heat signature doesn't move.
M	MATT	C'mon... C'mon...
M	CARTER	Covered.
M	MATT	What the...
M	MATT (cont'd)	Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent
M	LINDA (V.0.)	He was there.
M	MATT	Looks like... looks like we're pumping out heat...
M	LINDA (V.0.)	I got movement again! He's right on top of you!
M	MATT	No fucking shit!
M	MATT (cont'd)	Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.
M	CARTER	H...Help... MMmmphg
M	MATT	Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?
F	LINDA	Right on top of you.
M	LINDA (V.0.)	What's going on? Are you okay?
M	MATT	Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from a head wound.
F	LINDA	Matt, he's coming toward you.
M	MATT	Shit.
F	LINDA	Got outta there.
F	LINDA	He's close!
M	MATT	Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's shutting me in. Where is he?
F	LINDA	He's coming right at you!
M	MATT	Where?
F	LINDA	Twenty, maybe thirty feet.
M	MATT	Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must be ghosts.
F	LINDA	Those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents.
M	MATT	I'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals.
F	LINDA	Get out of there!
M	FRANK	If the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good.
F	LINDA	I'm going!
M	FRANK	Linda...it's not safe.
F	LINDA	That's why I'm going. Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to the lab. We'll meet you there.
M	FRANK	But...
F	LINDA	Do it.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	Not even close.
F	SEBASTIAN	So... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend.
M	MATT	Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You aren't thinking rationally.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?
M	MATT	Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk this through. It's not too late.
M	MATT (CONT'D)	C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm your friend.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I'm sorry, but I just feel that our friendship is holding me back. I'm sure you understand.
F	SARAH	This way.
M	SARAH (cont'd)	Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.
M	FRANK	He'll be okay.
F	SARAH	It's pretty severe. We have to get him to the lab.
M	FRANK	He's got to be okay.
F	SARAH	For godsakes, help me.
M	MATT	He was going to kill me.
F	LINDA	I know. He's gone.
M	MATT	We've got to got out of here. Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he?
F	LINDA	Habitats.
M	MATT	Oh god. That's right between us and the lab.
F	SARAH	His pulse is faint.
M	SARAH (cont'd)	He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold this.
M	SARAH (cont'd)	Keep applying pressure. Don't move your hand until I got back.
M	FRANK	Where are you going?
F	SARAH	This'll hold him but he needs blood.
M	FRANK	But...
F	SARAH	Supply is right down the hall. I'll be two seconds.
M	FRANK	Sarah, wait for the others
F	SARAH	If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on the wound.
M	MATT	Ahh! Shit! Karl Three. Nice shot.
F	LINDA	He's let the animals out. It wasn't him we were tracking. You okay?
M	MATT	It won't kill me unless it gets infected. You?
F	LINDA	Me .... Don't ask about me. If he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab.
M	MATT	So he could be anywhere right now. What do we do?
F	LINDA	Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and pray to God Frank can reprogram the elevator.
F	SARAH	Frank?
M	SARAH (cont'd)	Who's there? Dr. Caine?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You missed.
F	SARAH	Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me go. What are you doing? No! Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me! FRANK! No... please. Don't do this to me. What do you want?
F	SEBASTIAN	You.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I've always liked your feistiness.
M	FRANK	Sarah! Sarah! Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you let up... Sarah! Sarah!
M	FRANK (cont'd)	Sarah! I'm losing him. Did you see her?
F	LINDA	Where is she?
M	FRANK	She went to the supply room. Carter needed blood.
F	LINDA	I said no one goes anywhere alone.
M	FRANK	She didn't listen. But...
F	LINDA	He's dead.
F	LINDA	Oh god. Sarah! No...
M	FRANK	Her too?
F	LINDA	This didn't happen. This hasn't happened.
M	MATT	It happened alright. Now we have to deal with it.
M	FRANK	Yeah? And just what are we supposed to do now?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Now? Now you die.
F	LINDA	He's here!
M	MATT	Where?
F	LINDA	Sebastian! Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.
M	LINDA (CONT1D)	I don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. This isn't who you are.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I would say that what I am experiencing is psychological awareness. I like you being in complete and absolute control.
F	LINDA	You goddamn bastard! You goddamn bastard. You're gonna pay for this. I'm going to bring you back to visibility and then I'm going throw your ass in jail.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	You're never gonna bring me back Linda. I never want to come back.
F	LINDA	Fuck you!
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time for old times sake.
M	MATT	Don't listen to him. It's not worth it.
M	FRANK	Come on, Matt. Let's go get the elevator back on-line so we can got out of this hell hole.
M	MATT	He does anything, anything at all, come get us. I'll be back to check on you in five.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose. Out of curiosity, what did he give you that I couldn't?
F	LINDA	Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If that's what you want...
F	LINDA	Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...
M	LINDA (cont'd)	Matt! Frank! Matt! Matt! Frank!
F	LINDA	Jesus!
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	Figured it out? You were always so clever.
F	LINDA	No! Hang on!
M	MATT	Get out of here!
F	LINDA	You won't get away with this. They'll find out about you. They'll hunt you down.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	The villagers with their torches? Lock up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's not gonna happen that way.
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)	See, I've spent all my time down here thinking up this plan. When they find you, they'll find a pile of charred corpses. The result of a terrible accident, I'm afraid.
F	LINDA	How can you be so brutal?
M	SEBASTIAN'S VOICE	I guess because I don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore Remember that first night I was out? I did something bad, just to see if I could get away with it. And when I did, I realized I could have it all. I can kill in broad daylight. And nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost. Anything I desire I can make happen, but not if people know.
M	MATT	I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.
F	LINDA	Just keep going. I'll fix you later.
F	LINDA	Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now.
M	MATT	He surprised us. We weren't expecting...
F	LINDA	Shhh. Don't talk. We gotta move. Hang on.
M	MATT	Lin...
M	MATT (cont'd)	I can't feel anything.
F	LINDA	You feel that?
M	MATT	A little...
F	LINDA	Your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals. Sutures and thread.
F	LINDA	Goddamnit.
M	MATT	What're you doing?
F	LINDA	This is temporary. You still with me?
M	MATT	Barely.
F	LINDA	Just keeps getting worse.
F	LINDA	Oh shit.
M	MATT	There's no way out.
F	LINDA	There's got to be.
M	MATT	They say freezing to death isn't so bad. You just kinda pass out.
F	LINDA	Matt! MATT! We're not dying in here. Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies
M	ELEVATOR	Authorization please?
F	SEBASTIAN	Caine. One One One One One.
M	ELEVATOR	Authorization valid. Thank you.
F	LINDA	Sebastian!
M	LINDA (cont'd)	I can't let you leave. Come on out and I'll give you one last chance.
F	SEBASTIAN	You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't hold on to the past.
F	LINDA	Aaaaaaahhhh!
F	SEBASTIAN	Oh God!
F	LINDA	You wanna see God? I'll show you God.
F	SEBASTIAN	I'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them-. Your sister... she never liked me. I think I'll go after her and her little boy first. I just wanted you to know that before you die.
M	MATT	Thought I'd... thought I'd save you for a change.
M	MATT (cont'd)	Let's got out of here.
F	LINDA	Nitro...
M	MATT	He said it himself... All they'll find is a pile of charred corpses.
F	LINDA	He's rigged the centrifuge.
M	MATT	In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab.
F	LINDA	Grab on.
M	MATT	Forget about me. You go.
F	LINDA	Fuck you. Give me your hands.
F	LINDA	Climb!
M	MATT	But...
F	LINDA	Climb!
M	MATT	I can't. I'm going to pass out.
F	LINDA	Keep moving.
F	LINDA	Oh God!
M	MATT	Don't look.
F	LINDA	Move!
M	MATT	It's coming down!
F	LINDA	C'mon. Before it slips. It's him.
M	MATT	Sebastian, you fuck.
F	LINDA	Get off me.
M	MATT	No!
F	LINDA	Let go of me.
F	SEBASTIAN	Remember the day we met? You were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty. Now... Now look at you.
M	MATT	Get off of her!
M	MATT (cont'd)	Sebastian, stop it.
F	SEBASTIAN	You fucked it all up.
F	LINDA	Go to hell.
M	MARINE GUARD	What happened?
F	LINDA	We lived.
M	FADE
