M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	FIGURE	Hello... What?... No, I don't work today... I'm playing hockey at two.
M	FIGURE (O.S.)	Why don't you call Randal?... Because I'm fucking tired... I just closed last night... Jesus... What time are you going to come in?... Twelve... Be there be twelve?... Swear...
M	FIGURE (O.S.)	Swear you'll be in by twelve and I'll do it... Twelve... Twelve or I walk.
M	DANTE	Next time, I get the bed.
M	DANTE	Shit.
M	DANTE	Shit.
M	DANTE	Shit!
M	DANTE	Thanks. Have a good one.
M	ACTIVIST	Do you mind if I drink this here?
M	DANTE	Sure. Go ahead.
F	CUSTOMER	Are you open?
M	DANTE	Yeah.
F	CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.
M	ACTIVIST	Are you sure?
F	CUSTOMER	Am I sure?
M	ACTIVIST	Are you sure?
F	CUSTOMER	Am I sure about what?
M	ACTIVIST	Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
F	CUSTOMER	Are you serious?
M	ACTIVIST	How long have you been smoking?
F	CUSTOMER	What is this, a poll?
M	DANTE	Beats me.
M	ACTIVIST	How long have you been a smoker?
F	CUSTOMER	Since I was thirteen.
M	ACTIVIST	I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
F	CUSTOMER	What the hell is that?
M	ACTIVIST	That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
F	CUSTOMER	You're shittin' me.
M	ACTIVIST	You think I'm shitting you...
F	CUSTOMER	What's this?
M	ACTIVIST	It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
F	CUSTOMER	Unnhh!
M	ACTIVIST	He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
M	DANTE	Excuse me, but...
M	ACTIVIST	This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
F	CUSTOMER	Well, if it's already too late...
M	ACTIVIST	It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
F	CUSTOMER	It's not the same.
M	ACTIVIST	It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
F	CUSTOMER	Jesus!
M	ACTIVIST	It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
F	CUSTOMER	I'll just take the gum.
M	DANTE	Fifty-five.
M	ACTIVIST	You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
M	DANTE	Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
M	ACTIVIST	No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
M	DANTE	If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
M	ACTIVIST	Okay. I'm sorry about that.
F	CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes. What's that?
M	ACTIVIST	This? How long have you been smoking?
F	JAY	WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!
F	JAY	I feel good today, Silent Bob. We're gonna make some money! And then you know what we're going to do? We're going to go to that party and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck this bitch, that bitch... I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!
F	JAY	What you looking at?! I'll kick your fucking ass! Doesn't that motherfucker still owe me ten bucks?
F	JAY	Tonight, you and me are going off that fucker's head, and take out his fucking soul! Remind me if he tries to buy something from us, to cut it with leafs and twigs... or fucking shit in the motherfucker's bag!
F	JAY	Wa sup sluts? Damn Silent Bob! You one rude motherfucker! But you're cute as hell. I wanna go down on you, and suckle you. And then, I wanna line up three more guys, and make like a circus seal...
F	JAY	Ewwww! You fucking faggot! I fucking hate guys! I LOVE WOMEN! Neh.
M	GUY	You selling?
F	JAY	I got hits, hash, weed, and later on I'll have 'shrooms. We take cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa.
M	ACTIVIST	You're spending what? Twenty, thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.
M	LISTENER 1	Forty.
M	LISTENER 2	Fifty-three.
M	ACTIVIST	Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you? Because that's what you're doing now, by paying for the so-called privilege to smoke!
M	LISTENER 3	We all gotta go sometime...
M	ACTIVIST	It's that kind of mentality that allows this cancer-producing industry to thrive. Of course we're all going to die someday, but do we have to pay for it? Do we have to actually throw hard-earned dollars on a counter and say, "Please, please, Mister Merchant of Death, sir; please sell me something that will give me bad breath, stink up my clothes, and fry my lungs."
M	LISTENER 1	It's not that easy to quit.
M	ACTIVIST	Of course it's not; not when you have people like this mindless cretin so happy and willing to sell you nails for your coffin!
M	DANTE	Hey, now wait a sec...
M	ACTIVIST	Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders. Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
M	DANTE	I think you'd better leave now.
M	ACTIVIST	You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
M	DANTE	You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
M	ACTIVIST	You're the disturbance, pal! And here... I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
M	LISTENER 2	Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!
M	ACTIVIST	Oh, he's scared now! He sees the threat we present! He smells the changes coming, and the loss of sales when the nonsmokers finally demand satisfaction. We demand the right to breathe cleaner air!
M	LISTENER 3	Yeah!
M	ACTIVIST	We'd rather chew our gum than embrace slow death! Let's abolish this heinous practice of sucking poison, and if it means ruffling the feathers of a convenience store idiot, then so be it!
M	DANTE	That's it, everybody out.
M	ACTIVIST	We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
M	DANTE	Yeah, but not in here.
M	ACTIVIST	What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
M	DANTE	Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
M	ACTIVIST	The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
M	CROWD	Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
F	VERONICA	Who's leading this mob?
M	SOMEONE	That guy.
M	VERONICA (O.S.)	Freeze.
F	VERONICA	Let's see some credentials.
F	VERONICA	Slowly...
F	VERONICA	You're a Chewlie's Gum representative?
F	VERONICA	And you're stirring up all this antismoking sentiment to... what?... sell more gum?
F	VERONICA	Get out of here.
F	VERONICA	And you people: Don't you have jobs to go to? Get out of here and go commute.
F	VERONICA	You oughta be ashamed of yourselves. Easily led automatons. Try thinking for yourself before you pelt and innocent man with cigarettes.
F	VERONICA	It looked like Tiananmen Square in here for a second.
F	VERONICA	"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me from an extremely ugly mob scene."
F	VERONICA	Okay, champ. What's wrong?
F	VERONICA	All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
M	DANTE	Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
F	VERONICA	At least they weren't lit.
M	DANTE	I hate this fucking place.
F	VERONICA	Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
M	DANTE	Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
F	VERONICA	All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
M	DANTE	I'm not even supposed to be here today!
F	VERONICA	I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
M	DANTE	The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
F	VERONICA	Don't you have a hockey game at two?
M	DANTE	Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
F	VERONICA	Why did you agree to come in then?
M	DANTE	I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
F	VERONICA	Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
M	DANTE	Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
F	VERONICA	You're kidding.
M	DANTE	Bunch of savages in this town.
F	VERONICA	You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
M	DANTE	I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
F	VERONICA	What were you doing up so late?
M	DANTE	Hunhh? Nothing.
F	VERONICA	What were you doing?
M	DANTE	Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
F	VERONICA	Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
M	DANTE	Who's defensive? Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
M	DANTE	What? What is that?
F	VERONICA	She called you, didn't she?
M	DANTE	Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
M	DANTE	What? What's with that look?! I wasn't talking to anyone, especially her! Look at you, being all sort of... I don't know... stand-offish.
M	DANTE	Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug me. I see how it is. All right Pissy- pants, you just go on being suspicious and quiet. I don't even want to hug you at this point.
M	DANTE	Give you a dollar?
M	DANTE	Thanks.
F	VERONICA	How much money did you leave up there?
M	DANTE	Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
F	VERONICA	You're trusting.
M	DANTE	Why do you say that?
F	VERONICA	How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
M	DANTE	Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
F	VERONICA	Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
M	DANTE	I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
F	VERONICA	Do you think anyone can see us down here?
M	DANTE	Why? You wanna have sex or something?
F	VERONICA	Ooh! Can we?!
M	DANTE	Really?
F	VERONICA	I was kidding.
M	DANTE	Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
F	VERONICA	Typically male point of view.
M	DANTE	How do you figure?
F	VERONICA	You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
M	DANTE	Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
F	VERONICA	"Be there?"
M	DANTE	Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
F	VERONICA	How flattering.
M	DANTE	Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
F	VERONICA	Oh, you think so?
M	DANTE	A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
F	VERONICA	And I actually date you?
M	DANTE	Something wrong?
F	VERONICA	I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
M	DANTE	I touched a nerve.
F	VERONICA	I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
M	DANTE	It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
F	VERONICA	You were making a generalization about "broads!"
M	DANTE	These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
F	VERONICA	How many?
M	DANTE	How many what?
F	VERONICA	How many girls have you slept with?
M	DANTE	How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
F	VERONICA	We might have; I don't remember. How many?
M	DANTE	Including you?
F	VERONICA	It better be up to and including me.
M	DANTE	Twelve.
F	VERONICA	You've slept with twelve different girls?
M	DANTE	Including you; yes.
M	DANTE	What the hell was that for?
F	VERONICA	You're a pig.
M	DANTE	Why'd you hit me?
F	VERONICA	Do you know how many different men I've had sex with? Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
F	VERONICA	Three.
M	DANTE	Three?
F	VERONICA	Three including you.
M	DANTE	You've only had sex with three different people?
F	VERONICA	I'm not the pig you are.
M	DANTE	Who?
F	VERONICA	You!
M	DANTE	No; who were the three, besides me?
F	VERONICA	John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
M	DANTE	Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
F	VERONICA	I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
M	DANTE	Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
F	VERONICA	Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
M	DANTE	They put up the least amount of struggle.
F	VERONICA	After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
M	DANTE	All right. Name it.
F	VERONICA	I want you to come with me on Monday.
M	DANTE	Where?
F	VERONICA	To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
M	DANTE	Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
F	VERONICA	It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
M	DANTE	Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
M	DANTE	Shit! Why are we getting up?
F	VERONICA	Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
F	VERONICA	Willam!
M	WILLAM	Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
F	VERONICA	No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
M	DANTE	How are you? Just the soda?
M	WILLAM	And a pack of cigarettes. Are you still going to Seton Hall?
F	VERONICA	No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
M	WILLAM	Do you still talk to Sylvan?
F	VERONICA	I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
M	WILLAM	That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
F	VERONICA	I will. Take it easy.
M	WILLAM	Bye.
F	VERONICA	Bye That was Snowball.
M	DANTE	Why do you call him that?
F	VERONICA	Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
M	DANTE	What do you mean?
F	VERONICA	After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
M	DANTE	He requested this?
F	VERONICA	He gets off on it.
M	DANTE	Sylvan can be talked into anything.
F	VERONICA	Why do you say that?
M	DANTE	Like you said-she snowballed him.
F	VERONICA	Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
M	DANTE	Yeah, right.
F	VERONICA	I'm serious...
M	DANTE	You sucked that guy's dick?
F	VERONICA	Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
M	DANTE	But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
F	VERONICA	That's because I never had sex with him!
M	DANTE	You sucked his dick!
F	VERONICA	We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
M	DANTE	Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
F	VERONICA	Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
M	DANTE	Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
F	VERONICA	I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
M	DANTE	I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
F	VERONICA	Please calm down.
M	DANTE	How many?
F	VERONICA	Dante...
M	DANTE	How many dicks have you sucked?!
F	VERONICA	Let it go...
M	DANTE	HOW MANY?
F	VERONICA	All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
M	DANTE	This is different. This is important. How many?!
M	DANTE	Well...?
F	VERONICA	Something like thirty-six.
M	DANTE	WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
F	VERONICA	Lower your voice!
M	DANTE	What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
F	VERONICA	Um. Thirty-seven.
M	DANTE	I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
F	VERONICA	I'm going to class.
M	DANTE	Thirty-seven?! My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
F	CUSTOMER	In a row?
M	DANTE	Hey! Where are you going?!
F	VERONICA	Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
M	DANTE	No, but you sucked enough dick!
F	VERONICA	Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
M	DANTE	A few?
F	VERONICA	...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
M	DANTE	Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
F	VERONICA	Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
M	DANTE	I feel sick.
F	VERONICA	I love you. Don't feel sick.
M	DANTE	Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
F	VERONICA	I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
M	DANTE	Thirty-seven. I just can't...
F	VERONICA	Goodbye, Dante.
M	DANTE	Try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot!
M	DANTE	HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE!
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	I thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven o'clock?
M	DANTE	I called his house twice already.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
M	DANTE	I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	You calling me a liar?
M	DANTE	No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
M	DANTE	Actually, that's his night job.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work. I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch. You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
M	DANTE	If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
M	DANTE	You forgot your keys.
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	The guy ain't here yet.
M	RANDAL	You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	I know. I've been here since eleven.
M	RANDAL	Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
M	RANDAL	Which one?
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	Dental School.
M	RANDAL	You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	I have first dibs.
M	RANDAL	Says who?
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
M	RANDAL	Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	Like hell you are!
M	RANDAL	I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	Twenty bucks?
M	RANDAL	Twenty bucks.
M	V.A. CUSTOMER	All right, asshole, you're on.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	You see a pair of keys lying around here somewhere?
M	DANTE	You're late.
M	RANDAL	What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
M	DANTE	The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
M	RANDAL	Why are the shutters closed?
M	DANTE	Someone jammed gum in the locks.
M	RANDAL	Bunch of savages in this town.
M	DANTE	That's what I said.
M	RANDAL	Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
M	RANDAL	What time do you have to stay till?
M	DANTE	He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
M	RANDAL	What smells like shoe polish?
M	DANTE	Go open the sore.
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Hey-did you see a set of keys lying around here?
M	RANDAL	No time for love, Doctor Jones!
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Fucking kids.
M	RANDAL	Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday. I tore up his membership.
M	DANTE	Shocking abuse of authority.
M	RANDAL	I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying?
M	DANTE	Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
M	RANDAL	I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
M	RANDAL	Want something to drink? I'm buying.
M	DANTE (O.S.)	No, thanks.
M	RANDAL	Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
M	DANTE (O.S.)	Why?
M	RANDAL	I wanted to use your car.
M	RANDAL	Snake cake?
M	DANTE	You don't want to know.
M	RANDAL	You called Caitlin again?
M	DANTE	She called me.
M	RANDAL	Did you tell Veronica?
M	DANTE	One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
M	RANDAL	What do you two fight about?
M	DANTE	I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
M	RANDAL	I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
M	DANTE	You win.
M	RANDAL	I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
M	DANTE	Seven months.
M	RANDAL	Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
M	DANTE	Five years.
M	RANDAL	Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
M	DANTE	Eight and a half.
M	RANDAL	Eight and a half?
M	DANTE	Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
M	RANDAL	That's cheating?
M	DANTE	In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
M	RANDAL	She called you Brad?
M	DANTE	She called me Brad.
M	RANDAL	That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
M	DANTE	I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
M	RANDAL	What do you mean?
M	DANTE	She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
M	RANDAL	Oh, my God.
M	DANTE	Great story, isn't it?
M	RANDAL	That girl was vile to you.
M	DANTE	Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
M	RANDAL	Your mother.
M	DANTE	Allan Harris.
M	RANDAL	Chess team Allan Harris?!
M	DANTE	The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
M	RANDAL	That's frightening.
M	DANTE	It takes different strokes to move the world.
M	RANDAL	In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
M	DANTE	Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. Oh yeah.
M	DANTE	I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
M	RANDAL	You think things would be any different now?
M	DANTE	They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
M	RANDAL	Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
M	DANTE	I'm talking to myself here.
M	RANDAL	No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
M	DANTE	...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
M	RANDAL	What about Veronica?
M	DANTE	I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
M	RANDAL	Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
M	DANTE	I think it's safe to say yes.
M	RANDAL	Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
M	DANTE	All four?
M	RANDAL	You, Veronica, Caitlin... ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
M	RANDAL	Yes, I'd like to place an order, please... Thank you.
M	MOTHER	Excuse me, but do you sell videotapes?
M	RANDAL	What were you looking for?
M	MOTHER	It's called Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup.
M	SMALL CHILD	Happy Scrappy!
M	RANDAL	I'm on the phone with the distribution house now. Let me make sure they have it. What's it called again?
M	MOTHER	Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup.
M	SMALL CHILD	Happy Scrappy!

M	RANDAL	And a copy of Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup... Okay, thanks. Sixteen forty-nine. It'll be here Monday.
M	SMALL CHILD	Cunt!
M	DANTE	Yes, I'd like to check on a misprint in today's edition... Today's edition... It says "Bree to Wed Asian Design Major... No, no; everything's spelled fine. I just wanted to know if the piece was a misprint... I don't know, like a typographical error or something... Maybe it's supposed to be Caitlin Bray, or Caitlin Bre, with one e... I'm a curious party... A curious party...
M	DANTE	...I'm an ex-boyfriend... Well, it's just that we talk all the time, and she never mentioned this engagement, which is why I'm thinking maybe it's a misprint... ...Are you sure?... Maybe there's like a vindictive printer working for you...
M	DANTE	Meaning like someone who maybe-I don't know-asked her out once and got shot down, and his revenge is throwing this bogus article in when the paper went to press... Hello?... Hello?
F	JAY	"Not in me." That's what she says. I gotta pull out and spank it to get it on. So I blow a nut on her belly, and I get out of there, just as my uncle walks in. It was such a close call. I tell you what, though, I don't care if she is my cousin, I'm gonna knock those boots again tonight.
F	JAY	Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
M	GIRL 1	Scumbag. What are you doing?
F	JAY	Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin. He's your cousin?
F	JAY	Check this out, he's from Russia.
M	GIRL 1	No way.
F	JAY	I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
F	JAY	See? And Silent Bob never told a lie in his life.
M	GIRL 2	What part of Russia?
F	JAY	I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer? Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
M	SILENT BOB	Home.
M	OLAF	Moscow.
M	GIRL 1	He only speaks Russian?
F	JAY	He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
M	GIRL 2	Is he staying here?
F	JAY	He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
M	GIRL 1	No way!
F	JAY	Swear. Olaf, metal!
F	JAY	That's his fucking metal face. Olaf, girls nice?
M	OLAF	Skrelnick.
F	JAY	That's fucked up.
M	GIRL 1	What did he say?
F	JAY	I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
M	GIRL 2	He really wants to play metal?
F	JAY	He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
M	GIRL 1	That doesn't sound metal.
F	JAY	You gotta hear him sing. Olaf, "Berserker!"
F	JAY	Come on, man, "Berserker!"
M	GIRL 2	Does he sing in English or Russian?
F	JAY	English. Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
M	OLAF	Da. Da.
F	JAY	He's gonna sing it. This is too funny.
M	OLAF	MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK BERSERKER! WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MAKING FUCK? BERSERKER!
F	JAY	That's fucking funny, man!
M	GIRL 1	Did he say "making fuck?"
F	JAY	Wait, there's more. Olaf: sing...
M	OLAF	MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A ROCK BERSERKER!WOULD YOU LIKE TO SMOKE SOME POT? BERSERKER!
M	OLAF	MY LOVE FOR YOU IS TICKING CLOCK BERSERKER!WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY COCK? BERSERKER!
M	DANTE	You hold the counter and I'll pull.
M	MAN	Usually I just turn the can upside down.
M	DANTE	Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
M	MAN	They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
M	DANTE	I think it's coming now...
M	MAN	Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
M	DANTE	I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
M	MAN	It stings a little.
M	DANTE	A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
M	MAN	Thanks.
M	DANTE	Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
M	RANDAL	You know what I just watched?
M	DANTE	Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
M	RANDAL	Return of the Jedi.
M	DANTE	Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
M	RANDAL	Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
M	DANTE	Empire.
M	RANDAL	Blasphemy.
M	DANTE	Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
M	RANDAL	There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
M	DANTE	What's that?
M	RANDAL	All right, Vader's boss...
M	DANTE	The Emperor.
M	RANDAL	Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
M	DANTE	How do you mean?
M	RANDAL	Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
M	DANTE	I guess.
M	RANDAL	Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
M	DANTE	Yeah.
M	RANDAL	Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
M	DANTE	It would stand to reason, yes.
M	RANDAL	Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
M	DANTE	More or less.
M	RANDAL	The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
M	DANTE	I think they were Catholics.
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	Are you open?
M	DANTE	Yeah. Come in.
M	RANDAL	You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
M	DANTE	There's more?
M	RANDAL	So they build another Death Star, right?
M	DANTE	Yeah.
M	RANDAL	Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
M	DANTE	Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
M	RANDAL	And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
M	DANTE	Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
M	RANDAL	Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
M	DANTE	And you figured it out?
M	RANDAL	Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
M	DANTE	Basically.
M	RANDAL	So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
M	DANTE	And the second time around...?
M	RANDAL	The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
M	DANTE	So?
M	RANDAL	A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
M	DANTE	Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
M	RANDAL	Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms.
M	DANTE	All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
M	RANDAL	All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius. You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt, but what were you talking about?
M	RANDAL	The ending of Return of the Jedi.
M	DANTE	My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels.
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm a roofer... Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements. And speaking as a roofer, I can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs.
M	RANDAL	Like when?
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	Three months ago I was offered a job up in the hills. A beautiful house with tons of property. It was a simple reshingling job, but I was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. Then I realized whose house it was.
M	DANTE	Whose house was it?
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	Dominick Bambino's.
M	RANDAL	"Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	The same. The money was right, but the risk was too big. I knew who he was, and based on that, I passed the job on to a friend of mine.
M	DANTE	Based on personal politics.
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	Right. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished shingling.
M	RANDAL	No way!
M	BLUE-COLLAR MAN	I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. You know, any contractor willing to work on that Death Star knew the risks. If they were killed, it was their own fault. A roofer listens to this... not his wallet.
M	WOMAN	Is that video store open or not?
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	They say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Are either of these any good?
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Sir!
M	RANDAL	What.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Are either of these any good?
M	RANDAL	I don't watch movies.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Well, have you heard anything about either of them?
M	RANDAL	No.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
M	RANDAL (O.S.)	I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Well, how about these two movies?
M	RANDAL	They suck.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
M	RANDAL	No, I wasn't.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I don't think your manager would appreciate...
M	RANDAL	I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I beg your pardon!
M	RANDAL	Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
M	RANDAL	I hope it feels good.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	You hope what feels good?
M	RANDAL	I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
M	RANDAL	You'll be missed.
M	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Screw you!
M	RANDAL	You're not allowed to rent here anymore!
M	RANDAL	Screw me!
M	RANDAL	You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
M	DANTE	Wait.
M	RANDAL	She's in here?
M	DANTE	This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
M	DANTE (O.S.)	This has been going on for twenty minutes.
M	RANDAL	What's he looking for?
M	DANTE	He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
M	RANDAL	Perfect dozen.
M	DANTE	Each egg has to be perfect.
M	RANDAL	The quest isn't going well?
M	DANTE	Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
M	RANDAL (O.S.)	Why doesn't he just mix and match?
M	DANTE	I told him that and he yelled at me.
M	RANDAL	What did he say?
M	DANTE	He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
M	RANDAL	It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
M	DANTE	I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
M	SMOKER	Two packs of cigarettes.
M	RANDAL	I'm as puzzled as you.
M	SMOKER	I've actually seen it before.
M	DANTE	You know him?
M	SMOKER	No, I've seen that behavior before. Looking for the perfect carton of eggs, right?
M	RANDAL	Yeah. How'd you know?
M	SMOKER	I'll bet you a million bucks that the guy's a guidance counselor.
M	DANTE	Why do you say that?
M	SMOKER	I was in the Food City last year when the same thing happened, different guy though. Stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit. I ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more.
M	RANDAL	Get out of here.
M	SMOKER	I kid you not. They call it Shell Shock. Only happens with guidance counselors for some reason. The kid said they used to make a big deal about it, but there's no point.
M	SMOKER (O.S.)	He said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody.
M	DANTE	Why guidance counselors?
M	SMOKER	If your job served as little purpose as theirs, wouldn't you lose it, too?
M	RANDAL	Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kind of worthless.
M	SMOKER	See? It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys. That's why I kill Chinamen for the railroad.
M	LITTLE GIRL	Can I have a pack of cigarettes?
M	DANTE	Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
M	RANDAL	You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
M	DANTE	What's a jizz-mopper?
M	RANDAL	He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
M	DANTE	Nudie booth?
M	RANDAL	Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
M	DANTE	I guess not.
M	RANDAL	Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
M	DANTE	What kind of show?
M	RANDAL	Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening. He's led a very sheltered life.
M	DANTE	Can we talk about this later?
M	RANDAL	The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
F	CUSTOMER	This is the last time I come to this place.
M	DANTE	Excuse me?
F	CUSTOMER	Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
M	DANTE	We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
F	CUSTOMER	Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
M	RANDAL	Well, you think that's offensive...
M	RANDAL	...then check this out. I think you can see her kidneys.
M	DANTE	Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please, wait a second, ma'am...
M	DANTE	Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
M	RANDAL	Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
M	DANTE	I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
M	RANDAL	You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
M	DANTE	What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
M	RANDAL	Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
M	DANTE	There aren't.
M	RANDAL	How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
M	DANTE	It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
M	RANDAL	Let's hear it.
M	DANTE	The milkmaids.
M	RANDAL	The milkmaids?
M	DANTE (O.S.)	The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
M	RANDAL	You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
M	DANTE	Which ones?
M	RANDAL	All of them.
M	FIRST	What would you get for a six-year- old boy who chronically wets his bed?
M	SECOND	Do you have any new movies in?
M	THIRD	Do you have that one with the guy who was in that movie that was out last year?
M	RANDAL	And they never rent quality flicks; they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the rack.
M	FIRST	Ooooh! Home Alone!
M	SECOND	Ooooh! Hook!
M	THIRD	Ooooh! Navy Seals!
M	RANDAL	It's like in order to join, they have to have an IQ less than their shoe size.
M	DANTE	You think you get stupid questions? You should hear the barrage of stupid questions I get.
M	FIRST	What do you mean there's no ice? You mean I've gotta drink this coffee hot?!
M	SECOND	How much?
M	THIRD	Do you sell hubcaps?
M	RANDAL	See? You vented. Don't you feel better now?
M	DANTE	No.
M	RANDAL	Why not?
M	DANTE	Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
M	RANDAL	Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
M	DANTE	Veronica!
F	VERONICA	What happened to home by twelve?
M	DANTE	He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
F	VERONICA	Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
M	DANTE	What is it?
F	VERONICA	Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
M	DANTE	Really? You're the best.
F	VERONICA	I'm glad you've calmed down a bit. Hi, Randal. Thirty-seven!
M	DANTE	Shut up! Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
M	DANTE	Why don't you go back to the video store?
F	VERONICA	You had to tell him.
M	DANTE	I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
F	VERONICA	What did he say?
M	DANTE	At least he wasn't thirty-six.
F	VERONICA	And that made you feel better?
M	DANTE	And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
F	VERONICA	The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
M	DANTE	...it isn't there. Yes.
F	VERONICA	Thank you for being rational.
M	DANTE	Thank you for the lasagne.
F	VERONICA	You couldn't get these shutters open?
M	DANTE	I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
F	VERONICA	Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
M	DANTE	What time do you get finished?
F	VERONICA	Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
M	DANTE	Sure.
F	VERONICA	Good. I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
M	RANDAL	All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
F	CUSTOMER	This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
M	RANDAL	Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
M	DANTE	Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
M	RANDAL	Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
M	DANTE	The best Burtless movie ever made.
F	CUSTOMER	Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
M	RANDAL	Lenin's Tomb.
M	DANTE	Hello, is Mr. Synder there? This is Dante... Did he say if he was on his way here?... Here... The convenience store... I know, but the other guy called out this morning and Mr. Synder asked me to cover until he got here. He said he'd be here by noon, but it's one-thirty now, so I... Excuse me... Vermont?!... No, that can't be; I talked to him this morning... He left at what time?... He really went to Vermont?... When the hell was someone going to tell me?... He promised he was coming by noon!... Jesus... When does he get back?!... TUESDAY!... You've gotta be fucking kidding me!... I've got a hockey game at two, and the fucking shutters are jammed closed, and he's in Vermont?... I'm not even supposed to be here today!! So I'm stuck here till closing?... This is just great... I just can't believe... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you... No... No, I'll be all right... Well, that's all I can do, right?... Thanks.
M	RANDAL	Vermont?
M	DANTE	Can you believe this?!
M	RANDAL	He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
M	DANTE	Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
M	RANDAL	So, what-you're stuck here all day?
M	DANTE	FUCK!
M	RANDAL	Why'd you apologize?
M	DANTE	What?
M	RANDAL	I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
M	DANTE	I know.
M	RANDAL	That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
M	DANTE	I don't back down.
M	RANDAL	Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
M	DANTE	You know what pisses me off the most?
M	RANDAL	The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
M	DANTE	I'm going to miss the game.
M	RANDAL	Because you buckled.
M	DANTE	Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
M	RANDAL	Don't yell at me, pal.
M	DANTE	Sorry.
M	RANDAL	See? There you go again.
M	DANTE	I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
M	RANDAL	At least we're stuck here together.
M	DANTE	You've got a customer. What? What do you want?!
M	DANTE	Sanford? Dante... I can't play today... I'm stuck at work... I know I'm not scheduled, but-just forget it. I can't play... Neither can Randal... He's working too...
M	DANTE	Wait a second. Do we have to play at the park?... Hold on... Do you feel limber?
M	DANTE	Pull my laces tighter.
M	RANDAL	I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
M	DANTE	I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
M	RANDAL	No argument here. Insubordination rules.
M	DANTE	I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
M	SANFORD	Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
M	DANTE	If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
M	SANFORD	So?
M	DANTE	So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
M	SANFORD	What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
M	DANTE	I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
M	SANFORD	What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
M	RANDAL	He's blunt, but he's got a point.
M	DANTE	At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
M	SANFORD	All I'm saying is if you're going to be insubordinate, you should go the full nine and not pussy out when it comes to free refreshments.
M	RANDAL	He's right. As if we're suddenly gonna have a run on Gatorade.
M	SANFORD	Fuckin-A.
M	DANTE	All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
M	SANFORD	Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
M	RANDAL	Design major.
M	DANTE	Can we not talk about this?
M	SANFORD	Fine by me. But you're living in denial and suppressing rage. Dante said we can all drink free Gatorade.
M	RANDAL	Are you gonna lock the store?
M	DANTE	I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
M	RANDAL	Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
M	DANTE	We're not playing in the street.
M	RANDAL	Then where're we gonna play?
M	DANTE	Ready?
F	CUSTOMER	When's this period over?
M	SOMEONE (O.S.)	Eight more minutes!
F	CUSTOMER	Are you shitting me? I want to get cigarettes!
M	DANTE	If you can just wait a few more minutes.
F	CUSTOMER	Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
M	SOMEONE (O.S.)	Dante! Where are you?!
F	CUSTOMER	He's busy!
M	DANTE	I'll be right back. It's almost over.
F	CUSTOMER	What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
M	DANTE (O.S.)	In a second!
F	CUSTOMER	Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass! I can pass!
F	CUSTOMER	How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
M	DANTE	Who are you to make assessments?
F	CUSTOMER	I'll assess all I want! DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT!
F	CUSTOMER	Don't pass to this guy! He sucks! You suck!
M	DANTE	Like you're better!
F	CUSTOMER	I can whip your ass.
M	DANTE (O.S.)	That's easy to say from over here.
M	CUSTOMER (O.S.)	Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
M	WOMAN	Is the convenience store open?
M	DANTE AND CUSTOMER	NO!
M	DANTE	There's a stick over there. You're shooting against the goal. REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK ON!
M	DANTE	Give me another ball.
M	SOMEONE (O.S.)	There are no more.
M	DANTE	What the fuck are you talking about? How many balls did you bring?
M	SANFORD	There was the orange ball... and the orange ball.
M	DANTE	Are there any balls down there?! 'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
M	DANTE	You only brought one ball?!
M	SANFORD	I thought Redding had like three balls!
M	REDDING (O.S.)	I thought Dante had the balls.
M	DANTE	Nobody has another ball?
M	SANFORD	Shit!
M	DANTE	We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!! I'm not even supposed to be here today!
M	SANFORD	We still get free Gatorade, right?
M	OLD MAN	Be careful.
M	DANTE	I'm trying.
M	OLD MAN	You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
M	DANTE	So I'm told.
M	OLD MAN	I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
M	DANTE	And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
M	OLD MAN	No, he got hit by a bus.
M	DANTE	Oh... Can I help you?
M	OLD MAN	Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
M	DANTE	Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
M	OLD MAN	I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
M	DANTE	Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
M	OLD MAN	Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
M	DANTE	The white kind.
M	OLD MAN	I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
M	DANTE	Actually, it is kind of rough.
M	OLD MAN	Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
M	DANTE	Yeah, but...
M	OLD MAN	Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
M	DANTE	Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
M	OLD MAN	Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
M	OLD MAN	Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read? It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
M	DANTE	Jesus... go ahead.
M	OLD MAN	Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
M	DANTE	You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
M	OLD MAN	Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
M	DANTE	I said go ahead.
M	OLD MAN	No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
M	DANTE	The porno mags?
M	OLD MAN	Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
M	DANTE	Here. Now leave me alone.
M	OLD MAN	Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
M	OLD MAN	Thanks son. I appreciate this.
M	RANDAL	Helluva game!
M	DANTE	One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
M	RANDAL	Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
M	DANTE	Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
M	RANDAL	Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
M	DANTE	Gatorade. What happened to all the Gatorade?
M	DANTE	Exactly. They drank it all.
M	RANDAL (O.S.)	After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
M	DANTE	"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
M	RANDAL	You know what Sanford told me?
M	DANTE	I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
M	RANDAL	Julie Dwyer died.
M	DANTE	Yeah, right.
M	RANDAL	No, I'm serious.
M	DANTE	Oh, my god.
M	RANDAL	Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
M	DANTE	How? When?
M	RANDAL	Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
M	DANTE	Jesus.
M	RANDAL	She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
M	DANTE	I haven't seen her in almost two years.
M	RANDAL	Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
M	DANTE	Number six.
M	RANDAL	You've had sex with a dead person.
M	DANTE	I'm gonna go to her wake.
M	RANDAL	No, you're not.
M	DANTE	Why not?
M	RANDAL	It's today.
M	DANTE	What!?
M	RANDAL	Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
M	DANTE	Shit. What about tomorrow?
M	RANDAL	One night only. She's buried in the morning.
M	DANTE	You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
M	RANDAL	Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
M	DANTE	You hardly knew her!
M	RANDAL	True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
M	DANTE	Stop it. This is beneath even you.
M	RANDAL	I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
M	DANTE	You hate people.
M	RANDAL	But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
M	DANTE	Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
M	RANDAL	If you go, I go.
M	DANTE	She meant nothing to you!
M	RANDAL	She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
M	DANTE	I'm not taking you to this funeral.
M	RANDAL	I'm going with you.
M	DANTE	I can't close the store.
M	RANDAL	You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
M	DANTE	Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
M	RANDAL	You were saying?
M	DANTE	Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
M	RANDAL	She was pretty young, hunhh?
M	DANTE	Twenty-two; same as us.
M	RANDAL	An embolism in a pool.
M	DANTE	An embarrassing way to die.
M	RANDAL	That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
M	DANTE	How'd he die?
M	RANDAL	Broke his neck.
M	DANTE	That's embarrassing?
M	RANDAL	He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
M	DANTE	Shut the hell up.
M	RANDAL	Bible truth.
M	DANTE	Stop it.
M	RANDAL	I swear.
M	DANTE	Oh, my god.
M	RANDAL	Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
M	DANTE	No!
M	RANDAL	Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
M	DANTE	Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
M	RANDAL	No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
M	DANTE	Who found him?
M	RANDAL	My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
M	DANTE	His dick was in his mouth?
M	RANDAL	Balls resting on his lips.
M	DANTE	He made it, hunhh?
M	RANDAL	Yeah, but at what a price.
M	DANTE	I could never reach.
M	RANDAL	Reach what?
M	DANTE	You know.
M	RANDAL	What, your dick?
M	DANTE	Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
M	RANDAL	I never tried it.
M	RANDAL	Fucking pervert.
M	DANTE	I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
M	RANDAL	Listen to you.
M	DANTE	I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
M	RANDAL	Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
M	DANTE	I can't fucking believe you!!
M	RANDAL	I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
M	DANTE	You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
M	RANDAL	I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
M	DANTE	Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
M	RANDAL	So the casket fell over! Big deal!
M	DANTE	Her fucking body fell out!
M	RANDAL	So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
M	DANTE	Just... go! Go open the video store.
M	JAY (O.S.)	Yeah! Open the video store!!
M	RANDAL	Shut the fuck up, junkie!
M	DANTE	Go open the video store.
F	JAY	Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
M	DANTE	How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
F	JAY	I'm not dealing.
M	KID	You got anything, man?
F	JAY	Yeah, what do you want?
M	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Hey, did you see a set of keys lying around here somewhere?
M	RANDAL	Let me borrow your car.
M	DANTE	I don't want to talk to you.
M	RANDAL	Fine. Just lend me your car.
M	DANTE	Why should I loan you my car?
M	RANDAL	I want to rent a movie.
M	DANTE	You want to rent a movie.
M	RANDAL	What's that for?
M	DANTE	You work in a video store!
M	RANDAL	I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
F	CUSTOMER	Are you open?
M	DANTE AND RANDAL	YES!
F	CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name?
M	RANDAL	Annoying Customer.
M	DANTE	Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
M	RANDAL	Let me borrow your car.
M	DANTE	May I be blunt with you?
M	RANDAL	If you must.
M	DANTE	We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
M	RANDAL	I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
M	DANTE	There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
F	CUSTOMER	Are you open?
M	DANTE	Yes.
M	RANDAL	You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
M	DANTE	considering that it's my car that's up for request. Can I help you?
F	CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.
M	RANDAL	What's your point?
M	DANTE	My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
F	CUSTOMER	"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase." They print any kind of shit in these papers.
M	DANTE	They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
M	RANDAL	So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
M	DANTE	What?
M	RANDAL	The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
M	DANTE	Exactly.
F	CUSTOMER	I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
M	RANDAL	So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
M	DANTE	That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
M	RANDAL	Not yet.
F	CUSTOMER	And I remember this one time the damn paper said...
F	CUSTOMER	I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
M	DANTE	Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
F	CUSTOMER	Well, he missed!
M	DANTE	I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
F	CUSTOMER	This is the last time I ever come here. And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
M	DANTE	What the fuck did you do that for?
M	RANDAL	Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
M	DANTE	Jesus!
M	RANDAL	And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
M	DANTE	What?
M	RANDAL	If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. Agreed?
M	DANTE	You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
M	RANDAL	I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
M	DANTE	Please, get the hell out of here.
M	RANDAL	I know I'm your hero.
M	TRAINER	Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
M	DANTE	Excuse me?
M	TRAINER	I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
M	DANTE	I didn't strain. I sighed.
M	TRAINER	I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
M	DANTE	I don't think so.
M	TRAINER	Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
M	DANTE	They are not.
M	TRAINER	Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
M	DANTE	What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
M	TRAINER	No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
F	HEATHER	Are you open?
M	DANTE	Yes.
F	HEATHER	Just the paper.
M	DANTE	Thirty-fire.
M	TRAINER	Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
F	HEATHER	I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
M	TRAINER	He is.
M	DANTE	I am not.
M	TRAINER	How much can you bench?
M	DANTE	I don't know.
F	HEATHER	I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
M	DANTE	I know I can bench more than that!
M	TRAINER	I think the lady called it.
F	HEATHER	My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
M	TRAINER	I do about three-fifty, four.
F	HEATHER	No way!
M	TRAINER	Feel that.
F	HEATHER	That's tight. Solid.
M	TRAINER	Now feel his. Roll up your sleeve, chief.
M	DANTE	Oh for God's sake!
M	TRAINER	See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card. I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
M	SUITED MAN	You open?
M	DANTE	Yes. I'm not out of shape.
M	SUITED MAN	Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
M	DANTE	What?
F	HEATHER	He's got those love handles.
M	DANTE	I don't have love handles.
M	SUITED MAN	Were you working here at about four o'clock?
M	DANTE	I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
M	TRAINER	It's probably from being around all this food every day.
F	HEATHER	Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
M	DANTE	I'm not out of shape!
M	SUITED MAN	Can I have your name please?
M	DANTE	Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
F	HEATHER	You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
M	TRAINER	Because he's out of shape.
M	DANTE	Do I know you?
F	HEATHER	You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
M	DANTE	Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
F	HEATHER	I'm her sister.
M	DANTE	You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
F	HEATHER	Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
M	TRAINER	Did you say Caitlin Bree?
M	DANTE	Yeah.
M	TRAINER	Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
M	DANTE	Yeah?
M	TRAINER	And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
M	DANTE	How do you know that?
M	TRAINER	Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
M	DANTE	No, she's getting married.
M	TRAINER	To you?
F	HEATHER	To an Asian design major.
M	TRAINER	Shit! Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
M	DANTE	What?
M	TRAINER	While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
F	HEATHER	Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
M	TRAINER	Yeah!
M	DANTE	You know him?
F	HEATHER	Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
M	TRAINER	Really?
F	HEATHER	Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
M	DANTE	Wait a second! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
M	TRAINER	All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
M	DANTE	I... I don't believe this...
F	HEATHER	I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
M	DANTE	THE GLADES MOTEL?
M	TRAINER	Holy shit! She told you about that! Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
F	HEATHER	She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
M	DANTE	What? When? When did all this shit happen?
M	TRAINER	Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
F	HEATHER	I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
M	DANTE	Jesus Christ, what next?
M	SUITED MAN	Here you go.
M	DANTE	What's this?
M	SUITED MAN	A fine, for five hundred dollars.
M	DANTE	WHAT?
M	TRAINER	Five hundred bucks? What for?
M	SUITED MAN	For violation of New Jersey Statute Section Two A, number one-seventy slash fifty-one: Any person who sells or makes available tobacco or tobacco- related products to persons under the age of eighteen is regarded as disorderly.
M	DANTE	What are you talking about?
M	SUITED MAN	According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
M	DANTE	I didn't do that!
M	SUITED MAN	You said you were here all day?
M	DANTE	Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
M	SUITED MAN	An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours. It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
M	DANTE	But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
M	TRAINER	To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
F	HEATHER	That's sick, Dante.
M	DANTE	I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
M	SUITED MAN	The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
M	DANTE	But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
M	TRAINER	Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old. Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
F	HEATHER	Sure. How about the beach?
M	TRAINER	I like the way you think.
M	DANTE	Jesus! What next? Dante?
M	DANTE	What?
M	DANTE	Caitlin?
F	JAY	That's the price, my brother.
M	JOHN	Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
F	JAY	For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
M	JOHN	How long you gonna be here?
F	JAY	Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
M	JOHN	You're gonna be at John K's party?
F	JAY	My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh.
M	JOHN	Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
F	JAY	The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
M	JOHN	Yo. I'll see you at that party. I'll see you there?
F	JAY	I'll see you there.
F	JAY	It's motherfuckers like that who give recreational drug users a bag name. HEY BABY! YOU EVER HAD YOUR ASSHOLE LICKED?
M	DANTE	When did you get back?
F	CAITLIN	Just now.
M	DANTE	My God. I haven't seen you since...
F	CAITLIN	Dante. You've got a customer.
F	CAITLIN	I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
M	DANTE	Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
F	CAITLIN	Train. It took eight hours.
M	DANTE	I can't believe you're here.
F	CUSTOMER	Excuse me, do you have...
M	DANTE	To the back, above the oil. How long are you staying?
F	CAITLIN	Until Monday. Then I have to take the train back.
F	CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes. Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper. She's marrying an Asian design major.
M	DANTE	So I'm told.
F	JAY	Man, it's fucking slow.
F	CAITLIN	You're just going to lock the store like that?
M	DANTE	I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
F	CAITLIN	You saw it?
M	DANTE	Very dramatic, I thought.
F	CAITLIN	It's not what you think.
M	DANTE	What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
F	CAITLIN	I'm not pregnant.
M	DANTE	Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
F	CAITLIN	I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
M	DANTE	You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
F	CAITLIN	I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
M	DANTE	And you said yes?
F	CAITLIN	Well... kind of, sort of?
M	DANTE	Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
F	CAITLIN	I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
M	DANTE	How do you know that?
F	CAITLIN	Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
M	DANTE	So you're really getting married?
F	CAITLIN	No.
M	DANTE	No, you're not really getting married?
F	CAITLIN	The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
M	DANTE	How like her.
F	CAITLIN	Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
M	DANTE	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
F	CAITLIN	Was I right?
M	DANTE	Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
F	CAITLIN	I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on. What smells like shoe polish?
M	DANTE	And you came here to what? To comfort me?
F	CAITLIN	The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
M	DANTE	But you were.
F	CAITLIN	No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
M	DANTE	Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
F	CAITLIN	I'm giving him his ring back.
M	DANTE	What?
F	CAITLIN	I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
M	DANTE	Sang? His name is a past tense?
F	CAITLIN	Stop it. He's a nice guy.
M	DANTE	If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
F	CAITLIN	I just told you.
M	DANTE	There's more, isn't there?
F	CAITLIN	Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
M	DANTE	Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
F	CAITLIN	You don't have anything to do with it.
M	DANTE	You lie.
F	CAITLIN	Look how full of yourself you are.
M	DANTE	I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
F	CAITLIN	If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
M	DANTE	Jesus, you're caustic.
F	CAITLIN	I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
M	DANTE	So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
F	CAITLIN	Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
M	DANTE	But can we date?
F	CAITLIN	I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
M	DANTE	We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
F	CAITLIN	You're serious. You want to date again.
M	DANTE	I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
F	CAITLIN	It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
M	DANTE	Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
F	CAITLIN	You work in a market, all right.
M	DANTE	Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
F	CAITLIN	The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
M	DANTE	So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
F	CAITLIN	I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
M	DANTE	Let me take you out tonight.
F	CAITLIN	You mean, on a date?
M	DANTE	Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
F	CAITLIN	The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
M	DANTE	You have a better suggestion?
F	CAITLIN	How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
M	DANTE	I hear that's a rather popular date.
F	CAITLIN	Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
M	DANTE	What about Sing?
F	CAITLIN	Sang.
M	DANTE	Sang.
F	CAITLIN	He's not invited.
M	DANTE	He's your fiancé.
F	CAITLIN	I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again. And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
M	DANTE	So what are you saying?
F	CAITLIN	You're such an asshole.
M	DANTE	I'm just kidding.
F	CAITLIN	I can already tell this isn't going to work.
M	DANTE	I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
F	CAITLIN	Where'd he go? I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
M	DANTE	He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
F	CAITLIN	You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
M	DANTE	Who doesn't?
F	CAITLIN	Well, me I guess. So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
M	DANTE	What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
F	CAITLIN	I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome.
M	DANTE	YES!
M	RANDAL	Get to work.
M	DANTE	What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
M	RANDAL	Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
M	DANTE	And this is what you rented?
M	RANDAL	I like to expand my horizons.
M	DANTE	I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
M	RANDAL	No way!
M	DANTE	Five hundred dollars.
M	RANDAL	You're bullshitting.
M	RANDAL	I didn't think they even enforced this.
M	DANTE	Living proof.
M	RANDAL	I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
M	DANTE	I don't; you did.
M	RANDAL	Really?
M	DANTE	Little girl. Maybe five years old?
M	RANDAL	Holy shit. That girl?
M	DANTE	As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
M	RANDAL	Then how come you got the fine?
M	DANTE	Because I'm here.
M	RANDAL	You're lying.
M	DANTE	I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
M	RANDAL	Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
M	DANTE	Because I'm happy.
M	RANDAL	You're happy?
M	DANTE	I'm happy.
M	RANDAL	You're happy to get a fine?
M	DANTE	No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
M	RANDAL	Now I know you're lying.
M	DANTE	I'm not. She just left.
M	RANDAL	What did she say?
M	DANTE	She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
M	RANDAL	You're kidding.
M	DANTE	I'm not.
M	RANDAL	Wow. You've had quite an evening.
M	DANTE	She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
M	RANDAL	I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
M	DANTE	Watch the store while I go home and change.
M	RANDAL	What happened to title dictates behavior?
M	DANTE	This is my way of spitting water at life.
M	RANDAL	Hey, what about Veronica?
M	DANTE	No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
M	RANDAL	You're a snake.
M	DANTE	In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
M	RANDAL	You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
M	DANTE	I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
M	RANDAL	All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
M	DANTE	I'll read the book.
F	CUSTOMER	Cute cat. What's his name.
M	RANDAL	Peptic ulcer.
F	CAITLIN	Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
M	RANDAL	Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
F	CAITLIN	You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
M	RANDAL	I take it she likes the guy.
F	CAITLIN	You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
M	RANDAL	Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
F	CAITLIN	She said not to come home until graduation.
M	RANDAL	Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
F	CAITLIN	What can I say? He does weird things to me.
M	RANDAL	Can I watch?
F	CAITLIN	You can hold me down.
M	RANDAL	Can I join in?
F	CAITLIN	You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
M	RANDAL	Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
F	CAITLIN	A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
M	RANDAL	Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
F	CAITLIN	Dick.
M	RANDAL	Exactly.
F	CAITLIN	So where is he?
M	RANDAL	He went home to change for the big date.
F	CAITLIN	God, isn't he great?
M	RANDAL	No, this is great.
F	CAITLIN	Can I use the bathroom?
M	RANDAL	There's no light back there.
F	CAITLIN	Why aren't there any lights?
M	RANDAL	Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
F	CAITLIN	You're kidding.
M	RANDAL	Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
F	CAITLIN	Such a sordid state of affair.
M	RANDAL	And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
F	CAITLIN	I'll try to manage.
M	RANDAL	Hey Caitlin... Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
F	CAITLIN	You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
M	RANDAL	Territoriality. He was mine first.
F	CAITLIN	Awww. That was so cute.
M	MOTHER	A pack of cigarettes.
M	SMALL CHILD	Cunt!
M	DANTE	Who eats cock?
M	RANDAL	Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
M	DANTE	There's no lights back there.
M	RANDAL	I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
M	DANTE	I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
M	RANDAL	Fuck you.
F	CAITLIN	How'd you get here so fast?
M	DANTE	I left like an hour ago.
F	CAITLIN	Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
M	RANDAL	Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
M	DANTE	Could be.
F	CAITLIN	Promise me it'll always be like that.
M	DANTE	Like what?
F	CAITLIN	When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
M	DANTE	Um... okay.
M	RANDAL	Am I missing something here?
F	CAITLIN	I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
M	RANDAL	He was?
F	CAITLIN	It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know? And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
M	RANDAL	You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
F	CAITLIN	And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... God! That was so great!
M	DANTE	It wasn't me.
F	CAITLIN	Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
M	DANTE	Was it you?
M	RANDAL	I was here the whole time.
F	CAITLIN	You two better quit it.
M	DANTE	I'm serious.
F	CAITLIN	We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
M	DANTE	No.
F	CAITLIN	Stop this. This isn't funny.
M	DANTE	I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
F	CAITLIN	This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
M	DANTE	I'm not fooling around! Who went back there?
M	RANDAL	Nobody! I swear!
F	CAITLIN	I feel nauseous.
M	DANTE	Are you sure somebody was back there?
F	CAITLIN	I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
M	RANDAL	You just fucked a total stranger?
M	DANTE	Shut the fuck up!
F	CAITLIN	I can't believe this! I feel faint...
M	DANTE	Call the police.
M	RANDAL	Why?
F	CAITLIN	No, don't!
M	DANTE	There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
F	CAITLIN	Oh God...
M	RANDAL	She said she did all the work.
M	DANTE	WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
M	CORONER (O.S.)	Who is he?
M	DANTE	I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
M	CORONER	What time was this?
M	DANTE	Um... I don't know. What time did hockey end?
M	RANDAL	Around three or something.
M	DANTE	What time did we go to the funeral?
M	RANDAL	I think four.
M	CORONER	Wait a second? Who was working here today?
M	DANTE	Just me.
M	CORONER	I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
M	DANTE	We did.
M	CORONER	Then who operated the store?
M	DANTE	Nobody. It was closed.
M	CORONER	With this guy locked in?
M	DANTE	Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
M	ATTENDANT 1	Can we take this now?
M	CORONER	Go ahead.
M	DANTE	Was he alive when... Caitlin...
M	CORONER	No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
M	RANDAL	Then how could she... you know...
M	CORONER	The body can maintain an erection after expiration. Sometimes for hours. Did he have the adult magazine when he came in?
M	DANTE	No. I gave it to him.
M	DANTE	Well he asked me for it!
M	CORONER	I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him. Something smells like shoe polish.
M	RANDAL	This has gotta be the weirdest thing you've ever been called in on.
M	CORONER	Actually, I once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis.
M	DANTE	What about Caitlin?
M	CORONER	Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
M	DANTE	She thought it was me.
M	CORONER	What kind of convenience store do you run here?
M	RANDAL	Do you think he was talking about my cousin?
F	JAY	I knew one of those motherfuckers was gonna kill somebody one day.
M	RANDAL (O.S.)	Da-dum! Da-dum! Da-dum! DA-DUM! DA- DUM! DA-DUM!
M	RANDAL	Salsa shark.
M	RANDAL	"We're gonna need a bigger boat."
M	RANDAL	"Man goes into the cage; cage goes into the salsa; shark's in the salsa; our shark."
M	RANDAL	What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
M	DANTE	This life.
M	RANDAL	This life?
M	DANTE	Why do I have this life?
M	RANDAL	Have some chips; you'll feel better.
M	DANTE	I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
M	RANDAL	Thirty-seven.
M	DANTE	My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
M	CUSTOMER (O.S.)	You open?
M	RANDAL	Yeah.
M	RANDAL (O.S.)	That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
M	DANTE	I was born.
M	RANDAL	You should shit or get off the pot.
M	DANTE	I should shit or get off the pot.
M	RANDAL	Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
M	DANTE	What are you talking about?
M	RANDAL	I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
M	DANTE	Fuck you.
M	RANDAL	It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
M	DANTE	What responsibility?
M	RANDAL	All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
M	DANTE	As if it's that easy.
M	RANDAL	It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
M	DANTE	Leave me alone.
M	RANDAL	You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
M	DANTE	Oh, like your life's any better?
M	RANDAL	I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
M	DANTE	Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
M	RANDAL	It's the same thing with Veronica.
M	DANTE	Leave her out of this.
M	RANDAL	You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
M	DANTE	Leave me alone.
M	RANDAL	If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
M	DANTE	...If I wasn't such a fucking coward. It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
M	RANDAL	Am I right or what?
M	DANTE	You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
M	RANDAL	What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
M	DANTE	Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
M	RANDAL	Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
M	DANTE	What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
M	RANDAL	Make them change.
M	DANTE	I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
M	RANDAL	Who're you kidding? You can so.
M	DANTE	Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
M	RANDAL	So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
M	DANTE	My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
M	RANDAL	Lovely story.
M	DANTE	Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
F	JAY	Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke! Drinking beers! A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
M	DANTE	Done poisoning the youth for the day?
F	JAY	Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid. E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
M	DANTE	One seventy-nine.
F	JAY	Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
M	DANTE	A half hour.
F	JAY	We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high?
M	DANTE	I should start.
F	JAY	There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
M	DANTE	With you? I don't think so.
F	JAY	Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
M	DANTE	Nothing personal.
F	JAY	I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
M	DANTE	How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
F	JAY	Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
M	DANTE	It's not my store.
F	JAY	And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
M	DANTE	The difference is you exploit a weakness.
F	JAY	What's that mean?
M	DANTE	You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
F	JAY	All right. How much is Pepsi here?
M	DANTE	A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
F	JAY	At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
M	DANTE	So.
F	JAY	So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
M	DANTE	I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
F	JAY	Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
M	DANTE	He died in the bathroom.
F	JAY	That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
M	DANTE	I don't know. I wasn't watching.
F	JAY	Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her. Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
M	DANTE	Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
F	JAY	You used to go out with her?
M	DANTE	We were going to start again, I think.
F	JAY	Don't you already have a girlfriend?
M	DANTE	Veronica.
F	JAY	Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
M	DANTE	Lasagne.
F	JAY	And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
M	DANTE	Maybe.
F	JAY	I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
M	DANTE	I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
F	JAY	Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
M	DANTE	She's my girlfriend.
F	JAY	I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit. Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
M	DANTE	Meaning?
F	JAY	I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
M	SILENT BOB	You know, there's a million fine- looking women in the world, but they don't all bring you lasagne at work. Most of them just cheat on you.
M	DANTE	He's right. I love her.
M	RANDAL	So that's it. He doesn't love you anymore. He loves Caitlin.
F	VERONICA	And... he told you all of this?
M	RANDAL	Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
F	VERONICA	I... I don't know what to say.
M	RANDAL	Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante. I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
F	VERONICA	I'm not sad.
M	RANDAL	You're not?
F	VERONICA	No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him!
M	RANDAL	He didn't ask me to...
F	VERONICA	After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
M	RANDAL	Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
F	VERONICA	I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
M	RANDAL	Wait! Veronica... I don't think...
M	RANDAL	What am I worried about? He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests. I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
F	CUSTOMER	Oooh! Navy Seals!
M	DANTE	What the fuck did you do that for?
F	VERONICA	If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
M	DANTE	What're you talking about?
F	VERONICA	You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
M	DANTE	It was only a few times...
F	VERONICA	And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
M	DANTE	A couple...?
F	VERONICA	I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
M	DANTE	Would you let me explain...
F	VERONICA	Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
M	DANTE	Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
F	VERONICA	You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine! The slut is yours!
M	DANTE	I don't want Caitlin...
F	VERONICA	You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
M	DANTE	I don't want to go back with her...
F	VERONICA	Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for! I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
M	DANTE	Randal...?
F	VERONICA	And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
M	DANTE	Veronica, I love you...
F	VERONICA	Fuck you.
M	RANDAL	Dante?
M	RANDAL	How's your eye?
M	DANTE	The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
M	RANDAL	It's hard to swallow.
M	RANDAL	You didn't have to choke me.
M	DANTE	Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
M	RANDAL	I thought I was doing you a favor.
M	DANTE	Thanks.
M	RANDAL	You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
M	DANTE	Jesus.
M	RANDAL	You still didn't have to choke me.
M	DANTE	Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
M	RANDAL	Why do you say that?
M	DANTE	Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.
M	RANDAL	No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
M	DANTE	What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
M	RANDAL	How do you figure?
M	DANTE	What time did you get to work today?
M	RANDAL	Like ten after.
M	DANTE	You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
M	RANDAL	To talk to you.
M	DANTE	Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
M	RANDAL	It's not like I'm miles away.
M	DANTE	Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
M	RANDAL	Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
M	DANTE	You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank? You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
M	RANDAL	Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself. "I'm not even supposed to be here today." You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store. Badly, as well. You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us? We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced. Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
M	RANDAL	I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
M	DANTE	You need a ride?
M	RANDAL	Got one. Just pulled up.
M	DANTE	Do you work tomorrow?
M	RANDAL	Same time. What about you?
M	DANTE	I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
M	RANDAL	You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
M	DANTE	I'll call you. Let you know.
M	RANDAL	All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
M	DANTE	No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
M	RANDAL	Helluva day.
M	DANTE	To say the least.
M	RANDAL	Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
M	DANTE	Get the fuck outta here already.
M	RANDAL	I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
