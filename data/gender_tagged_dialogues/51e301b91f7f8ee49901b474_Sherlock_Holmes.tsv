M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WATSON (V.O.)	The year was 1891. London was the capital of the world -- the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained.
M	WATSON (V.O.)	I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady. And that had everything to do with one man. My friend, my partner, my burden...
M	WATSON (V.O.)	... Sherlock Holmes. CONTINUED: 1 The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
M	MAN	Sherlock Holmes?!
M	HOLMES	My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street.
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. First point of attack.
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming.
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker -- knuckles to liver. CONTINUED: 5 SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE CRACK! Karate chop to throat. WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.
M	THUG	What's goin' on, John?
M	HOLMES	Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for? CONTINUED: 7 ANOTHER ANGLE
M	HOLMES	Watson. Perfect timing.
M	WATSON	Nice hat.
M	HOLMES	Just got it. Where's Lestrade?
M	WATSON	Getting his troops in formation. Is that your blood or theirs?
M	HOLMES	I don't know. It's an old shirt.
M	WATSON	You left this behind.
M	HOLMES	Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on.
M	WATSON	You did.
M	HOLMES	Right. Shall we?
M	MAN #1	Des? He can see the hat, but not the man underneath.
M	WATSON	Yeah, s'me. Watson takes out the two men. He is more of a brawler, The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
M	WATSON	The girl. CONTINUED: 9A The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
M	WATSON	Lord Blackwood?! Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.
M	BLACKWOOD	Well done, Holmes. And Watson as well.
M	WATSON	Stay right there.
M	BLACKWOOD	Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work? The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision.
M	HOLMES	No.
M	HOLMES	Look. Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood. Watson looks,
M	HOLMES	Look. invisible --
M	BLACKWOOD	What a shame. That would've been fun.
M	HOLMES	Impeccable timing, Lestrade.
M	LESTRADE	Is that -- ?
M	WATSON	It is.
M	HOLMES	We've gone for the doctor... And one for the rope.
M	LESTRADE	You should've waited for my help.
M	HOLMES	If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance. CONTINUED: (3) 9A Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank
M	LESTRADE	What do you make of that?
M	HOLMES	Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. The double circle's for his own protection.
M	LESTRADE	London will breathe a sigh of relief --
M	WATSON	-- at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As usual.
M	HOLMES	Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar. OMITTED A negative is clipped over the paper. A sudden flash of Autumn has turned to winter.
M	WATSON	71 over 104... very good, Captain.
M	CAPTAIN PHILIPS	Me nerves are the best they been in years, thanks to you. CONTINUED: 12 Watson is pleased by that.
M	CAPTAIN PHILIPS	Tell me something -- your new offices. There won't be so many stairs, I hope?
M	WATSON	No -- ground floor. And there'll be a woman's touch, too. I think we can start to wean you off the medicine --
M	WATSON	Let's give it a little longer, just to be safe. I'll be right back. He heads out, letting his aggravation show once his back
F	MRS. HUDSON	I won't go in there by myself, not while he's in this state.
M	WATSON	You're not going in at all.
F	MRS. HUDSON	What will I do when you leave? He'll burn the house down around me. What will he do? Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
M	WATSON	He just needs a new case, that's all.
M	WATSON	I smell burning.
M	WATSON	Why don't you take Captain Philips and give him a nice cup of tea.
F	MRS. HUDSON	Come on, Captain, let's go down. It'll be quieter.
M	WATSON	And perhaps some tea and bread up here when you can. CONTINUED: 13 Nonetheless, Watson stops, takes a deep breath, gathers
M	WATSON	May I join you in the armory?
M	HOLMES	Please... Watson, I've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot.
M	HOLMES	Please... Don't, don't, don't... It needs work. May I see?...
M	HOLMES	Gently, gently, Watson... WATSON It's been three months since the last case. About time you found another one.
M	HOLMES	I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better.
M	WATSON	Paper?
M	WATSON	Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park -- her husband has gone missing.
M	HOLMES	He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December?
M	WATSON	Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet.
M	HOLMES	Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
M	WATSON	Yes, it's our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
M	WATSON	Mr. Lewis is seeking...
M	HOLMES	There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. I have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister.
F	MRS. HUDSON	Tea, Mr. Holmes.
M	HOLMES	Is it poisoned, nanny?
F	MRS. HUDSON	There's enough of that in you already.
M	HOLMES	Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual.
F	MRS. HUDSON	He's killed the dog... again.
M	WATSON	What have you done to Gladstone this time?
M	HOLMES	I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind.
M	WATSON	Holmes! As your doctor...
M	HOLMES	He'll be right as a trivet in no time. WATSON ... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here.
M	HOLMES	There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all.
M	WATSON	So, you have nothing to do?
M	HOLMES	Nothing.
M	WATSON	Then you're free this evening.
M	HOLMES	Absolutely.
M	WATSON	For dinner.
M	HOLMES	Wonderful.
M	WATSON	The Royale.
M	HOLMES	My favorite.
M	WATSON	Mary's coming.
M	HOLMES	Not available.
M	WATSON	You're meeting her, Holmes.
M	HOLMES	Have you proposed yet?
M	WATSON	I'm still looking for the right ring.
M	HOLMES	Then it's not official. WATSON It's happening, like it or not. Half past eight. The Royale.
M	WATSON	And wear a jacket.
M	WATSON	Holmes! You're early. HOLMES Fashionably.
M	WATSON	May I present Miss Mary Morstan.
M	HOLMES	My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced.
F	MARY	The pleasure's mine. It really is a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes. I've a whole stack of detective novels at home. Poe, Wilkie Collins... WATSON It's true. MARY They can seem a bit far-fetched sometimes, though. Making these grand assumptions out of tiny details.
M	HOLMES	Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take Watson...
F	MARY	I intend to.
M	HOLMES	... see that walking-stick? A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets... ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler. I'd keep an eye on that, by the way.
M	WATSON	Those days are behind me.
M	HOLMES	Yes, right behind you. He's cost us the rent more than once.
F	MARY	With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know him. But what about a perfect stranger? What can you tell about me?
M	WATSON	I don't think that's necessary -- HOLMES Yes, I doubt --
F	MARY	No, it'd be wonderful. I insist.
M	HOLMES	You insist? She insisted. You're a governess.
F	MARY	Well done.
M	WATSON	Yes, well done. So shall we --
M	HOLMES	Your student's a boy of 8.
F	MARY	Charlie's 7, actually.
M	HOLMES	It's breathing. Then he's tall for his age. HOLMES He flicked ink at you today.
F	MARY	Is there ink on my face?
M	WATSON	There's nothing wrong with your face.
M	WAITER	The gentleman has already ordered for himself. What would madam care for this evening?
M	WATSON	Give us a few minutes, please.
M	HOLMES	There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly -- which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess. However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more. WATSON Holmes.
M	HOLMES	You were engaged.
M	HOLMES	The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly.
M	HOLMES	Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps.
F	MARY	Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance... he died. WATSON Well done, old man.
M	HOLMES	She's lovely.
M	HOLMES	Well done. Thank you.
M	McMURDO	Oi! We ain't done here.
M	HOLMES	Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable. CONTINUED: (2) 15A-17
M	HOLMES	Hm. Plymouth gin.
M	GUARD CAPTAIN	Charlie, what the hell's going on down here? CONTINUED: 18A CHARLIE It's Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from doing his spells. And now he's in some kind of fit.
M	GUARD CAPTAIN	You lot shut it! Charlie, get, down here and get him to the infirmary.
M	GUARD CAPTAIN	All right, Blackwood, what's this all about?
M	BLACKWOOD	I've a request. GUARD CAPTAIN You don't get nothin' `til you stop this devil nonsense. That's a holy book --
M	GUARD CAPTAIN	-- and you will respect it!
M	GUARD CAPTAIN	Boy, you want me to muzzle you -- CONTINUED: 19 Blackwood keeps whispering. The Captain falls to one GUARD #2 Get him to the infirmary, now!
M	BLACKWOOD	I've a request. Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
M	WATSON	You know this is for eye surgery?
M	HOLMES	I find that it lifts my spirits.
M	WATSON	It's a pathological amorbic process, it increases tissue change and weakness. And you know what a black reaction comes on you afterwards. HOLMES Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale --
M	WATSON	Really? What about when you -- oops -- WATSON Let's go. Lestrade wants you at Pentonville Prison.
M	HOLMES	That's your job, not mine.
M	WATSON	You're Blackwood's last request. Says he has information he'll give only to you.
M	HOLMES	Look at that structure. What has it been? Five years' work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative. CONTINUED: 23
M	HOLMES	Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary bet --
M	HOLMES	You're right... I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer.
M	HOLMES	The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening.
M	HOLMES	You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
M	WATSON	And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. I was aware she'd been engaged. She told me. Holmes rubs his jaw.
M	HOLMES	So that's a `no' to the opera then?
M	WATSON	That's my waistcoat.
M	HOLMES	It's too small for you.
M	WATSON	Well, it's my property and I want it back. Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses
M	WATSON	You go ahead. I've no business with him while he's alive.
M	HOLMES	Where are all the other prisoners?
M	GUARD	We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands. There's something about him... it's like he can get inside your head.
M	HOLMES	I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to.
M	GUARD	Much obliged, sir. Thank you, thank you. insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's closer. BLACKWOOD QUOTE from Revelations tbd...
M	HOLMES	Love what you've done with the place.
M	BLACKWOOD	Thank you for joining me. HOLMES A small point of concern.
M	BLACKWOOD	How can I help?
M	HOLMES	I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush --
M	BLACKWOOD	You're too kind.
M	HOLMES	However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting.
M	BLACKWOOD	So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here.
M	HOLMES	Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company.
M	BLACKWOOD	Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all -- I am merely the channel. HOLMES My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives.
M	BLACKWOOD	Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
M	HOLMES	I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too.
M	BLACKWOOD	Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. For you and I are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. I sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes, I need you.
M	HOLMES	I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
M	BLACKWOOD	But I will rise again.
M	HOLMES	Bon voyage, Blackwood.
M	BLACKWOOD	Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them. You must accept that this is beyond your control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought in your head.
M	LESTRADE	What did he want?
M	HOLMES	Nothing.
M	HOLMES	Don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one. The room where the execution takes place is packed to the CONTINUED: 29 A SHOT OF BLACKWOOD
M	BLACKWOOD	Death is only the beginning. Holmes is out cold, lying on his tiger skin rug.
M	IRENE (O.S.)	London's so bleak this time of year. CONTINUED: 30 REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the stairs near Holmes' lab,
F	IRENE	Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.
F	IRENE	I prefer to travel in the winter.
F	IRENE	I brought a few souvenirs. Dates from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and olives from Cyclades. I thought we'd have a little tea party to cheer us up.
F	IRENE	I came across this as I was setting up.
F	IRENE	Theft of Velasquez portrait from the King of Spain... Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian Prime Minister... Scandalous affair ends engagement of Hapsburg Prince to Romanov Princess. HOLMES Simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
F	IRENE	I don't see my name anywhere.
M	HOLMES	But your signature is clear.
M	HOLMES	Ah, the Maharajah's missing diamond. Another souvenir?
F	IRENE	He has a palace full of them. Let's not dwell on the past.
F	IRENE	By the looks of things you're between cases at the moment.
M	HOLMES	And you, husbands. No ring?
F	IRENE	He snored. I'm Irene Adler again and I need your help to find someone. There's nobody more brilliant or who knows London better than you. Plus, it's a wonderful opportunity to see you again.
F	IRENE	Why are you so suspicious?
M	HOLMES	Should I answer chronologically or alphabetically? IRENE This is all the information you need.
M	HOLMES	Who are you working for?
F	IRENE	I'm my own man. CONTINUED: (4) 30 She stands and pulls out a large bag of coins.
M	HOLMES	Keep your money. I didn't say I'd take the case.
F	IRENE	They gave me our old room.
F	IRENE	Hello, John. Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling
M	MORIARTY	I assume he'll do it?
F	IRENE	Not for money, but for me. I wager he'll find our man within twenty-four hours.
M	MORIARTY	You wager? CONTINUED: 33 IRENE I'm certain.
M	MORIARTY	A better word. I sincerely hope it's accurate.
F	IRENE	I --
M	BEGGAR	Ow, me leg! COACH DRIVER Get out of it!
M	BEGGAR	You run me over, sir, yes you did!
M	COACH DRIVER	You fell right into the carriage! teeth.
M	BEGGAR	A little charity would go a long way, yes it would, sir. CONTINUED: (2) 34 He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond,
M	WATSON	Look at you, I can't believe you ran after her like a schoolboy again. Leaping about, all aflutter. Are you a masochist?
M	HOLMES	Allow me to explain.
M	WATSON	Don't you remember what she did to you? She turned you inside out, she made a proper idiot of you. I'm sorry, you were going to explain something...
M	HOLMES	Thank you, I --
M	WATSON	I know, instead of just being tricked into being a witness at her wedding like last time --
M	HOLMES	I don't believe --
M	WATSON	You dress up as clergyman and actually perform the ceremony. She'd love that.
M	HOLMES	You've had your fun.
M	WATSON	What's she after, anyway? HOLMES Now it's time to press on.
M	HOLMES	Now it's time to press on.
M	WATSON	Go on. I won't interrupt.
M	HOLMES	It doesn't matter --
M	WATSON	What could she possibly need? An alibi, a beard, a human canoe. She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames...
M	HOLMES	Regrettably, we've had our last case together. Those are my dates.
M	WATSON	I've already read it. Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth.
M	WATSON	Case solved! You're just not her type, Holmes. She likes ginger dwarfs.
M	HOLMES	Midget!
M	WATSON	So you agree?
M	HOLMES	No, I don't agree. It's more than a technicality. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people.
M	WATSON	I've upset you, I can tell. I've said too much. HOLMES No, I'm just saying, one has disproportionate limbs the other does not.
M	WATSON	Alright. What were you just doing?
M	HOLMES	Will you allow me to explain.
M	WATSON	That's what I've been trying to do.
F	IRENE	Why don't I see myself out.
M	MAN WITH ROSES	Got some roses for you, sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos you're so pretty.
F	IRENE	Oh, how nice of you.
M	38B	The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another IRENE Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look like yours, does it? And -- naughty boy -- here's another one. I'll return them, shall I?
F	IRENE	These are lovely, thank you.
M	HOLMES	Now, that's the Irene I know. Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
M	HOLMES	This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge.
M	WATSON	Which is no mean feat.
M	HOLMES	She's intimidated, scared...
M	WATSON	And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case.
M	HOLMES	Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own.
M	WATSON	You know what, I've had just about enough --
M	HOLMES	Clarky! Mister Holmes, sir...?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, at once. HOLMES What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us.
M	WATSON	Us means you.
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It appears he's come back from the dead.
M	WATSON	Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself.
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	A groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning.
M	WATSON	I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.
M	HOLMES	It is not my reputation at stake here.
M	WATSON	Are you taking this seriously?
M	HOLMES	Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
M	HOLMES	Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked.
M	WATSON	Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled. HOLMES Scotland Yard at their finest, once again. CONTINUED: (2) 42 Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves
M	LESTRADE	Look at those slabs of marble -- they're half a ton each if they're a pound -- smashed outward like they were nothing.
M	LESTRADE	Explain it if you can, Holmes.
M	HOLMES	And the coffin?
M	LESTRADE	We're digging it up now. The witness is over there. You can question him if you like -- but you won't get much. each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want
M	LESTRADE	If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time! You're an embarrassment! Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. Are we bloody clear on that? THE GROUNDSKEEPER
M	WATSON	He's in shock. We should give him a few moments.
M	LESTRADE	The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave. Well? You pronounced the man dead.
M	WATSON	He had no pulse. HOLMES Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore? themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes chuckles.
M	LESTRADE	OPEN IT!! But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if forward --
M	LESTRADE	That's not Blackwood.
M	HOLMES	Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious...
M	WATSON	Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately -- -- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago.
M	HOLMES	Inspector, may I see your pen?
M	WATSON	Missing two incisors in the upper jaw... Adler's midget.
M	HOLMES	All yours, Inspector. CONTINUED: (5) 42 Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt.
M	HOLMES	Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner --
M	GROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.)	He was walking.
M	GROUNDSKEEPER	He was walking but his feet didn't touch the ground. And I'm not daft, I know what I saw and I know Lord Blackwood. He was as alive as you or me. It's not right. It's not natural. Our Father Who art in heaven...
M	HOLMES	Now the game is afoot, Watson.
M	WATSON	I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way.
M	HOLMES	Trust me. WATSON Just eat.
M	WATSON	You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible. HOLMES Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this.
M	HOLMES	Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?
M	WATSON	The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.
M	HOLMES	Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own.
M	HOLMES	Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid.
M	WATSON	Pawnbroker's marks.
M	HOLMES	Excellent.
M	HOLMES	The most recent is M.H...
M	WATSON	Maddison and Haig. HOLMES Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address.
M	WATSON	There's one thing you've missed. On the watch.
M	HOLMES	I think not.
M	WATSON	The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you.
M	PALM READER	Reckon your future, sir?
M	HOLMES	Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond.
M	WATSON	No, thank you.
M	PALM READER	You need to hear what I have to tell you.
M	PALM READER	I see two men, brothers. Not in blood but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no... wait, a J. PALM READER I see madness. A man driven out of his mind by a malign force.
M	PALM READER	I see a letter... the letter M... another M... Mary? You will be married... I see... I see... Patterned table clothes, china figurines, lace doilies...
M	WATSON	You think you are clever don't you?
M	PALM READER	She turns to fat...
M	WATSON	Enough.
M	HOLMES	Do you have any changes?
M	WATSON	This is a new low -- even for you. HOLMES It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.
M	WATSON	Do you still have my cut from the fight?
M	HOLMES	Why, do you --
M	PALM READER	I seen something in his hand. Darkness and great pain. Mortal peril. Warn your friend, he's not safe. Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop
M	WATSON	Not bad, eh?
M	HOLMES	Reordon's lodgings should be right around this bend. Here we are... CONTINUED: 52 He slows, looks up at a dark, dingy LODGING HOUSE. Some
M	HOLMES	Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh, well, give my regards to Mary. CONTINUED: (2) 52
M	WATSON	I can spare ten minutes. The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms.
M	HOLMES	He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
M	WATSON	Something did. CONTINUED: 55 Watson, come take a look at this --
M	WATSON	Bloody hell...
M	HOLMES	Ammonium sulfate.
M	HOLMES	Phosphorous... Formaldehyde... Hemlock...
M	WATSON	Appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.
M	WATSON	Has he any hydrochloric acid? CONTINUED: 56 Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson.
M	HOLMES	Irene was here.
M	WATSON	Why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself?
M	HOLMES	Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. Something he was working on?
M	WATSON	Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt...
M	WATSON	He worked for Blackwood.
M	HOLMES	There's one odor I can't put my finger on. Sweet, almost like perfume... or sugar.... Barley sugar. CONTINUED: 58 They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of
M	HOLMES	Hello, gentlemen.
M	DREDGER	Sherlock Holmes.
M	HOLMES	Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man.
M	DREDGER	You do like to talk.
M	HOLMES	You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth.
M	WATSON	Seems about fair. Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for CONTINUED: 58B Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts OMITTED CONTINUED: 63 ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with pursuit. A police WHISTLE echoes through the air. Dredger turns
M	WATSON	Holmes! We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the find: CONTINUED: 66A Nothing. No blood or trace. The big man is gone.
M	WATSON	I haven't slept all night. I deserve this... I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail.
M	HOLMES	You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self- defense.
M	WATSON	I've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and I've come to the conclusion that I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration. Why else would I continually allow myself to be led into situations where you're deliberately withholding your intentions from me?
M	HOLMES	You've never complained about my methods before.
M	WATSON	I'm not complaining... I never complain... I never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on fire!
M	HOLMES	That was an accident...
M	HOLMES	The first time WAS an accident...
M	BIG MAN (O.S.)	Remember me, boys? Put me away for robbery a few years back?
M	HOLMES	Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London.
M	WATSON	Who could forget that face? I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us! WATSON Nor am I complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog.
M	HOLMES	Gladstone's my dog as well. It's in the interest of science.
M	WATSON	What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
M	HOLMES	Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive. What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit.
M	WATSON	If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife --
M	HOLMES	Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well.
M	WATSON	No, Holmes. Not you. Me and her. You're not --
M	HOLMES	Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home? WATSON You're not human. You don't get it, do you? You are this... ... without this.
M	PRISON GUARD	John Watson? You made bail.
M	PRISON GUARD	Just Watson. Lestrade heads toward the holding room, flanked by prison CONTINUED: 68 As the door is opened, the thug blasts out backwards,
M	HOLMES	Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing.
M	LESTRADE	You know, in another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal.
M	HOLMES	And you, sir, an excellent policeman. RESURRECTED!"
M	LESTRADE	Tell me you have answers.
M	HOLMES	All in good time.
M	LESTRADE	We don't have time. I've an office full of policemen hanging crosses over their desks. A public that's working itself into a frenzy... Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open.
M	HOLMES	Who's this?
M	LESTRADE	Try to behave yourself. They just paid a small fortune to bail you out. ANONYMOUS MAN I'm afraid you'll have to put this on.
M	SIR THOMAS	Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I am.
M	HOLMES	As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on?
M	HOLMES	As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely. HOLMES Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square. And as to the mystery -- the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place.
M	SIR THOMAS	Yes, well, it's standard procedure, I suppose.
M	STANDISH (O.S.)	I think we have the right man. SIR THOMAS Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary.
M	LORD COWARD	I suppose you already have some notion as to the -- practices of our Order?
M	HOLMES	Yes. They're almost interesting.
M	SIR THOMAS	Be as skeptical as you like -- but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries. The danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes.
M	LORD COWARD	What some call the dark arts, or practical magic.
M	STANDISH	We know you're are a rationalist. We don't ask you to share our faith, only our fears. Fear is the more infectious condition. In this case, fear of your own child.
M	HOLMES	Blackwood is your son, yes? You have the same colored irises -- a rare dark green, with diamond- shaped hazel flecks -- -- plus identical outer ears, or pinna, which only pass down through the direct bloodline, which would make you either brothers, or, more likely, father and son.
M	SIR THOMAS	Very few people are privy to that information, and we want to keep it that way.
M	SIR THOMAS	He was conceived during one of our rituals. His mother wasn't my wife, but she shared our beliefs. She was a powerful practitioner. Though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
M	SIR THOMAS	We were young. It was before we fully understood the powers we were dealing with.
M	HOLMES	Evidently.
M	SIR THOMAS	Death followed him wherever he went, from his birth to arms he made and sold. What family he had tended to... not survive. No one could prove anything of course, but we all knew --
M	SIR THOMAS	The boy was a curse. I didn't have the courage either to take him in or to -- STANDISH All this is history. The present and future are worse.
M	SIR THOMAS	We've done our best to stop him ourselves, but it's not enough.
M	LORD COWARD	His power grows daily and exponentially. His resurrection is evidence of that. What he does next will be far more dangerous --
M	SIR THOMAS	-- he's going to raise a force that will alter the very course of our world. We need you to find him and stop him before he does.
M	LORD COWARD	We'll give you any assistance we can. As Home Secretary, I have considerable influence over the police. Name your price.
M	HOLMES	One of the great benefits of my work is that I can pick and choose my clients. I'll get him, but not for you.
M	HOLMES	I have one last question, Sir Thomas.
M	SIR THOMAS	What is it?
M	HOLMES	If the rest of his family's dead, why are you still alive? OMITTED
F	IRENE	If you're going to watch me take my clothes off, Sherlock, the least you can do is help me with the buttons.
F	IRENE	To watch a lady undress without her permission is a criminal offense, Sherlock, and could get you into a lot of trouble...
F	IRENE	So why don't you come over here and help me instead.
F	IRENE	That's better.
M	HOLMES	You can stop looking for Reardon.
F	IRENE	I knew I could count on you. HOLMES He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.
F	IRENE	Wonderful. Case closed then. Your services are no longer required.
M	HOLMES	I can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results? You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor perhaps?
F	IRENE	The eye patch was a nice touch.
M	HOLMES	But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption.
M	IRENE (O.S.)	Let's not argue.
M	HOLMES	We're not.
M	HOLMES	Tell me who you're working for and what he's after.
F	IRENE	That's nobody's business but my own. HOLMES I disagree.
F	IRENE	You see, we are arguing.
M	HOLMES	When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time.
F	IRENE	This wine is excellent. You should really try some.
M	HOLMES	So what's it to be?
F	IRENE	Do we really have to decide now?
M	HOLMES	You're in over your head this time, Irene. IRENE That's better.
F	IRENE	Much better.
F	IRENE	This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock -- one in shackles, the other with the key.
F	IRENE	I've NEVER been in over my head.
M	HOLMES	How can you live like this -- always a fugitive.
F	IRENE	But free. And on my own terms. Just like you -- well, not you at this exact moment -- CONTINUED: (4) 75 She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the
F	IRENE	-- but generally speaking.
F	IRENE	If anyone asks, please let them know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have time to check out. I hope you don't mind settling the bill. What were you doing consorting with a married business traveller in his hotel room is something you'll have to explain for yourself.
F	IRENE	
M	PERIGRINE	Good evening, sir. Some figs and honey with a nice glass of port? I've prepared a tray.
M	SIR THOMAS	No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going to bed. You won't let those figs go to waste, will you? PERIGRINE Nor the port, sir. Hello, Father...
M	BLACKWOOD	You can't fight it. It comes from a power greater than yours. You can only surrender.
M	BLACKWOOD	I've been imagining this moment for a long time...
M	BLACKWOOD	... I must admit, it's better than I thought it would be. Carrying an armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key
M	HOLMES	Don't take this the wrong way, but might I borrow your hand?
M	HOLMES	Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely. CONTINUED: 78A This is why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling, there is no latitude for misunderstanding.
M	HOLMES	Faith runs riot over reason.
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	Well, it's a good thing she was offended or we'd never have found you. The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning. Holmes steps out of the coach, and is escorted inside by
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	We've checked everything. No sign of a break-in. The Butler didn't hear anything. The body was in the tub, eyes wide open -- -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	-- only his ring was missing. HOLMES Why did you drain the water?
M	POLICE OFFICER	Out of common decency.
M	HOLMES	Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse.
M	HOLMES	Hmm...
M	HOLMES	What is that?
M	POLICE OFFICER	Uhhhh... jasmine?
M	HOLMES	Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own.
M	HOLMES	Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay!
M	65B.	CONTINUED: (2) 78C His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He CONTINUED: (3) 78C FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels. -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer
M	HOLMES	I have no idea what to make of that. Excellent work. HOLMES Don't forget the wallpaper.
M	WATSON	There isn't any.
M	HOLMES	Figure of speech.
M	HOLMES	Since this room is no longer in use, do you mind if I employ it?
M	WATSON	Be my guest.
M	HOLMES	Bring him in, boys. WATSON Who was he?
M	HOLMES	My new roommate. He's an inspiring conversationalist.
M	WATSON	Really.
M	HOLMES	No, he's your friend from Reordon's. He didn't survive Dredger landing on him. Poor fellow. But there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men. HOLMES Elbows and arms stained with blood, but older than his own injuries. Plenty of it, layer on layer...
M	HOLMES	Though none of it human.
M	HOLMES	A butcher perhaps...? What else?
M	HOLMES	Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin.
M	HOLMES	Coal... river silt...
M	HOLMES	That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in...
M	WATSON	Nine Elms.
M	HOLMES	Well done. Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you? HOLMES See what Blackwood admits to owning.
M	WATSON	It's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you. HOLMES Something brutal by the river...
M	WATSON	Woolwich Arsenal... Limehouse Chemical... Queenshithe Slaughterhouse, Nine Elms!
M	HOLMES	That's it, Watson! This should lead us right to Blackwood.
M	WATSON	Not us, you.
M	HOLMES	Right. Well uh... best of luck with everything, then.
M	WATSON	Same to you.
M	WATSON	Not again.
M	WATSON	Yes, I know. Don't give me that look, Gladstone. CONTINUED: 82A A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised
M	STANDISH	What's the meaning of this? Why did you call us here?
M	LORD COWARD	Sir Thomas is dead. Effective immediately, I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the Order.
M	STANDISH	Are you mad, Coward? Have you any idea what he's capable of?
M	BLACKWOOD (O.S.)	Of course he does. It's why he's here.
M	BLACKWOOD	I am humbled. I am honored. My powers and my assets -- munitions, shipping, industry -- they were given to me for a purpose. A magnificent and simple purpose. A different future... a future ruled by us.
M	BLACKWOOD	You've made policy in secret for centuries. Now, you'll make it openly.
M	BLACKWOOD	The first act is a necessary one, for without death there can be no rebirth... ... at noon tomorrow, we will take the first step towards a new chapter in history. England will know our power. Then, the whole world will. Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours, and will be again. Their civil war weakened them; their government is as corrupt and ineffective as ours. We'll take it from them. With their resources and our power, we'll remake the world, we'll create the future. Are you with me?
M	STANDISH	No, sir, we are not! The powers he's playing with are beyond any man's control.
M	BLACKWOOD	They're limitless -- even death holds no sway.
M	STANDISH	Help me stop him before it's too late. CONTINUED: (2) 83 In desperation, Standish pulls a gun. But as he aims it
M	BLACKWOOD	I wouldn't do that. Blackwood turns away from the window, surveys them. They CONTINUED: 83B
M	BLACKWOOD	Come, drink your allegiance here. BLACKWOOD You control the police. Use them.
M	HOLMES	Everything all right, Captain Tanner?
M	TANNER	Just a little leak, nothing to worry about.
M	TANNER	Not a great one for the water, are you, doctor? Army type, aren't you? You wouldn't have lasted long in the Navy.
M	TANNER	That's as far as we can go.
M	WATSON	There must be fifty yards of mud out there. HOLMES Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the police when you get there.
M	WATSON	I know precisely how much money is in there.
M	TANNER	I am sure you do, doctor. OMITTED
M	HOLMES	What are you doing with my gun?
M	WATSON	Oh, please.
M	HOLMES	It was an honest mistake --
M	WATSON	There was nothing honest about it.
M	WATSON	Come on, let's get this over with. CONTINUED: 86 They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes
M	HOLMES	The one on the left seems more attentive, might prove easily distracted. The big one's been drinking -- whether for courage or from habit... Watson? OMITTED through it.

M	WATSON	One-eighteen. It's a date, a time?
M	HOLMES	It's chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I am He that liveth, and was dead.'
M	BLACKWOOD (O.S.)	`And behold, I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death. Amen.' BLACKWOOD I cautioned you to accept that this is beyond your control. Now you see the truth for yourself.
M	BLACKWOOD	I want you to bear witness. At noon tomorrow, the world as you know it ends. BLACKWOOD And because I appreciate your help, Holmes, I have a gift for you.
M	BLACKWOOD	She followed you. You led your little lamb straight to slaughter.
M	HOLMES	It's your turn in shackles this time. CONTINUED: 90A IRENE But this time no key, unfortunately.
M	HOLMES	I've been meaning to ask you something --
F	IRENE	Well, I'm a captive audience. CONTINUED: (2) 90A She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes
F	IRENE	You had a question.
M	HOLMES	Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain you're not in over your head?
F	IRENE	In some countries steam is considered excellent therapy for the skin.
F	IRENE	I have to say -- it's overrated. -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
F	IRENE	Sherlock? Gets a free haircut.
F	IRENE	Thank you so much. I owe you.
M	HOLMES	You owe me information. No more games, Irene.
F	IRENE	Blackwood's manufactured large- scale weapons for years. Lately there've been rumors of something new. More powerful than anything else. And... magical. My job is to find out if the rumors are true. I would say they are.
M	HOLMES	Watson!
M	WATSON	Holmes...
M	HOLMES	WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!! knocking him to the ground. CONTINUED: 91 We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	There's an order for your arrest all the way from the top, sir -- so you'll have to hit me now.
M	HOLMES	From Lord Coward?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	Yes, sir, so make it look good.
M	HOLMES	Thank you, Clarky. Two POLICEMEN half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor. Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room, CONTINUED: 93 Watson is burned, cut, bruised, scraped, pock-marked with CONTINUED: (2) 93
M	WATSON	What are you administering?
M	DOCTOR	Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for the pain.
M	DOCTOR	There are four pieces of shrapnel. The surgeon should be along shortly.
M	WATSON	Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?
M	DOCTOR	They're near the carotid artery.
M	WATSON	Get a mirror, I'll extract them myself.
M	DOCTOR	I can't authorize that, Doctor. We must first manage the pain and combat the infection.
M	WATSON	I haven't time for that. My friend is in dire --
M	DOCTOR	Your friend? What kind of friend takes a retired soldier, who's served his country and deserves a peaceful, private life, and puts him so directly in harm's -- WATSON The best and wisest man I've ever known.
M	DOCTOR	But evidently not wise enough to value your life over his misadventures.
M	WATSON	It was worth a wound, worth many wounds...
F	MARY	Excuse me --
M	DOCTOR	I have other... patients.
F	MARY	Do you really? Doctor.
F	MARY	You have nothing more to say to me?
M	DOCTOR	Um... I'll check in on him again shortly.
F	MARY	Is that the best you can do? I'm disappointed, but not surprised.
F	MARY	If anything happens to him, both our lives are lost. Do you understand that? Can you? -- CONTINUED: (4) 93 The Doctor can't face her anger any longer, turns, leaves
F	MARY	-- or are you so selfish that's just not possible. CONTINUED: 95 Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
M	BLACKWOOD (O.S.)	And now it dawns on you, you begin to recognize your part in his play.
M	BLACKWOOD	You see the path he chose for you. BLACKWOOD Didn't you wonder why it was so easy to catch me? I told you I needed five lives for my resurrection. Why would I take a sixth under St. Paul's?
M	BLACKWOOD	Unless I simply wanted to be caught by the great Sherlock Holmes...
M	BLACKWOOD	... so I could die on the biggest stage of all. You made me what I am. CONTINUED: 97 THE STUFF IN REORDON'S ROOM.
M	HOLMES	Watson...?
M	WATSON	Interesting artwork. You look bloody awful.
M	HOLMES	What about the shrapnel in your arm?
M	WATSON	Took it out myself. Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
M	HOLMES	She brought you here?
M	WATSON	Yes, oddly, it seems she might understand the power of partnership. HOLMES The fair sex was always your department, Watson.
M	HOLMES	Thank you. You know, I dreamt that you were strangling me.
F	IRENE	I was... I had to get you to pass out to settle down.
M	HOLMES	What time is it?
M	WATSON	It's half past nine.
M	HOLMES	Excellent brew, but I believe my head requires something a bit stronger to clear the --
M	WATSON	I brought you this...
M	HOLMES	Exactly.
F	IRENE	Oh, I poisoned that one.
M	WATSON	With your own venom no doubt.
F	IRENE	Better a snake than a lap dog.
M	WATSON	There's a new field in the treatment of abnormal personalities -- it's called psychology. It appears you're what's considered a para-neurotic deviant with anti-social proclivities. Quite severe. And untreatable.
F	IRENE	No, doctor, I'm simply a woman. Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage.
F	IRENE	Not quite, doctor. Let me make it simple for you, with a lot fewer words -- I'm what's called a woman. Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage. The music stops. Irene and Watson notice the silence.
M	HOLMES	I need a map of London.
M	HOLMES	Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own.
M	WATSON	At minimum.
M	HOLMES	My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended.
F	IRENE	Yes, your little white tail got rather dirty.
M	HOLMES	But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power --
M	HOLMES	It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man -- CONTINUED: 102 He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
M	HOLMES	In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map!
M	HOLMES	Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system. through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor.
M	HOLMES	Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here...
M	HOLMES	Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here... HOLMES Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years -- and not by coincidence.
M	HOLMES	The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here...
M	WATSON	Man, Ox, Eagle...
M	WATSON	And last on the list: the Lion. Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene
M	HOLMES	Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here.
M	WATSON	Parliament.
F	IRENE	What is the meaning of this circle? the middle of the river.
M	HOLMES	It is the fifth element -- the ethereal. That which can't yet be known. WATSON It's right in the middle of the River Thames.
F	IRENE	Police.
M	HOLMES	Ladies first.
M	HOLMES	Follow these plans. Holmes races down the hall toward the back door, but the CONTINUED: 104 The carriage pulls up. Crowds are gathering outside,
M	LORD COWARD	Lestrade?
M	LESTRADE	Begging your pardon, m'lord, I know it's unorthodox, but Mr. Holmes has been making serious accusations about you and the order, sir.
M	HOLMES	Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.
M	LORD COWARD	I have five minutes before my next engagement, why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracies. Thank you, Lestrade, if you could wait outside. HOLMES I'm curious, Coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders or just the one I prevented? Very distinctive those hand-made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave.
M	HOLMES	Nonetheless, I confess to being completely out-matched. I could deduce very little from my investigation.
M	HOLMES	Fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today? Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion is parliament, isn't it?
M	LORD COWARD	Very clever. But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd. Don't you see it's for their own good?
M	HOLMES	No, but I don't care much what you think. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me.
M	LORD COWARD	I have told you nothing. CONTINUED: (2) 106 A pair of handcuffs, slide across the floor to Coward's
M	But your clothes say infinitely	more than you ever hope. The mud smeared on your boots from where you've been walking...
M	SERIES OF FLASHBACKS	Coward's heel walking through mud.
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	A touch of red stock brick dust on your knee, from where you've been kneeling...
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing...
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	A faint aroma of excrement, from where you have been standing.
M	LORD COWARD (V.O.)	It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes, you would have made a valuable ally. The powers at our disposal are far greater than you can imagine.
M	HOLMES (V.O.)	You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour ago.
M	HOLMES (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Both Houses met today. The entire government will be present.
M	LORD COWARD	How terrible is wisdom, Holmes, when it brings no profit to the wise. We take power at noon.
M	HOLMES	Well there's no time to waste then, is there? SPLASH! Holmes dives into the river handcuffed. He CONTINUED: 107 Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
M	TANNER	I told you he'd be coming out the top window, soldier boy. No way he'd be coming over the terrace.
M	WATSON	How was Lestrade?
M	HOLMES	Performed his role perfectly. A little too perfectly, come to think of it.
M	WATSON	Well, your instructions were fairly precise... about everything except the window.
F	IRENE	Where to, Sherlock?
M	HOLMES	Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers.
M	HOLMES	Watson, did you bring my clothes? Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
F	IRENE	Starting early, aren't we?
M	HOLMES	Trust me, have a drink.
M	WATSON	What are we doing in the sewers?
M	HOLMES	Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you... Expensive carriages fill the courtyard. The entire government is here. We see familiar faces from the
M	TANNER	Far as I can go. CONTINUED: 110 Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson
M	HOLMES	Behold, Blackwood's magic.
M	HOLMES	A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.
M	WATSON	You can tell that from here?
M	HOLMES	No. I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket: the RAT TAIL.
M	HOLMES	I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide.
M	HOLMES	That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas.
F	IRENE	All of the people inside that building --
M	WATSON	Will be dead at the strike of noon. HOLMES As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control. OMITTED

M	HOLMES	I wouldn't.
M	WATSON	I'll keep these under wraps. HOLMES Take this.
M	WATSON	Over there.
F	IRENE	I've never seen anything like it.
M	HOLMES	There's never been anything like it. A totally wire-free weapon. He must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite -- Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes
M	HOLMES	Keep at it.
M	LORD COWARD	Look. The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard CONTINUED: 114 Nine strokes left.
M	WATSON	You owe me for the ring.
M	HOLMES	Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the bullets. -- which shatters against the floor. Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of
M	HOLMES	We need a light, a match --
F	IRENE	Got it... Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them
F	IRENE	Three. ON THE DEVICE AS IT GOES ACTIVE
M	WATSON (O.S.)	Hey! through-and-through) --
F	IRENE	Two! BLACKWOOD You seem surprised. Did you really take me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant? I see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption. I am here to change all this.
M	BLACKWOOD	I am the fourth horseman.
M	BLACKWOOD	I am the pale rider.
M	BLACKWOOD	And my name to you is death. ZZZZP! The electrical charge zaps through the device,
F	IRENE	That was something new for us.
M	HOLMES	Yes... it was.
F	IRENE	Watson -- CONTINUED: 118 Holmes whips around -- sees Watson, seemingly dead. He
M	WATSON	I'm pretty sure I heard the last chime.
M	HOLMES	Yes, we made it. Just.
M	HOLMES	Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this.
M	WATSON	Which part? The stench of the sewers or the broken bones? My ankle's done.
M	WATSON	Where's Irene?
M	WATSON	Holmes, I'm sorry...
M	HOLMES	Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact. Blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official spiralling even further down. Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower -- The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the (unfinished) window --
M	SHERLOCK	Woman! Sherlock appears behind her, winded.
M	SHERLOCK	It's bad manners to leave without at least saying `goodbye.'
F	IRENE	Goodbye!
F	IRENE	You of all people know I will pull this trigger. CONTINUED: 119H
F	IRENE	I'd tell you I'm sorry, that I wish things could be different but you wouldn't believe me anyway.
M	HOLMES	Why hurry off, give it a try.
M	BLACKWOOD	You're better off without her, Holmes!
M	BLACKWOOD	I planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong... but now because of you thousands are going to die.
M	BLACKWOOD	All I have to do is break this cylinder. The wind will do the rest. And you'll be the first.
M	110A.	Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
M	HOLMES	There was never any magic. Only conjuring tricks.
M	HOLMES	The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard...
M	HOLMES	Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
M	110B.	That might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians. The death of Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid -- yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered your Temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious. Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote -- at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power. Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
M	HOLMES	You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.
M	BLACKWOOD	Cut me loose, Holmes!
M	HOLMES	You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly. HOLMES First, the world will see you for what you are. Then you will hang... properly this time.
M	BLACKWOOD	We'll see about that shall we. It's a long journey from here to the rope.
M	HOLMES	We'll see about that shall we.
M	HOLMES	Oh, Irene... Her eyes pop open.
F	IRENE	It looks like rain.
M	HOLMES	We've still got a moment.
F	IRENE	You were right, he is a professor. Moriarty. Key's in the watch pocket. Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,
F	IRENE	You'll miss me, Sherlock.
M	HOLMES	Sadly, yes.
M	LESTRADE	It'll be a hell of a trick if Blackwood comes back from this one.
M	HOLMES	Thank you, Lestrade.
M	LESTRADE	Now you're going to be even more arrogant and insufferable than ever.
M	LESTRADE	You're welcome, detective. Is the woman up there?
M	HOLMES	She won't be by the time your boys get there. CONTINUED: 122A A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of
M	WATSON	One moment.
M	WATSON	Please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room.
F	MARY	What's in all those notebooks?
M	WATSON	Nothing really... Just a few scribbles... cases we've worked on over the years.
F	MARY	All your adventures... I'd love to read them sometime. As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear WATSON I still can't believe he's given us that ring.
F	MARY	Do you think he's finally come to terms with you leaving?
M	WATSON	Of course. No question about it -- WATSON Don't panic, dear.
M	WATSON	Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself.
M	HOLMES	Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
M	WATSON	Get on with it, Holmes.
M	HOLMES	Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook -- I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come down.
F	MARY	Shouldn't you help him, John?
M	WATSON	I hate to stop when he's on a roll. Do carry on, Holmes.
M	HOLMES	The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level?
M	WATSON	How did you manage it, Holmes? HOLMES I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all.
M	WATSON	Worse things could happen.
F	MARY	John.
M	WATSON	But none of this explains the lack of a pulse.
M	HOLMES	There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own. It is known locally as --
F	MARY	What's wrong with Gladstone?
M	HOLMES	-- mad honey disease.
M	HOLMES	He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind.
M	WATSON	His heart should be ticking in no time. Watson feels for a pulse in his dog's neck -- he shakes
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	Mr. Holmes... Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, right away.
M	HOLMES	What is it this time, Clarky?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	It's one of our sergeants, sir. He went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood... Well, a maintenance man found his body this morning. We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene. Shot in the head.
M	HOLMES	Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	Yes.
M	WATSON	Point blank range.
M	HOLMES	With small caliber bullet.
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	Indeed.
M	HOLMES	Moriarty.
F	MARY	There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right.
M	WATSON	Where is Blackwood's device now? CONSTABLE CLARK The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case.
M	HOLMES	I'd wager there's a piece missing.
M	WATSON	So you're saying Moriarty was after a part of the machine and not the poison.
M	HOLMES	The wire-free invention was the game all along. Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio waves.
M	WATSON	Adler was just a diversion.
M	DRIVER	I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
M	WATSON	Well...
M	HOLMES	I'll leave with you. Clarky, case reopened. OMITTED
M	CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)	We believe Sergeant Smith was the first officer there.
M	SERGEANT	Oi, what you doing?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)	Shot in the head.
M	HOLMES	Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	He was shot at point-blank range.
M	WATSON	There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right.
M	HOLMES	Where is Blackwood's device now?
M	CONSTABLE CLARK	The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case.
M	WATSON	I'd wager there's a piece missing.
M	HOLMES	Wager, Watson... I thought those days were behind you. Excellent deduction, however. removes a small receiver-like object from Blackwood's WATSON Moriarty was after the machine not the poison.
M	HOLMES	Blackwood's wire-free invention was the game all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two... Irene was just a diversion.
M	MAN	I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
M	WATSON	Well...
M	HOLMES	I'll walk out with you...
M	HOLMES	An honor working with you, Doctor.
M	WATSON	Take care of yourself, Holmes.
F	MARY	Try not to be too late for dinner with my parents and... be careful.
M	HOLMES	Magnificent woman, Watson. Magnificent!
