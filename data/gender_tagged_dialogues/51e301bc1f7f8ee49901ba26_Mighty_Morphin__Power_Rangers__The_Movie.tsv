M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	REVISIONS BY ARNE OLSEN	DIRECTED BY BRYAN SPICER REVISED DRAFT OCTOBER 31 1994
M	VOICE	In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil. with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force. In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords". while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title... The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
M	ROCKY	YeeeoowwWWWWW!!!
M	ROCKY	We're OUTTA here!!
F	KIMBERLY	Easy, Rock.
M	TOMMY	Once we hit the target zone we've got fifteen seconds to make the drop.
M	BULK (0 . S .)	Step aside, pinheads.
M	BULK	The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
M	SKULL	Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
F	AISHA	Lead on, flyboys.
M	SKULL	Bulk... where'd the earth go?
M	BILLY	Five seconds to the target zone!
M	TOMMY	Aisha you' re on !
M	ROCKY	Stylin!
M	ADAM	On your tail!
M	BILLY	All systems

F	KIMBERLY	Catch you on the flipside.
M	BULK	Be the eagle. Be the eagle.
M	SKULL	Be the swallow. Be the swallow...
M	BULK AND SKULL	Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!
M	BULK AND SKULL	YEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!
M	TOMMY	Let's BREAK!!
M	MR. KELMAN	Okay, so the firemen landed four out of six inside the target --
M	BOWLER	How `bout a show tune?!
M	MR. KELMAN	Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers in line.
M	FRED	Hey dad, get with the program!
M	MR. KELMAN	Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel Grove High
M	MR. KELMAN	And that's one! A perfect landing!
M	MR. KELMAN	Three for three. Look at `em go!
M	MR. KELMAN	That's five perfect landings! Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver.
M	TOMMY	Touch down.
M	FRED	Looking good up there.
M	TOMMY	Thanks, man.
M	MR. KELMAN	Congratulations - the Observatory's got a new lease on life.
M	FRED	Awesome! Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
F	AISHA	Who's up for lunch?
M	ROCKY	You read my mind.
F	KIMBERLY	Last one to Ernies buys.
M	ADAM	Let's roll!
M	SKULL	Stealth Eagle, huh? The Lame Duck is more like it!
M	TOMMY	Let's take the shortcut!
M	CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2	Whadda you figure it is?!
M	CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1	Hey, ya got me.
M	CONSTRUCTION WORKER # 1	... I'll be damned.
M	CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1	AHHHHHHHHH!
M	REPORTER	We're here at the World Center Construction Site, where a mysterious object was just uncovered in a freak accident in which one workman suffered minor injuries...
M	REPORTER	... Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat. The injured workman was quoted as saying...
M	TOMMY	It's one smooth move and then you've gotta explode off the top.
M	TOMMY	Nice and easy.
M	ERNIE	Hey, no Karate on the patio!
M	FRED	Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan Doe.
M	ERNIE	Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place else.
M	ERNIE	So, what're the plans for the weekend?
F	KIMBERLY	Aisha and.I are checking out a new dance spot.
F	AISHA	I heard that!
M	BILLY	I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
M	ERNIE	That's right - Ryan's Comet.
M	ROCKY	We should throw a little comet shindig.
M	ADAM	Any excuse for a party.
F	AISHA	The Eagle has landed.
M	BULK	The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
M	SKULL	We could smell it's breath.
M	ROCKY	There's a spot over there.
M	TOMMY (into communicator)	What's up, Alpha? Rangers, we need you at the Command Center, L.R.N. !
F	KIMBERLY	'Like Right Now.'
M	TOMMY	We're on our way.
M	TOMMY	What's happening?
F	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi ! Our thermionic-sensors have been hit by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!
M	ZORDON	Rangers, you must act swiftly. The planet is in GRAVE danger!
F	KIMBERLY	Danger from what?
M	ZORDON	Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. Finally, a rebel factor known as the "Order of the Meledon" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground.
F	ALPHA 5	In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
M	ZORDON	The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED! You must return it to the depths. or anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
F	ALPHA 5	To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
M	ZORDON	Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
F	RITA	Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS! My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel. Why didn't I listen to her?!
M	ZEDD	That's a good question.
M	FIRST SECURITY GUARD	Uh... Kurt... you might wanna take a look at this.
M	ZEDD	No need to wake him. In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself.
M	MORDANT	Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!
M	ZEDD	After two thousand years of searching... I have finally found you.
M	MORDANT	Yo, earth to Bigfoot!
M	GOLDAR	Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!
M	ZEDD	SILENCE! Where did you FIND this rabid little rodent, anyway?!
M	GOLDAR	Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side. He`s just visiting for the summer.
F	RITA	Well put a muzzle on him!
F	RITA	What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of SNOT!
M	ZEDD	Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
F	RITA	Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
M	MORDANT	Boss.
M	ZEDD	For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot !
F	RITA	You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?!
M	MORDANT	Boss.
M	ZEDD	WHAT!
M	IVAN	Ahhhhhhhh.
M	IVAN	Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE is back!!
F	RITA	He's so cute.
M	ZEDD	I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent. It is a supreme honor to finally meet you.
M	IVAN	How can I ever repay you?
M	ZEDD	Do you recall the name... Zordon of Eltare?
M	MORDANT	Seems to ring a bell.
M	ZEDD	I want you to destroy Zordon, so that my evil may once again reign SUPREME. I will not only destroy him, I will OBLITERATE his entire being. It will be like Zordon of Eltare never EXISTED!
F	RITA	Finally, a real man.
M	GOLDAR	Here's his address. "... left off Interstate 12?!" What's an "interstate"?
M	MORDANT	It's like a freeway. How long have you been locked up? !
M	ZEDD	We shall leave you to weave your wicked ways.
F	RITA	Now we go out on the town. First dinner, then dancing, then --
M	IVAN	What is that odious stench?
M	IVAN	Smell's like... TEENAGERS!
M	BILLY	Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his teleporting calculations.
F	AISHA	Anybody see anything?
M	TOMMY	... Let's take a look over there. It looks like it's been opened!
M	SECURITY GUARD (O.S.}	Hey!
M	SECURITY GUARD	You had me scared there.
F	AISHA	Makes two of us.
F	KIMBERLY	You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around?
M	SECURITY GUARD	The only thing I've seen is you teenagers. And you know... if there's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate.... It's TEENAGERS
F	KIMBERLY	GroSS!
M	IVAN	You're too kind. Allow me to introduce myself. I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, IVAN OOZE!
M	ROCKY	Well, pack your bags cause we're sending you back where you came from!
M	IVAN	Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years.
F	KIMBERLY	we're not just teenagers, raisin- head.
M	TOMMY	We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!
M	IVAN	Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?.
M	IVAN	Power Rangers, huh? So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work. And speaking of rats...
M	IVAN	From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO EXIST!
M	IVAN	WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE!
M	ROCKY	He's gone.
M	ADAM	Let's take these beasts!!
M	ZORDON	Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late! Ivan is on his way here! Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
F	ALPHA 5	Well... ALMOST nobody.
M	IVAN	Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy. I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice.
F	ALPHA 5	HI , YAH !
F	ALPHA 5	Welcome to Wiener World. May I take your order, please?
M	ZORDON	You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.
M	IVAN	Put a cork in it "Z" . Ten minutes out of the egg and I'm already listening to one of your lectures. the Supreme Ruler of the most foul Empire in the Universe. I was the King of Calamity. The Duke of Destruction. The big man on campus! And then you came along. You locked me into your stuffy little hyperlock-chamber and tossed me into the depths like yesterdays TRASH!
M	ZORDON	It worked for six thousand years.
M	IVAN	Don't remind me!
M	IVAN	Do you have any idea what it's like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years? It's BORING! Not to mention I've had a Charlie horse since the Renaissance! But now the tables are turned. Now... ... it's time to pay the PIPER!
M	IVAN	Oh, the things that I have missed. The BLACK PLAGUE!
M	IVAN	And now, finally, I have the strength to DESTROY your pathetic powers FOREVER!!
M	ZORDON	YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!
M	IVAN	I've got a NEWS flash for you LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!
F	ALPHA 5	You put your left probe in, you put your left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about. You do the hokey- pokey and you turn yourself around...
F	KIMBERLY	RAT breath!!
F	KIMBERLY	Somebody needs a shave.
M	TOMMY	IT'S MORPHIN TIME!
F	KIMBERLY	PTERODACTYL!
M	BILLY	TRICERATOPS!
M	ROCKY	TYRANNOSAURUS!
M	ADAM	MASTODON!
F	AISHA	SABER TOOTH TIGER!
M	TOMMY	WHITE TIGER!
M	RANGERS	MORPHENOMENAL!
M	TOMMY	Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
F	AISHA	Activating Power Beam!
F	KIMBERLY	Everybody stay alert. 21 ONWARDS
M	ADAM	Hold it... I heard something over there.
M	BILLY	Activating Audio Enhancer!
M	BILLY	They're on the other side of that wall.
M	TOMMY	Anybody see them?
M	ROCKY	Activating Power Scope!
M	ROCKY	THEY'RE ABOVE US!!
F	AISHA	Hey, handsome!
F	AISHA	My mistake.
M	TOMMY	SABA SABER? What a DREAM I was having!
M	TOMMY	We've got company.
M	SABA	Rats! I hate rats!
M	ADAM	Bad move, Willard!
M	ADAM	STEGA-STINGER!
M	ADAM	Coming through!
M	ADAM	Target Neutralized?
F	KIMBERLY	Raptor-Ribbon!
F	KIMBERLY	Now you see `em.
F	KIMBERLY	Now you don't.
M	BILLY	Not the brightest of beasts.
M	SABA	Na na na na na!
M	SABA	Fried mice, anyone?
F	KIMBERLY	What's going on?!
M	BILLY	Alpha, come in!
M	TOMMY	We'd better get back.
M	AISHA (worried)	Something's wrong!
M	TOMMY	Come on, guys... ... what happened here?...
M	ADAM	Guys!
M	BILLY	Alpha, are you okay?!
F	ALPHA 5	I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!!
M	BILLY	He must've blown an anitromic demodulator! Oh, no...
F	AISHA	... What's happening to him?'
M	BILLY	Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
F	KIMBERLY	We have to help him!
M	ZORDON	... Rangers... thank goodness you're safe.
M	TOMMY	We have to get you back inside your time warp.
M	ZORDON	I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons... all of it. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more.
F	KIMBERLY	Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to us all.-
M	ZORDON	... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once... and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through.
M	BILLY	what're we going to do?
F	ALPHA 5	I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am!
F	ALPHA 5	Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!
F	ALPHA 5	Thanks, Billy.
M	ADAM	There has to be something we can do.
M	TOMMY	Come on, guys, think!
F	AISHA	Alpha. Is there any way we can defeat this monster? Any way at all?
F	ALPHA 5	... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
M	ADAM	What?!
F	ALPHA 5	... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension.
M	TOMMY	How can we get to it?
F	ALPHA 5	As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain.
M	ROCKY	We have to try, Alpha. It's our only hope. It's far too dangerous. Zordon would never allow it.
F	AISHA	If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
M	ADAM	If Ivan Ooze isn't stopped, nobody will survive.
F	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi. The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
F	AISHA	How can we reach Phaedos?
F	ALPHA 5	Zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this!
F	ALPHA 5	This is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions. It should be enough to get -you there.
F	ALPHA 5	There is one problem. I only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos... I can't bring you back.
M	ADAM	So how do we get back?
F	ALPHA 5	... You'll have to pray that the legends are true.
F	ALPHA 5	You're sure you want to do this?! The Rangers share purposeful looks.
M	TOMMY	It's our only hope.
F	ALPHA	Safe journey, Rangers!
F	ALPHA 5	BE CAREFUL!!
F	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi. They're DOOMED!! How could he let them slip through his hands?! He's no better than the rest of the hired help around here!
M	GOLDAR	According to the TX Tracker, they're headed for Phaedos.
M	ZEDD	I'm gonna fire that slimeball so fast his not gonna know what hit him!
M	IVAN	Hi, honey, I'm home !
F	RITA	You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN! The Rangers are going after the Great Power I thought you said this guy was the Master of Disaster? He's nothing but a slime- infested, jelly-bellied blob of --
F	RITA	Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
M	ZEDD	How dare you?! Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
M	IVAN	Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. The "booger man" is taking over.
M	ZEDD	Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!
M	MORDANT	Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week!
M	IVAN	Ooooh, that tickles!
M	IVAN	My turn.
F	RITA	This is all your fault! If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened.
M	IVAN	Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs.
M	GOLDAR	We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
M	MORDANT	Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way. And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?! It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS! Not to mention...
M	GOLDAR (apologetic)	He's just visiting for the summer. Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one?
M	IVAN	Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!
M	MORDANT	Gasunteidt.
M	IVAN	SHUT YOUR BEAKS !!
M	IVAN	Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers... and TEAR THEM APART!
M	IVAN	Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
M	MORDANT	You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
M	MORDANT	IIIIIII!!!
M	ZEDD	Isn't this just TYPICAL! We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
F	RITA	From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! It just goes to show, ya never go into business with a booger.
M	MORDANT	Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!
M	TOMMY	Everybody okay?
F	KIMBERLY	Where' s BILLY? !
F	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi! The filamentary transistors have malfunctioned!
F	ALPHA 5	Why you low-frequency, battery operated --
M	BILLY	WHOAAAAAAHHHH!!! AISHA BILLY!!
F	KIMBERLY	You okay?
M	BILLY	I think so.
M	BILLY	This puddle thing is really getting on my nerves.
F	AISHA	Welcome to beautiful downtown Phaedos.
M	ROCKY	... Incredible...
M	TOMMY	Let's see if we can find this Master warrior.
M	IVAN	Taking over the world is one thing. It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
M	GOLDAR	You want me to place a few calls?
M	IVAN	No need. I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove.
M	GOLDAR	No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
M	IVAN	Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry. I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils! And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
M	GOLDAR	But boss, what about their parents?
M	IVAN	Ah, the old and doddering. I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
M	SKULL	I understand you're looking for a few new assistants.
M	BULK	Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best.
M	IVAN	What is this?! I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants!
M	SKULL	Hi, I'm brilliant. And I'm good looking.
M	IVAN	And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.
M	SKULL	Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
M	BULK	A stellar idea, Skull.
M	IVAN	Not so fast, greaseballs.
M	IVAN	You'll have to do.
M	TOMMY	Hey.
M	TOMMY	You okay?
F	KIMBERLY	I was just thinking about Zordon... everything we've been through together.
F	AISHA	You know, meeting Zordon... teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
M	ROCKY	It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us.
M	ADAM	... He's gonna make it, guys.
M	TOMMY	We'll get this warrior... save Zordon... and send that SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the SEWER he crawled out of.
M	ROCKY	TAKE COVER!
F	KIMBERLY	WE NEED OUR POWERS!!
M	MORDANT	WHAM! KAPOW! BOOM!
M	MORDANT	
M	TOMMY	HANG ON, KIMBERLY.
M	MORDANT	What's the matter with you woodpeckers! Take this guy out!
M	MORDANT	The Tengu Warriors my butt! The Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!
M	MORDANT	Hey, aren't you bird-brains forgetting something?!
M	MORDANT	Watch the meathooks!!
F	KIMBERLY	Wow! That was amazing for such a little dude!
M	FIGURE	You're trespassing. Now state your business.
M	TOMMY	We're looking for the Master Warrior. Do you know where we can find him?
M	FIGURE	The Master Warrior doesn't entertain visitors -
F	KIMBERLY	But we have to find him. Our leader Zordon is dying.
M	FIGURE	Zordon?
F	DULCEA	How did this happen?!
F	KIMBERLY	The lady asked you a question.
M	TOMMY	Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah...
F	KIMBERLY	He was attacked by this horrific being -- Ivan Ooze.
F	DULCEA	Ivan Ooze is free?! We are all in mortal danger!
F	DULCEA	Let' s go.
F	AISHA	Kind of bossy, isn't she?
M	IVAN	Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes. This ain't sludge and this ain't guck... this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze! Yesireebob. It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy. But best of all it's FREE!
M	BULK	Here you go! No pushing!
M	SKULL	There's enough for everybody!
M	FRED	So where'd this guy come from?
M	SKULL	Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
M	BULK	If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
M	SKULL	INCOMING!
M	WIZARD	Come on, come all -- it's an COZE FREE FOR ALL!
F	AISHA	Is this... food!
F	DULCEA	They're called squirbs.
F	KIMBERLY	Mine seems to be a little undercooked.
F	DULCEA	Add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference.
M	BILLY	... Not bad.
M	TOMMY	Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
F	DULCEA	What do you know of the Great Power?
F	KIMBERLY	Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze.
F	DULCEA	It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
M	BILLY	Where did it originate?
F	DULCEA	In another time, another dimension. It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
F	AISHA	So how can we get to it?
F	DULCEA	The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
M	TOMMY	And how do we do that?
F	DULCEA	By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti. It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
M	ROCKY	Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live. And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack. We don't have TIME for this.
F	DULCEA	You don't understand. If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy you. To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle. We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow.
M	SNOGGLE	GBUJIPHN HUPHLGMPNORU!!!
F	DULCEA	Snoggle, you watch your language!
M	SNOGGLE	Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
F	AISHA	Excuse me?
M	SNOGGLE	Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
F	DULCEA	He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
F	AISHA	Ah... sure.
F	AISHA	Ah... thanks.
M	BILLY	... Not bad.
F	DULCEA	In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal". Ninjetti - man and animal, together as one. Now, put your hands inside the flame.
F	AISHA	Yeah, right.
F	DULCEA	It will not harm you.
F	AISHA	Just kidding.
F	AISHA	Wow. Sand.
F	DULCEA	Now tell me... what do you see? I see... a bear
F	DULCEA	Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
F	AISHA	Stylin'!
M	ROCKY	I see... an Ape.
F	DULCEA	Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.
M	BILLY	I see... a fox
F	DULCEA	Close. Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
F	KIMBERLY	I think its some kind of bird.
F	DULCEA	Kimberly, you are the Crane, agile and sublime.
M	ADAM	That's gotta be a frog.
F	DULCEA	Adam, you are the Frog, quick as lightning.
M	TOMMY	It's... an eagle?
F	DULCEA	Look closer.
M	TOMMY	... A falcon?
F	DULCEA	Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
M	How do you know so much about the	Ninjetti?
F	DULCEA	I... am the sole living descendant of the "Nathadians". Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal.
M	FRED	Dad... ??!
M	FRED	DAD?!
M	KID #1	You seen my parents?
M	FRED	I can't find my dad either.
M	KID #2	What's going on?!
M	WILD KID	Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!
M	FRED	That guy was the student body President
F	DULCEA	The crane maintains it's agility through the perfect harmony of mind, body and spirit.
F	KIMBERLY	Awesome!
F	KIMBERLY	Let's see you do it . Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.
F	DULCEA	Snoggle, we don't have time for you to show off
F	DULCEA	The ape is strong, but more importantly it is flexible and free.
M	ROCKY	Who is this lady?
M	ROCKY	Here goes!
F	DULCEA	The wolf relies on it's enhanced senses to guide it... He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell.
F	DULCEA	The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye.
M	ADAM	Show off.
F	DULCEA	The bear is sturdy as a towering tree. Nothing can uproot it.
F	AISHA	Girl, you've got to be kidding me.
F	DULCEA	The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it. JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE!
M	TOMMY	You can do this. You can do this. You can do this...
M	ZORDON	... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
F	ALPHA 5	I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
M	ZORDON	... We must try to communicate with them.
F	ALPHA 5	Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink.
F	ALPHA	Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .
F	DULCEA	Each of you must reach deep within and draw upon your natural instincts... Only then will you know the way of the Ninjetti. Rest for a few hours. We will continue at daybreak.
F	KIMBERLY	So where are we supposed to sleep?
M	SNOGGLE	Buhph nghujr.
F	KIMBERLY	That guy's cruisin' for a bruisin'.
M	BILLY	I can hardly walk...
F	AISHA	I've never been this sore in my life.
M	BILLY	Do you guys really think we can pull this off?
M	ADAM	Maybe if we had more time.
M	TOMMY	... I wonder... We've been relying on our Morphin Powers for so long... maybe we've forgotten how to rely on ourselves.
M	TOMMY	We should get some rest.
M	IVAN	Ladies and gentlemen, Simon says... STOP!
M	IVAN	Simon says... stand on one foot!
M	IVAN	Simon says...
M	GOLDAR	Quack like a'duck!
M	GOLDAR	It just slipped out.
M	IVAN	SHUT UP!!
M	GOLDAR	You didn't say "Simon says". Simon says SHUT UP!!! Now, as soon as I give the word I want all of you to start digging. Do I make myself perfectly --
M	IVAN	This is the Iast time I use parents for anything!
M	IVAN	Let's pick it up here! I've got a schedule to keep. In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan!
M	GOLDAR	Hey, boss!
M	MORDANT	What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
M	IVAN	How did you fare?
M	MORDANT	Oh, it couldn't've gone better. The Power Rangers didn't know what hit them .
M	MORDANT	That's right. And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
M	IVAN	So they've been destroyed?
M	MORDANT	"Basically".
M	IVAN	What do you mean "basically"?
M	MORDANT	Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
M	MORDANT	Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. But you should've seen the size of his STICKS
M	IVAN	Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
M	MORDANT	How'd you know?
M	IVAN	Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
M	IVAN	How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED!
M	MORDANT	What're you talking about?! It wasn't my fault! You're the featherbrains that let them get away!
M	IVAN	I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold!
M	IVAN	And now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to victorious battle!
M	MORDANT	Where does he come up with this stuff?
M	IVAN	Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME DULCEA!
M	SNOGGLE	BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU!!!
M	TOMMY	How the heck?!...
M	ROCKY	What's going on?!
F	KIMBERLY	I don't believe it!
F	DULCEA	You have been visited by the animal spirits... they have given you their blessing.
M	CROWD	OOZE! OOZE! OOZE! OOZE!
M	IVAN	Thank you! Please! You're too kind. Finally. a little appreciation where it's deserved.
M	VOICE	We love you Ivan!
M	IVAN	Right back at ya!- Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?!
M	CROWD	NOT US!
M	IVAN	AND WHO MISSES RULES?!
M	CROWD	NOT US!
M	IVAN	AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN RAISING HELL ACROSS THE UNIVERSE?!
M	FRED	Can I have a word with you guys? What's really going on here?! Where are everybody's parents?
M	SKULL	Like we said before, that's classified, top secret...
M	FRED	Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them.
M	BULK	Well, why didn't you say so?!
M	SKULL	They're at the World Center Construction Site.
M	FRED	Uh. OOZE RULES!
M	BULK AND SKULL	OOZE RULES !
M	TOMMY	Dulcea... how do you and Zordon know each other?
F	DULCEA	We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the "Order of the Meledan". Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today.
M	ROCKY	So... what happened?
F	DULCEA	Over time our enemies were defeated... I returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere. Until you kids showed up, I hadn't heard from him for centuries.
F	DULCEA	He was always an inspiration...
F	DULCEA	This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith. That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti. If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow.
M	MORDANT	As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant. Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
M	GOLDAR	How about Major Moron?
M	IVAN	How about the two of you shut Up and pay attention!!
M	MORDANT	What is THAT!
M	IVAN	Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR! KEEP DIGGING. THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY. ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
M	FRED	Dad...?!
M	FRED	We have to get out of here! Dig... dig... dig...
M	FRED	Dad?!... It's me, Fred!
M	MR. KELMAN	Dig... dig... dig...
M	MORDANT (O.S.)	Gotchya!
M	MORDANT	Just shut your gap!
M	GOLDAR	Did I say anything?
F	ALPHA 5	frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
M	ZORDON	... I just pray we're not too late.
F	ALPHA 5	Let's give it a whirl.
M	REPORTER	Angel Grove Police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing gersons continues to grow
M	IVAN	Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.
F	ALPHA 5	Ai, yi, yi, yi, yi
M	IVAN	Are you bored with your work? Are you bored with your family Are you bored with your 1ife Well, come on down to Ooze City and LET'S GET STICKY!
F	DULCEA	The Monolith is there in the distance.
F	DULCEA	This is as far as I can take you.
F	KIMBERLY	You're leaving us?!
F	DULCEA	I have taught you all that I know. Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own.
F	DULCEA	It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
M	BILLY	What's a Triac?
F	DULCEA	About twenty seconds in your time.
M	TOMMY	And how do we release the power?
F	DULCEA	The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
M	ADAM	What does that mean!
F	DULCEA	That is a question that even I cannot answer. Remember, ten triacs. After that something bad will happen.
F	KIMBERLY	Like...how bad?
F	DULCEA	They say the power will throw off a super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone.
F	AISHA	That's pretty bad.
M	TOMMY	Thank you, Dulcea. For everything.
F	DULCEA	Ka'Alabas tor nartu En'Kata-Tay. May your animals watch over you.
M	IVAN	Finally, after centuries of waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon machines are ready to take on the world!
M	IVAN	GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE!
M	MORDANT	Oh, man, that was a rental!
M	IVAN	Mordant... let the ooze flow!
M	IVAN	Goldar... the roof!
M	IVAN	Looks like a fine day for raising HELL!
M	IVAN	HECALE MENNIPUS LIBRI MAGUS!
M	IVAN	Bullseye!
M	IVAN	LIFE!! Give my creatures LIFE!
M	MORDANT	This guy is the King!
M	IVAN	PARENTS OF ANGEL GROVE.
M	IVAN	YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE. NOW YOU WILL RETURN TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE AND LEAP TO YOUR DEMISE!
M	IVAN	What're you waiting for??...
M	IVAN	What!
M	GOLDAR	You forgot to say 'Simon says."
F	KIMBERLY	Man, these are the last guys I wanted to see.
F	AISHA	Whadda we do now?
M	BILLY	That's the only way to the Monolith...
M	ROCKY	We can take these guys!
M	ROCKY	LOOK OUT!
M	ADAM	The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out...

M	NEWS REPORTER	... the Mayor has declared a state of emergency and asked that the city be immediately evacuated. He has reiterated the need for everyone to remain calm.
M	NEWS REPORTER	Angel Grove has never before known such a crisis and we can now only pray for the swift arrival of the Power Rangers!
F	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi!
M	ZORDON	... Alpha, keep trying!
M	ROCKY	... The Nathadian Monolith...
F	KIMBERLY	I guess these guys weren't so lucky.
F	AISHA	We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
M	BILLY	There should be a way to open it.
M	BILLY	... Nothing.
M	ROCKY	Release the power with the power.
F	AISHA	Not that kind of power.

M	ROCKY	It can't end like this...
