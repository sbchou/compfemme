M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	BISHOP (V.O.)	Every man has a death that's right for him. Every one. REVERSE to find a wall of photographs, charts, official
M	BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	For every man, there's a way to leave this earth which is so right for them, it's almost as if they carry it with them. MOVING over the wall. MORE PHOTOGRAPHS. The Mark escorted
M	BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	When the right death overtakes a man, there will be grief in those who knew him, but there will also be a sense of inevitability. Because they will know, that of course... CLOSE ON BISHOP. Statue-like, except his eyes which dart
M	BISHOP (V.O.)	...Of course, this was always going to happen this way. WHOMP! The SOUND OF THE RACE floods in as the cars blow by, BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Two cars TANGLE in a corner, SPIN to a We STAY with Bishop as he SWIMS HARD, powerfully, not tiring. The Mark pushes the man back, ignoring him, hurrying on. At Behind the Mark, a locker door opens and closes. Like a The room is empty.
M	GROCER	'Evening, Arthur. Got your weekly right here. The man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter.
M	BISHOP	Hey, Sophie. I got something for you, wanna see? The girl smiles, puts down the book and comes over. Bishop The girl sees it, smiles... a little disappointed.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	I'm just kidding. Bishop reaches into his jacket, pulls out the next Sophie BEAMS, takes it. A quick hug and she's back to her
M	GROCER	What do you say, honey?
F	SOPHIE	Thank you, Bishop.
M	BISHOP	You're very welcome. And she's back into the book. Bishop smiles, a little sad.
M	GROCER	See you next week, Arthur. Bishop's Cobra drives past the MAIN HOUSE, a large craftsman, One photo in particular: The Mark, busy on the phone as a Bishop stares down at the picture, consumed by fire, Bishop jumps off the treadmill, immediately takes his pulse, ON HIS PLATE. His food is a meal we might expect an
M	MALE NEWS ANCHOR	...here's a guy at the top of his game. And yes there were questions about the money: Where did it all go. Were some of his friends less than friendly to the US? But in the end, it's not the feds who catch up with him --
M	FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR	It's that age old adage that boys will be boys. These dangerous hobbies come with the risk of accidents like this -- Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the door. It's open! Bishop pushes the door open, steps into... THE VIEW. Over all the city, thousands of lights twinkle.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	I'll just be a minute. We catch a GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair,
M	BISHOP	I'm sorry I was away so long this time. I had some complications... He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom. 30's. Long dark
M	WOMAN	You don't have to apologize. I'm just glad you're here now. Are you hungry? She starts to move by him, his hand catches her arm and she
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I just... miss you. I never thought I was going to be a "woman who waits." But I do. I wait for you. He nods. She breaks off, pours red wine in a glass.
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	Were you in Europe? Africa? Was there another woman?
M	BISHOP	No.
M	WOMAN	Liar. It's alright. I don't mind. I... I made something for you. She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV. Hits a
M	WOMAN ON CAMERA	Hey, you. Just got back from the weekend at the lake with Julianne and Barry and their kids. Their oldest is five. You'd like him. Everybody spoke about you, of course. We should go up there sometime, just the two of us... ON THE TV: She reaches towards the camera and the image
M	WOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D)	I, just got back from seeing the most boring opening at the Pierre Grochet gallery. And of course everyone's asking where you are and of course I made your apologies, but what I was thinking... ON THE TV: She winks at the camera, happily drunk. Raises Why weren't you here to take me home and make love to me...? She blows a kiss. Closes her eyes...
M	BISHOP	I'm not a man who... It wouldn't be good for you, if I was around all the time.
M	WOMAN	I know. I know. She moves to him and they are kissing fierce. Bishop grabs the woman who LAUGHS in ecstacy. He reverses
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Stay for breakfast? He turns. She's standing in the doorway, tying a robe around
M	BISHOP	Do I ever?
M	WOMAN	No. But there's a first time for everything. Bishop goes to the DVD player, slots out the DVD they watched
M	BISHOP	Thank you. This was a good one. See you next time.
M	WOMAN	Bishop... You all right? He turns, studies her. This is new ground. He nods and ... a BLACK BENTLEY sits parked in front of the house. A MAN
M	MAN	Yes, I just got here. No, not yet. He turns, REACTS as Bishop is there, CLOSE, barely sweating. Hold on, I got him. The man holds his cell phone out for Bishop. A beat, Bishop
M	MCKENNA (O.S.)	Arthur? Jesus Christ, Arthur, is that you?
M	BISHOP	...How are you, Harry?
M	MCKENNA (O.S.)	Oh you know, I'm God Damn perfect. I'm redecorating my fucking office and I wanted your advice on the god forsaken curtains is how I am. This is... this is something, Arthur. I need to see you, for old time's sake.
M	SECURITY	Sorry, gotta do this... Patient, Bishop puts his arms out as the man searches him. A tapping gets Bishop's attention. The corner office is Harry comes out from behind his desk, points Bishop to a big
M	BISHOP	I like the new digs. McKenna LAUGHS, like a grunt. Fiddles with his hearing aid,
M	MCKENNA	Has it really been that long? Jesus. You know how they say youth is lost on the young? They're right. If I had my nineteen year old body back, I wouldn't be here, I'll tell you that. I'd be out there, making it my personal life mission to bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit skirts.
M	BISHOP	Times have changed, Harry. They don't wear skirts anymore. McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head. He goes to the
M	MCKENNA	You know what all that is? That's their money, getting moved, exchanged. Made clean and neat and proper for Uncle Sam. And I have always been extremely careful. McKenna goes to his desk, tosses legal papers on the table
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	You know what that is? That's a God damn subpoena from the Justice Department. We get a new face in the white house, all of a sudden they want to look at my records. They got accountants want to go through MY BOOKS. Are you kidding me? I got the left hand coming after me for what I did for the right hand. Bishop looks over the papers, nods.
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	So I call them up. I say "hey, you guys gotta get your own house in order..."
M	BISHOP	And...
M	MCKENNA	And? And that's the point! Nothing. I tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it I get silence, zippo, fuck- all. What are they, twelve?
M	BISHOP	...I don't see how I can --
M	MCKENNA	That's bullshit, Arthur. Your father -- they still talk about the guy like he walked on water. You, they'll listen to. You --
M	BISHOP	I'm not a part of that. McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous.
M	MCKENNA	You remember that fishing trip we all took, back in the day. You were, what? About eight, right? You fell out of the boat... couldn't swim a stroke. City kid. You're in the water, splashing around.
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	You got these big eyes like saucers, like you're sure you're gonna drown. Splashing... swallowing water... just STARING at your father and he's not making a move. Remember? Just looking down at you like... Suddenly it's gotten less funny.
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	I finally had to grab you by the hair, pull you back into the boat. You're shivering like hell and he -- your dad -- gives one of those laughs. Those big laughs everyone loved him for. Anyway, the whole time you're in the water, you didn't cry out. Not once. You were a tough sonofabitch, even then.
M	BISHOP	That was a long time ago, Harry. McKenna turns from the window, takes in all his monitors,
M	MCKENNA	Well, I'm in the water this time, Arthur. You think it's easy for me to ask? It cuts like hell. But that's what I'm doing. Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the A long beat. Bishop... nods. The tension seems to DRAIN
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	...Thank you. Thank you. THROUGH THE GLASS WALL OF THE OFFICE. Bishop's eyes track as Even as Steve nods to one of his father's security and pushes
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	And here's the prodigal son, arrived to bilk me for ransom. Steve, this is Arthur Bishop. Steve shakes Bishop's hand. Strong. Observant.
M	STEVE	Hey. Nice to meet you. You work for my father?
M	MCKENNA	No, quite the opposite. Arthur's doing me a little favor.
M	STEVE	So you're a criminal?
M	MCKENNA	That's enough.
M	STEVE	Relax, relax. I'm kidding. A last beat between Steve and Bishop, then Steve lets it go, I need you to make a donation to Louise's charity. She's mounting some kind of fundraiser and she wants to make sure we do our part.
M	MCKENNA	What's it for?
M	STEVE	I have no idea. And don't pretend you care, either. Write the check, go to the party, smile when the
M	ORPHANS-SLASH-HOMELESS-WIDOWS THANK	you and call you a great and generous man. You ever think of having kids, Arthur?
M	BISHOP	Nope. Wearily, McKenna brings out his checkbook.
M	MCKENNA	Wise man. How much?
M	STEVE	Thirty thousand. You know, I can't tell what you're thinking, Mr. Bishop. Usually, I'm very good with that, with people. Sort of like a bullshit detector I developed. But you're very... hard to read.
M	BISHOP	Sorry.
M	STEVE	Don't be. So what are you thinking?
M	BISHOP	I was thinking that a son, should be more grateful to his father. I agree. I agree. I often wonder why I'm not. McKenna tears the check out, hands it to Steve.
M	MCKENNA	There. Now go away.
M	STEVE	Thank you, dad. Are we going to see you at the house any time soon?
M	MCKENNA	Yeah, this is just a few more days. We got this... situation. Steve hears the dark in his father's tone, tracks it.
M	STEVE	Anything I can do?
M	MCKENNA	You? Yeah, you can earn some money. Get married. No, it's going to be okay now. Arthur's helping me out. Steve glances between the two men. Ego slightly bruised.
M	STEVE	Well it's good to meet you Mr. Bishop. My father seems to trust you, which is... unusual. Bishop and McKenna watch as he hits the atrium, hands Louise
M	MCKENNA	We will take from our children for a lifetime what we would not suffer from another man for an instant. Explain that to me. Okay. Okay, call me when you hear something.
M	BISHOP	You take care of yourself, Harry.
M	MCKENNA	Well, that's your job now, isn't it?
M	ART DEALER	Arthur. Glad you're here. Right this way. As they move across the space Bishop catches sight of a This way. Bishop follows the Dealer into another area where they
M	ART DEALER (CONT'D)	Zak is almost finished. It will make a wonderful addition to your collection. Bishop looks at the canvas. Nods. Glances back to where the
M	ART DEALER (CONT'D)	Do you want to meet him?
M	BISHOP	...No.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can I help you?
M	BISHOP	Yes. I'd like to speak to Dean. There's a brief pause on the phone, then.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	...Mr. Dean is not available right now. Can I take a message?
M	BISHOP	No. Just tell him I called. Bishop hangs up, stares at the phone.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Hello, Don. They make you drive all the way out here this evening?
M	DON	That's the job. The man gestures to the open barn door, the classic cars.
M	DON (CONT'D)	You find tires for that old FleetMaster? No, not yet. Maybe when I do, we'll take it out for a spin. Say hello to the wife for me.
M	DON	Will do. Good night, Arthur. The man heads back towards his truck. Bishop tears away the Almost instantly, his phone rings and he answers. Silence. We should all be so lucky. Click. The phone goes dead. Almost at the same time, the
M	DEAN (O.S.)	Bishop. I heard you called. Hey, you get the stuff I sent you?
M	BISHOP	That's what I called about. I know him. I think there might be a
M	DEAN (O.S.)	Hold on a second. A long pause. Just air on the line. Bishop stares at his
M	DEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)	No, it's been decided. This one's a go. You take care of yourself, Bishop. The line goes dead. Bishop stares at the phone for a second,
M	MCKENNA'S VOICE	Hello?
M	BISHOP'S VOICE	They want to talk. I'm picking you up in an hour.
M	BISHOP'S VOICE	Send your people home. I don't want anyone I don't know near you today. I'm serious.
M	MCKENNA'S VOICE	...Thank you, Arthur.
M	BISHOP	I'm sorry. My bad. The guy at the counter shrugs, turns for a mop. Bishop Bishop picks up the torch, SPARKS IT.
M	SECURITY #2	Hey, you okay?
M	SECURITY #1	Actually, call central. I'm not -- And with that, he's suddenly up and MOVING towards the Except for Harry, alone, silhouetted at one of his large
M	MCKENNA	You ever wonder what the last day of your life will feel like, Arthur?
M	BISHOP	You keep standing next to that window, maybe you'll be able to tell me. McKenna looks over, smiles weary. He looks exhausted. He
M	MCKENNA	This turns out alright, I'm going to send you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos. You can return the hookers if you want, but the cigars... I don't smoke.
M	MCKENNA	You will, my friend. For these, you will.
M	BISHOP	Why the change of security?
M	MCKENNA	...What? Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button. Elevator jerks to a
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	Arthur...? McKenna looks at the effort, sighs. Lets Bishop help him
M	BISHOP	Come on...
M	BISHOP	What the hell...? McKenna moves in, pushes Bishop aside.
M	MCKENNA	This isn't good, Arthur...
M	BISHOP	Listen to me. Stay here. I'm going to check it out.
M	MCKENNA	Bishop, those men are armed...
M	BISHOP	Harry, relax. I know what I'm doing. And Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him.
M	BISHOP'S VOICE	Harry! It's a trap! RUN!!! The door flies opens and Bishop LURCHES IN, gun raised. Bishop comes rushing up the stairs. His shirt stained with
M	BISHOP	Come on! If we can get to the roof I can hold them off! Come on! McKenna GULPS AIR, staggers on... FEET come into his view. He looks up, sees Bishop standing
M	MCKENNA	...You. Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which turns into a scream as You bastard. You... Sonofabitch. You didn't have the balls... The balls to AARRRGHHHH! He CONVULSES. Tears stream down his face. His body HEAVING, ON BISHOP. We know it's in there. But it doesn't show.
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	Oh God. Oh, Jesus Christ help me.
M	ARRGHHHH!!! ARRRRGHHHHHH!!!!	Please... Please... Please... McKenna stops struggling, stares up at Bishop. Tears
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	Please, Arthur, put me out of my misery. Your father... Bishop checks his watch again, doesn't meet McKenna's eyes.
M	MCKENNA (CONT'D)	Please. I'm scared. I'm really god damn scared... Suddenly Bishop MOVES. Lightening fast, wrapping up Bishop releases, stands, stares down. For the first time, Bishop stands at the back. His eyes scan over the
M	PRIEST	His good works comfort all of us, even in his going. We commit his remains to your earth, oh Father, and we pray you vouchsafe him eternal life and that you bring comfort to those who have been left behind. His only son, Steve, who is himself devoted to -- The Priest falters as Steve rises, moves away from the event.
M	PRIEST (CONT'D)	...Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost... Bishop watches the dirt hit the coffin. Then looks over as
M	BISHOP	My condolences. Yeah, Harry was a popular guy. Good to see so many of his friends here. Touching. Bishop considers, tracks the attendees who pass by a suited
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Best grief money can buy. Give me a ride home? Bishop nods to the head limo where Louise is waving
M	BISHOP	Looks like you have one.
M	STEVE	Yeah, all of that. Empty limos. Fake guests. All so that the papers print what an important and respected man Harry was. Steve takes in the one or two guests, already counting their
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Well, I hope it's what Harry would have wanted. But it's not for me. Beat. Bishop nods.
M	STEVE	You know, what I don't get is you. Harry didn't have any friends.
M	BISHOP	Your dad worked with my father a long time ago.
M	STEVE	So?
M	BISHOP	So, just paying my respects.
M	STEVE	So your old man was into all that? Yeah, he was into all that.
M	STEVE	Well, that is refreshingly honest, Mr. Bishop. What about you? Bishop doesn't answer, steers the car up a manicured drive. Steve takes the whole thing in, nods, somehow pleased.
M	STEVE	Why is it so comforting, when people surpass even our lowest expectations? Come on in, meet the crowd.
M	BISHOP	No, thanks. I've got to --
M	STEVE	Please. A favor to me. None of these people even remembered what today was. Bishop nods. They move into the scene. People recognize
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Do you believe in fate, Mr. Bishop?
M	BISHOP	Why? A basketball hoop has been set up near the pool. Young men
M	STEVE	I think maybe we're all doomed to become our fathers. I'll probably die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and alone. Runs in the blood. What would that make you?
M	BISHOP	You're still young. You can do pretty much whatever you please. AT THE HOT TUB, two girls kiss each other, filmed in DV by an
M	STEVE	You think so? Just chuck all this and go help the children in South America, something like that?
M	BISHOP	Maybe.
M	STEVE	Well look at you, Mr. Bishop. You're a dreamer. Steve heads inside. A beat, Bishop follows. Well? Do you want to...?
M	STEVE	No, in fact I'm pretty sure that's illegal in this state. Come on, this way. Steve leaves the Beauties disappointed, moves up some stairs. Two bump fists with Steve. One fronts cool at Bishop, fakes On the floor, paintings of Harry McKenna, discarded.
M	STEVE	You know, I went up there. To where my father died.
M	BISHOP	Oh?
M	STEVE	Hell of a place to die. Lonely... Bishop comes abreast of Steve, also looks down. Removed from
M	BISHOP	That all yours?
M	STEVE	If the body is weak, the mind can't be strong. Bishop nods, impressed. Something about this young man.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	Steve! Steve, man. It's Louise. At the door, a FRIEND of Steve's is held back by security.
M	FRIEND	She's up in the bungalow. I think she might really do it this time. My girlfriend thinks that my father's death is a good time to kill herself. She thinks I'm not showing the appropriate human reaction.
M	BISHOP	I'll let myself out.
M	STEVE	No, please. You've seen this much. Aren't you interested? I am. Off Bishop...
F	LOUISE	Who's he?
M	STEVE	A friend. Would have thought you'd have started by now.
F	LOUISE	This isn't about me. It's about you. You need to watch. Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her whiskey
M	STEVE	Okay. I'm here. I'm watching.
F	LOUISE	You don't believe I'll do it.
M	STEVE	No, I know you, Louise. You'll do just about anything if it'll get you enough attention.
F	LOUISE	You think you can hide behind that cool attitude. Like nothing matters to you. But I know you. You care. You feel.
M	STEVE	Do I? Louise blinks, scared a little. But she pushes the fear Blood runs... stains the water rose.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	...Wow.
F	LOUISE	How long will it take? Mr. Bishop? Bishop rises, looks down at her in the tub.
M	BISHOP	How much do you weigh?
F	LOUISE	A hundred and ten. His eyes take in her body, the flow from her wrists...
M	BISHOP	You're a hundred and twenty-five. It'll take an hour and a half, maybe two. When you get cold... then you'll know you're close. Steve takes in Bishop in this moment, nods. Glances at the
F	LOUISE	He'll stop it. He thinks he's above it all. But he's not. No one is. Bishop nods. Not clear if he's agreeing or observing. Steve! Steve! I know you feel this. I know you'll stop me. If you don't care anything about your life, why should I? Steve looks to Bishop. He checks his watch. 10:30.
F	LOUISE	I'm getting cold. Please. I'm frightened. I'm scared, Steve. Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards.
M	STEVE	You can help her if you want. The sounds of water, splashing. Louise arrives on the patio,
F	LOUISE	You're a bastard.
M	STEVE	You know what the kick of it is, Louise? If you actually had the stones, then there's be something for us. But in 30 seconds when you run down that path and all of those people go crazy saving your life... Well, then we'll be done. I know. Catch-22. Life's not fair. What happened to you?
M	STEVE	Maybe nothing. Maybe you never really knew me. A beat. Louise, looking between the two men. She SWAYS on
F	LOUISE	You're a bastard, too. Both of you. Like looking in some dark mirror.
M	STEVE	Go on, Louise. You'll do fine. The world's gonna love you. Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into the
M	BISHOP	Would you have let her do it?
M	STEVE	We'll never know, will we? Steve rises, heads up a small path.
M	BISHOP	You didn't answer my question.
M	STEVE	Everybody dies.
M	BISHOP	Sure. But it's a whole other world when you're personally involved. There's a very big tab that has to be picked up.
M	STEVE	Such as? Bishop stops, looks down at the action far below them.
M	BISHOP	Governments, cops, the military... we give young men a licence and send them into it blind, thinking it'll all be okay. Because someone told them they had permission. But when you cross over that line, you do it alone. Most people, they stay that way from then on. Alone.
M	STEVE	Everybody can kill. You take a mother, protecting her child...
M	BISHOP	Sure. But that's instinct. What I'm talking about is up here... Knowledge of foresight. Intention. A person who knows that the only way to truly be free of man's laws, is to break his highest one. Beat. It sits there, between them.
M	STEVE	Why are you telling me all this?
M	BISHOP	Why did you want me to see that little stunt with your girlfriend? Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion. Ants swarming.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	These aren't your people, are they? You don't have "people." Your life is crowded, but you're alone. Steve unconsciously nods, then:
M	STEVE	You know, you're right. You grow up spoiled, rich, like me... Only thing you really learn to recognize in people is when someone wants something from you. What do you want, Mr. Bishop? What are you doing here? Bishop considers Steve, thrown. Then...
M	BISHOP	Thanks for the tour. It's been interesting.
M	STEVE	Yes, it has. Bishop turns, heads back down towards the estate. Steve
M	WOMAN ON TV	Hey, you. Jesus, what a night. We went to opening of Fernando's new restaurant and Betty was there wearing -- well, whatever we call those things she wears... ON THE STACK OF DVDs. There must be twenty of them.
M	WOMAN ON TV (CONT'D)	I miss you. Everybody says hi, of course. But with me... it's like I feel you there with me, even when you're not. ON THE TV: She pulls her shirt off over her head, faces the
M	WOMAN ON TV (CONT'D)	I feel the way you touch me... Bishop rises, blows out of the room. BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Laughter, smiles, hands touching, hands
M	FEMALE DOCTOR	Quite a collection you have here. Military?
M	BISHOP	Something like that.
M	FEMALE DOCTOR	Does this hurt? Bishop smiles, recognizing the nature of the touch.
M	BISHOP	Yes, a little. The doctor lets her hands rest just a fraction too long, then
M	FEMALE DOCTOR	Any next of kin, anybody we can notify? How about an acquaintance?
M	BISHOP	Am I going to die? No, not today. Bishop reaches for his shirt, slips it on.
M	FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	You damaged your deltoid muscle. But that doesn't explain the anxiety attack.
M	FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	Any unusual stress recently? Something at work? I'm prescribing Cataflam for the pain and Paxil for the stress and I'm going to give you my card. If you have any other episodes... or if you need anything else, don't hesitate to give me a call. She holds out her card. He looks at her, lets her stay that
M	FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)	You can pay at the desk. The Doc demonstrates the precise hold, the pressure points BANG! BANG! BANG! POUNDING on his front door. Bishop's
M	STEVE	Mr. Bishop! Arthur! Please, I need to speak with you. The front door opens. Bishop, fronting sleepy. Steve is
M	BISHOP	What time is it?
M	STEVE	I wanna show you something. Please. It'll be... It'll be interesting.
M	BISHOP	Gonna tell me what the big surprise is?
M	STEVE	I'd rather show you. I know, melodramatic. But I think it'll be worth it to you. Bishop TENSES, almost imperceptible as Steve pilots the car Steve opens his case, starts tossing down PHOTOGRAPHS: Maybe it's time you start talking.
M	STEVE	You know what that says? My dad didn't die of a heart attack. I mean, he was dying of a heart attack, but that's not what killed him. The blood flow to his brain was cut off, his brain died before his body. Somebody killed him. On Bishop, considering Steve.
M	BISHOP	What do the police think? The police? They don't want to hear about this. I mean, they'll look into it. But they don't very much like the idea that they totally missed this one and it'd be just easier for everyone if I would shut the hell up.
M	BISHOP	...What do you want?
M	STEVE	They killed him. Here, on the roof of his own building. His own security all around. Why here? Why even kill him, if he was already dying?
M	BISHOP	You tell me.
M	STEVE	To make a point. That no one's safe. That they can get to anyone, whenever they want to.
M	BISHOP	So what am I doing here? Bishop, supremely alert, listening. Tracking shadows...
M	STEVE	I got my black belt in Karate when I was nineteen. I've studied Judo since I was six.
M	BISHOP	I'm impressed.
M	STEVE	No, you're not. Most people are, but you're not. If I came at you right now, I'd wind up dead as my father, wouldn't I? Bishop doesn't answer. Steve breaks away, looks down at the
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Same as if I tried to exact justice for my father. These men, what this is... It's something you know about, isn't it? Something you could teach me.
M	BISHOP	I didn't get the impression you even liked Harry very much. Steve SURGES forward. Real anger, intensity boiling over.
M	STEVE	You really going to stand there and judge how much I loved my father? What the hell do you know about it? Bishop, hearing this. A nerve touched.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Besides, this isn't just about Harry. Harry's dead, may he rest in peace. But this is about me. They came here and they killed my father. They did that to me.
M	BISHOP	You want revenge. Steve doesn't answer. A long moment between them. Steve
M	STEVE	You know the word "Nemesis"? It's not actually a word. It's a name. She was one of the Greek goddesses. Of anger. Retribution against any mortal who became too proud. The executor of divine justice. It's a beautiful idea, don't you think? Justice.
M	BISHOP	Justice? A beat. Bishop shakes his head, turns, starts to walk back Fine. Fine. In case you haven't noticed, I now have a couple of million dollars to spend on this, so I will find them myself and I'll deal with them myself and if I wind up dead trying, you can bury me right next to dear old dad --
M	BISHOP	Jesus, stop your whining. SLAP! No one's ever spoken to Steve that way. He STARES. A
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Corner of sixth and Grand. Tomorrow morning. 7:00 am. Don't be late.
M	STEVE	I won't. Beat. Bishop nods, starts to leave, turns back...
M	BISHOP	And Steve... no more surprises like this, okay? Steve nods. Bishop goes. On Steve, watching as the elevator
M	BISHOP	Stay focused. This is a test. Bishop moves down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	You want to know about killing, look around. Steve does, a little creeped out, but keeping it cool.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	The act of killing, is an end in itself. Any other motive keeps it from being pure.
M	STEVE	The psychopath has no motive.
M	BISHOP	No, he's driven, compelled, by his sickness. He's as much the victim as those he kills. More drapes fall. Dead eyes stare up at them.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	But when you make your own law, you're responsible to no one else but yourself. Maybe you're free...
M	STEVE	I understand.
M	BISHOP	Do you? This isn't some idea anymore. This is the real thing. You still with me?
M	STEVE	I am. Another drape falls. A beautiful woman. No signs of injury.
M	BISHOP	Ever heard the term "Mechanic" used outside of its normal meaning?
M	STEVE	My father used it. A dealer... a guy who works the tables. Bishops smiles, shakes his head.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Or a... killer. A hit man. Bishop just stares. Steve shakes his head, looks away from
M	BISHOP	What are you thinking?
M	STEVE	I had you pegged as... a security consultant. Maybe ex-military. Someone who... protects people.
M	BISHOP	Maybe I do.
M	STEVE	Or maybe you just get paid to kill people. Bishop nods his head yes.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	So why let me in? I mean, I know what I want. What do you get out of it?
M	BISHOP	...Times are changing. Security is better trained, more lethal. Sometimes I could use a partner.
M	STEVE	Bullshit. Bishop nods, smiles. He moves away from the tables, leaves
M	BISHOP	In this... there isn't room for those who are outside of it. There's too much isolation. Friendships can't work. Eventually everyone expects you to account. The isolation... becomes a liability. You stand out. Standing out... isn't good. Steve smiles, shakes his head.
M	STEVE	You need a... friend?
M	BISHOP	An associate. I'm offering to teach you something that most people can't be taught.
M	STEVE	Because you think I'm a natural.
M	BISHOP	That remains to be seen. But you're alone in there, aren't you? That's... the prerequisite. Steve continues to stare at the bodies. Bishops starts
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Think it over.
M	STEVE	Bishop... When I find the men who murdered my father. You help me to kill them.
M	BISHOP	You may never find them.
M	STEVE	You didn't answer my question. A beat. Bishop nods.
M	STEVE	I'm still at 130.
M	BISHOP	Too fast.
M	STEVE	I know. I'm working on it. Bishop nods, picks up the rifle, sights. BLAM! 1,000 yards
M	BISHOP	You were still over 100.
M	STEVE	What am I supposed to do?
M	BISHOP	There are no perfect situations. You fought me at 100%, so you were winning. But in doing so, you gave up your shooting option. It's all about choices. Always. Bishop starts to leave.
M	STEVE	Bishop... What's your 100% look like? Bishop smiles. ... who has to PEEL away, off the highway, onto the smooth LOOMING AHEAD: An existing accident. A beer truck jack- Steve SWERVES his car, too fast, it goes into a SPIN... CLIPS BISHOP'S CAR slides to a stop. Bishop gets out, tracks:
M	STEVE	Come on up, man. The view is beautiful. Bishop takes in the situation, the small crowd gathering...
M	BISHOP	You lost control.
M	STEVE	You think? Steve puts out his beer. A hesitation, then Bishop clinks
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	You ever think about just... going? Leaving. Never turning back?
M	BISHOP	...Sometimes.
M	STEVE	Why don't you?
M	BISHOP	I have... responsibilities. I have a cat. A beat. Steve LAUGHS loud. Bishop laughs. Maybe the first
M	STEVE	You know, looking at these, a person might think maybe there's a screw or two loose up there... Steve catches sight of a manila envelope in front of his Is this what I think it is? Don't be so eager. Open it. PLANS, diagrams. Pictures. They're of an outdoor area.
M	STEVE	Who's the Mark?
M	BISHOP	...I am.
M	BISHOP (V.O.)	It's not good enough to simply follow your Mark and attack him. Most of these people know they're targets. They'll be watching for you. ... A moment, then Steve enters the frame, tracking Bishop. You need to understand the location, control the situation. You're looking for escapes, security, police presence... Bishop passes two COPS, squeezes between two parked produce
M	OWNER	Interest you in anything? Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective
M	BISHOP	That's a beauty. You know your instruments...
M	BISHOP (V.O.)	Most of all, you need to answer this question: "How does this man die here today?" Bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat. Steve
M	BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Everybody, everyday, has a way to die. You have to find it.
M	SALESMAN	They don't make that anymore. That's a classic. I can let you have it for three hundred... CRASH! The one truck SLAMS into the second, the vice closed, Bishop, at the last minute pulled back by Steve who's holding
M	BISHOP	...Good. Very good.
M	STEVE	Good? That's all you got? How about God damn perfect, man?
M	BISHOP	Don't get cocky.
M	STEVE	Broad daylight. A thousand witnesses. Man takes a wrong step. Excuse me if I take a moment to appreciate myself. Because that was poetry. You just can't bring yourself to be impressed, can you? Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	What's that? You're what? Oh, you are impressed? No, come on, you don't have to say that. Really, I'm fine with -- You what? You've never seen someone better? Wow.
M	BISHOP	All right. You did very well.
M	STEVE	Damn straight I did. And now, in celebration of me, I'm taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses... what? Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	...Bishop?
M	BISHOP	There's a man behind me. Look up once, then look away. Don't look back. Steve glances up. We realize we're right in front of the You got him?
M	STEVE	Yeah. Look...
M	BISHOP	You did good here. Really good. But this was just a game. That man... is your graduation.
M	STEVE	Who is he?
M	BISHOP	He owns the watch store.
M	STEVE	I know. I meant... what did he do? Bishop comes close, FOCUSED.
M	BISHOP	I've taught you how to kill without anyone knowing there was a murder. I've taught you to be invisible. But that's strategy, not killing. The real test... it's the actual killing, isn't it?
M	STEVE	Bishop...
M	BISHOP	Do you want this? Be very sure. Because you can walk away.
M	STEVE	No. I'm ready. Bishop studies him... nods. Turns to go.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Bishop... We're right here, where you wanted us to wind up. You knew where I'd hit you, didn't you?
M	BISHOP	...School's out. Bishop leaves. Steve watches him go. Stuck. Helpless. He
M	BISHOP	Who do you think that is, Luna? He takes a card out of his wallet, studies it. It's from the He returns to his desk, sits. A tiny noise from the hall. A
M	TRACKING ACROSS THE ROOM	To the front HALLWAY. Steve stands in the hallway, It's open!
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	I'll just be a minute. A GLIMPSE of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a
M	BISHOP	It's for a friend. Bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door,
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	I'm sorry I was away so long this time. I had some complications --
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Don't be. He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the
M	WOMAN	You know who I saw yesterday? Bradley Fliescher. He and Ginny have this little cottage up the coast they hardly use. I was thinking, maybe next week you and I should go. Approaching, handing him a wine.
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	You and me, the whole weekend. What would we... do? She approaches him, sexy. Touches him, intimate. He stares
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	Of course why do we need that? We have each other right here.
M	IN THE LIVING ROOM	The owner pauses, enjoying the crescendo of the music. Eyes ... Steve is standing in the doorway to the living room, the The Owner leaps at him with the rack. Steve is BARELY able ... Blood pools on Steve's shirt. Steve and the Owner both Do you know what I dreamed? I dreamed you and I had a child... Bishops turns from the screen, walks away. Beat, she
M	WOMAN	I know, it's crazy. I don't want to pin you down. I know you need your freedom. I just... sometimes I miss you so much... He's staring at her, oddly.
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	What? A beat. His eyes move down to her sofa where another man's
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. Really, I am. I just... You didn't give me any warning this time. I'm sorry, Bishop. It won't happen again. It's okay. Really. It's okay. Steve comes out of nowhere, HITS the man in the head with a Steve rises... and the Man is on him, kicking him. Steve, Steve SCREAMS, surges up with the man... smashing him THROUGH The two men... eye to eye. Fierce, deadly. Steve SQUEEZING ...Finally, the man weakening. In his face... a dull Who... are... you? Steve doesn't answer, just keeps PRESSING. And finally...
M	WOMAN	Hey, Bishop. You okay? He stares into his wine. Raises the glass to drink. His
M	BISHOP	Do you remember, what you wanted to be, when you were a little girl? She hears it, it wounds her. Looks down. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I was thinking of me. She looks up, clear eyes. She's tough.
M	WOMAN	No, it's okay. I wanted to be a Marine Biologist. I used to watch those Jaques Cousteau movies and just... dream.
M	BISHOP	What happened? I was beautiful. He hears the simple truth of it, nods, respectful. He rises
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	Don't worry about it this time. On the house. A beat. Then he slides the money under the box as before.
M	BISHOP	We all gotta make a living. He leaves, grabbing the doll as he goes. She watches him go,
F	SOPHIE	Thank you, thank you! Bishop! Mom!
M	MOM!	She takes off back into the living quarters of the house.
M	BISHOP	I saw that in a... I'm sorry, I probably should have asked. A small beat that says "Yes, you should have."
M	GROCER	Don't worry about it, Bishop. You have a good night.
M	STEVE (O.S.)	...Can I ask you a question? STEVE sits on his sofa in the dark, head lowered.
M	BISHOP	Go ahead.
M	STEVE	Are you surprised to see me? Beat. Steve reaches over, turns on a table lamp as he looks
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Guy owns a watch-store, yet keeps a million dollar apartment. Supposedly sits on his ass all day, yet takes stairs double-time. It was sitting there, right in front of my face, wasn't it? Bishop doesn't respond.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Was that the man who killed my father?
M	BISHOP	There's a code, to what we do. It may not be rational, but it matters. The man's name was Harry Xiao. He was a Mechanic. Last year a US Representative died in a fire... along with his wife and two children.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	A few months ago, a CEO vacationing in Costa Rica was found dead with his wife. Because the woman was tortured, the authorities believed it was drug related.
M	STEVE	Bishop! --
M	BISHOP	Civilian casualties are very effective at hiding intent, but there's a line ---
M	STEVE	I don't give a damn about that! You haven't answer my question: Did he kill my father? Bishop doesn't react, then...
M	BISHOP	You should put that behind you now. Steve nods, swallowing emotion. Bishop starts to move and
M	STEVE	I could have died today!
M	BISHOP	You didn't.
M	STEVE	Blind fucking luck! Look at me! You tried to kill me! That man was... he was unstoppable.
M	BISHOP	But you stopped him.
M	STEVE	Fuck you! You sonofabitch! Give me one good reason I don't blow you away right now! ONE GOD DAMN FAST, Bishop SLAPS the gun away, PINS Steve up against the
M	BISHOP	Now I'm sorry if you got a little scared. But this isn't coaching girl's softball, is it? This is life or death. Every time you go into this, somebody dies. Every time, it's you or the other man. So stop your crying. He releases Steve who falls to the floor, sucking air.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	You got what you came for, congratulations. You're done Go back to your friends, your women, your whole beautiful life. That used to be my front door. Try to close it on the way out. Bishop starts to go. Steve's words stop him.
M	STEVE	Bishop. Those things... they don't mean anything to me. This, makes sense. I don't know why. But I think I was meant to do this. And like you said, you could use someone. Bishop studies Steve a long beat. Shakes his head, goes into Almost instantly, the phone rings. Bishop punches on
M	BISHOP	We should all be so lucky. The phone goes dead. The light on the drive turns GREEN. A second to realize: She's the mark. More pictures, we've
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	You get started. I'll make coffee.
M	STEVE	Bishop... Nemesis. Devine Retribution. ...What did she do? Beat. Unsaid questions asked, unanswered.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Okay. Okay. Forget I asked.
M	BISHOP (O.S.)	Slow down as soon as you get inside. Security station will be to your left... Steve passes through a door, pauses as two guards talk in the
M	BISHOP (O.S.) (CONT'D)	How many views?
M	STEVE	Sixteen, no, eighteen. Four second intervals. One of the men notices Steve who starts forward to ask a
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Make that four and a half seconds.
M	STEVE (O.S.)	These guys are packing Israeli-made Uzis. Couple are actual military. Bishop takes in the other buildings across the street, then
M	TURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE	No, we're literally locked in here. I'm supposed to be presenting at the UN but I can't do that if everyone is going to panic about security...
M	TURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE	...This is America. People don't just kill people here. Then she shuts the door. Bishop moves his focus upwards to a Magazine and newspaper clippings about the Mark, showcasing Headlines: "The new (and beautiful) face of Turkey." "The
M	BISHOP	Work it again.
M	STEVE	She never leaves. It's like they know we're coming.
M	BISHOP	Maybe they do. Steve nods, continues pacing, scoops up Bishop's cat and
M	STEVE	Falls off the rooftop.
M	BISHOP	Falls or jumps? Steve moves to the wall of pictures, his gaze lingering on I tell you one thing, killing her is not the first thing that jumps to mind... what? Bishop HEARS this, frowns, moves forward. His eyes scan:
M	BISHOP	Nothing. I'm going for a run. You wanna come?
M	STEVE	Let me ask you something. You ever not feel like running 5 miles? You like it? Steve REACTS. Didn't hear Bishop come in.
M	STEVE	I don't know. Feels disturbed.
M	BISHOP	Always made me feel... understood. Come on.
M	BISHOP	The Mark is a beautiful woman. Before arriving at her current position, she enjoyed the way men looked at her. That's gone now. She needs to be taken seriously. She hates that men only see the beauty. Magazines, heads of state, all focusing how what a piece of tail she was. Like you did. Steve SQUINTS... Bishop slaps a picture of the pool, the
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Why is he standing here? Wouldn't he get better coverage... here?
M	STEVE	...He can't see her.
M	BISHOP	He can't see her. Neither of them can. Beat. PHONE RINGS. Bishop snaps it up. Bishop.
M	DEAN (O.S.)	Hey, Bishop. Catch you at a bad time? Bishop doesn't respond. Waits...
M	DEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Always the conversationalist. Anyway, just calling to say we'd like you to go ahead with this one. As soon as you can. Click. Phone goes dead. Bishop hangs it up. Steve looks at
M	BISHOP	Run it again.
M	STEVE	Patrol number three moves down the service corridor at 18:50. Five minute window after to make it up top. Three minute climb to position. That's 18:54. Three minute window to engage. Shake, stir, add lime and enjoy. Bishop smiles, looks away.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	How'd you get into it? Bishop looks back, surprised. Checks his watch.
M	BISHOP	...This business, it's not like there's a degree you can go get. It's like most trades, it gets passed down. My father was very good, better than I'll ever be. But no one controls 100%. The nature of the work is that some people know who you are and what you do. A man told his girlfriend, to impress her. The girlfriend told some people she owned money to... Bishop finishes his glass of water.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	I was young. It took me four months to find the people, another to find the girl, and she gave me the Man. That's how I... "got into it."
M	STEVE	You ever wish you just... walked away? Let it go?
M	BISHOP	Sure. Every day. But I wasn't wired that way. What about you? Beat. Steve and Bishop, oddly locked... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Here we go... And they're MOVING.
M	SECURITY	Fire in the restaurant. Patrols two and five, we're closing down the front entrance.
M	SECURITY PRO	Excuse me, 'mam. There's a fire next door, nothing to worry about. The Mark nods. The man locks the door behind him, crosses
M	STEVE	building is going up! Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave.
M	BISHOP	Ready? Steve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under Bishop lets himself fall backwards. Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy The Mark enters, and hangs up her robe. She goes to the edge ACROSS THE SPACE. The indoor guard checks in on his radio.
M	WITH THE MARK	She kicks hard, dives under... And we're in her P.O.V. The
M	ACROSS THE ROOF	The first guard reaches the source of the noise: A plastic
M	DOWN AT HER!!!!	She opens her mouth to scream... ABOVE THE SURFACE. It's silent. No sign of the violent UNDERWATER. The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her
M	GUARD #2 (TURKISH)	It's the second time it's come open. She still swimming?
M	GUARD #2 (TURKISH)	Oh hell... The Mark floats face-up in the pool, just under the surface.
M	STEVE	How did it go --
M	BISHOP	Not yet. As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES. Excited voices come on over
M	STEVE	Alright, you gotta admire that. You gotta admit, we are a spooky good team... They PUSH through a set of old doors, move fifteen feet to a It's like one moment we're there... the next moment... He ROLLS UP the door. STARES at a NEW WALL OF CEMENT BRICKS.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	...we're fucked. Bishop takes in the problem, starts to solve it. He tracks There wasn't any sign of this on the plans. I went over them fifty times!! This isn't supposed to be here! This can't be here! Bishop holds up a finger. "Shhhhhh" They LISTEN. A soft
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Bishop... what do we do!?
M	BISHOP	Duck... Steve looks at Bishop and BOOM! Doors BLOW OPEN, THREE Bishop WRAPS the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a Fluid, Bishop REVERSES the man, pushes him AWAY from him, Another down as ANOTHER ATTACKER dives through the door at Bishop SHOVES the last grenade down the front of the dead ... TWO more Security kick open a door, guns fire! Bishop
M	BISHOP	Hey! Hey! You still here?
M	STEVE	...It was my fault. I was in charge of the exit. I looked at every work order, every entry in the building logs...
M	BISHOP	No one controls 100% That's the nature of the beast. Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last
M	BISHOP	Hey! You did good in there. You hear me?. It was asking a lot. You came through. Steve nods, processing, accepting. Another TURN. Bishop Behind them, the police car tears by, lost.
M	STEVE	You're bleeding.
M	BISHOP	...Yup.
M	STEVE	So back there. That was one hundred percent? Bishop looks over, gives nothing. Tiny smile.
M	STEVE	Do you think you know it, when you've made the mistake you won't survive? Or will it be like the Marks? Wake up on top of the world, never know... Steve glances into the open cabinet where Bishop keeps his
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	...Oh my God. This is a signed Hendrix Axis, 1967 release. This has gotta be worth... we have to play this. You have to play this.
M	BISHOP	That one... is for a special moment. Haven't found it yet.
M	STEVE	You haven't found the... Are you kidding? You have to -- what? Bishop's eyes SHOOT open. He looks out the window where a
M	BISHOP	This could get... interesting.
M	MAN	Mr. Bishop? Mr. Dean would like a moment of your time. Off Bishop who... nods. WIDER. The SECURITY PROFESSIONAL is up here with Steve,
M	STEVE	Do it. I don't care what it costs. Driver pulls the sedan to a stop in front of a large A door opens and a plain woman nods to Bishop.
M	DEAN	You look like shit. How does Harry McKenna's son figure in?
M	BISHOP	He's going to be working with me from now on.
M	DEAN	You sure that's wise?
M	BISHOP	Do I need your permission?
M	DEAN	No... And for the record, I don't believe you'd ask for it. Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the set That was my baby. But my baby has turned into an epic shit-storm and so when the man who caused said epic shit storm suddenly decides to do some soul-searching... What are you doing, Bishop?
M	BISHOP	The mistake was mine, not the kid's. Dean leans in, intense. Bishop watches the screens. A
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	I am on some very fucking thin ice right now which means you are on some very fucking this ice as well.
M	BISHOP	Someone I trained. That could be worth a lot to you. Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the
M	DEAN	And here I thought we were both going to live forever. Bishop smiles. Dean stares at him. Bishop stares back.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	You know, in this business, you only get one mistake. So nothing more like that. You take full responsibility.
M	BISHOP	Yes. The two men, face to face. Then Dean's phone rings. He Hey, Stanley. Yes, we're all sorted out. I just need you to --
M	BISHOP	The hit, on the woman. What was the reason? Dean looks back, surprised, angered. I'm calling you back. Dean clicks off, takes in this change of rules. A dead
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	You know, this foul-up, McKenna's son, it's all got some people's panties in a real twirl. This isn't the time for questions. This is the time for survival. Everyone... is expendable. Beat. Dean turns away, picks up the phone again. Yeah, get me Stan again...
F	LOUISE	Come on, baby. What's the matter? Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a
M	BISHOP	Steve! Steve...!?
M	LATER	Bishop tense, in his study, holding the phone which rings...
M	LATER	Bishop, sitting on his couch. On the TV in front of him, His phone rings. He snatches it up.
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Bishop.
M	STEVE (O.S.)	You're still alive.
M	BISHOP	Seems that way.
M	STEVE (O.S.)	Hey, can you meet me? Something I want to talk with you about. Bishop, silent.
M	STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	It's important. Come up to the house. Please, okay?
M	BISHOP	Okay.
M	STEVE	There you are. Thanks for coming.
M	BISHOP	What's on your mind? Steve just smiles, shakes his head. Bishop stares at him, Bishop ducks, rolls, his hand moving under his jacket... Bishop rises. Women come to him, touch him, put a party hat
M	BISHOP	It's not my birthday.
M	STEVE	When was the last time you celebrated your real birthday? No response from Bishop. Steve nods, swigs the bottle again.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	See? You're overdue, buddy.
M	BISHOP	Who are these people?
M	STEVE	They think you're a friend of mine, a producer, from Canada. In other words, they're all your best friends. So what movies have you made? Oh, he makes the really violent, disturbing stuff. You wouldn't know it to look at him, I know, but what's locked up away in there... Frightening, man.
M	MODEL	God, I love those. Which ones --
M	BISHOP	Mr. KcKenna has a creative relationship with the truth. I don't actually... The model glances around, unsure...
M	MODEL	Oh, okay. That's funny. So what do you do?
M	STEVE	Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do? Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Come on, Mr. Bishop. We're all waiting. Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then
M	BISHOP	Excuse me... He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	Hi.
M	WOMAN	Hi... This is strange. The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High-
M	BISHOP	Is he your...?
M	WOMAN	No, just a job. I have to...
M	BISHOP	I know. Go on. She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through
M	STEVE	Ladies and gentlemen! The man of the hour! A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	I know that not many of you know my friend. My good, dear... friend. I mean, he's a man of few words... And he's an art lover! Did you know that? His home is covered with work. It's amazing, what you can find in there. Amazing. A weird beat. Steve, smiling fierce.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Happy birthday, Arthur. Behind Steve, a covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls
M	STEVE (O.S.)	Hey, you forgot something. Steve's there, holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it.
M	BISHOP	Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm just not used to --
M	STEVE	No worries, man. It's your party. You can leave it. It's true, isn't it? What you said to me the first time we met.
M	BISHOP	What's that?
M	STEVE	This thing we do. Finally, you always do it alone. Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces
M	BISHOP	Steve... thank you.
M	STEVE	Uh-oh. I can feel some male bonding coming. We gonna hug it out, Bishop?
M	BISHOP	No, I'm serious. Thank you. People don't... Anyway, it's been a long time, since someone did something for me. Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark.
M	STEVE	Happy Birthday, Arthur. Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink, ON BISHOP. Fighting what his guts are screaming at him. Are you all having fun! SHOUTS and NODS. LAUGHTER.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	I despise each and every one of you! MORE SHOUTS, LAUGHTER. Steve LEAPS out into space. Perfect Steve ERUPTS out of the water. Party ROARS back into life. Bishop surveys the room, checks drawers, peers down into the
F	LOUISE	Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some amazing E. You need to come try... Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think
M	STEVE	Give me a moment. I'll be right there. We'll do that amazing E. And he looks away, back down over the view. A resigned This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century. residence... Bishop approaches... takes it in. Touches "Accounts" and the Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image
M	BISHOP	Huh. His eyes dart to an image of his DINING ROOM. It looks like Son of a bitch... Come on, Steve. We need you.
M	BISHOP	Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it. Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash.
M	BARTENDER	That's too much. Bishop grabs the shot, down it. Pushes the empty shot and
M	BISHOP	I'm not going anywhere.
M	AN HOUR LATER	Another shot is put down on the bar, empty. Bishop wipes
M	FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR	...Intelligence services can listen to our calls. But what about the rest of the world?
M	FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)	Well, today the answer seems to be 'No" as outrage over the assassination of the Turkish envoy Bahar Miryem has forced the US to reverse its position, now saying that it will not make it support of Turkey's EU bid contingent on its cooperation in the security agreement. Miryem had always advocated for Turkish autonomy from Bartender hits a remote, annoyed. Channel changes to a 70's

M	BISHOP	Look, I'll give you my money, but you have to promise me you won't spend it all on lipstick and tampons. Ex Con #2 pulls a gun, puts it to Bishop's head.
M	EX CON #2	You wanna die right here, motherfucker? Bishop raises his eyes to the man. Not so drunk after all.
M	BISHOP	...Thank you. Steve...? Where are you, baby? Suddenly LIGHTS wash across the space. Bishop glances out: Steve watches Bishop signing, closing the door and moving ON BISHOP, tacking up pages, photographs, financials. We
M	STEVE	Hello? Bishop? He enters the study, sees the WALL, the night's work. In the
M	BISHOP (O.S.)	There you are. Bishop is leaning in from outside. Nods to Steve.
M	STEVE	So who is he?
M	BISHOP	...US Government. NSA. Very well protected.
M	STEVE	What happened to you?
M	BISHOP	You should see the other guy. Bishop TOSSES Steve an object, goes back outside. Steve
M	STEVE	What's that?
M	BISHOP	This... is liquid Semtex with a built in combustible. Very volatile. Nice and shiny once it dries. But don't... scratch it. Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the coin-sized
M	STEVE	So that's how we take him out?
M	BISHOP	No. That's just to focus the mind.
M	STEVE	You makes bombs to focus your mind.
M	BISHOP	What do you do? This one's different. They want it fast, and they don't want it to look like an accident. Someone wants to send a message.
M	STEVE	Like with my father.
M	BISHOP	Yes. Like that.
M	STEVE	Didn't think that was your style. First time for everything. Steve looks at Bishop. BOOM! Outside the explosion
M	STEVE	Jesus... Bishop puts a hand out.
M	BISHOP	There's something I haven't told you.
M	STEVE	What?
M	BISHOP	...I broke a rule. I brought you in without asking. So this hit, is a test. Of us, of our arrangement. If that man is breathing three days from now... then they'll need to make an example of us. Do you understand? Steve ... nods. Takes Bishop's hand who pulls him up.
M	STEVE	So what you're saying is you and I are stuck with each other.
M	BISHOP	I'm sorry.
M	STEVE	...For what?
M	BISHOP	For getting you into this --
M	STEVE	I knew what I was doing. Bishop considers, nods.
M	BISHOP	Get packed. Bishop steps back, lets Steve take the first look. Bishop
M	STEVE	...I count six... no seven at the main door. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: The front entrance of the NSA
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Jesus they've got US Marines in there. Two at the door, one... maybe another two out of sight. Bishop considers Steve, locked to the telescope, the sharp
M	BISHOP (O.S.)	Fifth floor, corner office. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Steve finds Dean, at his desk,
M	STEVE	... Alright, got him. He's at his desk. We could take the shot right from here.
M	BISHOP	Glass is three inches thick... Steve moves his hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	And has laser sensors. Steve laughs, suddenly walks away from the telescope. Bishop
M	STEVE	Alright, fine. What are we doing here? Who is this guy? P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean shouts into the phone,
M	BISHOP	Starting to get it?
M	STEVE	Yeah, I'm getting that this isn't a job. It's just a really complicated... suicide. Bishop smiles. Steve moves off, restless.
M	STEVE	You know, you can front sonofabitch all you want, Bishop. You're scared, too. You don't really know how we're going to pull it off, do you? You ever think there's some things that just can't be done?
M	BISHOP	Everyone has a death --
M	STEVE	Really? Because, this guy? I look at this guy, I don't see his death. I see my death. And I don't particularly like the view. Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean's office,
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	And you know, as much as I like the quality time, unless you can read lips, I don't exactly see what we're doing here... Steve glances at Bishop's pad where he's transcribing words:
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	You read lips. Bishop glances at Steve, puts his eye back to the camera. You any good with computers?
M	STEVE	Everybody out. I'm serious. Get the fuck off my property. A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in
F	LOUISE	Steve, baby...? Steve levels the gun at her.
M	STEVE	You, too. Steve's hands fly. The images are pieced together, enlarged, Did you get it?
M	STEVE	It's the US Attorney's office in New York. He's running. He's trying to get out. Steve, trying to read Bishop's face, ZOOMING in.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Do you think we're hitting him because of what he's done, or because he's trying to get away with what he's done?
M	BISHOP (O.S.)	Does it make a difference?
M	STEVE	...No, I don't suppose it does. A beat. The two men, far separated.
M	BISHOP (O.S.)	Do the angles. Find us a shot. Security's going to have the actual street locked down. But there's a residential street, perpendicular.
M	STEVE (V.O.)	High-end people. They'll put up with a sweep, but they're not going to allow an agent to spend the day. They reach an address. Bishop puts on a hat, some
M	STEVE	Besides, the angle isn't right, too flat. Except when they hit the stairs. It'll spread the group vertically. It's... the shot. Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each opens Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the
M	DEAN (O.S.)	Look, I don't care. Find her, I need to talk to her right now...
M	STEVE	You ever worry about the right and wrong of it all? I'm not talking about God, just... Whatever you feel here. BISHOP'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE: The US Attorney building.
M	BISHOP	It's a little late for --
M	STEVE	Come on. You're telling me you've never done anything just because it was the right thing to do, even if it didn't make any sense? You never took a chance like that? Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch.
M	BISHOP	Once I did...
M	STEVE	How'd that work out for you? Beat. Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large
M	BISHOP	We have a problem... Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives.
M	STEVE	There's no shot. What do we do? There's no shot. A moment more, and then Bishop MOVES. We travel with him, to
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Bishop...? And Bishop's out.
M	BISHOP	On your four. You see him? Coming up, a MAN in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear Steve and Bishop come abreast of him. WHAM! Steve pushes
M	BISHOP (CONT'D)	No. You're the shooter.
M	STEVE	When?
M	BISHOP	You'll know when. WITH THEM, MOVING, taking the corner onto the main street in Hey... Listen, I need you to go out of town for a few days. No, I know, but you have to trust me. Just go -- no, don't tell me where. Just go, okay. Okay? Yes, I'll call you soon, I gotta go... Bishop nods to Steve who heads up the stairs towards the A needle hits a record's surface. "Pleased to meet you, hope ON DEAN. Suddenly frozen. His handlers unsure what's going
M	DEAN	...Bishop? Bishop does NOTHING. Security reads Dean's fear, closes on
M	ACROSS THE STEPS	Bishop, for the moment forgotten by the security who have As he slams the shifter into REVERSE men line up in front,
M	BISHOP	Get in. Security are standing up, opening up, as Steve DIVES forward.
M	STEVE	Thanks.
M	BISHOP	Behind you. Steve has half a second to puzzle this one as the Driver Bishop raises the divider, steps on the gas. He notices a hand-held automatic weapon secured to the dash, IN THE REARVIEW: Bishop watches a pursuit car T-BONED by a Over his initial surprise, the Driver's trained, and good.
M	BISHOP	Get in front.
M	STEVE	Working on that...
M	BISHOP	Now! Bishop HAULS UP the E-Brake, putting the Limo into a SPIN. Bishop and Steve recover, roll out of the now exposed rear of
M	STEVE	We have got to go! Steve's pointing at the rear exit. It looks far away.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	You go for it, I'll cover you. Bishop takes in the exit, the gun in Steve's hand...
M	BISHOP	I'm sorry I brought you into this.
M	STEVE	Not now, Bishop, we have to --
M	BISHOP	It was... It was the only thing I knew how to teach you. Steve looks at him oddly, moved. Then...
M	STEVE	Don't worry about it, Bishop. I brought myself into this. Bishop considers this, nods. And he's UP AND FIRING towards
M	BISHOP	Go! ON STEVE. Clear shot at Bishop. A micro-second hesitation, Behind them, SWAT and COPS give chase. UP AHEAD, a van skids to a halt, SWAT pouring out. Bishop TWO COP cars close from outside. Bishop raises his weapon, The SOUND of a cop, distant outside, CHAMBERING a round into Both men DIVE to the ground, roll even as they switch to
M	WITH THE COPS	Firing. Bullets find exposed legs and arms, men stumble back
M	STEVE AND BISHOP	Almost at the same exact moment, the men switch their aim
M	BISHOP	...Why?
M	STEVE	You don't know? Tense beat. Glimpsed through shattered windows, SWAT
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Cover me. And with that Steve is RUNNING towards the outside... ... BEHIND STEVE, Bishop steps out, gun in each hand. Clean ON BISHOP. Angry like we've never seen him. Cold. Furious. Helicopters clatter above, bullets plink into dishware and
M	US ATTORNEY	...Something is wrong in this country. But today because of the actions of a few cowardly men, we may never know the true face of -- A voice announces boarding, drowning out the TV. Bishop WHAM! Bishop hits Steve with the fridge door, knocks the gun Bishop reels back against the wall as Steve picks up the gun
M	STEVE	You know, when they came to me... I said "Are you sure?" Bishop?" But They're right, aren't they?
M	STEVE	...You don't really like the work anymore. Bishop's voice comes from the darkness near the barn.
M	BISHOP	Maybe not. BLAM! BLAM! Steve SHOOTS as Bishop MOVES, finds cover.
M	STEVE	Yeah. That's... what did you call it? That's a prerequisite. Besides, I guess I had other reasons.
M	BISHOP	If it matters, today we killed the man who ordered the hit on your father.
M	STEVE	Yeah, but not the man who actually killed him. Steve advances, clearing the side of the barn, LINES his
M	BISHOP	Why'd you kill those other people?
M	STEVE	You really going moral high ground on me? Seriously? You might want to check your soapbox there, partner. BLAM! Steve fires just as Bishop SLIDES back, into the barn But that's the difference between us, isn't it? You're all alone, but you still... like people. You wish they liked you. Whereas I have people everywhere... and all I ever want, is to be alone. Steve hears BANGING coming from the barn.
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	There's no weapons in there, Bishop! I've... what did you teach me? I've controlled the situation. One hundred percent. BOOM! The barn door blast outwards as Bishop's vintage Steve squints and BOOOOOM! The propane tank ERUPTS in flame. When he rises, the interior of the car is an inferno. The Steve. Bleeding, bruised, victorious. INSIDE. Pictures bubble and peel before turning black in the Steve moves to his computer and punches in the password. Needle comes down, touches the record, the sweet sound of
M	BISHOP'S VOICE	...Steve, if you hear this, then it means you found the right moment to play the record. Good for you. It also means you had to scratch the needle across the surface of the record. Steve's eyes LOCK on the record player, the needle scratching Sorry it has to end this way. Steve's eyes dart to the portrait of Bishop. Its cold eyes
M	BISHOP (V.O.)	Every man has a death that's right for them. Every one. ... where a form, a heat shadow, has burnt into the charred
M	BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	A death so right that when it arrives, those who knew him will say "Yes, this is right..." The detective leans the body forward, and the shadow
M	BISHOP (V.O.)	"...This was always going to happen this way." Bishop gets out. Shaved, healthy, clean. He climbs onto the Freedom, laid out before him. He stares at it, wanting,
