M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	LOTTE	Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his pen. Good morning.
M	CRAIG	Morning.
F	LOTTE	Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
M	CRAIG	Enjoy.
F	LOTTE	Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
M	CRAIG	We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
F	LOTTE	Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
M	CRAIG	The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
F	LOTTE	Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
M	CRAIG	What?
F	LOTTE	Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
M	CRAIG	Which one is Elijah again?
F	LOTTE	The monkey.
M	CRAIG	Yeah. Okay.
M	TV ANNOUNCER	The crowd is enthralled as Derek Mantini, arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world, performs "The Belle of Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily Dickinson puppet, directed by the inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.
M	CHARLES NELSON REILLY	Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.
M	CRAIG	Gimmicky bastard.
F	LOTTE	Is the trial date set?
M	CRAIG	May 11th.
F	LOTTE	Why'd you do it, Craig?
M	CRAIG	I'm a puppeteer.
F	LOTTE	Why, Craig. why?
M	CRAIG	I... puppeteer.
F	LOTTE	You know, maybe you should speak to someone about this.
M	MAN #1	Seven and a half, right?
M	CRAIG	Uh. yeah.
M	MAN #1	I'll take you through it.
M	MAN #1	Seven and a half.
M	CRAIG	Thank you.
F	FLORIS	Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
M	CRAIG	No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
F	FLORIS	Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
M	CRAIG	Schwartz.
F	FLORIS	Pardon?
M	CRAIG	Schwartz.
F	FLORIS	I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
M	CRAIG	My name is Schwartz.
F	FLORIS	Money, Miss Warts?
M	CRAIG	Forget it.
F	FLORIS	Fork ah did?
F	FLORIS	Mr. Juarez?
M	CRAIG	Yes?
F	FLORIS	Yex?
M	CRAIG	I said "yes."
F	FLORIS	You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
F	LESTER	Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
M	CRAIG	Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
F	LESTER	Security.
M	CRAIG	No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
F	LESTER	She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you're implying.
M	CRAIG	Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
F	LESTER	Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
M	CRAIG	Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
F	LESTER	You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
M	CRAIG	Glooph is not a letter, sir.
F	LESTER	Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
F	LESTER	Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
M	FLORIS (O.S.)	Gehginnis ondah foam?
F	LESTER	Forget it.
F	FLORIS	Fork ah did?
F	LESTER	Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
M	CRAIG	You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
F	LESTER	Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
M	CRAIG	No.
F	LESTER	Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understand a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
M	CRAIG	No. I understand perfectly.
F	LESTER	Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
M	CRAIG	Just one. Why is this floor so short?
F	LESTER	Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation. Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin-Flemmer building. As you will now be spending your work day here, it is important that you learn a bit about the history of this famous floor.
F	WENDY	Hello, Don.
M	DON	Hello. Wendy.
F	WENDY	Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
M	DON	It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
M	DON	He would call this building the Mertin- Flemmer Building, after himself and someone else, who, local legend has it, was named Flemmer.
M	DON	One day. Captain Mertin received an unexpected visitor.
M	MERTIN	Enter ye, if ye dare enter.
M	TINY WOMAN	Captain Mertin?
M	MERTIN	What want ye, girl child?
M	TINY WOMAN	I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
M	MERTIN	I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
M	TINY WOMAN	I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
M	MERTIN	Aye. Speak then if ye must.
M	TINY WOMAN	Captain Mertin, surely I am a God- fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a married lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
M	MERTIN	Woman, your story moves me like no other. Me own sister was tiny and then died. Therefore, I shall make ye me wife. And I shall build a floor in my building, between the 7th and 8th, which will be scaled down, so from now on there shall be at least one place on God's green Earth that you and your accursed kind can live in peace...
M	DON	So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners. After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
F	WENDY	Ha ha ha!
M	CRAIG	Moving story.
F	MAXINE	Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
M	CRAIG	Is that true?
F	MAXINE	Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?
M	CRAIG	Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
F	MAXINE	How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
M	CRAIG	Emily Dickinson.
F	MAXINE	I wouldn't know.
M	PARROT	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
M	CRAIG	Shut up!
F	LOTTE	Sorry, honey.
M	PARROT	Sorry honey. Sorry honey.
M	NEIGHBOR (O.S.)	Shut up!
F	LOTTE	Sorry!
M	PARROT (O.S.)	Help! She's locking me in a cage!
F	LOTTE	Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
M	CRAIG	Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
F	LOTTE	Seven-ish
M	CRAIG	We have to make it an early night.
F	LOTTE	They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
M	CRAIG	Hmmm.
F	LOTTE	Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
M	CRAIG	Hmmm.
M	PETER	Good food, Lotte.
F	LOTTE	Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the way.
M	PETER	Vegetarian, right?
F	LOTTE	Yes. All vegetable. all the time.
M	PETER	Amazing.
M	PETER	No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor. Craig?
M	CRAIG	No kidding, Peter.
M	GLORIA	That's great. It almost sounds like make-believe. Like a storybook. like a fairy tale. It's really great. So Lotte, when you say all vegetable, do you mean all vegetable entirely?
M	GLORIA	Lotte told me that Eskimos have a lot of words for snow.
M	PETER	How many?
M	GLORIA	Ten, I think.
M	PETER	I wonder why so many.
M	GLORIA	Because they have a lot of snow. Isn't that interesting?
F	FLORIS	You're good.
M	CRAIG	Thank you, Floris.
F	FLORIS	You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
M	CRAIG	I am a trained performer.
F	FLORIS	Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
M	CRAIG	Hello again.
F	MAXINE	Yes, well...
M	CRAIG	You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
F	MAXINE	And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
M	CRAIG	No, really.
F	MAXINE	You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
F	LOTTE	New puppet?
M	CRAIG	Yeah, just an idea I had.
F	LOTTE	She's very beautiful.
M	CRAIG	Just an idea I had.
M	CRAIG	C'mon, let's go to bed.
M	CRAIG	I would too know what to do with you.
F	FLORIS	Oh, what magic those fingers could work on the right "cabinet." Alphabetize me, baby. And don't forget, I comes before U.
M	CRAIG	Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I'm in love with somebody else.
F	FLORIS	I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
F	LESTER	Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
M	CRAIG	I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
F	LESTER	One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
M	CRAIG	I'll keep that in mind, sir.
F	LESTER	No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
M	CRAIG	The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
F	LESTER	I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
M	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
F	LESTER	All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
M	CRAIG	Shit.
M	CRAIG	I won't be late. I just have to listen to Lester's sexual fantasies and drink carrot juice for a little while. It's a job thing.
M	CRAIG	I gotta go back to work. Yeah, okay. You too. Okay. Bye.
F	MAXINE	What?
M	CRAIG	I just wanted to say "hi." Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
F	MAXINE	Yeah.
M	CRAIG	How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
F	MAXINE	Why not?
M	CRAIG	Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn... Muhhhahhhhh... ahhhnnnaaa... nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll... tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa... nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa... Mahhhhhkkkkk... sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
F	MAXINE	Who told you?
M	CRAIG	I'm right?
F	MAXINE	Who told you?
M	CRAIG	That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
F	MAXINE	Somebody told you.
M	CRAIG	Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
F	MAXINE	I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
M	CRAIG	Maxine.
F	LESTER	Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. "Ladies," I begin. "I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
M	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
F	LESTER	Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
M	CRAIG	Yessir.
F	LESTER	Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
M	CRAIG	That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
M	CRAIG	Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
F	MAXINE	Just.
M	CRAIG	Buy you a drink, Maxine?
F	MAXINE	You married?
M	CRAIG	Yeah. But enough about me.
M	CRAIG	What'll you have?
F	MAXINE	The usual, Barry.
M	CRAIG	I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
M	CRAIG	I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
F	MAXINE	My tits?
M	CRAIG	No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
F	MAXINE	Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
M	CRAIG	That's the usual?
F	MAXINE	Don't let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
F	MAXINE	Set me up again, Barry.
M	CRAIG	I'm not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
F	MAXINE	You're a fag or a liar.
M	CRAIG	I mean, I am really attracted to you.
F	MAXINE	I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
M	CRAIG	No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
F	MAXINE	Good. Now we're getting somewhere. Not a chance.
F	MAXINE	So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
M	CRAIG	Well, I'm a puppeteer...
F	MAXINE	Check.
M	CRAIG	Hi.
F	LOTTE	Hi.
M	CRAIG	Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We're supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
F	LOTTE	Did you eat?
M	CRAIG	Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
F	LOTTE	I was worried.
M	CRAIG	I'm sorry. How was your evening?
F	LOTTE	Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
M	CRAIG	The ferret?
F	LOTTE	The iguana.
M	CRAIG	Right.
F	LOTTE	I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
M	CRAIG	Yeah. You want a beer?
F	LOTTE	No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
M	CRAIG	All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I'll be in soon. A little while.
F	LOTTE	'kay.
M	CRAIG	Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering? Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. Interesting. Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel what I feel? More than anything. Maxine. It's good in here, Craig. Better than your wildest dreams.
M	CRAIG	Hi.
F	MAXINE	You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
M	CRAIG	Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
F	MAXINE	Yikes.
M	CRAIG	Please, let me explain.
M	CRAIG	It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
F	MAXINE	You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
M	CRAIG	Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor.
M	CRAIG	Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love this.
F	LESTER	Yes?
M	CRAIG	Dr. Lester...
F	LESTER	Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see. Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
M	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and...
F	LESTER	Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
M	CRAIG	Thank you, sir.
F	LESTER	Put up reel 752.
M	DON	Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
F	WENDY	Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it's for.
M	DON	That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
M	WHITE	Hmmm. I must have a small store room to store my merchandise when I am through working on it. I know, I will build a tiny store room. How cute!
F	WENDY	Wow! That's some story, Don.
M	DON	Truth is stranger than fiction, Wendy!
M	CRAIG	Bullshit.
M	CRAIG	Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?
M	CRAIG	Holy shit! It's that actor guy. Shit! What's his name? That actor guy! What's happening? Am I inside him? Am I in his brain? Am I him? Is he me? Does he know I'm here? My brain is reeling! Is his brain reeling?
F	MAXINE	The puppeteer told me he loves me today. I know. I can't think of anything more pathetic.
M	MALKOVICH (V.O.)	The Broadhurst Theater, please.
M	CABBIE	Say, aren't you that actor guy?
F	MALKOVICH	Yeah.
M	CABBIE	John Makel... John Malkovich! Of course!
M	CABBIE	Mapplethorpe?
M	MALKOVICH (V.O.)	Malkovich.
M	CABBIE	Malkovich! John fucking Malkovich!
M	CABBIE	Yeah. I liked you in that one movie.
M	MALKOVICH (V.O.)	Thank you.
M	CABBIE	The one where you're that jewel thief.
F	MALKOVICH	I never played a jewel thief.
M	CABBIE	Who am I thinking of?
F	MALKOVICH	I don't know.
M	CABBIE	I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
F	MALKOVICH	Yeah, okay.
M	CRAIG (V.O.)	Ahhhh!
F	MAXINE	Absolutely, doll. I'm just about to close up here.
F	MAXINE	Meet you at "The Pig" in twenty minutes. Oh yeah, maybe I'll keep my legs closed till then. I'm splitting for the day. Lock up for me, won't you, darling.
M	CRAIG	Don't you want to know what happened to me?
F	MAXINE	No.
M	CRAIG	This is important!
F	MAXINE	It better be.
M	CRAIG	There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
F	MAXINE	Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
M	CRAIG	He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
F	MAXINE	What's he been in?
M	CRAIG	Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
F	MAXINE	Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
M	CRAIG	Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
F	MAXINE	Good. We'll sell tickets.
M	CRAIG	Tickets to Malkovich?
F	MAXINE	Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
M	CRAIG	But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
F	MAXINE	Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
M	CRAIG	You wanted to be partners with me?
F	MAXINE	Sure. It'd be fun.
M	CRAIG	Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
F	MAXINE	I'll protect you, Dollface.
M	CRAIG	Oh. Maxine.
F	LOTTE	Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
M	CRAIG	Brain, soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
F	LOTTE	I want to try.
M	CRAIG	What?
F	LOTTE	I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
M	CRAIG	Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
F	LOTTE	Now?
M	CRAIG	Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
M	CRAIG	I'll meet you on the turnpike.
F	LOTTE	I'm scared.
M	CRAIG	Me too, babe.
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	Holy cow! Oh, yes. Yes.
F	LOTTE	I have to go back.
M	CRAIG	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
F	LOTTE	I have to go back now.
M	CRAIG	We'll talk about it in the car.
F	LOTTE	I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
M	CRAIG	You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
F	LOTTE	I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.
M	CRAIG	Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
F	LESTER	Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
F	LOTTE	Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
F	LESTER	Oh, be still my heart.
F	LOTTE	Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
F	LESTER	With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
M	CRAIG	Dr. Lester...
F	LESTER	More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
M	CRAIG	No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
F	LESTER	I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
M	CRAIG	No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
F	LESTER	And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
M	CRAIG	Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
F	LESTER	The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain "doors" which should never be opened.
M	CRAIG	My kingdom for your portal, Maxine.
F	MAXINE	Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
M	CRAIG	Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
M	CRAIG	Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
F	LOTTE	Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
F	MAXINE	Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?
F	LOTTE	Yes, Hi.
M	CRAIG	Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.
F	LOTTE	Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
F	MAXINE	Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
M	CRAIG	Why aren't you at work?
F	LOTTE	I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
M	CRAIG	What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
F	LOTTE	Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
M	CRAIG	This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right. It's just the thrill of seeing through someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll pass.
F	LOTTE	Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
F	MAXINE	Let her go, Craig. I mean "him."
M	CRAIG	Yeah, okay. I'll pick you up.
F	MAXINE	You better hurry. Traffic.
F	MAXINE	Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich's home phone? That's great. Love ya and owe ya.
F	MALKOVICH	So you believe in God... you got something for it? You worked for all the capitalists. You harvested the fruit from your labor? You got God!
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	What raw, animal power!
F	MALKOVICH	But the past comforts you? The present smiles on you, yes?
F	MALKOVICH	Yeah?
M	MAXINE (O.S.)	Mr. Malkovich?
F	MALKOVICH	Who's calling?
M	MAXINE (O.S.)	You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
F	MALKOVICH	How'd you get this number?
M	MAXINE (O.S.)	It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
M	LOTTE (O.S.)	Oh, I like this.
F	MALKOVICH	Listen, this is not amusing. Please don't call here any...
M	MAXINE (O.S.)	Oho, such authority! MY nipples are at attention, General Malkovich, sir. So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at eight. Please, please meet me there. I just adored you in that jewel thief movie...
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	My God! Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there...
F	LOTTE	Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there...
M	CRAIG	How was it?
F	LOTTE	I have to go back tonight. At eight exactly.
M	CRAIG	Why?
F	LOTTE	Don't crowd me, Craig.
M	GUY	Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?
F	MALKOVICH	Yes.
M	GUY	Wow. You were really great in that movie where you played that retard.
F	MALKOVICH	Thank you very much.
M	GUY	I just wanted to tell you that. And say thank you. I have a cousin that's a retard, so, as you can imagine, it means a lot to me to see retards portrayed on the silver screen so compassionately.
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	Maxine!
F	MAXINE	Hi. I'm so glad you decided to come. I'm Maxine.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm John. I didn't think I was going to come, but I felt oddly compelled. I have to admit I was a bit intrigued by your voice.
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	God, she's beautiful. The way she's looking at me. At him. At us.
F	MAXINE	And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
F	MALKOVICH	Can I get you a drink?
F	MAXINE	Whatever you're having.
M	CRAIG	So how was it? What was he doing?
F	LOTTE	Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
M	CRAIG	You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
F	LOTTE	You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
M	CRAIG	I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
F	LOTTE	It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We'll smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away.
F	LOTTE	Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
M	CRAIG	After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
F	MAXINE	Ah.
F	LOTTE	After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.
F	MAXINE	The way I see it, the world is divide into those go after what they want and those who don't. The passionate ones, the ones who go after what they want, may not get what they want, but they remain vital, in touch with themselves, and when they lie on their deathbeds, they have few regrets. The ones who don't go after what they want... well, who gives a shit about them anyway?
M	CRAIG	You?
F	MAXINE	Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
M	CRAIG	My God.
F	MAXINE	Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. Thanks for a wonderful dinner. No hard feelings, partner.
F	LOTTE	I want a divorce.
M	CRAIG	Come in!
M	ERROLL	Hello, I'm here about the ad.
M	CRAIG	Please, have a seat.
M	ERROLL	When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
M	CRAIG	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
M	ERROLL	Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
F	MAXINE	No.
M	ERROLL	Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
F	MAXINE	No. Don't be an ass.
M	ERROLL	Can I be anyone I want?
F	MAXINE	You can be John Malkovich.
M	ERROLL	Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
F	MAXINE	Two hundred dollars, please.
M	ERROLL	Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
M	ERROLL	Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
M	CRAIG	Tell your friends.
M	ERROLL	Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
M	CRAIG	This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
F	MAXINE	So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
F	LESTER	You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. MA'AM.
M	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
F	LESTER	There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
M	CRAIG	You're insane.
F	LESTER	I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
F	MAXINE	Crackpot.
M	DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH	How much do we love you? We loved you in "Making Mr. Right." That is how much we love you. We even own the director's cut on laser disc. Please accept us into your head as we have accepted you into our hearts. Please let us be you. Amen.
F	LESTER	May I have your attention, please. We have a new disciple among us tonight.
M	DISCIPLES OF MALKOVICH	Hallelujah.
F	LESTER	She is the wife of Schwartz.
F	LOTTE	I'm getting divorced.
F	LESTER	No you mustn't, my child.
F	LOTTE	But why, Son of Malkovich?
F	LESTER	We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him... ...for lack of a better word.
F	LOTTE	What are you doing?
M	CRAIG	I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
F	LOTTE	Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
M	CRAIG	You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
F	LOTTE	I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
M	CRAIG	What?
F	LOTTE	I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
M	CRAIG	No they're not.
F	LOTTE	You've always hated the animals.
M	CRAIG	You've always loved the animals.
F	LOTTE	I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
M	CRAIG	What's that?
F	LOTTE	Us, of course.
M	CRAIG	Oh, Lot...
M	CRAIG	What about Maxine?
F	LOTTE	Fuck Maxine.
M	CRAIG	We wish.
F	MAXINE	Yes? I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
F	MAXINE	When?
M	LOTTE (O.S.)	Give me one hour to get inside him exactly.
F	MAXINE	Thanks so much for coming over.
F	MALKOVICH	Oh, I'm really glad you called.
F	MAXINE	So, do you enjoy being an actor?
F	MALKOVICH	Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
M	LOTTE (V.O.)	Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
F	MAXINE	I love you, Lotte. Maxine...
F	MALKOVICH	I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
F	MAXINE	Do you mind?
F	MALKOVICH	No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
F	MAXINE	Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
F	MALKOVICH	Yes, Maxine, yes. This is too good to be true.
M	CRAIG	You were him last night, weren't you?
F	LOTTE	Yes.
M	CRAIG	And he was with her.
F	LOTTE	We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
M	CRAIG	We?
F	LOTTE	Me and John.
M	CRAIG	Don't forget me.
F	LOTTE	Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
F	LOTTE	I'm sorry. That was nasty.
M	CRAIG	Life is confusing, isn't it?
F	LOTTE	Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
M	CRAIG	I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
F	MAXINE	You're late.
M	CRAIG	Are you torturing me on purpose?
F	MAXINE	I've fallen in love.
M	CRAIG	I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
F	MAXINE	You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
M	CRAIG	You're evil, Maxine.
F	MAXINE	Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
F	LESTER	Yes, my dear? Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
F	LESTER	Thank you, Floris. Think, Jew florist?
F	LESTER	Good morning, Lotte!
M	LOTTE (O.S.)	Dr. Lester, everything's falling apart.
F	LOTTE	I blew it, Dr. Lester.
F	LESTER	You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
F	LOTTE	But now we've lost access to Craig.
F	LESTER	My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
F	LOTTE	I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
M	CRAIG	Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
F	LOTTE	Suck my dick!
M	CRAIG	Shut up!
M	CRAIG	Tell her you need to see her.
F	LOTTE	You bastard.
M	MAXINE (V.O.)	J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
F	LOTTE	I have to see you. Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
M	CRAIG	Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
F	LOTTE	What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
M	MAXINE (V.O.)	Oooh, doll. I love this new devil- may-care side of you. Alrighty, I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll see both of you in one hour. Exactamundo.
F	LOTTE	Help! He's locking me in a cage!
M	NEIGHBOR	Shut up!
M	PARROT	Shut up!
M	CRAIG	Lesson number one: Be careful what you teach your parrot.
F	MALKOVICH	Tommy, can I take fifteen?
F	MAXINE	Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...
F	MALKOVICH	Maxine... I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
M	CRAIG	You're glowing again.
F	MAXINE	A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
M	CRAIG	It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
F	LOTTE	It'll never happen, fuckface.
M	CRAIG	Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
F	LOTTE	What's that?
M	CRAIG	I'm a puppeteer.
F	MAXINE	Lotte, this is so good... Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
M	CRAIG	Holy shit, yes!
F	MALKOVICH	Holy shit, yes!
M	CRAIG (V.O.)	Holy shit! He said what I said!
F	MALKOVICH	Holy shit! He said what I said!
F	MAXINE	Lotte? Is that you?
M	CRAIG (V.O.)	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
F	MALKOVICH	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
F	MAXINE	Oh, Lotte...
F	MALKOVICH	Something was making me talk. Some goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
F	MAXINE	Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
F	MALKOVICH	No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
M	CRAIG	I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm across your girlfriend's glorious tit. I made him talk. And, oh, there was the beginning of sensation in the fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a matter of practice before Malkovich becomes nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my worktable. Coffee?
F	MALKOVICH	It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
M	KEVIN BACON	I'm sure you're not going crazy.
F	MALKOVICH	Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
M	KEVIN BACON	Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
F	MALKOVICH	Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
M	KEVIN BACON	You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
F	MALKOVICH	I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
M	KEVIN BACON	Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
M	KEVIN BACON	You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
F	MALKOVICH	I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
M	KEVIN BACON	All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
F	MALKOVICH	I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
M	KEVIN BACON	The truth is for suckers, Johnny- Boy.
F	MALKOVICH	Excuse me, what type of service does this company provide?
M	FAT MAN	You get to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.
F	MALKOVICH	I see.
M	FAT MAN	No cutting, by the way.
M	FAT MAN	No cutting!
M	CRAIG	Hey! Break it up! Break it up! Everybody gets a chance to be...
M	FAT MAN	It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr. Malkovich! I hope me and my associates from Overeaters Anonymous didn't hurt you too terribly.
F	MALKOVICH	Inside.
F	MAXINE	Darling!
F	MALKOVICH	What the fuck is going on?
M	CRAIG	Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
F	MALKOVICH	Simulates?
M	CRAIG	Sure, after a fashion.
F	MALKOVICH	Let me try.
M	CRAIG	You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
F	MALKOVICH	Let me try!
F	MAXINE	Let him try.
M	CRAIG	Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
F	MALKOVICH	Jesus.
M	CRAIG	What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
F	MAXINE	How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
M	GIRL MALKOVICH	Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich...
M	WAITER MALKOVICH	Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich?
M	GIRL MALKOVICH	Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich.
M	WAITER MALKOVICH	Malkovich Malkovich. Malkovich?
F	MALKOVICH	Malkovich!
M	WAITER MALKOVICH	Malkovich.
M	SINGING MALKOVICH	Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich...
M	CRAIG	So how was it?
F	MALKOVICH	That... was... no... simulation.
M	CRAIG	I know. I'm sorry...
F	MALKOVICH	I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
M	CRAIG	Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
F	MALKOVICH	This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
M	CRAIG	With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
F	MALKOVICH	It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
M	CRAIG	And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court?
M	MOTORIST	Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!
F	LOTTE	Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
M	CRAIG	Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
F	LOTTE	You fell in love with her first.
M	CRAIG	Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
F	LOTTE	You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
M	CRAIG	That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
F	LOTTE	Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
M	CRAIG	Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
F	LOTTE	I need a shower.
M	CRAIG	I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
F	LOTTE	You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
M	CRAIG	I love you so much.
M	CRAIG	But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
M	MAXINE (O.S.)	J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
F	LOTTE	We have to meet.
F	MAXINE	One hour.
M	CRAIG	I'll tell you all about it when I get home.
M	SAFARI MAN	Well, there monkeys ain't going nowhere. Let's get us a couple a brews 'fore the boss comes back...
M	CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)	Son, untie your mother and me! Quickly! Before the great bald chimp- men return.
M	CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)	Hurry, Elijah!
M	SAFARI MAN	Why you little bastard!
F	LOTTE	Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!
F	LOTTE	Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
M	MAXINE (O.S.)	Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
F	LOTTE	But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved. I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
F	LOTTE	Hello, Dr. Lester?
F	MALKOVICH	Come on in.
F	MAXINE	I can explain about the portal, darling.
F	MALKOVICH	Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
F	MAXINE	Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there?
F	MALKOVICH	Yes. How did you know it was me?
F	MAXINE	Lotte called me.
F	MALKOVICH	Oh, so the bitch escaped.
F	MAXINE	Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm getting better all the time.
F	MAXINE	I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
F	MALKOVICH	No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
F	LESTER	You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
F	LOTTE	Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
F	LESTER	Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
F	LOTTE	No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
F	LESTER	What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
F	LOTTE	No, I didn't know that.
F	LESTER	Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
F	LOTTE	No.
F	LESTER	Oh, sorry. Right this way.
M	LESTER ON FILM	Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. As you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world.
M	LESTER ON FILM	His name is John Horatio Hannibal Malkovich. And we are the keepers of the door to his soul. One day, when his brain is big enough, we will all journey into his head and live there for all eternity. Following the teachings of our leader Karl Marx, we will build the ultimate communist community, one body and hundreds, maybe thousands, of brains inside working together to form a super human intellect capable of curing disease, stopping all war, and ruling the world with a benevolent fist. We will take a wife, a woman of uncommon beauty and intellect, who is, as yet, still an infant herself.
M	LESTER ON FILM	Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella DeMent.
F	LOTTE	Does Floris know that she's the chosen?
F	LESTER	Well, I tried to explain it to her, but...
F	MAXINE	You still there, sweets?
F	MALKOVICH	Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
F	MAXINE	Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
F	MALKOVICH	You mean with Malkovich?
F	MAXINE	I'd love to see your work.
F	MALKOVICH	Really? Yeah. Okay.
F	MALKOVICH	I'll do something I call "Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."
F	MAXINE	That was incredible. You're brilliant!
F	MALKOVICH	You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
F	MAXINE	You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
F	MAXINE	Stay in him forever?
F	MALKOVICH	No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
F	MAXINE	Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
F	MALKOVICH	No! Please! Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
F	MAXINE	No one would ever have to know its not him.
F	MALKOVICH	Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
F	MAXINE	Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
F	LOTTE	I have sinned, unwittingly, against the community. And for this I am truly sorry.
M	MAN #2	W-w-what's it like on the inside?
F	LOTTE	Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.
M	MAN #2	Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say it's time.
F	LESTER	Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're all prepared, and perhaps this Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand a bit. We will enter the portal tonight!
F	MALKOVICH	Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
F	MAXINE	It's okay, my sweet.
F	LESTER	Aaaahhhh, the portal!
F	LOTTE	You bastard!
F	LESTER	No! Don't harm the vessel!
F	LOTTE	It's Craig in there, I can tell.
F	LESTER	I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
M	CRAIG	Squatter's rights, Lester.
F	MAXINE	Now excuse us, we have an entertainment legend to create.
F	LESTER	Clear the way for them, my friends. They will be dealt with in due time.
F	LESTER	Now, let's see what we can do to salvage this portal... for the sake of all that is good.
M	AGENT	Of course, send him right in. Don't ever keep him waiting again. Do you understand?
M	AGENT	John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
F	MALKOVICH	This is my fiancee Maxine.
M	AGENT	Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about the cunt at reception. Please have a seat.
M	AGENT	Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?
F	MAXINE	No thanks.
M	AGENT	Teresa, get me a chicken soup. Chicken soup?
F	MALKOVICH	I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
M	AGENT	Okay.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
M	AGENT	Oh yeah, he's good.
F	MALKOVICH	...and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
F	MAXINE	Vegas.
F	MALKOVICH	Vegas. Can you arrange that?
M	AGENT	Sure, sure. Just let me make a couple of calls.
M	MAN #2	That's the last of it, boss.
F	LESTER	Well, let's see what we've got here.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	My God, where am I? This seems so familiar.
M	LESTER (V.O.)	My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker! Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!
M	DIRECTOR	Cut!
M	LESTER (V.O.)	Oh, I'm just the actor in that Twilight Zone episode.
F	LESTER	Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
F	LOTTE	Why not? I need to get in there!
F	LESTER	I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
F	LOTTE	That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
F	LESTER	I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
M	MAN #3	Oooh, I got an idea! What if we build another portal to Malkovich, like around back, and sneak in that way?
M	MAN #4	Only Captain Mertin knew how to build a portal, dummy, and he's dead!
F	LESTER	Actually, my friends, I suppose its time I told you, I'm Captain James Mertin.
F	LESTER	You see, Lester is an anagram for Mertin.
F	LESTER	It used to work, I'm sure of it.
F	LESTER	Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.
M	MAN #3	How can this be? I thought you were only one hundred and five years old. Mertin would have to be...
F	LESTER	I'm two hundred and five, truth be told.
M	WOMAN #1	You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
F	LESTER	Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
M	MAN #2	So what exactly are you saying? Are we in cahoots with the Dark Master here?
F	LESTER	Surprise.
F	LESTER	Wait! It's not that bad! When we get into Malkovich, we still get to rule the world, just like I told you. The only difference is that we rule in the name of evil, instead of good.
M	MAN #3	That's the only difference?
F	LESTER	Absolutely.
F	LESTER	So anyway...
F	LOTTE	Well, I for one, am resigning. I will not serve evil. I am ashamed of all of you.
F	LESTER	My dear, let me assure you that when we attain power, it will be much more pleasant for those inside Malkovich, than for those outside.
F	LOTTE	I'll take my chances.
F	LESTER	Anybody else?
M	WOMAN #1	Do we get to wear a crown?
F	LESTER	But of course.
M	WOMAN #1	Count me in.
F	LESTER	Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
M	FLEMMER	Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
F	LESTER	And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
M	FLEMMER	Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
F	LESTER	Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
M	FLEMMER	Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? Nice to meet you all.
F	LOTTE	Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're not human. People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I've lost my heart to two of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I'm no better. Look at the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I've been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I set you free.
F	LOTTE	Good-bye, friends.
F	LOTTE	Hello, friend.
F	LOTTE	They've come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know too much. I should get the door. It's impolite to keep death waiting.
F	MAXINE	This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto- change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
F	MAXINE	Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
F	MALKOVICH	He's a selfish bastard.
M	ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	Ladies and gentlemen, it is the great privilege of the Luxor hotel and Casino to present Craig Schwartz and his magical puppet John Malkovich.
F	LESTER	Blasphemous bastard.
F	LESTER	Pretty good though.
M	USHER	Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid there's not an empty seat in the entire house.
M	MANTINI	Make one empty.
M	USHER	Y-y-y-es sir.
F	LESTER	Not too shabby.
M	MANTINI	Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.
F	LOTTE	They're going to take over the world, Elijah. Evil will reign. But, then, evil already reigns, doesn't it? So what difference does it make if John Malkovich is wearing the fucking crown while it's reigning?
M	FLEMMER	It's open.
F	LESTER	It's just me, boss. I brought croissants.
M	FLEMMER	Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
F	LESTER	We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
M	FLEMMER	Vegas? What'd you think?
F	LESTER	The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
M	FLEMMER	Impressions? Those are hard.
F	LESTER	Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
M	FLEMMER	I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
F	LESTER	A scary dream?
M	FLEMMER	No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
F	LESTER	I like that.
F	MALKOVICH	They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz -- The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
F	MAXINE	Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
F	MALKOVICH	Sleepy suddenly.
F	MAXINE	Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
M	CRAIG	Who are you?
M	FLEMMER	I am the Devil.
M	CRAIG	Oh.
M	FLEMMER	Leave Malkovich. He is mine.
M	CRAIG	Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.
F	MAXINE	Bad dream, darling?
F	MALKOVICH	I've got to leave Malkovich.
F	MAXINE	You've got to be kidding.
F	MALKOVICH	I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
F	MAXINE	Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream.
M	FLEMMER	Shit.
F	MALKOVICH	Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
F	MAXINE	Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
F	MAXINE	Yeah what?!
F	MALKOVICH	Derek Mantini!
M	MANTINI	Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
F	MALKOVICH	Did you see the reviews?
M	MANTINI	Yeah, I saw them.
F	MALKOVICH	Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
F	MAXINE	I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich.
M	MANTINI	Very impressive. I could use a producer with your vision. And other outstanding attributes.
F	MALKOVICH	She's not available.
M	MANTINI	We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
F	MAXINE	Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
M	MANTINI	I won't waste your time Schwartz, or more importantly, mine. Here's my proposal: There's only room in this world for one "World's Greatest Puppeteer." Correct? So let's allow the puppet-going public to crown their king.
F	MALKOVICH	How do we do that?
M	MANTINI	A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
F	MALKOVICH	What's the play?
M	MANTINI	Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
F	MALKOVICH	Never heard of it.
M	MANTINI	Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
F	MALKOVICH	Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
M	MANTINI	Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
M	MANTINI	Great then.
F	MALKOVICH	Is there dancing?
M	MANTINI	No. Who needs dancing?
F	LESTER	How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
M	FLEMMER	No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
F	LESTER	What kind of circumstances?
M	FLEMMER	Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
F	LESTER	The Great Mantini?
M	FLEMMER	No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
F	LESTER	Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
M	FLEMMER	But I think I have another plan.
F	LESTER	Do tell. I love a good plan.
M	FLEMMER	Why are you being like this?
F	LESTER	I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
M	FLEMMER	Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
F	LESTER	Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
M	FLEMMER	I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
F	LESTER	I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
M	FLEMMER	Fine. Let's drop it.
F	LESTER	Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
M	FLEMMER	Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
F	LESTER	Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek. You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
F	LOTTE	I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
M	ELIJAH	It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
F	LOTTE	What have I become?
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Do you dream often?
F	MALKOVICH	Do you?
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
F	MALKOVICH	Says who?
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Says me. Do you dream often?
F	MALKOVICH	Do you?
F	MAXINE	Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer.
M	THEATERGOER #1	That Truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist.
M	THEATERGOER #2	It's a wooden performance, really. Get it? Wooden?
M	THEATERGOER #3	What's with the Malkovich puppet? He was much better in Vegas when he played the piano with his feet.
M	THEATERGOER #4	I hate it when they try to stretch. It's like Woody Allen.
M	THEATERGOER #5	They both stink! I'm going across the street to second act Miss Saigon.
F	MAXINE	You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, lover, 'cause right now you're running neck and neck with the dead president. And you're both in last place.
M	CHARLES NELSON REILLY	You're doing beautifully, my boy. I wept at the speech about your wife.
M	CHARLES NELSON REILLY	What the hell? Nyong-nyong! 'Why?... Why me?... Why -- ultimately -- Me?... Do you really imagine you can account for Me? Totally, infallibly, inevitably account for Me?... Poor Dr. Dysart!'
F	MALKOVICH	Eyes!... White eyes -- never closed! Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!... God seest!... God seest!... NO!
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Here... Here... Sssh... Sssh... Calm now... Lie back. Just lie back! Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In... Out... In... Out... That's it... In. Out... In... Out...
M	AUDIENCE MEMBER	That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine actor.
M	FLEMMER	Bastard is stealing my thunder.
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	All right! I'll take it away! He'll be delivered from madness. What then? He'll feel himself acceptable! What then?
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll erase the welts cut into his body by flying manes.
M	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses will be quite safe. You'll save your pennies every week, till you can change that scooter into a car...
M	ACTUAL TRUMAN	Where am I? Aren't I dead? Vote for Mantini!
F	MALKOVICH	Good-bye, Maxine.
F	MAXINE	Whatever.
F	MALKOVICH	I'm back! My nightmare is over.
M	FLEMMER	Okay, now!
F	MALKOVICH	I am your earthly king! Kneel before me!
M	CROWD	Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.
F	MALKOVICH	Greetings, my lowly subjects.
F	FLORIS	Great things, my lonely subtext?
F	MALKOVICH	Boy, be careful what you wish for. Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, will you?
F	MALKOVICH	I am bored. You will dance for your king now.
F	MALKOVICH	Faster! Faster, my little trained monkeys!
M	ELIJAH	Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
F	LOTTE	Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
M	ELIJAH	If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
F	LOTTE	Hush, sweetheart.
F	LOTTE	I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
M	ELIJAH	Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
M	PARROT	Good-bye. Good-bye.
F	LOTTE	My God!
M	CRAIG	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
F	LOTTE	I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
M	CRAIG	He's a lucky man. Do I know him?
F	LOTTE	It's Elijah.
M	CRAIG	The iguana?
F	LOTTE	The monkey.
M	CRAIG	Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
F	LOTTE	A better friend.
M	CRAIG	I'm sorry for everything.
F	LOTTE	It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
M	CRAIG	You came up here looking for the portal?
F	LOTTE	Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
M	CRAIG	And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
F	LOTTE	You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
M	CRAIG	I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
F	LOTTE	I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
M	CRAIG	You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
F	LOTTE	People make mistakes.
M	CRAIG	I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
F	LOTTE	I know.
M	CRAIG	I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
F	LOTTE	Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
F	LOTTE	Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.
M	CRAIG	I love you, Lotte.
M	MANTINI	I can't wait to see where you and your friends live, Lotte.
M	LOTTE (O.S.)	It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.
M	FLEMMER	One serpent, coming up.
