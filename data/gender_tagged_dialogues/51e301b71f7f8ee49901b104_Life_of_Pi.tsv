M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WRITER (V.O.)	You were raised in a zoo?
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Born and raised in Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India. My father owned the zoo, and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist who was there to check on the Bengal Monitor Lizard. Mother and I were both healthy...
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	but the poor lizard escaped and was trampled by a frightened cassowary...
M	ADULT PI	The way of karma; the way of God.
M	WRITER	I assumed your father was a mathematician - because of your name.
M	ADULT PI	Oh, far from it. I was named after a swimming pool.
M	WRITER	There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?'
M	ADULT PI	You see, my uncle, Francis, was born with too much water in his lungs. They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such a great swimmer.
M	WRITER	Is Francis actually your uncle? He said he was friends with your father.
F	PI	I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary uncle' - my father's best friend, my swimming guru.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	I trained with him three times a week at the ashram. His lessons would save my life in the end...
M	MAMAJI	A mouthful of water will not harm you - but panic will.
M	MAMAJI (CONT'D)	Remember to breathe. Don't hold your breath. Good boy.
M	ADULT PI	I hope you don't mind vegetarian.
M	WRITER	No, not at all... And your name?
M	ADULT PI	Hmm?
M	WRITER	You - you were going to tell me how you got your name, I think.
M	ADULT PI	I got it from something Mamaji once told my father. Most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys - but not Mamaji. Mamaji collects swimming pools.
M	ADULT PI (CONT'D)	He swims in every pool he comes upon...
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	One day Mamaji said to my father that of all the pools in the world, the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris. That the water there was so clear you could make your morning coffee with it, that a single swim there changed his life. Before I was born, he said to my father, "If you want your son to have a clean soul, you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor." I never understood why my father took this so much to heart...
M	ADULT PI	... but he did, and I was named "Piscine Molitor Patel."
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Imagine me trying to explain that name to my schoolmates. I barely made it to the age of eleven before... Hey PISCINE!
M	BULLY #1 (CONT'D)	Are you Pissing right now?
M	ANOTHER BOY	Look at him he's Pissing!
M	ADULT PI (VO)	With one word my name went from an elegant French swimming pool to a stinking Indian latrine. I was Pissing everywhere.
M	BULLY #2	No Pissing in the schoolyard!
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Even the teachers started doing it - not deliberately, of course...
M	SCIENCE TEACHER	So then - what might occur if we release gas too quickly? Pissing?
M	BOY	He said Pissing!
M	SCIENCE TEACHER	That's enough - order!
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	When we returned the next year for our first day of school, I was prepared.
M	BOY	Present sir.
M	HISTORY TEACHER	Piscine Patel...
M	PI (AT 12)	Good morning. I am Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as... ... "Pi," the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet...
M	PI (CONT'D)	... which is also used in mathematics to represent the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter - an irrational number of infinite length, usually rounded 3.14. PI.
M	HISTORY TEACHER	Very impressive, Pi. Now sit down. And from then on you were Pi?
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Well, no. Not quite ...
M	BULLY #2	Nice try, Pissing.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	But I still had the whole day ahead of me. French Class was next... Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel - dit'Pi'... Then Geography...
M	PI (12)	These are the first twenty decimal places of Pi.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	My last class of the day was Mathematics....
M	LIBRARIAN	Slowly, Slowly! Slowly, Slowly!
M	LIBRARIAN	It is right... He's really doing this!
M	ALL	1! 4! 9! 3! 1! PI! PI! PI! By the end of that day, I was Pi Patel, school legend.
M	WRITER	Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, too. Out there all alone -
M	ADULT PI	I don't even know how to sail. And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me.
M	WRITER	Richard Parker...? Mamaji didn't tell me everything. He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal. So what were you doing in Pondicherry?
M	WRITER	Writing a novel.
M	ADULT PI	By the way, I enjoyed your first book. The new one, is it set in India?
M	WRITER	No, Portugal, actually. But it's cheaper living in India.
M	ADULT PI	Ah. Well, I look forward to reading it.
M	WRITER	You can't. I threw it out. Two years trying to bring it to life, and then one day it sputtered, coughed, and died.
M	ADULT PI	I'm sorry.
M	WRITER	was in a coffee house in one afternoon, mourning loss, when this old man at the table struck up a
M	ADULT PI	Mamaji. He does that.
M	WRITER	I told him about my abandoned he said: a Canadian who's come to India in search of a story. my friend, I know an Indian French Canada who has the most story to tell. It must fate that the two of you should
M	ADULT PI	haven't spoken about Richard in so many years... What has already told you?
M	WRITER	said you had a story that would me believe in God.
M	ADULT PI	would say that about a nice As for God, I can only tell my story; you will decide for what you believe.
M	WRITER	enough.
M	ADULT PI	see, then - where to begin?
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Pondicherry is the "French Riviera of India." In the streets closest to the ocean, you might think you were in the South of France.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	A few blocks inland, there's a canal; just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry...
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	And the Muslim Quarter is just to the West.
M	ADULT PI	When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954, the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	My father, who was a clever businessman, came up with one. He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo in the local Botanical Gardens instead.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the Gardens. They met, married, and a year later my brother Ravi was born. I came two years after that.
M	WRITER	It sounds magical, growing up in-
M	ADULT PI	Amen. Let's eat.
M	WRITER	I didn't know Hindus said 'amen.'
M	ADULT PI	Catholic Hindus do.
M	WRITER	Catholic Hindus?
M	ADULT PI	We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one.
M	WRITER	But you're a Hindu first? None of us knows God until someone introduces us. I was first introduced to God as a Hindu. There are 330 million gods in the Hindu religion - how can I not come to know a few of them? I met Krishna first...
M	MOTHER (V.O., IN TAMIL)	Yashoda once accused baby Krishna of eating dirt: "Tut, tut, you naughty boy - you shouldn't do that..."
F	PI	...But he didn't!
M	MOTHER	That's what he told her. "I didn't eat dirt!" "No? Well, then open your mouth." So Krishna opened his mouth.
M	MOTHER (TAMIL) (CONT'D)	And what do you think Yashoda saw? What?
M	MOTHER (TAMIL)	She saw in Krishna's mouth the whole entire universe.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	The gods were my superheroes growing up. Hanuman, the monkey god, lifting an entire mountain to save his friend Lakshmana. Ganesh, the elephantheaded, risking his life to defend the honor of his mother Parvati. Vishnu, the Supreme Soul, the source of all things. Vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean and we are the stuff of his dreaming.
M	FATHER	Spectacle. Don't let the stories and pretty lights fool you, boys. Religion is darkness.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	My dear 'Appa' believed himself part of the 'new India.' As a child, he'd had polio; he used to lie in bed, wracked with pain, wondering where God was. In the end, God didn't save him; Western medicine did. My 'Amma' went to college and thought her family was part of the 'new India' as well - until her parents cut her off because they thought she was marrying beneath her. Her religion was the only link she had to her past.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	I met Christ in the mountains when I was 12. We were visiting relatives, tea growers in Munnar. It was our third day there; Ravi and I were terribly bored.
M	RAVI (14)	Challenge. I'll give you two rupees. Run into that church and drink the Holy water.
M	PRIEST	You must be thirsty. Here, I brought you this.
F	PI	Why would a god do that? Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?
M	PRIEST	Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us - human - so we could understand Him.
M	PRIEST (CONT'D)	We can't understand God in all His perfection, but we can understand God's son and His suffering as we would a brother's.
M	ADULT PI	That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty? What kind of love is that? But this Son - I couldn't get Him out of my head.
F	PI	If God is so perfect and we're not, why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all?
M	PRIEST	All you have to know is that He loves us. "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son." This Son taught us to love one another...
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	The more I listened to the priest, the more I came to like this Son of God.
F	PI	Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ, but God wasn't finished with me yet. God works in mysterious ways - and so it was He introduced Himself again, this time by the name of Allah.
M	FATHER	This lamb is exquisite - it's best dish on the table. You are all missing out... only need to convert to three religions, Piscine, and you spend your life on holiday.
M	RAVI	you going to Mecca this year, Jesus? Or to Rome, for your as Pope Pi-us?
M	MOTHER	stay out of this, Ravi. Just as like cricket, Pi has his own
M	FATHER	Gita, Ravi has a point, no? You follow three different at the same time,
F	PI	not?
M	FATHER	believing in everything at same time is the same as not in anything at all.
M	MOTHER	young Santosh - he's still his way.
M	FATHER	how can he find his way if he not choose a path? instead of leaping from one to the next, why not start reason? In a few hundred science has taken us farther understanding the universe than has in ten thousand.
M	MOTHER	is true. Your father is right. can teach us more about out there - but not what is in here. Art, literature - they all spring our faith.
M	FATHER	Some eat meat, some eat vegetable. I do not expect us all to agree about everything. But I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. And that begins with thinking rationally. Do you understand?
M	FATHER (CONT'D)	Good.
F	PI	I would like to be baptized.
M	WRITER	So you're a Christian and a Muslim?
M	ADULT PI	And a Hindu, of course.
M	WRITER	And a Jew, I suppose?
M	ADULT PI	Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms.
M	WRITER	But no room for doubt?
M	ADULT PI	Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is useful. It keeps faith a living thing. After all, you can't know the strength of your faith until it's been tested.
M	RAVI	Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in here without him.
F	PI	Stop worrying. I have seen him do this a thousand times. I want to meet our new tiger.
M	RAVI	Pi!...
F	PI	Hello! Richard Parker!
M	WRITER	A tiger? Richard Parker was a tiger?
M	ADULT PI	He got his name through a clerical error. A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo - but the names got switched on the paperwork. The hunter was listed as Thirsty and tiger was called Richard Parker. We laughed about it and the name stuck.
M	RAVI	Let's go. Before we get into trouble.
F	PI	I want to see him close up.
M	RAVI	You're not a zoo keeper. Come on!
F	PI	That's it, Richard Parker. It's for you.
M	FATHER	No!!! What are you thinking?! Are you out of your mind? Who gave you permission to come back here? You have just ignored everything I have ever taught you!
F	PI	I just wanted to say 'Hello' to him.
M	FATHER	You think that tiger is your friend. He is an animal, not a playmate!
F	PI	Animals have souls. I've seen it in their eyes.
M	FATHER	Find Selvam!
M	SELVAM	You're sure, Mr. Patel? Pi's just a kid.
M	FATHER	Do it. Go ahead. Animals don't think like we do; people who forget that get themselves killed. That tiger is not your friend. When you look into his eyes, you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you - nothing else.
M	RAVI	Don't be stupid! Say you're sorry.
M	MOTHER	What have you done, Piscine? You know what your father said about coming back here.
F	PI	I'm sorry. I was...
M	MOTHER	What are you thinking?
M	FATHER	This is between a father and his sons. Selvam, the gate.
M	MOTHER	He said he's sorry. You want to scar them for life?
M	FATHER	Scar them? That boy almost lost his arm!
M	MOTHER	But he's still a boy!
M	FATHER	He will be a man sooner than you think, and this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget. Selvam. ... and so has placed the country in a State of Emergency.
M	NEWS ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)	Under the directive, the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be placed under the direct authority of the central government. Police will be granted powers to arrest and indefinitely detain citizens responsible for the uprising. Unauthorized... Things changed after the day of Appa's lesson. The world had lost some of its enchantment. School was a bore - nothing but facts, fractions and French. Words and patterns that went on and on. I grew restless, searching for something that would bring meaning into my life. And then I met Anandi...
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Mother made me study music, and one day my teacher came down with the flu; he asked if I could take his place one afternoon playing rhythms for a dance class.
M	DANCE MASTER	No. If you do not concentrate, you cannot express your love of God through dance. Feel the ground beneath your feet;
M	DANCE MASTER (CONT'D)	open your gaze out onto the horizon, let that spiritual energy pulse through you and out into the world through abinea. Anandi, come to the front; lead them.
F	ANANDI	Why are you following me?
F	PI	What?
F	ANANDI	You were following me.
F	PI	What does this mean?
M	PI (CONT'D)	In the dance, you went from Pataka, which means the forest, and then you did-then you did Samputa, which means something that is hidden, and after that you did this... and then you did Chatura. But at the very end you did this... None of the other dancers did that. What did you mean? The God of love is hiding in the forest?
F	ANANDI	No - that also means the lotus flower.
F	PI	The lotus flower is hiding in the forest? Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?
F	PI	And this is Richard Parker. He's the most magnificent creature we've ever had here. Look at the way he's turning his head. Showing off - like a dancer.
F	ANANDI	No, he heard something - he's listening. You see?
M	FATHER	So...you see? We have talked about it for some time... Do you understand what I'm saying? Pi?
F	PI	Sorry. You've been...
M	FATHER	Worried. For my family. Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India, and if the town council stops supporting us, I don't know where we'll be. So... it is what we have to do. Do you understand?
F	PI	I'm sorry... what are we talking about?
M	RAVI	We are leaving India.
F	PI	What??
M	MOTHER	We are selling the zoo.
M	FATHER	The zoo itself was never ours to sell - the land belongs to the town. But the animals are ours, and if we sell them, we will have enough to start a new life.
F	PI	But where would we go? Our life is here Appa!
M	FATHER	Canada. I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg. I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America; we can get freighter passage for the whole family. So, it is settled. We will sail like Columbus!
F	PI	But Columbus was looking for India! It takes a lot of work to sell a zoo; before we left Anandi and I had time enough to break each other's hearts. Of course, I promised I'd come back one day... It's funny... I remember everything else about our last day, but I don't remember saying goodbye...
M	MOTHER	Pi, they're serving dinner below.
M	MOTHER (CONT'D)	Piscine, You have a whole life ahead of you. We're doing this for you and Ravi. Come inside and have some dinner.
M	MOTHER	My sons and I are vegetarians. Do you have anything - ?
M	MOTHER (CONT'D)	No - no! Not more gravy.
M	FRENCH COOK	You don't want gravy?
M	MOTHER	No, I want something vegetarian. I-
M	FRENCH COOK	There. No problems.
M	FATHER	She asked if you have something vegetarian.
M	FRENCH COOK	Vegetarian - the cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian.
M	FATHER	Very funny. But she doesn't eat liver.
M	FRENCH COOK	Then she can eat the sausages, the rice, the gravy. Or you can go cook your own food.
M	FATHER	How dare you talk to my wife like that?
M	FRENCH COOK	Here's your rice. I cook for sailors, not curry eaters.
M	FATHER	What did you call us??
M	FRENCH COOK	Let go of me!
M	FATHER	Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a servant!
M	FRENCH COOK	I feed people! You feed monkeys!
M	FATHER	I'll teach you respect!
M	A SHORT TIME	LATER -
M	TAIWANESE SAILOR	Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I eat rice next to gravy. On ship, gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay? You try?
M	FATHER	Don't worry - we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.
F	PI	Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's not going to cause any trouble.
M	FATHER	The stress of traveling is not good for the animals.
M	FATHER (CONT'D)	And it helps with the seasickness. We don't want to be cleaning up after a seasick orangutan, do we?
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	My father was a businessman - he had never handled the animals himself. I realized that leaving India must have been harder for him than it was for me.
M	WRITER	... So...
M	ADULT PI	Have I forgotten anything?
M	WRITER	I think you've set the stage. So far we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool on a Japanese ship full of animals heading to Canada.
M	ADULT PI	Yes. Now we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific, and
M	WRITER	And make me believe in God.
M	ADULT PI	Yes. We'll get there. It was four days out of Manila - above the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on earth...
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	Our ship, the Tsimtsum, pushed on, bullishly indifferent to its surroundings. It moved with the slow, massive confidence of a continent.
F	PI	Ravi? Did you hear that? Ravi?
M	RAVI	... I'm sleeping.
F	PI	It's a thunderstorm! Let's go watch!
M	RAVI	Are you crazy? We'll get hit by lightning.
F	PI	No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge first.
M	RAVI	Don't tempt a storm, Pi.
F	PI	More rain, lord of storms! Let it rage!
F	PI	AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT!
F	PI	HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Please save my family!
M	JAPANESE CAPTAIN	Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here.
M	JAPANESE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)	Here, put this on!
F	PI	You have to help them, please! Oh no my family, please. You have to help them, my family is back there.
M	JAPANESE CAPTAIN	We don't have time.
M	TAIWANESE SAILOR	We help. You must go.
F	PI	Who let all the animals out?
M	SAILOR #1	You have to go now.
F	PI	No wait! My father - he can't swim -
M	JAPANESE CAPTAIN	This is your last chance--just go!
F	PI	No please!
M	SAILOR #1	Hey! You! What are you doing?!
M	FRENCH COOK	Loosen the lines! Bring it down!
M	SAILOR #1	Tie it down! Tie it down!
M	FRENCH COOK	Jump! Jump!
F	PI	HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY, HELP ME! HEY! OVER HERE!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Richard Parker?
M	PI (CONT'D)	NO! GO AWAY!
F	PI	Amma! Appa! Ravi! I'm sorry! I'm sorry...! what energy he still has, he weeps - his face is puffy
F	PI	Hari?
M	PI (CONT'D)	Looks as though your drugs haven't worn off yet.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Orange Juice!! This way!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Welcome to Pi's ark!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Where is your boy, Orange Juice? I'll bet Mother and Father found him. They'll all be here soon.
F	PI	HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?
F	PI	No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!
F	PI	I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any seasickness medicine for you -
M	PI (CONT'D)	Supplies! Ah, supplies!
F	PI	YES!
M	PI (CONT'D)	NO!! NO!! NO!! NO!!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Come on! Come on!! COME ON...!!! biscuits are so dry that he is barely able to chew them -
M	PI (WRITING V.O.)	"My name is Pi Patel. I have been in a shipwreck. I am on a lifeboat alone - with a tiger. Please send help."
M	PI (CONT'D)	God... I give myself to you. I am your vessel. Whatever comes... I want to know. Show me.
F	PI	There are no lines!
M	PI (READING - V.O.)	"Set your house in order and dig in for the battle to survive. Establish a strict schedule for eating, keeping watch and getting rest. Do not drink urine or sea water.
M	Keep busy, but avoid unnecessary	exertion. The mind can be kept occupied by playing card games, Twenty Questions, or I Spy. Community singing is another sure- fire way to lift the spirits. Telling stories is highly recommended. Above all, don't lose hope." "Few things can sap the spirit faster than seasickness. Waves are more strongly felt when a boat turns sideways to the current. A sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boat's head to the wind.
M	PI (READING V.O.:) (CONT'D)	Proper use of them can increase control and reduce seasickness during rough seas... For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores it's advisable to establish a territory as your own. The following course of action is recommended. Step one: choose a day when waves are moderate but regular. Step two: with the lifeboat facing into the waves, making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly. Step three: turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves, accompanied by harsh aggressive use of the whistle. With sufficient repetition, the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of seasickness. Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers, though they generally lack access to rough seas.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Let the trumpets blare, let the drum rolls begin! Prepare to be amazed! Here it is, for your enjoyment and instruction, the show you've been waiting for all your life will soon begin! Are you ready for the miracle of it? Well, then - I give to you... ... the ASTOUNDING BENGAL TIGER!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Hello, Richard Parker. Sorry about the choppy ride.
M	PI (CONT'D)	MINE! YOU UNDERSTAND? YOURS - MINE! You understand?
M	PI (READING V.O.) (CONT'D)	Step four: disregard steps one through three.
F	PI	Here, Richard Parker. I've got some water for you. In the zoo, we fed our tigers an average of five kilos of meat a day. Richard Parker will be getting hungry soon.
M	PI (V.O.)	Tigers are powerful swimmers, and, if he gets hungry enough, I'm afraid the little bit of water between us won't be any protection. I need to find a way to feed him. God made tigers carnivores, so I must learn to catch fish. If I don't, I'm afraid his last meal will be a skinny vegetarian boy.
M	A SHORT TIME	LATER -
F	PI	Patience!
F	PI	What am I doing? Wait - I'm thinking. 93 cans of water...
F	PI	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Thank you, Lord Vishnu. Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives. Thank you...
M	PI (V.O.)	Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me to keep them safe. Idiot.
M	PI (V.O. - CONT'D)	Hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Here, it's yours. MINE!!!! MINE!!! AHHH!! AAAAHHHH!!!!
M	PI (V.O.)	I can't risk my life every time I have to climb onto the boat for supplies. It's time to settle this. If we're going to live together, we have to learn to communicate.
M	PI (V.O.)	Maybe Richard Parker cannot be tamed, but with God's will, he can be trained.
F	PI	
M	PI (CONT'D)	Good.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Go Richard Parker. Go. Go on home; I'll leave you alone. I'll respect that. I promise. Go, c'mon.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Yes! I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness. That a pile of tools - a bucket, a knife, a pencil- might become my greatest treasures. Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace. In times like these, I remember that he has as little experience of the real world as I do. We were both raised in a zoo by the same master. Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together. Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now. My fear of him keeps me alert. Tending to his needs gives my life purpose.
F	PI	Dolphins, Richard Parker!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Hey! HEY!! WE'RE HERE!! OVER HERE!!
M	PI (WRITING - V.O.)	Above all, don't lose hope...
F	PI	
F	PI	What are you looking at...? Tell me. What do you see?
M	PI (WRITING - V.O.) (CONT'D)	Words are all I have left to hang onto...
M	PI (WRITING - V.O.)	Everything mixed up, fragmented. Can't tell daydreams, night dreams from reality anym --
F	PI	Storm! Storm, Richard Parker!
F	PI	No!
F	PI	Praise be to God, Lord of All Worlds, the Compassionate, the Merciful!
M	PI (CONT'D)	It's beautiful... Where are you, Richard Parker? You have to see this!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Come out Richard Parker! Come see the hand of God!
M	PI (CONT'D)	Don't hide yourself! He's come to us! It's a miracle! COME OUT AND SEE GOD RICHARD PARKER!
M	PI (CONT'D)	WHY ARE YOU SCARING HIM! I'VE LOST MY FAMILY - I'VE LOST EVERYTHING! I SURRENDER! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
M	PI (CONT'D)	I'm sorry Richard Parker!
F	PI	We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm sorry.
M	PI (CONT'D)	Amma, Appa, Ravi - I'm happy I'm going to see you soon. Can you feel the rain?
M	PI (CONT'D)	God, thank you for giving me my life. I'm ready now.
F	PI	Richard Parker?
F	PI	Excuse me... Go on, move!
F	PI	Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get away. This is my bed!
M	FLASH FORWARD	TO:
M	WRITER	It was human tooth?
M	ADULT PI	Don't you see, the island was carnivorous.
M	WRITER	Carnivorous? Like... a Venus flytrap?
M	ADULT PI	Yes, the whole island - the plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself. During the day, those pools held fresh water, but at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid - acid that dissolved those fish, that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and Richard Parker running to the boat.
M	WRITER	But where did the tooth come from?
M	ADULT PI	Years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.... And like me he thought he might stay there forever. But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night. To think - how many hours spent with only meerkats for company? How much loneliness taken on?
M	ADULT PI (CONT'D)	All I know is that eventually he died, and the island digested him, leaving behind only his teeth. I saw how my life would end if I stayed on that island. Alone and forgotten. I had to go back to the world, or die trying. I spent the next day preparing the boat. I filled my stores with fresh water, ate seaweed until my stomach could take no more, and brought as many meerkats as I could fit into the storage locker for Richard Parker. I couldn't leave without him, of course - it would mean killing him. And so I waited for his return. I knew he wouldn't be late.
F	PI	RICHARD PARKER!
M	PI (V.O)	No one has ever seen that floating island since; you won't read about those trees in any nature book. And yet if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died. And if I hadn't discovered that tooth, I would have been lost, alone forever. Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching. Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering, He was watching. And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest, then gave me a sign to continue my journey.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	By the time we reached the Mexican shore, I was afraid to let go of the boat. My strength was gone. I was so weak. I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance, I would drown. I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand. It was warm and soft, like pressing my face against the cheek of God. And somewhere two eyes were smiling at having me there.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	I was so spent I couldn't move. And so Richard Parker went ahead of me.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	He stretched his legs and walked along the shore.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.)	At the edge of the jungle, he stopped. I was certain he was going to look back at me, flatten his ears to his head, growl - that he'd bring our relationship to an end in some way. But he just stared ahead into the jungle.
M	ADULT PI	And then Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive, disappeared forever from my life.
M	ADULT PI	After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away.
M	ADULT PI (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I wept like a child, not because I was overwhelmed at having survived, although I was. I was weeping because Richard Parker left me so... unceremoniously. It broke my heart.
M	ADULT PI	You know, my father was right. Richard Parker never saw me as his friend. After all we'd been through, he didn't even look back. But I have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know I felt it - even if I can't prove it. I just wish... You know, I've left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India - I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived... And I know he's a tiger, but I wish I'd said: 'It's over. We've survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.'
M	WRITER	I don't know what to say.
M	ADULT PI	Hard to believe, isn't it?
M	WRITER	It is a lot to take in, to figure out what it all means.
M	ADULT PI	If it happened, it happened. Why should it have to mean anything?
M	WRITER	Well, some of it is pretty incredible.
M	ADULT PI	I was the only one who survived the shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering. I still have a copy of their report.
M	ADULT PI (CONT'D)	They had insurance claims to settle, and they wanted to find out why the ship sank. They didn't believe me either.
M	OKAMOTO	Thousands of meerkats? On a floating carnivorous island? And no one has ever seen it?
M	YOUNG PI	Yes. Just like I told you.
M	CHIBA	Bananas don't float.
M	OKAMOTO	Why are you talking about bananas?
M	CHIBA	You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas. But bananas don't float.
M	OKAMOTO	Are you sure about that?
M	YOUNG PI	Of course they do. Try it for yourself.
M	OKAMOTO	In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.
M	YOUNG PI	I've just told you a long story. I'm very tired.
M	OKAMOTO	We're here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific.
M	YOUNG PI	Something I never forget. I lost my whole family.
M	OKAMOTO	Get him some water. We don't mean to push you. And you have our deepest sympathies. But we've come a long way. And we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank.
M	YOUNG PI	Because I don't know. I was asleep. Something woke me up. It may have been an explosion; I can't be sure. And then the ship sank. What else do you want from me?
M	CHIBA (OFF)	A story that won't make us look like fools.
M	OKAMOTO	We need a simpler story for our report. One our company can understand. A story we can all believe.
M	YOUNG PI	So.... a story without things you never seen before.
M	OKAMOTO	That's right.
M	YOUNG PI	Without surprises. Without animals or islands.
M	OKAMOTO	Yes. The truth.
M	WRITER	So what did you do?
M	ADULT PI	I told him another story. Four of us survived... Four of us survived...
M	YOUNG PI	...The cook and the sailor were already onboard. The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard. Mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat. The cook, the cook was a disgusting man. He ate a rat. We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days - and he killed it, and dried it in the sun and ate it. He was such a brute, that man. But he was resourceful. It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish. We would have died in those first few days without him. The sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering. I can still hear him - the happy Buddhist who only ate rice with gravy. He had broken his leg horribly in the fall. We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he'd die. The cook said he'd do it, but mother and I had to hold the man down. And I believed him - we needed to do it. I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm but he just kept.. looking me, his eyes so... I'll never the point of that man's We didn't save him, of He died. The morning after, cook caught his first dorado, I didn't understand what he'd at first, but Mother did, and never seen her so angry. 'Stop and be happy,' he said. "We more food or we'll die. That the whole point.' 'What was the Mother asked. "You let that boy die in order to get bait? monster!' The cook got furious. started towards her with his raised, and Mother slapped hard, right across the face. I stunned. I thought he was going kill her right then. But he The cook didn't stop at either, no. The sailor, he the same way the rat went - cook was a resourceful man. It a week later that he... Because me. Because I couldn't hold onto stupid turtle. It slipped out of hands and swam away and the cook up and punched me on the side the head and my teeth clacked I saw stars. I thought he was to hit me again, but then started pounding on him with fists and screaming, "MONSTER! She yelled at me to go to raft - "Nee poda!" I thought was coming with me or I'd never I don't know why I didn't her go first. I think about every day. I jumped over and back just as the knife came There wasn't anything I could I couldn't look away... He her body overboard. Then the came. I saw what they... I The next day I killed him. He even fight back. He knew he gone too far, even by his He'd left the knife out the bench. And I did to him what did to the sailor. He was such evil man, but worse still, he the evil out in me.
M	YOUNG PI (CONT'D)	I have to live with that. I was alone in a lifeboat, drifting across the Pacific Ocean. And I survived.
M	ADULT PI	After that, no more questions. The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly - but they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left.
M	WRITER	So... the stories... Both the zebra and the sailor broke their leg. And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan. So ... the hyena is the cook. And the sailor is the zebra, mother is the orangutan... and you're... the tiger.
M	ADULT PI	Can I ask you something?
M	WRITER	Of course.
M	ADULT PI	I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean. Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship, and no one can prove which story is true and which is not. In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I suffer.
M	WRITER	True.
M	ADULT PI	So which story do you prefer?
M	WRITER	The story with the tiger. That's the better story.
M	ADULT PI	Thank you. And so it goes with God.
M	WRITER	Mamaji was right. It is an amazing story. Will you really let me write it?
M	ADULT PI	Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all? My wife is here. Would you like to stay for dinner? She's an incredible cook.
M	WRITER	I didn't know you had a wife.
M	ADULT PI	And a cat, and two children.
M	WRITER	So your story does have a happy ending.
M	ADULT PI	Well, that's up to you. The story's yours now.
M	WRITER	"Mr. Patel's is an astounding story of courage and endurance unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks. Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea, and none in the company of... ...an adult Bengal tiger."
F	PI	We have a guest. Let me introduce you...
