M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ERIC (V.0.)	Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
M	ERIC (V.0.)	Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell. BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
M	ERIC (V.0.)	And because the red seemed so alive against the white, she thought, if only I had a child as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and all with the strength of that rose. A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --
M	ERIC (V.O.)	Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named "Snow White." With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
M	ERIC V/O	And she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty.
M	YOUNG SNOW WHITE	Pick it up, William. Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
M	YOUNG WILLIAM	It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
M	YOUNG SNOW WHITE	Hurry, William! Hurry! They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
M	YOUNG SNOW WHITE	We found it in the woods. The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
F	QUEEN	It will heal in time. Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.
M	SNOW WHITE	I'll look after it. The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.
F	QUEEN	You possess a rare beauty, my love. In here. Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need its strength to one day become Queen. He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding. And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
M	KING MAGNUS	My daughter will need your son's friendship more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I yours.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	We are here to serve you, your Majesty.
M	ERIC (V.0)	The next winter was the harshest in memory and Snow White's mother passed away. The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
M	ERIC (V.0)	A year went by but the King was inconsolable. Taking advantage of his grief, dark forces gathered on the kingdom's borders. King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -
M	DUKE HAMMOND	From what hell comes this army?
M	KING MAGNUS	A hell they'll soon revisit! King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of Hand to hand combat at its most brutal. All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors Strange. DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
M	ERIC (V.0.)	The unholy army was defeated, leaving King Magnus with the spoils of victory. A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there. Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.
M	KING MAGNUS	You are now free. You have nothing to fear from me. Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
M	KING MAGNUS	What is your name, my lady? Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
F	RAVENNA	My name is Ravenna, sire. The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.
M	ERIC (V.0.)	So struck by her beauty was the King, that he forgot, for the first time, his broken heart. His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment.
M	RAVENNA'S MOTHER	This - is all that can save you, Ravenna. The young Ravenna looks away, distracted by SHOUTS and A little boy, FINN, runs as fast as he can through the snow Behind him, THE KING'S RIDERS advance on the camp.
M	BACK INSIDE THE WAGON	Ravenna's mother tries to keep her daughter's attention --
M	RAVENNA'S MOTHER	Ravenna! Present day. Still as a statue and even more beautiful as Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King.
M	SNOW WHITE (O.S.)	You're so beautiful... Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White, Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until
F	RAVENNA	That is kind, child. Especially when it is said that yours is the face of true beauty in this kingdom. Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this.
F	RAVENNA	Would you like to be dressed up like this and married one day? Snow White nods.
F	RAVENNA	I hope you'll invite me?
M	YOUNG SNOW WHITE	Of course. Snow White smiles, enchanted by her new friend.
F	RAVENNA	I know it is difficult, child. When I was your age I, too, lost my mother.
M	SNOW WHITE	You did?
F	RAVENNA	Yes. A King tore me from her arms, dressed me in lace and stole my innocence. Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused.
F	RAVENNA	I can never take your mother's place, but I feel that you and I are bound. I feel it here. Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace,
M	KING MAGNUS	Who are you?
F	RAVENNA	The bane of Kings. When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls
F	RAVENNA	Sup, my lord. King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body.
F	RAVENNA	Now you are mine. Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully
F	RAVENNA	I will destroy you. Indeed, you will. She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the
F	RAVENNA	As my people were destroyed. As my family was destroyed. As I would have been destroyed. He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show
F	RAVENNA	But when a woman stays young forever - no man can resist her - and the world is hers.
M	KING MAGNUS	What...?
F	RAVENNA	First I will take your life, my lord. Then I will take your throne. She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna
F	RAVENNA	The King has laid down his sword for the night. Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and Ravenna's mother takes Ravenna's hand and holds it over a
M	RAVENNA'S MOTHER	You must trust me, my love. With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of
M	FINN	They're coming! The King's men!
F	RAVENNA	Drink! Ravenna chokes it down.
M	RAVENNA'S MOTHER	Drink! And with it the ability to steal youth and beauty! For that is your ultimate power and only protection. Finn steps forward.
M	FINN	I will protect my sister! Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead,
M	FINN	So it shall be, Finn.
F	RAVENNA	Welcome, brother. The Duke rides under the portcullis with William. His bodyguard
M	YOUNG WILLIAM	Father! The Princess! But the portcullis is down, separating Snow White and William.
F	RAVENNA	Mirror, mirror, on the wall Who is the fairest of them all? There'.s a brief silence, then the surface of the mirror ripples.
M	MIRROR MAN	it is you, my Queen! Yet another kingdom falls to your glory! Is there no end to your power and beauty? Ravenna smiles, moves to the center of the room, raises her arms SCREAMS! The scream becomes --
M	RAVENNA'S MOTHER	But be warned Ravenna: By fairest blood it is done and only by fairest blood can it be undone. Ravenna looks back to see her mother and other gypsies put to Finn struggles free and chases after the King's men as they All the wedding guests and nobles stand, held there by guards Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs.
F	RAVENNA	So kind of you all to stay over.
M	GENERAL	What shall we do with these? She eyes the noblemen and guests from left to right. Their There is none.
F	RAVENNA	To the sword. There are GASPS and SCREAMS as the Guards move the guests Ravenna notices Finn, off to one side, his dagger at the neck
F	RAVENNA	Finn! Finn stops his exit with Snow White, and turns. Ravenna
F	RAVENNA	Lock her away. One never knows when royal blood may be of value.
M	ERIC (V.0.)	The spell Ravenna's mother placed on her gave her the ability to steal youth and beauty, and indeed all things good, for her own evil purposes. But for every life there must be a death, for every gain, loss, and under the reign of Ravenna nature turned on itself and people turned on each other.
M	ERIC V/O	And all this time, she kept Snow White in a cell in the north tower. Ravenna, in the shadows, sits perfectly still. Though it's Around the corner, Finn secretly eyes his sister, who doesn't Ravenna, just outside the cell, doesn't blink, entranced by Snow White opens her eyes and sees Ravenna. This is not the
M	SNOW WHITE	Why?... Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away. It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her Help!!!! He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a
M	ERIC	Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!
M	BROCH	Ale given you courage again, huntsman?
M	ERIC	Won't take much courage to split your skull from here.
M	BROCH	Aye, but first you'd have to see straight. Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe. Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now
M	ROSE	Thank you. Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her
M	ROSE	I don't know how to repay you? Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and
M	ERIC	Don't worry, somebody else will.
M	SLAVE MERCHANT	Her nose is on the large size and her chin's a little weak.
M	ERIC	Your eyes are dim.
M	SLAVE MERCHANT	I'll give you two gold pieces.
M	ERIC	After all the business we've done together? Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.
M	SLAVE MERCHANT	Four gold pieces and that's my final offer! Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.
M	ERIC	I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank you. The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:
M	SLAVE MERCHANT	Ten gold pieces! Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
M	SNOW WHITE	Hello?... What's your name? Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and
M	ROSE	I am Rose. Snow White smiles - a friendly face. The General uses a pointer to make his presentation while
M	BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL	There are scattered rebel groups on the fringe of the dark forest, but they cause little harm. She dips her fingers into a bowl of DEAD SONGBIRDS, plucks
F	RAVENNA	And what of the Duke?
M	BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL	We have pushed his forces into the mountains but his stronghold at Carmath holds firm.
F	RAVENNA	Lay siege to it.
M	ANOTHER GENERAL	The mountains and fortress provide impenetrable protection, my Queen.
F	RAVENNA	Then lure him out! Burn every village that supports him. Poison their wells. If they still resist put their heads on pikes to decorate the roads!
M	BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL	My Queen. They have taken the fight to us. Rebels harry our supply lines and rob our pay wagons.
M	ANOTHER GENERAL	We have just captured two of the rebel leaders. They will be put to the sword.
F	RAVENNA	I wish to interrogate them myself. She drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath. She She is dressed now and stands at a window, Finn at her side. I won't go back. She is lost for a moment, then...
F	RAVENNA	Finn, do you remember when we were children, begging for scraps like those wretches?
M	FINN	Yes, my Queen.
F	RAVENNA	Am I not kinder?
M	ROSE	All the girls in our village were taken. I was trying to reach safe haven at Duke Hammond's castle when I was caught -- Snow White bursts with hope --
M	SNOW WHITE	The Duke?! He's alive?! He still fights in my father's name?! Rose stares at the feral girl now, realizing who she is.
M	ROSE	You're the king's daughter? Princess?... The night the evil one's reign began we were told all in the castle were put to the sword. How were you spared?
M	SNOW WHITE	William? What about William?! The Duke's son?! Is he alive?!
M	ROSE	I don't know, princess. Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears
M	ROSE	Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward.
M	SOLDIER	My Queen, these two were captured leading an ambush of our supply caravan. Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them.
F	RAVENNA	You left your home, your family, the bosom of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why?
M	THOMAS	Because under your rule we have lost everything. We will not stop until this kingdom is free.
F	RAVENNA	Lost everything? Your son? She moves to Iain, right up to his face.
F	RAVENNA	Very handsome. Obviously a debt owed to your wife. She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles
F	RAVENNA	There was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours -- and you would have no doubt broken mine. In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into
F	RAVENNA	You would kill your Queen? She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and
F	RAVENNA	You have beauty. And courage. But how strong is your heart? She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his
F	RAVENNA	No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his Queen. With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that
M	FINN	Are you alright? Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the
M	OUT!!!!!	They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as
M	FINN	Magic comes at a lofty price.
F	RAVENNA	And the expense grows.
M	FINN	You look...
F	RAVENNA	old?...
M	FINN	Tired.
F	RAVENNA	My powers... fade. This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches
M	FINN (O.S.)	I have something for what ails you. She turns to see -- Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles.
M	SNOW WHITE	Rose?... The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away.
M	SNOW WHITE	Rose?...
F	RAVENNA	Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who is the fairest of them all? The bronze ripples. The Mirror Man pours out and reforms.
M	MIRROR MAN	My Queen, you have defied nature and robbed it of its fairest fruit. But on this day there is one more beautiful than you.
F	RAVENNA	More beautiful, but --
M	MIRROR MAN	She is the reason your powers wane.
F	RAVENNA	She won't live to see tomorrow. Who is it?! Give me her name?!
M	MIRROR MAN	Snow White. Ravenna is shocked by this, staggers a bit.
F	RAVENNA	Snow White? Finn'.'. I should have killed her as a child. She is my undoing?
M	MIRROR MAN	She is also your treasure, Queen. It was wise to have kept her close for the innocence and purity that can destroy can also heal. Hold her heart in your hands and you shall never again need to consume youth. You shall never again weaken or age. Immortality without cost! Ravenna laughs, overjoyed. Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister
M	FINN	Yes, Queen?... She is confused but notices -- A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover. She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when -- Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall. she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as -- She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
M	FINN	Did I wake you? Snow White shakes her head gently.
M	FINN	Are you always awake when I watch you? Yes. She looks away.
M	SNOW WHITE	You've never come in before.
M	FINN	My Queen won't allow it. She wants you all to herself.
M	SNOW WHITE	I'm afraid of her.
M	FINN	Not of me.
M	SNOW WHITE	No. He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm.
M	FINN	It's alright, princess. You will never again be locked in a cell.
M	SNOW WHITE	What does she want from me? His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it
M	FINN	Your beating heart. Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies.
M	ROSE	Go. Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face. Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away. The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
M	CHIEF GUARD 0/S	Open the gates! The Princess has escaped! He stares in surprise as riders gallop out. A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry, Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear. The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
F	RAVENNA	How is it an innocent young girl makes a fool of my brother?! Armed only with a nail?! If she'd had a sword she'd have taken the whole castle! We're in front of her, behind her, on her face, on her feet --
F	RAVENNA	You swore to protect me! Do you not understand what, the girl means to us?! This is my future! This is everything. Everything!
M	RAVENNA (CONT'D)	There is no one I can trust in this place!! There is no loyalty! None!!!! And then she stops on a dime, turns to him, marches right up to BELTS HIM! Hard. He staggers a bit then picks himself up,
M	FINN	She was chased into the dark forest. She's likely already dead. She SCREAMS and slaps him viciously.
F	RAVENNA	She's no good to me there, lost. I must have her heart! You have failed me! Finn's had enough, he erupts at her --
M	FINN	Have I not given all to you?! She takes this, softens, unexpectedly, and almost smiles.
F	RAVENNA	Have I not given you all? All. She raises her finger and touches his face. His wound heals
M	FINN	Indeed, my Queen.
F	RAVENNA	Don't fail me again, Finn. I have no powers in the Dark Forest. Bring me someone who knows it well. Someone who can hunt her!
M	FINN	The Queen demands the services of someone to navigate the Dark Forest. The villagers stay mum, shaking their heads.
M	OLD LADY	No-one goes into the Dark Forest.
M	FINN	You will be compensated. Still no takers. An OLD-TIMER stares right at FINN, steps
M	OLD-TIMER	There's one man. A widower.
M	FINN	Where might I find him.
M	OLD-TIMER	In the Inn. Drinking. THE SOUND OF SMASHING WOOD. They turn to see --
M	OLD-TIMER	Appears he's finished.
M	BROCH	You owe me money from my pocket and money for the girl!
M	ERIC	I have it right here in my pocket. If you'll just help me up. Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When
M	BROCH	I want my money!
M	ERIC	Actually, I seem to have drunk it all. You're welcome to it when it comes out again. Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight. Hands lift him and -- Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few Perfume? He opens his eyes to see Finn gazing down at him.
M	ERIC	Royalty. That explains it.
M	FINN	The Queen demands your presence.
M	ERIC	Can't you see I'm having a bath?
F	RAVENNA	My brother tells me you are a widower, a drunkard and one of few who has ventured into the dark forest. Finn looks on, standing nearby.
F	RAVENNA	One of my prisoners has escaped there.
M	ERIC	Then he's dead -
F	RAVENNA	She. She shoots Finn a pointed look then looks back at Eric.
M	ERIC	Then she is certainly dead.
F	RAVENNA	Find her. Bring her to me. Eric holds her gaze, uneasy at the request.
M	ERIC	I've been to the Dark Forest enough times to know I'm not going back.
F	RAVENNA	You will be rewarded handsomely.
M	ERIC	Coin's no good to me if I'm lying dead with crows picking at my eyes. Ravenna steps off her throne now, approaching him.
F	RAVENNA	There may be more than gold in the offing.
M	ERIC	Why is her life of such value?
F	RAVENNA	That is none of your concern.
M	ERIC	I'll determine what concerns me, thank you. She smiles, moves even closer to him.
F	RAVENNA	You will do this for me, Huntsman.
M	ERIC	And if I refuse? Ravenna nods to the Guards, who pull their swords. Dying to
M	ERIC	Do me the favor. I beg of you.
F	RAVENNA	So you wish to be reunited with your beloved? Eric reacts instinctively, grabbing her by the throat. The
M	ERIC	My wife is none of your concern. Something about her face, the fact that she enjoys his hand
F	RAVENNA	My condolences. Ravenna holds his gaze.
F	RAVENNA	You miss her? His eyes say, yes, he misses her horribly.
F	RAVENNA	What would you give to bring her back? Eric stares at her curiously.
F	RAVENNA	You know of my powers. Bring me the girl and I will bring back your wife.
M	ERIC	Nothing will bring her back. Ravenna moves even closer, looks him right in the eye. She
F	RAVENNA	I can. Believe me, huntsman. Eric's eyes say he wants to believe. Needs to believe.
F	RAVENNA	A life for a life.
M	FINN	You fought in the west? Against the armies of the five kings? Eric nods without looking at him, gazing at the forest.
M	FINN	You must have seen a great deal of death?
M	ERIC	Death is everywhere.
M	FINN	Come now, you're being modest. There is a difference between gutting a deer and gutting a man. How many did you kill?
M	ERIC	It's not something I counted.
M	FINN	Nor I. But I recall every face. There is no greater delight than battle. Eric finds this unseemly, but prefers not to engage.
M	FINN	Come now, huntsman, what do you feel when you watch a man die? Delight? Invincibility? Sorrow. This takes Finn aback, not an answer he was expecting. After
M	FINN	And what of them? At the tip of your sword. What do they feel? I'd enjoy knowing. Eric looks at him, realizing from Finn's face that it is an
M	FINN	The.only difference between you and I is I'-never found a wife to save my soul.
M	ERIC	Too bad. You'll need one. He stops his horse and nods. They are all stopped at the entrance to the Dark Forest fifty Even the horses sense danger and start to whinny and back up. WE PULL UP, UP, UP until we can see the full scope of the
M	ERIC	Do exactly as I do. Eric carefully places one foot after the next on grassy stepping Once they're across the bog and onto dry land Finn takes a
M	ERIC	Exactly as I do. Eric puts a cloth to his face, gesturing for Finn and his guards Eric stops, bends down, spotting faint FOOTPRINTS in the dew. He 64aEXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 64a Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees.
M	ERIC	Pay them no mind. One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of Only Finn looks unconcerned. Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand. They reluctantly follow Eric. His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit,
M	SNOW WHITE	Let me go! She bites him. He grimaces and grabs her tighter and starts
M	SNOW WHITE	She's going to kill me! The Oueen! He ignores, keeps moving.
M	ERIC	Sure she is.
M	SNOW WHITE	Believe me! Her brother tried to cut out my heart. He stops, looks at her.
M	SNOW WHITE	I swear it. He somehow believes her. New game. Then...
M	FINN (O.S.)	Quick work! Eric looks up to see Finn and his men approaching. Snow White
M	SNOW WHITE	Him! He's the one! He came at me with a knife! Eric holds her tight, one arm around her neck.
M	FINN	Well done, huntsman. Hand her over.
M	SNOW WHITE	You can't trust him!
M	ERIC	What do you intend to do with her?
M	FINN	Why do you care? Finn nods and the Guards approach. Eric grips her tighter. You want her. Give me what I was promised.
M	FINN	Come now huntsman, you did your job well. Keep your word and hand her over.
M	SNOW WHITE	He'll betray you -
M	ERIC	Shut up! -
M	SNOW WHITE	He'll kill us both -
M	ERIC	I said, shut up! He puts his knife to her throat to quiet her. I'll keep my word when the Queen keeps hers. Finn shakes his head and laughs.
M	FINN	You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has many powers; she can take life or sustain it. But she can't bring your wife back from the dead. His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe. Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts Finn pulls his own sword and approaches. They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn Eric grunts and falls back. Finn races forward to finish him Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms. Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a
M	FINN	Butcher him! Find her! The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward. Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant, Eric. He slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream
M	FINN	This is not finished! The words echo through the dark forest.
M	SNOW WHITE	Get your hands off me. She draws his dagger. He backs off. Eyeball to eyeball:
M	SNOW WHITE	Get away.
M	ERIC	Who are you? What the hell's going on?
M	SNOW WHITE	Get away from me.
M	ERIC	Why does the Queen want you dead?
M	SNOW WHITE	She wants us all dead. All of us-
M	ERIC	Then what makes you so damn valuable?
M	SNOW WHITE	You should know. You're the one hunting me. He backs away. Paces. Never get involved in the Queen's business and what do I do? Get involved in the Queen's business... Without warning, he walks off. Leaving her alone. She follows him.
M	SNOW WHITE	Where are you going?
M	ERIC	Away from you, love. You're trouble.
M	SNOW WHITE	I need to get to the Duke's Castle. There's an army there. I'll be safe.
M	ERIC	The Duke? I've seen sheep with more fight in them. Desperate, she takes a chance.
M	SNOW WHITE	Take me, you'll be rewarded. I'm valuable. Isn't that why you're here?
M	SNOW WHITE	You're dead if you return without me. And I'm dead if you leave me. He turns, exasperated with her.
M	ERIC	Just for argument's sake. How much?
M	SNOW WHITE	How much is enough? Eric "reluctantly" prices up the job.
M	ERIC	Well,it's a long way, through the forest, and that... that's a dangerous road, I couldn't even consider it for less than thirty gold pieces...
M	SNOW WHITE	A hundred. Deliver me safe to the Duke. I give you my word. Deep quandary. Still suspicious..
M	ERIC	Who are you? She looks at him levelly.
M	SNOW WHITE	Maybe that's a question you should have asked the queen. Stand-off.
M	SNOW WHITE	Do we have a deal?
M	ERIC	I don't trust you Billy Goat.
M	SNOW WHITE	I've given you my word. He spits on his hand. She puts out her hand.
M	ERIC	I still don't trust you.
M	SNOW WHITE	I don't trust you either. She wipes it on her skirt. Behind them, a commotion. Tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light. The mist He sits on a log for a breath.
M	ERIC	We'll stay the night here.
M	SNOW WHITE	You haven't answered me.
M	ERIC	I don't recall a question.
M	SNOW WHITE	Where are we going? He takes a stick, draws in the dirt.
M	ERIC	Queen. Mountains. Dark Forest. Here. Past. There's a village. She takes the stick, points to a different spot in the dirt.
M	SNOW WHITE	I'm going to the Duke's Castle. He grabs the stick back.
M	ERIC	You'll go where I take you.
M	SNOW WHITE	You'll take me to the Duke's castle or I'll go alone. As soon as you get me out of the forest.
M	ERIC	You're rather demanding, and not all that endearing, you know?
M	SNOW WHITE	There's a reward that awaits you. There are noblemen there, an army. An army? The Duke fights? He hides behind walls. I know sheep that have more fight in them. How much? Reward? Just for argument's sake?
M	SNOW WHITE	How much do you want? Eric considers this, not sure how or if to negotiate.
M	SNOW WHITE	Two hundred gold pieces. Do we have a deal? More, a lot more, than he was expecting.
M	ERIC	I'll deliver you to safety m' lady.
M	SNOW WHITE	Swear it.
M	ERIC	I swear (beat). Constantly. It's one of my better qualities. She's not sure what to make of this, but...
M	SNOW WHITE	Fine. He moves to a spot to lie down and gathers leaves.
M	ERIC	I've seen far stranger things in here. She sits, looks to Eric. Something's been bothering her.
M	SNOW WHITE	Do you think... will they follow us?
M	ERIC	They'd be foolish to. Few survive. Good news/bad news. She looks around.
M	SNOW WHITE	How far have you travelled into the Dark Forest?
M	ERIC	We passed it a few miles back. He opens his flask and takes a healthy pull.
M	THOMAS	She killed brave Lain with only her palm and pulled a dagger from her chest without blood. She cannot be killed. Duke Hammond has heard enough, turns to leave.
M	THOMAS	There is more. The princess has escaped the castle! Where is my son? William, rapid-fires his bow at close quarters into a line of
M	WILLIAM	You asked for me, father? 73a CONTINUED: 73a
M	DUKE HAMMOND	I have news of the Princess. William stares in surprise --
M	WILLIAM	The Princess?!!
M	DUKE HAMMOND	Ravenna has kept her all these years.
M	WILLIAM	She lives?!
M	DUKE HAMMOND	She escaped the castle and into the dark He turns to leave --
M	WILLIAM	I'm going after her!.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	We don't know if she survived -- Duke Hammond grabs him by the arm.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	You ventured beyond the walls tonight, disobeying my orders. We are all that's left, William. I cannot afford to lose any more of my men.
M	WILLIAM	Then I will go alone.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	And I cannot afford to lose my only heir! You do not know the dark forest!
M	WILLIAM	Then I'll find someone who does. William pulls away.
M	WILLIAM	I will not abandon her a second time. 75 MOVED TO 68a 75
M	FINN	Which of you knows the dark forest? A powerfully built Yakut tracker, ALDAN, and BROCH both nod.
M	FINN	You. You. You. You. He's selected Aldan, Broch and points to others. As we move William, hat low, trying to look tough.
M	FINN	Load and prepare. You ride for bounty. Into the dark forest. The rest of you. Away ! As they disperse.. William sets his jaw, and heads off.. The men ride out of the village. Suddenly they stop.
M	WILLIAM	You need a bowman? FINN calls back.
M	FINN	I have a bowman. Away. WILLIAM stands unblinking.
M	FINN	I said away, damn you! WILLIAM doesn't move. Finn turns to the bowman.
M	FINN	Kill him. The bowman smiles, draws his bow. BEFORE he can loose an arrow:
M	THWACK! THWACK!!	Two arrows strike the bowman in the throat, lifting him off FINN turns. WILLIAM lowers his bow.
M	WILLIAM	I said do you need a bowman? Finn studies William with dead eyes. 80aEXT. VILLAGE ROAD - DAY. 80a In the pouring rain, a group of fierce BOUNTY HUNTERS ride on
M	BROCH	Clear the road. But William doesn't budge. One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards
M	FINN	Wait! Finn sizes up William.
M	FINN	You're quick with a bow.
M	WILLIAM	I want to ride with you.
M	FINN	Why?
M	WILLIAM	You are paying well and I need the coin.
M	FINN	Have you traversed the Dark Forest?
M	WILLIAM	No.
M	FINN	Then what use are you?
M	WILLIAM	As you said, I'm quick with a bow. He nods to the guy on the ground, groaning with arrows in his
M	WILLIAM	And unlike him, I have two good legs. Finn considers for a moment, then smiles, nods to the guy on
M	FINN	Replace him. William looks at Finn gratefully. Finn studies him with a Snow White approaches a stream, kneels, splashes her face and
M	ERIC	I wouldn't do that if I were you. Not unless you want your bowels to rip apart. She turns. Eric has been snoozing on a rock, with one eye
M	SNOW WHITE	What is it?
M	ERIC	A fumee.
M	SNOW WHITE	A what?
M	ERIC	You want me to call it by another name? He doesn't need to. It's an animal dropping. Snow White winces She catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the
M	ERIC	Stay here. He moves away, though the trees, tracking prey. He hears the
F	SARA	Eric. He stops, looks to -- An outcropping of rocks, surrounded by dense forest. From
M	ERIC	Sara?...
M	BACK TO SNOW WHITE	She hears him call out and follows his tracks.
M	BACK TO HUNTSMAN	Sara holds out her hand.
M	ERIC	Am I dreaming?
F	SARA	Touch me and see for yourself. Eric shakes his head, looks around, tries to fight it, but...
F	SARA	You weren't there to save me, Eric. I called for you but you never came. Snow White appears behind and sees -- But Eric only sees Sara and he continues to move toward her.
F	SARA	Where were you, Eric? Come to me now. Protect me now.
M	ERIC	Sara, I'm so sorry. Forgive me, please forgive me. Give me peace. Sara... He takes another step toward her and -- Buckles - THWACK! Snow White hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood.
M	SNOW WHITE	She's not real! Not real! Do you hear me?! He does and calms. She gets off him and he sits up, fatigued He reaches for his flask -- pours the last single drop into Snow White catches up.
M	SNOW WHITE	Who is she? The one you bargained for. The one that spoke to you. Who is Sara?
M	ERIC	A name you'll not mention again. He tosses a knife to her. She's surprised but catches it.
M	SNOW WHITE	What?
M	ERIC	Feel its weight. One hand to the other. She shakes her head but does so.
M	ERIC	Now hold it - business end pointed at me.
M	SNOW WHITE	Why are you?-- He lunges at her and she raises the blade.
M	ERIC	Which is your lead foot?
M	SNOW WHITE	What do you mean? He jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward,
M	ERIC	Now stay back. You're too small to attack. You have to parry; use your opponents strength against him. Raise your opposing forearm. She does. He comes closer.
M	ERIC	With it you block and deflect an opposing thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't die from it. Wait until I'm close. He steps forward.
M	ERIC	Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes. He moves even closer.
M	ERIC	Not yet. Not until you can feel my breath. He moves right up to her.
M	ERIC	Now. Their faces are inches apart.
M	ERIC	This close. Drive it through me. To the hilt. Now look in my eyes. Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul. Their eyes are still locked.
M	SNOW WHITE	Why do I need to learn how to kill? He looks at her.
M	ERIC	There's a lot you need to learn lass. Eric backs away.
M	ERIC	Keep that. She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an
M	SNOW WHITE	Where are you going?
M	ERIC	Fumee. Her look is one of conviction.
F	RAVENNA	Find her. William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.
M	SNOW WHITE	What is it?
M	ERIC	It can't be this easy. He quietly unsheathes a hatchet.
M	SNOW WHITE	Is this the end of the Dark Forest?
M	ERIC	Uh-huh.
M	SNOW WHITE	How far to the Duke's castle? He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge. Snow White turns to see -- A HUGE CREATURE REARING UP --
M	ERIC	Troll! Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
M	ERIC	Run! Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE! She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE. 87a CONTINUED: (2) 87a Eric stares in surprise, watching the twenty foot monster 87a CONTINUED: (3) 87a Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
M	ERIC	I told you to run.
M	SNOW WHITE	If I had you'd be dead. A "thank you" would suffice. It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back
M	ERIC	Thank you. GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
F	ANNA	They say only demons or spirits can survive the dark forest. Which are you? Eric, unsure, pulls his hatchet and steps in front of Snow
M	ERIC	Which are you?
F	ANNA	Neither. Perhaps you are the Queen's spies?
M	ERIC	We're fugitives from the Queen. Snow White steps forward into the light.
M	SNOW WHITE	We mean you no harm. Anna sees Snow White clearly now, raises her hood. Snow
M	ERIC	Where are the men?
F	ANNA	Gone. Anna paddles a boat as they approach the village. Eric and
M	ON THE BANK	The boat stops and they get out. The women of the village More women emerge from their huts to view the newcomers, no All the women have assembled alongside the group, watching
M	SNOW WHITE	Why are they looking at me like that?
M	ERIC	I don't know, but keep smiling. A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends 90-93a OMITTED 90-93a
F	ANNA	You have travelled far Huntsman. With a heavy burden. Snow white is playing with Lily. They are making little dolls
M	ERIC	I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's not that heavy.
F	ANNA	You mean... you do not know who she is? His eyes narrow.
M	ERIC	What do you mean? He looks over.
M	ERIC	Who is she?
M	ACROSS THE WAY	Snow White draws eyes upon the doll. Snow White's eyes fill with tears.
F	LILY	My father showed me how to make them. But he's gone away. Lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar..
F	LILY	Here. She's finished. She hands it to her. 93b CONTINUED: (2) 93b
M	SNOW WHITE	She's beautiful. Lily smiles and runs off to play. Behind her Eric appears.
M	SNOW WHITE	These women... This place.. It's very peaceful. But it makes me very sad.
M	ERIC	Why didn't you tell me? She stops. She knows.
M	ERIC	Because I'd think it too fell a task? You'd be right. She looks at him. Shakes her head.
M	SNOW WHITE	That's not why. It's because I've never said the words. She looks at Lily playing.
M	SNOW WHITE	I'm not sure I believe it myself. I never felt like a.. Alone in a dark cell. For years. Fighting to cling to memories. What he looked like. Smelled like. The kind man with the big arms and the wonderful smiles.. To me.. he wasn't The King. He was my father. Eric doesn't know what to say. In time, he reaches in his
M	ERIC	Here.
M	SNOW WHITE	What is it?
M	ERIC	I've carried it a long time.
M	SNOW WHITE	What is it made of?
M	ERIC	Gristle from a stag's heart.
M	ERIC (CONT'D)	The stag's the most timid animal in the forest but there's a bone in it's heart that gives it courage in it's hour of need and makes it the bravest in of all God's creatures. It's a protection charm. Or so they say. They share a look.
M	SNOW WHITE	Was it hers? It's the most honest and emotional he's been with her.
M	ERIC	Take it. She does.
M	SNOW WHITE	Thank you, huntsman. He looks at the sky.
M	ERIC	It's getting dark. He walks away.
M	SNOW WHITE	She's so beautiful.
F	ANNA	That is not a kind thing to say in these times. Youth one cannot alter... beauty, however. We have sacrificed beauty to raise our children in peace. And you, your sacrifice will come, princess. Snow White looks to Anna, surprised. Eric exits and pauses, looks back - through the flap can see
F	ANNA	You must prepare yourself, my dear. For a time soon comes when you must deliver that sacrifice. Will you be ready? Anna suddenly stops. As if something has disturbed her. She
M	SNOW WHITE	What is it?
F	ANNA	Sleep my dear. You must rest. She leaves. Eric makes his way along the perimeter, finding a path Twenty feet away. It's Anna.
F	ANNA	How can you desert her now you know the truth?
M	ERIC	Aye I know the truth. And that's exactly why she should be as far from me as possible.
F	ANNA	She's the only one that can save us. She needs you.
M	ERIC	Trust me. I'm the last thing she needs. I'm bad luck. Everything I've ever cared about was destroyed.
F	ANNA	There's good in you Huntsman. I can see it.
M	ERIC	People have made that mistake before. He heads off into the night. A MERCENARY races into the hut.
M	FINN	Run, rats, run. Find her! William looks around the burning village in panic. Run! Snow White faces off with the Mercenary. She does as she's been
M	FACE TO FACE	With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a She stands perfectly still.
M	SUDDENLY	Anna pulls Snow White away, as they move through the smoke William starts to follow, a curtain of smoke swirling around
M	ERIC	Come on!
M	SNOW WHITE	We must help them! Anna sees Snow White fighting off Eric and shouts --
F	ANNA	You will! Go! Eric holds her firmly, pulling her away against her will.
M	FINN	Have you seen her?
M	WILLIAM	No, my lord. Finn spits fury and continues to race around, frantic.
F	RAVENNA	What did you say? Then she's right in her face -- The "old woman" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted RAVENNA The word echoes in the palace --
M	SNOW WHITE	Why did you come back?
M	ERIC	I led them there. I am to blame. Snow White looks at him with empathy. He's in pain, too.
M	ERIC	I will take you to Duke Hammond's. Snow White slowly nods. Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their The dwarf leader, Beith glowers.
F	BEITH	Well, well, well... the miscreant huntsman.
M	ERIC	Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a friend? The dwarf leader, BEITH, glowers.
F	BEITH	No, you horn beast, this is how I treat a friend! He smacks Eric with a gnarled stick. Snow White and the huntsman are still trussed up like chickens What did you do to them?
M	ERIC	I tried to collect the bounty on their heads. A few times.
M	SNOW WHITE	Is there no one you haven't wronged? Eric nods at her. "You."
M	ERIC	But there's always tomorrow.
M	GORT	Shut it, you hedge pig. The Dwarf confab breaks up and they approach.
F	BEITH	This is my lucky day, the puttock I loathe most in the world lands in my lap.
M	ERIC	It is your lucky day, Beith. I've got enough gold to keep you in ale for a year. Cut me down and I'll -- NION, Beith's right hand man and a fervent dwarf supremacist,
M	NION	Shut your ugly mug, huntsman. You had any pennies they would have fallen out your pockets by now.
M	ERIC	It's hidden. Back there, in the woods. A short distance. They get the reference, don't like it. Nion slaps Eric again.
M	NION	Pull the other one, you lying dangler.
M	SNOW WHITE	Tell them the truth, huntsman. The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with What are you looking at? 124a CONTINUED: (2) 124a
M	GUS	Nothing, Miss. It's just... you been the prettiest thing I ever did seen. He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at
M	ERIC	Just tell me what I've done wrong?
F	BEITH	Tell me what you've done right first?
M	ERIC	I saved this girl from the Queen. Out of the goodness of my heart. Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his
F	BEITH	Doesn't sound like you, huntsman.
M	ERIC	People change.
M	NION	People, not ruttish swine. Nion gives Eric another smack around the head.
F	MUIR	Quert? Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to
M	GORT	So what's the verdict?
M	COLL	Leave 'em to rot.
M	DUIR	Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot!
M	COLL	That would work, too, but my way's cleaner. Note: Coll and Duir have this "at each other but we're
F	MUIR	No! She is destined. They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the
M	GORT	Destined?... She is.
F	BEITH	Are you?
M	SNOW WHITE	Do you hate the Queen?
F	BEITH	Hate's a strong word. But not strong enough in this case.
M	SNOW WHITE	My father was King Magnus. This carries weight with the group. Impressed.
F	MUIR	No one listens to me.
M	SNOW WHITE	If you accompany us to the Duke's castle you will be paid handsomely.
M	ERIC	We don't need their help.
F	BEITH	You were already lost seeing that you found us.
M	GORT	How handsomely?
M	SNOW WHITE	Your weight in gold. Each of you. The dwarves trade glances, literally sizing each other up.
M	ERIC	That's more than you offered me?!
F	BEITH	Goodness of your heart, eh, Huntsman?
M	DUIR	I get more than you.
M	COLL	True, but because of your size you eat and drink more, which costs more, so...
F	BEITH	Alright, we'll take you, but the huntsman can hang -
M	SNOW WHITE	Both of us. Eric looks surprised by her loyalty. So do the dwarves.
M	DUIR	Riders! The dwarves look round to see a DOZEN SILHOUETTED HORSEMEN
M	ERIC	Those are the Queen's men, Beith, better decide quickly.
F	BEITH	One dwarf's worth a dozen tallsters, I'll take my time thank you -- He suddenly stops as dozens more RIDERS appear on the hill.
M	ERIC	You were saying?
F	BEITH	Cut him down! MOVE OUT! Nion roughly cuts the line and the Huntsman drops to the
M	ERIC	Ah, a short cut. All 8 dwarf heads spin at him - pissed off. Enough with the Nion raps Eric's knee with the flat of his dagger.
M	ERIC	Owww!!! Gus cuts Snow White loose. Nion hesitates, then reluctantly frees the huntsman. DUIR and
M	NION	Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to stuff my ears.
M	GORT	There's plenty of moss. GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
M	SNOW WHITE	What is this place? The huntsman looks just as dazzled.
M	GUS	They call it Sanctuary, my lady. The Enchanted Forest. It's the home of the fairies. And slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest -- Snow White sees tiny figures flying behind the trees -- almost
M	GUS	Fairies.
M	GORT	Pests. Of the other dwarves, only the blind MUIR seems to appreciate
F	BEITH	set up camp.
M	COLL	That song takes me back to the battle of Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army.
M	DUIR	Them were the days. What happened to your quailing cough? Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join
M	GORT	Play louder, you whey-face, I can still hear those harpy fairies. He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of
M	ERIC	Legend has it dwarves were created to uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not just gold and precious stones, but the beauty in people's hearts.
M	SNOW WHITE	Really?
M	ERIC	Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever had it. When the Queen seized their mines she stole their treasure but more than that she stole their pride. And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask
M	GORT	What are you pribbling at, longshanks?!
M	ERIC	Nothing half-wit.
M	GORT	I'm half of nothing.you canker blossom.
F	MUIR	Son?... Sing the one. Perched on his stone, QUERT nods; sings a more CHEERFUL SONG.
F	MUIR	That seat's not taken, if that's what you were about to ask. She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her.
M	SNOW WHITE	Thank you so much, sir.
F	MUIR	It's only a log, no need to praise me.
M	SNOW WHITE	No. For before. For defending me.
F	MUIR	Your father was a good man. The kingdom prospered. Our people prospered.
M	SNOW WHITE	There were more of you?
F	MUIR	Aye. And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in.
M	GORT	One day the group you see before you went down into the mine for a month long shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came back to the surface... nothing. The land was black, everything, everyone... dead, gone. We searched but... Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out.
F	MUIR	That was the month your father died.
M	SNOW WHITE	I'm so sorry.
F	MUIR	As am I, princess. As am I. GUS walks over to Snow White.
M	GUS	I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss, but would you care to dance-with a little 'un?
M	SNOW WHITE	I'd be honored. Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up. Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus. Nion's not
M	NION	I don't trust her. And I don't believe in her, no matter what Muir says. Gort is still melancholy...
M	GORT	Just you and me,... do you think there are any of us left? Do you think perhaps they were merely banished?
M	NION	As long as the Queen's in charge we'll never know.
M	GORT	Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it? I feel funny. Queer almost.
M	NION	Queer. Since when?
M	GORT	How's your gout? Nion rubs his leg.
M	NION	Better. Gort's look goes from Nion to Snow White.
M	GORT	You don't think it has anything to do with...
M	NION	How much have you had to drink?! The huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when BEITH
F	BEITH	Fleecing us of all our rum, eh huntsman?
M	ERIC	What do you say, we let bygones be bygones?
F	BEITH	Not yet, nut-hook. What's in it for you? I'm talking about the girl? Is it really just the gold? Eric watches Snow White dancing with Gus, then shrugs.
M	ERIC	I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd have abandoned her long ago. Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance.
F	BEITH	Muir says she's destined. Question is, huntsman, for whom? Gus and Snow White are still dancing.
M	GUS	You don't mind me saying, you got two left feet for a princess.
M	SNOW WHITE	I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced in a long, long while. She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her
M	SNOW WHITE	Do you mind, Gus?
M	GUS	Not at all. Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand.
M	SNOW WHITE	You've taught me to fight, surely I can teach you to dance. Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric
M	SNOW WHITE	Palms up, head straight, look me in the eyes. And... The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even Beith looks on with a smile. 130a OMITTED 130a Cull and Duir sleep sitting up, back to back, at the ready. Muir, also awake and smiling, sits against the log, his hand Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds. As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
M	AT THE TREE	She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART.
F	BEITH	No one's ever seen it before. The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm.
M	QUERT	The white hart bows before the princess, father. Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White. Muir's
F	MUIR	It's blessing her.
M	ERIC	What are you talking about?
F	MUIR	You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see. You who have been with her the longest. Eric doesn't understand.
F	MUIR	She is life itself. She will heal the land. She is the one.
M	GORT	So you're saying she is destined?... Muir can only shake his head.
F	MUIR	No one listens to me. Can't you feel it? Are you ailments not gone? Gold or no gold, where she leads I follow.
M	GUS	Aye! The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs. The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus
M	GUS	Come on! He runs with her into the forest. Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF
M	SNOW WHITE	Gus, no! Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White
M	SNOW WHITE	I saw you at the village. William looks up at her, out of breath:
M	WILLIAM	It's me. William. Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her Gus hears it too, spinning around -- -- To see ALDAN with an arrow notched to his bow -- Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow
M	GUS	I shan't leave you, Miss.
M	FINN	I captured many girls, but your wife was special.
M	ERIC	What?!
M	FINN	She fought and then she begged. For her life. Please?!!! You should know she called for you. Your Sara.
M	ERIC	How do you know her name?! Eric is shocked, desperate.
M	FINN	She told me. Just before I slit her throat.
M	-ERIC	Bastard... .- Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches
M	FINN	Now you can look for her in the other world and beg for her forgiveness. Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC
M	FINN	Sister -- heal me!! -- She stares off into space, a quill in her hand - parchments laid Then suddenly her body convulses - the bottle of black ink
F	RAVENNA	Finn ...no! She falls to the floor - writhing. She fights hard at first - but then begins to weaken - her Then she stops.
F	RAVENNA	Forgive me, brother. Finn gasps as he feels Ravenna cut him off. Reacts in horror and
M	FINN	Sister... Finn twitches for a moment, looks to Eric.
M	FINN	I feel... Then the light goes out of his eyes. He is finally dead.
F	RAVENNA	You will pay. You will pay!!!
M	ERIC	Who is this? Beith is about to reply when William answers for himself.
M	WILLIAM	My name is William. I am Duke Hammond's son. You look familiar. Eric dodges a bit with --
M	ERIC	What is the Duke's son doing riding with the Queen's men?
M	WILLIAM	I was looking for the princess.
M	ERIC	Why?
M	WILLIAM	To protect her.
M	ERIC	The princess is well protected as you can see.
M	WILLIAM	And who are you?
M	ERIC	The man who got her this far your lordship.
M	WILLIAM	I'm grateful for your help but I will take her from here.
M	ERIC	You'll have to wait for your voice to break before you give me orders - William draws his sword in indignation and Eric draws his axe.
M	ERIC	Anyone can draw steel, boy. It takes a man to use it. William is about to react when Snow White turns...
M	SNOW WHITE	Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend. He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is
M	NION	We need to convene. They all follow him a few steps away, where they have
F	BEITH	What is it, Nion?
M	NION	This is what happens when dwarves mix with men. We always come out worse. We have big hearts and we'll fight for any cause -- but for what? For some new Queen to call us runts and turn us out of our homes again?
M	GORT	I've nothing against the girl, but I'm not willing to risk my life for her either, like poor Gus. Beith considers quietly, the other dwarves listening too.
M	DUIR	Does this mean we're not fighting the Queen? Not sure yet.
M	QUERT	What about the gold he promised us?
M	NION	What use is gold if you're dangling by your bony neck, you jackdaw?!
F	BEITH	Aye, the Queen will flay us alive for helping her!
F	MUIR	The White Hart blessed the girl. Nion shakes his head and rolls his eyes, but Beith listens.
F	MUIR	Even our own legends speak of the redeemer who will heal the land.
M	GORT	That little mutton?
F	MUIR	All the lions and wolves in the kingdom have tried to defeat the Queen and failed. Why not a mutton? The dwarves stare at him incredulously.
M	NION	Gus lost his life because of her!
F	MUIR	No. He gave his life for her. As will I if necessary. Look at us. Look at what we've become. They trade looks. They know where he's going with this.
F	MUIR	We were once proud, now we pilfer and drink and dream of when we didn't. I am willing to die for a chance at becoming the man I once was. And that is the last word. Quert puts his arm around his
M	WILLIAM	I'm sorry I left you. She looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes.
M	SNOW WHITE	You didn't.
M	WILLIAM	If I'd known you were alive I would have come sooner.
M	SNOW WHITE	We were children, William. You're here now. They reach some steep rocks and Eric turns around, offering Snow Beith follows Duir and Coll up to the summit of the hill, then
F	BEITH	We'll rest the night at the top of this hill. She has become them, and they her.
M	COLL	That's not how you sharpen an axe. You sharpen downward. Not upward..
M	DUIR	My father taught me how to sharpen an axe.
M	COLL	Well he taught you wrong. He raises the axe, only half in jest.
M	DUIR	You want to test it? William watches Snow White warming herself by the fire, then
M	WILLIAM	It's not my place to give you orders. I misjudged you. Eric looks up. He shakes William's hand.
M	ERIC	And I you. William looks over to where Snow White is.
M	WILLIAM	We shared a childhood together, before she was taken away. She hasn't changed. She has that same light inside her. Surely you can see it.. Eric looks at her.
M	ERIC	You'd be blind not to.
M	WILLIAM	If we can just get her to the castle, the people.. The people will see it. She's our only hope, Huntsman.
M	ERIC	We'll get her to the castle. Don't worry about that..
M	WILLIAM	I've thought about her constantly. Every time I closed my eyes. I can hardly believe I've found her. You should tell her. She'd appreciate it.
M	WILLIAM	I'm afraid to.
M	ERIC	Not telling someone how you feel and living with the regret is a lot worse. Snow White sits on a rock, away from the camp, reflecting She stares out at the surrounding mountains and valleys when William smiles back gently and whispers...
M	WILLIAM	Walk with me. They walk into the silver birches.
M	SNOW WHITE	Up here it's as if nothing's changed. The world looks beautiful again.
M	WILLIAM	It will be. When you are Queen. Snow White turns, surprised by his words.
M	WILLIAM	The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna with their very fiber.
M	SNOW WHITE	It's strange, but... I feel only sorrow for her. William is taken aback by this but pushes on.
M	WILLIAM	Once people find out you're alive they will rise up in your name. Snow White stares back at him uncertainly.
M	SNOW WHITE	It takes more than a name. I an not my father, William.
M	WILLIAM	You are his daughter. And rightful heir. He steps closer, gazing into her eyes devotedly.
M	WILLIAM	If I had a choice, I would take you far from here. And keep you safe by my side. But I have a duty. And so do you. They hold each other's gaze, Snow White still ridden with
M	SNOW WHITE	How do I inspire? How do I lead men?
M	WILLIAM	The same way you led me when we were children. I followed you everywhere. Ran when you called. I would have done anything for you. She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to
M	SNOW WHITE	That's not how I remember it.
M	WILLIAM	No?
M	SNOW WHITE	No... They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss.
M	SNOW WHITE	I remember we were always arguing. And fighting. And... She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for
M	SNOW WHITE	I remember this trick.
M	WILLIAM	What trick? Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him Eric, startled,- awakens. As Snow White chews, a flicker of a smile crosses William's They walk into the trees and follow -- Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds
F	RAVENNA	You see, child, love always betrays us. A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam.
F	RAVENNA	By fairest blood it was done and only by fairest blood can it be undone. You- were the only one who could break the-spell and end my life, and the only one pure enough to save me. She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger.
F	RAVENNA	You don't realize how lucky you are, never to know what it is to grow old. She raises the knife, about to cut out Snow White's heart - And now we see the HUNTSMAN STANDING THERE, AXE IN HAND, THE William blasts with a sword at the screeching birds --
M	WILLIAM	What are you looking at? Help her! The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's
M	WILLIAM	You are dwarves, healers, save her! He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him.
M	WILLIAM	Do something! Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone. 158a CONTINUED: (2) 158a
M	GORT	What do we do?
F	BEITH	What we promised. Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by
F	RAVENNA	What must I do?! Where is she?! Where have they taken her?! Answer me! The mirror just REFLECTS RAVENNA'S weary and aging face.
M	ANSWER ME!!!!	Nothing. Ravenna releases it all, looks up and quietly
F	RAVENNA	help me... "Help me?"... There is nothing more pathetic than grovelling desperation. You sicken me, my Queen. The mirror starts to ripple, distorting Ravenna's face into A wide shot as the group carries Snow White toward the
M	WILLIAM	She died for us! For our cause! We cannot hide behind these walls and watch this land die with her!
M	DUKE HAMMOND	Your grief clouds your judgement, my son.
M	WILLIAM	My grief makes me see clearly, father.
M	ERIC	Here you are. Where it ends. Dressed Up to pretty. He takes another pull from the flask.
M	ERIC	Like you're asleep; about to wake-up and give me more grief. Am I right? The he touches her arm. Feels the fabric of her funeral
M	ERIC	You deserved better. And then he answers her...
M	ERIC	She was my wife, princess. That was your question that went unanswered. Sara was her name. When I came back from the wars I carried with me the stench of death and the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth saving. But she did so anyway. I loved her more than anything or anyone. And then I let her out of my sight and she was gone and I became myself again. A self I never cared for. Until you. You remind me of her. Her spirit. Her heart. And now you, too, are gone. You both deserved better. And I'm sorry to have failed you as well. 163a CONTINUED: 163a Snow White lies pale and motionless on the bier. Eric reaches
M	ERIC	You will be a Queen in heaven now... He leans down and kisses her lips.
M	ERIC	And sit among the angels. He finally turns and leaves the chamber, tossing the flask As we listen to his footsteps fade we hold on Snow White's Her lips part ever so slightly, and she lets out an almost Snow White's eyes open, gazing up at the ceiling, her
M	ERIC	Open the gate. Huntsman! Eric stops. He's been recognized. Percy catches up to him.
M	PERCY	Yes, I recognized you. Eric sighs.
M	PERRY	We have no quarrel with you. Not anymore. You returned the princess to us. And for that... He hands over a heavy sack of gold. Eric takes it, weighs it
M	ERIC	Keep your money. He hands it back and turns for the now open gate. He exits 170a OMITTED 170a
M	DUKE HAMMOND	My duty is to protect the people who come to me for help. I will defend them with my last drop of blood but I will not abandon these walls. I cannot afford to believe in miracles. He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder. Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is
F	BEITH	It's a miracle! Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
M	DUKE HAMMOND	Your highness... We thought you...
M	SNOW WHITE	No, my lord. William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still
M	DUKE HAMMOND	You must rest -
M	SNOW WHITE	I have rested long enough. Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction.
M	SNOW WHITE	I am ready to ride by your side, my lord, when you face the Queen in battle. The Duke looks speechless for a moment.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	There will be no battle, your highness. The best thing you can do for your people is stay safe behind these walls.
M	SNOW WHITE	That is all I thought to do when I escaped. But I have come to learn there is no peace while others suffer. Have you not learned that?
M	DUKE HAMMOND	The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot be killed. And therefore there can be no victory. Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:
M	SNOW WHITE	I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the only one. She told me so herself. Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
M	SNOW WHITE	I have been told that I represent you, that it is my place to inspire you. That is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a leader, not a warrior. Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights
M	SNOW WHITE	You represent me, who I've become - your hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires me. I have also been told my place is not to fight but to stay here, safely behind these walls. I will not. I hold life sacred, even more since I've tasted freedom, but I've lost my fear of death. 171a CONTINUED: (3) 171a Heads nod, people murmur approval. She has them in the palm
M	SNOW WHITE	If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride to meet her. Alone if I must. But if you would join me, I will gladly give my life for you. For this land and its people have lost too much. Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder. Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the
M	MIRROR MAN	Yes, my Queen! Yes!!!! The Mirror Man laughs because Ravenna's face is younger, her The army is amassed and ready to leave the gates. Snow White, Eric rides up next to her. She is happy to see him.
M	ERIC	Back from the dead and instigating the masses.
M	SNOW WHITE	So the Huntsman fights for something other than himself.
M	ERIC	Only if you have need of a brutish soldier. She smiles, moved. He turns his horse to full back, but
M	ERIC	You look fetching in mail. A bugle sounds and -- The Duke's army pours out of the great gate, their torches
F	RAVENNA	I don't need a map to see you've failed me, fool, your face is map enough!
M	BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL	Yes, my Queen.
F	RAVENNA	Where are they now?
M	BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL	A half day's march away. Every hour their numbers grow. Rebels, peasants and deserters rally to them wherever they -
F	RAVENNA	Deserters?
M	BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL	Yes, my Queen. They say the King's standard flies again. And now Ravenna understands -- Snow White.
F	RAVENNA	Let them come. Let them break their hearts and skulls on these castle walls and bring my prize to me. You must not harm her. I need her heart -- still warm with blood. As she strides away. To soldiers --
F	RAVENNA	Victory comes! Hammond's army thunders toward the castle. And then they
M	DUKE'S COMMANDER	My lord, we only have a few hours before the tide comes in. Not long enough to breach the castle walls. We'll either be completely exposed or drowned by the ocean.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	Is there any other way in? Tunnels? Caves?
M	DUKE'S COMMANDER	No, my lord. Gloom descends on the gathering.
M	SNOW WHITE	If we are at the portcullis when the sun clears the horizon it will be open. They all look at her.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	But how?
M	FROM INSIDE THE SEWAGE TUNNEL	We look out at the faces of the dwarves, peering inside.
M	NION	We're promised gold and volunteer for manure. How low has the dwarf race sunk?
F	BEITH	Hi-Ho boys. Off to work. And they begin to crawl inside.
F	RAVENNA	Come to me.
M	DUIR	Seven dwarves against an army.
M	COLL	I like them odds. Behind them, Beith covers his nose from the stench, Gort and
M	QUERT	Times like this I wish I was taller.
M	DUKE HAMMOND	We don't have much time.
M	SNOW WHITE	Then we should ride now. They'll have the portcullis up by the time we arrive. Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white
F	BEITH	The gatehouse is fifty yards away to left. Half a dozen guards and fifty armed soldiers. Archers on either side.
M	DUIR	Give us a couple of minutes.
M	COLL	Four tops. Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the
F	BEITH	Come on!
M	WILLIAM	You must turn back!
M	SNOW WHITE	I gave my word I would stand with them!
F	BEITH	Now let's see how this works! -- With a mighty blow of his axe, Beith shatters the chains holding
F	RAVENNA	Let her come to me...ALIVE! Ravenna's soldiers are merely there to hold Snow White's army Now Eric, William and their men have to fight the road block. Eric and William fight like demons, twice as fast, twice as The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls. Snow White approaches.
M	SNOW WHITE	It ends today... I have come for YOU! My rose has returned .with a thorn! 207a OMITTED 207a Eric, William and a dozen men rush in. Ravenna smiles, raises her hand.
F	RAVENNA	I'll show you thorns! In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and
F	RAVENNA	Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too weak to raise his sword. The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her. 209a CONTINUED: 209a Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by One of the creatures rises in front of William. His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless. Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two
M	ERIC	Kill her! Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers.
M	SNOW WHITE	Ten years you locked me away! Ravenna seems to relish this.
F	RAVENNA	And every day, every hour led you to this ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove you forward, and here you are.. Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards
F	RAVENNA	That's it. Fight. Fight for your land... for your loss and for Hope! 209b CONTINUED: 209b Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under
