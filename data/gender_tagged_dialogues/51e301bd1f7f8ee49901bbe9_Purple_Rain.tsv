M	PRINCE	Dearly belov`ed, We are gathered here today To get through this thing called life. Electric word life, It means forever and that's a mighty long time. But I'm here to tell you that there's something else -- The afterworld. sudden BLACKNESS, then--
M	PRINCE	That's right...a world of never-ending happiness, You can always see the sun -- Day or night.
M	PRINCE	So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills, You know the one -- Doctor Everything'll Be Alright-- Instead of asking him how much of your mind is left, Ask him how much of your time, `Cause in this life, Things are much harder than in the afterworld, In this life, You're on your own.
M	PRINCE	And if de-elevator tries to bring you down, Go crazy, punch a higher floor. relentless, BUILDING with fierce intent to-- before national fame. PEOPLE are DANCING like MAD! VIDEO SCREENS with WILD GRAPHICS hang suspended from the ceilings. Beautiful WAITRESSES criss-cross the floor in a frenzy. eyes dancing -- SINGING "Let's Get Crazy" as the CROWD pulsates beneath the black skin-tight pants, and a mane of thick, black hair presents a beautiful and imposing figure. Her eyes are large and dark -- her look open and ripe. She knows what she's got, and doesn't make any excuses for it -- but the fact is she's scared as hell, possessing a vulnerability that surprises her by its suddenness. An expensive gold chain is fastened on one boot. out her remaining cash. It's drastically short of what she owes and she knows it. She tosses it onto the front seat, JUMPS from the cab, streaks across the street. The CABBIE lets out a YELL and JUMPS out after her. old, matinee-idol sexy with large, dark, bedroom eyes. He headlines a slick techno-funk group called THE TIME which sports gangster suits and wide-brimmed hats. He's gifted with a wealth of self- laudatory humor which he uses like a knife, moving through life with a calm, but ruthless grace.
M	Make no mistake, Morris is nobody's	fool. His seeming out-raceousness, his charm -- every move he makes is for a calculated effect. He knows exactly what the ladies need, and doesn't mind reminding them should they forget ... standing up like Don King, he wipes off a hand mirror, regards himself unabashedly as he brushes his teeth. finishes applying his makeup. Black hair flowing, eyes wide and fantastic, he regards himself a moment before jumging up. He puts on a high-collared overcoat, grabs his guitar moves quickly to the basement window. He hoists himself through it, disappears into the night. about. The Cabbie stands on the sidewalk gesticulating angrily to a COP. Vanity stands by the police car, obviously board, another COP by her side. Her eyes are fastened on a good- on. Understanding wafts between them like a passing breeze. Businessman approaches the Cabbie, starts talking ... BEDROOM wearing a red muscle T-shirt, orange baggy shorts, and green knee-hi socks fastened to garters. A yellow bandanna holds up his hair. the floor. He turns it on, blazes a path to his closet. He yanks out a well- pressed suit, holds it against him, strikes a sexy, half-lidded pose only a mother could love--
M	MORRIS	Oh, Lord ... waiting to get into the club. Prince, riding his MOTORCYCLE, weaves between jammed cars, then blasts down a narrow alley leading to the rear entrance. His guitar is slung across his back. He chains up his bike, moves past a CROWD of KIDS, cuts inside. steps from the car languidly and offers a curt wave goodbye. The car pulls away. her bag, rushes into a dark alley. She counts through it quickly. confidently into the night. The change in his appearance is breathtaking. A cashmere coat is draped over his shoulders, a white scarf hangs loosely about his neck. Wearing a sharp, gangster-style suit, his hair is a pompadour, and Stacy Adams on his feet - - Morris is the very picture of elegance. He doesn't just walk to the curb, he slides -- his promenade punctuated with a dip at the knees you could snap your fingers to. Cadillac. Jerome is solidly built, smooth-faced handsome with a boyish charm all his own. He's a member of The Time, and acts as Morris' chauffeur, valet, and all-purpose shadow. backseat. He closes it with a flair, hops behind the wheel, pulls out. of his CROUP are scattered throughout and WENDY finish applying their makeup. MARK runs his fingers up and down the and his band cut quickly to the stage. cautiously into a squalid, rundown room. She hesitates briefly, seems to sigh, then indicates she will take it. The MANAGER closes the door as he leaves. hotplate -- simply the essentials. She pulls a dress from her bag, a pair of hi- hangs the dress on a rod, places the shoes beneath it, arranges the rest in a bureau drawer. She looks around once more -- flowered wallpaper peels from the walls. view... The night is electric -- the scene beckons ... them immediately, rushes in for a closer look. Morris loves the attention, plays to their enthusiasm with a relish. Jerome snaps a comb into his hand, holds up a pocket mirror ... him the OK sign, ushers him into the club.
M	Prince onstage performing "Let's Get	Crazy." He's locked into a guitar solo, moving provocatively with Wendy. The CROWD is packed onto the DANCE FLOOR, thick against the stage. surrounded by a dozen BABES. Occasionally Morris glances at Prince -- discloses by his look that he doesn't care much for his act -- or his music... Jerome to the backstage entrance where they're joined by other MEMBERS of The Time -- JESSE and JELLYBEAN among them. Morris casts another glance toward Prince, breaks into a self-satisfied grin--
M	MORRIS	We're going to slay him... Whawhak! around. HORNS are BLARING. COPS try desperately to ward off the inevitable grid lock. accompaniment of JEERS and CATCALLS. She doesn't budge an inch, KNOCKS rapidly on the glass door, catching the attention of CHICK, a burly, 6'5", 285 pound bouncer with a white beard and long flowing hair. An ex-Marine, Chick's function is obvious. He cracks the door--
M	CHICK	What?
M	VANITY	I have an appointment with the manager.
M	CHICK	No you don't -- he doesn't see anybody. instantly, SLAMS the door -- but Vanity jams her boot into the narrow space. The door crashes against her instep, she winces in pain --but Chick doesn't notice. He's already upon the OFFENDERS, heaving them against the wall. stairway, ducks behind a GROUP of GIRLS... up the stairway -- nothing. He shrugs, drags the Two Guys off. CRASHES into a waitress, JILL, whose tray SMASHES to the floor--
F	JILL	What are you retarded or something?! Why don't you look where you're going? whose emotions form so quickly, she has trouble sorting them out. Right now she's mad as hell -- she thinks--
M	VANITY	Sorry ... where's the office?
F	JILL	Do you think you can just come in here and take over?
M	VANITY	I said I'm sorry -- what do you want me to do? Where's the office?
F	JILL	No one's in!
M	VANITY	Okay, so you got me back, fine. Listen, I'm from out of town. I have to see the manager, it's important. I'm a real good singer and dancer. I know he could use me.
F	JILL	Do you have any experience?
M	VANITY	Yeah...definitely.
F	JILL	Follow me. vicinity of the stage. Vanity follows her reluctantly, casts a look to the band. She spots Prince for the first time -- stops instantly... Passion surges through her like a tidal wave. His hair, face, eyes -- it all conspires to make her weak. It's like meeting someone for the first time, but seeing so much of yourself in them, that their lips, eyes, mouth -- you're certain you have touched, and the desire to be with them becomes so strong that the very act of touching will release you in a way you never thought possible... rousing, blistering end. Suddenly the stage is plunged into darkness. The CROWD goes WILD! tugging at her arm, a puzzled look on her face--
F	JILL	Here, fill this out -- I'll have him call you.
M	VANITY	I don't have a phone. When will he be back?
F	JILL	Well...you can try tomorrow.
M	VANITY	You can count on it. puzzled--
F	JILL	Vanity??
M	BACKSTAGE	as Morris and The Time pass Prince on their way to the stage--
M	MORRIS	Why don't you stay awhile, see how it's done. ignores them, then--
M	MC	Ladies and gentlemen -- please welcome The Time.
M	CLUB	Sudden APPLAUSE and CRIES. Vanity and Jill turn directly into the path of Prince, descending the Steps of the stage. Vanity gasps, LOCKS eyes with him. Jill seems to jump out of her skin -- it's obvious she has a crush on him something awful--
F	JILL	Hi ya, Prince -- God I liked that song, it's real fun.
M	She fidgets uncontrollably, Vanity's	card buring a hole into her hand. Prince glances at the card, then stares at Vanity, the ripeness of her look paralyzing. He tears his eyes away, puts on his sunglesses, looks toward the on the audience is instantaneous. Morris struts across the stage like a panther, playing to the audience with a relish. His eyes fastened on Prince -- his pride umistakable. them is apparent. Vanity's heart is pounding, she's not sure what to do. She keeps her eyes on Morris, hoping that a Solution will present itself. situation quickly, he again glances at Vanity -- but her eyes are fastened on Morris. Feeling terribly shy and thinking there's nothing he can do to divert her attention away from him, he reluctantly heads for the front door. Vanity finally hits upon something to say, turns--
M	VANITY	I really liked your song too... frantically -- catches a glimpse of him leaving. She takes a sudden step, then stops, paralyzed with indecision. Jill regards ger coldly. Some gorgeous, dark-haired babe, eyes wide as saucers was starlng at him from the bar. Prince has left, and this girl is his. He motions to Jerome, and they direct their act in her direction. suspicious and resentful of her. She glances up and notices Morris, look. She seizes upon an idea, forces a friendly smile, taps Vanity on the shoulder--
F	JILL	Hey ... at Morris, and he goes crazy, entertaining her with his own special blend of showmanship. The CROWD loves it! Vanity is held a moment, but her thouchts are elsewhere. She finally comes to a decision, pulls away, cuts through the club. nothing. Suddenly Prince, astride his motorcycle, BLAZES past her from the opposite direction. She starts running, shouts--
M	VANITY	Hey wait! down the street, disappears around the corner. dejection overcoming her in waves. She looks around -- KIDS are staring at her, to the front door but Chick is there, his eyes upon her cold, impassionate. apartment. a stop against a wooden gate. His house is a nondescript, one-family structure with a wide front porch. He lives in a neat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle- class neighborhood whose occupants are hard-working type fiercely protective of their privacy. of his body like cold water, His pain commands him to move, but the impulse short circuits somewhere at the waist, leaving his legs twitching uncontrollably. Then another SCREAM from his mother, and his father's voice now, LOUD and FURIOUS-- Listen to me! You come home when I say come home! You've got no business in the streets! She's in her early 40's, a dark-haired, faded beauty, with large, wild, anxious eyes. There's a detectable scent of liquor in the air, and her slurred speech pins her as the source. cherubic face, and graceful expressive hands.
M	FATHER	You do what I say, do you hear me?! You've got to keep this place clean! You here, no place else!
M	MOTHER	You're crazy!
M	MOTHER	Asshole!
M	MOTHER	Motherfucker!!! lamp CRASHES to the ground. Prince cuts through the room, lunges desperately in front of him--
M	PRINCE	Please, Dad...she's heard you. She's had enough! wall--
M	MOTHER	He's trying to kill me! He's crazy! Look what he's doing to me!
M	PRINCE	Dad, please ... she's-- CRASHES in a heap by the door... he's got. His Mother lets out a YELP, rushes into the bedroom, SLAMS the door.
M	FATHER	Get up...you ain't hurt. from a gash in his tongue. He hoists himself up slowly, using the wall for support. He moves into the kitchen, like a pendulum, casting strange shadows. The basement is partitioned off into a series of rooms, interconnected by a labyrinthine coimbination of passages. An old washer and dryer stand in the corner. him. He moves down a narrow passageway, enters a small cramped BEDROOM. cacement windows. The total effect is like entering a womb, a deep dark chamber of security and safety. long and deep, his eyes piercing the darkness... la Marlene Dietrich, SINGING to her heart's content. A cigarette dangles from her lip, a police cap is perched jauntily on her head. It's a simple bar tune, delivered slightly off-key, but with an openness that is endearing. Chick is working in the corner, chuckling to himself, stacking chairs, sweeping up. orange juice on the piano. Prince comes around the corner, stops short--
M	PRINCE	What are you doing here?
F	JILL	What...what are you doing here? to think of something to say--
M	PRINCE	Huh ... it's kind of dead in here. Where is everybody?
F	JILL	In bed I guess... Oh, God ... Guess what, I bought a dog.
M	PRINCE	That's nice... Ah, I guess I'll come back at a better time. You think tonight the the place'll be jumping?
F	JILL	Well, I'll be here -- I always like what you do.
F	JILL	Wait! I've got something for you.
M	PRINCE	What? A subpoena?
F	JILL	No...
F	JILL	It's a song Lisa and Wendy wrote.
M	PRINCE	Why didn't they give it to me themselves?
F	JILL	Well, I liked it and wanted to listen to it. They told me to give it to you when I was done. then takes it from her gingerly. He regards it for a long time--
M	PRINCE	You really liked it, huh? rundown REHEARSAL HALL. Hardwood floors, a wall of mirrors, and a bank of windows provides the setting. SUNLIGHT streams through tattered yellow shades. the music for "Sex Shooter" a saucy number with an irresistible beat. instructions to... years old, blond, sexy, with an alluring new-wave look. Susan is 16 years old, with dark, lustrous hair and a sexy baby- doll quality. Right now they're tired as hell, and a little angry--
M	MORRIS	One, two, three, kick! One, two, three, kick! Four, five...Oh, Lord. Cut! Cut!
M	MORRIS	You ladies don't seem to realize how valuable my time is. You're going to make my boys look bad.
F	BRENDA	Why don't you let us come up with our own steps?
M	MORRIS	We tried that... ... remember?
M	MORRIS	Now you're in the best possible position you can be in, so what' s the matter -- your shoes on too tight or something? Let's have some action, let's have some asses wiggling, I want some perfection. Whawhak! dancing. Morris looks woefully to Jerome---
M	MORRIS	I think I'm going to need a drink, a strong drink. Let's get the hell out of here. sidewalk--
M	MORRIS	This just ain't happening. The bitches are okay, but we need something more exciting-
M	JEROME	You're right. We could be doing much better. Any ideas?
M	MORRIS	That powder fine babe we saw last night.
M	JEROME	Oooh, yeee! -- Why don't we find out who she is?
M	Morris snaps an address in front of his	face--
M	MORRIS	I already know that. Jill gave me everything last night. Whawhak!
M	JEROME	Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
M	MORRIS	No, no -- that ain't classy enough. I want the bitch to come to me -- I'm the only star in this town. the sidewalk from the alley--
F	BABE	Morris Day, who do you think you are?! I waited up all night for you. I'm so tired of you doing that to me. You think you're so hot? You're nothing special. This is the third time you pulled that shit. Who the fuck do you think I am?!
M	MORRIS	Jerome! DRAGS her into the alley--
F	BABE	Leave me alone you ape! -- What are you doing to me?! Morris!! brow--
M	MORRIS	Lo-rd..! Such nastiness. Hee, hee -- Let's break. time it to the CADDY. A COP sweeps by, gives them a curious look. Morris puts on a dignified air, then stops, stupified--
M	MORRIS	Jerome, this car -- it's...it's lacking something. What do you think?
M	JEROME	Hmm... I don't know...
M	MORRIS	I got it! The hubcaps. We need something sweeter.
M	JEROME	I think I know what it needs.
M	MORRIS	Yeah ... I know what these need. Adams worked on by an old, grizzled SHOESHINE BOY in his mid-sixties, with large jowls and silver close-cropped hair. Jerome stands nearby, watches intently--
M	MORRIS	The girl has expensive tastes. I wonder if she can sing.
M	JEROME	As fine as she is...she doesn't have to know how to sing.
M	MORRIS	I know that's right. Hey -- watch it now.
M	MORRIS	I want you to stay out of the set tonight. I want you to work the floor.
M	JEROME	What for?
M	MORRIS	I want to know when that sweet thing shows up. You stay by the door, you see her, you come get me, cool?
M	JEROME	Cool. I come get you -- let you know the girl's there.
M	MORRIS	Well, not if I'm with my other babes. That wouldn't be cool. I don't want to break their hearts, and you know how I feel abouy that. So we ought to have like, a signal.
M	JEROME	A password.
M	MORRIS	Okay. What's the password?
M	JEROME	You got it.

M	MORRIS	The password is what?
M	JEROME	Exactly.
M	MORRIS	The password is exactly?
M	JEROME	No, it's--
M	MORRIS	-- Hold it now. Slow down. The babe walks in and you see her.
M	JEROME	I see her.
M	MORRIS	You come get me.
M	JEROME	I come get you.
M	MORRIS	And I'll probably have a couple little sexies on the stand-by, and we don't want to upset them, do we? So you just glide by me and say...what?
M	JEROME	Okay.

M	JEROME	What?? regards them with a soulfull look--
M	SHOESHINE BOY	Either of you do heavy drugs? store windows, staring longingly at the expensive items.
M	as she stops suddenly and stares	transfixed. A YOUNG WOMAN, startingly similiar to her in looks and coloring, tries on a beautiful bridal gown as a SEAMSTRESS adjusts the hem. The entire scene is warm and endearing. Vanity is struck by lt's beauty and seems to sigh. The Young Woman looks up suddenly, catches Vanity's gaze, and gives her an affectionate smile. Vanity smiles back avidly, then-- Give me that.
M	PRINCE	There ... on your boot. gold chain. She hesitates, then hands it to him. He drops it into his pocket, walks away--
M	VANITY	Hey, wait!
M	VANITY	Give it back to mel starts pulling on his coat--
M	PRINCE	You can have it back later.
M	VANITY	I want it back now, okay?
M	PRINCE	Who gave it to you?
M	VANITY	A person
M	PRINCE	Female or male?
M	VANITY	Huh ...
M	PRINCE	You're lying. I can tell just by your reaction that you're lying. her ground, amused--
M	PRINCE	So you gave it to me -- it's not yours anymore. his eye. She's curious, comes up behind him, then--
M	VANITY	You see something you like?
M	PRINCE	Let's go for a ride. hastily. She weighs it in her hand, studies the guitar--
M	VANITY	It's pretty. blazing down the HIGHWAY, twisting through TRAFFIC. The CITY is behind them, receding into the distance. a small embankment, ride down a narrow, dirt road. walks around exploring, casting curious glances at Prince. He stands by the water, idly tossing stones--
M	VANITY	My psychic told rne I was going to be famous.
M	PRINCE	How much did that cost you?
M	VANITY	Fifty bucks. It was a good investment. shy--
M	VANITY	No seriously -- My psychic did tell me. I was in a play once.
M	PRINCE	Oh, yeah -- what did you play?
M	VANITY	Isadora Duncan...
M	VANITY	That means I can sing and dance. Want to help me?
M	PRINCE	Nope.
M	VANITY	Pardon me?
M	PRINCE	Nope.
M	PRINCE	Want to know why?
M	VANITY	Nope.
M	PRINCE	Because you wouldn't pass the initiation.
M	VANITY	What initiation?
M	PRINCE	Well, for starters ycu have to purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.
M	VANITY	What?
M	PRINCE	You have to purify yourself in Lake Minnetonka. Recognizing a challenge when she sees one, she formulates a plan, faces him seductively, shoots him an open look. He stops suddenly, locks eyes with her, feels his knees go weak. Her hold on him is unmistakable. She pulls off her blouse in one fluid motion, tugs off her boots, drops her pants to the ground. She's exquisite, takes a step toward him. Passion rings in his veins ... shocked, realizes that she's about to go in--
M	PRINCE	Hey, wait a minute! Thats--
M	VANITY	We made a deal!
M	And before he can react she scampers	along a log, DIVES beneath the surface. He can't believe it -- her spirit really impresses him. She breaks the surface coughing and sputtering, hops and jumps to the shore--
M	PRINCE	Hold it.
M	VANITY	What?
M	PRINCE	That ain't Lake Minnetonka. words take a moment to sink in, then--
M	VANITY	You bastard. I don't believe it. How could you do that to me?! desperately to put them on. She slips and falls -- Prince can't help laughing-
M	VANITY	Damn you -- I'll kill you. blasts up the path--
M	VANITY	You prick! Are you sick?! Is this some kind of ritual -- getting your kicks! How many girls have you done this to? through the air, drops expertly onto the road. He fishtails to a slick stop. Vanity is by the lake, flailing about, throwing things, trying to get into her boots--
M	VANITY	Bastard! rides down the road as if he's leaving. Having his fun, he slows, turns to go back ... Vanity is in the middleof the road, flagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK. She peels out, bears down upon him. He gesticulates his arms wildly -- wants to explain--
M	PRINCE	Hey ... group, performing their trademark, a frenzied song entitled "Modern Aire" The floor is dense with KIDS, all performing the same syncopated dance. face is drawn and haggard, his spirits strained. He cuts past the BAR, barely acknowledges Jill, or the other WAITRESSES by her side, KIM and KATY. Jill looks concerned--
F	KIM	Honey, you still chasing after that fool? shapely legs. She is street-educated and doesn't need encouraging to speak her mind. Katy is also in her-early 20's, a tall, alluring Oriental, with an attractive, intelligent face--
F	JILL	I'm doing what I'm doing. It's my business.
M	KATY	He doesn't even look at you. That's the last thing you want from a man.
F	JILL	You just don't know him like I do.
F	KIM	Honey... Look, Listen, and then Feel. If you do them in any other order, you're headed for trouble.
M	Matt and Bobby (members of Prince's	group) stroll up--
M	BOBBY	Hey, Jill -- where's our drinks?
F	JILL	They're coming -- just wait.
F	JILL	What you want isn't on the menu.
M	BOBBY	Jill, in ten years they'll be on the table. Bobby ducks, taunts her--
M	BOBBY	C'mon, c'mon ... squeezes her breasts--
M	MATT	BooPoo!!
F	KIM	Get out of here, you jerks!
M	MATT	Sweetheart ... do you have a real hot place where I could stick my nose?
F	KIM	Sure -- try a microwave.
M	KATY	Those guys are deep.
F	KIM	Yeah -- deeply retarded. heels, carries a black and red clutchbag. Her hair is swept back and wind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing. She looks wickedly wonderful and knows it. suspiciously--
M	VANITY	I'm paying ... see? Keep the change. with fear--
M	CHICK	The manager wants to see you.
M	VANITY	Really..? Oh, great...like to see him too. to the upper level. He stays short distance behind. the middle of the f Ioor--
M	CHICK	He'll be right with you. toward her, but pulls himself up short -
M	BILLY SPARKS	Hi, I'm Billy Sparks, I manage this place. about 180 pounds. He's dressed in a baby-blue running suit.and white tennis shoes that come to a point. A dark- skinned, smooth-faced black man, he's wearing small, white sunglasses and a base-ball cap perched on his head. Fred Flintstone in Harlem. A hip, fast- talking jive motherfucker who uses profanity like a light saber. Chubby, cuddly, cherubic Billy Sparks. He'd sell his mother if he thought he could make a buck. seconds--

M	BILLY	Really...
M	VANITY	What time is it?
M	BILLY	Nine, sweets.
M	VANITY	Oh, that's a really nice watch. Very pretty.
M	Billy lights a cigarette, offers her	one, she accepts--
M	VANITY	You look like a guy I used to go out with -- he was a lot older, but I like older men.
M	BILLY	Really, what a coincidence.
M	VANITY	I just came off a Broadway play. My grandmother got sick.
M	BILLY	Does she live here?
M	VANITY	No, in New York ... But, huh, I have a sister here, lives in Saint ... huh
M	BILLY	...Paul.
M	VANITY	Amazing.
M	BILLY	Ye-es. What do you want to do? You don't want to be a waitress do you?
M	VANITY	No ... no...Actually I was thinking more in the way of the stage.
M	BILLY	Of course... how about dinner?
M	VANITY	Theatre?
M	BILLY	Dinner, then the theatre, my sweets.
M	VANITY	Oh, huh...
M	JEROME	Hi ya, Billy.
M	BILLY	Good evening, Jerome.
M	VANITY	Jerome -- I was looking all over for you!
M	BILLY	You know each other?

M	JEROME	Yes, we've met. I have something to show you.
M	VANITY	Great. See you later, Billy.
M	VANITY	You rescued me.
M	JEROME	Ye-es.
M	Prince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt,	Lisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on. An air of tension permeates the room. Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets, casts sidelong looks to Prince. He sits apart from the group, deathly silent, locked in thouqht. filled with nervousness--
M	WENDY	Hi ya, Prince. I heard through the grapevine you had a new tune written by two great girls. By chance did you hear it? Wendy would be dead--
M	LISA	I knew it -- he didn't listen to it. He probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it. amazed--
M	WENDY	Wow! Okay...you think about this. I'm going to be real honest with you. You're really being full of shit.
M	LISA	Forget about it, Wendy. Let's get out of here--
M	WENDY	Every time we give you a song, you say you're going to use it, but you never do. You always think that we're doing something behind your back. You're just being paranoid as usual.
M	LISA	Wendy...
M	WENDY	Shut up, Lisa, please! You should know by now that we wouldn't hurt vou. We're not out to put a dark cloud over your head. It's just to make you feel good, Prince -- that's what it's all about. You've been this way with us before, remember?
M	PRINCE	The nominees for the best actress are--
M	LISA	-- Fuck it, Wendy -- let's break! eyes--
M	WENDY	Do you know you can really, really hurt people? Doesn't that mean anything to you? Doesn't that make you feel like shit?
M	LISA	C'mon ...
M	WENDY	I'm tired of this ... I'm really tired... Bobby, Mark, Matt--
M	PRINCE	You tired, too?
M	MATT	God got Wendy's periods reversed. About every 28 days, she starts acting nice. Lasts about a weekend. ball and chain. Bobby gets up, the others follow him to the door--
M	BOBBY	What difference does it make, Prince. We're still a group, right? stage--
M	MARK	Headcase. Telling you...'effed up headcase.
M	BOBBY	People with talent usually are.
M	Matt dons his surgeon's mask -- Mark	rolls his eyes--
M	MARK	Of course, there are a number of headcases without great talent too. wearing a tight, red dress, looks especially enticing. Morris leans in closer -- her tasty breasts strain against the spandex material--
M	MORRIS	Honey -- don't you ever try and breastfeed no baby now.
M	GIRL	Why not?
M	MORRIS	Never mind ...
M	JEROME	What.
M	MORRIS	What?
M	JEROME	Right. What.
M	MORRIS	What??
M	JEROME	You got it. His eyes dance mischievously--
M	MORRIS	Ye-es What time is it?
M	GIRL	Tea time.
M	MORRIS	So, right. the mirror, staring at a cassette on the counter. We recognize it immediately as the tape Jill gave him earlier, containing Lisa's and Wendy's music. He picks it up, snaps it into a ghetto blaster. MUSIC, without lyrics, fills the room. He adjusts the dials, sits back and listens a moment. Suddenly the door opens--
M	STAGEHAND	Prince, five minutes. cassette into his pocket, cuts out the room. Band.Members are standing about anxiously, watching the final moments of The Modern Aires' performance. He cuts behind the curtain, peers at the crowd... brightens instantly. Just then Jerome and Morris approach her. Prince shakes his head knowingly, offers a wry smile, then joins his band. wide and shining -- her beauty up close astonishes him--
M	JEROME	Vanity, I'd like you to meet Morris E. Day.
M	MORRIS	Hold it now -- just leave the 'E' alone.
M	JEROME	Vanity...this is Morris Day
M	MORRIS	The pleasure's all mine. decorously--
M	JEROME	If you'd excuse me.
M	MORRIS	Too sexy ... Have a waitress bring.a bottle of their best champacne. sexy, half-lidded look--
M	MORRIS	Your lips would make a lollipop too happy.
M	VANITY	You think so, huh?
M	MORRIS	Ye-es.
M	Kim appears with a bottle of champacne	in ice--
F	KIM	Who's paying for this Morris?
M	MORRIS	I think you know that. Jerome! Morris pulls out some cash, pays him, who snatches the money, leaves--
M	MORRIS	Huh, keep the change--
M	MORRIS	Get my change, will ya?
M	MORRIS	Oh, Lord...either somebody put something in my drink, or you I've seen in ages.
M	VANITY	Excuse me, what did you say?
M	MORRIS	Huh...you look nice tonight.
M	MORRIS	It's rare that I out my cards on the table when it comes to meeting younq ladies, but ... I'm going to make you love me.
M	VANITY	Is that a fact? Stacy Adams reflecting the light--
M	MORRIS	Just as sure as my Stacy Adams are shiny. Ladies and Gentlemen -- please welcome Prince! fast, high-spirited funk tune that gets the crowd hopping. Vanity watches as Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy. Morris listens with a complacent grin on his face, his eyes searching out various members of The Time who are scattered through-out the club. When he connects with one of them he makes a series of absurd faces which sends them into hysterics. For Prince is playing music that The Time is noted for, and, as far as Morris is concerned, performs better. Not everyone in the club is dancing, or paying attention, and this does not escape his notice. moves quickly to the piano and launches into "Electric Intercourse," a love ballad which, as it progresses, becomes a personal statement for Vanity and Prince himself. on him. The words have a profound effect on her -- and the audience. Without being consciously aware of it, they're moving closer to the stage, searching for their personal fix. Prince surrenders himself to the music totally, releasing from himself all that is hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and truthfulness that escapes him in his daily life. We are entering realm where life and music are inextricably bound, and the impact on the performer and listener is profound. anxiously. It fills a void in her, hewn by a life of meaningless promises. He searches her face with his magnificent eyes, and ends the song with a heartrending cry which connects with the souls of all present. Everyone is paying attention now. vigorously, wipes the tears from her eyes. Morris, who was more affected by the performance than he'd care to admit, doesn't like what he sees and searches for a winning line--
M	MORRIS	He doesn't like girls.
M	VANITY	I know -- he likes women.
M	But Morris can barely suppress a smile,	and settles himself comfortably into his chair -- for he knows what Vanity has lost...at least this round--
M	MORRIS	Well ... he don't do too good with them either. move through the hallway briskly, past the outstretched arms of admiring fans. There's a lot of back-slapping going on as the Musicians bask in the glow of well-wishers. Prince moves past Billy Sparks, who has an angry look on his face--
M	BILLY	What's this intercourse, shit?
M	PRINCE	Hey; man -- don't worry about it.
M	BILLY	I'm warning you... dressing room-- muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG, held up lovingly by Jill--
F	JILL	Surprise! cheek compulsively. He's surprised, touched--
M	PRINCE	Hey -- wait till we're married, now. Wendy is studying the dog--
M	WENDY	Oh, my God -- look at this! Cheshire Cat--
F	JILL	Notice anything?
M	PRINCE	What?
M	WENDY	It looks like you! beaming--
F	JILL	His hair ... to match his. He can't help smiling--
M	PRINCE	Shit ...
F	JILL	I wanted to cheer you up.
M	PRINCE	Thanks.

The Band continues fooling around, and Prince joins in with a relish. hiding in the shadows. Suddenly FOOTSTEPS approach. Prince appears, gets on his Motorcycle--
M	VANITY	Hey...
M	PRINCE	We have to go to your place.
M	VANITY	What for?
M	PRINCE	I want to show you something.
M	VANITY	No...no, we can't.
M	PRINCE	Why -- is there someone there?
M	VANITY	Why do you always think there's somebody else? bike--
M	PRINCE	Let's go.
M	VANITY	Yeah -- but we're not going to my place. gear, blasts down the ally into the street.
M	Prince and Vanity whip down a	residential street. As he approaches his house he slows, moves past it quietly. house again -- seems to be listening intently... to a wooden gate, detaches a hidden lever. The wood slats rotate like a garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike through. narrow sidewalk, cut through a garden, and emerge from the back of a garage. He leans his bike against it--
M	VANITY	That was a grand entrance. Where am I? quickly across the grass, comes to a

M	The mother and father kissing	tentatively, then violently, finally pulling away. The Mother seems to be taunting the Father, coaxing him into a trap. He kisses her mouth lustily -- she pulls back snarling--.
M	VANITY	So -- friends of yours?
M	PRINCE	Yeah -- the freak show. Prince squats by a basement window, adjusts an old coal chute, then slides down it--
M	VANITY	Hey... C'mon. amazed. She stands in a small ANTE- CHAMBER whose walls are covered with thicks pads and foam. about: a drumset, an electric guitar, and a small upright piano. A stereo and cassette player. are perched on a shelf, and two speakers are recessed into the walls. The entire room looks hand- built, the wood carefully painted, or stained. in through the casement windows. Various MURALS are painted on the walls, A bed sits in the middle of the floor, a vanity table and mirror nearby. around the antechamber. Various KNICKNACKS catch her attention. Small wind-up TOYS lie about: a soldier, a bear banging on a drum, a tractor and She turns the handle, a little TUNE fills the room... DRUM BEAT fills the room, followed by a WOMAN'S VOICE, seemingly speaking in a foreign tongue. The combination is hypnotic and sensual -- she finds herself drawn in ... breath, jumps--
M	VANITY	If you think you scared me, you didn't.
M	PRINCE	Oh, yeah ...
M	He puts his index finger directly in	front of her nose, moves it back and forth hypnotically. She follows it earnestly with her eyes. Suddenly, he pulls his hand away, stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird. They both smile, lock eyes. Passion rings in their veins...
M	VANITY	Who's the lucky girl? Sounds like she was having a good time.
M	PRINCE	She's crying -- it's backwards. It makes me sad when I hear it. It sorta sounds like she's laughing, doesn't it?
M	VANITY	So what did you do to her? Do you always treat your women like that?
M	PRINCE	I don't have anybody right now.
M	VANITY	You look pretty...
M	VANITY	King Kong?
M	PRINCE	Stop. tentatively, touches her breast--
M	VANITY	No.
M	But their mutual desire is too strong.	Their lips seek one another out timidly, almost deferentially...then fervently. Prince stands before her. Her dress is hiked along her thighs, her stockings attached to garters. Their hands search delicately across the contours of their bodies, drawing quick breaths from their lips. They kiss one another ardently, then quickly, like sparrows pecking seed. She goes to remove her dress, but Prince stays her with a gesture, moving his hands along her thighs, touching delicately that spot between her legs. A low, whispery moan escapes from her lips. her neck, her breasts. She moans softly, pulls her dress above her thighs, goes to remove it. Once again he stops her, slowly turns her onto her stomach.
M	She stands.on her knees, her head	resting on a pillow. His hands move up along the back of her thighs, past the garters to her panties. He tugs at them gently, then rubs his hand firmly between her legs. She moans suddenly, the shudder moving through her like a whirlwind ... windows. MOBILES stir gently in the night breeze. his face. She lies behind him, one leg dangling off the bed, one shoe discarded on the floor FOOTSTEPS -- A DOOR SLAMS. Vanity SNAPS awake! Fear sweeps her like a shadow from a passing cloud. She listens intently, then-- and Prince's Mother CRYING in the dark--
M	MOTHER	Please! slowly, her eyes searching out Prince -- he's sleeping...
M	FATHER	No!! for her other shoe. She shoots another look to Prince, but he sleeps peacefully. Casting a glance upstairs, she climbs throuch the casement window, disappears into the night. her wav. Suddenly a HAND reaches out of -- something CRASHES, into the bushes--
M	VOICE	Damn, baby, hold it! Hold it!! Oh, God -- God! You broke my nose! herself with fear and rage--
M	VANITY	You shit! What the hell are you doing here?
M	MORRIS	Shh! Shh! Shh! oh, Lord help me outta here. Hee, hee -- I know you wouldn't want to spend the whole night with ol' pencil dick.
M	VANITY	Your nose alright?
M	MORRIS	My nose is fine, I'm just wondering if I fucked my shoes up... C'mon ... curb. Jerome leans against it, reading a newspaper--
M	VANITY	Hi, Jerome. Wow! Nice hubcaps.
M	JEROME	You like them, huh?
M	VANITY	Beautiful.
M	MORRIS	Jerome...you think these can be fixed?
M	JEROME	I think they're dead, man.
M	VANITY	God, I'm sorry.
M	MORRIS	Shit -- it's so rough out here. COP regards them suspiciously. Morris and Jerome snap to attention--
M	MORRIS	You lock the door, baby? Let's go! distance. the backseat. He gazes at her ardently--
M	MORRIS	Jerome! opens the glove compartment, searches through the cassette tapes. He finds the one he wants, snaps it into the player. RESTAURANT AMBIANCE fills the car... in volume, and will be followed by exaggerated dinner music, punctuated with strings and delicate cymbals. The MUSIC plays throughout this scene -- and Morris times his words to the ebb and flow of the piece to insure the proper dramatic effect.
M	JEROME	Cocktails before dinner?
M	MORRIS	Yes -- two piña coladas.
M	VANITY	Uh...make mine a virgin.
M	JEROME	Okay... wheel, pours two premixed coladas into plastic glasses--
M	JEROME	Will you be having a virgin as well?
M	MORRIS	Ye-es! For dessert!! Whawhak! miniature into Morris' glass. He hands them back--
M	MORRIS	Thank you. Here you are, dear.
M	MORRIS	Jerome, uh, get your pad and pencil, I think it's gonna be kinda right. If my judge of character is correct, it's going to be about loving tonight. Stop me when I get to seventeen. cruising 55 -- Morris looks deeply into Vanity's eyes--
M	MORRIS	Excuse me, baby...I bet you didn't know I had a piece of this restaurant, did you? May I taste that?
M	He takes Vanity's drink, slurps a	little, burps--
M	MORRIS	Huh, excuse me, that's kind of weak...here, try mine.
M	VANITY	Good God!
M	MORRIS	Y'know...they say that saliva is an aphrodisiac. You look so lovely tonight.
M	VANITY	Why...thank you.
M	MORRIS	Probably you'd look better under exotic...red...liqhts. I wish you could see my home. It's...it's so exciting. sexy voice--
M	MORRIS	In my bedroom, I have a brass waterbed ...
M	VANITY	Oooh!
M	MORRIS	I have an Italian cook, Gino Izogochograchi, or something like that.
M	MORRIS	It's funny...your eyes -- when you stare at me like that, it causes my stomach to qui- quiver. Oh, Lord...
M	MORRIS	Do you like diamonds?
M	VANITY	Uh, huh.
M	MORRIS	Yeah ...?
M	VANITY	Yeah.
M	MORRIS	I know it's rather masculine, but -- try this one on.
M	He slides a large glass diamond on her	finger--
M	VANITY	Ohhh!
M	MORRIS	My God, darling it fits.
M	MORRIS	You must have strong hands, but -- they're so soft...like oils in my bubble bath. Damn ...
M	MORRIS	Darling...?
M	VANITY	Yeah...?
M	MORRIS	I'm not usually so forward, but -- would you like to make love to me? I can make it so nice ... big eyes--
M	MORRIS	Do you know what is meant by the words, huh, I hate to use them, they're so harsh, so American...I mean, and yet on the other hand, they're exciting words. The words... ...chili sauce. Oh, Lord.
M	MORRIS	You know, I haven't made love in so long, but with you I know it would be just like riding a bike. I'd remember everything I've ever learned. Baby, if the kid can't make you come, nobody can.
M	JEROME	Morris..!
M	MORRIS	Yeah...?
M	JEROME	Seventeen. lidded, pouty-lip look--
M	MORRIS	Huh, what's it gonna to be baby?

M	JEROME	What?!
M	VANITY	Over there -- that's where I live. apartment building--
M	MORRIS	Here...?
M	VANITY	Yes.
M	MORRIS	Uh, what one is it?
M	VANITY	That one, right there, see? On the 14th floor.
M	MORRIS	It's nice, huh?
M	VANITY	Oh, it's great. Real pretty. Big open rooms, balconies, fireplace -- the works.
M	MORRIS	Jerome! gear, pulls off into the night-
M	VANITY	Hey, wait! C'mon! Okay -- where are you taking me?
M	MORRIS	Home. You and me are a lot alike.- I like that. So, I'd like to help you out. I think I have something you may be interested, in.
M	VANITY	Oh yeah -- what? waves it in front of her nose--
M	MORRIS	A little song and dance. That is, if you can sing and dance.
M	VANITY	Prince is goinq to help me.
M	MORRIS	Hee, hee, uh, excuse me. No he won't. He's never done anything in his whole life for anybody but himself.
M	VANITY	Guys better than you have promised me things before.
M	MORRIS	I know that's right, but--
M	MORRIS	-- not Morris Day.
M	MORRIS	Come by any time. button -- nothing happens--
M	MORRIS	Jerome!
M	MORRIS	One more thing ... hands Morris a neatly folded camisole. Morris presents it to her--
M	MORRIS	Here's a little something for you. If you get cold when you wear it, call me. She watches the Cadillac screech around the bend. She turns, goes into the motel. He watches as Vanity cuts inside. she holds it against her, gazes into the mirror. It looks beautiful. Suddenly a KNOCK at the door--
M	VANITY	Morris...? door, flings it open -- but Prince is there. She's shocked, but recovers instantly--
M	VANITY	I had a feeling it was you -- I knew it! It's amazing -- I could tell it was you.
M	His face remains placid as he puts on	his sunglasses--
M	PRINCE	How'd you get home?
M	VANITY	Took a cab.
M	PRINCE	Oh yeah? Where'd you get that?
M	VANITY	I adore camisoles. room, gives the place the once over, then--
M	PRINCE	Let's ride.
M	AERIAL SHOT	Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle whipping down the highway. The DAWN LIGHT breaks over the horizon.
M	A SERIES OF SHOTS	Streaking down a two-lane blacktop obviously exhilarated by the velocity of their ride. The landscape becomes lush, the trees a riot of autumn splendor.
M	ANOTHER ANGLE	as Prince and Vanity whip up to the top of a small hill, skid to a stop. He scans the area quickly, gets his bearings. He pops the clutch, skids off to the valley below. through a series of hiking paths, then twist down a small embankment. A STREAM flows before them. They climb off the bike, look around quietly--
M	VANITY	God, this is beautiful. It reminds me of where I grew up. My father used to ... forthcoming--
M	PRINCE	Your father used to what...?
M	VANITY	Nothing...it's just... You must like places like this. The stream flows between them--
M	VANITY	So, have you reconsidered my proposal?
M	PRINCE	What...?
M	VANITY	What we talked about last time.
M	PRINCE	You can't be serious.
M	VANITY	Oh, come on -- you know you really want to. You've been waiting for this opportunity ...all...your...life... looks at him coldly--
M	PRINCE	I'm sorry -- excuse me.
M	VANITY	God -- so why do you come around? You don't want to help me, not that you have to. You don't want to sleep with me, not that you have to do that either. So why am I here?
M	VANITY	There's a lot of things you don't know about me. You'd be surprised how many things I could do.
M	VANITY	Take me home immediately! I want to go home. I can't stand this! I can't take this anymore! Prince! I don't need this! I was doing alright before I met you. Motherfucker, you need a haircut! along the stream--
M	VANITY	I don't get this. Prince! Who do you think you are?! You don't care. You don't care about anything! I never wanted you to help me anyway!
M	VANITY (0.S.)	You think you're a good musician?! You're nothing! Morris is better. I never wanted to make it with you anyway.
M	PRINCE	Good morning.
M	VANITY	PRINCE, I HATE YOU!
M	HIKERS	Good morning, sir. wildflower in her hands--
M	VANITY	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said those things. Will you forgive me?
M	PRINCE	Yes. dilapidated BARN. It stands laarge and silent like a painting. A low THUNDER rolls across the land... scattered throughout. The air is thick and damp. It begins to RAIN. perspiration glisten on her forehead. She turns slowly, watches as Prince retrieves old blankets from a nearby stall. Their eyes search one another out, their breathing becomes short, expectant. She hesitates a moment, then pulls off her blouse, discards it to the moist, dusty floor.
M	ANOTHER ANGLE	RAIN patters srtongly against the barn. A deep THUNDER rolls. She's on top of him, moving deliciously, her body glowing in the purple, dawn light. Moist, purple water shadows streak and course her skin as she moves slowly, then deliberately against him. He watches her avidly, his hands firmly on her thighs, and thrusts into her again and again...and again. the wet path. her motel. She hugs him fiercely, steps off the bike, her face alive and fresh as a flower. His eyes sparkle--
M	PRINCE	See you later?
M	VANITY	When?
M	PRINCE	Why?
M	VANITY	'Cause I have to do something first.
M	PRINCE	What?
M	VANITY	A secret...
M	PRINCE	Tell me.
M	VANITY	No.
M	PRINCE	Okay, come by -- eight o'clock.
M	VANITY	Bye... moment, her eyes glowing. She heads to her motel, then stops short -- a single CARNATION lies oon the sidewalk. She looks around quickly, almost expecting someone to claim it. But no one's around, so she picks it up, goes inside. CARNATION is on the stairwell. She's intrigued, glances up the stairs -- there's another one, and yet another further up. She's confused, but grabs them, disappears up the stairs.
M	HALLWAY	as she comes to a halt outside her room, picking up carnations along the way. She opens her door, cuts inside. within. She smiles radiantly -- they look beautiful. Suddenly something seizes her thoughts. She opens her bureau drawer quickly, pulls out the yellow pages, leafs through it hurriedly, We READ: Parking, Passport, Paving...then Pawnbrokers. She stops, runs her finger down the page, then hunts quickly through her drawer. Her eyes dance mischievously when she pulls out her gold chain. She places it on her bureau, hurries to her clothes rack. Suddenly, a quick KNOCK at the door--
M	MAN(O.S.)	Miss V.? holding a bouquet of roses--
M	VANITY	Yes...?
M	MAN	Delivery.
M	VANITY	Come in ... another MAN, holding a bouquet of daisies--
M	VANITY	Hey -- wait a minute. What's going on?
M	MAN	Downstairs. window, leaning against a flower truck. We catch a glimpse of a Man bringing her a dozen chrysanthemums--
M	MORRIS	Good morning, dahling.
M	VANITY	You're crazy! -- What are you doing?
M	MORRIS	Come down -- come down.
M	VANITY	I can't -- I've got things to do.
M	MORRIS	C'mon, ten minutes. I want to show you something-
M	VANITY	I'm sorry, but thanks for the flowers. You're really crazy. stand expectantly a long time. Finally Jerome looks at Morris--
M	JEROME	Well...what do you think?
M	MORRIS	Chili sauce.
M	Just then Vanity steps outside, looks	stunning in her tight, black pants and boots. Her eyes dance vivaciously, a red sash is tied around her waste. Morris gives Jerome his sexy, half- lidded, pouty-lip look--
M	MORRIS	Oh, Lord... are onstage PLAYING a SONG we immediately recognize as the one they had given Prince to listen to. The DRUM synthesized drum unit). Wendy plays guitar, her back to Prince. Lisa, at the keyboards, spots him and stops--
M	WENDY	What's wrong? immediately rips into the guitar solo of "G-Spot." She stops suddenly--
M	WENDY	Is that better? Do you like that?
M	PRINCE	Where is everybody?
M	LISA	You're late -- they left.
M	PRINCE	So what are you doing here?
M	Lisa immediately launches into the	opening bars of "Let's Get Crazy"--
M	LISA	But I'm here to tell you that there's something else -- our music--.
M	PRINCE	Can't you guys get off it? Can't you just leave it alone?
M	Wendy meets his glare with one of her	own...
M	WENDY	Yeah -- we'll get off it. Susan move furiously to the beat, trying their best to get it right. They are watched by ... look on his face, even though his girls are screwing up. Vanity's eyes are wide with excitement
M	MORRIS	As you can see, we need someone with your special qualities. gets up, rummages through his coat pockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's tape. He snaps it into the player, settles back. intently a moment, his face placid. He closes his eyes, tries to relax ... through the upstairs hallway. Prince remains still, his eyes closed... the floor like icicles. Resentment surges in him like a tornado. He rises purposefully, turns the MUSIC up... PANIC. She flings herself onto his bed as his Father streaks in and WHACKS! WHACKS! WHACKS! at her with a strap, SCREAMING at her with an ominous growl of rage--
M	FATHER	You ain't got no business leaving here! All your sneaking around -- you're just a sinner! You're nothing but a low life sinner!
M	The Mother throws herself at him	drunkenly, starts slapping, scratching at his face--
M	MOTHER	Shut up! You don't care about me! Leave me alone! back--
M	FATHER	Don't I keep the heat on? Isn't there food in the refrigerator?
M	MOTHER	I don't like it here. You never talk to me! I'm always alone!
M	PRINCE	Dad, please!
M	FATHER	What's the matter with this house? Isn't it nice and warm here?!
M	MOTHER	You're crazy!
M	FATHER	Shut up!
M	MOTHER.	Asshole!
M	FATHER	Shut up!
M	MOTHER	Motherfucker!! face. She topples in a heap to the bed. He's over her now, breathing fire, flailing about savagely--
M	FATHER	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
M	PRINCE	Dad! backwards against the wall, slides to his buttocks on the floor. He sits there dully, exhausted...spent.
M	Prince crawls up along the side of the	pillow, choking back sobs--
M	MOTHER	I'm just trapped here...
M	FATHER	You always got a roof overhead...
M	MOTHER	You don't let me have any fun...
M	FATHER	I could make you happy. Just believe in me...
M	MOTHER	You never...
M	FATHER	I would die for you.
M	He leaves the room, closes the door	behind him. is motionless, whimpering softly. A scent of liquor permeates the air.
M	He moves toward her, reaches out	tentatively... franticaily--
M	MOTHER	It's nice here. It's a nice house. Nothing wrong. It's a good family. Believe me, I know. Nothing wrong here. Your father is okay. He's a good man. You could learn somthing.
M	She catches a glimpse of herself in the	
M	MOTHER	My, my! Don't you think I have a good figure? Your Father did.
M	MOTHER	I was beautiful when your Dad met me. I was out-a-sight!
M	MOTHER	I looked just like a movie star. The minute he saw me singing, I knew just what he wanted.
M	She fixes him with a conspiratorial	look, whispers--
M	MOTHER	He wanted to get into my panties. mouth, eyes...a sudden stirring in her loins. Her lips part, she moistens them unconsciously... the bed, sits facing him--
M	MOTHER	You look so pretty. Just like me, honey. You coulda been a girl. a makeup pencil, then draws one on herself. She takes her earring off, and face -- identical--
M	MOTHER	So pretty... hard as a bullet flows down his cheek. She puts her index finger in front of his face, moves it back and forth hypnotically. Suddenly she pulls her hand away, stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird. He swallows, tries to smile -- she leans close --
M	MOTHER	I have to go now, see some friends. Don't tell your father, okay?
M	MOTHER	Bye, skipper...bye. through some bushes, emerges along side Prince's house. She has an excited, ravenous look on her face. She hurries to the casement window, climbs into the basement.
M	VANITY	I missed you! Missed you! Missed you! kisses, topples them both to the bed. Laughing, hugging, kissing -- fast and furious. Suddenly she jumps up like a panther, fluffs her hair wildly in the mirror, fixes him with a wanton look. His eyes devour her--
M	PRINCE	Come here. Where were you? lasciviously toward the bed, sits facing him. She laughs suddenly, pushes him back...and they're at each other again - - faces two inches apart; touching, whispering, kissing, hands searching -- shutting out the rocm, shutting out the world... contained! She practically levitates--
M	VANITY	I have a big surprise for you. halfway through. Prince, puzzled, cracks up watching her ass and legs dangling. She drops back into the room, widen. She struts to the bed, lays it down majestically before him--
M	VANITY	Da...da..!
M	PRINCE	What is it?
M	VANITY	Open it. not to rip the paper. Vanity's bursting with excitement though, and demolishes it in a flash! He laughs, opens the lid -- stares in shock--
M	PRINCE	Oh, no... Oh, no! they saw in the window. He's deliriously happy, and speechless--
M	PRINCE	How'd you do it? again, pushing the guitar aside. Fast, furious kisses and he responds in kind. They're twisted in a heap on the bed. After a moment they come up for air, stare at each other playfully. Something flashes across his mind--
M	PRINCE	Here... Mother's earring, fastens it to her ear. Eyes dancing, she jumps up, studies it closely, in the mirror--
M	VANITY	I love it! showers him with bites and kisses. Suddenly she stops--
M	VANITY	I'm going to join Morris' group.
M	PRINCE	What? strikes a defensive stance--
M	VANITY	I'm going to join Morris' group. tries desperately to brace herself on a chair--
M	PRINCE	I'm sorry! Oh, baby, I'm sorry! Are you alright?
M	VANITY	Just...leave me alone.
M	PRINCE	Please...it's just... I don't want you around this at all. I just don't want you in my life this way. You don't have to prove anything to me or anybody else. Vanity...? Don't I make you happy? Don.t you like the way we are? Do you know Morris? Do you know what he's about? He doesn't care about you.
M	VANITY	Jealous..?! the night. onstage. Prince emerges from behind the curtains. He looks drawn.and haggard, his face unshaven. The Guys spot him, and the MUSIC trickles to a stop. Tension fills the room in an instant. Mark glances at his watch, fixes Prince with a disgusted look. cuts across it--
M	PRINCE	Where's Lisa and Wendy?
M	BOBBY	They haven't shown up yet.
M	PRINCE	They call? - immediately gets ear-splitting FEEDBACK. He stomps on the floor pedals angrily. Just then Chick comes up to the stage--
M	CHICK	Prince. Billy Sparks wants to see you.
M	PRINCE	Tell him I'm rehearsing.
M	CHICK	Uh, uh -- now. himself up short--
M	BILLY	What do you want?
M	PRINCE	You wanted to see me?
M	BILLY	You having trouble?
M	PRINCE	No.
M	BILLY	No?
M	PRINCE	No ...
M	BILLY	Where's Lisa and Wendy? studies Prince for a long time. Then he cuts outside. Prince follows.
M	BILLY	Morris called me this morning. Seems he's got himself a new group called Vanity Six. You know anything about them?
M	PRINCE	No.
M	BILLY	He tells me they're great. Thinks I'll be interested. That's cool, but now I've got a problem.
M	PRINCE	What's that?
M	BILLY	I book three acts -- I can't afford four. If they're as good as Morris says they are, one of you will have to go... Billy looks up -- a BEAUTIFUL BABE in a black BMW waves--
M	BILLY	Go around the block!
M	BILLY	It won't be The Time -- they're playing backup to Vanity. So it's either you or the Modern Aires. What would You do in my position?
M	BILLY	I like the Modern Aires. They have a good following -- they show up for practice -- and the kids like all their music.
M	BILLY	'Nough said. Get smart. Straighten up your shit. Time is deep in the guts of "Sex Shooter," but now there's a difference. The MUSIC is fiercer and crisper -- the BEAT tailored, more defined. sporting huge grins. They're avidly watching... Girls and moves panther-like in front of the mirrors... her movements crisp and precise. She urges the Girls on, suggests and cajoles, strengthening their resolve. Sweat lathers their bodies and forms rings on their Danskins. The act is still very rough, but the potential for success can be felt. MUSIC. The Girls dance on a moment, then stop perplexed. Vanity catches Prince's look, shakes her head in disbelief--
M	PRINCE	I want to talk to you.
M	VANITY	Not now, I'm busy.
M	PRINCE	Now. a glare--
M	VANITY	I said I'm busy -- we'll talk later.
M	PRINCE	Uh, uh...
M	VANITY	Leave me alone! I've got a show to do!
M	VANITY	YOU can't just come in here and take me away! We'll talk later!
M	MORRIS	Man -- why don't you just do the walk?
M	PRINCE	Why don't you kiss the one- eyed snake?
M	MORRIS	Jellybean! behind the drums, moves up behind Prince-
M	JELLYBEAN	Let's go, Jack.
M	PRINCE	Fuck you!
M	VANITY	Leave me alone, dammit! Get out of here! HEAIDLOCK, lifts him off his his feet. Prince kicks at him wildly--
M	JELLYBEAN	Fucker!! SMASHES his body to the ground--
M	JELLYBEAN	Stay still, motherfucker!!
M	But Prince continues fighting him with	everything he's got! Jellybean is astonished--
M	JELLYBEAN	Shit!! SMASHES! his legs to the floor again and again--
M	JELLYBEAN	Stop!!
M	VANITY	Jellybean, please...
M	Jellybean settles his weight on Prince,	twists his head down painfully, trying to break the resistance he alone can feel. Prince remains silent, the anger coursing through his body in tremors-- Prince's arms, legs, and feet. He's like a trapped animal now--
M	JELLYBEAN	Lift him.
M	VANITY	Don't hurt him ... door. He resists them slightly, his body lurching in fit and starts. Suddenly he breaks free, faces them with his back to he door. But the Band Members surround him, their wills united, the obviousness of the situation apparent to all. again surges in his veins. He cuts out his eyes apparent. Suddenly a TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending a shot of fear through his guts. FREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend BLASTING its HORN violently. Prince shudders with fright, loses control of his cycle for an instant. He hits a series of ruts that almost topple him to the ground. the teeth. He twists wildly to the side of the road, kicking up dirt and debris, lurching him into the handlebars violently. The Guy coolly gives him the finger and BLASTS the HORN violently. look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends him another obscene gesture and BLASTS his HORN. throttle full. He lurches forward in an instant, blazing in front of the train, The Engineer BLASTS the HORN mercilessly, and throws on the coals. They blast down the stretch neck to neck, twist round a wide bend.
M	Prince edges in front! The Engineer	snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths the words: Fuck You! speedometer: 75 mph. He RIPS past ruts and gullies like a madman. The TRAIN moves up. They blast around another bend neck to neck horror. A CAR is parked across the access road, waiting to cross the track. He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the Guy is laughing hysterically now, BLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the words: Bye Bye! ahead of the train, BLASTS! up the embankment, SAILS through the air... his brakes. The WALL comes at him like a locomotive. He's going to hit it, knows it and... breathing fiercely, the adrenaline shrieking though his veins, watching the train disappear into the distance. knocking down the marquee to a rundown, neighborhood bar. wall, idly watching the goings on. He jumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up behind her, taps her on the shoulder--
M	PRINCE	Ma...?
M	MOTHER	Hi, ya, baby... his head spins--
M	PRINCE	Ma...what happened?
M	MOTHER	Can you give me some money? C'mon, just some money... suddenly realizes she doesn't know who he is--
M	MOTHER	Here...here...
M	MOTHER	Give me something for this...just a little. It'll be okay...
M	PRINCE	C'mon...I'll take you home.
M	COP	Okay, c'mon now -- break it up. Let's go.. of them grabbing his Mother--
M	WOMAN	C'mon, honey -- we're goin' in...
M	WOMAN	You're a little young aren't you? Get out of here. Leave her alone. practically smashing it into the gate. His eyes are burning with anger. He flies up the steps three at a time, cuts across the porch, bursts throuch the front door and--
M	PRINCE	Where the fuck are you? hallway, throws open several doors violently--
M	PRINCE	Where are you?
M	PRINCE	Answer me you fucker!! anger, and pain competing for the same space. Suddenly he stops, listens intently a moment. We HEAR it now -- a PIANO. Someone's PLAYING A PIANO. Prince throws a look at the basement door -- it's ajar. pauses at the door. The MUSIC wafts delicately in the night breeze. He moves down the halllway uncertainly, but steadily, the MUSIC growing, drawing him in. him. He's perched on the broken stool, playing with all he's got. him with every step he takes. Seeing his Father this way, he doesn't know if he should laugh or cry. He sits down silently behind him, listens as his Father plays. moment, stretching his hands idly along the keys. Feeling a presence in the room, he spins around and jumps slightly at seeing his son. He fixes him with a threatening look, then shrugs, hunches over the keys--
M	PRINCE	Is that yours?
M	FATHER	'Course it's mine. Who else's is it goin' to be? Got all kinds of them. They're different too.
M	PRINCE	I'd like to see them. You got them written down somewhere?
M	FATHER	No, man -- I don't write them down -- don't need to. That's the big difference between you and me.
M	PRINCE	Thought you weren't going to play no more. Prince's eyes well with tears--
M	PRINCE	I saw Mom up the street. She looked pretty bad. Any idea how she got that way?
M	His Father bites his his lip, rubs a	
M	PRINCE	Yeah... I got a girlfriend.
M	FATHER	You gonna get married?
M	PRINCE	I don't know.
M	His Father shares a hurtful look with	him, then stares darkly at the floor below--
M	FATHER	Never get married. onstage, stripped to the waist, SWEAT seeping from his pores in torrents. He's deep into the pit of "Computer Blue, " locked into a provocative, obscene graphic with Wendy. She's on her knees in front of him, his crotch moving directly in front of her lips. She's made up fiercely, looks like Prince himself. The total effect is unnerving -- Prince is going down on himself. KIDS have stopped dancing, drinking -- they staring at the display,.shaking their heads confused... own world, living his own private hell. Suddenly the MUSIC crescendos, then winds down like a roller coaster sweeping everyone along. The BEAT changes radically. He turns his back to the audience and plays ... as his Father's -- the song he played on the piano the night before. But it's Prince's now, stamped with his own signature. He's bent at the waist, his back to the audience, alone with his father's, and his, pain. noticeably absent. at the wheel, Morris and Vanity sit in the back. Morris is dressed elegantly, resplendent in a 5O's-style suit. She's beautiful in a sleek black dress, with long black gloves, and heels--
M	VANITY	What are we doing here, Morris?
M	MORRIS	What do you mean?
M	VANITY	I don't want to be here. I don't want to hurt anybody.
M	MORRIS	It's not about hurting anybody. This is business. We can use the exposure.
M	Just then Brenda and Susan come up to	the car excitedly. Brenda is dressed in a 40's-style dress, Susan wears a form- fitting leopard one. They both look gorgeous--
F	BRENDA	Hi -- you coming in?
M	Their excitement and nervousness is	endearing. Vanity's heart goes out to them. She forces a smile, climbs out unaided--
M	VANITY	Your horns are showing, Morris.
M	MORRIS	Yeah...but they're holding up my halo. closing moments of "Computer Blue." He paces back and forth frantically, still locked in his own private hell. The Crowd's attention has wandered, however, and very few remain on the dance floor, finding it too much trouble to keep up with the changing shifts in the music. Even his band members are edgy, casting quick looks to each other, wishing to get on with more compelling audience- pleasing sounds.
M	BAR AREA	as Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris and Jerome and is introduced to Vanity Six for the first time. We can tell by his reaction that he likes what he sees. He kisses Brenda and Susan, saves a special squeeze for Vanity herself. He escorts the whole group to a table across the floor. Vanity brings up the rear, casts a quick look to Prince onstage.
M	PRINCE	fastens on her and brings "Computer Blue" to a rousing end. The Crowd applauds, but it's more out of respect than eagerness. He doesn't seem to notice though, or care. He confers quickly with his group., then moves center-stage. The Band Members trade frustrated looks with each other -- it's obvious that they have some trouble with the next song... "Darling Nicky"--
M	PRINCE	I knew a girl named Nicky, I guess you can say she was a sex fiend. I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating in magazines. She said, How'd you like to waste some time, And I could not resist When I saw little Nicky grind.
M	BILLY SPARKS	shoots a fierce look to Prince, helps Morris, Jerome and the Girls to their table. Vanity is watching Prince, a puzzled look on her face--
M	MORRIS	Hee, hee...little empty tonight, huh, Billy. But I guess money isn't everything.
M	JEROME	Oh no... that's cold...
M	BILLY	The Duke of Dick is in rare form tonight.
M	PRINCE	is fastened on Vanity and it's apparent to all. He launches into the next verse- She took me to her castle And I could not believe my eyes. She had so many devices Everything that money could buy. She said, Sign your name on the dotted line, The lights went out, And Nicky started to grind.
M	VANITY	flushes with embarrassment. Billy and Morris notice this and glare at Prince.
M	PRINCE	looks dead-center at them, and then to Vanily--
M	PRINCE	I woke up the next morning. Nicky wasn't there. I looked all ov'r all I found Was a phone number on the stairs. It said thank you for a funky time, Call me up when ev'r you want to grind.
M	VANITY	stands suddenly, fighting back tears. She backs from the table quickly, knocks the chair over. Morris tries to help her, but she sweeps past him, hurrying for the exit. Chick sees her, reached out to help--
M	CHICK	Hey ...
M	PRINCE	brings the SONG to a blistering end. The stage is plunged into darkness. He strips off his guitar, cuts from the stage, ignoring the grave looks from his Band Members.
M	as Prince twists aggressively past a	handful of FANS, rudely disregarding their attention. He Cuts into the dressing room. Billy Sparks enters angrily--
M	BILLY	What the fuck's wrong with you, Prince?!
M	PRINCE	I don't have time for your bullshit, Billy. What do you want?
M	BILLY	My stage is no place for your personal shit!
M	PRINCE	That's life, man.
M	BILLY	Life my ass, motherfucker! This is a business, and you're not too far gone to see that. I've told you this before. You're not pulling them in like you used to. The only person who gives a fuck about your music is yourself.
M	PRINCE	Fuck off!
M	BILLY	Just like your old man...
M	BILLY	Yeah -- you got it. Tell me I'm wrong. You're not blind. Look around you. No one's digging you.
M	BILLY	Look at your band. Are they in here right now? They're out there 'cause they can't stand being in the same room with you. What a fucking waste...like father, like son--
M	PRINCE	Lay off that!
M	BILLY	Take your head out of your ass, Prince, check it out -- unless you like the view up there. Your music doesn't make sense to anyone but yourself. in a chair. Exhaustion suddenly overwhelms him. He rests his head in his hands, moments tick by... Jerome stand by the door--
M	JEROME	That was fucked up what you did man. Morris doesn't like it. And being a part of this - - I don't like it either.
M	PRINCE	I don't care.
M	MORRIS	Hee, hee...huh, it's obvious you don't have what it takes to be on top.
M	MORRIS	But to show you that I'm sympathetic to your problems - - here's a pass to our show tomorrow night. Enjoy it. into the doorway--
M	MORRIS	Don't forget to bring a girlfriend. Whawhak! the poorer part of the city. Because of its location, The Taste books different dance bands four nights a week and then hosts a Variety Night the remaining two. Aspiring comedians, dancers and jugglers flock to Variety Night, desirous of trying their material in front of a live audience -- and hoping to catch the discering eye of a talent scout on the prowl. out with a beautiful WOMAN and cuts inside. nervously, staring appreciatively at the closed dressing room door. Various PEOPLE in COSTUMES pass by sporadically. Suddenly a burst of APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER wafts into the hallway. Jerome walks to the curtain and peers out-- Billy Sparks and his Girlfriend being seated at a front table. A COMEDIAN is on stage juggling KNIVES and HATCHETS. smile, but his nervousness is simply too strong. The Clown hands him another flower, trying to elicit a favorable response. Jerome is patient, but attempts to ignore the Clown in a polite way, indicating he'd rather be alone. The Clown persists, however, going through a little routine, handing him flower after flower... air, grabs the Clown by the throat and flings him headlong down the hallway. The Clown gives Jerome the finger and walks off in a huff.
M	MORRIS	cuts from the dressing room, closes the door behind him. He joins Jerome at the curtain, and they move down the back stairway to the CLUB--
M	MORRIS	I guess this is it.
M	JEROME	I guess so, M.D.
M	MORRIS	I think I'm going to be sick. Why does this have to be happening to me? Has it crossed your mind that we're about to make the biggest mistake we've ever made?
M	JEROME	I don't think it's all that bad.
M	MORRIS	That's why I do all the thinking.
M	TASTE M.C.	Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Vanity Six.
M	MORRIS	Oh, God-- and Vanity are frozen in a provocative, vampy stance. Their effect on the audience is galvanizing -- the Crowd bursts into APPLAUSE and WHISTLES--
M	MORRIS	What??
M	Wearing sexy lingerie and moving	seductively to the beat, the Girls launch into "Sex Shooter" with complete abandon. The MUSIC is slick and fierce, the Girls sexy and sure. Wearing black bikini panties, black tails and boots, Vanity dances center-stage and begins SINGING. She's mesmerizing, her look so alluring, so profound that the audience sits slack-jawed in amazement. The SPOTLIGHT is hers and she soaks it in, radiating a sexiness that has the audience at her feet. The entire concept -- dress, dance, music and staging -- is overwhelming, with just the right degree of playfulness to allow the Crowd easy passage into the fantasy world the Girls create. Brenda and Susan play off her wonderfully, sharing secret looks with the Crowd, balancing the wickedness of the act with an innocence that is enticing. They're working strongly as a unit now, the AUDIENCE roaring their approval...
M	MORRIS	and Jerome are beside themselves with happiness. The pull off their shades immediately, sit back and glow in the audience's response.
M	PRINCE	stands in the back, his eyes glued to Vanity. Her strength and sureness in front of the Crowd is breathtaking. The audience loves her and he suddenly feels very alone -- as if another wall has gone up between them. He looks away a moment and spots... Prince looks away, moves out of his eyesight. stage is plunged into darkness. The CROWD goes WILD, leaps to their feet, begging for more. The Girls, slighly over-whelmed by the response and flushing deep red, hold one another.tightly and take repeated bows.
M	PRINCE	watches the Girls bowing to thunderous APPLAUSE. Suddenly Vanity looks at him and touches the earring she's wearing -- it's his Mother's. His knees weaken instantly, and he locks eyes with her. The heat between them is unmistakable. She smiles vividly, gives him an endearing wave and steps back as the curtain closes. door. The Crowd is thick, his path momentarily blocked. He spots Billy Sparks cutting across the floor and congratulating Morris and Jerome. Prince turns from them, tries once again
M	VANITY	and the Girls rush into the dressing room and jump up and down with excitement. They are beside themselves with happiness, kissing and hugging one another avidly. Suddenly Vanity pulls away, indicates she will be back and cuts out the room.
M	HALLWAY	as she runs down the hallway to the backstage area, peers from behind the curtain, scanning the club earnestly.
M	as Prince waits impatiently in the long	line. Billy Sparks comes by, spots him and stops--
M	BILLY	Morris is squeezing you, kiddo. You better kick ass tomorrow night or else. the wind knocked out of him, his joy a memory. He turns back to the line, but it has grown, the Crowd now jammed up against the door. Frustrated, he cuts outside.
M	BACKSTAGE	as Vanity watches Prince leave. A profound sadness sweeps her face. Suddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging and kissing her happily. Brenda runs up, pouring champagne. Morris, Jerome and The Time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her excitedly into the room. Vanity forces a smile, goes down the hallway, casting another look a FLASK. Vanity is still in her lingerie, wears an open coat over it. Her speech is slurred--
M	VANITY	Did you hear these people applauding? They loved us -- they wanted to rip us apart, and this is just our first night. I can see it now, we're all going to be big stars. I can feel it.
M	MORRIS	Ain't nobody bad like me.
M	She kisses him spontaneously on the	cheek--
M	VANITY	Morris, you're a genius.
M	MORRIS	Ye-es... it too her. Vanity throws her head back, drinks fully, the liquor coursing over her cheeks. He devours her with his eyes, opens the door to the Caddy--
M	MORRIS	Let's go, Bebe.
M	VANITY	Huh, where's Jerome?
M	MORRIS	In his skin...hee, hee...
M	VANITY	Is he coming?
M	MORRIS	I gave him the night off.
M	VANITY	Why?
M	MORRIS	Whawhak! around drunkenly, trying to discern its direction. Suddenly Prince BLASTS around the corner FULL OUT! He streaks by Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass into the garbage--
M	MORRIS	Oh, no -- Oh, God...No! transfixed. The entire episode took less than five seconds. He twists the throttle, BLASTS down upon her...
M	She breaks in a panic! She runs	clumsily down another alley, her coat flying. He WHIPS after her like a madman. She flies around the corner -- a dead end! He fishtails to a slick stop--
M	PRINCE	Get on! out an excited YELP, jumps on. He guns jumps into his path drunkenly, his arms extended--
M	MORRIS	Stop! Stop! BLASTS around the bend--
M	MORRIS	Motherfucker! You long-haired faggot! the bike and gets off. She's in a foul mood, staggers around dully, her head pounding, her speech slurred--
M	VANITY	So here we are again. So this is it, huh? What do you want this time? her drunken state--
M	VANITY	What's your problem now? What's your main problem?
M	PRINCE	No problem. I just wanted to talk, alright? I just want us to be okay, to really get along. No big deal. hoists herself up--
M	VANITY	No big deal, huh...
M	PRINCE	Give me that.
M	VANITY	No, definitely not. Who are you? You can't tell me what to do.
M	PRINCE	Please don't drink that. Give it to me.
M	She holds the flask to her lips	a moment, his rage surging within him, smashing through every safety valve he's acquired in his life. He BACKHANDS her savagely across the jaw. - she sucker-punches him with everything she's got! He SCREAMS in rage and grabs He squeezes her fingers back while the tears stream down her cheeks and her mouth forms a silent "ow"! She bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at her mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever pitch. leg between hers, rubs it firmly against her bottom. She struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts, her stomach, her thighs with his lips. Quick breaths escape from her -- her breathing begins to race... herself as he releases his pants. She squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward her -- but Prince resists her coldly, regards her with contempt. Suddenly he flips her onto her stomach, forces her to stand painfully on her knees. He rubs his hand between her buttocks, then thrusts into her painfully, driving himself to the very depths of her... back, and meets his thrusts fiercely, moving quicker and quicker, banging her buttocks against his thighs again and again. She's drawing from him now, turning the humiliation around, obtaining all that she needs and desires. He's powerless -- her thrusts set the pace. She rises, Prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly, causing him to ejaculate suddenly, drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry... about her, fixes him with a contemptuous look--
M	You're nothing, Prince,	absolutely nothing. You think you're so special -- but deep down you're just like all the rest. Your whole life you've been hiding, hiding behind your music. But now you don't even have that, because last night...last night you used it to hurt someone, someone who really cares.
M	VANITY	If you put your hands on me like that ever again, I'll be the last person you touch.
M	She pulls off his Mother's earring,	throws it at him. Tears flowing, she streaks into the HIGHWAY blindly, directly into the path of a SPEEDING CAR- spots her in his HEADLIGHTS, SLAMS on his brakes! He SKIDS wildly across the road, comes to a SCREECHING, BURNING stop inches from her thigh!
M	VANITY	shoots a look at Prince, her lips trembling, her love for him, written plainly on her face. But his eyes flash defiantly. She bites her lip sadly, then snaps a hot look at the Driver--
M	VANITY	I need a ride. stands there trembling, watches as it disappears into the distance. across the porch, moves to the front door -- it's wide open. He thinks nothing of it, cuts into the house, closes it behind him. along the record. His mouth opens into a spasm--
M	PRINCE	Dad...? him, leaving a hollow in his stomach. His feet are like lead. He moves heavily into the room--
M	PRINCE	Mom...? bedroom door -- it's empty. Blue NIGHT LIGHT glows through the windows. CURTAINS play delicately in the breeze. He's thoughtful, walks back into the living room... looks at it curiously, wondering stupidly if it had always been like that. Then sudden bolt of fear makes his head swim. A lamp, a porcelain dish, some knickknacks on the mantle -- all smashed. He rushes into the kitchen, looks around crazily--
M	PRINCE	Daddd...! it quickly, pulls it open, peers frantically into the darkness below. He snaps ON the light... FLASHING, skids into the drive. NEIGHBORS jam the STREETS. POLICE CARS a gurney, staring dully at the ceiling. PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures as PARAMEDICS work feverishly over him. I.V. UNITS are pushed into his veins. An OXYGEN MASK is placed over his nose and mouth. Huge white bandages are bunched up along the back of his head. His Mother is kneeling by the gurney, crying hysterically, grasping his hands in a white panic. TWO COPS support her. RADIOS crackle incessantly. A MEDIC cries--
M	MEDIC	Lift! quickly, the bulk of the crowd following, his Mother supported as she ascends the stairs.
M	Prince sits on a tattered sofa in the	and kneeling beside him. Somebody finished taking notes, closes his pad. One Cop rests a hand on his shoulder, talks to him in soft tones. Prince shakes his head slightly. The Cop gives the group a signal and everyone disperses, moves up the stairs. The Cop looks at him sympathetically, then closes the door behind him.
M	PRINCE	sits motionless a long time. Moonlight floods the basement with a foreboding light. A dog BARKS somewhere in the distance. He looks up suddenly, his face agitated, his eyes red from tears. CHALK MARKS on the floor outlining the body of his Father. There's a GUN in his Father's hand clearly marked. rubs a hand over his face vigorously and looks up again... can't get it out of his mind! The WHISTLE is CLOSER. gun...the gun...the... cries. Huge racking sobs spasm through his body. His Father, his Mother, his entire life, his music, his guitar... Father's hand. squeezes them shut, looks up... face, the gun... rope, the gun, and his body dangling from the rafters in the night breeze--
M	PRINCE	Noooooo!! stick and starts SLASHING things crazily, moving through the room swinging his stick wildly again and again. pit of an unknown terror, expurgating a horror that has been festering in him for years. He flings his stick at the wall, unends shelves and bureaus, trampling old memories that have lain dormant for years.
M	Prince lying outstretched on the	basement floor, sleeping fitfully, feverishly. His body is lathered in sweat, the droplets glisten in the pale light.
M	ANOTHER ANGLE	Cool, gray dawn. He's in a dead sleep on the floor, his arms outstretched, his legs twisted beneath him. His Father's outline seemingly rests by his side... across the floor, then sweeps him majestically, bathing him in its warmth. He wakes slowly, stretches his limbs like an opening flower. After a moment he sits up, shades his eyes... The destruction is complete, but in the midst of it lies his Father's music. The yellow parchment is scattered about glowing in the sunlight...
M	Something seems to flash across his	mind. he stands, moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber... After a moment...MUSIC and we immediately recognize it as Lisa's and Wendy's SONG. It plays a moment, then snaps off abruptly. He stands locked in thought, then sits behind the piano, hunts for the first few notes of Lisa's and Wendy's song... wrapped along the back of his head. His Mother sits by his side, her forehead resting on the covers, her hands holding his. She's in deep sleep, and it's obvious at once that she's been by his side the entire time... room and gazes at them fighting back the emotion that wells within him. He leans close and kisses them both gentlythen--
M	MC	Let's bring them back! Ladies and gentlemen, The Time! frenzied throng. The PLACE is PACKED, the CROWD applauding like MAD! LASER LIGHTS strobe the house in a frenzy. It's a glorious night, and Morris struts back and forth imperialistically criss- crossing the stage like a lion, urging the audience on. He grabs a mike--
M	MORRIS	You love us right?! You want us right?! I can't hear you!
M	MORRIS	What time is it?! Whawhak!! does 'The Bird" (dance) with Jerome as the audience ROARS their approval.
M	as Prince and his Band sit in grave	CLUB filtering through the open door. Jill is also in the room, sitting on a table, holding the dog silently in her lap. She casts sidelong looks to Prince, tears welling in her eyes.
M	The Band Members fidget nervously,	knowing full well that their jobs are on the line, and feeling awful about the personal tragedy that has befallen Prince. The entire situation is very tense, and it's made worse every time the crowd lets out a delighted ROAR of approval. But Prince sits placidly, his The place is a riot of color and raucous carryings on. "The Bird" is a smashing success with everyone on the dance floor trying gamely to get the steps right. Morris and Jerome are flushed with pride, surprising even themselves with their impromptu adjustments to the act. The MUSIC crescendos, then comes to a rousing blistering end! his head happily--
M	BILLY	Jesus! past admiring FANS, laughing and shouting crazily--
M	BAND MEMBERS	It's all over now. He better watch out. He doesn't even need to go on. He might as well go home. silence listening to The Time's bluster off screen. Suddenly The Time crosses the doorway -- Morris does a double- take, sticks his head into the room--
M	MORRIS	How's the family! Whawhak! furtive glances to him -- but he remains serene, then--
M	MC	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Prince!
M	Applause offscreen. Prince stands	abruptly, straps on his guitar. His Band Members look at him closely, trying to discern his feelings. He gives them a cursory glance, cuts out the door. grows, but it' s nothing like the exuberance that greeted Morris. He moves center-stage and plants himself there, his eyes staring into the audience.
M	BILLY SPARKS	leans against the bar, a smug look on his face.
M	VANITY	walks slowly up the stairs, gazes at Prince.
M	PRINCE	does not move. The APPLAUSE trickles away. He continues to stare in the audience making no attempt to direct his Band, or start a tune. A nervous TWITTER ripples though the crowd. Those who know about the tragedy feel a profound embarrassment for him -- but no one turns away. Then his voice comes clear and mellifluous--
M	PRINCE	I would like to do a song that two of my friends wrote. and Wendy and confirms that it is indeed their song. They can't believe it! Tears spring to Wendy's eyes before she knows it ... in an instant. He counts softly and... Rain." He turns to to the audience and SINGS.... understanding, love, and survival. It's a testament, a pact if you will, between himself and others... Lips pressed against the mike, dark eyes streaming, he's lost to himself now, loosening all that's within him, cleansing himself of his rage, hatred and pain...
M	VANITY	is crying. Every moment she has shared with him is expressed in this song, and the effect on her is unnerving. Her heart leaps to him in a way she never thought possible. But she lets it go willingly, as the words draw her in, seducing her somehow, making her free...as if the music, his words, all that he has experienced and understood, is purging what is confused and ugly within herself, leaving her with an understanding and joy that burns in her womb like soft fire. A smile springs to her lips as tears continue to flow, and she finds herself moving closer... SINGS so truly, to the person who gives of himself unselfishly to all that he feels... The MUSIC builds awsomely, and he continues to sing out, emptying himself of all the remaining pain lying within. The MUSIC crescendos and comes to a quiet end... you could hear a pin drop. Prince sighs, assumes the worse, then cuts across the stage purposefully. Now some CLAPPING. And a WHISTLE from the back and the SHOUTING. And more WHISTLES and some even SCREAMING. And the WHISTLES and the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing and growing as.... APPLAUSE is building and building until it's a THUNDER, an onrushing ROAR, an avalanche of HYSTERIA that rocks the club mightily...
M	PRINCE	is still running though, his face streaming with tears, past the surprised look of Jill, past the FANS, past everyone -- stripping of his clothes fiercely, flinging off his jacket, his shirt, his scarf-- outside. He sucks in the night air as if he was drowning. He wipes away his tears, rushes to his bike, starts to undo the chain...
M	Not randomly, not haphazardly, but...in	unison. And relentless, very demanding, downright urgent, and...it's beautiful. scared, her face a map of tears. He flashes her a smile--
M	PRINCE	Hi.
M	She's thunderstruck, can barely squeak	it out--
F	JILL	Hi. reach for him as he passes, touching him, showering him with their love. Someone hands him his shirt, another his

M	STAGE	THUNDER! Prince walks center- stage...and bows. The AUDIENCE goes BERSERK! He acknowledges Wendy and Lisa, and then the entire Band. The CROWD is jumping out of their skin! He straps on his guitar, gives a deft signal and-- Die For You." Vanity squeezes her way through the crowd and stands watching Prince from the wings. He presses his lips to the mike and SINGS. slowly, gazes at the smashed table, the broken lamp and dishes. Every item in the room suddenly takes on a profound significance. His father's slippers under the sofa, his mother's knickknacks on the table, her pen and ink drawings on the wall. After a moment, he picks up his father's slippers, studies them a long time. dress is lying in a heap on the floor. The FLOOR is covered with rubble. He sits on the steps, stares at his father's MUSIC on the floor. You." The AUDIENCE is captivated, locked into his grip again. His eyes seem to be focused on something far away. He closes them tightly, presses his lips against the mike. swept up, shelves righted, smashed items thrown away...
M	He stacks his Father's music neatly,	tears welling in his eyes. He places it in new boxes, stands wearily, a fulfilled look on his face. Suddenly he stops -- stares at the awful chalk marks on the floor: his Father lying down, the gun gripped in his hand... For You." He's lost to himself now, locked into a personal horror he alone can see. The CROWD is pressed against the stage, mesmerized by his performance. Billy Sparks is also drawn in, amazed at the power being generated from the stage. Prince sweeps the audience with his eyes, then fastens on Vanity earnestly, SINGS directly to her. a moment, gazes one last time at his Father's outline, tears welling in his eyes. He turns the water on, watches as the dusty yellow chalk gives way reluctantly, mixing with the water, swirling down the drain.

Everything he's been through comes rushing at him like a loco motive. The confusion, the shouting and violence, the darkness that eclipsed his parents' life -- it's all there, lying just below the surface, settled into his heart. But now there's a difference -- he knows it's there and has discovered what could happen when it takes control of your life. clean cellar floor, he realizes that...he'll just take one thing at a time, and do it right. Better than anybody else. He smiles, realizes that in the last few weeks, he's never felt better than he feels right now. He turns quickly, flips the earring to the stairwell... joy. He picks up his father's music, and they both head up the stairs. across the stage, his hands upraised. The CROWD goes WILD! He flashes a wide grin to Vanity, then twists, eyeballs the CROWD wickedly, wonderfully. It's too much! DANCING like crazy. Then suddenly they catch themselves, stop, act dignified. But Vanity sees them and busts up. They catch her look, laugh heartily and join in again. strips off his guitar, streaks center- stage. The Band launches into "Baby, I'm A Star."
