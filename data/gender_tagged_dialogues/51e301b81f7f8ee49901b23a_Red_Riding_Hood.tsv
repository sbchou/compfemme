M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	I am a common woman. I was born in a common cottage in a common village. My life would likely be no different from yours, were it not for the most uncommon events that occurred during the winter of the Year of Our Lord Thirteen Hundred and Twenty-five. I learned many things that winter. About people. About love. But mainly, I learned about loss. A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	To this day, I am the only person that I know to be living who knows the whole truth about that horrible time. This is my tale. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
M	TEENAGE BOY	Did you hear that?
M	FAT KNIGHT	Hear what? The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.
M	TEENAGE BOY	The innkeeper told me --
M	FAT KNIGHT	I know what he told you. He told you about the Wolf. The Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e. The people of that village have been spreading that nonsense since before you were a tickle in your daddy's prick. I'd give you a whipping for believing it if I thought it would do any good. The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.
M	OLD KNIGHT	I used to travel these woods. They told the same stories then that they do now. Only I heard them from a man who actually saw the beast with his own eyes.
M	FAT KNIGHT	Half the people in these parts claim to have seen it.
M	OLD KNIGHT	This man claimed it was the last thing he ever saw. The Wolf took his eyes. And half his face. I saw his scars and empty eye sockets. His skin looked like it was on inside-out. It didn't seem to me like the kind of thing a man would make up a story about. He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look. Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
M	FAT KNIGHT	What the devil are you --?!
M	TEENAGE BOY	Wait, wait! Be quiet! He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
M	TEENAGE BOY	Wait! We have to help him! The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by -- he is yanked up out of sight. There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is
F	LUCIE	Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.
M	ISABELLE	I can't. It's the fifth commandment. Thou shalt not kill. Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
M	ISABELLE	I'm going to take Father some water.
F	SUZETTE	All right. Don't be long. Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
M	CARPENTER	Hey, there! Let one of these young lads get that for you.
M	ISABELLE	I can do it myself. The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.
M	ISABELLE	Mother thought you might be thirsty.
M	CESAIRE	That was very thoughtful of her. He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
M	PETER	I'm taking a break.
M	WOODCUTTER BOSS	A break? Does that mean you're going to start working? The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
M	PETER	I was afraid you weren't coming.
M	ISABELLE	You should know better than that. He kisses her again, nibbling her neck. Isabelle opens
M	ISABELLE	I think my sister's starting to suspect something.
M	PETER	Do you think she'll tell your father?
M	ISABELLE	I don't care. I wish she would tell him. I want everyone to know. Besides, my father likes you.
M	PETER	Of course he does. Right up until the point where he figures out what I'm doing with his daughter. Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
M	ISABELLE	What's going on?
M	PETER	You haven't heard? Three men. They found them this morning just off the Center Road. At least they think it was three men. There wasn't enough left to piece them back together. A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:
M	ISABELLE	Was it the Wolf?
M	PETER	Could it have been anything else? Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.
M	PETER	We should have killed that monster a long time ago.
M	ISABELLE	I know. You say that every month. He gives her a grim smile, then kisses her. She kisses
M	ISABELLE	I'd better go.
M	PETER	Same time tomorrow?
M	ISABELLE	Don't get used to this. I start my sewing lessons next week.
M	PETER	You really think you can go all day without seeing me?
M	ISABELLE	I'll manage somehow. Pride is a cardinal sin, by the way.
M	PETER	I can think of worse sins I could be committing. She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile.
M	HERALD	Half full! Half full!
F	SUZETTE	You mind your grandmother, understand? You're her student now, the same as the other girls.
M	ISABELLE	Yes, Mother. Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look.
F	SUZETTE	My last baby has grown up.
M	LUCRECE	You're only encouraging him.
M	ISABELLE	I know. THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach: ROXANNE (round-faced,
M	ISABELLE	You look happy.
F	ROXANNE	Aren't you excited?
F	PRUDENCE	It's too early to be excited.
F	ROXANNE	I'm just trying to look on the bright side.
M	ROSEMARIA	Well, stop it before somebody hurts you. The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense. Did you hear about her and the Darley brothers?
M	ISABELLE	Oh, no! Which one?
F	PRUDENCE	Both! On the same night! Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
M	ROSEMARIA	Why does your grandmother have to live so far away?
M	ISABELLE	What's the matter, Rosemaria? Having trouble walking? Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Well, stop dawdling. Come on, come on. The girls hurry inside, but Grandmother stops Isabelle.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Your mother has warned you not to expect any special treatment from me?
M	ISABELLE	Yes, ma'am. Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a
F	GRANDMOTHER	Well, then your mother doesn't know me very well, does she? Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside.
F	GRANDMOTHER	There. This is going to be my foundation. Everything I do now will build off of this. She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Roxanne, is this a good foundation?
F	ROXANNE	I don't know.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Why not?
F	ROXANNE	Well... you haven't told us what you're making.
F	GRANDMOTHER	There's something else I haven't told you. I haven't told you why I'm making it. Before you begin any task, you must first always ask yourself why.
M	ROSEMARIA	Why? The girls laugh. Grandmother gives her a patient smile.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Because understanding why you are doing something is the key to doing it successfully. So, before we begin today, let's be certain that we have a good foundation. Who can tell me why you are here?
F	PRUDENCE	To become seamstresses. To learn how to sew and mend clothes.
F	GRANDMOTHER	That's what you are doing. But why are you doing it? Blank looks. None of them have ever considered this.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Isabelle, your sister studied with me last winter. What does she do now?
M	ISABELLE	She works with the women.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Why don't you work with them?
M	ISABELLE	I don't know how to yet.
F	GRANDMOTHER	And how does that make you feel? Isabelle thinks for a moment, then has an insight.
M	ISABELLE	Like a child. Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You will be coming here every day for the next three months. During that time, I will teach you everything you need to know to be productive members of our community. But there is something far more important that will also be happening here. All the girls are paying close attention now, but
F	GRANDMOTHER	You will be proving your worth and learning your place in the world. And I promise you, when you leave here for the last time, you will never feel like a child again.
M	PETER	I need to talk to you. Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant.
M	ISABELLE	What about? Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and
M	PETER	When were you planning on telling me?
M	ISABELLE	Telling you what?
M	PETER	That you're engaged to be married to Henri Smith. Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused.
M	ISABELLE	Henri Smith? Is this a joke?
M	PETER	Look at me. Just look at me and tell me you didn't know. She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious.
M	ISABELLE	Who told you this?
M	PETER	Your father. Off Isabelle's look...
F	SUZETTE	It's all been arranged. Your marriage to Henri will settle our debt to his father. Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset.
F	SUZETTE	We know that you and Peter have become friends. But you have adult responsibilities now. That means putting your family's interests ahead of your own.
M	ISABELLE	So Henri Smith is in the family's interest and Peter is not?
M	CESAIRE	Peter is a fine young man.
M	ISABELLE	But what? He's poor? He's an orphan?
F	SUZETTE	He's not one of us. His parents were outsiders.
M	ISABELLE	Why? Because they hadn't lived here since Noah built the ark?
F	SUZETTE	You mind your tongue. Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.
F	LUCIE	Do you realize how this makes me look? I'm older than her by more than a year. If anyone should be getting married in the spring, it's me. Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the
M	CESAIRE	This was your idea. Now I have both of them hating me. In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but
F	SUZETTE	We knew Isabelle was going to be stubborn. It wouldn't be like her to simply do as she's told. She's too much like her grandmother.
M	CESAIRE	That she is. What about Lucie?
F	SUZETTE	She's a good girl, but she's still a child. Talk to her. You're her father. She'll listen to you. Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's
M	HENRI	Hello, Isabelle.
M	ISABELLE	Hello, Henri.
M	HENRI	So I suppose you've heard.
M	ISABELLE	Yes. My parents are very pleased.
M	HENRI	And you? Are you pleased?
M	ISABELLE	It's a very generous arrangement.
M	CONTINUED:	Not the answer he was hoping for. Another awkward beat.
M	HENRI	Do you have any other feelings about it? About me?
M	ISABELLE	I'm not sure. We've never really talked that much.
M	HENRI	I know. That's why I asked you to walk with me. I wanted to talk.
M	ISABELLE	What for?
M	HENRI	Well... because we're going to be husband and wife soon.
M	ISABELLE	Not until the spring festival. That's months away. A lot can happen in a few months. Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.
M	ISABELLE	All right. What would you like to talk about?
M	HENRI	I'm not really sure. I brought you this. He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
M	ISABELLE	Well, I'm glad we had this conversation. Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri
F	SUZETTE	You know, I had a sweetheart when I was your age, too. Isabelle looks up, intrigued in spite of herself.
M	ISABELLE	What happened?
F	SUZETTE	Nothing happened. My parents arranged for me to marry your father and that was the end of that.
M	ISABELLE	Didn't you want to marry your sweetheart?
F	SUZETTE	Of course, I did. But there's more to marriage than being in love. Love doesn't always last and it certainly doesn't fill your children's bellies in the winter.
M	ISABELLE	You've never wished you could have married that other boy?
F	SUZETTE	Not even once. Isabelle eyes her, still uncertain.
M	PETER	We need to talk.
M	PETER	You have to go through with it. You have to marry Henri. Isabelle takes a step toward him. She hesitates,
M	ISABELLE	I don't care what my parents want. They don't own me. I love you.
M	PETER	That doesn't matter.
M	ISABELLE	It does to me. Doesn't it matter to you?
M	PETER	It's not our decision to make.
M	ISABELLE	You sound like my mother.
M	PETER	Then maybe you should start listening to your mother. It's over. They had to find out eventually. Don't turn this into something that it's not. We had our fun, but that's all it ever was. Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused.
M	ISABELLE	I don't believe you.
M	PETER	Go home, Isabelle. Go home and grow up. Isabelle gapes at him. Peter walks away.
M	ISABELLE	I don't believe you! He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken.
M	HERALD	Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!
M	CESAIRE	This doesn't concern you, Isabelle.
M	ISABELLE	Yes, Father. Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls
F	ROXANNE	What's wrong with Lucie?
M	ROSEMARIA	How would you feel if you were in love with your sister's fiancÃ©e? Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look.
M	ISABELLE	Lucie is not in love with my fiancÃ©e.
M	ROSEMARIA	Really? So she's just had a crush on him since she was ten?
M	ISABELLE	As if she would really tell you something like that.
M	ROSEMARIA	She didn't. She told my sister. Did you honestly not know? Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it. Just
M	ISABELLE	Come on. We're going to be late. She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look.
F	ROXANNE	Rosemaria...? The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed
M	ISABELLE	What are you doing?
M	ROSEMARIA	What does it look like?
M	ISABELLE	You can't go that way. You have to stay on the path.
M	ROSEMARIA	This way is faster.
F	PRUDENCE	But it's not safe. My brother says the bridge is rotten.
M	ROSEMARIA	I don't care. It's bad enough working all day in that smelly cottage. It's not reasonable for them to expect us to walk that far every day on top of that. She walks away, defiant. The girls look nervous. Then:
F	PRUDENCE	If you get lost, nobody will come looking for you. Not tonight. This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the
F	GRANDMOTHER	Everyone finish what you're working on. Your parents will be worried if you're not home before it starts to get dark. The girls begin packing up their work. Prudence sighs.
F	PRUDENCE	I wish someone would just kill that stupid wolf.
F	ROXANNE	You can't just kill it. It's not an ordinary wolf. It's a devil- wolf. A servant of Satan himself. Prudence rolls her eyes. Whatever.
M	ROSEMARIA	Who cares what it is? It's only one night a month. You stay inside, lock up the animals, and you don't go into the forest. It's never killed anyone from the village and as long as we leave it alone, it never will.
F	GRANDMOTHER	My goodness. I had no idea our young people were so woefully uneducated these days. Our village was not always like this. When I was young, this was a very special place. Traders and merchants came here from lands I'd never heard of selling things I had never seen. King Philip the Bold even visited here once. But that, of course, was before the Wolf came. The girls listen attentively.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Your parents fear the Wolf because they remember when it did kill people from the village. Break down doors in the middle of the night and snatch children right out of their beds. Rumors began to spread that we were cursed. That was when our village began to die. And that was why my husband led a group of men into the woods to kill the Wolf. But instead, it killed him. Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.
F	GRANDMOTHER	After that, people here didn't have much stomach to go hunting for it anymore. But something had changed. The Wolf stopped killing in the village. Even our livestock were usually safe as long as they were brought inside. So we decided it was safer to compromise. We gave the Wolf its one night a month, the night of the full moon, and it has left us alone ever since.
M	ISABELLE	People still die.
M	ROSEMARIA	Yes, but nobody we know.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Everyone knows what should be done. But it's not always easy to do what you know is right. Sometimes it's easier to settle for being safe. Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied.
M	ISABELLE	You were right. About Peter. I was being childish. But I'm not going to marry Henri. Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
F	SUZETTE	You'll do as you're told. It's all been arranged.
M	ISABELLE	The family gains the same no matter which one of us marries him. And I don't love Henri. Lucie does. Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.
M	ISABELLE	She's right. It's not fair. I will gladly trade places with her. A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:
F	LUCIE	Shut up. Isabelle is stung, the smile wiped from her face.
M	ISABELLE	I'm sorry... I...
F	LUCIE	Please. Just shut up and mind your own business. A tense beat. Isabelle looks away, hurt and confused. She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
M	BOY	I'm the Wolf! I'm going to eat you up!
F	GRANDMOTHER	What on earth --? The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the
F	GRANDMOTHER	It's my little secret. A pinch will help you rest. A little more and you'll sleep through the end of the world. Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.
M	ISABELLE	I think I'd like that.
M	MERCHANT	She had it coming, if you ask me. What the hell was she doing out there? Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them,
M	ISABELLE	What is it?
F	GRANDMOTHER	Nothing. Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	Wherefore each man and woman that is wise, make him ready thereto; for we all shall die, and we know not how soon...
F	MARGUERITE	Take your brother home. Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
M	ADRIEN	She was a good girl. We all loved her. He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
M	HENRI	I'm here for you, too. But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away...
M	CESAIRE	A line has been crossed. The beast must be destroyed!
M	MERCHANT	Your daughter crossed the line. She went into the woods.
M	CESAIRE	She was taken. She must have been!
M	MERCHANT	So the Wolf broke into your home and stole your daughter without waking anyone or leaving any sign at all?
M	REEVE	It's been almost thirty years since someone here was killed by the Wolf. We've left it alone. Why would it suddenly come and take one of us now? Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up.
F	GRANDMOTHER	I know something. Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks.
F	GRANDMOTHER	I found this. I believe it must belong to her attacker. Attewater unfolds the washcloth. There are a few strands
M	ATTEWATER	This is not animal hair.
F	GRANDMOTHER	No, it isn't. It's human. A stunned silence comes over the room.
M	ATTEWATER	No man could have done the things that were done to your granddaughter. It must have been the Wolf.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Yet she was holding a man's hair in her hand when she died.
M	ATTEWATER	What are you suggesting?
F	GRANDMOTHER	That the man and the Wolf may be one and the same. A low MURMUR works its way through the crowd.
M	ATTEWATER	A werewolf.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	It would explain much. The Pope himself has declared that such creatures exist. The thought gives everyone pause.
M	MERCHANT	Even if you're right, it doesn't help us. The woods are filled with hermits and strangers. If there's a werewolf among them, how will we find it?
M	ATTEWATER	There are experts in these matters. Men who find and try witches and werewolves. We could request the Church to send someone. Grandmother gives him a sharp look.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Not someone. You're talking about Father Solomon. This sends a ripple of comment through the room.
M	ATTEWATER	He is the Church's most successful werewolf hunter.
M	ADRIEN	But what of his methods? The man once burned down an entire village just to root out one witch.
M	ATTEWATER	Unsubstantiated rumors. The Church has appointed him the Witchfinder General of all Christendom.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	That is also unsubstantiated. Attewater eyes him, but Father Auguste stands his ground.
M	ATTEWATER	I have the utmost confidence in the ability of the Witchfinder General to determine the nature of the beast and put an end to it. I will dispatch a messenger in the morning.
M	CESAIRE	Even if Father Solomon agrees to help us, it will take weeks for him to get here. That means another full moon. Maybe two. We must defend ourselves. A long, silent beat. Then, Henri stands.
M	HENRI	He's right. The beast broke the peace, not us. I will help you kill it. Henri's father gives him a surprised look. But after
M	REEVE	As will I. We all will. Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle. Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand. Isabelle
F	SUZETTE	Who gave you permission to wear that?
M	ISABELLE	Nobody. I just --
F	SUZETTE	Your Grandmother made that for Lucie. Take it off. Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told. Suzette
M	ISABELLE	It was folded when they found her. Her clothes, too. Did you notice that?
F	SUZETTE	Someone must have folded them. A beat. Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts...
M	ISABELLE	She was so unhappy. Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously.
F	SUZETTE	What are you saying?
M	ISABELLE	Maybe she went into the woods on purpose. Maybe she wanted to die. Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard.
F	SUZETTE	Lucie's soul is at peace with God. Don't you ever again suggest otherwise. Suzette turns away in tears. Isabelle is stunned Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A
M	PETER	Are you all right?
M	ISABELLE	I'm sorry. I just need to talk to someone. Can I come in? Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle
M	ROSEMARIA	No. You can't. She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives
M	ISABELLE	I hate the cold. Why can't we have lessons in the summer?
F	GRANDMOTHER	I suppose that would be easier. But then that would defeat the purpose. People only change when things are difficult. Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns viciously beating Claude with a switch. Roxanne
F	MARGUERITE	I caught the little bastard watching us!
F	ROXANNE	Watching what? Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom,
F	MARGUERITE	It's money, isn't it? You could make twice this your first time. They pay more for virgins. Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears.
M	ADRIEN	Don't do this for Isabelle. She can't marry you if you're dead. I'm not doing it for her.
M	ADRIEN	Your mother would be proud to see the man you've become. Henri is moved. He nods, at a loss for words.
M	CESAIRE	My father died trying to kill the Wolf. For forty years, we have lived in fear of it. But no more. And never again. We don't need a Witchfinder General to rid of us this hell-hated beast. Because by God and all that is holy, the Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e shall die tonight! The men CHEER.
M	HENRI	You're not coming with us?
M	PETER	Are you joking? These fools are as likely to kill each other as they are anything else. Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.
M	CESAIRE	Get that torch out. Henri douses his torch.
M	REEVE	Who was that screaming?
M	CARPENTER	I don't know.
M	MERCHANT	Look. He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they
M	REEVE	Which way did it go? The Merchant points a trembling finger. The Reeve
M	CARPENTER	The caves. It's in the caves.
M	REEVE	Split up. Two groups. Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are
M	ISABELLE	I heard your father wounded the beast. He was a brave man.
M	HENRI	Did you hear what it did to him? It chewed off his private parts. Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.
M	HENRI	And I did nothing. I was too scared. I couldn't move. I just let my father be eaten alive. She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away.
M	HENRI	No. I don't want you here. Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just
M	LUCRECE	I thought your mother would be here. They used to be quite close. Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing
M	ISABELLE	You told me you had a sweetheart before you were married. It was Henri's father, wasn't it? Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer.
M	ISABELLE	Lucie was in love with Henri. She could have married him. Couldn't she have?
F	SUZETTE	We arranged for you to marry him.
M	ISABELLE	But you gained the same no matter which one of us married him. So why did it have to be me?
F	SUZETTE	I think you know the answer to that question.
M	ISABELLE	No. You say it. Suzette's eyes well up. Then:
F	SUZETTE	Lucie was Henri's half-sister. She was not your father's daughter. Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks:
M	ISABELLE	Am I? Do you even know?
F	SUZETTE	Yes. I was already pregnant when your father and I married.
M	ISABELLE	Does he know?
F	SUZETTE	No. And he must never know. Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away.
F	SUZETTE	Isabelle! Promise me you won't tell him. Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much. She
F	GRANDMOTHER	I've found that there's no burden that doesn't at least seem a little lighter on a full stomach.
M	ISABELLE	I don't know what to do. She wants me to pretend like I don't know. How am I supposed to go on living in that house?
F	GRANDMOTHER	You have a right to be angry with her. But try not to hate her. Too much hate will eat you alive. Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's
M	CESAIRE	You're a good girl. Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his
F	PRUDENCE	I heard there's going to be a festival on the night of the next full moon. To celebrate.
F	ROXANNE	A festival? I've never been to one!
F	PRUDENCE	My father says he hasn't seen one since he was a boy.
F	ROXANNE	It's strange, isn't it? You think because things have been a certain way your whole life that they'll always be the same. Then overnight everything just changes. But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle, Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
M	CAPTAIN	This is Villiers la CroisÃ©e?
M	MERCHANT	Yes, my lord.
M	CAPTAIN	Summon your bailiff. My master would speak with him at once.
M	MERCHANT	Of course, my lord. May I ask to what does he owe this honor?
M	CAPTAIN	He requested the services of His Eminence, the Witchfinder General. You may tell him that he has arrived. All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
M	ATTEWATER	This is indeed an honor, Your Eminence. Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed
M	ATTEWATER	As you can see, our werewolf problem has been dealt with.
F	SOLOMON	That is no werewolf. Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle
F	SOLOMON	When a werewolf dies, it returns to its human form. If what you killed was a werewolf, then you would have a human head skewered atop that pole.
M	REEVE	And I suppose you've seen this? A wolf turning into a man? Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks
F	SOLOMON	My wife's name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was very pretty. And we were very happy. The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face.
F	SOLOMON	We lived in a village not unlike this place. And not unlike this place, our village was plagued by a werewolf. I went out with some men to hunt it. It never even occurred to me that we might actually find it. But we did. He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.
F	SOLOMON	It attacked me. All I saw were yellow teeth. I hacked at it with an axe and suddenly it was gone. There was blood on my axe. I had cut off one of its paws. I picked it up and put it in my sack. When I returned home in the morning, I found my wife with a bloody rag tied around her left wrist. And when I opened my sack, the werewolf's paw was gone. This is what I found in its place. Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches
F	SOLOMON	Her name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was very pretty. And we were very happy. Until the day I killed her. Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.
F	SOLOMON	Your werewolf is still alive. And I promise you, it will kill again.
F	SOLOMON	I have examined the body of your blacksmith. There were bruises on his neck from where the beast held him in its jaws, squeezing his throat so that he could not scream.
M	CESAIRE	But he did scream. We all heard him.
F	SOLOMON	Only when it wanted you to. It used him as bait to lure you into the bit of theater it had prepared.
M	HENRI	Theater? My father is not playacting. He is dead.
M	REEVE	And I killed the beast that did it.
F	SOLOMON	That's what it wants you to think. It did kill your blacksmith. But the animal that you killed was not the werewolf.
M	REEVE	There was blood dripping from its teeth.
F	SOLOMON	The blood was its own. The werewolf most likely wounded it earlier in the evening and left it in the cave for you to find and kill.
M	CESAIRE	'Most likely,' he says. Have you ever heard anything more unlikely in your lives? The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving.
M	ATTEWATER	Your Eminence, if what you say is true, that we were somehow fooled by this thing, it could not have done so without foreknowledge of our plan to hunt it.
F	SOLOMON	That's correct. The werewolf does not live in the forest as you have rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives here in the village. Among you. There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting
M	CESAIRE	You come here and tell us that this boy's father died for nothing. You accuse us and call us fools. Well, I believe what I can see with my own eyes. That wolf is dead. And I know it's dead because I was with the brave men who killed it.
M	MERCHANT	And what of the festival?
M	ATTEWATER	The festival was to celebrate the death of the Wolf.
M	MERCHANT	And we say that it's dead! We've spent every full moon for the past forty years cowering in our homes. We've earned a celebration.
M	REEVE	And paid for it in blood! Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.
F	SOLOMON	Have your festival. I will stay on here until then to ensure that you have the celebration you all so richly deserve. The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug
F	SOLOMON	Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et sempter, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen.
M	ISABELLE	I'm going to the festival.
F	SUZETTE	All right then. She doesn't look up from her knitting. Isabelle leaves.
F	ROXANNE	I'm sorry... She hurries to help Claude. Isabelle and Prudence watch.
F	PRUDENCE	She acts more like a mother to him than a sister.
M	ISABELLE	Someone has to look after him.
F	PRUDENCE	I know. But who looks after her? Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look.
M	PETER	Take it easy, friend.
M	HENRI	You didn't come with us. The night my father died. Peter's smile fades. Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away.
M	HENRI	You stayed here and let real men do the work you didn't have the belly for.
M	ISABELLE	Please, don't do this -- Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles. overreacts and punches Peter in the eye. Peter falls on Peter slowly stands, staring Henri down. He could easily
M	ISABELLE	Peter! Wait!
M	PETER	Why? So you can hit me, too?
M	ISABELLE	I just want to make sure you're all right. Peter stops. He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous.
M	PETER	Why can't you just leave me alone?
M	ISABELLE	You're bleeding.
M	PETER	So what? What's the matter with you? What do I have to do to make you stop caring about me? Isabelle is taken aback. A beat.
M	ISABELLE	You think I want to feel like this? You think I enjoy feeling like a fool every day because I can't stop loving you? Peter's bravado falters. He can't completely hide what
M	ISABELLE	Why are you with Rosemaria? You hate Rosemaria.
M	PETER	I don't have to like her to get what I want from her.
M	ISABELLE	You're a terrible liar. Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her
M	ISABELLE	There. You're heart is starting to beat faster. And the little black circles in the middle of your eyes still get bigger when I touch you. She gazes up at him. He tries not to look in her eyes,
M	ISABELLE	You can tell me you don't love me, but I know what you're really feeling. I can feel it with my hand and see it with my eyes. Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own.
M	PETER	I thought being with Rosemaria would be the one thing you would never be able to forgive. I wanted you to hate me. Isabelle, you are the best thing that could ever happen to me. And I am the worst thing that could ever happen to you.
M	ISABELLE	How could you think that?
M	PETER	I wasn't born here. You and I both know what that means. I will always be a stranger to these people. Your parents will never let us be together.
M	ISABELLE	That means less to me now than ever. We can leave here. We can go someplace where we'll both be strangers.
M	PETER	I can't let you do that. You have something here that I will never have. You have a place. You have a family. With Henri you have a future. I'm not going to let you ruin that over me.
M	ISABELLE	The only life I want is with you.
M	PETER	Isabelle... I'm wrong for you.
M	ISABELLE	I know you are. I just don't care. She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as
M	ISABELLE	I don't want to wait.
M	PETER	But not like this. I want to marry you. She searches his face and sees that he's serious.
M	PETER	I can pack the cart tonight and we can leave in the morning. Is that too soon?
M	ISABELLE	It's not soon enough. She pulls him to her and kisses him.
M	PETER	You'd better get back before someone misses you. She gives him a lingering kiss. When she pulls away from
M	PETER	What's wrong?
M	ISABELLE	This feels like a dream. I'm afraid if I leave you I might wake up. He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them
M	ISABELLE	I've never seen it full before... Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams.
F	ROXANNE	Claude! Then something massive pushes its way through the surging A moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on
F	SOLOMON	Get to the church, you fools! The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:
M	HOLY LOVE!	The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it. Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
F	ROXANNE	Where's Claude? Where is he?!
F	ROXANNE	Claude! Claude! Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.
F	ROXANNE	Have you seen my brother? Please! But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
M	SOLDIER #1	Help... Help me... Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
M	ROXANNE (O.S.)	Claude! Claude!! The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...
F	ROXANNE	Claude! Where are you?! Isabelle drags her to the ground and covers her mouth.
M	ISABELLE	You have to stop it. He can't hear you and you are going to get us killed. Do you understand me? Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
M	ISABELLE	Come on! Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
M	THE WOLF	Well, well. You look very pretty this evening, my dear. Good enough to eat. The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
M	THE WOLF	It's considered polite to thank someone when they pay you a compliment. Are you being impolite, Isabelle?
M	ISABELLE	How do you know me? Who are you?
F	ROXANNE	Isabelle...? The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
M	ISABELLE	What big eyes you have...
M	THE WOLF	The better to see you with, my dear.
M	ISABELLE	Are you going to kill us?
M	THE WOLF	Kill you? Why would I kill you?
M	ISABELLE	Then what do you want?
M	THE WOLF	I want you, Isabelle. Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed.
M	THE WOLF	We are the same, you and I. We are both wild things. You show one face to the world, but there is another face that you hide. A fire burning inside you, waiting to be released. The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
M	THE WOLF	Yes. I can smell it on you even now. Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
M	THE WOLF	Leave with me tonight. Run with me. The only shackles binding you are of your own making. Slip them and I can show you the world and every pleasure in it. Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:
M	ISABELLE	I don't know who you are, but we are not the same. I would rather die than go with you.
M	THE WOLF	What about your fat friend here? Do you think she would rather die? Come away with me. Or I will kill her. And I will keep killing until you agree to leave with me. Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,
M	THE WOLF	Choose now. Quickly. Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified
M	THE WOLF	Your silence has doomed them all. Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The
M	THE WOLF	Come the next full moon, their blood will be on your hands. Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
F	SOLOMON	We are safe here. God protects his own house and those within it. Isabelle finds Prudence.
M	ISABELLE	Is Peter here?
F	PRUDENCE	Peter? I don't think so.
M	ISABELLE	What about Claude? Or my parents?
F	PRUDENCE	I haven't seen any of them.
M	ISABELLE	Would you look for them? Please? Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a
F	ROXANNE	You talked to it.
M	ISABELLE	It talked to us. A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.
F	ROXANNE	No. It only growled. You heard it talk to you? Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to
M	ISABELLE	Do not speak of this to anyone. Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns
M	ISABELLE	Mother! Father!
M	ISABELLE	Is she dead?
M	CESAIRE	No, thank God. He sits up, revealing Suzette's face, which has been
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	This man is alive! Bring me water! Hurry! Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
F	SOLOMON	Are you bitten? Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his
F	SOLOMON	Step back. Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before
F	SOLOMON	The werewolf's bite is the same as death to a man. Stunned silence. Solomon turns to the Villagers.
F	SOLOMON	The dark days have returned to your village. Your homes are no longer safe. The Wolf will return. Again and again. And it will not stop until it has sucked the marrow from all your bones. Unless you stop it. But to kill a monster, you must become one yourself. A wolf caught in a trap will chew off its own leg to save itself. Will you do the same? What sacrifice will you make to save your families and your way of life? Will you do whatever it takes? Or will you cower in your beds and die like sheep? A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the
F	SOLOMON	It appears my expertise is not as appreciated as I was led to believe. He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.
M	ATTEWATER	Wait! Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
M	ATTEWATER	We will do what must be done. A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
M	PETER	I was up all night worrying about you. Thank God you're safe. But something about her expression gives him pause. She
M	ISABELLE	Peter... My mother's hurt. I can't leave. Not now.
M	PETER	I thought you didn't want to wait.
M	ISABELLE	I don't have any choice. It's not just my mother. Something else happened last night.
M	ISABELLE (CONT'D)	I can't tell you about it. I just have to stay. Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.
M	ISABELLE	I meant everything I said. This isn't what I wanted.
M	PETER	Of course not. You'd better go home and see to your mother. She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go. She pauses at
F	SOLOMON	Silver. This is our most potent weapon. One blow will kill it. That sword has tasted the blood of many such creatures. But never one as powerful as this.
M	ATTEWATER	If it's that powerful, how can we possibly hope to stop it?
F	SOLOMON	We must find it in its human form. Who among you do you suspect? Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks.
F	SOLOMON	It has not survived this long by being obvious. The signs will be subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness. Strange behavior. Strange smells. Well, none of them smell good, but we must start somewhere.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	What about the hair Madame Ordeville found on Lucie's body? It was dark. The person we are looking for must have dark hair.
F	SOLOMON	Perhaps. Unless it planted the hair to make us think that.
M	ATTEWATER	Yes, it's trying to trick us again. This has been happening for forty years. It must be an old man by now. The hair should have been gray.
F	SOLOMON	Not necessarily. It may be the child or grandchild of the werewolf that first struck here.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	The curse is hereditary?
F	SOLOMON	It is. But it effects men and women differently. A man can inherit the curse. Or he can be turned simply by being bitten. Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.
F	SOLOMON	But women are immune to the werewolf's bite. In order for a woman to be turned, she must inherit the curse. But even then it will lie dormant unless she eats human flesh. Only then will the bite of a male werewolf change her. Only then can she become a werewolf and capable of passing the curse on to her own children.
M	ATTEWATER	But it could be a woman.
F	SOLOMON	Of course. It could be any one of you. Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.
M	ISABELLE	Has Claude come home?
F	ROXANNE	No. Nobody has seen him.
M	ISABELLE	He's run away before. He'll be all right. Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They
F	PRUDENCE	Well. I suppose this is all of us. The three of them turn and start toward the woods...
F	GRANDMOTHER	It talked to you. And you understood it?
M	ISABELLE	As clearly as I do you now. Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Word of this cannot be allowed to spread. Do you understand me?
M	ISABELLE	Roxanne will never speak of it. She won't even talk to me about it. A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then:
M	ISABELLE	I have to do what it wants. I have communed with an unholy beast. What does that make me if not cursed?
F	GRANDMOTHER	I don't know. But I won't allow you to go with this devil and live as its concubine.
M	ISABELLE	But if it comes back for me and I don't go with it, then it will kill again. If I have the power to save even one life, aren't I compelled to do so?
F	GRANDMOTHER	This is why it chose you. You're a good girl with a gentle heart. It's using that against you.
M	ISABELLE	But how could it? Unless it really does know me? Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look...
M	HENRI	I spoke with your father. I broke off our engagement. I saw you with Peter. Don't worry, I didn't tell anyone. Isabelle can't hide her shock. She shifts anxiously.
M	ISABELLE	What about my family's debt?
M	HENRI	I have no interest in ruining your family. I will have you out of love or not at all. Isabelle is dumbfounded. Henri turns and walks away...
F	PRUDENCE	They've caught the werewolf!
F	PRUDENCE	He's been hiding in a hayloft. They caught him trying to steal food.
M	ISABELLE	But who is it? An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all
M	ISABELLE	What's wrong? What's happening? Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd.
M	CESAIRE	Isabelle! Get away from there! She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as
F	ROXANNE	Claude!!
M	ISABELLE	It's not him! It can't be!
M	LUCRECE	If he's not the werewolf, then why was he hiding? What's he afraid of? The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after
M	GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)	Salus populi suprema est lex. He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him. She
F	GRANDMOTHER	The good of the people is the chief law.
M	ATTEWATER	You read Latin.
F	GRANDMOTHER	And write. I was studying to be a nun when I met my husband.
M	ATTEWATER	He must have been some man.
F	GRANDMOTHER	He was a priest. She grins. Is she being serious? Attewater bristles.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You know the boy is innocent. He's being tried because he's different. Because Father Solomon knows he can turn us against him.
M	ATTEWATER	Father Solomon is here to protect us.
F	GRANDMOTHER	A wolf hunting sheep picks off the weakest ones first. This is just the beginning. She enters the manor hall. Attewater watches her go.
F	SOLOMON	You say you saw the accused perform magic?
M	LUCRECE	In broad daylight with my own eyes. Everyone here has seen it.
F	SOLOMON	So it was common knowledge that the accused was a conjurer?
M	LUCRECE	Yes, Your Eminence. I saw it for the Devil's work, but they laughed at me and paid him money. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him...
F	SOLOMON	Are you aware that it is the custom of witches and devil worshippers to hold their black sabbaths in cemeteries?
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	Yes, Your Eminence.
F	SOLOMON	And do you know of their practice of dancing with invisible devils during these rituals?
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	I have heard it said so, yes.
F	SOLOMON	Is there one here today who you have seen dancing in your cemetery?
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	Yes. But I don't believe he meant anything by it. It was in jest.
F	SOLOMON	So you consider the black mass to be a jest? There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	No, of course not.
F	SOLOMON	Then point him out. Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude.
F	MARGUERITE	Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude.
F	SOLOMON	What is your relationship to the accused?
F	MARGUERITE	I am his mother.
F	SOLOMON	And where is his father?
F	MARGUERITE	I don't know, sir.
F	SOLOMON	Well, what is his name? She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat.
F	MARGUERITE	I never learned his name, sir.
F	SOLOMON	You say a man whose name you cannot recall is the father of your child? What can you tell us about him?
F	MARGUERITE	Not much, sir. She lowers her eyes, ashamed. Solomon considers her.
F	SOLOMON	Almost as if it were a dream? Certain devils called incubi can collect human semen and then transfer it to women as they sleep. A woman who unwittingly conceives in this manner would not be a whore. She would be blameless in the eyes of God. Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful...
F	SOLOMON	You remember almost nothing of the man who impregnated you. Is it not possible that there was no man? That the accused is not the product of your own sin, but the foul offspring of a werewolf whose semen was placed in you by an incubus while you slept?
F	MARGUERITE	Yes! Yes, I remember now! He came to me in my sleep! It wasn't my fault! God save me, it wasn't my fault! Roxanne buries her face in her hands.
F	SOLOMON	We have proven here today that behind this veil of feigned idiocy is the fiend that has plagued your village. However, in order for the sentence of death to be carried out, the Church requires either a confession or the testimony of a witness who has seen the accused in his transformed state. Since the accused has refused to confess, this court calls upon its final witness. Isabelle Ordeville. Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.
F	SOLOMON	On the night of the last full moon, you were attacked by the Wolf. You looked it in the eye. And the one thing a werewolf can never change is its eyes. He gestures to the Soldiers. They grab Claude and force
F	SOLOMON	Look into his eyes, my child. Do you see the beast in them? Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches,
M	ISABELLE	It isn't him. It can't be. He was with us when the Wolf attacked. Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.
F	SOLOMON	Is this true? Is there another here who can speak to this?
F	ROXANNE	I can! It's true! I saw him!
M	LUCRECE	She's his sister! She'll say anything! The suspicious Villagers agree. Roxanne gives Isabelle a
M	ISABELLE	He was there! He carried Claude away! He saved his life! Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks
M	CARPENTER	She is mistaken. I did no such thing. Isabelle is shocked. She looks to the other Villagers,
F	SOLOMON	Very well. Since no one here can bear witness, we must extort a confession. This court shall reconvene tomorrow at dawn. Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by
M	ISABELLE	Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen to me? Doesn't he care that Claude isn't guilty?
F	GRANDMOTHER	He'd rather let an innocent boy die than risk letting the Wolf go free.
M	ISABELLE	But the Wolf is free. And the moon will be full in two days. The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans
F	GRANDMOTHER	We both know it will be coming for you. You must leave here tomorrow and never return. A long beat. Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head.
M	ISABELLE	I cannot leave.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You have no choice. The alternative is unthinkable.
M	ISABELLE	What is unthinkable is that I should be responsible for the deaths of everyone that I love. I'd rather spend a lifetime of misery than let that happen.
F	GRANDMOTHER	The Wolf's sins are on its own twice-damned soul, not yours.
M	ISABELLE	But what if it was you it wanted? Would you go with it to save me? Or would you leave me to die? Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Father Solomon. Extorting his confession. Claude's screams sending chills down their spines.
M	CESAIRE	You should have condemned him today. At least it would have been quick. Cesaire turns and goes back inside. Isabelle and
F	ROXANNE	How can you just sit there and listen to this? Marguerite ignores her. Furious, Roxanne stands up and
F	MARGUERITE	Where are you going with that? Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak.
F	ROXANNE	Don't you touch me again. Ever. Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves.
F	SOLOMON	Enough of this. Let's eat. He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a
M	ATTEWATER	What is this?
F	SOLOMON	A statement declaring that you heard the boy confess. All it requires is your signature. Or your mark, if you cannot write.
M	ATTEWATER	But he has not confessed. How could he have? Solomon studies Attewater. A beat. Solomon shrugs.
F	SOLOMON	Very well. Listen more carefully this time. He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the
F	SOLOMON	Listen to how he sings of his love of Satan. How he despairs that he will never again copulate with the dead or sink his teeth into the flesh of pregnant women and eat their unborn children. Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly
M	ATTEWATER	Stop this.
F	SOLOMON	No. You stop it. We both know he is guilty. But I cannot legally execute him without a witness or a confession. Sign this and we have a confession. Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags
F	SOLOMON	This is the business of werewolf hunting and you had best develop a stomach for it. Because where there is one werewolf, there are two. And where there are two, there are more. This is only the beginning. Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves. Attewater
M	CAPTAIN	A girl to see you.
F	SOLOMON	Well, I've yet to come across a girl I wouldn't at least look at. The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps
F	SOLOMON	I assume you came here with a purpose. She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in
F	ROXANNE	I would like to bargain for the release of my brother.
F	SOLOMON	Your brother has just confessed.
F	ROXANNE	What? That's not possible!
F	SOLOMON	It has been witnessed and notarized. He will hang in the morning.
M	CONTINUED:	Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she
F	ROXANNE	I have more than money to offer you. She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her
F	SOLOMON	What do you think you are doing? Do you have any idea who I am? I am the Witchfinder General. I have fought in the Holy Land. I have waded hip deep in blood and resisted all the temptations of the infidels. And you seek to stay the hand of justice with such a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl, before I have you whipped. Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
F	ROXANNE	Wait! I have something else! I know the name of a witch! Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
F	ROXANNE	Spare my brother and I will tell you her name. Then: A low MOAN in the dark. Isabelle startles. She
F	SOLOMON	How are you acquainted with the accused?
F	ROXANNE	We were friends.
F	SOLOMON	And how long did this friendship last?
F	ROXANNE	All my life.
F	SOLOMON	And in this time, have you ever known the accused to converse with devils?
F	ROXANNE	Yes, Your Eminence. On the night of the last full moon, she talked to the werewolf. And later she told me that it also talked to her. Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look. Cesaire
F	SOLOMON	What of this? Do you deny having conversed with a werewolf? She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:
M	ISABELLE	No. I do not deny it. The crowd REACTS. Solomon quiets them with a look.
F	SOLOMON	Describe this encounter.
M	ISABELLE	It spoke, just as a man speaks.
F	SOLOMON	And what was the nature of your conversation with it? Isabelle hesitates. Grandmother holds her breath.
M	ISABELLE	It told me... It promised to leave here and never return. But only if I leave with it. Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls
M	REEVE	But who is it? Make her tell us who the werewolf is!
M	ISABELLE	I don't know! I swear I don't know!
M	MERCHANT	It doesn't matter who it is anymore. It wants her, not us. Let's just give it what it wants. A long, tense beat. Heavy silence. Nobody speaks.
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	We should not allow ourselves to even consider this.
M	REEVE	I think we already are.
F	GRANDMOTHER	What's the matter with you? You know her. You all know her.
M	REEVE	Do we? Did we know she could talk to werewolves?
F	GRANDMOTHER	She could have run away. She could saved herself, but she stayed here because she cares more about you than she does herself. Peter reacts. He and Isabelle exchange a look. Now he
M	MERCHANT	If she stayed, she did so because she is in league with it. Let this be her punishment. The crowd loudly AGREES. Solomon considers. Grandmother
F	SOLOMON	Very well. Isabelle Ordeville, in light of your willing confession, it is the decision of this court that on the night of the next full moon, you be left to the mercy of the werewolf. Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands.
M	HENRI	No! Henri bursts to his feet, turning heads. Isabelle is led
M	LUCRECE	The first victim was her sister. The second was her fiancÃ©e's father. Then Rosemaria, who everyone knows she hated. And don't forget her mother, with half her face missing. All this death around one girl... Prudence has heard enough. She turns away.
F	ROXANNE	I'm here for my brother. He gestures. Roxanne turns... and sees Claude's body Roxanne falls to her knees. The rope around Claude's
F	GRANDMOTHER	I'm not going to let these worthless shits sacrifice you to save themselves. We have to find the real werewolf before tomorrow night.
M	ISABELLE	That's impossible. Even Father Solomon doesn't have the first clue.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Father Solomon doesn't know the things that I know. I am the oldest person in this village who was here when the Wolf first came. I remember the old days. And what is happening now is much worse.
M	ISABELLE	What was it like in the old days?
F	GRANDMOTHER	The Wolf never used to attack in the open like it did at the festival. It's a coward at heart. It would kill whole families in their homes, but it always stayed in the shadows. It never would have shown itself in the old days.
M	ISABELLE	It's grown bold.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Or perhaps it made a mistake. You're at the center of this. At least two of the victims can be tied to you. What if it had to kill so many at the festival to hide the fact that the first two killings weren't random? Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes...
M	ISABELLE	But who would want to kill Lucie?
F	GRANDMOTHER	Your parents said that the Wolf broke into the house and took Lucie. We both know that's not true. What really happened? Isabelle hesitates, reluctant.
M	ISABELLE	My mother made me swear I would never speak of it. Lucie went to the Wolf willingly. Grandmother reacts, horrified.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Why would you think such a thing?
M	ISABELLE	She was in love with Henri.
F	GRANDMOTHER	She took her own life over a boy?
M	ISABELLE	What other explanation is there? Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together...
F	GRANDMOTHER	Hello, Henri.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You spoke up very loudly in Isabelle's defense today. That was very brave.
M	HENRI	I just said what I felt.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You're under no obligation to stand in her defense. You broke off your engagement to her.
M	HENRI	I never stopped caring about her. I would do anything for Isabelle.
F	GRANDMOTHER	As her sister would have done anything for you. Lucie was in love with you. But you knew that, didn't you?
M	HENRI	I had no control over the way she felt.
F	GRANDMOTHER	She kept it secret from almost everyone. Even Isabelle didn't know. Did you tell anyone?
M	HENRI	Never.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Not even your father?
M	HENRI	I didn't have to tell him.
F	GRANDMOTHER	So he knew your secrets, did he? Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work. Angrily
F	GRANDMOTHER	You were the only one who could have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's night. And none of the men who went hunting for the Wolf remember seeing you after the sun set on the night your father died. Henri faces her, clutching the hammer...
M	HENRI	Why are you doing this?
F	GRANDMOTHER	Because I want you to confess. You killed Lucie. And your father. And God only knows how many others. And if you won't admit it, then I will tell Father Solomon and we will lock you up until the moon rises tomorrow night and you can no longer hide your guilt. As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization
M	HENRI	It's you. Henri steps closer to her, menacing. Grandmother steps
M	HENRI	My God, it's you. You're the Wolf. I can smell it on you now.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Smell what? What are you talking about?
M	HENRI	The night my father died. I saw the Wolf pass by, dragging him by the neck. I was so terrified I couldn't move or make a sound. I remember every detail of that moment. The way the moonlight gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The soundless way it moved. I even remember the way it smelled. A thick, greasy, musky stink. And I can smell it on you right now. A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You accuse me and I'll bring you down with me. All they can do is take my life. You have more to lose.
M	HENRI	But who do you think they'll believe? I'm the blacksmith.
M	HENRI (CONT'D)	They know me. You're the crazy old woman who lives in the woods.
F	GRANDMOTHER	Then I'll have to prove it.
M	HENRI	Unless you can, you'd best keep your mouth shut. Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the
M	CESAIRE	Are you ready for me to take you home? She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still
F	GRANDMOTHER	Stop the cart. Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out:
F	GRANDMOTHER	Prudence, come with me. I have some blankets I want you to mend for Father Auguste. Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart.
F	GRANDMOTHER	You take these blankets to Father Auguste the moment you're finished. Understand?
F	PRUDENCE	All right. Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart.
M	CESAIRE	Will you want a ride into town tomorrow? To say goodbye to her?
F	GRANDMOTHER	Yes. First thing in the morning.
M	HERALD	Full moon! Full moon! Full moon! ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
F	GRANDMOTHER	Show yourself! Coward! Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then: Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
M	THE FIGURE	Go away. Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.
F	PRUDENCE	Are you all right?
M	THE FIGURE	I'm sick. You can't come in.
F	PRUDENCE	You sound awful. Would you like us to make you something?
M	THE FIGURE	No. You mustn't come in. Go home, now. I want to sleep. The blood is flowing right toward the door. In about
F	ROXANNE	Are you sure you don't want us to bring you something?
M	THE FIGURE	No, my dear. Come back tomorrow. The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	I've come to hear your final confession. Isabelle nods shakily and sits up. He enters.
M	ISABELLE	Has there been any word from my grandmother?
M	FATHER AUGUSTE	None that I have heard. Why? Isabelle doesn't answer. She turns away, troubled...
M	SERVANT BOY	She's still in the dungeon. They're going to move her at sunset. Peter tosses the Boy a coin. The Boy runs off. Peter
M	ATTEWATER	We've hanged the werewolf. Why not let the girl go free?
F	SOLOMON	I told you, Bailiff. Where there is one werewolf, there are more. And the girl is the bait for our trap. Father Solomon strides off. Attewater watches him go...
M	PETER	I need your help. Off Henri's look...
M	ATTEWATER	Where is your mother?
M	CESAIRE	I don't know. I went to pick her up this morning and she was gone. Attewater reacts, concerned. Cesaire takes another
M	ATTEWATER	Stop pouring that swill down your gullet listen to me! Cesaire emerges from his drunken fog and shoots him a
M	ATTEWATER	She was trying to find the werewolf. If she figured out who it is, I need to know now. Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters,
M	ATTEWATER	Wait! What has he done?
M	CAPTAIN	It's just a precaution. Father Solomon doesn't want the girl's family interfering. Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits
M	ISABELLE	What have you done to him?! Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding Isabelle... He's coming to. Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers,
M	ISABELLE	I love you so much. Tell Mama and Grandmother that I love them.
M	CESAIRE	I love you, my angel. You don't know how much. The Soldiers pull Isabelle away and lead her up the
M	CESAIRE	Bastards!
M	LUCRECE	Not so pretty now, is she? The Villagers do not answer. Henri is here, silently
F	PRUDENCE	Where's Peter?
M	HENRI	I haven't seen him.
F	SOLOMON	We, Bailiff Attewater, Father Auguste, and Father Solomon of Avignon, having in mind that you, Isabelle Ordeville of Villiers la CroisÃ©e in the Diocese of Saint-
M	SOLOMON (CONT'D)	Flour, by your own confession, have committed acts of vulgar heresy, convict you of the sins of witches and condemn you to the mercy of werewolf. This is the sentence given. Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.
M	ISABELLE	Help... Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably
M	ISABELLE	Help me... Please... Help me... The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees
M	SOMEBODY HELP ME?!	The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling
F	PRUDENCE	Isabelle? Can you hear me?
M	ISABELLE	I can hear you.
F	PRUDENCE	Roxanne wanted you to know how sorry she is. She only said those things to save her brother.
M	ISABELLE	I know. Will you tell her that I forgive her?
F	PRUDENCE	Of course. I wanted to say... I don't know what to say.
M	ISABELLE	You don't have to say anything.
F	PRUDENCE	I want to. I want you to know that you may have fooled Roxanne, but you don't fool me. Not anymore. You were always too good. Too pretty. Nobody could be as perfect as you. You tricked us. And now you're going to get what you deserve. A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:
M	ISABELLE	I think you'd better go now. Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.
F	PRUDENCE	Yes. It won't be long now.
M	ACROSS THE SQUARE	The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
F	SOLOMON	No one shoots until I give the order. Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
F	SOLOMON	There. The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
F	SOLOMON	Hold your fire... Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
M	HENRI (O.S.)	Hey! Stop it! It's me! Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
M	ISABELLE	Get away from me!
M	HENRI	I'm not the Wolf! The moon is out! Look, I haven't turned! Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.
M	HENRI	I'm trying to get you out of this.
M	ISABELLE	Yes! Yes, please hurry! Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
M	CAPTAIN	He's going to free her. Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.
F	SOLOMON	Patience. It's close now... Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
M	HENRI	Can you stand? Isabelle nods. In the loft:
F	SOLOMON	Kill him. Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
M	RUN!	Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
M	HENRI	We have to get to the stable. Peter left his cart for us.
M	ISABELLE	Peter? Where is he --?
M	HENRI	It doesn't matter. Come on!
M	CAPTAIN	The witch has escaped! The witch has escaped!
M	HENRI	It's gone.
M	ISABELLE	I don't think so... Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
M	REEVE	Take her! Take her and leave us in peace! The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.
M	THE WOLF	You can't outrun me, my dear. And there is no place you can hide that I cannot smell you out. So what is your decision? Will you take your place with me?
M	ISABELLE	My place will never be with you.
M	THE WOLF	Where do you belong then? Here? With the cowards who so gladly sacrificed you to save themselves?
M	ISABELLE	They're still good people.
M	THE WOLF	They are sheep. We are not like them. Let me show you what you are. The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
M	HENRI	Get away from her! The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely, Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
M	HENRI	I need to tell you something. In case I die. Your grandmother is the Wolf. Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head.
M	ISABELLE	The Wolf is a man. It told me.
M	HENRI	You believe it? Isabelle hesitates. He has a point. Henri peers out.
M	HENRI	They're coming.
M	ISABELLE	Follow me. She takes his hand and leads him away.
M	ISABELLE	We need to come inside. Quickly.
F	MARGUERITE	Have you lost your mind? If they find her here, they'll kill us, too!
F	ROXANNE	Then shut up so they don't find her.
M	HENRI	We have to get out of town.
F	ROXANNE	You'll never make it. You can hide here until morning.
M	ISABELLE	They're searching everywhere. We have to keep moving.
F	ROXANNE	You might make it to the church. Even the king cannot violate the protection of sanctuary.
M	HENRI	And the Wolf cannot cross onto holy ground. The three exchange a look. Sounds like a plan.
M	ISABELLE	Can we go out your back window? Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then:
F	ROXANNE	Wait! I have an idea.
M	HENRI (O.S.)	Come on! The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that
M	REEVE	They're here! Over here! The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them.
M	HENRI	Can you keep going?
F	ROXANNE	I can if you can. They run off, chased by the Villagers.
M	CAPTAIN (O.S.)	There! The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
F	SOLOMON	At least you won't die alone now. Your friends will all hang with you. Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
F	SOLOMON	If you come for her, you come through me. The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
F	SOLOMON	Stay back! Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
M	THE WOLF	There is your mighty werewolf hunter. Who will save you now? Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her,
M	HENRI	You bastard! You killed my father!
M	ISABELLE	Henri, what are you doing?
M	HENRI	I'm not letting it take you. He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
M	HENRI	Look! It bleeds! We can kill it if we stand together! The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:
M	HENRI	Father Solomon was one man. His soldiers were mercenaries. But we are a village! The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.
M	ISABELLE	He's right. It's a coward at heart. Look at it. Why doesn't it attack? The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
M	MERCHANT	You killed my daughter! Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around. Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed
M	THE WOLF	I will come for you again. And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
M	HENRI	Are you all right? Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...
M	SOLOMON (O.S.)	This isn't over. They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.
F	SOLOMON	I am bitten. Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
M	ISABELLE	It's past noon.
F	SUZETTE	I know. I didn't want to wake you. Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
M	ISABELLE	Where's Father?
F	SUZETTE	He'll be home soon. They have no reason to hold him any longer.
M	ISABELLE	Did they catch the Wolf?
F	SUZETTE	No. They lost it in the forest. This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:
M	ISABELLE	What about Grandmother? Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.
F	SUZETTE	Roxanne came by. She said your grandmother has fallen ill. I was hoping you could look in on her. Off Isabelle's troubled look...
M	PETER	Thank God you're all right. He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.
M	ISABELLE	I'm fine. You sent Henri to help me.
M	PETER	What did he tell you? Isabelle gives him a hurt look.
M	ISABELLE	Those people back there. I know they mean well, but they're just people. I didn't expect anything from them. I expected something from you.
M	PETER	I just need to talk to you.
M	ISABELLE	I'm going to see my Grandmother. She's sick. Please don't follow me. Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there, ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks
M	ISABELLE	Grandmother? Are you awake? She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:
M	THE FIGURE (O.S.)	Pull the bobbin. The latch will open. We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,
M	REEVE	You're certain nobody has seen him since last night?
M	GUARD	The Wolf must have taken him. What else could have done that? They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.
M	THE FIGURE	I've been expecting you. Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket...
M	ISABELLE	Mother sent some food. There are cakes and a pot of butter --
M	THE FIGURE	Don't come in here. Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
M	THE FIGURE	I'm not hungry right now.
M	ISABELLE	Are you sure? You sound so weak.
M	THE FIGURE	I just made myself a stew. I left it over the fire for you. Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.
M	ISABELLE	I came here to take care of you. Not the other way around.
M	THE FIGURE	Don't be silly, my dear. You've been through so much. Sit down. Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
M	THE FIGURE	There's no burden so heavy that it doesn't seem a little lighter on a full stomach. You always say that. She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat
M	THE FIGURE	That's right. Eat up, my dear. Eat up. Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up
M	ISABELLE	I've been worried about you. When you didn't come back yesterday, I was afraid... You were wrong about Henri.
M	THE FIGURE	Was I now?
M	ISABELLE	Yes. He saved my life. Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She
M	ISABELLE	I feel hot all of a sudden.
M	THE FIGURE	It's just the stew warming you. Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
M	ISABELLE	What is this...?
M	THE FIGURE	If you don't like it, there's wine on the table to wash it down. Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
M	THE FIGURE	Oh, what pretty red lips. Come and give your Granny a kiss, my dear.
M	ISABELLE	I don't think I want to.
M	THE FIGURE	Then I will come to you. And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled.
M	ISABELLE	What is this? Where's Grandmother?
M	CESAIRE	I'm afraid I ate most of her. You ate the rest. Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified
M	CESAIRE	I didn't want to kill her. But she finally realized what I was.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	The hardest thing to hide has always been the smell. The werewolf musk is strong, especially close to the full moon. Henri smelled it the night he saw me. And he recognized the smell later. He thought it was your Grandmother. He didn't know he was smelling me. But she did. She'd lived with the smell her whole life, she just had no way of knowing what it was.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	Once she realized what it was, of course, she knew the truth. She tried to sneak a message to Father Auguste last night.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	Luckily, she'd taught me how to read.
M	BACK TO SCENE	Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face.
M	ISABELLE	You're not the Wolf. You can't be...
M	CESAIRE	Look into my eyes. The one part of me I can never change. Isabelle looks into his eyes... and recoils in horror.
M	ISABELLE	Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie? You killed my sister?
M	CESAIRE	I did more than that to her. Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling. He snarls.
M	CESAIRE	I only wish your mother could have known what I did to her. The girl she passed off as my daughter.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	I was made a cuckold by your mother. But I paid her back. She hears a LOW GROWL. She turns, startled. It's the
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	I paid her lover back, too.
M	BACK TO SCENE	To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes.
M	CESAIRE	Lucie was the joy of my life. But she wasn't mine.
M	ISABELLE	Yes, she was. In every way that matters, she was.
M	CESAIRE	No. Not in every way that matters. My father sired me. I am a werewolf because it was in his blood. Because I was his.
M	ISABELLE	Did Grandmother know?
M	CESAIRE	No. And neither does your mother.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	I put an herb in the beer to make you sleep whenever the moon was full. One of your Grandmother's old remedies.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	That's how my father got away with it. Your grandmother never learned the truth. Until last night.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	I began to turn when I was fourteen. My father and I ran together. We hunted freely. Killing at will. The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT,
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	Our only mistake was that we gorged ourselves too often on the fat flesh of the villagers.
M	CESAIRE	They killed my father. Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled By the time the Villagers reach the pit, what they find
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	The fools thought my father had been thrown in the pit by the Wolf. They never suspected that he was the Wolf.
M	SERIES OF SHOTS (FLASHBACK)	Cesaire labors in a field. He goes to church. He
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	I tried to live as my father did, but I came to realize that I did not belong here. The Wolf was my true self. It wasn't something to be hidden. It was a gift. I had to leave here and never return. But I did not want to go alone. My father and I were part of a long and powerful bloodline. It was up to me to see that it did not die out. I had hoped for a son to pass my gift on to.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	Instead, God gave me daughters. He's looking at Lucie and Isabelle. They help Suzette
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	But female werewolves are not born. They are made. And I chose my eldest. Lucie catches him watching. She waves. He waves back.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	When I finally decided to leave, I told Lucie the truth. And I gave her a choice. She could come with me. Or I would take you instead. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle approaching. We realize
M	CESAIRE	This doesn't concern you, Isabelle.
M	ISABELLE	Yes, Father. Isabelle walks away. Cesaire watches her go...
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	She agreed to come with me. She did it to protect you. We arranged to meet on the night of the next full moon.
M	CESAIRE	She was not a werewolf yet. I had to turn her. ... the Wolf emerge from the forest with a scrap of
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	First, she had to eat human flesh. I fed her from a kill I had made the month before. But the ritual was not yet complete. She had to be bitten by a male werewolf.
M	CESAIRE	The bite should have changed her. It should have made her like me. But it didn't. That's when I knew. There was no werewolf blood in her. I was not her father. I was so angry. I killed her before I even realized I was doing it.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	Afterwards, I thought about killing myself. The only thing that kept me alive was you.
M	CESAIRE (V.O.)	You were so beautiful. So kind. And I knew you were mine. That's why you could understand me when no one else could. You were mine.
M	CESAIRE	Do you see now? This is your heritage. This is what you are. Everything I have done has been to insure the future of our bloodline. We will run together like my father and I once did. You are the next generation. You have had your first taste of human flesh. Now one bite from me is all that is needed to change you. It will only hurt for a moment. And then you will be as I am.
M	ISABELLE	There must indeed be a God. For you are surely the Devil...
M	CESAIRE	I will give you a choice. Come with me now. Or refuse me and let your friends suffer in your place. I will kill them one by one. Your mother. Roxanne. Peter. Isabelle shudders. She slowly pulls away and he releases
M	ISABELLE	Father...? He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand
M	CESAIRE	Yes, my dear?
M	ISABELLE	You gave me two choices. She turns to face him. Looks up at him.
M	ISABELLE	But I have thought of a third. Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into
M	PETER (O.S.)	Hello? No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he
M	ISABELLE	People should know what he was.
M	PETER	We can't tell anyone. If they don't believe you, they'll hang you for this. And if they do believe you, they'll hang you for being the daughter of the Wolf.
M	ISABELLE	Then I'll run away. I was ready to run away last night. Why didn't you come for me? Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he
M	PETER	I was bitten at the festival. I spent last night in the woods because I was afraid of what might happen... I changed. I'm like him now.
M	ISABELLE	No, you're not. You could never be like him. Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's
M	PETER	I can't stay here.
M	ISABELLE	Yes, you can. We can still be together. My father lived here. My grandfather lived here.
M	PETER	Your father and your grandfather killed people. They couldn't help themselves. If I stay here, I won't be able to control myself. I have to be alone. Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like
M	PETER	We could take him to the river.
M	ISABELLE	I don't want him ever found.
M	PETER	We'll weight him with rocks.
M	ISABELLE	No. We'll put the rocks inside him. Cut him open. I will sew the rocks inside him. Peter is taken aback. She's serious.
M	CONTINUED:	Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly
M	ISABELLE	Wait. She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.
M	ISABELLE	These belonged to my grandmother. The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes
M	PETER	They're silver.
M	PETER	Death was too good for him.
M	ISABELLE	I can live with it.
M	ISABELLE	Where will you go?
M	PETER	I don't know. I need to understand what I've become. Maybe I can learn to control it. I'll take my own life before I take another's.
M	ISABELLE	I know.
M	PETER	I'm not coming back. I don't want you to wait for me. This is the last time you'll ever see me.
M	ISABELLE	No, it isn't. You'll be in my dreams until the day I die. Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.
M	PETER	You know, Henri is a good man.
M	ISABELLE	Yes, he is. Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	I never saw him again.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	Life in my village was changed forever. There were many questions and few answers. In the
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)	end, the Wolf did not return. And that was answer enough for most.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	Henri and I were married. He was a good man and a good father. I loved him very much. But I never loved him the same way that I loved Peter. That was the one secret in our marriage.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	I only tell you now because he is dead. And if he knows now, I believe that he forgives me, for he must also know that I never loved him falsely.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	This is my story, not that I expect you will believe it. In my own village, the events of that awful winter have already passed into legend. Parents tell their children to be good or else the Wolf will come and gobble them up. Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	They've already forgotten. A simple children's story is all that remains.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	But sometimes, when the moon is full, my thoughts still turn to Peter. He promised me that I would never see him again. And I never have. Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.
M	OLD WOMAN (V.O.)	But I often wonder if I hear him. It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we
