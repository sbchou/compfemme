F	JUSTINE	Then I don't know... He's already half an hour late.
F	HANNA	He gonna show? Or the son of a bitch gonna stand her up like last time?
F	JUSTINE	Want the coffee?
F	HANNA	I'm out of time...
F	JUSTINE	Falls back on the pillow, disappointed. It's as if she'd been stood-up. The bed sheet falls half off of her. She's exposed, vulnerable. She looks out the window, occluded by light muslin, away from us and exhales.
M	CERRITO	You Waingro?
M	WAINGRO	Yeah.
M	WAINGRO	You're Cerrito huh? What kinda guy is this Neil?
M	CERRITO	Okay.
M	WAINGRO	You guys always work together?
M	CERRITO	All the time.
M	WAINGRO	Real tight crew, huh?
M	CERRITO	That's right.
M	WAINGRO	This works good, maybe I could go again?
M	CERRITO	Yeah. Stop talking, slick...
M	NEIL (V.O.)	You ready if I need you?
M	TOWNER	Yeah.
M	NEIL (V.O.)	Got their air?
M	TOWNER	Yeah.
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER	...Daddio's jazz patio on KDCA. Brought to you this fine day, which is A-okay, by Twister. Hey, mister, go out and buy a bottle of that Twister...Wiiiiiine...
M	NEIL	Turn it off.
M	CERRITO	Time.
M	CHRIS	Their response time?
M	NEIL	Two minutes, fifty seconds.
M	NEIL (V.O.)	We ought to be down the chute into the escape route in 2:20. Here we go...
M	GUARD #1	211! We're being taken down!
M	DISPATCHER (V.O.)	Car 74, what's your ETA to the 211 in progress Hoover and 14th? Over.
M	CAR 74 (V.O.)	Car 74. Three minutes. Over.
M	DISPATCHER (V.O.)	Car 74. Take it. Car 37, you're back-up. Car...
M	TOWNER	There's the call. Three minutes.
M	NEIL	Next one blows you up! Out! Now... Now!
M	NEIL	Up against the wall!
M	NEIL	8o seconds left. Move it.
M	WAINGRO	Flatten - up against it! Higher!
M	GUARD TWO	...you didn't have that gun..
M	WAINGRO	What?!
M	CERRITO	That's true, slick, cause you're a real tough guy. But he has the gun. And me, too. So shut the fuck up.
M	NEIL	Move out! 38 seconds left! ...hadda mouth off? In front of them?
M	NEIL	Ten. Nine. Blew the margin. Here we come.
M	TOWNER	One on your tail.
M	NEIL	Here we come.
M	NATE	A million, six at 40 cents onna dollar's 640. Here's a hundred forty thou front money. Get you the rest, 2-3 days.
M	NATE	What happened out there?
M	NEIL	I don't want to talk about it.
M	NATE	Wait a minute.
M	NEIL	What's the matter?
M	NATE	You know who these belong to?
M	NEIL	"Malibu Securities ...
M	NATE	You know John Van Zant?
M	NEIL	No.
M	NATE	Malibu Securities is a brokerage he controls. Planned bankruptcies, made out during the S&L;'s, money laundering...
M	NATE	You ripped off his Treasury Certificates.
M	NEIL	So what?
M	NATE	That's the point. On top of collecting his insurance, maybe he wants to buy back his bonds. From him I can get you 60 cents on the dollar instead of 40. Means an extra 320 to you.
M	NEIL	Try it on.
M	NATE	You know Cezar Kelso?
M	NEIL	By reputation.
M	NATE	He's got this score he's putting out and wants you to look at. What do I need look at his score for? I got my own.
M	NATE	He said you'll get near eight figures. Very clean.
M	NEIL	9:00a.M. tomorrow.
M	NATE	Take it easy.
M	HANNA (O.S.)	Where's the ambulance?
M	HEINZ (O.S.)	They dumped it four blocks from here...
M	HEINZ	Masks, guns, radios - all left behind. No prints.
F	HANNA	What about the crash, the white towtruck.
M	HEINZ	Hasn't turned up. Got a witness: janitor next door.
F	HANNA	I.D. anybody? Plate? Description?
M	HEINZ	Shhaaapes ... One big. One thin. He heard it...
F	HANNA	What about them?
M	DRUCKER	According to the janitor, he... Started mouthing off to one of the gunmen.
F	HANNA	Oh, that was smart.
M	DRUCKER	I figure the other went for... ... that gun when the shooting started. One guy called a guard "slick."
F	HANNA	"Slick?"
M	DRUCKER	Yeah. And they ignored the loose cash.
F	HANNA	'Cause they had no time, cause they knew our response time, cause they were on our air.
M	HEINZ	You recognize their m.o.?
F	HANNA	Yeah. Their m.o. is that they are good. Once it escalated into a Murder One beef for all of them after they killed the first two, they popped guard number three 'cause it didn't rake any difference anymore, so why leave a living witness? Drop of a hat? They'll rock and roll. Also: the way they went into the side indicates they are equipped to go in on the prowl. So also start looking for recent highline burgularies that have 'mystified' us. Run the "slick" bit to the FBI and see what it kicks out.
M	DRUCKER	I called it in already.
F	HANNA	Split the fences. I'll take Cuzomano and Torena. You take the East side. Go through the tapes of who we been listening to. Hang in with Forensics on all physical evidence. How'd they know the route of the van and what it was carrying? Does Gage print the day's routes? What do they do with the printouts? Who collects their trash? Run makes on all their middlemanagement. Did someone give this score up? Check the three guards. See if one of them was a tipster.
F	BOSKO	What's the vibe: home-grown or out-of-town?
F	HANNA	Out-of-town. Frankly, I hope they are scoring once and passing through. And I doubt it.
M	HEINZ	This going to stay in Area?
F	HANNA	This look like boosters working the local Seven Eleven to you? It goes to Major Crime. Go to work.
M	WAINGRO	Anybody want some pie?
M	NEIL	This is a partial split, but I took out of ours - every - to make up... ...his full end. Because I want to settle him up and get rid of this jagoff right now.
M	CERRITO	Okay.
M	NEIL	Fuck off.
M	WAINGRO	I had to dust him!
M	NEIL	Electricity and chemicals a little fucked up? You a shooter? Speed? What?
M	NEIL	You didn't have to. Now we got extra heat off a clean score.
M	CERRITO	Hold it.
F	CHARLENE	Where's the rest?
M	CHRIS	That's it.
F	CHARLENE	Eight thousand dollars? You gotta be kidding me!
M	CHRIS	I squared the bookies and we had to pay off some guy and were short to start 'cause the rest is comin', in a coupla days. So don't sweat it. We're late.
F	CHARLENE	Listen to me. "As The World Turns" can get interrupted with a news flash of you splattered all over the street ...
F	CHARLENE	I can get sent up on an accessory beef. Your son, Dominick, winds up in a home. For $8,000? Honey, for $8,000, it ain't worth the risk. Risk versus reward? Baby?
M	CHRIS	Don't worry about money. Neil's got... Hey, if we're goin', let's go.
F	CHARLENE	Where's the club you were going to open?
M	CHRIS	Here comes the "showgirl with a future" bit.
M	CHARLEJ	Shut up! I left for a good thing. Why am I even talking to you? I can't talk to you. All you are is a child growin' older...
M	CHRIS	The hell's that mean?
F	CHARLENE	It means we're not making forward progress like real adults and you won't listen.
M	CHRIS	I told you: me and Neil got planned ...
F	CHARLENE	"Me and Neil." I'm married to you, now. This isn't the fucking joint.
M	CHRIS	Don't mouth off to me!
F	CHARLENE	I want out of here!
M	CHRIS	Well there's the fucking door! Only leave Dominick, the bank book and the car keys on the kitchen table!
F	CHARLENE	You can keep that other crap! But Dominick goes with me.
M	CHRIS	I'll find ya and kill you, you bitch, wherever you are - you ever try to take Dominick away from me.
M	ANITA (O.S.)	Daddy, daddy!
F	ELAINE	Hungry?
M	CERRITO	Starving.
F	ELAINE	You okay?
M	CERRITO	Put this away.
F	ANITA	Daddy, what's in the box?
M	CERRITO	What do you care?
M	CERRITO	Open it up.
M	EADY (0. C.)	Help you with something?
M	NEIL	No thanks.
M	NEIL	You closing in a few minutes?
F	EADY	Yeah. Excuse me. You interested in metals?
M	NEIL	No. It's the color reproduction of these plates...
F	EADY	We have a first edition of Kandinsky's Theory of Color with hand pulled lithographic prints bound in. Would you like see it?
M	NEIL	Sure.
F	EADY	I see you in here before.
M	NEIL	You're open late. Not many open this late. What's your name?
F	EADY	Eady. Eady Tse. What's yours?
M	NEIL	Bukowski. Neil Bukowski.
M	CASALS (V.O.)	M. C. U.
F	HANNA	Bobby, it's me.
M	CASALS (V.O.)	Boss, whoever's fencing the Bearer Bonds is either highline or out- of-town. Everyone's talking about it. No one knows about it. Schwartz went through the indexes on recent surveillance tapes? No armored cars. No witnesses on who stole the ambulance.
F	HANNA	Albert Torena call me back? No.
F	HANNA	Hi.
F	JUSTINE	Where have you been?
F	HANNA	Work. Harvey show or'd Lauren get stood up again?
F	JUSTINE	He didn't even call her.
F	HANNA	What an asshole. She okay?
F	JUSTINE	She's been in her room all day and won't talk. So "no," she's not okay. And neither am I. If I try to create something like a mood between us you back away. I made a great dinner for us. That was four hours ago. At least get yourself a plate...
F	HANNA	There's three dead bodies in an alley off Adams. I'm really sorry the lamb got overcooked.
F	HANNA	Looking after her is tired. Very tired. He doesn't know why he said what he did. He regrets it. So he turns on his TV to watch the news and his eyes glaze over.
F	EADY	What do you do?
M	NEIL	Swimming pools. Institutional. Schools, State, counties. I'm on the sales end. Let me have another coffee. You like selling books?
F	EADY	Yeah. Especially fine art books. I study them.
M	NEIL	Yeah? Like what?
M	NEIL	Tell me.
F	EADY	There's a Skira edition of Delacroix charcoal sketches, I like...
M	NEIL	What else?
F	EADY	Asian art work.
M	EADY (V.O.)	The plates are mezzotints. They evoke a feeling Japanese painters called "sabi". They believed there were eight scenes of transcendental loneliness. They painted them over and over again. One is a flock of geese hovering over a field. There's always mist. It's painted just as the leader touches down.
M	NEIL	City of lights.
F	EADY	Yeah.
M	NEIL	I flew over the arctic once at 40,000 feet. The moonlight was blue on all the snow. It felt like that.
F	EADY	Do you travel a lot?
M	NEIL	Yeah.
F	EADY	Are you lonely?
M	NEIL	I'm alone. Not lonely.
M	NEIL	You?
F	EADY	I get lonely.
F	HANNA	You were supposed to get back to me last night. So where the fuck were you, Albert?
M	ALBERT	I couldn't break free, man!
F	HANNA	I oughta violate your ass right now.
M	ALBERT	I was all night hitting up Los vatos like one of those flamenco matador guys. Cuttin' in real smooth. Generating leads and shit. I'm a dancer, man!
F	HANNA	You're a bust-out speed freak jackin' metamphetamine again. I'm in a hurry.
M	ALBERT	You talk to my brother, Raoul. He meet you tonight at...
F	HANNA	No. Right now.
M	ALBERT	I implore him, man. But he say "no." He in Phoenix. Tonight's the best I can do for you. The Zebra on Crenshaw. Eleven o'clock.
F	HANNA	You be there, too.
M	ALBERT	Mon, I go
F	HANNA	Be there!
M	CEZAR	first, but don't think you're the only action in town and I'm giving it away. 'Cause I'm not.
M	NEIL	What is it?
M	CEZAR	A bank. On Thursdays it gets cash deposits for distribution to other branches. The branches have to buttress their cash accounts to handle Friday payroll checks from a Toyota and Nissan plant, a steel mill and two refineries. One day a week, Thursday, the main branch carries the full whack.
M	NEIL	You want a $100,000 advance, against a full 101. Why?
M	CEZAR	'Cause I can get it. 'Cause this is the best thing I seen in three years. 'Cause a screw-up makes 10 percent of nothin' equal nothin'. And 'cause those are the terms and they ain't negotiable.
M	NEIL	On the prowl or strong?
M	CEZAR	Strong. Through the front door. During the day.
M	NEIL	How many guys?
M	CEZAR	Four. Three plus a driver.
M	NEIL	That's not a $100,000 worth anything. You're giving me an address to what's strictly a cowboy score: "Get the guns and let's go!" We smash, grab and boogie while they hit the alarm.
M	CEZAR	Three alarms. And that's why the price. 'Cause you chop-in through the roof the night before on the prowl and bypass 'em. I got circuit diagrams, blue prints, the works. So yeah, they hit the alarms, but nothing gonna happen.
M	NEIL	Do I have to kill people?
M	CEZAR	I doubt it. Two men have the two keys to open the box.
M	NEIL	Full architectural, plumbing and electric, camera placements?
M	CEZAR	All of it.
M	NEIL	What do you estimate?
M	CEZAR	Eight point, one. Eight point, two million dollars.
M	CEZAR	Where's Nate?
M	NEIL	He hadda make a call. You're on. Here's five grand earnest money. You get the rest after lunch.
M	NATE	Look, Van Zant. Nobody knew the merch was yours or they would have respected it. Be that as it may: now you get 100% from the insurance company and you're even, plus you can get the bonds back for 60 cents onna dollar. You make an additional 40%. Your operation doesn't skip a beat, and everybody's making out.
M	VAN ZANT	Sure. You got a deal.
M	NATE (0. S.)	Good. Cause there's no percentage in everybody getting their underwear in a twist over this.
M	VAN ZANT	Absolutely. You have your man call me to set the meet.
M	NATE (O.S.)	Usually I'm the mailman.
M	VAN ZANT	I don't want to involve extra people. What the fuck do I want all kinds of people meeting each other for?
M	NATE (O.S.)	Okay.
M	VAN ZANT	Nice talking to you... Van Zant hangs up. He's a tall avuncular man with a flabby belly and Arrow shirts: an accountant. HUGH BENNY, a very large juice collector, is in the office.
M	HUGH	You gonna deal with these people?
M	VAN ZANT	So word hits the streets it's okay to steal my stuff? I'm gonna kill the sonsa-bitches.
M	NEIL	I bought it.
M	NATE	What I tell you?
M	NEIL	The bonds?
M	NATE	We're on. You call him tomorrow... ... and set a meet.
M	NEIL	How is he?
M	NATE	Very cool. He's a businessman.
F	LILLIAN	Here it is. You okay?
M	BREEDAN	Don 't worry, baby. Gonna do good.
M	BREEDAN	I'm Breedan. You Solenko?
M	SOLENKO	Yeah. Fucking hillbilly grill ran didn't show. Been here since 4:30. You know this kinda operation?
M	BREEDAN	The grill. Yeah.
M	SOLENKO	Grill? Empty the garbage, mopout the toilets. You gimme a hard time, I'll find something to violate you back and blow your parole. You kick back 25% of your salary to me under the table. Grierson your parole officer? Right?
M	BREEDAN	Yeah.
M	SOLENKO	Check it out. Change in the back. Hurry up.
M	HANNA (0 .S.)	Cuzomano. Open up.
F	HANNA	Whaddaya hear, whaddaya say?.
M	CUZOMANO	Hiya, Vincent. About what?
F	HANNA	About this crew that knocked down three guards yesterday and took a Gates Armored truck. Bearer Bonds. Start making calls.
M	CUZOMANO	It's Cuzomano. Get me Francis. How'd I hear about this?
F	HANNA	Ridin' the airwaves. On every news channel. Turn on a fucking radio! Try to broker the Bonds. Make some money. Then you'll shift into Flip-o-matic and tell me who they are. And what they are doing next.
M	CUZOMANO	Hey, Francis! That score went down yesterday? Yeah, I'm lookin' to handle all or a piece of the merch. All I got are yo-yo's. One brings me a container of Armani suits? He didn't know they were knockoffs. Schmuck stole knockoffs. They should make stupidity a felony. You hear who they been downed to?
M	CHARLENE (V.O.)	Hello?
M	NEIL	Chris is here. I called so you shouldn't worry. What's wrong?
F	CHARLENE	Husband and wife stuff. That's all. He can sleep it off here.
F	CHARLENE	Thanks, Neil.
M	NEIL	What happened to you?
M	CHRIS	When you going to get some furniture?
M	NEIL	When I get around to it.
M	CHRIS	My mouth tastes like a sewer.
M	CHRIS	Charlene's going to leave me.
M	NEIL	Why?
M	CHRIS	There ain't no steaks in the freezer.
M	NEIL	With everything we been taking?
M	CHRIS	Last trip to Vegas and the Superbowl took care of that. When you gonna get an old lady?
M	NEIL	When I get around to it. You got something else on the side?
M	CHRIS	Nothing regular.
M	NEIL	She got another man?
M	CHRIS	No.
M	NEIL	You sure?
M	CHRIS	Yeah, I'm sure.
M	NEIL	Jimmy - whatsisname - Bohunk, in the joint used to say: "On the street you wanna be makin' roves, you don't put anything in your life you can't walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot heat around the corner."
M	CHRIS	Jimmy Banghart. And to hell with Jimmy Banghart. I'd rather go ten rounds with Jesus Christ than fuck with her. But she and Dominick save my life, man; everyday. Everyday...
M	NEIL	So?
M	CHRIS	So.
M	NEIL	Taking delivery from Van Zant on the rest of the armored car cash. I gotta drop a deposit on Kelso. He's got a bank score.
M	CHRIS	What about the platinum? It's ready to fall ...
M	NEIL	That goes, too. Meet me at the coffee shop at noon. I got stuff to do...
M	MARCIANO	Hello?
F	CHARLENE	Alan.
M	MARCIANO (V.O.)	Hey!
F	CHARLENE	I've had it with him. I've had it. Can you get us out of here?

F	EADY	I was worried... was just... ...the one night. You know?
M	NEIL (V.O.)	Not for me it wasn't.
F	EADY	Me either. Tonight. I'll pick you up at work.
M	NEIL	Change for a dollar?
M	COOK	There you go, honey.
M	TELEPHONIST (V.O.)	Malibu Securities.
M	NEIL	Yeah. Van Zant.
M	VAN ZAPT (V.O.)	Yes?
M	NEIL	About the merchandise. What's the story?
M	VAN ZANT (V.O.)	Give me your number and somebody will call you right back from a different line to set the meet.
M	NEIL	
M	CHARLENE (O.S.)	Yes?
M	NEIL	Open up.
M	NEIL	Who was that guy?
F	CHARLENE	I won't tell you.
M	NEIL	Listen...
M	NEIL	We got to know who he is!
F	CHARLENE	Nobody, Neil! A liquor wholesaler from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.
M	NEIL	What he tell you? How connected he is? Get you a spot in a show?
F	CHARLENE	I figured it out for myself!
M	NEIL	Chris is gonna straighten it up with you. And you ...
F	CHARLENE	It's too late! I'm sick of it! I'm sick of you.
M	NEIL	I'm not part of your situation!
M	NEIL	Not anymore. And Chris has got two big jobs back-to-bick. You will give Chris this shot. After that, he fucks up, then okay. I will finance setting you up, separate, myself. Dominick will go with you. And my word counts. But right now he is puttin' it all on the line. So for the three of you, you are goin', to give Chris one more shot.
M	NEIL	Now that is what it is gonna be
F	CHARLENE	All right.
M	HANNA (O.S.)	Gimme all your money!
M	ALPHONSE	Cuz, one day you get coldblasted with that shit.

F	HANNA	...lookin' for me to rid you of your competition?
M	RAOUL	I'm a good citizen.
F	HANNA	You got something to say, or what?
M	RAOUL	Mi carnal: if I tell you what I got to tell you, how do I know you gonna do what the fuck I just told you I need to get done?

F	HANNA	You can get killed ... walking down the street...
M	RAOUL	A dude I knew in McNeil's been out a couple, three years.
F	HANNA	Yeah?
M	RAOUL	He's an action junkie. If he'd said nothin', I'd a thought nothin'. But he goes on and on into extra overtime on how he ain't been do-in' nothin' and then I know this cat's got something goin' down...
F	HANNA	What's wrong with you? You drag me here to waste my time like this? You saw a guy on the street... who's an ex-con?
M	RAOUL	Yeah.
F	HANNA	...what do you expect for that? A Junior G-Man badge?
M	RAOUL	You gonna make the call on the Porsches?
F	HANNA	Are you kidding?
M	RAOUL	I'm telling you this slick is double-duty! A real doubleblank mo-fo.
F	HANNA	What?
M	RAOUL	Huh ... ?
F	HANNA	You said "slick."
M	RAOUL	Yeah, that's what he calls people. "Slick."
F	HANNA	Tell me about him...
M	RAOUL	Six feet, built. Lotta jailhouse tattoos. Peacock right here. Probably was a shooter once Heavy time: Attica, Marion, could do a nickel or dine standing on his
M	RAOUL (CONT'D)	ear. He's in C-block two days, and in the shower some Muslim comes up into his face and he cuts the guy a new opening for a colostomy bag and goes back to shampooing his hair...
F	HANNA	What's his ... name..

F	BOSKO	Richie the Medical Examiner's holding.

F	HANNA	Homicide getting anywhere?
M	RICHIE	Nowhere.

M	NEIL	You keep your hands in sight! I tell you what to do, how to do it.
M	DRIVER	Yessir. I'm just the delivery boy.
M	REAR SHOTS	Of the two vehicles. Out of the covered bed of the pick-up a small man slowly slips out.
M	NEIL	Now, with your right hand only: throw the envelope in my back seat.
M	GUNMAN	Can I Make it?
M	NEIL	You're all done, pal.
M	GUNMAN	Do it.
M	NEIL (O.S.)	John Van Zant?
M	VAN ZANT	Yeah. Who's this?
M	NEIL (O.S.)	Neil McCauley.
M	VAN ZANT	This kid I sent to straighten you up on the money... didn't call. Is ... uh... everything alright?
M	NEIL	Tell you what: keep the money.
M	VAN ZANT	What?
M	NEIL	"... keep ... the ... money."
M	VAN ZANT	It's a lot of money! What are you doing?
M	NEIL	What am I doin' I'm talking into an empty telephone.
M	VAN ZANT	I don't understand.
M	NEIL	'Cause there is a dead man on the other end of this line...
M	VAN ZANT	Who are these people? Huh?!
M	KELSO (V.O.)	Yeah?
M	NEIL	You got a clean line?
M	KELSO	Yeah.
M	NEIL (V.O.)	(Phone filter) I got a delay dropping the $50,000.
M	KELSO	You don't have a delay. What you don't have is a deal. Swing by and collect your envelope sometime. Goodbye.
M	NEIL (V.O.)	Wait a minute, pal-o!!
M	NEIL	You're going to wait for me for a week. I'll buy a week with the five. It's above and beyond the fifty and if I wash, you keep it. You're going to wait for me 'cause you want me to take it down. You know it's got better odds with me in. Now do we have an understanding?
M	KELSO (V.O.)	Seven days.
M	VOICES	...Happy anniversary to you. Happy anniversary dear Michael and Elaine. Happy anniversary to you.
M	NEIL	We'll down platinum through Nate. The deal is 72% of today's quote on the Bourse in the New York Times.
M	CERRITO	You got the black boxes for the alarms?
M	CHRIS	Yeah. Towner delivered. They're in the drop.
M	NEIL	We pass by couple times tomorrow afternoon. Check nothing strange in the neighborhood. Tomorrow night: we take it down. You set on the rear door.
M	CHRIS	I'm going to punch it... What do we do about Van Zant?
M	NEIL	Kill him...after the score.
M	CHRIS	Kelso?
M	NEIL	We'll use Nate's advance off the platinum when I down the merch to pay Kelso for the bank package.
M	CHRIS	You okay?
F	CHARLENE	I'm fine.
M	CHRIS	Makin' it happen this time...
F	CHARLENE	I hope so. I really hope so.
M	MICHAEL	Hey!
M	CHRIS	Let me have it!
M	NEIL	I got it.
M	HANNA (O.S.)	A goddamn convention.
M	CASALS (O.S.)	Who's "slick?"
M	DRUCKER	Cerrito, the wide one. He's hugged twice. One if he finds it behind the wheel wall. The back-up's in the firewall. We got their plates.
M	CASALS	Yeah.
M	DRUCKER	One with the hair is Shiherlis. Got a revolving tail and a tap on the house phone.
F	HANNA	Who's the big guy?
M	DRUCKER	First time we're seeing him.
F	HANNA	Next time this crew scores? When they walk in that door? They will get the surprise of a lifetime.
M	NEIL	Come away with me.
F	EADY	What? Where?
M	NEIL	New Zealand.
F	EADY	When?
M	NEIL	Soon.
F	EADY	You're kidding.
M	NEIL	What's stopping you? What's here?
F	EADY	I don't know you.
M	NEIL	What's to know?
F	EADY	Are you married?
M	NEIL	Why?
F	EADY	Way you come and go.
M	NEIL	I deal with state officials. County. Weird hours. A lot of traveling, entertaining. The last thing I am is married.
F	EADY	You don't know me at all, Neil...
M	NEIL	I know enough.
F	EADY	My father wanted me to marry someone in Taipei. It was like I was a piece of furniture: "Go be his wife." After I left he won't talk to me. Because I went on my own. I can't let people tell roe what to do again. And that trust comes from knowing someone over time. This is hard between us for me. Because I like you very much.
M	NEIL	I have to leave. Come away with me. No one will ever tell you what to do... You'll never lose yourself with me.
M	PROSTITUTE	Hey, baby.
M	WAINGRO	Showed you a good time? Huh?
M	PROSTITUTE	Oh, yeah. You fly. You cool.
M	WAINGRO	Don't lie to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.
M	PROSTITUTE	I ain't lyin'! You a hot dog. You a cowboy. You hung like a horse and this was the monster fuck of my young life. Now I gotta get my ass streetside.
M	WAINGRO	You don't have a truth-telling style.
M	PROSTITUTE	The fuck's wrong with you?
M	WAINGRO	You think I'm some john? I'm a stone killer! I'm a sky-blue bad ass, bitch!
M	BARTENDER	Once again?
M	WAINGRO	Sure, good buddy. Set it up.
M	WAINGRO	I'm looking to get into something.
M	BARTENDER	Yeah? Where you been?
M	WAINGRO	Chino, Tracy. I'm a cowboy, heavy-hitter. Billy Ricketts said to come see you.
M	BARTENDER	Go see this guy. This guy always putting guys on.
M	WAINGRO	Thanks.
F	LILLIAN	Get your fucking hand off my arm!
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Hey, hey! ...there, old aware ones, and you, too, my fair ones. When tears are falling like rain the groove is strictly Col-trane...
M	BREEDAN	Hey!
M	LILLIAN (O.S.)	Let's go, baby.
M	BREEDAN	I got any left?
F	LILLIAN	There's other paychecks. You blow it off. It's worth it, baby, cause you mess with that man and you be violated right back to San Quentin. So you got to handle it 'til we get you a different job.
M	BREEDAN	Yeah. That motherfucker ain't invented the hard time this gangster can't handle!. Why you stickin' with me, Lillian? Why?
F	LILLIAN	'Cause I'm proud of you. Proud you my man.
M	BREEDAN	Proud of me? What you proud of me for?
F	LILLIAN	Come on home.
M	BRUCE	Okay. Captain Jackson wants to know what's goin' on.
F	HANNA	Nothing. Clear the air.
M	JACKSON	Where'd...they...go?
F	HANNA	Fell back to see if the alarm bypasses held. If they did, they'll be back. Stay the fuck off the radio!
F	HANNA	Quiet! !
M	NEIL	...We walk.
M	CHRIS	I'm 60 seconds away. It's a rat or something.
M	NEIL	It is not an animal sound. We are out of here.
M	CHRIS	We need the cash!!
M	NEIL	We walk!! Now.
M	JACKSON	They're leaving. Why are they leaving?!
M	JACKSON (O.S.)	I can take 'em, now! Let 'em go.
M	JACKSON (V.O.)	At least we got 'em on a...
F	HANNA	Let em go. We got nothing! Not even a burglary. They didn't fucking steal anything yet. Don't you get it? All we've got's breaking and entry.
M	JACKSON (V.O.)	I'm not letting them walk!
F	HANNA	The fuck you aren't! That's exactly what you are gonna do. It's my investigation. And my authority supersedes your rank! And I am not settling for some chicken shit misdemeanor!
F	HANNA	Back to work.
M	MARCIANO	What can I do for you guys? Ignores his hand and shoves him back into his office chair with an open hand.
M	MARCIANO	L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think you're pushing around? You got no jurisdiction and I know people here!
M	SCHWARTZ	Who? The fucking Tooth Fairy! So what?
F	HANNA	You go back to Newark on a New Jersey warrant for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago or you go to work for us. Cut and dried. That...is...it.
M	MARCIANO	Oh, my God...
F	HANNA	Charlene Shiherlis.
M	MARCIANO	Who?
M	SCHWARTZ	"Who?" The stranger you been talkin' dirty to on the telephone every day for the last month.
M	MARCIANO	You can't tie me to her!
F	HANNA	Who has to. You're onna plane to New Jersey, jagoff.
M	MARCIANO	Oh, man... Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?
F	HANNA	'Cause she's got a great ass and you goT your head all the way up it.
M	MARCIANO	So?
F	HANNA	So it's no big thing. I don't even want her. You can have her, after. I want her husband and all his buddies; that's all. And you're gonna help.
M	NEIL	LAPD? The G? What? Where the hell did this heat come from?
M	CHRIS	Maybe it's only the EMA score, not us.
M	NEIL	Wake up! Assume they got our phones, our houses bugged, I beepers on all the cars. We got major problems.. Where's Cerrito?
M	NEIL (O.S.)	Recognize the cook?
M	CHRIS	No.
M	NEIL	D Block. San Q. Did a nickel on armed robbery. Hey, David. How you doing?
M	BREEDAN	Hey, Homeboy! All right! How bout you?
M	NEIL	Gettin' by. You okay?
M	BREEDAN	Yeah. Temporary. Know what I mean?
M	NEIL	Sure. See you around.
M	NEIL	What took you so long?
M	CERRITO	My car. Bugs. Two of 'em. Count 'em. One in the wheel well. Second behind the fire wall. Night of the party? I dropped Elaine and swung by EMA to check out the junction box...
M	CHRIS	Without the platinum how do we buy the bank score?
M	NEIL	I cash in T-bills to pay-off Kelso. That's not our problem.
M	CERRITO	What the hell happened to Van Zant and our 750?
M	NEIL	With the heat we got, you wanna play World War Two in the streets with Van Zant?
M	CERRITO	Van Zant gets a pass?!
M	NEIL	Fuck Van Zant. I got more motivation to whack him than you do. He is a luxury. Our problem is: jam and take the bank or split. And I mean right fucking now. Do not go home, pack, nothing. Thirty seconds from now we are on the road. Gone.
M	CHRIS	For me, the bank's worth the stretch. I say accept the risk, stay.
M	NEIL	Michael?
M	CERRITO	I roll with you. Whatever...
M	NEIL	Not on this one, Michael. On this one you make up your own mind.
M	CERRITO	...you figure this the best thing to do?
M	NEIL	I got some plans. To go away after. So for me, it's worth the stretch.
M	NEIL	But, Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away. T. Bonds; real estate. If I were you, I'd be smart and cut loose of this.
M	CERRITO	Hey. To me the action's half the juice anyway. I'm in.
M	NEIL	All right. All right.
M	CERRITO	That the place?
M	NEIL	Yeah. You see how the road leads back around?
M	CERRITO	Yeah.
M	NEIL	That's the escape route... This is it.
M	CASALS	I know. Let's go!
M	HANNA (O.S.)	What are they taking down out here?
M	CASALS	They were looking at something southwest...
F	HANNA	What's's that down there?
M	CASALS	An auto parts company. They're going to knock over a payroll?
M	SCHWARTZ	The company only pays by check.
F	HANNA	Maybe they're gonna steal the hub caps ...
F	HANNA	A billboard. Oil pumps. What the hell's goin' on?
M	SCHWARTZ	That's what we were trying to figure.
F	HANNA	I got an idea what they're looking at. You know what they're looking at?
F	HANNA	Is that guy something; or is that guy something? I mean, you gotta give this crew credit. They are so fucking good... Know what he's looking at?
F	HANNA	Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police Department. We just got made...
M	NATE	Worth it?
M	NEIL	There's enough circuit diagrams and blueprints here to build the bank. It's terrific.
M	NATE	His name is Hanna; first name, Vincent. I smeared this sergeant in vice five yards. Hanna's all over you. He's a hot dog. Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit. He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago and he was a fucking maniac. Was working Narcotics before that. He's good, Neil. Dedicated. Divorced three times. Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat. Vice sergeant says Hanna likes you. Thinks you're some kind of 'star.' 'You do this sharp, you do that sharp. Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.'
M	NATE	Funny as a heart attack. With this guy and this much heat, you should pass on the bank.
M	NEIL	I've had heat before.
M	NATE	That's not the point.
M	NEIL	This one's worth the stretch
M	NATE	You sure?
M	NEIL	I'm sure. Drop me at the garage.
M	HUGH	Hear from him yet?
M	VAN ZANT	Not a thing.
M	HUGH	Maybe he went away.
M	VAN ZANT	Yeah. Sure. Not hearing bothers me more... Where's this guy?
M	HUGH	This guy here...we put him on. Turns out he knows McCauley.
M	WAINGRO	Waingro. My name's Waingro.
M	VAN ZANT	I been living in this office day and night. What's with your friend?
M	WAINGRO	I know all about how he thinks. We took some major scores together. He's probably busy right now. But he's real thorough. He won't forget you...
M	VAN ZANT	That's reassuring.
M	WAINGRO	Yeah, I got some moves I could make here, that could be a big help to you...
F	HANNA	Justine?
F	HANNA	Where we going?
F	HANNA	Where are you going?
F	JUSTINE	Out.
F	HANNA	You know I'm on you. Let's talk.
M	NEIL	Sure. Buy me a cup of coffee.
F	HANNA	Seven years in San Quentin. In the hole for three. McNeil before that.
M	NEIL	Yeah.
F	HANNA	Was McNeil as tough as they say?
M	NEIL	You looking to become a penologist?
F	HANNA	You looking to go back? I chased some crews, the guys were lookin' to fuck up and get busted back.
M	NEIL	You must have worked some dipshit crews.
F	HANNA	I worked all kinds.
M	NEIL	You see me doing thrill-seeker liquor store holdups with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?
F	HANNA	No, I do not.
M	NEIL	Right. And I... I am never going back.
F	HANNA	Then don't take down scores.
M	NEIL	I do what I do best. I take scores. You do what you do best trying to stop guys like me.
F	HANNA	You never wanted a normal-type life?
M	NEIL	What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ballgames?
F	HANNA	That's part of it.
M	NEIL	That's nice. That your life?
F	HANNA	No. My wife spends half her time on the couch. My stepdaughter's got problems 'cause her real father's a world class asshole. And every moment I got, I'm chasing guys like you.
M	NEIL	A man told me once: you want to make moves? Don't keep anything in your life you're not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner. So if you're chasing me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a family?
F	HANNA	What are you, a monk?
M	NEIL	No. I got a woman. What do you tell her?
M	NEIL	She thinks I sell swimming pools.
F	HANNA	And if you spot me around the corner. You gonna walk out on her? Leave her flat? Like that? Not even say goodbye?
M	NEIL	That's the discipline.
F	HANNA	What you're left with is pretty empty.
M	NEIL	Yeah? Then maybe you and me, we should both go do somethin' else, pal.
F	HANNA	I don't know how to do anything else.
M	NEIL	...neither do I.
F	HANNA	And I don't much want to.
M	NEIL	Neither do I.
F	HANNA	We're sitting here like a coupla regular fellas. You do what you do. I do what I gotta do. What happens if I am there and I got to put you away? I won't like it. But, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're going to make into a widow, brother, you are gonna go down. 'Cause you don't have to be there. You coulda gone and been a... a mailman.
M	NEIL	There's a flip side to that coin. What if you got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? 'Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. But now that we been face to face, I would not feel good about that. But I won't hesitate. Not for one second.
F	HANNA	Maybe it'll happen that way. Or who knows ...
M	NEIL	...maybe we'll never see each other again.
F	HANNA	Can we have the bill.
M	DRUCKER	They dumped us!
F	HANNA	What?
M	DRUCKER	They dumped us.
F	HANNA	I was just with him!
M	DRUCKER	With who?
F	HANNA	Whattaya mean, "they dumped us"?!
M	DRUCKER	Chris slipped his tail. And Chris doesn't talk about jobs with Charlene so there's nothing for Marciano to get from her.
F	HANNA	Cerrito?
M	CASALS	Disappeared. No calls to the house. Not home.
F	HANNA	Locators on their cars?!
M	CASALS	Cerrito dumped his on a UPS van. Surveillance tailed a UPS van to Oxnard.
F	HANNA	They dumped all our tails?!!
M	CASALS	Yeah.
F	HANNA	I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago. What happened?
M	CASALS	Our tail saw you. McCauley pulled into a car wash. Car came out. He didn't.
F	HANNA	Does anybody have Any idea where the fuck these people are at? 'Cause whatever they are gonna do, they are doing it right now!
M	NEIL	Got it. it's eighteen inches in.
M	NEIL	Where the hell's Towner? I wanted to pass by early. I want to check the slot for the work car.
M	SOLENKO	How long those guys been sitting back there?
M	CASHIER	Hour or so...
M	SOLENKO	They think this a hotel?
M	SOLENKO (O.S.)	Twenty minutes, then I toss their asses out of here.
M	BREEDAN	You spell me? I didn't take my break yet ...
M	SOLENKO	That spic, Cisco Kid, whatever, didn't show. After the lunch rush, haul out the garbage and mop the back. Take your break later.
M	CERRITO	Here he is.
M	TOWNER	Hey! I'm out! I can't go.
M	NEIL	What are you talking about?
M	TOWNER	Anna's got a perforated appendix. We took her to the hospital. They're operating right now. It's a mess. I got to get back there...
M	NEIL	What the hell I do for a driver?!
M	TOWNER	Look, I got her sister there, waiting at the hospital. I came over 'cause I didn't want to talk on the phone. I got to get back. Last thing I'd do is let you down, Neil...
M	NEIL	What do you call this? Backing me up?
M	TOWNER	I waited too long trying to get past today! So now maybe she got peritonitis. I got to be there...
M	CHRIS	What the fuck do we do now?
M	NEIL	Here comes your second chance for a change of luck...
M	BREEDAN	Yeah?
M	NEIL	Need a driver. Remember the drill?
M	BREEDAN	Yeah. When?
M	NEIL	To-day.
M	BREEDAN	You're on.
M	NEIL	Out back in five.
M	SOLENKO	Where the fuck you going?
M	WAINGRO (O.S.)	They buy it?
M	TOWNER	Yeah.
M	WAINGRO	I got to hand it to you, sport. You're slick, pal smart how you handled all this. On the ball. Yeah.
M	TOWNER	Thanks. Where's Anna?
M	WAINGRO	She's resting. It's going down anyway? On schedule?
M	TOWNER	That's right.
M	WAINGRO	Make the call.
M	TOWNER	Where's she?
M	WAINGRO	I dunno.
M	TOWNER	Know what happens when Neil finds out? To both of us?
M	WAINGRO	I know what's gonna happen. Nothing's gonna happen. 'Cause I got it master minded. I got it jammed. This is solid. Take it from the kid.
M	TOWNER	You hope. What do you mean, you don't know where she is?
M	TOWNER	Anna?
M	WAINGRO	...showing her a good time.
M	NEIL (O.S.)	There's the slot.
M	BREEDAN	Looks right. Come out the door, your angle takes you into the car. Don't have to run around the doors. You want them open?
M	NEIL	No. 'Cause time is not a problem. And I want nothing to look weird.
M	BREEDAN	Po-lice response time?
M	NEIL	There is none.
M	BREEDAN	Why?
M	CHRIS	Cause we bypassed all the alarms last night. For you this whole gig is a slow cruise down Hawthorne...
M	NEIL	Drop us in the slot. Let's take it down.

M	NEIL	Six, seven hours. What do I owe you? It's got to be twenty thou.
M	NEIL	What is this?
M	DR. BOB	You're number one with a bullet on the six o'clock news. It's at least double the risk. So I'm doubling my price.
M	NEIL	You're wrong. It's four times the risk. 'Cause something happens to him, I'm coming back for you. And I'm double the worst trouble you ever had.
M	NEIL	I'll be back for you.

M	VAN ZANT	How the hell should I know?
M	NEIL (O.S.)	How much?
M	NATE	
M	NEIL (O.S.)	That's a rip-off.
M	NATE	You want a good getaway and you're hot with a big score in your pocket. You're a media event. What the fuck do you expect?
M	NEIL	What do I get for those dollars?
M	NATE	You end up in Ireland with good papers and plastic.
M	NEIL	Via what?
M	NATE	Lear jet to Vancouver. Then commercial to Reykjavik; then Dublin.

F	HANNA	You stick with the Charlene Shiherlis piece.
M	FARINA	Marciano's on a plane in here from, Las Vegas to pick her up. We got a house I set..
F	HANNA	Maybe Chris or Neil will come for her. Frankly, I doubt it. You work Neil's transport from here on the phones.
M	DRUCKER	McCauley's gotta be gone. He hadda have a getaway planned.
F	HANNA	And now he's gotta get a new one! Would you trust it after this afternoon? Someone, somewhere's agenting it for him. That's a main track. We got Shiherlis setting up. That's a main track. I want more.
M	FARINA	How much time we got?
F	HANNA	Eight, ten, twelve hours. For him to set up a new out. After that? He's gone. Bam! Bye- bye.
F	HANNA	He's the burglary cop with the "terrific tip?"
F	BOSKO	Yeah.
M	DIETER	Who are you?
F	HANNA	Hanna. Where'd it come from?
M	DIETER	I got my informants. Just like you got...
F	HANNA	I got Schwartz. Dead. Casals got no liver. He's dying. Don't come on to me with "confidential source" crap!
M	DIETER	Hugh. Hugh Benny. He gives me tips...!
F	HANNA	Who ratted-out McCauley? C'mon! Who? You?
F	CHARLENE	Whose side are you on?
M	MARCIANO	I'm on yours.
F	CHARLENE	You slimy piece of shit. What a joke.
M	MARCIANO	You told me you want out from under? You're scared to death of Neil. You wanted out? This is out! What's your end?
M	MARCIANO	You dump broad! How'd I get into this?
M	FARINA	Hey, hey! Go easy on the lady!
M	MARCIANO	Huh?
M	FARINA	You heard me. She had a rough ride. Go mix her a drink. Cabinet above the sink.
M	MARCIANO	Fuck her.
M	FARINA	Get the fuck in there!
M	FARINA	He's right. And you know it. You think you'd be betraying Chris?
F	CHARLENE	Yes.
M	FARINA	Well, you're right. You would be. But if you don't betray Chris, you betray Dominick. Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory 'cause you got no living parents to take him. Then he ends up state-raised and fucked for life. Your son Dominick's innocent. He didn't choose a life like that. Chris did.
M	FARINA	Give up Chris. You get off clean. Do it for your kid.
M	FARINA	Vincent. It's me. We're set here. She'll make the call.
F	CHARLENE	I'm going to give you an address of where I'm staying. Could you get it to Chris?
F	HANNA	Okay. M. C. U.
F	HANNA	It's me. Tracks back to this union guy, Van Zant. He had some beef with Neil. Neil already settled it. Van Zant got dead earlier tonight. Now Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born- again good citizen. So, he's revealed the key player is this cowboy Waingro. Used to be part of Neil's crew. Waingro committed a double murder today on Towner, a driver, and his old lady. Meanwhile Waingro's checked into the Airport Hyatt House under "Jamieson." Maybe Neil will make a move on him, but not likely. Get the word to bailbondsmen, bookies, snitches in County, etc. where Waingro is. And get a team down there to set it up. Want me to do it?
F	HANNA	No. You stay on who's agenting Neil's getaway. What have you got?
M	DRUCKER (V.O.)	Nothing yet.
F	HANNA	He's here. He's still here. I can feel it.
M	BERRYMAN	For how long?
F	HANNA	Eight, ten hours max.
F	EADY	What did you do? Was that you?
M	NEIL	It's what I don't do. I don't sell swimming pools. It would have been okay. You would have flown out after. You didn't need to do a thing. Now I'm jammed. We got to go together. Because we get dropped in a place and then I decide: New Zealand or Brazil or Tunisia, whatever. I can't leave a string back here to where I am.
F	EADY	What.
M	NEIL	I rob and steal for a living. Do you understand?
F	EADY	You killed people?
M	NEIL	If they got in the way. Yes. It's their problem.
F	EADY	The woman on the grass...where her husband got shot..
M	NEIL	Elaine Cerrito. Michael Cerrito's wife. Michael was my friend. He knew the risks. He didn't have to be there. He coulda been a...been a mailman.
F	EADY	I don't believe it.
M	NEIL	Believe it.
M	NEIL	Eady. Get packed. Get dressed. Let's go.
M	NEIL	Eady! !
F	EADY	Why you do this to me! What I do to you?!
M	NEIL	Shut up!
M	NEIL	Use these credit cards. They say "Mr. and Mrs." I reserved the car. Buy me some clothes. Here's a list. I can't go home for my stuff. Can you do it?
F	EADY	When's it over?
M	NEIL	Twenty-two hours. Then we fly out of here...clean.
F	EADY	I want you to let me go. When will you let me go?
M	NEIL	You can go now. There's the door, you want out...
F	EADY	No, I have to do what you say. But will you let me leave after?
M	NEIL	It will be different...
M	JUSTINE (O.S.)	It's ready...
F	JUSTINE	Oh. Meet Vincent.
M	RALPH	Excuse me. You didn't tell me you were...
M	RALPH	Oh, my God... What's your name?
M	RALPH	I should....Ralph...I'm...
F	HANNA	I'm Vincent Hanna.
F	JUSTINE	Don't you even get angry?
F	HANNA	I'm angry. Ralph, you can ball my wife. You can lounge around her $1.7 million condominium on her sofa. You can do all those things. But you do not get to watch my fucking TV...!
F	HANNA	I've never screwed around. I've been true blue to you since the day we met.
F	JUSTINE	It would have been preferable if you had! You made me do this!
F	HANNA	Right I had Ralph fuck you 'cause it makes me feel so good.
F	JUSTINE	Put down the television. You look ridiculous. Dr. Prince says I'm trying to get your attention. Christ! I have to pay someone to figure out my life with you.
M	RALPH	Maybe I should...
F	HANNA	Shut up!
F	JUSTINE	Why's it my job to figure it all out and explain it to you?
F	HANNA	'Cause you're the one who spends all the time on the couch.
F	JUSTINE	And what do you do?
F	HANNA	What do I do? I speak the English language. Words. Sentences even.
F	JUSTINE	How admirable: proletarian candor.
F	HANNA	Thank you.
F	JUSTINE	Except you don't say a damned thing. You neglect me. You don't call. I can worry about you or not. So I withdraw. You don't notice. You're walking through our life chloroformed, Vincent. Wake up. It's almost over.
M	NATE	I got Cerrito's share deposited in the Delaware Trust for Elaine. She's pretty bad... Passports. Traveler's checks. Plastic. Hangar 17. Plane call letters are 1011 Sierra. Touches down, holds for five minutes and splits. The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed flight plan. The works. Here's the address Charlene said she was at. But I don't have documents for her.
M	CHRIS	I'm not flying. I'm drivin'.
M	NATE	Fly. Send for her later. Can't you talk to him?
M	NEIL	I been trying.
M	NATE	Talk to you in three hours in case there's changes.
M	NEIL	Use the Camaro. Its clean and will stand a DMV check.
M	CHRIS	How you getting around?
M	NEIL	Someone's picking me up.
M	CHRIS	A girl on the side?
M	NEIL	See you, cowboy.
M	CHRIS	So long, brother.
F	EADY	Clothes are in the trunk.
M	NEIL	Any trouble?
F	EADY	No. When's it over?
M	NEIL	Six hours. 8 p.m.
M	NEIL	I'll buy you lunch. Everything's smooth. We're going to fly away...
M	FARINA	Not a thing. What about you?
F	HANNA	Someone's agenting Neil's stuff?
M	HANNA (CONT'D)	Who? The Tooth Fairy? Talk to you later.
F	HANNA	...how did Charlene get the Marina address passed to Chris?
F	HANNA	I don't believe I didn't think of this. Farina?
M	NATE (V.O.)	Yeah?
M	NEIL	Hi ya.
M	NATE (V. 0.)	You okay?
M	NEIL	Yeah, Breedan's end?
M	NATE	Still can't find nobody. It's in the Delaware Trust. You tell me later what to do. And about your ride. No changes. Right on schedule.
M	NEIL	Okay...
M	NATE (V. 0.)	By the by: I heard your pal is checked into the Airport Hyatt under "Jamieson"...if you still care...
M	NATE (V.O.)	I figured you wouldn't waste the time.
M	NEIL	You figured right. Take it easy, old man.
M	NATE	You take it easy. Be careful, huh?
M	NEIL	That was the last bridge.
F	HANNA	He blows out of here, you'll do his time. I want...
M	NATE	Screw what you want. Who the fuck are you?
F	HANNA	Your worst nightmare. Hard time, Nate!
M	NATE	I ain't looking at shit, and you know it! So don't con me.
F	BOSKO	I'll work him...
M	NATE	Go ahead!
F	HANNA	Don't touch him! Accessory. Armed robbery and murder one. Dealing stolen merchandise and securities. You agent for Neil. At least the armored car and bank. Everything I tie him into, I tie you into. Two cops dead. Other bodies on the sidewalk. You understand that kind of heat? You fucking get it!
M	NATE	Neil who...?
F	HANNA	Book him on Accessory to Armed Robbery, Murder One, A.D.W., and Trafficking Stolen Merchandise. The Nazi's in Quentin will turn your ass into a satchel. You're an old man. Gimme Neil!
M	NATE	What I'll give you is so many false arrest lawsuits, you won't have time to write traffic tickets!
F	HANNA	Get me Farina.
M	DRUCKER	Can we put Nate away?
F	HANNA	With a staff of five or six marshaling physical evidence for six months after two years' worth of continuances...maybe he'll do 18 months. Won't fucking happen. Check the bait.
F	BOSKO	Waingro?
F	HANNA	Yeah. At the hotel.
M	NEIL	Look over there.
M	NEIL	I don't even know how to think like this...cause this has happened to me late in my life. But I got some expectations. For us. You can walk right now if you want. Walk away. Or you...on your own...you choose to come with me. I got enough in there to take care of us for forever.
M	NEIL	Eady.
M	NEIL	Eady?
M	COP #6 (V.O.)	Richie. A possible moved into the zone.
M	COP #5 (V.O.)	We got him. I copy.
M	FARINA (V.O.)	Got a live one.
F	HANNA	I'll hold.
M	FARINA	C'mon, sugar: show yourself
M	MARCIANO	Do it!
M	FARINA	Shut up!!
M	FARINA	One second at the window. Then it's all over...
F	CHARLENE	looks at Farina. She slowly crosses to the window. Marciano has faded to the back of the room.
F	CHARLENE	For Christ's sake...that's not even him. That's not Chris.
M	CHRIS	Any of you guys know anything for rent around here?
M	BASKETBALL PLAYER #1	Alberiz's grocery on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.
M	FARINA	Unit two. This is command. Take him at the street. Check him out.
M	UNIT TWO (V.O.)	
M	MARCIANO	Where the hell is he?
F	CHARLENE	Maybe he's not coming.
M	MARCIANO	You better hope he shows! Or you're going to the can, you two dollar...
M	FARINA	Get him the hell out of here!
M	UNIT TWO (V.O.)	Command.
M	FARINA	Yeah?
M	UNIT TWO (V.O.)	This guy's John Pearson. Valid I.D. car's registered to one Bukowski. Ran a make to DMV. It's clean. So's the car.
M	FARINA	Let him go.
M	FARINA	Want a cup of coffee while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?
F	CHARLENE	That would be nice.
M	FARINA (V.O.)	False alarm, Lieutenant.
M	HANNA (V.O.)	What's the score?
M	DESK CLERK/COP	On this Waingro?
M	DESK CLERK/COP (CONT'D)	I just told Bosko. Zero. Nothing's happening.
F	HANNA	You know what? Neil's gone. Bam! Flyin' like' a bird.
F	BOSKO	C'mon! How do you know? We still got...
F	HANNA	What do we got? Bon voyage, motherfucker, you were good. I'm going to the hotel. I'm gonna take a shower. I'm gonna sleep for a month.
F	LAUREN	...Daddy?
F	HANNA	You're gonna be okay, baby. Your mommy and me are here. Everybody's here. We're going to take care of you. We love you...
M	ORDERLY	Let me take her.
F	HANNA	I got her.
M	DOCTOR	Watch her tongue!
F	HANNA	She's not epileptic! This isn't a seizure.
M	DOCTOR	5 mg of Thorazine.
F	HANNA	You okay, baby?
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Hey there, old aware ones, and you, too, my fair ones ...
F	EADY	What is it?
M	NEIL	Nothing.
M	RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Brought to you this fine day which is A-okay!
M	NEIL	I got this errand to run that I forgot.
F	EADY	The airport is right there. Is there time?
M	NEIL	Sure. It's a thing I got to take care of... is all.
M	NEIL	Leave it running.
M	NEIL	...be right back, Eady.
F	EADY	Neil...?
M	PAINTER TWO	What's going on?
M	PAINTER ONE	Nothing. He's watching TV.
M	PAINTER TWO	We going to finish this game or what?
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	Hyatt House.
M	NEIL	Hi. It's the kitchen again. A... "Jamieson" ordered a BLT and they got his room number screwed up.
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	They're always doing that.
M	NEIL	Thanks, love.
M	PA (V.O.)	A fire has been reported. Please leave your rooms now. Proceed down marked fire exits. Use the staircases. Do not use the elevators. This is NOT a drill. A fire...etc.
M	PAINTER ONE	Yeah. Whyn't you call out for pizza? Sausage, peppers, onions... Hey.
M	PAINTER TWO	What?
M	PAINTER ONE	That chick on the ninth floor got naked and she's pressing herself against the glass again.
M	PAINTER TWO	Let me see.
M	PAINTER TWO (O.S.)	Oh, boy...!
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	Lt. Hanna. Telephone. Lt. Hanna.
F	HANNA	Fuck McCauley. You handle it. Call Bosko and Drucker in. Get me at the hospital after.
F	JUSTINE	...Will things change between us?
F	HANNA	I don't know... Probably not... ...but I am reminded of how much I love you. But that may not be enough.
F	JUSTINE	You have to go to work, don't you?
F	HANNA	Yeah.
F	JUSTINE	Be careful, Vincent. Be very careful... Let's keep on trying?
M	WAINGRO (O.S.)	Yeah?
M	NEIL	I'm hotel security. We're evacuating the floor.
M	WAINGRO (O.S.)	I can't leave.
M	NEIL	Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to.
M	NEIL	I should have dumped you in that parking lot. Look at me, you sick fuck.
M	NEIL	Gimme your eyes. 'Cause you're gonna die.
F	HANNA	Casals come in.
M	CASALS (V.O.)	Vincent. I'm in the southeast stairwell.
F	HANNA	What's the situation?
M	CASALS (V.O.)	Three teams are moving up the other three stairwells to the 14th floor. Elevators are out of commission because of the fire alarm. Surveillance said McCauley looked right at 'em. Didn't seem surprised.
F	HANNA	It means he knew we were here and came anyway. I got two Special Weapons Teams deployed at the front and back exits. Choppers.
F	HANNA	Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Stay on it. 10-4.
M	NEIL	...not half bad.
F	HANNA	...pretty good your own self.
M	THE END
