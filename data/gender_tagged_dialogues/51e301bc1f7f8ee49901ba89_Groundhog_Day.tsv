M	HIBERNATING GROUNDHOGS	A family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
M	HAWLEY	Christ, what a pit. Phil" The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley. What?
M	HAWLEY	It's February first, Phil. You know what tomorrow is? Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
F	PHIL	Oh, no! Not again. He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.
F	PHIL	Forget it! I'm not going. Phil ducks into the studio.
F	PHIL	Get away from me. I'm working.
M	HAWLEY	So what's the outlook? We gonna get that blizzard? Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
F	PHIL	No way. All that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg.
M	HAWLEY	Good, 'cause you're going up to Punxsutawney to cover the groundhog story tomorrow morning and I want you back here in time to do the five.
F	PHIL	Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will you! I covered the goddamn groundhog last year and the year before that.
M	HAWLEY	And you'll do it :next year and the year after, too. When I worked in San Diego, I covered the swallows coming back to Capistrano for ten years in a row.
F	PHIL	You should've killed the guy who made you do that.
M	HAWLEY	I wanted to do it.
F	PHIL	Then you should've killed yourself. I don't want to get stuck with the groundhog for the rest of my life. It's a cute story. He comes out, he looks around, he wrinkles up his little nose, he sniffs around a little, he sees his shadow, he d oesn't see his shadow-- it's nice. People like it.
F	PHIL	Many people are morons.
M	HAWLEY	Just do it.
F	PHIL	What'11 you give me? Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
M	HAWLEY	I'll give you Rita. Rita, could you come here for a second? I got a little job for you. Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent, You can't send Rita out on a story like this. She's just a cub, a pup, still wet behind the ears. Look at her. Her ears are sopping wet. This needs a Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a big story. People need to know. What's the story?
M	HAWLEY	The Punxsutawney Groundhog Festival.
F	RITA	Gil, if it's all right with you I ' d rather follow-up on the nurses' strike. You can do the nurses when you get back. Just take the squeaky wheel here up to Punxsutawney and get him back in one piece. Okay?
F	RITA	Yeah, okay. Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She You know, this could be extremely interesting.
F	RITA	I've never done a weather story before. What's Punxsutawney like?
F	PHIL	Oh, it's an enchanted place. A magical world. It's the Constantinople of the whole Western Appalachian-Susquehanna Drainage system.
F	RITA	Do you always joke?
F	PHIL	About 70 to 80% of the time. Inside I'm actually a very shy and sensitive person.
F	RITA	A lot of people around here think you're not very sincere.
F	PHIL	Tell me the names of these people.
F	RITA	I'll line up a crew and transportation. If you don't feel like driving, we can all go up in the van together.
F	PHIL	I think I'll take my own car. I ' m not that fond of my fellow man. RITA Nice attitude.
F	PHIL	Nice face. Why don't you ride up with me?
F	RITA	No, thanks. STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
F	PHIL	They don't really think of me as a weatherman around here. More of a "personality," but with the credibility of a first-class broadcast journalist. Once you look at my tape I think you'll see what they mean. Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for I just want to know one thing: did I do something wrong or are you just tired of me or what? I have to know. Phil sighs.
F	PHIL	Dan, can I call you back? I've just been handed something and I better get on it... ...Okay, thanks. You didn't do anything wrong, Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of you. It's just that I don't have time for a real relationship right now. I told you that the first time we went out.
M	STEPHANIE	Everybody says that at the beginning of a relationship.
F	PHIL	I'm different. I really meant it! Things are really starting to move for me now. I ' m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of my life. I was just talking to the CBS guy about a network job. I want that. This is just the beginning for me. I can't waste any more time.
M	STEPHANIE	Are you saying our relationship was a waste of time?
F	PHIL	Our relationship? We went out a total of four times! And only twice did anything happen. It was fun but I don't see that as a big commitment.
M	STEPHANIE	I had our charts done. My astrologer says we're extremely compatible. There may even be some past lives involvement here.
F	PHIL	See? So we've already done this. Let's move on. Next case.
M	STEPHANIE	You know what's wrong with you, Phil? You're selfish. You don't have time for anyone but yourself.
F	PHIL	That's what I ' m trying to tell you. You don't want to be with me. You can do better. Look, Stephanie, if I ever said or did anything to mislead you I'm sorry for that, but right now I have to do this groundhog thing and I don't have a handle on it yet. He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
M	PHIL (CONT.)	I'll tell you what. I ' m going to do some serious thinking while I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay? He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
M	PHIL (V.O.)	I'm on my way to Punxsutawney... Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun? I think that all depends on you.
F	PHIL	. . . . I thought maybe you could meet me up there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours....So I ' m supposed to spend the night in Punxsutawney all alo ne? Thanks.
M	A SIGN	"Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.
F	PHIL	Rita! I can't stay here. Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van. Prima donnas.
F	RITA	It's okay. I'll handle it. She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another
F	RITA	What's the problem, Phil?
F	PHIL	I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago and I was miserable. It's like a minimum security prison. I'm not staying here.
F	RITA	You're not staying here. I ' m not?
F	RITA	No, Larry and I don't care but I thought you might, so I booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on Cherry Street. Here's the address. She hands him a card. Great. That's great. That's the mark of a really good producer. Making the talent happy.
F	RITA	Whatever I can do.
F	PHIL	Really? Will you be my love slave?
F	RITA	Whatever I can do within reason. Would you like to have dinner with Larry and me?
F	PHIL	No thanks, I've seen Larry eat. Why don't you ditch Larry and let me take you someplace nice?
F	RITA	You mean like a date?
F	PHIL	Yeah.
F	RITA	Oh, no.
F	PHIL	Okay. I get it. You're a little intimidated by me, you're all excited about the shoot tomorrow, you want everything to go just perfect. I understand. You just get some sleep. Tomorrow will be great.
F	RITA	Well, that's something to look forward to. I'll see you in the morning. He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.
M	LARRY	Did he actually call himself "the talent?" Larry snorts and continues unloading their gear. A digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio
M	DEEJAY	Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there Phil grimaces and swings out of bed.
M	SIDEK ICK	It's cold out there everyday. W hat is this-- Miami Beach? The deejay laughs. Phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee
M	DEEJAY	Not hardly. And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing--
M	SIDEKICK	That "blizzard thing?" Phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave.
M	SIDEKICK (CONT.)	Oh, here's the report: the National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing.
M	DEEJAY	Yes they are, but there's another reason today is very special--
M	SIDEKICK	Es pec ia lly cold--
M	DEEJAY	Especially cold, okay, but the big question on everybody's lips--
M	SIDEKICK	Ch ap pe d lips--
M	DEEJAY	:--on their chapped lips, right-- Do you think Phil's going to come out and see his shadow?
M	SIDEKICK	Punxsutawney Phil. Phil looks up at himself in the mirror, admiring his own face.
M	DEEJAY	That's right, rodent lovers!
M	BOTH DEEJAYS	Groundhog Day1 SOUND EFFECT of GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS. Phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror.
F	PHIL	Never again.
M	CHUBBY MAN	Morning .
F	PHIL	Morning .
M	CHUBBY MAN	Think it'll be an early Spring?
F	PHIL	I ' m predicting March 21st.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
F	PHIL	Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs. Lancaster.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Would you like some coffee?
F	PHIL	I don't suppose it1 d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here. I don't really know --
F	PHIL	Forget it. This '11 be fine. I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities.
F	PHIL	My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast, high today in the low 30's, dropping to the low 20's tonight, but I'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as .Philadelphia. You want to talk weather, you asked the right guy. He heads for the door. Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors?
F	PHIL	Unfortunately yes. Phil exits. An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a
M	MAN (O.C.)	Hey, Phil! A big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing
M	NED	Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil looks at him vaguely.
F	PHIL	I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh--
M	NED	My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heckrfire remember you. Well? Phil stares, trying to remember.
M	NED	Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned? Ned the Head. Come on, buddy. Case Western High?
F	PHIL	Ned?
M	NED	I see you clicking through that brain of yours. Click-click, c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing! Ned Ryerson, did the whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior ^year^ almost didn't graduate. Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went out with your sister Mary Pat a couple of times-- 'til you told me not to anymore. Well? Ned Ryerson.
M	NED	Bing!
F	PHIL	So what're you doing with yourself, Ned?
M	NED	Phil, I sell insurance.
F	PHIL	No kidding.
M	NED	Do you have life insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you do, I bet you could u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I got a feeling you don't have any. Am I right?
F	PHIL	You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk to you but I really have to-- Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint.
M	NED	That's okay. I'll walk with you. When I see an opportunity, I charge it, like a bull. Ned the Bull, that's me now. Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but I think it's all just a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single .premium life? That could be the ticket for you, buddy. God, it's good to see you! Hey, what're you doing for dinner?
F	PHIL	Dinner? Umm, I don't think that's going to work for me. As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a
M	NED	Hey, look out for that first step! It's a doozy! Phil looks at him with murderous contempt. Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and
F	RITA	How could he be late?
M	LARRY	Prima donnas.
F	RITA	It's just so-- inconsiderate.
M	LARRY	What happens to some people? They're born nice. They grow up nice. You put 'em on TV and - bam! Prima donnas. Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd.
F	RITA	Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil. Over here! Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark
F	RITA	Where've you been?
F	PHIL	I got hung up with some jerk I went to high school with. So, did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned, didn't you? Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.
F	RITA	You're incredible.
F	PHIL	Who told you?
F	RITA	Ready when you are. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and
F	RITA	Looks like they're starting. Roll tape.
M	LARRY	Rolling. Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly
F	PHIL	Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn here, to this tiny hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil, the world's most famous weatherman, the groundhog, who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring. Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good.
F	PHIL	And here's the big moment we've all been waiting for. Let's just see what Mr. Groundhog has to say. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
F	PHIL	Hey! Over here, you little weasel! Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
F	PHIL	Great shot, huh, folks? Well, that was certainly worth the trip. Now we'll be hearing from Mr. Buster Greene, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the so-called Seer of Seers who will interpret for us. BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat, He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter. The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.
F	PHIL	Well, that's it. Sorry you couldn't be here in person to share the electric moment. This is one event where televison really fails to capture the excitement of thousands of people gathered to watch a large squirrel predict the weather, and I for one am deeply grateful to have been a part of it. Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors. Larry cuts the camera.
F	RITA	You want to try one that's a little sweeter?
F	PHIL	That's as sweet as I get. I'm outa here. As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting Prima donnas. Phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy, loud
F	RITA	That was really lousy.
F	PHIL	Is it my fault the little rat went south on us?
F	RITA	A real professional would have handled it. You acted like it was a personal insult. Who do you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer?
F	PHIL	God, you really take this stuff seriously, don't you.
F	RITA	Yes, I do. As far as I ' m concerned there are no little stories, Phil. Only little reporters with big egos who think they're too good for the job they have to do.
F	PHIL	You really don't know me very well, do you. 'Cause if you did you could never say something like that about me. I care! Call me a cockeyed optimist but I happen to think there's more to this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night.
F	RITA	Is that so.
F	PHIL	Yes, that is so. Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond.
F	PHIL	So as far as us getting together, would you say the glass is half empty or half full? Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
M	LARRY	You ready? We better get going if we ' re going to stay ahead of the weather.
F	PHIL	You don't have to rush off, you know. That storm is 'going to miss us completely.
F	RITA	Nice working with you, Phil. See you around. Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.
M	PHIL(V.O)	I'll call you after I see the network guy. I should be back there in a couple of hours...What?...1 can't hear you-- you're breaking up...Hello? Sabrina?
F	PHIL	Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit! He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a
F	PHIL	No. No!
F	PHIL	What's going on, Officer?
M	PATROLMAN	Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1 the road. Big accident up ahead. Blizzard movin1 in.
F	PHIL	What blizzard? A couple of flakes! An isolated phenomenon of nature.
M	PATROLMAN	Are you nuts? We got a major storm movin' in.
F	PHIL	No, no. All that moisture is going to miss us and hit Harrisburg.
M	PATROLMAN	Pal, you got that moisture on your head.
F	PHIL	But I have to get to Pittsburgh today!
M	PATROLMAN	Mister, the only place anybody's goin' on this road is back to Punxsutawney. Phil glowers at him and shivers.
F	PHIL	So all the long distance lines a re down? What about the sa tellite? Is it snowing in space?...But I have to call Pittsburgh...Isn't there some special line you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities?...Well, I'm both really. I'm a celebrity in an emergency. Can you patch me through on that line?
F	PHIL	You never saw me on TV-- on the news?
F	NANCY	I don't think so. What part of the news do you do?
F	PHIL	I ' m the White House correspondent for NBC news.
F	NANCY	Oh , I ' m so sure .
F	PHIL	Ask me anything?
F	NANCY	Okay, how big is the White House?
F	PHIL	Three bedrooms, two and a half baths. Looks much bigger than it , is. Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor.
F	PHIL	Good start. I ' m sure they'll be very happy. So what do you say? You want to play doggie obedience school with me?
F	NANCY	Thanks. I'll pass. She gets up to leave.

F	MRS. LANCASTER	Would you like some coffee?
F	PHIL	Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a little strange.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities.
F	PHIL	Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs. Lancaster?
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Is that the Italian dessert with the brandy and the chocolate mousse?
F	PHIL	No, that's spaghetti. Never mind. He heads for the door, still in a daze.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors? I don't know. I don't think so. I'll tell you after I wake up. Phil exits.
F	PHIL	Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's everybody going?
M	PASSERBY	To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day! The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open-

M	NED	Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.

F	PHIL	To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m not feeling real well. Could you excuse me?
M	NED	Now it's funny you should mention your health 'cause you'll never guess what I do.
F	PHIL	Do you sell insurance, Ned?
M	NED	Bing again! You're sharp as a tack today. Do you have life insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you do, I bet you could use more -- who couldn't?" -- but I got a feeling you don't have any. Am I right?

F	PHIL	Better. Almost too hard, Rita.

F	RITA	I don't know. Can you?
F	PHIL	Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m having a problem-- no, I may be having a problem.
F	RITA	What are you trying to say?
F	PHIL	I'm trying to say that if I was having a problem, just hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know that you're someone I could count on in a crisis. What did you do last night? The crowd begins to hush.
M	LARRY	We better get started. We're going to miss it.
F	PHIL	Were not going to miss it. They're going to miss it. Phil. We've been out here for an hour. We're cold and tired. Let's just get this and get out of here.

Everybody's here on Gobbler's Knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to tell us just how much more of this we can expect. The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door, Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
F	PHIL	My forecast is we're going to see the groundhog peek its head out of its hole, look around a little bit, then he's going to come out, scamper over to this general area, look at the crowd for a second, make a little burping noise and run back into the ground.
F	RITA	That's it. I'm going to kill him. Phil looks at his watch.

For Channel 9 News, this is Phil Connors in Punxsutawney . He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita.
F	PHIL	How was that? It was good. A little smarmy for my taste, but I guess that's what sells.
F	PHIL	Could I talk to you about a matter that is not work related?
F	RITA	You never talk about work.
F	PHIL	Do you know what I did last night?
F	RITA	Do I want to know? I destroyed my hotel room.
F	RITA	You whatl This is not some kind of rock and roll tour. We don't have the budget for that--
F	PHIL	No, it's okay. This morning it was all right again. That's what I have to talk to you about.
F	RITA	Phil, what are you doing?
F	RITA	Could I have some coffee, please? The waiter pours her a cup. I'll be back to take your order.
F	RITA	Thanks. Okay, so tell me. How'd you know where to put the camera?
F	PHIL	Because I've done it before.
F	RITA	I know, but the groundhog doesn't do exactly the same thing every year, does he?
F	PHIL	I ' m not talking about last year. I ' m talking about today. I lived it before.
F	RITA	You're having deja vu?
F	PHIL	Big time. Rita, I know it's nuts but I keep reliving the same day o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day-- today. This is the third time.
F	RITA	Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the punchline.
F	PHIL	No, really. It's like today never happened. I shaved my head last night, today its all grown back. I could probably cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop! They'd grow back. Just like a starfish. I probably don't even have to floss?
F	RITA	I'm wracking my brain, but I can't even begin to imagine why you'd make up something like this.
F	PHIL	'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm asking for your help. Rita looks at him for a long moment.
F	RITA	Okay, I'll bite. What do you want me to do?
F	PHIL	The truth? I'd 1ike you to spend the next 24 hours with me and don't leave my side for a second.
F	RITA	I see. You know, Phil, you can charm all the little P.A.'s at the station, all the secretaries, and even some of the weekend a nchors, but not me-- not in a thousand years. Wa it a second--
F	RITA	Not if I was dying and your breath was the only cure; not if having your child was the only way to preserve the human race. Just get it out of your head because it is NOT GOING TO
F	PHIL	So much for the truth. Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
M	LARRY	You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather.
F	RITA	Yeah, , I ' m . ready, Larry. Good luck, Phil.
M	INSERT	X-rays of Phil's skull are slapped up onto a light box.
M	NEUROLOGIST	No spots, no tumors, no lesions, no clots, no aneurisms. Everything looks fine and dandy to me, Mr. Connors. Have you considered psychiatric help? That's kind of an unusual problem, Mr. Connors. Most of my work is with couples and families. Phil is lying on a couch. His head is completely shaved.
F	PHIL	Yeah, but you're still a psychologist. You must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing.
M	PSYCHOLOGIST	Sort of, I guess. Abnormal Psychology.
F	PHIL	So based on that what would you say? I ' d say that maybe you're -- I don't know -- a little delusional.
F	PHIL	You're saying this thing is not really happening to me?
M	PSYCHOLOGIST	Uh-huh.
F	PHIL	Then how do I know this conversation is really happening?
M	PSYCHOLOGIST	I guess you don't.
F	PHIL	Then forget about me paying you. A discreet little alarm sounds. I'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr. Connors.
F	PHIL	Wait! Are you saying I'm crazy?
M	PSYCHOLOGIST	Not necessarily. If it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible. How's tomorrow for you? Phil glowers at him. Now if the moon exerts a gravitational pull strong enough to cause the tides, .then it may be theoretically possible for a Black Hole or a Singularity of sufficient magnitude to actually bend time enough to cause it to fold back ,on itself.
F	PHIL	You think that's a realistic possibility? A paper airplane sails past his head, accompanied by a noisy All right! I think someone may just need a little visit to the Assistant Principal's office! Get back in your seats. The bell has not rung yet. The kids sit back down, but keep up their noisy chatter.
M	SCIENTIST	Well, I ' m speaking purely hypothetically.
M	TEACH ER	So the princess picked up the frog and kissed him. Phil stops outside the door to listen.
M	TEACHER	Now who can tell me what happened when the princess kissed the frog.
M	LITTLE BOY	Her lips got slimed! The whole class erupts in giggles and shrieks.
M	T EACHER	Okay, come on now. What happened when she kissed the frog?
M	LITTLE GIRL	The princess kissed the frog and the spell got broke and he turned into a handsome prince and they got married and lived happily ever after.
M	TEACHER	That's right.
F	PHIL	Gus, what would you do if there was no tomorrow? You mean like if the world was gonna end?
F	PHIL	No, I mean like if it was never going to end. If everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you couldn't get out and nothing you did mattered?
M	GUS	You're right. Everyday is the same, I can't get out of here and nothin' I do matters.
M	V RALPH	No, he's askin1 you a question, ya idiot.
M	GUS	What was the question?
M	RALPH	What if nothing mattered?! Jeez, I know what I'd do. I ' d j ust spend all my time drivin' fast, gettin1 loaded and gettin' laid. That's it.
F	PHIL	That's it. It just doesn't get any better than this, does it? Good friends, good conversation and quality brew. Drink up, boys. They salute each other and drink.
M	RALPH	Where you stayin', Phil? We'll drop you off.
F	PHIL	Hey, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Give me your keys. He's as wasted as they are, but Ralph hands over his keys
M	RALPH	Thanks , man .
F	PHIL	It's nothing. Get in. They all pile into the front seat with Phil at the wheel.
F	PHIL	Seatbelts. Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging
F	PHIL	This is great, Ralph!
M	RALPH	Oh, hey, take a left! Phil passes the intersection.
M	RALPH	You missed it!
F	PHIL	No problem -- Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up
F	PHIL	So many rules --
M	RALPH	You can say that again.
F	PHIL	"Don't do this--" "Don't do that -- " He mows down a row of parking meters.
M	POLICE CAR	It comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the Buick mothers !
F	PHIL	No more rules!
M	RALPH	No more rules!
M	RALPH	That's two!
F	PHIL	Having a good time?
M	RALPH	I'm having a great time! Phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour. Gus is looking
M	GUS	Hey, uh --
F	PHIL	Phil.
M	GUS	Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog.
F	PHIL	Right.
M	GUS	Hey, Phil? How're we going to get out of this? Gus, you're just going to have to trust me on this one. He tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus's eyes go wide with The police dive out of the way.
M	PHIL AND RALPH	Yahooooo! The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. He
M	DEEJAY	Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there today. Phil talks out loud along with them.
M	PHIL AND SIDEKICK	It's cold out there everyday. What is this-- Miami Beach?
F	MRS. LANCASTER	W o u l d you-- Phil interrupts, answering all her questions before she even Yes, I would like some coffee; the weather is going to be cold and overcast with blizzard conditions moving in later today; and yes, I will be staying an extra day. Why thank you.
F	PHIL	Mrs. Lancaster, has anyone been around here looking for me this morning? Maybe a state official, blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick, badge, driving a late-model Ford br Chevy, black and white with bub ble lights on top-- No, no one like that-- I .don't-- Will they be?
F	PHIL	Apparently not. Phil gooses her, grabs a sweet roll, and heads for the door,
M	NED (O.C.)	Hey, Phil! Phil slips off his glove as Ned Ryerson lumbers toward him.
M	NED	Phil! Phil Connors!
F	PHIL	Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head! Before Ned can say another word, Phil SLUGS HIM. Ned goes Phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area
F	PHIL	You here to see the groundhog? She gives him a look. It's obvious she's never seen him
F	NANCY	Can you think of another reason anybody'd be out here at dawn on a freezing day?
F	PHIL	What's your name?
F	NANCY	Nancy Taylor. And you are--
F	PHIL	Where'd you go to high school? What is this? High school? She really doesn't know what to make of Phil but she decides to
F	NANCY	Lincoln High school. In Pittsburgh. Who are you?
F	PHIL	Who was your twelfth grade English teacher?
F	NANCY	Are you kidding?
F	PHIL	I'm waiting.
F	NANCY	.Mrs. Walsh.
F	PHIL	Walsh. Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh.
F	NANCY	Is this some kind of come-on?
F	PHIL	I'm not really sure. We'll have to see. Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position.
F	RITA	Is this some new fad diet? Don't you worry about cholesterol? Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate
F	PHIL	I don't worry about anything anymore.
F	RITA	What makes you so special? Everybody worries about something.
F	PHIL	That's exactly what makes me so special. He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head.
F	PHIL	What?
F	RITA	"The wretch, concentered all in self, Living, shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonored, and unsung." Sir Walter Scott.
F	PHIL	"There was a young man from Na n t uc k e t-- "
F	RITA	That's really funny. When are you going to grow up, Phil?
F	PHIL	At this rate-- never. Okay if I smoke? Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.
F	RITA	You really do have a death wish, don't you?
F	PHIL	Just the opposite, Rita. I have a life wish. I'm just trying to enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the little things. Don't you ever just want to cut loose and go wild? I wouldn't even know what it means to go wild.
F	PHIL	Yeah, well, that's where I come in. Going wild is one of my specialties. Last night I got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car. Oh, really? You look pretty good this morning.
F	PHIL	That's my point. I know you won't believe me, but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn't matter one bit. Absolutely no consequences. Complete and total freedom.
F	RITA	And how. . , do we manage that?
F	PHIL	You leave that to me. Why don't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day? You never make it through that blizzard anyway. Larry enters the diner and spots them.
F	RITA	I'll take my chances with the -weather. But you have a good time.
F	PHIL	Don't worry. I plan to.
F	PHIL	Nancy? Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically. Nancy, right?
F	NANCY	I'm sorry, I--
F	PHIL	Nancy Taylor? Lincoln High? I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's English class.
F	NANCY	T h at --
F	PHIL	Phil Connors.
F	NANCY	--is amazing!
F	PHIL	You don't remember me, do you?
F	NANCY	I don't-- sure, I think--
F	PHIL	We used to shoot spit balls--
F	NANCY	Yeah, oh, God--
F	PHIL	I even asked you to the prom.
F	NANCY	Phil Connors.
F	PHIL	Yeah.
F	NANCY	How ARE you?!
F	PHIL	I ' m great. Wow, you look terrific. Hey, listen, I gotta d o this report--
F	NANCY	You're a reporter?
F	PHIL	Weatherman. Channel 9, Pittsburgh.
F	NANCY	Right, I should've known--
F	PHIL	But maybe after we could --
F	NANCY	Yeah, yeah, I ' d like that --
M	RITA (O.C.)	Phil! Rita is calling from across the crowd. She looks at him with Oh, Phil.
F	PHIL	Oh , Rita . The woman suddenly freezes. There is a moment of silence, then Who's Rita? No one. It's just something I say when I make love. You know -- "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like "Oh, baby" or something.
F	NANCY	Oh.
F	PHIL	O-rita. Nancy laughs uncertainly. Phil switches off the light,
M	THEIR POV	Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas, Mrs. Lancaster approaches him.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Isn't it a wonderful collection?
F	PHIL	Yes, it is. You don't usually find this many trashy novels in one place.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	You can take a book up to your room if you like.
F	PHIL	No, thank you. I've actually read them all. I was just rereading some of the dirty parts. He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf. How long will you be staying with us, Mr. Connors?
F	PHIL	Indefinitely. I've already been here for 211 days.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Really? That's quite a long time, isn't it. I hope you're finding things to do in our little town. Yes, well, I'm getting a little tired of casual sex so today I thought I'd rob a bank and buy myself a really expensive car. All right, freeze!! Drop your guns J! The guards stand there frozen with terror.
F	PHIL	You guys ever been held up before? It's kind of exciting, isn't it? I guess so. Something to tell the kids about.
F	PHIL	Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil. He raises the mask and shows his face.
M	FIRST GUARD	Herman.
M	S E C O N D GUARD	Felix.
F	PHIL	Herman and Felix. Okay. Take it easy, boys. And thanks. The frightened guards watch as Phil makes off with two large
M	SALESMAN	A real beauty, huh. We picked it u p at a--
F	PHIL	I'll take it. How much?
M	SALESMAN	Well, the sticker says $62,999 bu t if you want--
F	PHIL	I'll tell you what. I'll give you $70,000 if you just knock off the car salesman stuff and let me get out of here with my car. The Salesman gawks as Phil opens his briefcase and starts A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver
M	LARAINE	I thought we were going to a costume party.
F	PHIL	Yeah, we are, we are. But first I have this movie theater fantasy I want to talk to you about. He escorts her into the theater. Phil waves at her and points to the colorful new heart pierced Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm
F	PHIL	Yeah, but eventually you' d just get tired of screwing around and then you'd want a real relationship, wouldn't you?
M	ANGIE	I don't know. A big German Shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them.
F	PHIL	Get down, Brunoi Someone decent, someone who you respected, who respects you.
M	ANGIE	I guess so. The dog jumps up again.
F	PHIL	Down , Bruno ! It's tough to find a relationship like that, especially if your time is kind of limited. But you still have to try, don't you? Bruno! I told you! Off the bed! Phil looks over at Angle who's passed out with her mouth open
F	PHIL	There ' s got to be more to it than this.
F	RITA	You look good. I mean, it came o ut all right. How'd you know where to put the camera?
F	PHIL	Psychic. So did you have a nice evening? I just had a sandwich, watched some TV and went to bed.
F	PHIL	I got my whole body tattooed and part ied all night with some nymphomaniac biker chicks. Sounds wholesome. Were those the new 24-hour disappearing tattoos or can I see them?
F	PHIL	No, they're gone. Rita, if you only had one day to live, what would you do with it? She switches off the videotape and steps out of the van.
F	RITA	I don't know, Phil. What are you dying of?
F	PHIL	No, I mean like what if the entire world was about to explode?
F	RITA	I ' d just want to know where to p ut the camera. What are you looking for, Phil-- a date for the weekend? She starts walking toward the center of town. Phil sticks
F	PHIL	No, I just want to know you better. What do you like, what do you want, what do you think about, what kind of men are you interested in, what do you do for fun?
F	RITA	Is this real or are you just going to make me feel like a fool?
F	PHIL	I'm just trying to talk to you like a normal person. Isn't this how normal people talk?
F	RITA	Close.
F	PHIL	Okay, so talk to me. C'mon, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
F	RITA	I guess I want what everybody wants-- you know, career, love, marriage, children. So far I don't have any of it.
F	PHIL	You have a career.
F	RITA	I have a job. Doing stories on the Punxsutawney groundhog is not my ultimate goal. No offense.
F	PHIL	How about the other stuff? You seeing anybody?
F	RITA	This is getting too personal. I don't think I ' m ready to discuss these things with you. What about you? What do you want?
F	PHIL	What I really want is someone like you.
F	RITA	O h , please--
F	PHIL	Why not?
F	RITA	Phil, you know, you have so much talent and ability. If you'd just drop the attitude and act like a decent human being, then maybe I ' d -- You'd what?
F	RITA	I don't know what.
F	PHIL	Then maybe you'd like me? She stares hard at him.
F	RITA	I don't know. It's sort of like the way I feel about UFO's. I'd have to see it to believe it. Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
M	LARRY	You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather.
F	RITA	Yeah, I'll be right out, Larry. Larry scowls at Phil and exits.
F	PHIL	Why don't you stay for a while? The road's going to be closed anyway. Do you really want to be stuck in the van with Larry for three hours?
F	RITA	I've got to get back. I'll see you later. Phil watches Rita exit.
M	PHIL'S POV	Rita gets in the news van and drives off with Larry.
F	PHIL	Well, you heard it right from the groundhog's mouth. Bundle up good, 'cause it's going to be a long winter-- at least in Punxsutawney. Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors. Larry stops tape.
F	RITA	That was great. How did you know I have to go now. There's something I have to do.
F	PHIL	Oh, hi, Rita. You still here? The van won't start. Larry's working on it. Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a drink?
F	RITA	Okay.
F	PHIL	Jack Daniels.
M	BARTENDER	For you, miss?
F	RITA	Tequila,with lime. Gold, if you've got it. Phil nods to himself. Phil walks in and sits next to Rita.
F	PHIL	Oh, hi, Rita. You still here? The van won't start. Larry's working on it.
F	PHIL	Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a drink?
F	RITA	Okay.
F	PHIL	Tequila with lime, gold if you've got it. Rita looks at Phil, surprised.
M	BARTENDER	For you miss?
F	RITA	Same for me, please. The BARTENDER pours.
F	PHIL	What should we toast to?
F	RITA	Your call.
F	PHIL	To the groundhog! Rita stares for a moment.
F	RITA	I always drink to world peace.
M	BARTENDER	Take your order?
F	PHIL	Tequila with lime, gold if you've got it. Rita looks at Phil.
M	, BARTENDER	For you, miss?
F	RITA	Same for me, please. The BARTENDER pours. Phil lifts his glass.
F	PHIL	To world peace. Rita smiles, reevaluating him.
F	RITA	To world peace. They clink glasses.
F	PHIL	You like your job?
F	RITA	It's okay. I think it could be really challenging. Of course it's about a million miles from where I started out in college.
F	PHIL	You weren't in broadcasting?
F	RITA	At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh. "Believe it or not, I studied Nineteenth Century French Poetry.
F	PHIL	Really? What a waste of time. Rita looks offended. Phil knows he made a mistake.
F	PHIL	You weren't in broadcasting?
F	RITA	At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh. Believe it or not, I studied Nineteenth Century French Poetry. Phil leans in closer to her.
F	PHIL	La fille qui j'aimera Sera comme bon vin Qui se bonifiera Un peut chaque matin. Rita smiles, entranced.
F	RITA	This is terrific.
F	PHIL	Best fudge in town.
F	RITA	How do you know so much about Punxsutawney?
F	PHIL	I like small towns. I think they engender real community more than big cities.
F	RITA	That is so true! I've always thought that, too.
F	PHIL	No kidding. Here-- try the white chocolate.
F	RITA	Oh, yuk, don't make me sick.
F	PHIL	No white chocolate.
F	RITA	There's something so familiar about this. Do you ever have deja vu? Phil smiles. Then Larry enters.
M	LARRY	I don't believe it. Someone bought every distributor cap in this town. We're going to be stuck here all night1 Over Phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, "I Can't Get A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a Phil and Rita are walking slowly, very close.
F	PHIL	What?
F	RITA	I ' m just amazed. And I'm not easily amazed.
F	PHIL	About what? How you can start a day with one kind of expectation and end up so completely different.
F	PHIL	Do you like how this day is turning out?
F	RITA	Yes. I like it very much. They stop dn front of Phil's hotel. She turns to him.
F	RITA	You could never have planned a day like this, but it couldn't have been more perfect.
F	PHIL	You're wrong. I've been planning this day for weeks. Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her
F	RITA	Thanks. See you tomorrow.
F	PHIL	Tomorrow? Wait, aren't you going to come up to my room for a while?
F	RITA	I don't know, Phil--
F	PHIL	No·reason to end a perfect day. Well-- we better not.
F	PHIL	No, you should. The, uh, the poetry! I've got some books, Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could l ig ht a fire-- Thanks, but --
F	PHIL	Please come, Rita. It'll be -- Phil, I'm tired. We can be together tomorrow.
F	PHIL	But there is no tomorrow for me! Let's not ruin it, Phil. There's no way I ' m sleeping with you tonight.
F	PHIL	Why not? Rita, I love you!
F	RITA	You don't even know me!
F	PHIL	Please! You have to! Rita shakes loose from his grasp.
F	RITA	What's wrong with you! There is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old
F	RITA	Oh, no. I can't believe I fell for it. This whole day was just one long set-up. And I ate fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge.
F	PHIL	No, it was real. I love you.
F	RITA	Stop saying that! Do you really expect me to trust you? The whole secretarial pool is a Phil Connors recovery group.
F	PHIL	But I can change! I really can-- Rita slaps him hard on the cheek.
F	RITA	That's for making me care about you. She turns and stomps off, leaving Phil standing there hurting. Rita comes to her window and looks out. She sees Phil looking Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's cooooold out there today. Phil continues the radio report at his own pace, obviously It's cold out there everyday. What is this -- Miami Beach? Haw. Not hardly. And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing.
F	PHIL	Hi, Nancy. Hi. Do I know you? Phil can't manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again.
F	PHIL	No, I guess not. I thought you were someone else. Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the
F	RITA	Are you all right, Phil? You look terrible. Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away. I ' m fine. The balls CRACK as the cue ball breaks the rack.
M	FIRST HUSTLER	Who is this guy?
M	SECOND HUSTLER	I don't know. Hey, mister-- Who are you, anyway? Phil shoots, sinks a tough one.
F	PHIL	You don't know me? I've been playing here every day for two months.
M	FIRST HUSTLER	Oh, yeah? So how come I ain't seen you?
F	PHIL	I don't know. I seen you.
M	SECOND HUSTLER	So what's your name?
F	PHIL	They call me-- Punxsutawney Phil.
M	SECOND HUSTLER	Punxsutawney Phil? Like the groundhog.
F	PHIL	Yeah, like the groundhog. Phil sinks another one. This is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to civilization. With one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest control agencies, a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania, Mecca to thousands of people who, if they hated the winter so damned much, why don't they move to Florida, anyway? The program JEOPARDY! is playing.
M	ALEX TREBECK	Nobel prize-winning co- discoverers of the DNA molecule.
M	PHIL (O.C.)	Who are Watson and Crick.
M	CONTESTANT	Who are Watson and Crick?
M	ALEX	Correct. There is a cheering from a small group of people off-screen.
M	ALEX	Twin brother and sister Sebastian and Olivia create confusion in this Shakespearean comedy.
F	PHIL	What is "Twelfth Night."
M	CONTESTANT	What is "Twelfth Night?"
M	ALEX	Correct. More cheering from the small group.
M	CONTESTANT	I'll take New Jersey for eight hundred, Alex. And the answer is-- an audio daily double.
F	PHIL	Count Basie.
F	PHIL	Two thousand six hundred and s e ve n ty -o n e-- two thousand six hundred and se v en t y -t w o -- two thousand six hundred and seventy-thr-ee-^- A woman passes walking her dog.
F	PHIL	Hey, pick up after your dog!
M	DOG WALKER	He hasn't done anything.
F	PHIL	He's going to! There and there. And there! Phil continues walking, counting the sidewalk cracks. THREE
M	IPHIL	Two thousand six hundred and seventy-four, two thousand six hundred and seventy-five, two
M	JOEY	Five million eight hundred--
F	PHIL	S i x hundred--
M	MIKE AND SUE	Ninety, twenty, four, six, fifty--
F	PHIL	Two thousand, four hundred--
M	JOEY, MIKE AND SUE	Two, eight, nine, forty-six-- Phil stops. He has lost count. His lip curls up like an
M	COP	You got a problem, buddy?
F	PHIL	Yeah, I got a problem, buddy! I can't stand this place anymore! I can't stand this street and I can't stand the fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad weather and the "quaint" little shops and most of all, I can't stand anything-- ANYTHING-- with a groundhog on it. He rips a groundhog patch off the cop's jacket sleeve. Okay. Then let's see what we can do about getting you out of here. You got a name?
F	PHIL	Phil.
M	COP	Phil. Like the groundhog! Phil turns to the cop like a rabid dog, ready to strike.
F	PHIL	Yeah, like the-- --groundhog. Some big new idea has formed in his mind. Rita is looking at Phil as Larry videotapes his report.
M	LARRY	The guy's nuts. He's out of his gourd.
F	RITA	Let him finish, then I'll call the station. They turn back to watch Phil's wrap-up.
F	PHIL	There is no way this winter is ever going to end as long as that groundhog keeps seeing his shadow everyday. I don't see any other way out. He's got to be stopped and I've got to stop him. For Channel 9 news, this is Phil Connors.
M	WOMAN	He ain't there. Phil doesn't move. He-doesn't care that she sees him.
M	WOMAN	You can wait all night, but he ain't coming out. He don't live there. They keep him in the library. Phil's gun droops. The woman begins to walk off, then stops.
M	WOMAN	Plug him once for me. Phil heads right for it. The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled
M	PHIL'S POV	The groundhog looks right into his sights. The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.
M	BYSTANDER	Is he all right?
M	LIBRARIAN	He's just fine. That's two inches of bullet-proof glass there. You can't be too careful in this day and age. Phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his Rita and Larry videotape the incident, aghast at Phil's insane
F	RITA	Where were you this morning? How could you possibly miss the shoot?
F	PHIL	I've come to the end of me, Rita. There's only one way out now. Just remember/we had a wonderful day together once. Phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the In a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow,
M	B USTER	There you go, ol' buddy. Good job. Hey! He smiled at me. See that?
M	FIRST OFFICIAL	Right.
F	BUSTER	There, little fella. The other official looks up and sees Phil walking toward them
M	OTHER OFFICIAL	Hi, there, mister. Something I can do you for? Without a word, Phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup
M	FIRST OFFICIAL	Hey! What 're you -- ! Phil drives off in Buster's truck. Rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs back toward the Larry! Buster and his aides race for another car parked nearby.
F	BUSTER	Jake! Call the police, and get the word out. Somebody kidnapped Phil. We're going after him. Come on, Tommy! They jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly.
F	RITA	Let's go! Phil just snatched the groundhog! Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the Probably some kind of gerbil deal. Pervert.
F	PHIL	Coming to the end of the trail, Phil. Then we're going out in a blaze of glory.
F	BUSTER	Nobody takes my groundhog and gets away with it.
F	RITA	What is he doing? What can he be thinking? He must1 ve just -- snapped. Larry squeezes into the passenger seat with the camera mounted
M	LARRY	This oughta be good.
F	BUSTER	Okay! I know this road. There's no way off ' cept the way we come up.
M	FIRST OFFICIAL	All right! We got him now.
F	PHIL	Okay, pal. It's showtime. Phil hits the gas. The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it
F	PHIL	He slowly opens his eyes and blinks. He looks around and
F	PHIL	Ah, nuts! Phil throws off the covers and hurls himself out of bed. They rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three
M	D RIVERS' POV	He sees Phil through the windshield but doesn't even have time
M	A TV SCREEN	A woman in some horror movie is screaming.
M	REVEAL	Mrs. Lancaster is watching TV in the parlor of the hotel. In A few moments pass. We hear the zap of an electrocution, the lights and TV flicker Rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while Larry In the shadowy darkness under the sheet, a CLICK is heard and
F	RITA	I ' m sorry. What was that again?
F	PHIL	I'm a god.
F	RITA	You're God?
F	PHIL	No, I'm A god. Not THE God-- at least I don't think I am.
F	RITA	That's reassuring. For a mintute there I thought you might be crazy.
F	PHIL	No, it's true. It's the only possible explanation. I'm a supernatural being.
F	RITA	Because you survived a car wreck?
M	WAITER	Are you ready to order?
F	PHIL	Not just the car wreck! I didn't just blow up yesterday, you know. I've been run over, drowned, crushed, stabbed, shot, electrocuted, poisoned, frozen, burn ed, and asphyxiated--
F	RITA	Really? The waiter looks at him like he's nuts.
F	PHIL	--but I always wake up the next day without a scratch, without even a headache. I'm telling you, I ' m immortal.
M	WAITER	The special today is blueberry waffles.
F	RITA	Why are you telling me this? Because some people like blueberry waffles.
F	RITA	No t you-- him.
F	PHIL	Because I want you to believe in me.
F	RITA	You're not a god, Phil. Take my word for it. This is twelve years of Catholic school talking.
M	WAITER	I could come back if you're not ready.
F	PHIL	How do you know I'm not a god?
F	RITA	Please.
F	PHIL	How do you know?
F	RITA	Because it's not possible.
M	WAITER	I'll come back. The /waiter turns to leave.
F	PHIL	Hey, Billy! The waiter turns back.
F	PHIL	This is Bill. He's been a waiter for three years because he left Penn State and had to find work. He likes the town, he paints toy soldiers, and he's gay.
M	WAITER	I am notl Phil grabs an astonished Rita and pulls her over to the next
F	RITA	What are you doing?
F	PHIL	This is Doris Kleiser and her fiance Fred.
F	DORIS	Do I know you?
F	PHIL	They're supposed to get married tonight but Doris is having second thoughts.
M	FRED	What! Doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded. Rita is a
F	RITA	Lovely ring.
F	DORIS	Thanks.
F	PHIL	This is Ralph. Say "Hi," Rita. Rita flashes a quick smile.
M	RALPH	Don't believe I've had the--
F	PHIL	Ralph hates his life here and wants to drive around town smashing into policemen.
M	RALPH	Well, who don't?
F	RITA	This is some kind of trick.
F	PHIL	Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the real God cheats, too. Maybe God isn't omnipotent-- he's just had a lot of practice.
F	RITA	How about that guy?
F	PHIL	Tom. Worked in the coal mine ·til they shut it down.
F	RITA	Her?
M	PHIL '	Nancy. Went to Lincoln High School in Pittsburgh. Takes herself out to lunch once a week. Rita is getting very bewildered. From their reactions she can
F	RITA	How do you know these people!
F	PHIL	I told you the truth. In five seconds there's going to be a grease fire in the kitchen. Five, four--
F	RITA	This is nuts.
F	PHIL	--three, two, one. Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the
F	RITA	Okay, enough. Let's just sit down and think for a second. What do you know about me, Phil? Do you know me, too? Phil takes a long pause.
F	PHIL	I know all about you, Rita. I know you like producing, but hope for better than Channel 9, Pittsburgh.
F	RITA	Everyone knows that.
F	PHIL	You like boats but not the ocean. There's a lake you go to in the summer with your family, up in the mountains, with an old wooden dock and a boathouse with boards missing in the roof, and a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone, and at night you'd look up and see the stars. You're a sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon Brando, and French poetry. You're wonderfully generous; you're kind to strangers, and children; and when you stand in the snow, you look like an angel.
F	RITA	How are you doing this?
F	PHIL	I told you! I wake up every day right here, right in Punxsutawney, and it's always February second and I can't turn it off. If you still don't bel iev e me, listen--
F	RITA	B u t , Phil--
F	PHIL	Listen! In ten seconds Larry is going to walk through that door and take you away from me.
F	RITA	Larry?
F	PHIL	But you can't let him. Please believe me. You've got to believe me.
F	RITA	I don't -- Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots
F	PHIL	Look. As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil grabs a pen and pad
M	LARRY	You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather. Phil hands the paper to Rita. She reads it. " . . . stay ahead of the weather. " Larry looks at the paper.
M	LARRY	What ' s that? Rita looks at Phil with new understanding and empathy.
F	PHIL	Afer I got over the shock, it was kind of fun for the first year or two. I had anything I wanted. Except you, of course. Phil abruptly pulls Rita aside. A big pile of snow slides off
F	RITA	How did this start?
F	PHIL	I don't know. I just woke up. Just like always. NED RY-ERSON approaches.
M	NED	Hey, Phil! Phil Connors 1
F	PHIL	Rita, this is Ned Ryerson. He's an asshole.
M	NED	He remembers me! Phil and Rita keep walking. Rita looks back at Ned, perplexed
F	PHIL	Trust me on that one.
F	RITA	This is great.
F	PHIL	No, it isn't. You hate fudge.
M	. RITA	Just how well do we know each other?
F	PHIL	I told you. I know everybody. Rita stops walking.
F	RITA	Did we ever...you know? Did we ever! You were an animal.
F	RITA	Come on.
F	PHIL	You're European trained, aren't you. Phil continues walking. Phil! It's not funny. She catches up to him. Phil turns to her.
F	PHIL	You weren't interested. Okay. She begins walking again.
F	RITA	Not that it would've been so awful.
F	PHIL	I understand.
F	RITA	I just had to know whether to smack you or not.
F	PHIL	You did.
F	RITA	Good.
F	PHIL	So do you believe any of this?
F	RITA	I don't know. I don't know how else you could know so much. Maybe it is really happening.
F	PHIL	I used to try to stay up all night sometimes. I thought if I could stay conscious I could figure out what was going on, or at least hang onto something from the day before. But I gave up on that a long time ago. Rita looks at him with compassion.
F	RITA	It sounds so-- lonely.
F	PHIL	It's not that bad. You get used to it. Rita comes to a decision.
F	RITA	Maybe I should spend the rest of the day with you-- as an objective witness. Just to see what happens. Okay?
F	PHIL	Yeah, sure. That'd be okay.
F	PHIL	It's not in the wrist so much as the fingers. Be the hat.
F	RITA	It would take me a year to get good at this.
F	PHIL	Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five hours a day.
F	RITA	Is this what you do with eternity? Now you know. It's like waiting for a bus that never comes . You should see me play pool -- and bowling, juggling, hacky sack. I can ride a unicycle. There ' s a knock on the door .
F	PHIL	I'll get it! Phil jumps for the door and opens it. The PIZZA GUY is there.
F	PHIL	Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the delivery charge, right?
M	PIZZA GUY	U h hh h -- Phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door.
F	RITA	MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My favorite .
F	PHIL	Of course. I told you, I know everything .
F	RITA	I don ' t think I ' d want to know everything that ' s going to happen. I like to be surprised.
F	PHIL	That's not the worst part.
F	RITA	What's the worst part?
F	PHIL	The worst part is starting over everyday. Tomorrow you won't remember any of this. You'll go back to treating me like a complete jerk --
F	RITA	No --
F	PHIL	It's not your fault. I am a jerk.
F	RITA	No, you're not.
F	PHIL	Okay, I ' m not. It really doesn't make a lot of difference. I've killed myself so many times, I don't even exist anymore. I'm just completely empty.
F	RITA	Or completely clean.
F	PHIL	If you're going to be this positive all the time I may have to rough you up a little.
F	RITA	Wait! Have we done this before?
F	PHIL	Which part?
F	RITA	You getting me up here, the card gam e, the pizza--
F	PHIL	No, this is the first time. Well?
F	PHIL	Well, what?
F	RITA	Well how does it feel to be doing something completely new? Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude.
F	PHIL	Good. Really good. He takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto. There's only one slice left. Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not
F	RITA	Sometimes I wish I had a thousand lifetimes. One to be a great journalist. One to, I don't know, go back to school, study art, or auto mechanics. One just to take care of all the busywork, you know, pay the bills, get my car tuned up. One to be the wild woman of Borneo. One to be Mother Theresa. Maybe it's not a curse, Phil. It all just depends on how you look at it. Phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in. Then
F	RITA	I want you to know, it's been a really nice day for me.
F	PHIL	Me, too.
F	RITA	Maybe, if it's not too boring for you, we could do it again.
F	PHIL	I hope so. The clock reads 11:59. Rita grabs Phil's hand. He puts his They look into each others' eyes. Rita gives Phil a reassuring Rita looks up at Phil as if expecting some magical event.
F	RITA	You're still here!
F	PHIL	I know.
F	RITA	I thought you were supposed to disappear-- or I was or something.
F	PHIL	Not 'til six.
F	RITA	You rat! She is mad in a playful way.
F	PHIL	I never said midnight--
F	RITA	You knew I was waiting for midnight!
F	PHIL	But I never said it.
F	RITA	Oh, I can't believe you! I didn't know this was going to take all night!
F	PHIL	Does that mean you're going?
F	RITA	No. Phil takes Rita's hand. She doesn't resist.
M	LATER	Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the bed, her head
F	RITA	I'm sorry.
F	PHIL	It's okay to go to sleep you know. I promise I won't touch you-- much.
F	RITA	No, it's all right. I'm not tired. What were you saying? Her eyes start to close again.
F	PHIL	I was saying that the cow was eventually returned to it's rightful owner.
F	RITA	Really? That's right. He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers
F	PHIL	What I was going to say was, I think you're the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most wonderful girl I ever met in my life. She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.
F	PHIL	Shhhh. That's good. I could never tell you this, but from the first minute I looked at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever. iEverytime I -saw you around the station, I thought my heart was going to explode. I used to dream about us being together. In my dream you loved me as much as I loved you and we didn't have to say anything but I knew you understood everything. She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep
F	PHIL	I know a guy like me could never deserve to have someone like you, but if I did, I swear I would love you for the rest of my life. Rita opens her eyes. Did you say something?
F	PHIL	Good-night, Rita. He kisses her gently on the forehead.
F	RITA	Good-night, Phil. The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing. Phil arrives, carrying two cups of coffee.
F	PHIL	Rita? She looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the
F	RITA	Oh, hi, Phil.
F	PHIL	Thought you might like some-- He hands her the coffee.
F	RITA	Thanks!
F	PHIL	Careful, it's hot. Larry? He hands Larry a cup.
M	LARRY	Yeah, great.
F	RITA	We're just setting up.
F	PHIL	You know, I bumped into Buster Greene, he kind of runs this thing, and he tipped me off that we might get a better shot over there.
F	RITA	Really?
F	PHIL	I mean, maybe we should go for it. What do you think?
F	RITA	Sounds good to me. Larry?
M	LARRY	Sure, why not?
F	RITA	All right. Thanks, Phil. Good work. She reaches for an equipment case.
F	PHIL	I'll get that. Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear.
F	PHIL	You and I never talk, Larry. You got kids? Larry looks suspicious. Rita looks on, reevaluating Phil.
F	PHIL	Where would I find the Philosophy section?
M	LIBRARIAN	Down and to the left, 600's. Phil walks through the stacks, past the groundhog window.
M	MARY	Yes?
F	PHIL	I ' d like a piano lesson, please.
M	MARY	Oh. Okay, I ' m with a student now, but --
F	PHIL	I'll give you a thousand dollars. Mary hesitates only a moment, then ushers Phil into the house A moment later the door opens and a LITTLE GIRL with an armloa
M	CHUBBY MAN	Morning.
F	PHIL	Buon Giorno, signore.
M	CHUBBY MAN	Think it ' 11 be an early Spring?
F	PHIL	"Winter slumbering in the open air wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring."
M	CHUBBY MAN	Oh.
M	MARY	Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say this is your first lesson?
F	PHIL	Technically, yes. Phil plays on, definitely improving.
F	PHIL	In fact, the groundhog's legendary ability to predict the weather may be more than just the German folklore of the region. Higher temperatures trigger hormonal changes in the testosterone levels of male groundhogs, which may in fact wake them from hibernation and send them out to battle with other males ;for mating rights. So, the truth is they're not looking for their shadows, they're looking for groundhog chicks. Rita looks on, clearly delighted with the report.
F	PHIL	Groundhog Day, February second, also known as Candlemas Day or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, the day Mary first came to the temple for ritual blessings following the birth of the infant Jesus, and celebrated since the Middle Ages by the sacramental lighting of candles. Hence the old Scottish couplet which long predates the .American groundhog tradition: "If Candlemas dawns bright and clear, there'll be two winters in the year." Larry whispers an aside to Rita.
M	LARRY	Is he making this stuff up? Shhhhh. Behind him, Phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble, Rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea
F	PHIL	But what if the rules changed? What if none of your actions had consequences?
F	RITA	There would still be an absolute morality. There has to be an absolute good, regardless of the circumstances.
F	PHIL	Oh, is that so, Miss Plato? Then let me ask you this. Where does this "absolute good" come from? From the sky?
F	RITA	I don't know. From my freshman Philosophy course, I guess. They both laugh. Then she looks at him for a long moment and
F	PHIL	What?
F	RITA	Nothing. I just can't believe you're such a fine sculptor. Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.
F	PHIL	I gotta go.
F	RITA	Where do you have to go in Punxsutawney?
F	PHIL	I got piano and then drums.
F	RITA	Here?
F	PHIL	Come on, I'll drop you off. They exit. Across the street, Rita takes a wistful glance toward Phil,
M	NED	Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you!
F	PHIL	Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don't believe it. I've missed you so much.
M	NED	Uh, I gotta get going. Nice to see you, Phil. He hurries off.
M	MARY	How long have you been studying, Mr. Connors?
F	PHIL	One day. I'm gifted.
F	PHIL	Hey, mister. Hey. Come on, let's get you somewhere warm. The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his eyes.
F	PHIL	There you go. Phil practically carries him out of the alley.
M	NURSE	You the one brought in the old man? How is he?
M	NURSE	He passed away just now. Phil pauses for a long moment.
F	PHIL	What'd he die of? He was just old. It was his time.
F	PHIL	I want to see his chart. Excuse me. Phil brushes past her and makes for the big double doors
M	NURSE	Sir, you can't -- Look! Some people just die!
F	PHIL	Not on my watch.
F	PHIL	Come on . Hang on . Hang on , there . Breathe .
F	PHIL	...When Chekhov saw the long winter, it was a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope; and yet, we know winter's only one more step in the cycle. And standing among the people of Punxsutawney -- -- basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts, I couldn't imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter. Phil smiles. Rita smiles, too.
F	PHIL	For Channel 9 news, I ' m Phil Connors. There is much applause. Even Larry brushes away a tear.
F	PHIL	Sorry. I'm gonna be late. Phil rushes off.
F	RITA	Late for what? Phil? Could you break it down and wrap out of here by yourself, Larry?
M	LARRY	Sure .
F	RITA	Thanks . MARIE, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second
F	PHIL	Hey! Did you forget to look both ways? You didn't even look one way.
M	MARIE	My doggie was cold.
F	PHIL	Yeah, well, my doggies are freezing, but I ' m still gonna watch out for cars. See you around, kid. Phil looks at his watch and rushes off. TWO BUSINESSMEN are leaning over a THIRD.
M	BUSINESSMAN	Oh, my God! He's having a heart attack!
M	SECOND BUSINESSMAN	Lay him down! What do I do? He's not
M	SECOND BUSINESSMAN	He's turning blue! Help! Phil walks straight up to the BLUE-FACED MAN, grabs him from
M	FIRST BUSINESSMAN	Jerry, you okay?
M	SECOND BUSINESSMAN	I think that did it. Phil lets go of the grateful victim.
F	PHIL	If you're going to eat steak, get better teeth, will you? Enjoy the rest of your lunch, gents. He exits.
M	JERRY	Wow. Who was that guy? Phil gets to the door and finds Rita standing there, looking at
F	PHIL	Rita! -Okay, hold it right there. I want to know what' s going on and I want to know right now.
F	PHIL	I'm sorry, I'm really pressed right now. Meet me outside the hospital about 5:00 and we'll talk about it.
F	RITA	The hospital? Phil looks at his watch and rushes away.
F	PHIL	Try the curlycue fries. Killer.
M	NURSE	Looks like insulin shock. She's probably diabetic. Phil enters wearing a doctor's scrub suit and begins barking
F	PHIL	She's not diabetic. It's an overdose. Let's get her up here and pump her stomach, then I want a complete blood work-up, STAT.
M	NURSE	R i g h t , Doctor--uh-- She realizes she's never seen him before.
F	PHIL	Call me Phil.
M	NURSE	Phil. Like the groundhog?
F	PHIL	Exactly.
M	KID	Make a giraffe!
F	PHIL	A giraffe? Let's see. It's just like a dog with a biiiiig-- what was it?
M	ALL THE KIDS	Neck!
F	PHIL	A big tail? Okay, a big tail.
M	KIDS	Neck! A big neck! Phil makes an animal really quickly. Rita watches from the doorway, unseen by Phil.
F	PHIL	There. A dog with long legs.
M	KIDS	Nooo ! Long neck !
F	PHIL	Oh! Right! A dog with a big head.
M	KIDS	Noooo! The kids attack Phil. Lots of rolling around on the bed. Rita Finally, Phil extricates himself and exits to find Rita
F	RITA	All right, now what's going on?
F	PHIL	Come on. We have to hurry.
F	PHIL	That little bastard has never thanked me once . I ought to j ust let him fall. Teach him a lesson.
F	RITA	Phil, this is too -- I must be dreaming. PHIL Yeah, you and me both. Come on, We're almost done. Rita is standing by at the end of the alley, watching as Phil Phil writes something down on a small pad. He finishes, and Phil stands and walks away, as an ambulance pulls into the
F	RITA	Is he -- ?
M	. 'PHIL	Yeah. Let's go.
F	RITA	In a minute. She waits and watches. The paramedics, BUD and ANDY, get out of the ambulance and
M	BUD	It's ol1 Really.
M	ANDY	That's a shame.
M	BUD	Look here . Bud picks up the note Phil left. Rita steps closer.
F	RITA	May I see that? "Every night, by cold bricks
M	GLOW	I watch the shadow rising from this old man in the snow. At 8:02 we let it go." ANDY "At 8:02 we let it go."
M	BUD	Wow, that's nice. Rita hands him the note and quickly walks away.
M	ANDY	Suppose he wrote it? Are you kidding?
F	RITA	Now what?
F	PHIL	Come on. You'll see. They enter. People are dancing. The wedding party is dressed in rented
F	RITA	This is incredible. Who's wedding is this?
F	PHIL	Just some friends. Dorisi The bride, DORIS, young and cheery, is on her way to see Phil.
F	DORIS	Hi, Mr. Connors! Come ON, Freddy.
M	FRED	Hi.
F	DORIS	This is the guy I told you about.
M	FRED	No way!
F	PHIL	How's it going, Fred?
M	FRED	Hey, I ' d like to thank you for making Doris go through with this.
F	PHIL	Are you kidding? Don't buy that playing hard to get stuff. She's crazy about you, you stud.
F	DORIS	I ' m really glad you could come.
F	PHIL	Congratulations. Phil reaches into his pocket, pulls out two tickets and hands
F	DORIS	What is this? Oh, no way! No way! Ahhh! Doris throws herself on Fred and jumps up and down. Fred grabs
M	FRED	Wrestlemania! No way! No way! Doris throws herself on Phil.
F	DORIS	How did you know?
M	FRED	We're like going to be in Pittsburgh anyway.
F	PHIL	I don't know. I just thought about you two, tried to picture what you ' d want more than anything in the world and it came to me. Bing! Wrestlemania.
M	FRED	Thanks, Mr. Connors. You're a real pal.
F	DORIS	This is the best! Doris gives Phil a kiss. She and Fred move on.
F	RITA	I don ' t understand . You rush from one person to the next in a town you only visit once a year, you know everything before it happens , and you -- - I don ' t know , you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s leading citizen. The band finishes a set. The guests stop dancing and head for
F	PHIL	What do you want to know?
F	RITA	Who are you?
F	PHIL	I really don't know.
F	RITA	No, there's something going on with you.
F	PHIL	Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney on February second -- every day. It's supernatural. I don't even try to explain it anymore. So, I live each day as if it's the only day I've got. Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only
F	RITA	That's pretty amazing. " You want to know what's really amazing? I've been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. I dream of you every night of my life. You've been my constant weapon against total despair, and just knowing you exist has kept me alive. How's that? Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.
M	MARY	Phil! This is the guy.
F	PHIL	Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one of Punxsey's finest musicians.
M	·MARY	Give me a break. You should talk. Why don't you play something?
F	PHIL	N o , I--
M	MARY	Please.
M	FRED	Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it. Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs.
M	LEO	That's a great guy you've got there. Doctor Connors fixed my back, you know. Do ctor Connors?
F	PHIL	Wait! Don't move!
F	RITA	Making a snow man? I'll help.
F	PHIL	No, stay there. Stand right th ere. Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
F	RITA	Can I look?
F	PHIL	O kay, look. Nobody's ever done this for me. Not even a drawing. It's beautiful. This is how I see you. When it all gets too much, I just close my eyes and there you are-- just like this. Take it home and keep it in the freezer. Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into
F	PHIL	This one's for the Frog Prince.
F	RITA	What?
F	PHIL	Nothing. They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.
F	PHIL	Will you come with me? Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming
F	RITA	We're just going to leave her?
F	PHIL	It doesn't matter. Really, it doesn't. They kiss again. The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence. It's not true. It's not. It can't be true. Rita? Rita! RITA Mmmm. Morning. Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses.
F	PHIL	You're here! My god! I can't believe you're here!
F	RITA	Glad to see you, too.
F	PHIL	No! It's happened. Don't you get it? It's tomorrow! It's -- Phil turns on the radio.
M	DEEJAY	. . . still shoveling put the highways, but if you're walking, it's a beautiful day.
M	S IDEKICK	Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned e ve r yt h in g up--
M	DEEJAY	--except your mouth. Phil kisses the radio.
F	PHIL	I love those guys.
F	RITA	Are you always this jolly in the morning? Phil runs to the window and looks out. The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids
F	PHIL	No groundhog! Rita! They're all gone!
F	RITA	You must've had some dream. Phil stops, thinks.
F	PHIL	Did I just dream it? Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only
F	RITA	Phi l? Phil! Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else Yeah!!!! Phil runs back into the room.
F	PHIL	It really happened! You're really here! He pounces on Rita again.
F	PHIL	You're really actually here. I'm here, I'm here! They kiss, passionately, hungrily.
F	PHIL	Let's go! He scoops her up in his arms.
F	RITA	Where're we going?
F	PHIL	Anywhere! Everywhere!
F	MRS. LANCASTER	Oh, my! Florence! Say hello to Rita. She loves me.
F	MRS. LANCASTER	I'm not surprised. He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.
M	A MAN	Phil! Good morning!
M	A LADY	Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank you.
F	PHIL	That's all right. I-- A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.
M	FLORIST	Phil, here. I want you to have these.
F	PHIL	Thanks, Carl. Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.
M	PHIL (V.O.)	And so began my final lifetime, and ended the longest winter on record. I would find myself no longer able to affect the chain of events in this town, but I did learn something about time. You can waste time, you can kill time, you can do time, but if you use it wisely, there's never enough of it. So you'd better make the most of the time you've got. A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita Larry never got through the blizzard, so none of my groundhog reports ever made it on the air. But Rita and I-- we lived happily ever after. Phil and Rita walk off together. Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
M	NED	But Phil told me you were his accountant!
M	LARRY	Look, I told you! He's nuts! Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.
M	NED	Let me just tell you about single premium life-- Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
M	THE END
