M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ACTOR	I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for good. I'm kissin' it all goodbye, these four stinkin' walls, the six flights up, the el that roars by at three A.M. like a castiron wind. Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury! I'll miss 'em – like hell I will!
M	ACTRESS	Dreaming again!
M	ACTOR	Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now, awake for the first time in years. Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a dream if you've lived with your eyes closed. Well my eyes are open now! I see that choir, and I know they're dressed in rags! But we're part of that choir, both of us – yeah, and you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!
M	MAURY	The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be hawking the fish down on Fulton Street.
M	ACTOR	Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their hearts out.
M	MAURY	That's it, kid. Take that ruined choir. Make it sing!
M	ACTOR	So long, Maury.
M	MAURY	So long.
M	MAURY	We'll hear from that kid. And I don't mean a postcard.
M	OLDER MAN	FISH! FRESH FISH!
M	LILY	work. It's late, Maury.
M	MAURY	Not any more Lil...
M	MAURY	...It's early.
M	MAITRE 'D	Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink... several members of your party have already arrived...
M	FINK	Is Garland Stanford here?
M	MAITRE 'D	He called to say he'd be a few minutes late... Ah, here we are...
M	MAN	Barton, Barton, so glad you could make it. You know Richard St. Claire...
M	MAN	...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking champagne, dear boy, in honor of the occasion. Have you seen the Herald?
M	BARTON	Not yet.
M	MAN	Well, I don't want to embarrass you but Caven could hardly contain himself. But more important, Richard and Poppy here loved the play.
F	POPPY	Loved it! What power!
M	RICHARD	Yeah, it was a corker.
M	BARTON	Thanks, Richard, but I know for a fact the only fish you've ever seen were tacked to a the wall of the yacht club.
M	RICHARD	Ouch!
M	MAN	Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all devastated.
F	POPPY	Weeping! Copius tears! What did the Herald say?
M	MAN	I happen to have it with me.
M	BARTON	Please Derek –
F	POPPY	Do read it, do!
M	DEREK	"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the Common Man. The star of the Bare Ruined Choirs was not seen on the stage of the Belasco last night – though the thespians involved all acquitted themselves admirably. The find of the evening was the author of this drama about simple folk – fish mongers, in fact – whose brute struggle for existence cannot quite quell their longing for something higher. The playwright finds nobility in the most squalid corners and poetry in the most callused speech. A tough new voice in the American theater has arrived, and the owner of that voice is named... Barton Fink."
M	BARTON	They'll be wrapping fish in it in the morning so I guess it's not a total waste.
F	POPPY	Cynic!
M	DEREK	Well we can enjoy your success, Barton, even if you can't.
M	BARTON	Don't get me wrong – I'm glad it'll do well for you, Derek.
M	DEREK	Don't worry about me, dear boy – I want you to celebrate.
M	BARTON	All right, but I can't start listening to the critics, and I can't kid myself about my own work. A writer writes from his gut, and his gut tells him what's good and what's... merely adequate.
F	POPPY	Well I don't pretend to be a critic, but Lord, I have a gut, and it tells me it was simply marvelous.
M	RICHARD	And a charming gut it is.
F	POPPY	You dog!
M	RICHARD	Aaa-woooooooo!
M	BARTON	I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
M	GARLAND	Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute. What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
M	BARTON	The play was marvelous. She wept, copiously. Millions of dollars and no sense.
M	GARLAND	We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles. Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
M	BARTON	To do what?
M	GARLAND	What do you do far a living?
M	BARTON	I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
M	GARLAND	Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out. Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
M	BARTON	To see pap.
M	GARLAND	Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
M	BARTON	I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
M	GARLAND	I'd say you're already enjoying some.
M	BARTON	No, Garland, don't you see? Not the kind of success where the critics fawn over you or the producers like Derek make a lot of money. No, a real success – the success we've been dreaming about – the creation of a new, living theater of, about, and for the common man! If I ran off to Hollywood now I'd be making money, going to parties, meeting the big shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself off from the wellspring of that success, from the common man.
M	BARTON	...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
M	GARLAND	Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
M	GARLAND	...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
M	BARTON	No, what did it say?
M	GARLAND	Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash – strike that, a lot of cash.
M	GARLAND	...The common man'll still be here when you get back. What the hell, they might even have one or two of 'em out in Hollywood.
M	BARTON	...That's a rationalization, Garland.
M	GARLAND	Barton, it was a joke.
M	CLERK	Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
M	BARTON	I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
M	CLERK	F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
M	BARTON	Must be.
M	CLERK	Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
M	CLERK	...Are you a tranz or a rez?
M	BARTON	Excuse me?
M	CLERK	Transient or resident?
M	BARTON	I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
M	CLERK	Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
M	BARTON	Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
M	CLERK	Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
M	CLERK	...Though we provide privacy for the residential guest, we are also a full service hotel including complimentary shoe shine. My name is Chet.
M	CLERK	...Okay
M	BARTON	Huh?
M	CLERK	Okey-dokey, go ahead.
M	BARTON	What –
M	CLERK	Don't you wanna go to your room?!
M	BARTON	...What number is it?
M	CLERK	...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell you.
M	CLERK	...Those your only bags?
M	BARTON	The others are being sent.
M	CLERK	I'll keep an eye out for them. I'll keep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.
M	BARTON	...Six, please.
M	ELEVATOR MAN	Next stop: Six.
M	VOICE	How d'ya like your room!
M	BARTON	...Who is this?
M	VOICE	Chet!
M	BARTON	...Who?
M	VOICE	Chet! From downstairs!
M	VOICE	...How d'ya like your room!
M	MAN	Is that him?! Barton Fink?! Lemme put my arms around this guy!
M	MAN	...How the hell are ya? Good trip?
M	MAN	My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this dump. You know that – you read the papers.
M	MAN	Lou treating you all right? Got everything you need? What the hell's the matter with your face? What the hell's the matter with his face, Lou?
M	BARTON	It's not as bad as it looks; just a mosquito in my room –
M	LIPNIK	Place okay?
M	LIPNIK	...Where did we put him?
M	BARTON	I'm at the Earle.
M	LIPNIK	Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
M	BARTON	Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
M	LIPNIK	Less Hollywood? Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer. ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
M	LOU	Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr. Lipnik.
M	LIPNIK	How's about it, Bart?
M	BARTON	To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
M	LIPNIK	That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart? Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay. The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
M	BARTON	...Yes, thank you.
M	LIPNIK	Lou.
M	LIPNIK	...He used to have shares in the company. An ownership interest. Got bought out in the twenties – muscled out according to some. Hell, according to me. So we keep him around, he's got a family. Poor schmuck. He's sensitive, don't mention the old days. Oh hell, say whatever you want. Look, barring a preference, Bart, we're gonna put you to work on a wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I say this because they tell me you know the poetry of the street. That would rule out westerns, pirate pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...
M	LIPNIK	But look, I'm not one of these guys thinks poetic has gotta be fruity. We're together on that, aren't we? I mean I'm from New York myself – well, Minsk if you wanna go way back, which we won't if you don't mind and I ain't askin'. Now people're gonna tell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, it's a B picture. You tell them, bullshit. We don't make B pictures here at Capitol. Let's put a stop to that rumor right now.
M	LIPNIK	...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
M	LOU	Excellent picture.
M	LIPNIK	We got a treatment on it yet?
M	LOU	No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
M	LIPNIK	Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill. Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest? Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
M	LIPNIK	...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
M	BARTON	...Both maybe?
M	LOU	...Maybe we should do a treatment.
M	LIPNIK	Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it. He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades. Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
M	LIPNIK	...Heard about your show, by the way. My man in New York saw it. Tells me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty damn moving. A little fruity, he said, but I guess you know what you're doing. Thank you for your heart. We need more heart in pictures. We're all expecting great things.
M	BARTON	Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's someone in the room next door to mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... making a lot of... noise.
M	BARTON	...Thank you.
M	MAN	Did you... Somebody just complained...
M	BARTON	No, I didn't – I mean, I did call down, not to complain exactly, I was just concerned that you might – not that it's my business, but that you might be in some kind of... distress. You see, I was trying to work, and it's, well, it was difficult –
M	MAN	Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered you. The damn walls here, well, I just apologize like hell...
M	MAN	...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess we're neighbors...
M	BARTON	Barton Fink.
M	CHARLIE	Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
M	BARTON	That's all right, really, thank you.
M	CHARLIE	All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
M	CHARLIE	... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
M	BARTON	Okay... a quick one, sure...
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
M	BARTON	That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
M	CHARLIE	What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
M	BARTON	Well, I'm a writer, actually.
M	CHARLIE	You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
M	BARTON	Can be. Not easy, but –
M	CHARLIE	Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
M	BARTON	And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
M	CHARLIE	Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
M	CHARLIE	...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
M	BARTON	Doesn't surprise me at all.
M	CHARLIE	Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
M	BARTON	Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
M	CHARLIE	What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
M	BARTON	No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
M	CHARLIE	Pictures! Jesus!
M	CHARLIE	...I'm sorry, brother, I was just sitting here thinking I was talking to some ambitious youngster, eager to make good. Hell, you've got it made! Writing for pictures! Beating out that competition! And me being patronizing!
M	CHARLIE	...Is the egg showing or what?!
M	BARTON	That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
M	CHARLIE	Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
M	BARTON	That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
M	CHARLIE	Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
M	BARTON	What do I write about?
M	CHARLIE	Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
M	BARTON	Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
M	CHARLIE	Well ain't that a kick in the head!
M	BARTON	Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
M	BARTON	...I don't guess this means much to you.
M	CHARLIE	Hell, I could tell you some stories–
M	BARTON	And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
M	CHARLIE	I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
M	BARTON	Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there? Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
M	CHARLIE	I can feel my butt getting sore already.
M	BARTON	Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
M	CHARLIE	And I could tell you some stories –
M	BARTON	Sure you could! And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
M	BARTON	Frequently played, seldom remarked.
M	CHARLIE	Whatever that means.
M	BARTON	You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
M	CHARLIE	Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
M	BARTON	Well, we've got something in common then.
M	CHARLIE	Well Christ, if there's any way I can contribute, or help, or whatever–
M	BARTON	Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
M	CHARLIE	Well, I can tell you some stories –
M	CHARLIE	...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
M	BARTON	See you, Charlie.
M	BARTON	He looks around to the opposite – bed – wall.
M	EXECUTIVE	I'm eating on the lot today –
M	EXECUTIVE	...Who's he?
F	SECRETARY	Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.
F	GEISLER	More please.
M	BARTON	I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
F	GEISLER	Ever act?
M	BARTON	...Huh? No, I'm –
F	GEISLER	We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
M	BARTON	I'm a writer. Ted O –
F	GEISLER	Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
M	BARTON	I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
F	GEISLER	What!? Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
M	BARTON	Then who should I talk to?
F	GEISLER	Get me Lou Breeze.
F	SECRETARY	Is he in for Mr. Geisler?
F	GEISLER	Lou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this morning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay, the reason I'm calling, I got a writer here, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm producing that Wallace Beery wrestling picture – what'm I, the goddamn janitor around here?... Yeah, well who'd you get that from?... Yeah, well tell Lipnik he can kiss my dimpled ass... Shit! No, alright... No, no, all right.
F	GEISLER	...Okay kid, let's chow.
F	GEISLER	Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
M	BARTON	But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
F	GEISLER	Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
M	BARTON	Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
F	GEISLER	Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
F	GEISLER	...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
M	BARTON	Who?
F	GEISLER	Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll hit one. And do me a favor, Fink: Throw it hard.
M	MAN	Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.
M	BARTON	Barton Fink.
M	BARTON	...Jesus. W.P.!
M	MAYHEW	I beg your pardon?
M	BARTON	W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
M	MAYHEW	Just Bill, please.
M	BARTON	Bill!...
M	BARTON	...You're the finest novelist of our time.
M	MAYHEW	Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein' occupied here in the worship of Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet to see your play –
M	MAYHEW	...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the news reaches us in Hollywood.
M	BARTON	Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
M	MAYHEW	All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
M	MAYHEW	...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
M	BARTON	It's still a little early for me.
M	MAYHEW	So be it.
M	BARTON	...Bill, if I'm imposing you should say so, I know you're very busy – I just, uh... I just wonder if I could ask you a favor... That is to say, uh... have you ever written a wrestling picture?
M	MAYHEW	...You are drippin', suh.
M	MAYHEW	...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew has not, at one time or othuh, been invited to essay. I have taken my stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I have stabbed at so many others, and with as little success. I gather that you are a fresh-man here, eager for an upperclassman's council. However, just at the moment...
M	MAYHEW	...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't you stop at my bungalow, which is numbah fifteen, later on this afternoon...
M	MAYHEW	...and we will discuss wrastlin' scenarios and other things lit'rary.
M	WOMAN	...Can I help you?
M	BARTON	I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this afternoon. Is he in?
M	WOMAN	Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the moment–
M	MAYHEW	HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
M	WOMAN	Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. Mayhew's personal secretary. I know this all must sound horrid. I really do apologize...
M	BARTON	Is, uh... Is he okay?
F	AUDREY	He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
M	MAYHEW	WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
F	AUDREY	I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
M	BARTON	How about you? Will you be alright?
F	AUDREY	I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
M	BARTON	Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
F	AUDREY	I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
M	BARTON	Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
F	AUDREY	Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
M	BARTON	Please, Barton.
F	AUDREY	Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
M	MAYHEW'S VOICE	M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
M	BARTON	I see.
F	AUDREY	...I know this must look... funny.
M	BARTON	No, no –
F	AUDREY	We need each other. We give each other... the things we need –
M	VOICE	M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of bitches... the water's lappin' up... M'HONEY!!
F	AUDREY	I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't judge us. Please...
M	CHARLIE	Howdy, neighbor.
M	BARTON	Charlie. How are you.
M	CHARLIE	Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I'd drop by.
M	BARTON	Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
M	CHARLIE	Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing. Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
M	BARTON	Seen a doctor?
M	CHARLIE	Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me? Can't trade my head in for a new one.
M	BARTON	No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
M	CHARLIE	Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
M	BARTON	Nope.
M	CHARLIE	I myself have yet to be lassoed.
M	CHARLIE	...Got a sweetheart?
M	BARTON	No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back – with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
M	BARTON	My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
M	CHARLIE	Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
M	CHARLIE	...What's the expression – me myself and I.
M	BARTON	Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie? I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
M	CHARLIE	Mm... You're no stranger to loneliness, then. I guess I got no beef; especially where the dames are concerned. In my line of work I get opportunities galore – always on the wing, you know what I'm saying. I could tell stories to curl your hair – but it looks like you've already heard 'em! ...That's me in Kansas City, plying my trade.
M	CHARLIE	...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton. They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
M	BARTON	You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie. Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
M	BARTON	...and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don't know anything about.
M	BARTON	...This must be boring you.
M	CHARLIE	Not at all. It's damned interesting.
M	BARTON	Yeah...
M	BARTON	...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
M	CHARLIE	Beery! You got no beef there! He's good. Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
M	BARTON	Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
M	CHARLIE	Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
M	CHARLIE	...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
M	BARTON	That's all right, really –
M	CHARLIE	Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
M	CHARLIE	...and your left hand here.
M	CHARLIE	...You can do it, champ!
M	CHARLIE	...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!" you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
M	BARTON	...Yeah, okay.
M	CHARLIE	Ready... wrestle!
M	CHARLIE	Damn, there I go again. We're gonna wake the downstairs neighbors. I didn't hurt ya, did I?
M	BARTON	It's okay, it's okay.
M	CHARLIE	Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
M	CHARLIE	...Jesus, I did hurt you!
M	CHARLIE	...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I sure do apologize.
M	CHARLIE	...You sure you're okay?
M	BARTON	I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. Actually, it's been helpful, but I guess I should get back to work.
M	CHARLIE	Well, it wasn't fair of me to do that. I'm pretty well endowed physically.
M	CHARLIE	...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't be much of a match for you at mental gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you need anything. BY W.P. Mayhew"
M	MAYHEW	If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
F	AUDREY	That's hamburger grease, Bill.
M	MAYHEW	Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
M	MAYHEW	...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
M	BARTON	Well... actually, no Bill...
M	BARTON	...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering. Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
M	MAYHEW	Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
M	MAYHEW	...This'll sometimes help.
F	AUDREY	That doesn't help anything, Bill.
M	BARTON	That's true, Bill. I've never found it to help my writing.
M	MAYHEW	Your writing? Son, have you ever heard the story of Soloman's mammy-
F	AUDREY	You should read this, Barton. I think it's Bill's finest, or among his finest anyway.
M	MAYHEW	So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
F	AUDREY	Bill –
M	BARTON	Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
M	MAYHEW	And what would that be, son?
M	BARTON	I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
M	MAYHEW	No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
M	BARTON	What's that?
M	MAYHEW	I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
F	AUDREY	Maybe you better too, Barton. Before you get buried under his manure.
M	MAYHEW	M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
F	AUDREY	Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
M	BARTON	You're lucky she puts up with as much as she does.
M	MAYHEW	Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
F	AUDREY	Stop it, Bill!
M	MAYHEW	The truth, m'honey, is a tart that does not bear scrutiny.
M	MAYHEW	Breach my levee at your peril!
F	AUDREY	Let him go.
M	BARTON	That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
M	MAYHEW	I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
M	BARTON	Are you all right?
M	MAYHEW	Silent upon a hill in Darien!
M	BARTON	Audrey, you can't put up with this.
F	AUDREY	...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
M	BARTON	What?! He's a son of a bitch!
F	AUDREY	No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
M	BARTON	Really?...
M	BARTON	...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
F	AUDREY	He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
M	BARTON	Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
F	AUDREY	Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
M	BARTON	What. What don't I understand?
M	CHARLIE	I hope these are your shoes.
M	BARTON	Hi, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Because that would mean they gave you mine.
M	BARTON	Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
M	CHARLIE	Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
M	BARTON	Seems like nothing but, lately.
M	CHARLIE	Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
M	BARTON	Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
M	CHARLIE	A little lift, yeah...
M	CHARLIE	...Good thing they bottle it, huh pal?
M	CHARLIE	...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
M	BARTON	Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
M	CHARLIE	Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
M	CHARLIE	...Finally decided to knock off early, take your advice. Went to see a doctor about this.
M	CHARLIE	...He told me it was an ear infection. Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I told YOU my ear was infected. Why don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, THAT led to an argument...
M	CHARLIE	...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
M	BARTON	Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer. Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
M	CHARLIE	Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
M	BARTON	How did you know about that?
M	CHARLIE	Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
M	BARTON	Yeah, but –
M	CHARLIE	Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
M	CHARLIE	...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
M	BARTON	Where there's life there's hope.
M	CHARLIE	That proves you really are a writer!
M	BARTON	And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
M	CHARLIE	Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
M	BARTON	You're leaving?
M	CHARLIE	In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
M	BARTON	I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
M	CHARLIE	Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face! This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
M	CHARLIE	...And – mark my words – by the time I get back you're picture'll be finished. I know it.
M	BARTON	New York can be pretty cruel to strangers, Charlie. If you need a home-cooked meal you just look up Morris and Lillian Fink. They live on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.
M	CHARLIE	Christ!
M	CHARLIE	...Your room does that too?
M	BARTON	I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
M	CHARLIE	What a dump...
M	CHARLIE	...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
M	BARTON	Well...
M	CHARLIE	Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
M	BARTON	What do you mean?
M	CHARLIE	This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
M	BARTON	Well, I guess you pick your poison.
M	CHARLIE	So they say.
M	BARTON	Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
M	CHARLIE	Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
F	SECRETARY	Barton Fink.
F	GEISLER	Yeah. Fink. Come in.
F	GEISLER	Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
M	BARTON	Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
F	GEISLER	Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
M	BARTON	Well I...
F	GEISLER	On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
M	BARTON	Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
F	GEISLER	Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?! You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
M	BARTON	Well not much.
F	GEISLER	What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
M	BARTON	I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
F	GEISLER	Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
M	BARTON	Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
F	GEISLER	Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
M	BARTON	He's a great writer –
F	GEISLER	A souse!
M	BARTON	You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
F	GEISLER	Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
M	BARTON	But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
F	GEISLER	You thought! Where'd you get THAT from? You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
M	BARTON	I don't understand-
F	GEISLER	Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
M	BARTON	I didn't say anything-
F	GEISLER	Well he's taken an interest! That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line. He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
M	BARTON	I can't write anything by tomorrow.
F	GEISLER	Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read. You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
M	BARTON	Well what do I tell him?
F	GEISLER	Projection...
F	GEISLER	... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of the screening rooms free this afternoon?... Good, book it for me. A writer named Fink is gonna come in and you're gonna show him wrestling pictures... I don't give a shit which ones! WRESTLING pictures! Wait a minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg shooting one now?... Show him some of the dailies on that.
F	GEISLER	...This ought to give you some ideas.
F	GEISLER	...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes. Don't cross me, Fink.

M	BARTON	Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 605. Can you try a number for me in Hollywood... Slausen 6-4304.
M	BARTON	Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
F	AUDREY	Hello.
M	BARTON	Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
F	AUDREY	...Who is this?
M	BARTON	Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
M	MAYHEW	Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all!
F	AUDREY	Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
M	MAYHEW	Drown all those rascals...
M	BARTON	I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
M	MAYHEW	I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
F	AUDREY	All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
M	MAYHEW	Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
M	BARTON	If you could, I'd –
F	AUDREY	If I can. He gets jealous; he-
M	MAYHEW	Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
M	BARTON	I need help, Audrey.
F	AUDREY	I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
M	MAYHEW	Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
F	AUDREY	Hello, Barton.
M	BARTON	Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you. I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
F	AUDREY	Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
M	BARTON	Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
F	AUDREY	Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
M	BARTON	Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
F	AUDREY	It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
M	BARTON	No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
F	AUDREY	Yes, I'm afraid I have.
M	BARTON	What are they like? What are they about?
F	AUDREY	Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect. Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
F	AUDREY	...Barton.
F	AUDREY	...Look, it's really just a formula. You don't have to type your soul into it. We'll invent some names and a new setting. I'll help you and it won't take any time at all. I did it for Bill so many times –
M	BARTON	Did what for Bill?
F	AUDREY	Well... THIS.
M	BARTON	You wrote his scripts for him?
F	AUDREY	Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
M	BARTON	You wrote Bill's scripts! Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
F	AUDREY	Before what?
M	BARTON	Before Bill came to Hollywood.
F	AUDREY	Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
M	BARTON	What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
F	AUDREY	Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
M	BARTON	I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
F	AUDREY	Barton!
M	BARTON	I want to know!
F	AUDREY	Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
M	BARTON	Hah!
F	AUDREY	And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
M	BARTON	I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
M	BARTON	...W.P. Mayhew. William Goddamn Phony Mayhew. All his guff about escape. Hah! I'LL say he escaped!
M	BARTON	...Well, we don't have much time.
F	AUDREY	It'll be fine... Don't judge him, Barton. Don't condescend to him...
F	AUDREY	...It's not as simple as you think. I helped Bill most by appreciating him, by understanding him. We all need understanding, Barton. Even you, tonight, it's all you really need...
M	CHARLIE	Are you all right?
M	CHARLIE	...Can I come in?
M	BARTON	No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
M	CHARLIE	Are you sure –
M	BARTON	No... no...
M	CHARLIE	Barton. Are you all right?
M	BARTON	No... Can I come in?
M	CHARLIE	Why don't we go to your room-
M	BARTON	Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
M	CHARLIE	Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
M	BARTON	Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
M	BARTON	...Will you stay with me till they get here?
M	CHARLIE	Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
M	BARTON	Before you go in – I didn't do this. I don't know how it happened, but I didn't... I want you to know that...
M	CHARLIE	Okay.
M	CHARLIE	Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...
M	CHARLIE	...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this? What're we gonna do?
M	BARTON	I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
M	CHARLIE	Hold on –
M	BARTON	You gotta believe me –
M	CHARLIE	Hold on –
M	BARTON	I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
M	CHARLIE	Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
M	BARTON	I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
M	CHARLIE	I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
M	BARTON	We gotta call the police –
M	CHARLIE	Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
M	BARTON	Yeah.
M	CHARLIE	What do you think happened?
M	BARTON	I don't know! Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know. Won't the police be able to –
M	CHARLIE	Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
M	BARTON	But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
M	CHARLIE	I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
M	CHARLIE	...Did you... Barton, between you and me, did you have sexual intercourse?
M	CHARLIE	Jesus... They can tell that...
M	BARTON	They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
M	CHARLIE	You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
M	CHARLIE	...Wait in the bathroom.
M	CHARLIE	You passed out.
M	BARTON	...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
M	CHARLIE	She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
M	CHARLIE	Barton, listen to me. You gotta act like nothing's happened. Put this totally out of your head. I know that's hard, but your play from here on out is just to go about business as usual. Give us some time to sort this out...
M	CHARLIE	...Just put it out of you head...
M	LIPNIK	Bart! So happy to see ya!
M	LIPNIK	Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then talk! Drink?
M	BARTON	Yeah... rye whiskey?
M	LIPNIK	Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard! That's what I hear, anyway...
M	LIPNIK	... Lou.
M	LIPNIK	Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're going along great. Thinks we've got a real winner in this one. And let me tell you something, I'm counting on it. I've taken an interest. Not to interfere, mind you – hardly seems necessary in your case. A writer – a storyteller – of your stature. Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting in the audience, the lights go down, Capitol logo comes up... you're on!
M	BARTON	Yeah, okay... well... we fade in...
M	BARTON	...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
M	LIPNIK	Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
M	BARTON	And then... well...
M	BARTON	...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
M	LIPNIK	CAN you? You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean. Not cleaning the pool.
M	BARTON	Well... to be honest, I'm never really comfortable discussing a work in progress. I've got it all worked out in my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words – prematurely – the wrong words – well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind, and you never get it back – so I'd just as soon not talk about it.
M	LOU	...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never mind how long I've been in pictures. Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just about since they were invented. HE practically invented them.
M	LOU	...Now I think if he's interested in what one of his contract employees is doing while he draws pay, I think that employee ought to tell him, if he wants to stay an employee. Right now the contents of your head are the property of Capitol Pictures, so if I were you I would speak up. And pretty goddamn fast.
M	LIPNIK	You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling this man – this ARTIST – what to do?!
M	LOU	Mr. Lipnik, I –
M	LIPNIK	This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it! Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
M	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-
M	LIPNIK	Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch! Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
M	LOU	Mr. Lipnik, please –
M	BARTON	I – Mr. Lipnik –
M	LIPNIK	KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
M	LIPNIK	...Okay, get out of here. You're fired, you understand me? Get out of my sight.
M	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik, I –
M	LIPNIK	I apologize, Barton.
M	BARTON	No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
M	LIPNIK	You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
M	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
M	LIPNIK	Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
M	LIPNIK	...You know in the old country we were taught, as very young children, that there's no shame in supplicatin' yourself when you respect someone.
M	LIPNIK	...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, the administration, and all a the stockholders, please accept this as a symbol of our apology and respect.
M	CHARLIE	Barton. Can I come in?
M	BARTON	Jesus... You're leaving.
M	CHARLIE	Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
M	BARTON	Jesus, Charlie, I...
M	CHARLIE	Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
M	BARTON	Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
M	BARTON	...that I can talk to.
M	CHARLIE	It's okay... It's okay...
M	BARTON	Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
M	BARTON	...I just don't know what... to do–
M	CHARLIE	You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
M	BARTON	Yeah, but Charlie –
M	CHARLIE	Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
M	CHARLIE	...Look, pal – can you do something for me?
M	CHARLIE	...Keep this for me, till I get back.
M	CHARLIE	...It's just personal stuff. I don't wanna drag it with me, but I don't trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like to think it's in good hands.
M	BARTON	Sure, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
M	BARTON	It's more than I've got.
M	CHARLIE	Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
M	CHARLIE	...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll lick that story of yours.
M	BARTON	Thanks, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. You're gonna be fine.
M	BARTON	You'll be back?
M	CHARLIE	Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
M	BARTON	Hello... Chet... Who?...
M	BARTON	... No, don't send them up here. I'll be right down.
M	BARTON	...You read the Bible, Pete?
M	PETE	Holy Bible?
M	BARTON	Yeah.
M	PETE	I think so... Anyway, I've heard about it.
M	POLICEMAN	Fink?
M	BARTON	Yeah.
M	POLICEMAN #2	Detective Mastrionotti.
M	POLICEMAN #1	Detective Deutsch.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	L.A.P.D.
M	BARTON	Uh-huh.
M	DEUTSCH	Got a couple questions to ask ya.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	What do you do, Fink?
M	BARTON	I write.
M	DEUTSCH	Oh yeah? What kind of write?
M	BARTON	Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Big fuckin' deal.
M	DEUTSCH	You want my partner to kiss your ass?
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Would that be good enough for ya?
M	BARTON	No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
M	DEUTSCH	What DID you mean?
M	BARTON	I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
M	BARTON	Yeah.
M	DEUTSCH	How long you been up there, Fink?
M	BARTON	A week, eight, nine days –
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Is this multiple choice?
M	BARTON	Nine days – Tuesday –
M	DEUTSCH	You know this slob?
M	BARTON	...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
M	DEUTSCH	Ever talk to him?
M	BARTON	...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
M	DEUTSCH	His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Also known as Madman Mundt.
M	DEUTSCH	He's a little funny in the head.
M	BARTON	What did... What did he –
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
M	DEUTSCH	Yeah, he's funny that way.
M	BARTON	I...
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
M	DEUTSCH	Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
M	DEUTSCH	All of which he's now missin'.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Well, some of his throat was there.
M	DEUTSCH	Physician, heal thyself.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Good luck with no fuckin' head.
M	DEUTSCH	Anyway.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
M	DEUTSCH	Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
M	MASTRIONOTTI	But, you know, with the head still on.
M	BARTON	...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
M	DEUTSCH	So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
M	BARTON	Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
M	DEUTSCH	Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
M	BARTON	Well that's what he said.
M	DEUTSCH	What else?
M	BARTON	He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
M	DEUTSCH	Ya see how he's not writing it down?
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
M	BARTON	Yeah.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Yeah, I didn't think this dump was restricted.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	...Mundt has disappeared. I don't think he'll be back. But...
M	MASTRIONOTTI	...give me a call if you see him. Or if you remember something that isn't totally idiotic.
M	WOMAN	Just a minute and I'll connect you...
M	BARTON	Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh!
M	VOICE	...Hello.
M	BARTON	Garland, it's me.
M	GARLAND	Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
M	BARTON	Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
M	GARLAND	Okay.
M	GARLAND	...It's Barton. Calling long distance.
M	GARLAND	...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
M	BARTON	I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
M	GARLAND	Go ahead, son.
M	BARTON	It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
M	GARLAND	What do you mean, Barton?
M	BARTON	Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
M	GARLAND	Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
M	BARTON	Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
M	GARLAND	...That's fine.
M	BARTON	Have you read the Bible, Garland?
M	GARLAND	...Barton, is everything okay?
M	BARTON	Yes... Isn't it?
M	GARLAND	Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little –
M	BARTON	Sound a little what?
M	GARLAND	Well, you just... sound a little–
M	BARTON	Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the encouragement.
M	BARTON	...Nitwit.
M	"THE BURLYMAN	Motion Picture Scenario By Barton Fink"
F	GIRL	You're cute!
M	SAILOR	'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?
M	BARTON	This is MY dance, sailor!
M	SAILOR	C'mon buddy, I'm shipping out tomorrow.
M	BARTON	I'm a writer! Celebrating the completion of something GOOD! Do you understand that, sailor? I'm a WRITER!
M	VOICES	Step aside, four-eyes! Let someone else spin the dame! Give the navy a dance! Hey, Four-F, take a hike!
M	BARTON	I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE! He points at his head.
M	BARTON	...This is my uniform!
M	BARTON	...THIS is how I serve the common man! THIS is where I –
M	PETE	This stop: six.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Mother: What is to become of him. Father: We'll be hearing from that crazy wrestler. And I don't mean a postcard. Fade out. The end.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	...I thought you said you were a writer.
M	DEUTSCH	I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
M	BARTON	Keep your filthy eyes off that.
M	DEUTSCH	You made morning papers, Fink.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Second one of your friends to end up dead.
M	DEUTSCH	You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
M	DEUTSCH	Give you nose bleeds?
M	DEUTSCH	Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd you put their heads?
M	BARTON	Charlie... Charlie's back...
M	MASTRIONOTTI	No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
M	DEUTSCH	Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	Only fry you once.
M	BARTON	Could you come back later? It's just... too hot... My head is killing me.
M	DEUTSCH	All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
M	MASTRIONOTTI	He teach you to do it?
M	DEUTSCH	You two have some sick sex thing?
M	BARTON	Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
M	MASTRIONOTTI	You're a sick fuck, Fink.
M	DEUTSCH	All right, moron, you're under arrest.
M	BARTON	Charlie's back. It's hot... He's back.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	...Fred...
M	DEUTSCH	Sit tight, Fink.
M	DEUTSCH	Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
M	MASTRIONOTTI	...Fred...
M	DEUTSCH	... Show yourself, Mundt!
M	DEUTSCH	...Mundt!
M	MASTRIONOTTI	There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy case down and your mitts in the air.
M	MASTRIONOTTI	He's complying.
M	CHARLIE	LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!
M	CHARLIE	LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!
M	CHARLIE	Heil Hitler.
M	CHARLIE	Barton!
M	CHARLIE	...Brother, is it hot.
M	CHARLIE	How you been, buddy?
M	CHARLIE	...Don't look at me like that, neighbor. It's just me – Charlie.
M	BARTON	I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
M	CHARLIE	Jesus, people can be cruel...
M	CHARLIE	...if it's not my build, it's my personality.
M	CHARLIE	...They say I'm a madman, Barton, but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try and help them out...
M	CHARLIE	...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels like, when things get all balled up at the head office. It puts you through hell, Barton. So I help people out. I just wish someone would do as much for me...
M	CHARLIE	...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets so hot, I wanna crawl right out of my skin.
M	BARTON	But Charlie – why me? Why –
M	CHARLIE	Because you DON'T LISTEN!
M	CHARLIE	...Jesus, I'm dripping again.
M	CHARLIE	...C'mon Barton, you think you know about pain? You think I made your life hell? Take a look around this dump. You're just a tourist with a typewriter, Barton. I live here. Don't you understand that...
M	CHARLIE	...And you come into MY home... And you complain that I'M making too... much... noise.
M	BARTON	...I'm sorry.
M	CHARLIE	Don't be.
M	CHARLIE	I'm getting off the merry-go-round.
M	CHARLIE	...I'll be next door if you need me.
M	CHARLIE	...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. And Uncle Dave?
M	CHARLIE	...Good people. By the way, that package I gave you? I lied. It isn't mine.
M	BARTON	Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- five Fulton Street!
M	OPERATOR	I understand that, sir –
M	BARTON	Or Uncle Dave!
M	OPERATOR	I understand that, sir, but there's still no answer. Shall I check for trouble on the line?
M	LIPNIK	Fink.
M	BARTON	Mr. Lipnik.
M	LIPNIK	Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
M	LIPNIK	...Siddown.
M	LIPNIK	...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
M	BARTON	Congratulations.
M	LIPNIK	Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards. They'd love to see me sit this one out.
M	BARTON	Yes sir, they –
M	LIPNIK	Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
M	LIPNIK	...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
M	BARTON	With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
M	LIPNIK	Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
M	BARTON	Yes sir.
M	LIPNIK	I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back. After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
M	LOU	Yes, Colonel.
M	LIPNIK	Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
M	LOU	"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
M	LIPNIK	Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
M	BARTON	I'm sorry if I let you down.
M	LIPNIK	You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired. That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way. Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
M	BARTON	I tried to show you something beautiful. Something about all of US –
M	LIPNIK	You arrogant sonofabitch! You think you're the only writer who can give me that Barton Fink feeling?! I got twenty writers under contract that I can ask for a Finktype thing from. You swell-headed hypocrite! You just don't get it, do you? You think the whole world revolves inside whatever rattles inside that little kike head of yours. Get him outta my sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in town, though; he's still under contract. I want you in town, Fink, and outta my sight. Now get lost. There's a war on.
F	BEAUTY	I said it's a beautiful day...
M	BARTON	Yes... It is...
F	BEAUTY	What's in the box?
M	BARTON	I don't know.
F	BEAUTY	Isn't it yours?
M	BARTON	I... I don't know...
M	BARTON	...You're very beautiful. Are you in pictures?
F	BEAUTY	Don't be silly.
